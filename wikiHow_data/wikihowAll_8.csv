Trust your teammates.",How to Quarterback for a Football Team," Quarterbacks have to be smart on the field. A quarterback has to remember every single play in the playbook and do it correctly. Not only do you need to know coverages and plays but also how to read them. You also need to know every play in the playbook and how to perform it. Only one way to do this and that's study, it might be long and boring but it's crucial to become a great QB.;
, Quarterbacks need to control the game. There is no room for error in a football game so quarterbacks need to keep their heads up. Make sure to be a leader during practices too. Your team won't respect you if you only goof off during practices and then try to tell them what to do in the game.


Make sure to always be calm and collected. If you make a bad throw or your team starts losing, don't freak out. You need to be the leader of the team and be able to rally your team and get them back into it.

, You'll need to throw the ball far and be accurate when you throw. You need to have great arm and leg strength. In order to throw far and on target, develop strong arms and strong legs to step into the throw. Ways to work on these are push ups, crunches, pull ups, etc.


The stronger legs you have, the better the footwork, and you'll have increased accuracy in passing, and even more throw power.







, You must be able to read coverages, and see mismatches.

, You must make your throws before the receiver makes his break/cut so that the ball gets to the receiver as soon as he gets open.

, Accuracy is one of the most important attributes to being a successful quarterback. You need to be able to throw on target and on the move. A great way to build up your accuracy is to throw between tires, or at certain objects.

, Speed is not critical, but is useful. Sometimes a QB will find a big defensive gap and decide to run instead of pass. But if you can barely run, this will be very little help. Practice by running ladders or doing a daily exercise. It will build your ability very quickly.

, When playing a game, it is important to know who's open or if you need to run. You can build your awareness in many different ways. Being on a team or practicing with friends never hurts.

, You must be able to read a defense. That way you don't get sacked for a loss or even fumble.

,, If you're not as fast as Michael Vick, do not try to dance around in the pocket. Hit the open receiver or get rid of the ball.

, Instead, focus calmly and throw it away to a safe area, or just wrap the ball and take the sack. Sometimes it is better to just take the 5–10 yard (4.6–9.1 m) loss then take a chance and get intercepted.

,, No QB is perfect. You will miss some or turn some over. It's fine, it happens. Just move on and keep your spirits up.

, If you listen to the defense pre snap, then you can listen for clues that they're going to blitz. If you're running, then you should change it to a pass. But if they call an audible, see what formation they are in. If they are in a nickel and you're passing it, change the pass to a run.

, In order for any of these tips to work at all, you need to have people you know you can rely on to take a ball to the end zone, and do it with confidence. You can do this by meeting after games and talking with your running-back, wide receivers, linebackers, etc. and gain their trust as well as vice versa."

Choose a football team to follow.,
Learn the names and numbers of some of the star players on the team.,
Learn a few key football phrases.,
Keep conversations vague.,
Ask questions using the things you’ve learned.,
Remember one big play that happened in a game.,
Feed off the other fans, mimicking their reactions.",How to Pretend You Understand Football," It is best to start out this process with one team. By narrowing it down to one, you can learn specific details about that team to make you seem more knowledgeable of football. After you learn the techniques, they can be used to increase your credibility among the fans of other teams in the future.;
, More than likely, at least one of these specific players will have contributed to any given game. Knowing these names gives you a way to participate in conversations, without actually having to know the plays that were made. Talking about the players, though in a vague way, will make it seem as if you saw the plays they made.

, These can really come in handy during conversation, or during a game. Learn words like “touchdown”, “first down”, “field goal”, “pass interference”, etc. You don’t need to understand these terms, just know the words. If you hear these things said by the announcer during a game, remember them.

, You can use the names and key phrases you’ve learned, without having to understand the plays that occurred during a game. Using phrases like, “Wasn’t that interception awesome?”, or “Wow, what a game for Thompson”, you give the impression that you understand, when in fact, you only know small details like names.

, A good way to avoid any possible slip ups is by doing the asking yourself. Use questions like “What did you think of that play?” or “How did you think the game was going to turn out?”. Asking questions gives you the control, and helps you avoid talking about things you don’t understand.

, Remember the details of this one play, and it can take you a long way. This is always a good conversation turner. If things start to go down a path you don’t understand, you’re asked a hard question, or maybe you’re at a loss for something to talk about, just revert back to that one play. If it was a good play, chances are other fans will want to talk about it.

, Though you may not know what is going on down on the field, the people around you probably do. One of the easiest ways to pretend you understand is to do what the people around you do. If those around you cheer a play, cheer with them. If they yell angrily, do the same. The key to this step is to cheer and yell even louder than the other fans. Make your motions really exaggerated and animated, giving the impression that what just happened has greatly affected you. This makes people believe you are paying attention and know exactly what is going on.

Positive affirmations are not just for kids.Don’t be afraid to give yourself a pep talk now and then.
Even professional athletes feel pressure as stakes rise game by game.Whatever the stakes for next week’s game, stay cool and relax.;
, Each football game is a different battle. Your coaches will have specific goals and strategies lined up for the game ahead, and you and your teammates need to be proactive about getting on board.


The pros spend one or two days each week studying their next match-up and honing the right strategy.What works at one point in the season or against one team won’t always work at another time or against different opponents. Listen for changes to strategy.

, You can’t expect to play your best on game day if you haven’t given it your all during practice. Dig into drills without simply going through the motions, realizing that each aspect of practice is about preparing you for real in-game situations.Push yourself to improve not just stay in shape.

Eat a healthy meal a few hours before going to sleep.,
Make sure you have all your equipment ready for the next day.,
Get a full night’s sleep.Assuring enough rest before a day of strenuous activity is one of the most important elements of preparation for a big day.",How to Prepare for a Football Game2," A balanced meal consists of all three macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) in ratios appropriate to the body and lifestyle of the individual.However, many trainers recommend eating a meal focused more on carbohydrates the night before strenuous activity or sports to ensure sustained energy the next day.While recent research questions the efficacy of “carbo-loading” (the practice of “loading up” on complex carbohydrates in the days prior to endurance events), see what works for you.Give your stomach a couple hours to begin digesting the food before you hit the sheets to avoid indigestion and restless sleep., Have your jersey, socks, cleats, and other gear packed up and ready for heading out the door in the morning. Check the weather reports to see what extra layers or supplies you might need.

Eat the right breakfast for the day’s schedule.,
Prepare water bottles and any snacks or energy supplements you need.,
Keep your mental toughness in high gear.",How to Prepare for a Football Game3," If you have several hours before the football game, you can eat a balanced breakfast and follow up with low-sugar, protein-rich foods throughout the day. However, if the game starts earlier in the day, stick with a light, protein-rich breakfast.Avoid sugary foods at breakfast that will cause a “crash” later in the day.
Trainers and coaches disagree over whether athletes should drink caffeine on game day.Listen to your coaches and teammates but decide what works for you.
Maintain an active metabolism by eating small, healthy meals if you get hungry before the game., While eating sugary foods before the game starts is not recommended, recent research suggests that consuming simple sugars (sports drinks, gels, snacks) during strenuous activity can help sustain energy and improve performance.Staying hydrated even before the game starts is an important part of postponing muscle fatigue during play.
Some popular energy bars have a laxative effect so check labels carefully!

, As the game approaches, the mental preparation continues. Professional football players have all kinds of strategies for keeping their heads in the game as the clock ticks.Although Yogi Berra famously said “90 percent of this game is half mental” about baseball, it works for football too. Keep your head in the game!
If your school or team has a pep rally before the game, let yourself get into the excitement. Amp up your body to maintain your mental edge and toughness.

Take time for a warm up and some simple stretching.,
Get ready for the first kickoff.",How to Prepare for a Football Game5," Even the amateurs need to rest up before a big game, and a full eight hours of sleep can help you perform at your best.

, Whatever your diet, make sure you allow a few hours between the football game and your last meal. This will help you avoid cramps and stomach issues during play.

, Considering the venue of the game, the nature of the event, and the level of competition, decide what sports equipment you will need to play at your best and make sure clothing is clean and gear working properly.


Many football games mark the teams by asking players to wear certain colors or shades. Because teams can switch up during a day of football, it is smart to bring shirts for both teams.
Will you need indoor or outdoor shoes? Are your cleats clean? Your lucky socks?
If you are organizing the game or providing equipment, make sure you have all the necessary gear as early as you can! Cones for marking the field, mesh jerseys, extra footballs, trophies or certificates, flags and belts, etc.

, Whether you are playing for fun, for office bragging rights, or to raise money for a local charity, the football game will be more enjoyable if players develop a healthy amount of team spirit.


Friendly banter and light-hearted “trash talk” can be fun before a sporting event so long as everyone is respectful and playful.
Does your team have a clever name or rhyming cheer? Will your friends need signs or props to make the most of the game and support your team?
Consider sending out a playful text or email that pumps up the other players.

, Whether you are playing at a family reunion or company picnic, a football game might include dozens of players and spectators. Planning and logistics can be hectic for organizers.


Do your part to stay up to date with details on game day to help ensure a successful event.
Check the weather and traffic reports so you show up prepared and on time.
If you are organizing the game, be sure to alert the players to any changes in times or venues that might come up as the game approaches.

, There are various forms football can take, and the group should take time to make sure everyone knows what the local rules will be before they start strategizing. For instance:


How are you setting a first down? Every ten yards? Every two completions?
What are the rules for rushing? Counting to “ten alligator” slowly? One rush per first down?
How are you scoring touchdowns? Six points? Seven?
What are the rules for tackling? No grabbing clothes? Nothing near the head?
What counts as a player being “down” on a play? Do they have to be touched by an opponent?

, If you are playing in field or public park not specifically meant for football, you will need cones or other markers to define the boundaries of the field. For a football game, you will need to mark the end zones as well as the overall dimensions.


Use paces to count out the length and width of the field.
If you own the outdoor property you are playing on, consider using an environmentally friendly paint to mark the grass.

, Starting into strenuous activity with cold muscles can result in cramping and even injury.Do your body a solid by taking a quick jog or doing some calisthenics.

, When everyone is warmed up and ready, decide how the game will start and get the teams in position. Call hike and start the game!


Typically, whichever team receives the kickoff does not pick which side they aim for. This is especially useful outside when the wind and the direction of the sun can be important.

Play on the strong side of the formation.,
Take on the lead blockers.,
Contain the running back.,
Cover the tight end.",How to Play Outside Linebacker1," The outside linebacker on the strong side of the formation is often referred to as the Sam.Using the offensive center (the one who hikes the ball) as the middle line, the strong side of an offense is the side where more players lined up with the offense’s tight end usually among the strong-side players., The lead offensive blockers will try to hang up the defense and route the defensive line to make holes for running backs or tight ends. In addition to the rest of the defensive line, the Sam has to help close the gaps created and maintained by lead blockers.One of the keys to taking on lead blockers is in the “hit and shed” maneuver where a linebacker makes contact with a blocker then disconnects while maintaining the proper position.The correct stance for this requires the feet pointing forward just over shoulder-width apart, weight on the balls of the feet, back straight, head up, and knees flexed.Make contact with the side of the leading foot. To maintain balance, contact the blocker with the shoulder, forearm, or hand on the same side as the leading foot.Keep hips low and push upward on the blocker with the legs rather than simply upper body strength.By keeping the hips and stance low, the linebacker can equally keep his pads low, which helps to get under and uproot the blocker, thus allowing him to disconnect with the blocker and reassess the next movement for the play.The positioning to get under the pads and through the offensive blockers is very important for outside linebackers because the tackles and guards with whom they make contact often have distinct weight advantages.

, If a quarterback calls a running play, that means he’ll hand off the ball to the running back who will then try to find a hole in the defensive line. One of the duties of the Sam is to plug just such a hole in the defensive line to tackle the running back and stop him from getting through on the strong side.

, In addition to covering the running back in a rushing play, the Sam also needs to remain adaptable to covering the tight end who usually plays from the strong side of the offensive formation. Depending on the play, the tight end’s job can be to help stop the defensive line from blitzing the quarterback, block the defensive line to help make a hole for a running back, or to get open as an outlet receiver for when a quarterback doesn’t have time to complete a pass to a wide receiver. The Sam takes on the tight end in nearly every play, so he must quickly adapt to the role the tight end takes on any given play.


In the event that the tight end does manage to get open as an outlet receiver and the quarterback does complete a pass to him, it’s also the Sam’s job to tackle the tight end as soon as the pass is completed.

Know where to block.,
Know when, and when not to be aggressive.,
Avoid getting a penalty.,
Work on passing.,
Know your routes.,
Be able to keep the ball.,
Practice running the ball in case it's needed.,
Complete the route.,
Be able to improvise.",How to Play Tight End on a Football Team," In some plays, where the ball is being run by the running back, or the tight end is just not receiving, they will usually be lined up on the offensive line, blocking. Depending on the play, the tight end will block a few different people, but most of the time, it is the defensive end.;
, On blocking plays, your job is to keep the pocket open for the quarterback to get rid of the ball, or for the runner to get through the gap. If anyone on the offensive line fails to complete this task, the ball carrier will most likely be taken down.

, While it sounds like you have to try your absolute best to keep the defenders out, don't overdo it. While still blocking, make sure you don't hit too hard, or hold the defender. That will result in a penalty and have your team further back than it was before.

, Besides on blocking, the tight end is known for pass receptions. The majority of them are not long passes, but they still do pick up the first down, or get those few extra yards into the end zone.

, If the other receivers are covered, the quarterback is depending on you to be in the right place, in the right time. Most times, failure to complete routes result in a sack, or the quarterback being overwhelmed by defensive players.

, Most people can catch a football, but not all of them can secure it and protect it from being knocked out for an incompletion, or in worse cases, a fumble. If you see an open space after making the reception, go for it. Pick up all the yards you can to get your team further down the field.

, There are few plays where the tight end runs the ball, but there are some times where it's needed to pick up those last few yards for a conversion. It is better to know how to run the ball, rather than not know how, and get a turnover on the field.

, Every running play has offensive linemen ordered to keep an open space on the line of scrimmage, or outside the offensive line. If the route tells you to go between the left tackle and left guard, go there. Have trust in your teammates to get the spot open for you.

, Sometimes the linemen fail to provide an open space for you to run the ball. Don't give up and take the tackle behind the line. Be able to recognize another open spot on the line, or make your way through the line.

"
"
Cover cut-back running backs.,
Prevent passes to running backs or fullbacks.,
Blitz the quarterback.",How to Play Outside Linebacker2," The weak-side linebacker (commonly referred to as Will) is not by any means a weaker player, simply playing from the less-covered side without having to worry about the tight end. A running back who has been handed the ball may often cut to the weaker side of the formation depending on the play, in which case it is the Will’s job to tackle and halt progress of the ball.


Wills are often a bit lighter and faster than strong-side outside linebackers and middle linebackers. While the other two are akin to hammers pounding the lead and secondary blockers, the Will’s job is to penetrate and make a play on the ball., Many plays may call for a running back or fullback to come out of the backfield to act as an outlet receiver in the event that a quarterback senses trouble before being able to complete a longer pass. In these cases, it’s the Will’s job to cover the back to prevent a pass or at least tackle the back immediately after the pass is completed.

, Because it’s the Will’s job to exploit holes created by the rest of the defensive line to attack the ball, weak-side outside linebackers make their fair share of quarterback sacks.

Play the offensive line.,
Get in your 2 or 3 point stance and do not move until after the ball is snapped.,
Once the ball is snapped, get up and engage your defender as fast as possible same with the D line.

,
Once you're engaged, your assignment could be one of many:


run block - most likely are going to try to do a turn block to create a hole for the runner.,
When blocking on O line, bend at the knees slightly and use your legs to push your defender and then push upward at the same time so you get an upward and forward movement.,
Play the defensive line.,
When your team has the play picked line up at the defensive position, play will depend on which defensive play book or books you use.,
In your position, get in your 3 point stance.,
Pay attention to the snap count.,
Once engaged with an O Lineman, you have a number of options:


One option is to get around the O Line with a couple of moves.,
There are 3 to 4 moves to try to get around the O Line:


The first is the rip which is when you have one hand on one side of the defensive lineman and one on the other side in a way and you use one hand and just put all your muscle and try to ""rip"" the lineman out of your way.,
Play the fullback.,
Understand run blocking with the fullback.,
Know how to do pass blocking with the fullback.,
Running with fullback.",How to Play Offensive Line Defensive Line or Fullback in Football," The best offensive line can be small but you need to have lots of strength. Always know your assignment in any football position but especially with the offensive line because you could cause a sack.;
, Before the ball is snapped, get braced for assault by the D line and the linebackers.

,,
pass block - you're dropping back a bit and helping the quarterback from getting sacked by creating a pocket.
for the guards, this is one other type of movement called a pull. A pull is used on a run play or certain pass plays.

, If that is done correctly it should feel as trying to push someone over and flatten them.

, The good old D Line has many different tasks based on the team players and the offense. First, learn about the D line players:


Defensive Tackle or DT - these guys are the big guys trying to get a push on the O Line.
Defensive End - these guys can be big or small same with the Defensive Tackle. The DE job is to either rush the quarterback drop into zone coverage or play man coverage and stop the run
Note that there are many penalties associated with playing line and some are worse than others.

, The 2 most common defensive books are 3-4 or 4-3 3-4, which means 3 D Lineman 4 Linebackers and 4 Defensive Backs 4-3 means 4 D Line 3 Linebackers and 4 Defensive Backs

, Now is when you have to be paying attention or you are going be pummeled by the O Line or get called for a penalty.

, Get a good rush on the O Line whenever possible but don't go offside and encroach or get a neutral zone infraction. Everyone on defense should be a ""heat seeking missile"", especially the D Line. Look for whoever has the ball and find the best way to get there and punish the ball carrier

,
Second option is to cover your man if playing man coverage.
Third option is to drop into zone coverage.

,
The second move is to swim which is like the rip in a way but more of a finesse move. To swim, have your hands on the same positions as with the rip, then with your non-dominant hand push the lineman the direction of your dominant hand and at the same moment raise your dominant hand over the head of the O lineman.
The third move is the spin, which is self explanatory.

, The fullback is a combination O lineman Halfback and Tight End. As said above, the fullback has multiple roles which are pass blocking run blocking running the ball for short gains sometimes receiving the ball and even more rarely returning punts and kickoffs. Because of this, the fullback is required to have a different skill set then most players.

, When you are running a pitch or I form offense, the fullback is in front of the halfback and behind the QB and his job is to stay ahead of the running back to try to get a good block so the running back can get more yards.

, When pass blocking, remember to stay around the QB to try to create a pocket.

, If you are running, you most likely are only 1 to 3 yards (0.9 to 2.7 m) short of the first line or 5 yards (4.6 m) from the goal line. When playing fullback and running, your one and only job other than not to fumble, is to run the ball straight down the defense throat or dive for the touchdown.


Do not fumble the ball tuck it away and don't think about fumbling or don't even think about having the ball.

Hold the ball out in front of you, with the laces pointing up.,
Take two steps forward.,
Kick the ball right after you drop it.,
Follow through.",How to Punt a Football1," Grip it with your dominant hand as if you were going to give it a handshake, firmly holding it between your thumb and fingers. Extend your dominant arm as far in front of you as you can, continuing to hold the ball horizontally, with the laces still pointing up, pushing the ball out.








Angle the nose of the ball to point slightly in the opposite direction of your dominant hand (if you're right-handed, point it slightly to the left).;
, Stand in a controlled open stance, with your feet about a foot (.3 meters) apart, with one foot about 4 inches in front of the other (10 cm). It doesn't matter which foot is in front. Once you've positioned your feet, you'll need to take two steps forward -- the first with your kicking foot, the second with your other foot -- so that you've gained some momentum while keeping your kicking foot behind your other foot. 








Your forward steps should be smooth and controlled. Don't walk or run toward the ball; instead, approach it at a fast pace.
Take two normal-sized steps. Taking stutter steps or long strides will make it more difficult for you to punt the ball.

, The ball has to be dropped parallel to the ground so you kick it in the right direction. Kick your foot forward and drop the ball at the same time so that you kick the ball as late as you can, so you're almost kicking it out of your fingers without actually making contact with your hand. Kick your foot straight up so that it hits the ball dead on, instead of kicking it across your body, as many people have a tendency to do.








Your toes should be pointed forward and you should kick the ball with the top of your kicking foot.
Move your dominant hand away to the side, and lift your other hand in the air to help you follow through and gain momentum.
You should make contact at the height of your knee.

, Finish the kicking motion, kicking your leg almost as high as it will go to maximize the ball's height and speed. When you're done kicking, plant your foot back on the ground. Then, watch in awe as your ball travels over the field.

Stand 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage.








,
Call ""Hike!"",
Catch the ball.,
Prepare to punt the ball.",How to Punt a Football2,", when you are ready for the play. This will tell the center that you're ready for him to snap the ball to you.








, If you want to punt the ball, then you have to catch the ball without letting it hit the ground first. If you fumble the ball or just don't catch it completely, then you won't be able to punt it.








, Once you've caught the ball, get ready to take two steps forward and kick it forward using the top of your dominant foot.

Have fun.",How to Play Offensive Lineman," Lift weights about four to five times week. Do targeted workouts including the bench press, hang clean, squat, dead lift (which is also called the core lifts).;
, Start lifting weights. Coaches don't want that tall thin muscular player. Coaches prefer big powerful players who can dominate a defensive lineman.

, Avoid high-calorie fast food restaurants. Buy some lean meats bake them. On the side, consider foods like white rice, green beans, broccoli, and other greens. Pasta is a great choice as well.


For a post-workout meal, have something with a lot of protein in it. Most people skip this step you have to eat with in thirty minutes after you lift to help build more muscle.
Drink shakes, eat more meat and protein, anything to help you get into and stay in shape.

, Ask your trainer for knee braces. They'll help you in the long run and also may prevent serious knee injury. Additionally, ask your trainer to tape up your wrists and ankles.

Suit up.,
Gather your gear.,
Choose a playing field.",How to Play Flag Football1," Wear form-fitting athletic gear, such as t-shirts, shorts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants. Avoid baggy clothing, as well as anything with pockets or belt-loops, to reduce the chances of an opponent grabbing your clothes by mistake when they attempt to snatch your flag. Also avoid wearing clothes that are the same color as the flags that you will wear.Tuck your shirt into your waistband to keep the flags accessible.


Although there is no tackling in flag football, safety gear such as mouthguards and safety straps for glasses are still recommended.
Some leagues may require you to wear flat-soled or molded cleat shoes (meaning the cleats are actually part of the sole). Shoes with spikes or cleats that can be removed may be forbidden.Helmets and padding are not required. In fact, they are usually forbidden in official games.;
, Bring at least one American football to play with. Distribute flag belts to each player for them to wear around their waist. Also hand out three flags per player to attach to their belt.Make sure the flags for each team are one uniform color.If you don’t have belts, tuck the flags under your waistband. Tuck them far enough to keep them in place when you run, but so far in that your opponents can’t reach them or pull them free.
Fixing your flags so that they are harder to remove can result in ten-yard penalties if you’re caught, meaning that your team will lose ten yards at the start of your next down.

, Find an open space with level ground. For a full-sized field, look for a space that measures 53.33 yards wide (48.76 meters) and 120 yards (109.7 meters). However, for younger players (or if wide open spaces are hard to come by in your area), feel free to choose a field that is half or even a third of that size.The game should be played on level ground so no one team has an unfair advantage. Players who need to climb uphill to reach their end zone will face more challenges than opponents running downhill.
If you are able to play on an actual football field where the yards and end zones are already marked, great! If not, use cones or flags to mark your end zones. Trace your goal lines and sidelines with spray paint if possible so they are easier to spot.
End zones should be the last ten yards (9.1 meters) at either end of the playing field.This usually holds true even when playing on a smaller field.Recommended measurements for smaller fields include: 60 yards long by 20 yards wide (54.9 by 18.3 meters); 70 yards long by 25 yards wide (64 by 22.9 meters); 80 yards long by 30 yards wide (73.1 by 27. 4 meters).

Gather players.,
Appoint a captain for each team.,
Decide how long the game will last.",How to Play Flag Football2," Determine how many each team will have. To play with full teams, find nine people for each one. If that isn’t possible, aim for at least five players to a team.Teams should always have an equal number of players to avoid unfair advantages.

, Choose a player to represent the team as a whole. Although the quarterback often doubles as a captain, base your decision on their maturity, communication skills, and leadership. The captain will be responsible for:The team’s conduct as a whole.
Disputing calls on the team’s behalf.
Calling time-outs.
Participating in the coin toss.

, For a full-length game, plan for an hour of total playing time. Divide the game into four quarters, with 15 minutes to each quarter. For a quicker match, feel free to shorten the overall time.Simply divide that time into four equal quarters. Or, for a very short game, simply have two short halves of ten minutes each.Also, decide how long of a break you will have between each quarter and half. The break between the second and third quarter (halftime) is typically the longest. The other two breaks are of equal length.Break times vary from league to league in football.Halftime can be anywhere from five to twelve minutes.Breaks between quarters are usually one or two minutes."
"
Flip a coin.,
Start with a kick off.,
Start with a snap instead.",How to Play Flag Football3," Have the captain from each team meet with the referee and choose which side they will be: heads or tails. Then have the referee flip a coin. Allow the winner to choose which end zone they would like to protect in the first half or which team will start the game with possession of the ball.In the second half, have each team switch sides and protect the other end zone.This way, no one team will benefit from unfair advantages, such as a steady wind blowing from one end of the field to the other for the whole game.
Alternately, at the beginning of the third quarter you could also allow the loser of the coin toss a chance to choose which end zone they would like to protect in the second half.If you have no strong kickers, you can also the kickoff and start instead by granting the winner first down, starting from their five-yard line., Direct each team toward the end zones determined by the coin toss. The team kicking off should place the ball at their 20 yard line.Either set it directly on the ground or on a kicking tee, or have a player hold it in place for the kicker. Once the referee blows the whistle to start the game, kick the ball toward the other team. Whoever catches the ball on the other team may:Run the ball toward the opposite zone.
Execute a forward pass to another teammate.

, If you have no strong kickers, forget the kick-off. Simply start the game at the 5 yard line of whichever team possesses the ball according to the coin toss.Line at least four players along the line of scrimmage, with the “center” (the player snapping the ball to the quarterback) in the center of the field. Place the quarterback behind the center. At the whistle, proceed to play as you would after your first down.A snap is the backward pass from center to quarterback. It must be passed from between the center’s legs.
'A down is the interval of time when the ball is in play, starting from the center “snapping” the ball and ending with a touchdown or the ball going “dead” (meaning when an offensive player’s flag is removed by a defender or they go out of bounds). A player is also declared “down” when the ball is declared ""dead.""
The lines of scrimmage are two parallel lines extending from sideline to sideline, with each line crossing one end of the football, which in this case is placed on the 5 yard line with either end pointing toward an end zone.
The neutral zone is the area between each line of scrimmage at the start of each down. Neither team may cross into the neutral zone until the ball is “snapped.”

"
"
Cover the most ground possible.,
Get ready to play your first down.,
Snap the ball.,
Pass or run the ball.,
Play four downs.",How to Play Flag Football4," Whether you receive a kick-off or start with a snap, always aim to carry the ball as far as you can toward the opposite end zone. If you catch a kick-off, pass the ball to a teammate if they have a better chance of gaining more ground.Advance the ball as far as possible until you either reach the end zone and score a touchdown or are declared “down” enroute.When catching a kick-off, your entire body must be within bounds for the catch to count.The only exception is if you have to leap into the air to catch the ball, in which case one foot still must land within bounds. This rule is not universal, though, so have all sides agree to it before the start of the game if you wish to adopt it.
If you are unable to make it all the way to the end zone, you are “down” as soon as your opponents snatch one of your flags or force you out of bounds.
Although tackling is not permitted, you are still considered “down” if any part of your body other than your hands or feet comes into contact with the ground., Place the ball in the center of the field at the exact yard where it went “dead” (that is, the yard line where you were declared “down”). Assemble your team along your line of scrimmage. Position four players at the line of scrimmage itself, with the quarterback positioned behind whoever is playing center and snapping the ball to them.To be considered “at” the line of scrimmage, at least one part of your body (foot, upper torso, head, etc.) has to be within a yard of it.
Replace the flag that was snatched before you get into position. Starting a down with one less flag for your opponents to try for will automatically result in you being declared “down” again.

, Have the center pass the ball to the quarterback from between their legs in one fast, fluid motion. Until they do, the center must not shift their feet or raise their hands once they are in position. Be aware that any false start on the center’s part will result in a five-yard penalty, meaning that you will have to retreat five yards.No one is allowed to cross into the neutral zone until the ball has been snapped. Doing so will also result in a five-yard penalty.
Some rules dictate that all players must refrain from moving at all until the ball is snapped.Other rules allow players to move parallel to the line of scrimmage or farther back from it.

, Once the ball has been snapped, have the quarterback pass the ball to another player as they advance toward the end zone. Alternately, they can hand the ball off to another player behind the line of scrimmage, or they can run the ball themselves toward the end zone if no one is open. Be aware, however, that they are no longer allowed to pass the ball once they cross the line of scrimmage.Only one forward pass is permitted during one down.
A successful handoff to another player behind the line of scrimmage does not count as a forward pass, meaning this second player can then make a forward pass as long as they don’t cross the line of scrimmage.
You may make as many backward passes as necessary., Aim to gain at least ten yards in that time. Once you do, consider your next down your “first,” with four more chances to gain another ten yards. Keep advancing toward the opposite end zone in this manner.If you do not gain ten yards in four downs, surrender possession of the ball to your opponents, who may now start their own offensive run from your last line of scrimmage.
Once the line of scrimmage is within five yards of the end zone, you can only score by throwing a successful pass into the end zone, not by running the ball across the goal line."
"
Cover each opponent.,
Intercept passes and collect fumbles.,
Snatch their flags.,
Refrain from rough play.",How to Play Flag Football5," When the other team assembles along the line of scrimmage to snap the ball, place your own players so that each of the other team’s receivers will be covered once the ball is snapped. Place them as you see fit, since the defensive team is not obligated to place any players directly on the line of scrimmage. However, be sure to follow these rules:Do not place a player directly across from your opponent’s center at the line of scrimmage.
Wait until the ball is snapped before crossing the neutral zone.

, Turn your defense into an offense at any given opportunity. If possible, try to catch any passes thrown by your opponents and make a run for your end zone. If your opponents drop the ball without going “down,” try to recover it to claim possession for your team.


If you and your opponent catch the ball at the exact same time, the ball is still theirs.Do not physically interfere with an offensive player to prevent them from catching a ball. This will result in a ten-yard penalty., Instead of tackling your opponents, rip one of their flags from their belt or waistband once they catch the ball. If one or more of their flags have come off accidentally, use your hand to touch them anywhere between their shoulders and their knees..


If your opponent has all of his flags, refrain from touching their body at all. Doing so will automatically grant them an extra ten yards as a penalty against you.As soon as you have hold of their flag, raise it in the air so others see that you have it.

, Remember that flag football is a much gentler variation on traditional football. Expect roughhousing to be penalized. Avoid physical contact with your opponents, except for their flags. Refrain from:Physically forcing your opponent out of bounds.
Tackling them or trying to injure them with your arms or legs.

To play in central midfield, you need to be ultra fit, it's the most demanding position on the park.,
A football pitch is occupied by 22 players, always look for space, always keep moving, try to find yourself 5–10 yards (4.6–9.1 m) of radius space.

,
If you have the ball passed into your feet from the defence with your back to the opposition, always aim your first touch back towards your goal, i.e., where the ball came from, this means you won't be caught in possession and you'll have more time.,
When receiving the ball, take your touch and look for a pass, select the first pass you see on.

,
In the centre of the park, you should be looking to spend no more than three seconds on the ball, anymore and you could lose losing possession.

,
You're at the heart of the pitch, always be talking to the rest of the team (strikers, midfielders and defenders), you must be vocal.

,
If your defence has the ball, always drop back to help them out.

",How to Play in Central Midfield Football," It is essential you have good ball control as well as the ability to spot and execute a pass.;

Engage the defender.,
Run block.,

, You most likely are going to try to do a turn block to create a hole for the runner., You're dropping back a bit and helping the quarterback from getting sacked by creating a pocket.

For the guards there is one other type of movement call a pull.

A pull is used on a run play or certain pass plays.

, You're going to need to envision twenty-one other players on the field with you at the same time.

,, Pretend to be the public address announcer, this will make the game more legendary.

, You'll want the teams to be good, that way the game can be for the Super Bowl (or perhaps an AFC or NFC Championship, that way snow can be on the ground and the game does not have to be on a neutral site). Also, pick teams with players you know. It's way more fun to say ""And Brady goes deep to Moss!"" than ""And Quinn throws it to... ahh... who's the Browns receiver...""

, Start sprinting upfield. Envision tacklers coming at you. When one of them gets near you, tuck the ball under your left shoulder and with your right arm yank your right leg backward. This should successfully tackle you. If not, you just broke free! Keep going!

, Perhaps you'll start with a pass play. Put the ball on the ground, and clutch it with your right hand in a ""hiking stance."" Determine your play, perhaps call an audible, analyze the defensive formation that you've visualized in your head. Now snap the ball from your right hand to your left hand through your legs. Get the ball into a throwing position and go into a five step drop. Envision the defense charging at you, envision your receivers running their routes. One open? Throw it to him! Determine if you threw the ball where he was in your head, or if not. 'Cause now it's time to be the receiver.

, Now, go where you expected the receiver to be and run the route. Toss the ball up where you threw it (if it was a bad throw, make it a bad throw and try to come down with it!). Make the catch, keep running until you tackle yourself! Miss it, incomplete, try again.

, Feel free to ""be"" the player that's making the big play. Defensive lineman? Toss the ball up and swat it away! Running back, receive a handoff from yourself and jump the pile!

Determine the highest end of your heart rate zone by multiplying your maximum beats per minute by 85 percent.,
Measure your heart rate by counting your heartbeats for exactly 1 minute.,
Calculate your resting heart rate by counting your heart beats for 15 seconds and multiplying the result by the number 4 immediately after you wake up.,
Determine your heart rate reserve by subtracting you average resting heart rate from your maximum heartbeats per minute.,
Determine your heart rate zones for different training levels by adding your resting heart rate to various percentages of your heart rate reserve.",How to Work out Heart Rate Zones,"


For example, if you are a 30-year old man, subtract 30 from 220. Your maximum heartbeats per minute is 190.
You can also visit a doctor or health-care provider to have them calculate your maximum heart rate using different tests. Methods of testing may include a stress test or exercise tolerance test on a treadmill.;
,


For example, if your maximum beats per minute is 190, multiply 190 by 50 percent for a result of 95 beats per minute.
If your heart rate is lower than the lowest end of your heart rate zone while you exercise, you may need to intensify your workout routine to increase your heart rate.

,


If your maximum beats per minute is 190, take 190 and multiply it by 85 percent for a result of 161 beats per minute.
If your beats per minute is higher than the highest end of your heart rate zone during your workout, you may want to lessen the intensity of your exercise routine to prevent yourself from experiencing any injuries.

,


This can be done by placing your fingers on the carotid artery on your neck or on the radial artery on your wrist.
You can also wear a heart-rate monitor to determine your heart rate. Purchase a heart-rate monitor from a retail store or store that specializes in athletic equipment.

,


Continue to measure your heart rate after waking up for 5 days in a row for consistent readings and to find your resting heart rate average.
To determine the average of your resting heart rate after 5 days have passed, take the sum of all 5 heart rates and divide that result by 5. For example, if your heart rate sum equals 351, your average resting heart rate is 70.
Do not get out of bed before measuring your heart rate because it may increase your heart rate and cause inaccuracy in the readings.

,


For example, if your maximum heartbeats per minute is 190 and your average resting heart rate is 70, your heart rate reserve will be 120.

,


Burn fat during your workouts by using between 50 and 75 percent of your heart rate reserve.
Increase your stamina and endurance during workouts by using between 75 and 90 percent of your heart rate reserve.
Improve your athletic performance if you are an elite athlete by using between 90 and 100 percent of your heart rate reserve.
For example, if your goal is to burn fat during your workouts, and your heart rate reserve is 120, take 50 percent and 75 percent of that number to equal 60 and 90 respectively. If your resting heart rate is 70, add 70 separately to 60 and 90 for results of 130 and 160 respectively. You will burn fat when your heartbeats per minute is between 130 and 160.

Make teams.,
Make a field.,
Pick a kicking and receiving team.,
""Kick off"".,
The offensive team (the team with the ball) gets 4 (or whatever you want) downs (tries) to get to the end-zone, using passing (throwing the ball to receivers) and running (giving or flipping the ball to a runner) plays.,
There should be at least one defender on the quarterback counting ""steamboats"", or a predetermined number of seconds (counted 'one steamboat, two steamboat...') If the quarterback does not pass or make a play by the count of the last steamboat, defenders may tag the QB for a sack.,
Play resumes until 4th down and the offense has not reached the end-zone or if they score with a touchdown (reach the end-zone) or field-goal (""kick"" the ball into a certain large space ).,
On 4th down, the team must choose to go for it, punt, or try a field-goal.,
A turnover is when the defense gets the ball.,
On penalties- There are several different levels of intensity for penalties - minor, for small things and accidents, which are usually about 5% back; major, which are for slightly bigger things and a little more dangerous (like tripping), and are usually 10% back; ejections, which are for very dangerous things like fighting, which is out for the game; and suspensions and expulsions, both for repeated ejections and incidents, but the prior is a certain amount of games where you're not allowed to participate, and the latter, out of the league for good.,
Play resumes until a predetermined point, whether it's an hour, until the sun goes down, or a certain amount of points, it can be anything.",How to Play Baseball Football," You can do this however you like, from boys versus girls, old-school gym style and more. Just try to make the skill level about equal.;
, You can use anything from a real football field to pylons marking the corners. The players should be able to run end-zone to end-zone in about 10 seconds, and sideline to sideline in about 5-7.

, It can be a coin toss, rock paper scissors, or whatever you can think of.

, Back up to your back quarter (halfway between the half of the field and the end-zone) in the centre, pick a thrower, and show a thumbs up to show you and your team are ready. When the other team responds, set your defenders in motion, and throw the ball. The ball must travel at least 10 yards (or 10% of your field) before the kicking team can try to collect it, or it's a minor penalty. The receiving team will collect it, and attempt to run down the field, until they're tagged like in normal baseball. The play stops at the site of tagging.

, Every play starts either with the centre passing the ball to the quarterback or the QB starting with it. The QB says ""Hut"" and the play begins. If you traverse 10% or more of your field, you get a first down and an imaginary line 10% in front of you for another one. See the rules of football for more rules.

, If they do before, it's a minor penalty.

, A touchdown is worth 6 points and a field-goal attempt from the goal line for an extra point, and a field-goal that isn't after a touchdown is worth 3 points.

, If you go for it, you must get a first down, or the other team gets the ball at the line of scrimmage (where the play starts.) Punting is basically a kickoff from the line of scrimmage, and see about field-goals above.

, Mid-play turnovers are interceptions (a defender catching a pass) and fumbles (an offender drops the ball before being tagged and a defender gets it). Kicking turnovers are kickoffs, punts, and missed field-goals. Turnovers also occur if you fail to get a first down on 4th down.

, Yardage penalties can be reversed (forward instead of backward) if the defense incurs the penalty. Play always stops at the point of infraction.

, The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.

Start between your pinky and ring fingers.,
Make a second X.,
Make one last X. Repeat the same process.,
Wrap your thumb.,
Secure your thumb.,
Cover your knuckles.,
Velcro to finish.",How to Wear Hand Wraps," First, hold your hand up in an open position, palm-down. Spread your fingers and thumb apart. Then slip the wrap’s looped end over your thumb so that the wrap itself falls across the back of your hand.Be sure to begin wrapping your hand across the back of your hand rather than your palm. Beginning with the back of your hand will prevent the wrap from loosening later on.;
, Let the wrap fall from the outside (pinky-end) of your hand. Pull the loose end under your wrist, below the ball of your thumb. Then wind it over the top of your wrist, drawing it tight enough to provide support for your wrist, but not so tight that it cuts off circulation. Repeat so that you complete a total of two to three passes under and over your wrists.For extra support, wrap your wrist three times. However, if your wrap is too short, or if you prefer keeping your wrists a little loose for specific punching styles (like uppercuts and angled hooks), only wrap it twice.

, Once you have finished your wrist, let the loose end hang once again from the outside of your wrist. Pull the loose end under your palm to the area between your thumb and index finger. Draw it over the top of your hand, again making sure that you pull it tight enough for support, but not tight enough to restrict blood-flow. Repeat for a total of three passes under and over your hand.At this point, focus more on wrapping your hand securely rather than your knuckles.

, The loose end of your wrap should again be hanging from the outside of your hand. Draw it under your palm to where your wrist meets the ball of your thumb. From there, pull it over the top of your hand and down in between your pinky and ring fingers. Then draw the wrap to the inside of your hand. Pull it up and over your index knuckle and then across the back of your hand to where it meets your wrist.Looking at the top of your hand, you will now see that you have formed an X, with the loose end once again hanging off the outside of your hand.

, Draw the loose end under your hand so that it comes up below your thumb, as before. Now pull it over the top of your hand and down in between your ring and middle fingers. Draw the wrap to the inside of your hand. Pull it around your index knuckle and then cross the back of your hand again, finishing as before with the loose end hanging from the outside of your hand, at its bottom., Only this time, pull the wrap down in between your middle and index fingers. This way, each knuckle will be supported and safely separated from each other, reducing the risk of injury. Finish as before by drawing the wrap from the inside of your hand, across the back, and down around the bottom, where it meets your wrist., After you finish the last X along the back of your hand, pull the loose end under the bottom of your hand, below your thumb. Now wrap it over and under your thumb, covering the joint in the middle of your thumb. Only do so once. After that, flip your hand so that the palm faces up.

, Once you have flipped your hand over, draw the wrap along the back of your hand to where it meets your wrist on the pinky-side. Now pull it up and over the bottom of your palm to the base of your thumb. With your thumb spread wide, pull the wrap behind your thumb and then straight across your palm to its pinky-side., Pull the wrap around the backs of your knuckles. Then draw it over the base of your fingers along your palm. Repeat this twice, for a total of three wraps around your knuckles., Once you have wrapped your knuckles, draw what is left of your wrap down to your wrist. If you have excess material left, either wrap it around your knuckles as before, create more X’s across the back of your hand, or both. Once done, use the velcro to secure your wrap along your wrist. Clench your hand into a fist to make sure the wrap tightens when you do so.Be sure that any excess wrapping along your knuckles doesn’t prevent your glove from fitting. If your glove doesn’t fit with all that extra padding, use a shorter wrap.

Bounce the ball on your thigh.,
Use the bridge of your foot on the laces.,
Start using your non-dominant foot.,
Launch the ball up to your head, using either your foot or thigh.,
Practice consistently.,
Find the motion that works best for you.,
Do drills to get the technique just right.,
Watch the ball.,
Focus on your balance.,
Move the ball through a pattern.",How to Win at Kick Ups," Although soccer primarily uses the feet, beginners at kick ups should master using the thighs first because it’s a bit easier than foot juggling. The ball should hit the flat surface of the thigh, not anywhere on the knee. Drop the ball to the thigh, bounce it once, and catch it. Do this for enough reps to get the motion down before going for multiple bounces.;
, When the thighs are mastered, incorporate the feet. Drop the ball and make contact with it where the toes start. Keep your toes pointed slightly up so that the ball bounces up rather than forward.If you straighten your toes out to point forward, the ball is more likely to bounce away from you.
Start with one bounce at a time off your foot, making sure the ball goes straight up. When you get good at keeping the ball straight, go for more kicks in a row.

, Most people have a dominant foot, and it’s easier to let that foot do all the work, but the players who are best at kick ups will be equally strong with both feet. Once you get good with your dominant foot, begin practicing just as hard with your other foot.


This will give your dominant foot a break during competitive kicks ups and give you more options to get a pattern going.

, Kicking the ball with just the right amount of power up to your head is tricky and takes time to perfect. When you kick the ball into the air, it should be just out in front of your head so that you have to lean slightly forward to hit it. The ball should bounce off the flat part of your head rather than your forehead.


Work to hit the ball straight up off your head rather than forward or backward.
Moving the ball from your foot to your head may be a little easier than from your thigh to your head because you can get more power with your foot.

, Beating others at kick ups means being consistently better than them, which is only achieved by practicing. You should practice kick ups techniques every day to build the strength in your legs and to form muscle memory for the motion juggling the ball takes. One way to practice is to set a certain time limit for which you must work on the skills, and then increase this time a little bit every day.


Try to go for 10 seconds straight or for 10 reps without dropping the ball. Set a goal like this and then as you reach it, set a new, slightly higher goal.

, Being comfortable with juggling will help you win kick ups more often, so if a certain way of moving feels better, do it that way. Some people like to move the foot at the ankle to pop the ball up, while others prefer slightly extending the knee to kick at the ball. You can even move your bent leg up and down at the hip.Try using each approach for a few minutes and see which feels the most natural to you. Then get proficient at that style.

, You can’t start out with the goal of getting 50 bounces on the first try. On a hard surface, bounce the ball off the ground and kick it up once into your hands. Drop it again and kick it twice, with a bounce in between, before catching it. Then kick it twice with no bounce and catch it. This progression will help get the exact motion right before going for too long.You want the ball to go straight up after the kick without too much spin, so if you do one kick and it doesn’t go straight up, stay on that step of the drill until you can kick it straight up. This gives you a foundation to build on.
You can build on this basic drill by passing it from one foot to the other, going from foot to head back to thigh, or do 10 reps on the foot, then 10 on the thigh, then 10 on the head. The goal of drills is to get the technique right on a few reps before trying for the most reps.

, It may feel like keeping your eye on the ball makes you seem weak, but it is the most effective way to keep the ball going. You may think your foot or leg was positioned perfect for a pass up to your head, but watching the ball will help you know for sure. Where the ball goes will tell you whether or not you got the technique right.You can practice juggling the ball without looking, to push yourself, but when you are playing to win, watching will give you an added edge on your opponent.

, Kick ups requires you to be on one foot for an extended period of time, so having exceptional balance is a useful aspect to master. If you are wobbling all over the place with each kick, you will have less control of where the ball goes. Work hard to maintain upright posture and only move enough to keep the ball moving.A good way to practice is just standing on one foot for as long as you can, while staying up straight and not swaying. Once you can stand still for a long time, you’ll be able to practice the movement of kicking.

, Some people playing kick ups move the ball around at random and are constantly reacting to wherever the ball goes. You can win by having greater control than your opponent. Move the ball in a pattern, using each body part. If you move the ball in a pattern, you’ll know exactly where it is going rather than guessing.A good pattern might be right foot, left foot, left thigh, right thigh, head. Or you could go up the right side and down the left side by cycling right foot, right thigh, head, left thigh, left foot. The goal is planning ahead where you are passing the ball to.

Find a comfortable place.,
Start with deep breathing.,
Progress to breath of fire.,
Ground yourself with alternate nostril breathing.,
Try a guided meditation.,
Practice mindfulness in everyday life.,
Use equal breathing before sleep.",How to Use Yoga to Stay Healthy1," Yogic breathing and meditation can help calm your mind and relax your body, especially when you are feeling stressed out. To gain these benefits, find a cool, quiet place with few distractions.While it can be relaxing to meditate in a public park, if you are a beginner you may want to be somewhere more private so you can fully relax.
Start by getting into a comfortable seated position – either cross-legged or in a chair with your feet on the floor.;
, Deep yogic breathing will help relax and center you. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose to the depths of your chest, imagining that you are slowly filling your lungs from the bottom to the top.When you've inhaled as much as you can, pause for a moment to appreciate the feeling of your lungs being full of air. Then slowly exhale out of your mouth, thinking about releasing the air from your lungs from the top all the way to the bottom.
Pause again when you've exhaled all the air before beginning an inhale again. Continue this cycle, keeping your mind focused on your breath.

, Breath of fire is a powerful breathing technique that will give you energy. Use it especially when you find yourself dragging during the day or losing focus.Start with long, deep breathing. With breath of fire, rather than pausing and slowly exhaling, you will push the air out of your lungs quickly and forcefully out your mouth. As soon as most of the air in your lungs is gone, immediately inhale as much air as you can forcefully.
Engage your abdominals to push the air out when you exhale. With every breath cycle, try to inhale and exhale a little faster.

, Alternate nostril breathing can help calm you when you are having anxiety. After doing some deep yogic breathing to start, place your right thumb over your right nostril and inhale deeply through your left nostril.When you've inhaled all you can, use your fourth finger to close off your left nostril and lift your thumb so that you can exhale out of your right nostril. Replace your thumb and remove your fourth finger so you can inhale through the left nostril again.
Focus your mind on your breath, continuing this cycle for three to five minutes.

, You can take a guided meditation class, or look for free guided meditation recordings online. Recordings also may include relaxing music or other sound effects that will aid in relaxation.Close your eyes and focus on the voice, visualizing the images the voice tells you to in your mind. Guided meditations give you something to focus on, which can be useful when you're just starting to meditate and don't have practice clearing your mind.
Establish a regular practice of meditating for 5 to 10 minutes a day, either in the morning or in the evening before you go to bed. Over time you'll notice a difference in your anxiety levels and your mental focus and clarity.

, When you focus on your breath while meditating, you are being mindful of your breath. You can expand this mindfulness to other areas of your life. Actually focus on the things that you do throughout the day, rather than going through tasks on auto pilot while your mind is elsewhere.When you act consciously and mindfully, you'll see an impact in your health and well-being. For example, if you eat mindfully, you may find that you lose weight and adopt more healthy eating habits.

, Equal breathing is kind of like counting sheep, and allows you to focus on your breath to calm your body and stop your mind from racing at the end of a long and hectic day.Start by inhaling deeply as you count to four. Then immediately exhale for a count of four. Continue the cycle, focusing on the inhale and exhale being completely equal.
With practice, you can lengthen your count to five, six, or even eight.

Relax in child's pose.",How to Use Yoga to Stay Healthy2," You may be familiar with plank exercises from other workouts. The same pose exists in yoga, with more focus on maintaining a deep breath to strengthen your abdominal muscles.For a full plank pose, support yourself over the floor on your hands and toes so that your body is a straight line more or less parallel with the floor. Make sure your wrists are directly under your shoulders, and cup your palms to place less stress on the joint.
For a side plank, drop to your elbows with your forearms on the floor. Lift your body up on one side so that your weight is supported by one forearm and the side of one foot. Stack your hips and rest your other foot on top. Release to a low plank, then repeat with the other side.

, Both boat and low boat require every muscle in your core and hips to be engaged. Get into boat pose by sitting on your mat with your knees bent so that your feet are flat on the floor in front of you.Extend your arms out in front of you, palms just to the side of either knee. Lean back so that your torso is at about a 45-degree angle from the floor, then lift your feet to straighten your legs. Try to angle your legs upward at the same angle as your torso.
To progress into low boat, simply lower your torso until your lower back is flat on the floor. Lower your legs at the same angle at the same time, keeping your core engaged. Don't forget to maintain your deep breath.
Hold these poses for 3 to 5 breath cycles.

, Come to a standing position with your arms loosely to your sides to get into chair pose. Slide your feet together so that your big toes are touching, heels slightly apart.

On an exhale, bend your knees and lower your hips to the floor. Try to keep your knees from projecting out over your toes. They will move forward a little, but keep your shins as perpendicular to the floor as possible.
Hold the pose for 5 to 10 breath cycles, breathing deeply. Make sure your shoulders are rolled back and not hunched. Squeeze a yoga block or a book between your knees to further build your thigh muscles.

, Moving through the three main warrior poses provides a whole body workout, particularly strengthening your legs, back, and shoulders. From standing, step one foot back into a high lunge position to start.The toes of your front foot should be pointed forward, with your knee at a right angle directly over your ankle. Point the toes of your back foot to the side, so that your front ankle bisects your back foot. Keep your hips facing forward. Raise your arms straight overhead into Warrior I.
From Warrior I, drop your arms down to shoulder level and extend them out parallel to the floor. Twist and open your shoulders into Warrior II with your arms directly over your legs.
From Warrior II, turn to face forward, bringing both arms out directly in front of you. Raise up onto your front leg, standing firmly on your foot. Slowly lift your back leg up behind you as you hinge forward from your hips. Firm up your standing leg to maintain your balance in Warrior III.
Make sure to repeat the entire sequence on the other side.

, Downward facing dog is a classic yoga pose that also provides strengthening benefits for your entire body. To get into downward facing dog, start on your hands and knees on the floor. Make sure your knees are directly under your hips, your wrists directly under your shoulders.On an exhale, straighten your legs, lifting your hips up towards the ceiling. Roll over your feet onto your toes, stretching your heels down towards the floor. Your arms should be extended straight towards the floor. Roll your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades run along the sides of your spine.
Stay in downward dog for 5 to 10 deep breaths, pulling down through your heels and up through your shoulders to maintain weight balance and distribution. Relax your neck and allow your head to lower.

, Child's pose is a common way to end any yoga routine, because it allows your body to relax and allows you to return your focus to your breath. Child's pose also provides strengthening and lengthening for your spine and back muscles.Lower onto all fours from downward dog, then continue to drive your hips back until you are resting on your heels. You can draw your knees together or keep them spread.
Hinge forward from the hips as you slide your hands forward, folding over your legs to the floor. Rest your forehead on the floor if it's comfortable.
You can stay in child's pose as long as you want, focusing on your breath.

, It only makes you more scared. If you focus on one thing, then you will have better balance. Try to focus on something slightly above eye level in the air; this helps keep your chin up so you look more confident.

, Do this by squeezing everything in and pushing yourself up. This makes it easier for your bases to hold you. It also makes it easier for you to keep balanced!

, If your coach asks you to do something that you are unsure of, try! If you don't, you might lose your spot!

, Judges point you very harsh on it.

, Being a flyer has many challenges, including having faith and trust with the people whom are holding you up. Don't blame one another think what you could've done to make the stunt go better.

, You can't be afraid and questioning things while being thrown into the air trying to spin. There should be nothing on your mind except for what you're doing and it should only be about spinning or whatever your stunt includes!

, Don't try to balance yourself because your knees will become loose and you will fall! It's up to the bases to balance you; if one is higher than the other, tilt. Never bend your knees you can tap the leg that's higher. Try to stand in the center of your foot and don't shift your weight.

, Don't fall on one person.

Learn about Cheer.,
Start the road.,
Work on flexibility.,
JUMP JUMP JUMP!,
Safety.,
Find a team!,
Roles.,
If you made the team, congrats!,
In the end.",How to Be a Cheerleader (Youth)," Many think it is just something the popular, pretty girls do. This is NOT true. Yes, it can make you popular, due to exposure to the social scene but it is a hard sport! You need to be strong, flexible, and have a good attitude.;
, It takes a while to become a good cheerleader. Before even trying out or looking for a squad or team, you have to get in shape. Being fit is HUGE. There are definitely larger cheerleaders- it`s not about being skinny! But you need to be strong and healthy, so exercise every second day (cheer is an exercise itself), and try to eat well limiting yourself to a small treat a week. Please do NOT eat less or starve yourself. It makes you frail, weak, and diminishes all your energy, not making for a good cheerleader. The ones you see that are skinny is due to exercise and a good diet.

, This comes in TIME. Most are not flexible right from the start. Being in gymnastics is a great stepping stone. Try to get a little farther in the splits and leg lifts (forward) a lot but don`t push your limits or you could get injured. ESPECIALLY stretch after a bath, shower, or hot tub, massage, sauna, etc.

, Try to do tuck jumps a lot, they are easy, fun, a workout, and improve your jumps a lot. Do toe-touches. this is where you jump and your legs go to the sides. Can't touch them in the air? Fine! A lot of us can`t, including me! Just try your best.

, My cheer coach`s number one rule is NO PRACTICING STUNTS without a supervisor, with proper surroundings or you can get hurt. Jumps, rolls, and dances are fine to practice on your own time.

, Decide what you're into- school (cheering for sports) or competitive cheerleading (an out of school team that goes to competitions). If your school has a squad, that is a good place to start, to see if you like it. If you're not good at first, that is NORMAL!! You will get discouraged, but you improve very quickly, so do not give up!

, Even, if you have a role in mind (flyer, base, back, etc.) it is up to the coach to determine where you'd be best. Don`t be afraid to tell the coach what you have in mind, but respect their decision no matter what.

, If not, oh well. You gave it your best shot. DON'T GIVE UP!! Practice and practice and try again! You'll make it eventually! YOU WILL NEVER get ANYWHERE by giving up in life.

, So, your on the squad, have a uniform, how do you feel? Happy, excited, nervous? Cheerleading is a great way to make friends. Make conversation, complement a team member, or just exude confidence! (NOT cockiness!) If you find out you actually DON'T like cheer, tell the coach right away.

Wash your face with a good facial cleanser made for your skin type.,
Apply foundation using a foundation brush.,
Apply concealer under your eyes.,
Put your powder onto the brush, then tap off the excess onto the palm of your hand.,
Use a bronzer to contour your face.,
Use a shimmer eye shadow that is the same or a similar color to your skin tone first.,
Apply eyeliner.,
Apply your mascara in long, fluid strokes that cover your entire lashes.,
Apply a gold eye shadow to the center of your lip and pink lip gloss over your lips.

",How to Apply Makeup for Cheerleading," Rinse with cold water. Apply a matching moisturizer and wait for 5 minutes so the moisturizer can sink in. If you don't know what your skin type is, wash with an acne moisturizer and use oil free lotion.;
, Dot some on your forehead, cheeks, chin, and nose. Blend the dots outwards.

, If you have any blemishes (spots, insect bites, etc.) apply concealer directly onto the blemish, then dab with your finger until it fades into your skin. Do not rub, as this causes a ring around the blemish making it more obvious.

, Gently brush your face for an even application, but use a little more if a particular area is shiny.

, Apply it under your cheekbones and on your temples. Use a little down the sides of your nose. Avoid shimmery bronzer if you do not know how to apply it and blend it into your skin so that it matches your skin tone well.

, Then use white or cream to highlight the tear duct and your brow bone. You can also use a darker color, like dark brown, to accentuate your crease, which is the gap between your lid and brow bone, and your lash line.

, It is best to use gel eyeliner because it is easy to apply, and also does not smudge if you sweat. Choose one that is black, black-brown, or your team colors. Apply it only on the lash line.

, Make sure to use waterproof mascara in black or black-brown.

Stretch!,
Improve your basics!,
Improve your jumps.,
Take tumbling.,
Work on your arm motions.,
Work out every day!,
Buy equipment to practice at home (don't do anything too dangerous, though).",How to Be a Better Cheerleader1," Whatever stretches your coach has you do at the beginning of practice, do at home 1-2 times per day (splits, etc..) If you are a flyer, stretch your scorpion and heel stretch/bow and arrow. Over time, you will see a huge improvement!;
, Handstands, bridges, back handsprings, and back bends will help you with more difficult tumbling. It's true!


Learn how to fall the right way. Believe it or not, there is a right way of falling! If you're falling backwards, don't just freak out or twist; just do a safety roll, which is just almost doing a backwards roll, but not rolling and just stopping with your hands above your head. If you're falling forwards, tuck your chin in, extend your arms above your head, and roll.







, Remember to keep tight and squeeze your body the entire time. If you're sloppy, you can get hurt. A good way to improve your jumps is to practice the position of the jump you want to become better at when you're just sitting down watching TV or on the computer.


For further improvement, buy a pair of ankle weights (about 1 to 2 pounds each is good). While wearing them, do ""leg lifts"" - sit in a straddle, put your hands in front of you, and lift your right leg 10 times without letting it touch the ground in between each lift. Do the same with your left leg, and then with both legs at the same time. It's important that you keep your hands in front of you and don't let your legs touch the ground in between each lift. Do this every day and your jumps will be much better!







, Tumbling is extremely beneficial to an aspiring cheerleader. A couple of benefits of tumbling are learning how to have better tumbling passes, helping with jumps, and needed exercise.

, When cheering, your motions should be sharp, not wild and uncontrolled. Shoot your arm motions, and make sure your arms aren't sloppy. Squeeze your arms at all times.

, Being strong will help your tumbling, jumps, stunts, and everything else.


Practice makes permanent, so even when you practice, fix every possible mistake.

, If you're working on back handsprings, barrels will really help.

Just be yourself.,
Dress in athletic/sporty clothes,preferably your school colors!,
Do cheerleader makeup.,
Have the attitude.,
Be confident.,
Cheerleaders are always fit, whatever size that means for you.,
Stay in shape.,
Learn some cool tricks.,
Once you really start feeling like a real cheerleader, why not become one?",How to Act Like a Cheerleader," Even when someone has said something really sarcastic or cruel just smile happily and walk on! Be nice to everyone at school and always have a positive attitude, people will be nice to you if you are nice to them! Act bubbly, flirty, and outgoing! Be a party in a package.;
, In the movies, cheerleaders are mean/popular girls who are out to kill, but you don't have to be one! Be nice and don't make fun of anyone. Everyone is just as good as you! Cheerleaders and sports players are usually popular, and you may be too.

, Wear bright colors, like yellow, green, blue, pink, white, and orange. Wear dark-wash shorts 3 days a week and skinny jeans 2 days a week. Paint your nails in school colors with crackle on top. Wear your hair up in a bun with a bow, a ponytail with a bow, or a braid with a bow.

, Put on concealer, blush, lip gloss, mascara, eyeshadow, etc. Make sure it looks natural, yet gorgeous. For an extra blast, add glitter.

, Look back at step 2, don't be mean but you do have to have a little bit of attitude and swagger. Be super nice and friendly, but have a tough side. You can show off a little, but don't try to be better than everyone else.

, Have high self-esteem. Cheerleaders are confident and are not scared to show who they really are. Stand up to people and practice not being shy. Life's what you make it!

, Eat healthily and don't stuff yourself with carbohydrates and sugar, but do not starve yourself to be super-thin! If you're not your healthiest -- whether that be too big or too skinny -- you won't be able to be as active as you need to be! Eat a well rounded diet of fruits, veggies, and protein.

, If you need to have an exercise routine make one. Be sure to include cheerleading drills. Try to be an awesome cheerleader, so practice high jumping, stretching, tumbling, and dancing. Practice jazz and hip hop.

, You can teach yourself cartwheels and round-offs, but if you want to learn harder tricks, start taking tumbling lessons. Learn cheerleading jumps and stunts. Be able to do splits.

, Find out who the local/school team is. Don't care about what other people think about your decision, just follow your heart and go for it!!

Never, ever give up!

,
If you want to work on one specific skill, take private lessons.

,
Try your best, even at your practice.,
Be kind.,
Befriend a former cheerleader.",How to Be a Better Cheerleader2," If you don't take yourself seriously and look like a mess, why should other people take you seriously? Wear clothes that fit you, not ones that are too tight or too baggy. The best choice for cheer clothes are soft shorts and a T-shirt or tank top.


Wear your hair up - ponytails are ideal. Not only does it look pretty, but it also keeps the hair out of your face while cheering.
Never wear jewelry! It can get caught, snagged or ripped, and that hurts.

, Don't be afraid to yell! However, don't start screaming. You will stand out to the coach if they can hear you over everyone else. Remember to shout loudly and say the words clearly.

, If you don't make it the first time, keep practicing and trying. If you do make it, then don't think, ""Gee, I'm the best."" Obviously you have skill if you've made the team, but no one (including the coaches) will want to deal with that kind of attitude, and it can affect you next tryout season.

, Always have a positive attitude! Always believe in yourself. If you believe in yourself, you will succeed!

,,,, You perform what you practice, and if you practice not trying, or saying it's too hard, you won't perform as well. As as long as you can say ""I gave 100%,"" your coach will be happy.

, This step is another important one. When you watch movies, you may see cheerleaders being stuck up and rude but in reality, that's not how a cheerleader should be. If you're an awesome cheerleader, you will have respect for yourself and others. Don't pick on the new guy or people lower than you. That`s not cool even though your friends do it. A cheerleader is nice to everyone, and being nice means being nice to your team members too

Ask questions, ask your coach for things they are looking for also ask for previous routines and tapes.

, Ask someone who's been on the team in previous years, preferably Varsity cheerleaders with more experience."

Understand how to use light resistance.,
Determine the amount or resistance by the band's color.,
Adjust your band's position to make the workout easier or harder.,
Use slow, controlled movements for perfect form.,
Work on high-rep, low intensity sets.,
Learn to tie a basic anchor knot.",How to Use Resistance Bands1," One of the reasons resistance bands are popular is that they add resistance to a workout without drastically increasing the risk of injury like free weights and weight machines. Resistance bands work just like weights, except instead of gravity pulling down on your muscles you are fighting the tension in the band. Resistance bands allow you to create tension from any direction as opposed to just down, letting you work out every muscle in multiple ways.


Resistance workouts are great when you can't get to the gym, have joint pain, or want to vary your normal workout routine.Tube bands look like rubber jump ropes and have handles on the end for added convenience.
Basic bands are long, rectangular rubber bands that don't have handles and must be tied or gripped to work.;
, Most resistance bands have easy color coding to help users develop a workout. Usually, the fitness regimen includes starting with a medium resistance band and working up. Though not a perfect system, darker colored bands generally have higher resistance.



Light Resistance: Offer 3-6 pounds of resistance.

Medium Resistance: Offer 8-10 pounds of resistance. This is a good starting resistance.

Heavy Resistance: Offer 10-15 pounds of resistance.

Extra-heavy Resistance: Offer 16 or more pounds of resistance., The more of the band you have exposed the easier the exercise will be. This is because the band has more room to stretch. The bands provide the most resistance when they can barely stretch anymore, much like a rubber band is harder to pull on the tighter it is stretched. There are several ways to make bands more effective if they feel too easy:


Wrap the bands around your hands several times to shorten them and increase resistance.
Step on some of the band or wrap it around your foot before grabbing the ends.
Move further away from the band's anchor (what the band is tied or attached to).

, You never want to rush or push through an exercise to get it done. Your body should move slowly and fluidly, without rapid or jerking motions. After each rep, return to resting position calmly -- a controlled return is just as important as the initial movement for building muscle.Focus on good technique over more resistance. Strong form will help you gain muscle much faster than trying to push through harder weight.

, You want to aim for a lot of reps with resistance bands, since the weight is often not as difficult as going to the gym. Shoot for 12-20 reps of each exercises, and do 3 sets of each workout. You want to be straining to complete the last 2-3 reps each time, but not so much that you can't finish.


No pain, no gain is a myth. If you feel sharp pain or joint problems, stop exercising and see a sports medicine professional immediately., Many exercises require that you fasten the band to an anchor, allowing you to pull against this for resistance. Frequently, you can use a pole, skinny tree, or doorknob to hold on end of the band in place while you work out. You need to make sure that the anchor can hold your weight and that the knot is strong in order to prevent injury.


Pull on the band with increasing pressure before starting your exercise.
Make sure that the anchor does not move when you pull on it.
Increase tension by shortening up the band before trying to put more pressure on your anchor knot. Tie the band around your feet or hands to increase resistance."

Grip the cricket bat properly.,
Assume the proper stance.,
Shift your weight to your back foot for longer pitches.,
Shift your weight to the foot closest to the bowler for a full pitch (one that bounces close to you).,
Try to hit the ball before it spins.,
Swing the bat properly.,
Decide whether to attempt to score a run or continue batting.,
Select the right cricket bat.,
Prepare the cricket bat by having it knocked in.",How to Bat in Cricket," If you're right-handed, place your left hand on top of the handle towards the toe (the rounded tip of the cricket bat) with the right hand under it; left-handers place their hands the opposite way. The thumbs and forefingers should form a ""V"" between the outside edge and center of the bat that points towards the toe of the bat.


Batting gloves should be worn to protect your fingers if they get hit by the ball.;
, If you're right-handed, stand sideways in the crease (the ""safe"" area in front of the wicket) with your left shoulder towards the bowler (who ""pitches"" the ball); left-handed batters do the opposite. Look straight over your shoulder towards the bowler; do not tilt your head. Spread your feet about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart and bend your knees slightly with your weight distributed evenly on both legs. Rest the toe of the bat on the ground behind your feet near the wicket; your top hand will rest on the inside of the thigh nearest the bowler.

, Shifting your weight away from the bowler enables you to adjust to a ball that bounces higher off of the pitch and takes longer to reach you.








, Move to meet the ball.








, If the bowler is bowling spin, you can advance forward and hit the ball before it spins. You can play a front foot shot for a spin bowler; this gives you the advantage of a full-toss delivery and the chance to face the ball before it bounces and spins.








, When the ball is pitched, roll the shoulder facing the bowler down slightly and swing the bat backwards in a straight line. Use your top hand for control as you bring the bat forward to meet the ball.









The back-swing provides the power for the shot; a good swing clears the top of the wicket.

, A successful batsman knows when to try to score and when to remain in position and defend the wicket. If there is no time to switch places with the non-striker and score a run, stay put and prepare for the next shot.








, Bats differ in length, weight, and handle type; the right bat for you depends partly on your height and partly on personal preference.There are different bats depending on the type of ball you are using









The proper length depends upon your height. Get into your batting stance and hold the cricket bat next to your front leg. The top of the cricket bat should be situated just at the top of the players pelvis (The top of your hip).
The proper weight depends upon personal preference. Heavier bats provide more power, but lighter bats provide a faster swing. Take practice swings with cricket bats of different weights until one feels comfortable and controllable.
The proper handle depends upon personal preference. Bats with oval handles are stronger, but round handles are easier to grip, especially with your bottom hand. Round handles also provide additional lift when you hit the ball.

, Bats are made from willow, a soft wood that is initially hardened by a mechanical press. Additional hardening improves its performance and protects against cracking. While you can knock a bat in yourself, it is recommended that the process of strengthening the surface by denting and leveling it out be done by a professional.









Rub 1 tsp. (5 g) of raw linseed oil on the bat, coating the surface evenly to promote elasticity and protect against cracking. Apply the oil either with your fingers or a cloth, using a clean cloth each time (the oil is combustible, so dispose of the cloths immediately). Let the oil soak in overnight, then oil the bat 2 additional times before beginning the actual knocking in process.
Dent the middle of the cricket bat. Use a hardwood bat mallet designed for this purpose (a cricket ball may also be used). Continue hitting the surface until it is level and the dent has disappeared. This will take about 10 minutes using a bat mallet, and about 10 to 15 sessions are needed to complete the process.

Treat everyone nicely.",How to Act at Cheerleading Tryouts2," Even if you mess up, your smile shouldn't be altered. Act as if you trust yourself to do all routines correctly.

, Cheerleaders are all about being happy and rooting for the team,even when they aren't winning. Act like this!

, Even if you are positive you will make it, be friendly and helpful to those who might not make it. If you treat them any differently, judges will most likely notice.

"
If you make it, you have the right to be happy and excited.,
Be empathetic.,
If you don't make it, try not to cry.,
DO NOT be mean to those who make it or act any differently around them if you don't make it.

If you do make it, try to hang out with both friends who did and friends who didn't make it.",How to Act at Cheerleading Tryouts3," However, don't jump up and down around your friends who didn't make it and explain how excited you are.

, If a friend doesn't make it, you should understand and try to comfort them. And, if your friend doesn't make it,you guys could go out for ice cream to celebrate getting through tryouts (could also do this before results are posted).

, You could always tryout for a different sport! Crying shows others how much you expected to make it, and how you can't believe you didn't. And if you try out next year, they are going to remember that you cried, which will make them think you are not right for the team. It is okay to show you are sad or disappointed, though.

,, This shows that even if you made it or not, you still plan on keeping all your friends.

Do shoulder presses to improve your upper shoulders.,
Do tricep curls to improve your upper arms.,
Do standing rows to work on your back muscles.,

With an underhand grip on the band’s handles (so that your palm is facing upwards), alternate pulling each hand up towards your shoulder to do bicep curls. You should only bend at the elbow. Repeat 15-20 times with each arm.


Adventurous exercisers can combine this with a standing lunge to work on their lower body simultaneously., Stand with feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes out. Wrap the band around a post or tree behind you. Extend your arms to the sides, slightly curved, while holding the band just below of the handles. Keeping your elbows bent, bring your hands together in front of your chest. There will be a space between you and your hands as if you were giving someone a hug. Repeat 15-20 times.


The further away from the ends that you hold the bands the harder this will be.
Keep your arms straight and push out away from your body for a modified standing bench press., Stand on the center of the band with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the ends of the band with your arms by your sides. Keeping your arms straight, raise your arms perpendicular to your body until they are sticking straight out to the side like you are making a mock airplane. Slowly return your arms to your sides and repeat 15-20 times.

, Stand on the center of the band with your feet together. Hold the ends of the band in your hands, palms up at roughly nipple height. Push your hands straight up to the sky as if you were surrendering. Slowly return them to chest height and repeat 12-15 times.


Keep your back straight and your palms up as you exercise.

, Stand with your feet together on one end of the band. Pull the other band up along your spine (behind your back) so that the end is roughly even with the back of your neck. Grip the end of the band with both hands behind your head and your elbows up high, above you head. Bending only at the elbow, pull your hands up and above your head. Repeat 15-20 times.


The further up you stand on the band the greater the resistance, making the exercise harder.

, Wrap the middle of the band around a tree or pole and hold both ends with your hands straight out in front of you. The band should be roughly chest height. Bend your knees, feet on the ground, and keep your back straight. With your palms facing inward, pull the band back to your chest as if you were rowing a boat. Slowly return your hands to the starting position and repeat for 15-20 reps.The further away from the tree the harder this exercise will be., Rest on your knees and shins with your back straight. Wrap the center of the band around a pole or tree slightly above your head. Gripping the band with both hands in a few inches in front of your chest, bend towards the floor. When you are at a 90-degree angle (forming an L), slowly return to your starting position.


Keep your back straight.
You want to bend from your waist, not your spine."

Try side-stepping exercises.",How to Use Resistance Bands3," Stand on the center of the band with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width. Hold a handle or end in each hand, with your hands in front of and above your shoulders, as if you were about to give someone a boost. To do a squat, lower your butt as if you're about to sit down. Keep your back straight and focus on keeping your knees right over your toes. Repeat for 8-12 reps.If the band is too long, cross the band over your chest and hold onto opposite ends of the band, making an ""X"" across your pecs.

, Sit on a chair or bench, preferably with your back on a slight incline like you were in a pool chair. Hold the band in both hands, wrapped around your wrist. Bend your knee back towards your chest and put your foot on the middle of the band. You should feel resistance trying to keep your knee towards your chest. Extend the knee until it straightens out in front of you. Slowly return to starting position and repeat for 8 to 12 reps before switching legs


If it is too easy, wrap more of the resistance band around your hands to increase the difficulty.

, Lie belly down and loop a band around your right ankle, anchoring the other end to a door or support (you can wrap it around the opposite side of a doorknob and close the door. You should be facing away from the band, far enough away from the other end that you feel tension. Tighten your core. Then, bend your leg at the knee. You want to bring your heel toward your butt, going as far as you can comfortably go. Slowly return your leg to starting position and repeat for 10-15 reps, then switch sides.

, Tie a band around your legs, cinching it above both your knees. Lying on your back, bend your knees to 90 degrees. Your feet should be on the floor. Rise up from the floor with your hips until your shoulders, hips and knees align. You should focus on contracting your butt muscles through the entire movement. Do 15 to 20 reps.


Hold the stretch slightly at the top before slowly returning to the floor., Anchor one end of the band at ankle height on your left side by wrapping it around a post or wedging it underneath a heavy object. Wrap the other end around your right ankle. Stand in a wide athletic stance perpendicular to the band and step away the anchor to create tension. Slide your right ankle across your body, past your left leg, while squeezing your thighs together. Return to starting position slowly, then repeat for 12 to 15 reps. When you're done, switch sides.


Focus on keeping your leg straight as you work.
Try this in reverse too, ""pushing"" your right ankle out away from your body with your leg straight.

, Tie the band around both ankles so that you have to resist pulling them together. Get in a strong, athletic stance with your back straight and your knees bent. Walk sideways for 10 steps in each direction, focusing on pushing your outside leg way out and slowly following with the other foot.You may need to tie the band around the middle to create enough tension.

Eat a healthy diet.,
Build your endurance.,
Be flexible.,
Weight train.,
Develop a strong voice.,
Be careful not to overtrain.,
Make friends with the squad.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Develop confidence.,
Be energetic.,
Do some research.,
Practice leading up to auditions.,
Come to the audition prepared.,
Do not get discouraged if you do not make the squad.",How to Be a Cheerleader," This will make sure your body has enough energy and strength to train. Cheerleading is a very physical sport that requires a lot of endurance. Therefore, a diet high in carbohydrates, protein, fruits, and vegetables is important.Make sure each meal contains healthy, complex carbohydrates. Your body needs carbs for energy, so eat things like oatmeal, brown rice, whole wheat bread, and other nutrient-rich carbs.
Get some fruits and vegetables in with every meal. Have a side salad with lunch. Add some fruit to your morning cereal. Snack on assorted vegetables or fruits between meals.
Go for lean sources of protein like low-fat dairy, poultry, and fish.
A lot of people think cheerleaders do not eat a lot. This is not the case. If you're going to be working out in preparing for tryouts, a lot of healthy food is necessary for energy. Do not try to restrict your diet too much.;
, Cheerleading requires a lot of endurance, as you'll be moving and cheering throughout each game. Focus on physical activities that strengthen endurance.Running or biking can help build endurance. If you have a gym membership, or if there is a gym at your school, try riding the elliptical machine, a stationary bike, a treadmill, or the stair master.
Strive to keep your heart rate up throughout the workout. Push yourself a little more each week to add length to your workout.
Remember, start slow. If you haven't worked out in awhile, you may want to stick to 15 or 20 minute sets and build up from there.

, There will be a lot of bends, kicks, and stretches during your cheers. Therefore, flexibility is key. Engage in activities that help build your flexibility if you want to become a cheerleader.Yoga is a great way to build flexibility. You can take a yoga class at a gym, community center, or your school. You can also find yoga routines online.
In addition to helping you be a better cheerleader, flexibility will help prevent injury during training. Your muscles will be more bendable overall.

, Cheerleaders need to be strong. You'll be working long hours at practice and during games. Also, there may be cheers where you're required to lift another player. Incorporate weight training into your regular fitness regimen.Aim to weight train 2 to 3 times a week. Make sure not to weight train two days in a row, as this can cause strain.
You can use weights or a weight machine at the gym. You can also do things like push ups, sit ups, and Pilates, which use your own body as a weight.
If you do make the team, you will probably need to cut back on weight training during cheer season. You'll be doing a lot of weight training just during practice, and too much weight training can cause injury.

, You will need to be able to belt out cheers during games. Therefore, you should train your voice in addition to your body.Breathe correctly. Your breathing affects how your voice sounds. Do not take shallow breaths. Take big, deep breaths that fill your lungs with as much air as possible.
Use energy when you speak. You want to sound enthusiastic. Make sure you're using your cheek muscles as you talk, as this will affect how your voice comes out.
When you speak, pull away the muscles inside your throat the same way you do when you yawn. This will cause your voice to sound bigger, without sounding loud or shrill.

, You should always talk to a doctor before beginning a new training regimen. Over training can cause strain or injury. While you should work hard to become a cheerleader, do not do anything that could cause physical harm.Watch for signs of overtraining. You may feel a sense of heaviness, ongoing soreness in your muscles, lack of appetite, decreased concentration, and tiredness throughout the day. You may also feel an increased desire to skip workouts, as your body is warning you you're overdoing it.
If you've been overtraining, talk to your doctor about what you should be doing differently. You should also take a few days off of training to let your body recover.

, This can help you get a sense of the culture of your school's squad. Every squad is different, and oftentimes members want to choose new cheerleaders who will fit in with the group. Try to strike up a conversation with members of the squad to get a feel for the group.If you have class with a member of the cheer squad, try talking to her before the bell rings. If you can choose your own seat, try sitting next to her in class so you can chat.
Ask to sit with the cheer squad at lunch. While you may feel awkward doing so, remember that the worst thing that can happen is they'll say no.

, Cheerleaders are supposed to build up morale, so being positive is vital. Work on developing a positive mentality, as this will help you bring out enthusiasm in those around you.Be kind to yourself. Do not say anything to yourself that you would not say to someone else. Check yourself throughout the day to make sure you're staying confident.
If you screw up on a test, you may think, ""You're so stupid. I can't believe you did that."" Stop and correct yourself. Instead, think, ""Everyone makes mistakes. I'll do better next time.""
Surround yourself with people who are positive. Stay close to friends and family members who are encouraging of others. Try to be equally kind and enthusiastic in return.

, Confidence is contagious. Part of a cheerleader's job is to keep the team and crowd excited about victory. You should work on building up your own confidence to increase your chance of getting on the team.Work on your overall wellbeing. This will make you feel better about yourself. For example, do not watch TV all night. Instead, work on activities that make you feel good. Get your homework done, go out with friends, or work on a hobby.
Set goals and pursue them. This will also help bolster your confidence. For example, say you want to finish a book you're reading. Set out to read a certain number of pages each day.

, Cheerleaders need to be high energy to get everyone in the stadium excited. Work on building your energy in preparation for tryouts.


Laugh throughout the day. This can raise your heart rate, blood pressure, and mood. Watch a funny video clip online. Watch a movie you like. Hang out with a friend who makes you laugh.
Stretch throughout the day when you're feeling sluggish. A good stretch can help increase your energy and mood.
Make sure to get adequate sleep each night. A regular sleep schedule can help improve your overall energy.

, You want to know what the expectations are for the cheer squad. Prior to your audition, try to get a sense of what kind of cheers the team does.Ask other people who have auditioned. Every squad has different expectations regarding how to audition. Some squads may disapprove of you bringing in a spirit poster, while others may encourage it. You may be expected to wear school colors for some schools, while other schools may simply require you wear comfortable clothing that allows you to move around.
Talk to the coach or the head cheerleader. Ask him or her for tips on how to audition.
Go to some games. Try to memorize some of the cheers and moves. Make sure you're able to keep up with the team.

, A lot of quality practice time can help you shine. You may get nervous during auditions. You're less likely to slip up if you've practiced to the point you have a solid routine committed to memory.Make time to practice every day. Schedule time in your day to day schedule for practice. You could, for example, practice for an hour after dinner each night.
If you have friends auditioning as well, ask them to practice with you. You guys can help keep each other on track.

, Make sure you have everything that's required. You may need a permission slip, for example. Ask beforehand what materials you need, and make sure to bring them with you to the audition. You do not want to look underprepared.Relax and do your best when you're auditioning. Remember, cheerleaders are supposed to make the game fun for everyone. If you're having fun, you're more likely to look like cheerleader material.

, You can always try out again next year. Many people have faced rejection at some point in life, so take this as an opportunity to try harder next time. It's not necessarily a personal reflection of you. There were probably a lot of talented people trying out that year.


You can always get involved with the cheer squad in some other way. You can volunteer to help out with coaching, for example, or for a position like team manager.

In your gymnastics class, learn handsprings, tucks, aerials, and other difficult tricks.;
, It is better to take a gymnastics class, as this builds strength for cheerleading, flexibility, and tumbling skills. But, you can just take a tumbling class if you aren't into gymnastics.

, If you are on your school's cheer team, aim to become the cheerleader captain. You need to be a wonderful cheerleader, the best in your team, even if you aren't the captain.

, If there are none around, wait until you're older and join a college division team (level 6 all-star cheer). All you need to do is be part of a cheerleading squad in middle and high school and join an All Star team if you can.

, You need to have an extremely hyper-extended toe touch, a high pike, a strong herkie, around the world, tuck, double hook, hurdler, and spread eagle. You need to be on top of all of your jumps so they are strong, hyper-extended, and high. To make them strong, build leg muscle with squat jumps, squats, and straddle leg lifts. This also makes them higher. To hyper-extend them, you need an excellent over-split, have your head flat on your knees when in a pike, and just be extremely flexible. Don't forget a strong core! Practice your kicks too. You need to have perfect kicks with straight legs and pointed toes. Your motions should be stronger than anything, snappy, straight, and strong.

, In order to be a pro cheerleader, you need to do classes, no matter what. You need to be in a jazz, hip hop, and modern dance class, a gymnastics class, a cheerleading squad, and do track. The dancing will improve your flexibility, motions, cheer, and dance technique. The gymnastics class will improve your jumps, flexibility, and tumbling technique, and track will improve your endurance and strength. Of course a professional cheerleader needs to be on a cheerleading squad. You need to be on your school cheer team and possibly an All Star team. If your school does competitive cheer, you are fine. Do these classes during the school year and do cheer, dance, and/or gymnastics camp during the summer. If you have stingy parents who refuse to sign you up for all these classes, you may just want to be on your school cheerleading squad and teach yourself easy gymnastics moves (cartwheels, walkovers, round offs, handstands, etc.) and hopefully learn tougher moves on your cheer squad. If you do a perfect walkover by yourself, you may be able to teach yourself a handspring, but only with a spotter.

, You need to do strength training 3 days a week, cardio 3 days a week, and stretching 3 times a day. For strength training, do one day arms, one day abs, and one day legs. For cardio, do one day dancing, one day running, and one day walking. Do stretches to aid your splits, tumbling, arms, back, and stomach. On the one day you don't have anything already occupied, do non stop cheering. Remember, this is in addition to your classes and cheer practices.

, Cheerleaders are not only fit, they are gorgeous too. In order to be a professional cheerleader, you need a pretty face, a curvy body, and a tan, without counting other things. To make your face gorgeous, you should get into a skin care routine of washing, exfoliating, toning, applying an anti aging serum, and moisturizing twice a day everyday. For your body, do exercises for a bigger bottom like squats, lunges, wall sits, calve raises, leg raises, and kickbacks. For a small waist, do exercises like the hundred, crunches, sit ups, oblique crunches, bicycle crunches, and horizontal side supports. For perkier breasts, do push ups, tricep push ups, dive bombers, and side push ups. Also, massage your breasts daily. For your tan body, tan once a week in the sun and use a self-tanner daily. Other things to work on include white teeth, perfect hair, and neat makeup. So, go to your dentist and do everything they say. Whiten your teeth with baking soda, using a baking soda and water mixture to brush your teeth once a month. Start this at twelve. For perfect hair, use a good quality shampoo made for your hair type along with a matching conditioner. Also, use a heat protectant spray when styling and a deep moisturizing treatment once a week. For your makeup, wear lots of mascara on your natural lashes unless you wear fake lashes, in which you should wear only a little. Wear a pink lip gloss or lipstick, never fuchsia. Use a slightly shimmery eyeshadow, but not too shimmery. Glam it up but don't wear blue eyeshadow, red lipstick, or glitter. A nice pink, gold or brown eyeshadow is great, so is pink lipstick. Wear light foundation, powder, and concealer. Use a light blush too.

, Make sure you are a great leader, a happy person, bubbly, peppy, outgoing, and helpful!

Watch the ball as it approaches you.,
Decide what shot to play.,
Swing your bat straight and follow through with your swing.,
Remember that timing is more important than strength.,
Be straight and steady while playing.,
Concentrate on the ball and pick the line and length of the ball.,
Play your shot as late as possible.,
Move your head first and then your feet.,
Stay patient and keep calm.",How to Be a Good Batsman," If the ball comes wide, step across and leave the ball. It might be caught by a slip fielder or wicket keeper if you attempt to play a shot. Change your position as the ball approaches to make your work easier. You can use your front foot or back foot. Never try to be fancy.


Watch the bowler's hand and seam position.
Watch the ball from the hand adjust to swing or turn.
Learn to pick the shot from seeing these things.;
, Move your front foot forward and towards the ball as the ball approaches if you decide to play a shot and the ball is full. If the ball is short then move your back foot backwards and slightly away from you. Learn different front foot and back foot drives.If the bowl is pitched in good, full length take your front foot forward and play front foot shot and if the bowl seams to be short pitched play a backfoot stroke.


Play it as late as possible for fast balls or seamers.

, You can also play cross bat shots but these have a higher risk and require more practice.


Don't hold the bat too tightly; this causes shot lengths to decline considerably.

, Full strength and no timing will result in the ball traveling no more than 10 yards (9.1 m) while a properly timed shot with little power will fetch you more.

, Don't lose your balance while playing the shots. Keep a minimum distance between the wickets and your bat. This will minimize the chances of getting out.

, This will help you to hit better.


At times, the bowler may seem to change the pace and length of where they bowl. This may be beneficial for the bowler, but to be able to time one well, you will need to know where the ball will be pitched. If it seems to be a shorter delivery, you always have the option to play a pull shot, or to duck under the ball. If the ball seems to be pitched at a fuller length, you have the option to block, or go for a straight drive.

, Hitting the ball early will make it go up in the air and you will get caught.


Aim to play shots down on the ground.

, This stops your feet from planting and putting yourself in a bad position.

, You won't become a good batsman with just a few tries, as it takes a while to perfect your skills. Be positive while practicing and don't get frustrated if you get dismissed very quickly. When batting, practice focus and taking it all in your stride.

"
Use a ball 40 or more overs old.,
Keep the ball in good shape.,
Hold the ball along the seam.,
Bowl as you would a conventional swing, but with the sides of the ball reversed.",How to Add Swing to a Cricket Ball2," A new ball will swing naturally in a conventional direction, but at about this age, wear on ball changes its aerodynamics. It begins to swing in opposite direction of seam, towards the shine., Reverse swinging works best when the smooth side of the ball is very smooth, the rough side is very rough, and the seam is prominent.Continually polish the smooth side of the ball during play. Keep in mind, however, that scratching the rough side constitutes tampering, and is illegal.

, Grip it with your middle and index fingers on either side of the seam, with the ball resting on your thumb and third finger. The rough side should face the direction of the swing., This means the shiny side will now be facing away from the batsman. The difference between a conventional swing and a reverse swing is that in the former, the ball swings in the direction of the seam, while in the latter it swings in the opposite direction.To bowl an inswing, release the ball with the seam pointed at about a 20 degree angle towards the slip fielders.The last point of contact with the ball should be your middle finger.To bowl an outswing, release the ball with the seam pointed at about a 20 degree angle towards fine leg.The last point of contact with the ball should be your index finger.Bowl hard. The faster you are able to bowl, the more effectively you will be able to achieve a reverse swing. The speed necessary also depends on the state of the ball; the rougher the rough side of the ball is, the less speed you will need.

"
"
Use a ball with a prominent seam.,
Hold the ball along the seam.,
Bowl with the seam pointing straight down the pitch.",How to Add Swing to a Cricket Ball3," As with conventional and reverse swings, one side should be distinctly shiny, and the other side distinctly rough. Keep the ball as dry as possible., Grip it with your middle and index fingers on either side of the seam, with the ball resting on your thumb and third finger.

, The direction of the swing will be determined by the speed at which you throw.


At a low speed (under 70mph), the ball will swing toward the rough side.At a high speed (over 70mph), the ball will swing toward the smooth side.Note that the exact speed that determines the direction of the swing will vary based on the amount of wear on the ball."

Have the perfect grip.,
Get the flawless stance.,
Practice on your defensive batting.,
Learn to always play your shots through the ground.,
Take that single.,
Be patient.,
Have the right diet.,
Always play cricket in the right spirit.",How to Be a Better Batsman in Cricket,"


For a right-handed batsman, the left hand should be on the top of the handle and the right hand should be at the bottom, and vice versa.
Make a 'V' with the index finger and the thumb for both the hands.
The 'V' of the bottom hand should point straight down the center of the back of the bat.
The 'V' of the top hand should point straight down the middle of the center of the bat and the edge of the bat.
Your top hand should control the movements of your bat. This will allow you to hit every ball down the ground, limiting your chances of getting out caught.;
, This application of batting in cricket is the most varied in the international level. In spite of this variation, there is an orthodox approach to the batting stance.


Starting with your feet, they should be almost your shoulder-width apart.
Each of your feet should be on the either side of the batting crease.
Your feet should be in-line (in reference to each other) and parallel to the batting crease.
Your knees should be slightly bent. Your now have a solid base to execute your strokes.
Your head should always be in the center of your feet from side-on and over your toes from front-on.
Your bat should preferably be just less than half up for the back lift.
Your eyes should always be leveled as recent studies have found that a tilt head may result in late reaction time. So keeping your eyes level is a matter of prime importance.

, Now that you have got the basics perfect, you should now work on your defensive batting technique.


Learn the forward and the backward defense. This can prove to be very helpful in tough batting conditions or when a bowler is in his prime.

This can also help you spend time in the middle and assess the pitch.



,


This always is very productive because the majority of dismissals are caught out.
This can be achieved through playing as late as possible for straight-batted shots.
For cross-batted shots, you should always roll your wrists in the point of contact with the ball.

, Picking singles can help you to improve your scoring rate and it will help to keep the scoreboard ticking.


Always have the right judgement of a run. The best players in the world have a wonderful judge of a run.

, Always remember that you cannot be as good as Sachin Tendulkar over-night. This requires a lot of determination and hard-work, as far as perfection is concerned.

, Staying fit will improve your endurance and will improve your over-all performance.

, You can only enjoy the game when you are loyal to it.

Purchase some bat oil from a sports store or linseed oil from the hardware store.,
Coat the face of the bat with the oil.,
Lay the bat down, face upwards.,
Use a bat mallet (a cricket ball mounted on a handle).,
Take it to practice and use it for short fielding practice (use an old ball) a couple of times, then longer fielding practice.,
At the end of the season use 220 grit sandpaper, lightly sand the face, edges and heel to remove dirt, marks and most importantly any dried linseed oil off the bat and then re-coat once as previously described.,
Lightly sand again to remove any dried linseed oil and re-coat with linseed oil a couple of weeks prior to using the bat next season.",How to Oil and Break in a New Cricket Bat," They are exactly the same, but the hardware store is probably cheaper.;
, You can use a rag or your fingers. Do not put any oil within 25mm of the splice (where the handle joins the blade of the bat). Cover the edges and heel of the bat and about 40 mm in from the edges on the back of the bat. You want the oil on the face of the bat drawn into the face. This will not happen to the same extent if you coat the entire back of the bat and seal the wood. If you cover the entire back, you will end up with a dead bat compared to a well seasoned match ready one.

, Put some packing underneath the bat so it doesn’t tip to one side and allow the oil to drain off. Repeat the same process for at least 3 days. Check the amount of oil left on the face each day. If it has all been absorbed, give it another coat. Leave for 2 days laying flat. Wipe off any remaining oil after this time.

, Spend about half an hour or more a day for a week tapping the face and edges of the bat with the mallet. This will compress the wood on the face of the bat. Begin hitting relatively softly and increase each day. Make sure you cover the entire face evenly. Pay particular attention to the edges and near the edges on the back of the bat where you have oiled. This will make sure that the edges are less likely to be damaged when you first begin using the bat.

, Over the next couple of weeks use it in the nets (starting with an older ball and softer strokes).

, Leave flat overnight, wipe off any excess and store in a bat cover over the off season.

, You may need to give the bat more than one coat. Check the amount of oil left on the face the next day. If it has all been absorbed, give it another coat.

Practice.,
Focus on your weak points.,
Believe in yourself.,
Play a variety of shots and strokes.,
Set Goals.,
Guess bowling strategies.,
Become well-versed in the tricks.,
Watch matches played all the way out.,
Avoid being disappointed.,
Enjoy your game.",How to Improve Your Batting in Cricket1," Practice is very important in order to improve your batting. Make sure to practice regularly, even if it is for a short interval, even half an hour. The more you practice, better your play will be.


An unplanned practice session helps in nothing but tiredness. Keep everything preplanned to help you out while practice session.
You can get a coach to help you on improving your batting skills. But remember, no one can teach you anything before you put your own efforts in your game. ;
, You should know your weaknesses and strengths and try to bat as much as possible to turn them into a strength. It is always better to have no weak points instead of having a few strengths. Work on balls which you feel hard to face or part of the ground where you mostly get out., It is vital to believe that you can bat well. For this, you need to be passionate about cricket. Confidence comes with practice. The more you practice, better you will know about your game. Keep yourself motivated during games. Congratulate yourself on every single run.

, Don't stick to a particular shot. Different balls need to be angled differently. You can practice a shot to master it, but should not make the same response on every ball. If you play a particular shot on a couple of balls, the bowler may realize that it is your strong zone and would avoid you bowling there.

, Try to set your goals such as 'Scoring 25 runs; playing yorkers'. Through this, you will increase your potential and more accurately come to know your capability. Start from small targets and then increase your levels step by step.



Play unofficial games. Play some pick-up games among friends that involve batting, but not necessarily in a true game. This would help you to increase your enthusiasm for batting and improve your skills at the same time.
You will come to know about handling pressure and play under tense circumstances.

Know your role. Find out what team wants from you and what position do you play in. Sometimes your team expects very much from you, but you do not know what you have to do when you go in.

Interact with your teammates. Attend team meetings and discuss strategies. An effective communication will help your teammates play well as a unit.

, Guess what could be the next ball from the bowler. If you know the tricks and the bowling speed of the bowler, you can decide your shots and adjust your timing.


Nothing can be done once the ball is delivered. You have to guess right from the run-up.
Place yourself in the bowler's position. Guess what you would have done if you were at the other end. This will help you guess and respond accordingly.

, Learn different tricks like playing the hook shots and playing drives. Always try to play from the middle of the bat, called the sweet spot.

, Try to watch more and more matches and observe the strategies, then apply them in your own game.


Follow one of your favorite cricketers. Notice their style of playing and adapt those styles in your own game.

, If you can't achieve your goal, don't lose confidence. Every player has variations in capabilities and talent; some players don't achieve their goal even after many tries. The key is to not give up and keep practicing.

, Most importantly, you should love and enjoy the game. Play with a cool mind ;accept defeats and take them as a challenge and move on. Be fair and respect other players and your teammates, too. No one wants his/her team to lose the game.

Understand the off spin effect.,
Grip the ball.,
Position the fingers.,
Spin it.,
Release.,
Aim.,
Get ready to play.",How to Grip the Ball to Bowl Offspin1," An off-spin, or off break, delivery turns from the offside to the leg side when bowled at a right-handed batter, or from left to right as you look down the pitch. That means, it moves into a right-handed batsman and away from a left handed batsman.;
, The grip for spin bowling is very different from seam bowling.

Notice that the seam turns from vertical to horizontal in the grip.

, The middle joints of the index, middle finger and third finger are well spread across the seam. The little finger and thumb are not involved.

, With off spin, you are looking to rotate or spin the ball from your forefinger to your third finger

, The fingers rotate as the ball exits the hand.


This is almost like turning a doorknob as you release it from the front of your hand.

, You should aim to bowl the ball outside the off stump. If you bowl too close to the stumps, the batsman may dispatch your ball to the boundary on the leg side.

, Following the steps above, you should now be able to bowl off-spin and hopefully take some wickets.

Hold the bat the way you get a full powered swing.,
Take a strong Batting Stance.,
Get your feet moving while playing hard shots.,
Position your head.,
Finish your shot with a clean follow through.",How to Bat Aggressively," That is hold the bat either from the bottom of the handle (like Virender Sehwag) or from the top of the handle (like Adam Gilchrist) or anywhere so that you comfortably get a full outstretched swing of the bat.;
, For aggressive batting, your stance should be strong and composed. A high back lift stance helps in improving your batting reflexes and gives extra power to the shots played.

, If you move your feet towards the pitch of the ball you'll be able to transfer the weight of your back leg to the shot you'll play. This adds on as some extra power to your shots and also increases your chances of hitting the ball from the middle of the bat.

, Head should be in the right position while playing shots. With a steady head you'll have more control on your shots and you'll improve your shot selection and placement.

, A good shot follow through gives perfect lift to the ball and prevents you from injuries.

Improve your Grip.,
Work on your stance.,
Build you innings.,
Improve your Muscular Strength.,
Play some good knocks.",How to Improve Your Batting in Cricket2," It is a basic step, but very important for improving your batting. Different players have different grips, but usually a 'V' shaped grip is used. Bat is folded with palms and fingers crossing the bat. Bat can be hold from bottom or top but choose the style you like.


Usually, a bat is held near the bottom during the start of the innings. Once you are set in the middle overs, you can hold it from little above in the middle to play better and lofted shots.
The upper hand should be held tight while the lower hand a little loose, helping you to play drives.

, Different player have different stance. You can try various stances and look out for the most comfortable one. Take a guard over the middle wicket. Your weight must be balanced on the balls of yours feet and a foot inside the crease.


Your eyes and shoulders should be leveled; focusing on the ball or the hand of the bowler, better is focusing on the ball as it tricks.
Take guard, preferable middle guard and rest the toe of your bat exactly in the center.

, Spend time on the pitch and score singles or doubles on every delivery. Rotate the strike and give more opportunities to your partner if he/she is having a good game.

, The game of cricket requires a lot of muscular strength. You need to hit off those long sixes and for that you require a great arm strength. Do some hard work to get those big muscles.

, Once you have scored quite runs and have helped your team win at difficult stages, you will have a good time on field. Try to score big whenever you get opportunity. Failures are common, but you must not stop trying.

Be Psychologically prepared.,
Have your batting gear ready (have the right size bat, pads that fit , comfy shoes etc.),
Before the match, get a bowler to bowl to you.,
If the option is available, you may want to bat, fifth or sixth, so you'll be more likely to face spinners or medium pacers.

,
Once you are called up to bat, walk out with confidence and looking up towards the pitch.,
Take your stance after checking the fielders positions and setting up your own.

,
When the bowler runs in, keep your head still and focus on the ball (or the hand with the ball in it).

,
As he bowls, don't play too aggressively (unless the situation needs you to hit out or get out).

,
After he bowls, keep your head up, check the pitch for the hardness and get ready to face again, until your comfortable with playing an attacking shot.

,
Don't afraid if the ball swings or moves too much.",How to Bat Against Fast Bowlers," Cricket, like many other sports is highly reliant on mental attitudes. Being mentally ready includes: getting all your gear ready the night before, and waking up well rested, eating well, keeping yourself hydrated ,getting at least 8 hours of sleep and take sometime to prepare your mind for the game ...;
,

, Tell him/her to start off at a medium pace, then work his/her way up to a faster pace, until he is bowling as fast as (s)he can.

,, After saying 'well done' to the batsman who got out. Go over to your teammate and ask him how this bowler bowls.

Know the rules.,

Be attentive.",How to Catch a Cricket Ball1," For taking a catch you should be aware of the rules made by the International Cricket Council (the governing body over cricket):


The batsman is not declared out if the ball is a no-ball or dead ball.
The fielder drops the ball before completely catching the ball.
The fielder steps over the boundary line.
The ball bounces before the fielder collects it.;
, The fielder should be in a good position in order to catch the ball. An ideal stance would be bending your knees and making cup with your hands.


It is essential for a slip fielder to bend on knees and keep hands pointing down, making a cup position. This will assist you in taking a low catch.

, If you think you are a bad fielder, keep that thought out of your mind. Fielding depends on your attentiveness and your attitude towards game. Thinking in a positive way can help you become a better fielder.

, Attentiveness is required for a good catch. You should expect that every next ball will come to you. In this way, you will be more attentive and focused on the game.

Familiarize yourself with the rules of softball.,
Purchase a book on coaching softball.,
Attain certification if necessary.,
Put together a practice schedule.,
Meet the players and their parents.,
Assign each player to positions.,
Run specific drills at each practice.,
Make in-game changes calmly and between innings.,
Adjust your practice regimen as needed.",How to Coach Softball," The most basic foundation for coaching softball is understanding the rules of the game. If you have any questions about the rules, you can look them up online; the Amateur Softball Association (ASA) maintains the official set of rules used in the United States. You will also want to check with the local league office to determine if any rules are changed based on age group.;
, There are numerous books available on coaching youth softball, and these are your best resource for learning each aspect of coaching in depth. Some books provide a broad overview, while others offer drills and exercises to improve your team's performance. Set aside time to read at least 1 book on coaching from cover to cover, and keep it handy as a reference.

, Some softball leagues will require their coaches to be certified; an example of an organization that runs a certification program is the National Youth Sports Coaches Association (NYSCA). The certification will generally entail participating in a short clinic and passing an exam on coaching.

, If the practice times are not already defined, you will need to set times for them. Keep in mind when doing this that many players will have 2 working parents, and so practices should be scheduled to accommodate busy work schedules. Use emails to communicate the schedule to the parents. This will allow the parents to easily communicate about potential conflicts.

, At the first practice, or at a specific meet-and-greet event, take some time to get to know each player and their parents. Strive to make your coaching a personal rather than impersonal endeavor. The parents need to feel comfortable with you teaching their children, and the players will be more willing to work with you if you are personable and open.

, There are no hard-and-fast rules to help you determine which players should play which positions. General rules include playing your best fielders at third base and left field, and playing those with the most accurate throwing arm at pitcher. If you are having trouble assigning players to positions based on skill, ask them what positions they'd like to play. They may be more willing to put in effort at a position they really want to play.

, Drills are exercises designed to specifically improve a single aspect of your players' performance. Develop a regimen of softball drills using the book you purchased on coaching. Areas of interest include infield and outfield footwork, throwing and catching, base running, hitting, and bunting. Remember to start each practice with stretching and warm-ups.

, When something is not going well during a softball game, it can be tempting to address it immediately by yelling and getting the players' attention on the field. Avoid this, instead opting to give corrective suggestions between innings. This will keep your players relaxed, which often improves their playing as well as their attitude.

, There is no single perfect system for coaching softball; needs will change based on schedules, skill level, player attitudes, and other factors. Use game performances to diagnose weaknesses and strengths in your team. Address these areas during practices by creating new drills or emphasizing certain existing ones. Don't be afraid to implement drills that do not actually involve softball skills directly; team building and trust exercises can also be very useful.

Identify your fielding position.,
React quickly.,
Keep your eye on the ball.,
Make the cup.,
Practice the proper form.",How to Catch a Cricket Ball2," Be familiar with where you are standing, whether you are near the boundary or fielding in slip or gully. This will help in avoiding fallout with another player.


Don't rush over every ball that goes high. Make an effort only for those which are either over you or in no-man's land.


, You must react within seconds . If you receive a catch over your chest take a step or two back and catch the ball.

, It is essential for a fielder to keep eye contact with the ball. Keep your eyes on the ball until it passes you else it would result in a dropped catch.

, Make the cup with your hands and let the ball rest on your palm.

, Practice taking the catch over and over, whilst concentrating on using perfect form for each catch. Soon the catches will become second nature."
"
Keep your eye on the ball.,
Move to where the ball is going to go.,
Face the ball square.,
Bend your knees.,
Extend your arms forward.,
Place your ungloved hand against the side of your mitt.,
Be ready to throw.",How to Catch a Softball1," Hand eye coordination is the most important part of catching a softball. You must train yourself to always watch the ball that is coming toward you. Taking your eyes off the ball for a second can throw off your ability to catch it. Practice watching the ball as soon as it leaves the bat or the thrower’s hand., Move your whole body to where the ball is going, don’t just reach for it. Ideally you want to catch the ball directly in front of you rather than off to the side. Even though it can be scary at first to have the ball coming straight at you, this gives you the best chance of catching it. Having the ball off to the side increases the possibility of missing the catch., Once you have moved to where the ball is headed, position yourself directly in the line of the ball. Keeping the ball directly in front of you gives you the ability to move your glove around as needed in case the ball comes in higher or lower or off to either side of you., Although you have moved to where you think the ball is headed, you need to be able to quickly correct your positioning. Keep a good athletic stance with knees bent and most of your weight on the balls of your feet. This allows you to make quick movements should the ball end up in a different spot than you thought., With your mitt open, extend your arms out in front of you, keeping your elbows slightly bent. Just like bending your knees allows you to move, having your arms extended and slightly bent gives you the most mobility. Keep your arms at chest level as much as possible, and adjust them as the ball gets closer to you. Think of how you would position your arms if you were pushing against a wall. This is the position you want., Catching is not just about using your mitt. Your free hand is just as important because it is used to secure the ball once it hits your mitt. Place your thumb just behind the thumb inside your mitt, form a W shape with your hands. This will give your mitt extra stability and allow you to clamp your free hand over the ball once the ball is in your glove., Many times when you catch the ball you will need to throw it to another player immediately, so this is why your throwing hand should be close to the mitt. Once you clamp the ball, you can transfer it to your free hand quickly and make the throw.

"
"
Get under the ball.,
Hold your glove straight up.,
Open your mitt.,
Place your free hand at the side of mitt.,
Run forward for the catch.",How to Catch a Softball2," This is the fly ball equivalent to getting in front of the ball. Since the ball will be coming from up in the air down to you, you need to move the spot where you think the ball is going to land. Be patient for a few seconds until you have the spot in mind before you move to it. You want the ball to come down slightly in front of you and slightly toward to your throwing side., You will need to catch a fly ball over your head rather than at chest level, so once you have gotten to roughly the spot where you think the ball will land, raise your arm into the air. Point your fingers up to the sky and make sure the palm is slightly horizontal to give the ball a place to land. Keep your elbow slightly bent, and don’t lock it in place., This should be done as you raise your arm. You may not have much time between getting to the right spot, raising your arm, and making the catch, so be sure to keep your mitt hand loose while you run and open as you raise the arm.

, Just like in line drive catches, your ungloved hand is used to clench the ball in your glove and make sure you keep hold of the catch. Your hand should be touching the side of the glove when your arm is in the air. If you are going to need to throw the ball quickly, having this hand right by your glove will make the movement smoother.

, If you know a softball is coming from high up, you want to be patient until you have an idea where it is going to land. It is best to make the catch while moving forward rather than backward because you keep everything in your sight. So when positioning yourself, plan for the ball to land slightly in front of you and then move forward to get completely under it."

Lower your whole body.,
Touch the top of the mitt to the ground with your palm up.,
Place your ungloved hand on the bottom edge of your glove.,
Clench the ball.",How to Catch a Softball3," When the ball is rolling toward you along the ground, the most important thing is to bend your knees and get your body closer to the ground. You don’t want to simply bend at the waist and reach down. Lowering your body gives you more ability to adjust and it allows you to look around more than if you bend over., Although you usually catch the ball with your fingers up, ground balls require you to flip your mitt so your fingers point down. Rest the top of the mitt on the ground allowing it to act like a ramp that the ball will roll into., This is one of the most important parts of catching ground balls. Your ungloved hand acts as as stop for the ball. Without this placement, the ball could roll straight up your glove and hit you in the face or just be dropped. The bottom part of your hands should be touching each other., As the ball rolls into your mitt, quickly clamp your hand down on the ball and close your glove. If you perfect the rhythm of fielding ground balls, you can learn to let the ball roll up your glove directly into your throwing hand.

Choose mild dish soap to wash your bat.,
Use a brush to get rid of tougher stains.",How to Clean a Softball Bat1," Take a washcloth with mild soap (not hand soap!) and tap water. This is the most common way to clean a bat and, depending on the stubbornness of the stains, it can be very effective.Wipe your bat with a soft, clean cloth to brush away any loose dirt and grime. You could also use an old sock or a paper towel.
Mix dish soap into warm water to make it sudsy. Dip a clean cloth in the water and wring it out well to avoid dripping. You could also try using shampoo if you don't have dish soap.
Wipe the bat down with the cloth to clean it. Try not to get your gripping tape wet.;
, If you’ve tried using the warm water and washcloth, and stubborn stains remain, you’ll need to try something with bristles.


Work over a bathtub. Take a hard bristled brush, or at least a brush that's good for getting off a hard stain. Then with water running and soap at hand, just scrub.
You could try a toothbrush for smaller stains, but the bristles won’t be as strong. Be prepared that it could take some time.
Use a plastic or nylon scouring pad to clean stubborn areas that may need more attention. Rinse the bat under clean running water to remove residual soap.

Buy special bat cleaning liquids or cleaning pastes.,
Use polish on wooden bats.,
Try rubbing alcohol to remove ball marks.,
Try natural ingredients for cleaning your bat.",How to Clean a Softball Bat2," You can find these liquids and pastes at many sports goods stores. They are specially designed for cleaning bats. Just dip a wet paper towel into the cleaning paste or liquid before rubbing it on the bat.If the bat is relatively new, you may want to buy the liquid or paste - just to be on the safe side. Some bats can be fairly fragile with paint chips, so you will want to take all precautions while washing and handling them.
A magic eraseris another product that people use to clean bats. Just follow the instructions on the package and remember to dry it if it is a bit damp., If the bat is wooden, to give it a nice shiny finish, you can polish the bat with wood polish, such as orange glow.


The wood polish on a wooden bat is absorbed because it is softened when applied, but it still gives it a great finish. When applied to a metal bat, the oils just rest on the surface so try to limit how much you apply.
You also need to be careful when applying the polish to a wooden bat. If you polish the wood too much it could become soft and break.

, If soap and water or other chemicals are not doing the trick on their own, try rubbing alcohol.Dampen a small portion of a cloth with it and rub it on the bat. Drying is important when cleaning a bat if you want it to look brand new again.
First, lay the bat across your lap. Next, rub the wipe all over the bat. This should get the dirt off of it.
Goof Off works for anything sticky, such as Pine Tar. You might want to mix a small amount of bleach into the water. You could also soak in Windex/water solution (50/50) or try Clorox or Lysol wipes. You can buy these cleaning products in many grocery stores.
If your handle is made of leather, use shoe polisher to clean that. Once you clean the bat, make sure you dry it completely, as you don't want your bat to start rusting.

, You can apply natural products to clean your bat if you don’t want to be around harsh chemicals.


Some people apply olive oil to their bats before washing it off with water. Remove adhesive from your bat by dipping a clean cloth in olive oil and rubbing the adhesive away.
If you have too many marks on your bat, you can clean it with a scrub, warm water, and lemon juice. Or you could try using a vinegar/water solution (75/25) by spraying it all over the bat. Let it rest for about 30 seconds, and then lightly scrub it with a sponge and dry with paper towels.
If you have a wooden bat with natural wood, it's a better idea to use a fine grit sandpaper. Choose 200 grit or higher. Lightly sand down the marks from the ball. Move the sandpaper in the wood's grain direction. Avoid going over areas that are engraved."
"
Make sure to thoroughly dry the bat.,
Prevent your bat from getting so dirty in the first place.",How to Clean a Softball Bat3," It’s important to remember that cleaning a softball bat before tournaments or games is not ideal for the player.


The ball will slip easier off of the barrel of the bat which can cause foul balls, ground balls, and even pop flies.
In order to avoid such problems, it’s a good idea to make sure to let the bat dry for 36 hours before using it in any games or tournaments.

, The initial care before even attempting to clean your bat is very important.


Banging your bat against your cleats or using any ball other than a baseball/softball (such as the ones used in practice) can degrade the quality of your bat's finish which can in turn cause long-term problems.It is also best to turn the bat a few centimeters after every hit when playing a game as this ensures you are not constantly wearing down one part of the bat.
Try not to hit waterlogged balls, and don't use rubber cage balls. Avoid using fast-pitch softball bats in extreme heat, as they may dent more easily."

Keep your eyes on the ball.,
If you see it is coming your way, quickly call the ball by shouting ""Mine!"",
Get under the ball.,
Use two hands.",How to Catch Fly Balls in Softball," Otherwise, it will hit you in the head.;
, or ""I got it!"". This will help other players back off to avoid a collision.

, It is much easier to catch this way, rather than reaching for it.

, When the ball lands in your mitt, immediately cover it with your free hand. That traps the ball in your mitt, and prevents the ball from bouncing back out.

Choose a material for your bat.,
Determine what softball bat length fits your body.,
Determine the weight of your softball bat.,
Research the rules of your softball league.",How to Choose a Softball Bat," While most softball bats are lightweight and durable, there are differences to consider when choosing a bat material.


Pick an aluminum bat. Aluminum alloys are durable and thin. The light weight aluminum also increases the ""sweet spot"" of the hitting zone on barrel of the bat, which can help add distance to your hits.
Decide if you want a graphite/titanium lined bat. Graphite and titanium will help reduce vibration. The materials also will reduce the stinging sensation often experienced when the ball doesn't hit the sweet spot of the bat. (If you go to Kmart or any store that sells softball bats you can see that on some bats especially on Easton brand you can see where they marked ""extended sweet spot."");
,


Determine your bat length based on your age. Bat lengths generally come between 24 to 34 inches (61 to 86.4 cm). There are charts available online and at most sporting good stores for players 5 years and older.
Gauge your bat length by your height and weight. Check online for available charts and consult your local sporting good stores to determine the ideal bat for your height and weight.
Evaluate the distance to your wrist. Stand with your arms at your side and your feet together. A bat with the correct length standing on it's end should reach to your wrist.

,


Choose a bat weighing 29 ounces (822.14 g) or more if you're bigger and stronger than most softball players. You'll receive the benefits of both the heft of the bat and the power of your swing.
Pick a bat weighing 28 ounces (793.79 g) or less if you're a smaller player with less strength. Choosing a lighter bat will enable you to have more control of your swing and swing the bat quicker.

, Every softball league is different, so be sure to obtain a list of approved and/or banned bats before making a purchase.

Determine whether you need a fastpitch or slowpitch bat.,
Find out if your team has special size or material requirements.,
Find out about any other requirements or regulations.",How to Buy a Girl's Softball Bat1," The two common types of softball – slowpitch and fastpitch – require different types of bats. In general, slowpitch softball requires heavier bats, while fastpitch requires lighter bats. Before you select a bat, make sure you know which type of softball game it will be used for., Some softball teams or leagues require bats that conform to certain size restrictions or are composed of specific materials (e.g. wood vs. metal or composite). For example, the United States Specialty Sports Association (USSSA) requires that a slowpitch softball bat must be no more than 34 inches (86.36 cm) long, 2 and ¼ inches (5.72 cm) in diameter, and 31 oz. (0.88 kg) in weight. They also have requirements regarding the construction of the bat, e.g. that the knob on the end of the bat must be welded on or mechanically attached.Before purchasing a bat, consult the league or team handbook for equipment regulations, or ask the team’s coach.

, Some leagues or teams require that bats bear particular markings – for example, graphics indicating that the bat is approved by a particular sports association, or an indication of the BPF (bat performance factor). They may also require that the bat be decorated or colored in a particular way. Your team or league may also have regulations regarding the modification of bats (e.g. adding tape or a grip sleeve to the handle)."

Check your existing sports clothing brands first.,
You might want to browse gloves online first.,
Go to your local sporting goods store (Dicks, etc.),
Look through the selection available.,
Try it on!,
If you need help, find a knowledgeable assistant to take you through the stock, or someone who has played for a while who has gone through this process before and can give you tips based on their experience.

,
Unless it is second hand (in which case the next two steps don't apply), once you have bought your glove, your glove will be stiff because it has never been used, and you will have a hard time catching the softball.,
If breaking it in sounds like too much for you, don't worry.,
Start using your glove, and have fun!

",How to Buy Softball Gloves," It is possible you might be able to ""match"" if you have a favorite sports brand.;
, Although this might help you get a general idea on what type you want, but the store might not have the exact glove you want. Shopping online isn't the best though, because you can't try the glove out. This is the time you should also consider your budget: Softball gloves can be as much as $130!

, and go to the baseball/softball section. If you are not committed to softball and may not be playing for more than a year or so, you can try out some secondhand gloves as well. These gloves will be a lot cheaper. There is no difference!

, Unless you really find a baseball glove you just can't live without, you should stick to the softball gloves . It's better to buy a softball glove: the difference between a baseball glove and a softball glove is on a softball glove has longer fingers and a bigger pocket. A softball is a lot bigger than a baseball, so it's easier to catch with!

, When you find to right one you can tell its not to loose but not to tight either. One thing that can be helpful is that you can bring a wiffle/lacrosse ball and GENTLY try tossing it up and catching it.

,, If the season is starting soon, you may want to break it in quickly. You can have your glove steamed, or buy a glove conditioner. Using regular hair conditioner is not recommended. Follow the directions exactly if you will be doing so- if you don't do it correctly, you could ruin the glove.

, Your glove will naturally break in as time passes. Just be sure to keep a softball in the glove when you are not using it, as it will help the glove pocket form correctly.

Consult a softball bat size chart.,
Determine bat length range by using the girl's age.,
Narrow down the bat length based on the girl’s height and weight.,
Check the bat length by measuring it against the girl’s body.,
Determine the appropriate bat drop based on the girl’s age range.,
Determine the correct bat weight based on the girl’s personal preference.,
Choose the handle diameter according to the girl's preference.",How to Buy a Girl's Softball Bat2," This will give you a general idea of the size range you are looking for. Most sporting goods stores can provide sizing charts, which can help you determine the right length or weight range for a bat based on your child’s height, weight, and age., You can get a good ballpark estimate of how long your bat should be based on your child’s age. These estimates are based on the average height and weight of children in a particular age range, and so will only give you a range and not a specific length. For example, in fastpitch softball, a child 5 to 7 years old would use a 24- to 26-inch (61 to 66 cm) bat, 8 to 9 years old would use a 26- to 29-inch (66 to 74 cm), and so on. For each year older, add approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) to the bat length as a general rule.If the girl you are buying a bat for is exceptionally large or small for her age, you may need to select a bat outside of the expected size range for her age group.

, For example, if she weighs less than 60 lbs. (27.2 kg) and is 36-40 inches tall (91-102 cm), she should probably use a bat that is about 26 inches (66 cm) long., Once you have selected a bat that you feel is in the right length range, try several measurements to make sure the length is appropriate and comfortable.Have the girl extend one of her arms straight out to the side, at shoulder level. Place knob of the bat at the center of her chest and align the bat along her arm, with the end toward her fingertips. If she can comfortably touch the end of the bat with her fingertips, it is probably about the right length.
Place the knob of the bat in the center of her chest and hold the bat so it is extended straight out in front of her. Ask her to reach out and grab the barrel (widest part) of the bat. If she can do so comfortably, the bat is probably about the right length.
Stand the bat up vertically against her leg while she is standing up straight. A bat of the right length should come up to about mid-hip level.

, Softball bat weight is sometimes described in terms of “drop,” which is the difference between the bat’s length (in inches) and weight (in ounces). For example, a bat that is 33 inches (83.82 cm) long and weighs 23 ounces (0.65 kg) has a drop of -10. The smaller the drop number, the higher the bat’s weight relative to its length.In general, children under 10 will be most comfortable using bats with a drop of -13.5 to -10, while older children may be comfortable with a drop as small as -8.
If the girl is exceptionally small or large for her age, you may need to adjust the bat drop accordingly.

, The weight of the bat should ultimately be determined by what is comfortable for the girl and what her playing style is like. Longer, lighter bats will allow for faster hits, while shorter, heavier bats deliver more powerful hits.Ask the girl to hold the bat out in front of her with one hand and swing it back and forth. If she is unable to do so without dropping it, the bat is probably too heavy for her.
Consult your coach or a specialist at your sporting goods store if you have any concerns about selecting the right weight.

, All bats are tapered at the handle, but the diameter can vary. Some children prefer a smaller handle, especially if they have small hands. A smaller handle provides for a quicker wrist rotation when swinging the bat. However, a thicker handle can reduce the vibration or sting that comes from not hitting the ball in the correct area of the bat (""sweet spot""). Make sure the handle’s diameter and materials conform to your team’s requirements."

Consult your coach about the right type of bat to buy.,
Buy a wood bat for practice, tournaments, or professional games.,
Choose an alloy bat for lightness, durability, and affordability.,
Choose a composite or hybrid bat for good balance and high performance.,
Decide between a one-piece or a two-piece bat.,
Keep your budget in mind.",How to Buy a Girl's Softball Bat3," Different bat compositions and materials have different uses and advantages. It’s important to know what kind of bat is appropriate for the game the girl will be playing., Wood bats are generally heavier than other types on the market. They may be most appropriate for slowpitch softball and for professional games and tournaments.Some leagues mandate the use of wood bats for safety reasons, since balls hit with wood bats are less likely to attain speeds that can result in serious injury to defensive players and pitchers., Alloy bats (made from aluminum or other types of metal) are light and relatively inexpensive. They also have the advantage of being ready to use right away – i.e., they do not have to be broken in. They also tend to last longer than other types of bats. However, they have a smaller “sweet spot” than other types of bats, meaning that there is a more restricted area of the barrel for creating a good hit., Composite bats are made out of a synthetic, fibrous material. These bats tend to be more well-balanced than other types, and are better at absorbing vibrations from hits. However, they tend to be more expensive than alloy bats, and have to be broken in.Hybrid bats combine features of alloy and composite bats. A hybrid bat offers the comfort of a shock-absorbing composite handle along with the lower cost of an alloy barrel.
Be aware of the potential safety risks to other team members posed by composite bats. The higher ball speeds achieved by composite bats have the potential to cause serious injury to pitchers and defensive players.

, As the names suggest, one-piece bats are made of a single piece of material, while two-piece bats consist of a separate barrel and handle, sometimes made from two different materials, that have been assembled together. Once piece bats tend to be stiffer and better balanced, while two-piece bats are more flexible and better at absorbing shocks and vibrations. You should choose based on the girl’s playing style and personal preference.Have the girl test out both types of bat on the field before making a purchase. She may be able to borrow bats from other team members in order to test them out and see which type she likes best.

, The price of bats varies depending on materials, method of composition, and a variety of other factors. While you may be able to get a high-quality composite bat for around $100, softball bats may cost as much as $400. Have an idea of how much you are able to spend before you decide to purchase a bat, and speak to store employees about your price expectations."

Use the glove to play catch.,
Knead the glove by hand.,
Rough up the glove.,
Sleep on the glove.",How to Break in a Softball Glove1," The most surefire way to break in a stiff new softball glove is to use it to play catch frequently. This way, you’re using it for what it was designed for, and won’t have to worry about damaging the glove’s materials using unorthodox methods. The downside of simply playing catch to break in your glove is that it can take many hours of catching to soften the glove up enough.When catching a softball with a new glove, concentrate on enveloping and squeezing the ball with the area around the thumb and forefingers to form what is known as a “pocket.” This will give the glove a natural contour the size and shape of a softball and make catching easier as a result.;
, Use both hands to bend, pull, stretch, squeeze and roll the glove. Working the glove manually can also be a time-consuming way to break it in, but the upside is that it can be done absent-mindedly while you’re busy with other things. After a while, the repetitive contact will cause the leather of the glove to loosen up.Try kneading your new glove while you’re watching TV, talking with friends or sitting in traffic.
The natural oils on your hands can also be good for conditioning a stiff glove.

, Take out your aggression on your new glove and soften it up in the process. Punch it, kick it, stomp on it, hit it with a bat or throw it against the wall. It may seem odd to be so destructive to a new glove, but the abuse you dole out will simulate the pounding it will eventually take on the field. Just make sure you don’t damage any weaker areas of the glove, like the stitching.Softball gloves are fashioned from thick, durable leather, so you’re unlikely to damage the glove, as long as you don’t employ extreme measures like running it over in a car or dropping it off a cliff.

, One traditional method for breaking in a new glove is to fold it around a ball, stick it under your mattress and sleep on it for a night or two. What makes this effective is the constant heat and pressure from having your body weight on top of it for an extended period. As the glove warms up, it will begin to conform to the shape of the ball, while positioning your shifting mass over it while you sleep will massage away tension in the new leather.Make sure there is a ball in your glove before sleeping on it. The point is to form a defined pocket, not to flatten the glove out.
Play catch with your new glove by day and sleep on it at night. Between the two, the glove should be thoroughly broken in in no time.

"
"
Apply oil to soften the glove.,
Wrap the glove tightly with a band.,
Strike the glove with a mallet or bat.,
Leave a ball in the glove when you’re not using it.",How to Break in a Softball Glove2," Buy a bottle of conditioning oil to use on your glove. Squirt a dime-sized amount of the oil into a washcloth or applicator sponge and rub it into the palm area, fingers and stitching of the glove. Glove oils serve to soften the leather, and, once they’ve had a chance to set in, can protect it from hard impacts, dirt, scrapes and other elements of hard play.It’s important to treat the stitching and webbing of the glove with oil, as these parts absorb most of the strain from catching and gripping and need to be pliable.
Go easy on the oil. Use just enough to lightly coat the glove, and wipe away any excess oil that’s beading up on the leather. Too much oil can oversaturate the leather, making it heavy and susceptible to cracking., Place a softball firmly in the pocket of the glove, fold the glove around the ball and then secure it with thick rubber bands, twine or a set of unused shoelaces. Stretch or tie the bands in an “X” shape so that the glove is constricted at both the top, near the fingers, and bottom, at the base of the palm. Store the glove overnight, letting it rest around the ball. With time, the glove will relax and begin to take the shape of the ball.Since you’re breaking in a softball glove, make sure you don’t wrap the glove using anything smaller than a regulation size softball.

, If you don’t have anyone to play catch with, and don’t feel like slapping a ball into the glove repeatedly on your own, you can use a ball mallet, baseball bat or other similarly shaped object to simulate the impact of the ball. Use the striking surface to beat the glove in the center of the palm and in the space between the thumb and forefinger where the ball will rest. Oil the glove when you’re not using it to safeguard it against continual impact.In professional baseball, this is known as “manhandling,” and can be used to break in new gloves or keep them supple between games.Grip the striking implement firmly as you make impact to get used to squeezing around an object, the way you would when catching a ball. This will also give the stitching a bit of stretch.

, Anytime you’re not using the glove for games or practice, place a full-sized softball in the pocket and stash it away. If you make a habit of this, the glove will eventually conform permanently around the ball. This is a basic way to break in a new glove, but doubles as a form of maintenance, as the leather of a glove tends to change shape and texture over time.You can choose whether to wrap the glove and ball with bands when you put it away. Once the glove is mostly broken in, there won’t be much of a need to wrap it anymore. Just keeping a ball in the pocket will be enough to help it hold its shape.

Put the glove in the microwave.,
Heat the glove in the oven.,
Steam the glove.,
Leave the glove in a hot car.",How to Break in a Softball Glove3," Submerge the new glove in water, shake or wring out the excess and then place the glove in the microwave. Only leave the glove in the microwave for less than a minute at a time—otherwise, the leather can scorch, melt or warp. This is a bizarre and potentially destructive break-in strategy that is nonetheless advocated by some of the top players in the MLB.Despite the fact that this method is used by professional players, it is not recommended if you’re worried about keeping your glove in good shape for the long haul. Heating can cause the glove to shrink or crack, and as a result it may deteriorate faster with use.
Do not try to microwave your glove if it contains any metal parts.

, Preheat your oven to around 300 degrees. Rub some oil or shaving cream into the glove to condition it. Place it in the oven for around 3 minutes, just long enough to soften the leather and let the oil soak in. After you take the glove out of the oven, allow it to cool to the touch and then put it on and play a few passes of catch with it.This is an altogether safer method of heating a new glove than microwaving it, but a lengthy stay in intense heat may still damage the glove’s materials.

, Steaming is arguably the safest and most reliable way to heat-treat a softball glove. Take the glove to a professional to have it done safely for a small fee, or do it yourself at home. Simply fill a stock pot with water, bring it to a boil and hold the glove over the pot to allow the steam to hit it. Turn your hand slowly to expose each part of the glove to the steam, and make sure to place a ball in the pocket so the glove will conform around it as it softens.Wearing the glove while you steam it will help it shape itself to your hand, and also protect your hand from the heat of the steam.
Steaming will infuse moisture into your glove gradually, without the need to soak or submerge it, which can ruin the leather.

, If you’re breaking in a new softball glove during the summer months, wait until the next scorcher and leave the glove on your dashboard or in the trunk for a few hours. That’s it! The heat will begin to work on the leather, and the humidity in the atmosphere will loosen the glove and increase its flexibility. This is one of the easiest ways to break in a glove using heat, and there’s very little chance of damaging it in the process.It may be best to leave the glove out of direct sunlight, as the intensity of the sun’s rays may warp the leather or cause it to shrivel up."

You should position yourself in the middle of the batter’s box to ensure that you can take a swing at anything in the strike zone. Place your feet parallel to the direction that home plant is pointing towards, and shoulder-width apart.


Bend your knees a little, and try to distribute your weight evenly on the balls of your feet.;
, Take hold of your bat and grip it in both hands. If you are right-handed, the right hand is the top hand and the left hand the bottom hand. It is reversed for left-handers. The hands should be placed against each other, with the middle knuckles (or door-knocking knuckles) in a straight line. Grip the bat fairly loosely, and keep some flexibility in your wrists.Hold the bat a couple of inches up from the knob at the end of the bat.
If the bat seems a little long, heavy, or hard to handle, choke your hands up the handle an inch or two.Choking up can increase the amount of control you have as you swing, but will generally mean you hit with less power.

, When your grip and stance are set, you are almost ready to swing. First, check your hand position. As you hold the bat, your hands should be quite close to your body, around three or four inches in front of your chest. Ensure your elbows are down and your shoulders are relaxed and free of tension.


Then move your hands out a little, so they are around five to seven inches in front of your chest.
Point the bat upwards, and angle it towards you slightly as you turn your head to face the pitcher., Now you are in position and are awaiting the pitch. Once you see the pitcher moving towards the release, you need to make a small movement forward with your front foot. This is known as the stride, or the toe tap, and helps you get forward momentum into your swing. Step your front foot (left if you are a right hander) forward a few inches, and place it at an approximate 45 degree angle to the pitcher.The amount you step forward will generally depend on how tall you are. The taller you are, the longer your stride is likely to be.
For most people your stride will be between 2 – 8 inches. Make sure it is a small and fast movement.As you make this movement your front hip and shoulder may turn in a little. Try to keep your hips parallel and your front shoulder slightly lower than your back shoulder., You should start your swing with a movement in your hips and legs, before moving your hands and shoulders. As the ball approaches, push off the ball of your back foot and begin to rotate the hips forward, while keeping them parallel to the ground. Drive your front shoulder towards the ball, but try to keep a good bend in both your elbows. As you get closer to contact your top hand will begin to rotate. When you make contact, your top palm will be close to facing upwards.


Your hips should continue to rotate forwards as you swing and transfer the weight from your back foot to your front foot. As you swing you should try to keep the knob at the end of the bat’s handle inside of the path of the ball.
Doing this will help you to keep a slight bend in your elbows as you move through the swing.Make sure you keep your head and eyes level and still as you move through the swing.

, Lead with your elbow, not your hands, as you swing your bat towards the pitch. For a pitch down the middle you should be aiming to make contact with the ball directly in front of your front hip. At the point of contact, both arms should be bent at angles close to 90 degrees, but by the time you have driven the bat through the ball, both arms should be fully extended.If you make contact when your arms are already fully extended, you will not get the kind of power you would if you make contact when you have a slight bend in your elbow and wrist.When you make contact, your top palm should be facing directly up to the sky. The palm on your bottom hand should be facing down to the ground.Make sure you keep your eye on the ball, watch it onto your bat, and hit through it on a level plane.

, The swing isn’t finished when you have made contact with the ball. The follow through is an essential element in a great softball swing. Straight after you make contact, your top hand will take over from your bottom hand as you roll your wrists through the swing. Keep your swing going through your arms so that your hands finish high above and behind your head, and your chest is angled slightly upwards towards the sky.


When you finish your swing, your front foot should be open at a 45 degree angle to the pitcher.
Your front leg should be locked, and your back leg bent as the weight is shifted back.
Keep your eyes focussed on where you made contact with the ball., You can work on your swing at home just the going through the motions again and again, and thinking about how you move each part of your body. Try suspending a ball from the ceiling in your garage, or from a basketball hoop, and taking lots of smooth controlled swings. Work from slow swings to fast swings.


If you have a tee to hit from, use this.Try suspending the ball at different heights to give you practice of hitting balls at various heights.
You can also try throwing a ball up into the air in front of you and hitting it on the first bounce.

, It might be easier to practice with some friends, teammates or a coach. If you have someone to toss you some balls, you will be able to recreate hitting in a game more effectively. You can vary the drills and work on improving your vision by using different coloured balls, or balls with numbers written onto them.You will have to note the colour of the ball, or the number written on the ball, and call it out before you hit in.
Improving your softball vision will help you to read balls better and hit with more accuracy.

, Speeding up your swing can have a big impact on the amount of power you are able to impart when you make contact with the ball. You can try swinging with a heavier bat in practice and when you are warming up. The idea is that when you switch to a lighter bat in the game you will swing with more power and speed.


A good drill to increase speed and reactions times is the quick toss drill.
For this drill, have someone on the opposite side of the batter’s box to you.
Your training partner will then toss you two balls in quick succession.
You should try to hit the first and then quickly back in position and swing and hit the second., Another way to improve your swing is to do some strength training. Using a heavier bat when you practice will work in the same way, but you can also add some specific weight or resistance training to your routine. Look for exercises that will strengthen your core, abs, legs and forearms.Some good exercises to do that can help your swing include:


Crunches.
Leg raises.
Back bows.
Russian twists.
Squats and lunges.

Know what the game is about.",How to Be a Better Softball Player1,"


Softball is a game of repetition and mental toughness. To become better, it's practice, practice, practice.
Softball is all about the rules. Make sure you know the rules, because with knowing the rules, the steps of becoming a better softball player will be much easier.;
"
"
Get used to keeping a firm grip on the ball, enclosing it tightly in your glove.,
If you're just beginning, focus on one main position before being able to switch between positions.,
Get assistance with learning to pitch well.,
When pitching, don't swing your arm like crazy.,
Find your batting style.,
Use a good stance in batting.,
Grip firmly.,
Swing hard and deliberately with your eyes on the ball.",How to Be a Better Softball Player2," The softball itself is a lot bigger than the baseball. If you do not hold the ball tightly, it will fall out of your glove.

,


If you have a long throw, your best options are first base and third base, along with catcher.
If your throw is short, shortstop is your calling.
If you can catch and have a good arm, catcher is your position.
If you can run fast and catch, along with a good arm, the outfield should be on your mind.

, Pitching is something that should be coached, along with trying it on your own. If you show interest, bring it up to a coach and work with a pitcher and try to get lessons.

, Swing your arm in a quick circle but only after you learn how to control the pitch. If you are just starting out, don't try any fancy stuff. Just pitch and keep in mind at all times that your release point is at the base of your hip.


When you are throwing the ball snap it off the end of your fingers. It will give the ball speed and you can throw farther.
When pitching, don't focus on speed; focus on accuracy.

, There are many ways that work for individual batters, not just a big universal one, although they all are alike.

, Make sure your stance is shoulder-length apart to get a steady base along with your knees bent. Keep your arms behind your shoulder.


You should be driving your hands and elbow to the ball and coming along with a full follow through.
Keep your head down at the ball. Bringing your head up can cause a complete change in your batting.
If you need a confidence boost, jump up and down like the pros do in baseball.

, When you bat, grip the bat firmly. Wear batting gloves, so that if you hit it at the end of the bat or too close to your fingers, it won't sting.


When you are batting, keep your eye on the pitcher's hip. This is her release point. When she lets go of the ball, this is where it's coming out, so you will automatically have your eye on the ball to hit it.

, The softball needs to be hit hard. Have an attitude when you step up to the plate. It's softball, for crying out loud, not a beauty pageant. Get spittle mad, but not too mad that it's unsportsmanlike.


Always follow through with your swing. If you stop the bat at the point of collision, you've actually had to slow the bat significantly before ever reaching the ball, which takes a lot of power out of your swing.

"
Practice at home, as often as you can.",How to Be a Better Softball Player3," Go the extra mile, you will see great improvement.


Just throwing for 15 minutes a day with a partner(s) will have such a large improvement on your skill level.
Along with throwing, bat as often as you can. Many professional players still use tees. Use a tee against a wall, fence, net, etc. Just make sure you're getting hitting time as often as possible.

"
"
Keep your hair up in a braid or ponytail so it's off your neck.,
Remain mentally tough.,
Stay strong and never give up.",How to Be a Better Softball Player4," You will get hot if it's not.

, You need to have confidence on the field. Keep a positive attitude. Above, softball is mentioned as being a mental game. You cannot give the other team your mind.


Make sure you vision yourself doing whatever you do in a game.
Take a deep breath and do not get stressed over one mistake, because one can turn into six, and so on.
Concentrate, no matter who is watching or what someone is saying.
Recognize what your error is when your not pitching or playing well. The faster you recognize and fix your errors without stressing out over them, the better you will become. (as long as you practice frequently)

, No matter what, don't lose your confidence. You will have bad days, games, pitches, and moods. None of those are a reason to forget all the good days, good games, good pitches and great moods! Try to stay even keel and see losses as learning experiences to help you improve.

"
"
Ask and learn.,
Be ready to play.,
Don't have a bad attitude.,
Don't strike out looking!",How to Be a Better Softball Player5," If you don't know how to do something, ask a coach or a team member. Your coach will help if you ask but will likely be really annoyed if you assume to know everything but are just making it up as you go.


When coaches try to talk to you, let them. They may teach you something that could help out a lot. They'll certainly notice if you're unwilling to listen and learn; that can be a sign of being a poor team player.

, Right when you step on the softball field, it is game time! Hustle on and off of the field.

, This can infect you, the team and your coach. Stay positive, even when the chips are down.


If the coaches see you working really hard they will have a positive attitude about you.
If you see someone else down, cheer them up and be someone that people look up to.

, At least get your three cuts in, and swing the bat.

Make the necessary contacts.,
Attend a beginner's referee clinic.,

Start at the lowest levels.,
If you are looking to succeed as a hockey official opportunities such as officiating seminars and camps are are great way to gain exposure.,
Accept the challenges you'll face as a new hockey referee.",How to Become a Hockey Referee," If you decide that you want to become a referee, contact your local youth or minor hockey association. The organization will put you in touch with the league's supervisor of officials or referee-in-chief, RIC. Contact the RIC immediately and be sure to find out:


When the next clinic for beginning referees is going to be held.
Total cost of the seminar. For a beginner's clinic, fees generally run about $25.
Age or other requirements.;
, New hockey referees must complete an all-day clinic that includes administrative details and comprehensive instruction. Every referee, regardless of experience, must attend a U.S.A. Hockey-sanctioned clinic each year. Clinics are divided into 4 sections.


Enrollment: Pay your enrollment fee before starting the clinic. Also be prepared to complete registration and insurance forms. If you're a minor, you might be required to have parental permission before you can become a licensed hockey referee. Upon completion of the seminar, you will receive documentation that allows you to referee hockey games.
Classroom study: The majority of the clinic will be held in the classroom. A qualified instructor will teach aspiring referees the basics of officiating, including a comprehensive review of hockey rules. Referee clinics require you to pass an exam before moving on to on-ice instruction.
On-ice instruction: On-ice training covers skating, positioning and procedures. Instructors often lead clinic participants in a series of drills during on-ice instruction. This phase of the clinic usually lasts more than 1 hour.
Certification: When you are certified to officiate games, you will receive a membership card and your personal referee crest to wear on your uniform.

, Contact the league you want to referee hockey games in to find out when the next scheduling meeting is. You can sign up to officiate games then, or submit your available dates to the league online.

,


The best way to learn the basics of hockey officiating is to referee games at the lowest levels. Pee wee games are where most players learn how to play, and they provide an excellent learning environment for new referees, too. It's easier to officiate games in beginner leagues because they do not allow checking. This enables you to concentrate on the flow of the game and work on your positioning. Finding the optimum vantage point on the ice is an important part of being an effective referee. After positioning becomes second nature to you, you can move to intermediate leagues where you will be required to call a wider range of penalties.

, Another great opportunity is the online course at icehockeyreferee.com

, Officials in every sport face similar difficulties. How you confront yours will go a long way toward determining your success as a hockey referee. By keeping in mind certain principles, you can perform your role as a referee effectively and with integrity.


Criticism: All referees will be second-guessed by fans, player and coaches. Accept the fact that not everyone is going to be happy with your officiating every game.
Conditioning: A referee must be an excellent skater. Hockey officials stay on the ice the entire game, forcing them to skate several miles each contest. Referees also must be able to skate backward efficiently and change direction quickly.
Learning: You can improve your officiating in a number of ways. Ask experienced officials questions. Watch them during games. Continually review the rulebook.
Ethics: It's important to remember that, as the referee, you're something of a role model. Conduct yourself accordingly by always being firm, fair and courteous. Your chief goal as the presiding official of a game is to ensure that the game is played safely so that everyone can have fun.

, Steal, beg and borrow others methods of training and practice plans. Use different strategies to achieve more from your individual players. Some players are visual learners, some are textbook learners and some have the natural ability to play and understand the game. Practices should consist of skating, puck handling, shooting,and checking. Not only should each area be individualized, but should be incorporated into the practices before games. One big point when teaching or coaching hockey is to develop players that know their position. Positional play is important for the game to be played efficiently and effectively. Planning for strategy involves each player on the ice to be in the right place at the right time.

, This will lead players into becoming more effective in skating, puck handling, passing and shooting. Choose wisely to practice skills and essential plays to be used during game situations. These can include breakout plays from the defensive zone, offensive plays for scoring, and neutral zone plays to capitalize on puck possession.

Place yourself on the line-to-goal.,
Don’t get too spread out from your midfield line.,
Adjust your position (along with the rest of the defensive line) using the teeter-totter method.,
Always be ready on defense.,
Maintain a “bowl” shape with your other defenders when your team has the ball.",How to Be a Better Center Back in Field Hockey1," That is, if you were to draw a straight line from where the ball is on the field to where the goal is that you are defending, you should be positioned right on that line. This prevents the other team from hitting the ball straight down the field toward the goal.


Protecting the goal and the center of the field is your first priority. You want to force them to play the ball on the sides of the field, where it’s less dangerous.;
, When your team has the ball higher up the field (i.e. near the goal you are trying to score on), don’t get stuck too far back. Keep pushing up to support the midfielders and forwards.


When the other team regains possession, start backpedaling to retreat toward your own goal. Running backwards allows you to keep your eye on the ball at all times.
Make sure you also don’t push too far up in case the other team has a counterattack and you have to sprint back down the entire length of the field. You should never be much farther than the 50 yard line.

, The center back, right back, and left back should be readjusting as a unit according to where the ball is moving on the field. They should staggered on a diagonal line so as to not be caught in a flat line and risk being beat simultaneously.


For example, when an opponent is dribbling down the field on your right side, the right defender (closest to the ball) will step up to put pressure on that player. The center defender will remain in the center of the field but will be a few steps behind the line of the right defender. The left defender (furthest from the ball) will be staggered even further behind the center defender.
If the ball moves from one side to the other, the whole defensive line moves like a teeter totter. This allows for the other two defenders behind to be back-up support in case the first defender gets beat., Even if the action is far away and you feel like you have nothing to do defensively, you should always be checked into the game and adjusting your position, both laterally and vertically. That way, if something unexpected happens and the other team has a counterattack, you are already in position and ready to defend.

, You should be the closest to the goal you are defending (or the “deepest” on the field), with your left and right defenders at about 45 degree angles on either side of you.


This allows you to pass to them easily and move the ball up the field along the sidelines.
When your side defenders have the ball, you being on a slightly backwards angle helps them to safely pass back to you and away from danger in case they can’t go forward.

Know your marking strategy.,
Place yourself on the correct side of your mark according to the situation.,
Communicate to your teammates about who they should be marking.",How to Be a Better Center Back in Field Hockey2," Marking helps protect your defensive zone of the field by covering space or opposing players to keeping them from scoring. The two main types of marking techniques are zone and man-to-man, and many teams use a mix of both depending on the situation.Zone marking means a player is responsible for the space around them. For example, the right back is responsible for the back right corner of the field. Any opposing player who enters that space is their responsibility. This marking strategy is best when gameplay is spread out and opponents are interchanging positions, so that you can simply “switch” marks with your teammates instead of chasing them down the field.
Man-to-man marking means each player chooses an opponent to mark and always sticks with them, no matter where they go on the field. A useful trick is to memorize the number on your mark’s jersey so that you never lose her. This marking strategy is best when gameplay is past-paced and confined near the goal you are defending because it limits confusion on who is marking whom amidst potential chaos. Every single opponent who enters your defensive circle surrounding the goal should be closely marked at all times.Marking is not just for defenders. Make it clear to your team (especially the midfielders) that they should be helping out with marking as well. Even your forwards should be sprinting back during a counterattack.

, Sometimes it is best to step in front of your mark to block her from receiving a pass and intercept it yourself. Other times it is better to stay close behind your mark (in between her and the goal) so that even if she receives the ball she cannot go straight to goal.


Deciding the best way to position yourself while marking should come naturally as you assess each scenario. When in doubt, ask your coach for advice.

, Since you can see what is happening on the entire field front of you, your role as a center back is to make sure all “dangerous” attacking players on the opposing team are marked.


In a clear, loud voice, direct your teammates in front of you on where to position themselves and tell them to mark up if they are not doing so already.
You can say something like, “Hey Sarah, mark #5!” or give them more directional instructions like, “Watch #13 behind your left shoulder!” to give them an idea of where their marks are.

"
"
Force or channel them to one side of the field.,
Jab at the ball.,
Tackle to get the ball from your opponent.,
Double-team your opponent.",How to Be a Better Center Back in Field Hockey3," An important defensive principle in field hockey is to minimize the opposing player’s space by guiding them away from your goal and the center of the field. When someone is dribbling toward you, always force them toward the sidelines.Since you are the center back, you have an option of which side you want to force them to. It is better to force them to your right side because that is your “strong side” of your stick. Note the left side players do not want to take this approach and instead want to force them to their left side, toward the sideline.
Position your body slightly to the left so that your shoulders are open toward the right. “Invite” them to dribble toward your strong side. Use the sideline or another defender to help you trap them into a small space.
If you are running neck-and-neck with your opponent who is dribbling the ball, keep forcing her to one side. This is called shadowing her down the field. Try as hard as you can to keep running at the same speed as her and keep her from cutting you off. One of your other teammates will likely come to your help and you can double-team her together.

, Jabbing is when you quickly poke at the ball with your stick when your opponent is dribbling to make them mess up or lose the ball.


Be sure you are not too close to your opponent. Position yourself about a stick-length away from her.
Reposition your grip on the stick as if you were holding a frying pan with your left hand. In one fluid motion, release your right hand from the stick and extend your left arm (holding to stick) while simultaneously lunging toward the ball so that the toe of your stick hits the ball.
Quickly retrieve your stick with both hands. A jab only lasts a second or two - don’t let your stick linger near the ball. You can perform a few quick jabs in a row if you weren’t successful the first time.
The point of jabbing is not necessarily to gain possession of the ball, but to distract and mess up the player with the ball in order to set yourself up for a more successful tackle.

, Now that you've distracted or messed up your opponents with a few jabs, you are ready to lay down a tackle.


The best way to tackle is to lie your stick flat on the ground on your right side, crouching down so that you are in a strong, athletic stance. Keep your hands far apart on your stick for stability.
Collect the ball on your stick and push through until you have regained possession. Be sure not to “hack” or continuously swing/hit at the ball with your stick. This will be a foul called against you.
Do not dive into tackles, as it makes it easier for the opposition to beat you. Time your tackles only when you know you have a good chance of coming up with the ball, once you have already put significant pressure on your opponent. Do not tackle if your opponent is coming towards you with a lot of speed and space.

, Of course, the best defense is team defense. You and another teammate can work together so that one person is putting pressure and forcing the opponent toward a space where the other person is waiting there to tackle.


Communication is key when double-teaming. If you are the tackler, guide your teammate ahead of you on where they should force the opponent by saying things like “Stay with her, force her right!”

"
"
Clear the ball out to the sides when you come up with it.,
Pass more than you dribble.,
Take 16 yard hits.,
Be the pivot player on transfers.",How to Be a Better Center Back in Field Hockey4," If you make a tackle and regain possession of the ball, avoid passing the ball down the middle of the field. This can be very dangerous, because if they are intercepted, it could lead to a fast counterattack.


If your left and right defenders are correctly positioned, they should be ready to receive the ball from you on the sidelines. You may even have a side midfielder open further up the field to pass to.
If you cannot find a sideline teammate to pass to and you find yourself under a lot of pressure, hit the ball over the sideline anyways. This is the safest option. Even though it will be the other team’s free hit, at least it will buy your team time to set up to defend.
The only time you should hit the ball up the center of the field is if you have a wide open channel and an open teammate to pass to, with no risk of your pass being intercepted.
Never intentionally hit the ball over your back endline. This will be called as a foul against you, resulting in a short corner, a set play in which the offensive team has a very strong chance of scoring.

, As a center defender, your role is to be a distributor, not a dribbler. Never go sprinting up the field with the ball, because if you get it taken away you leave your team in trouble by being out of position on defense.Make sure your passes are hard so that they go fast and far up the field. You want to clear it as far as you can away from your defensive zone. Also make sure they are flat to the ground, as high balls will be called as a foul.

, As the center back, you will usually taking free hits at the top of the circle (16 yards from the endline) after the ball has gone over the endline off of the stick of an opposing player. This is like the equivalent of a “goal kick” in soccer.16 yard hits are a new opportunity to generate offensive plays from the back. Pass the ball mainly to your side defenders on the left and right of you using a hit, sweep, or a strong push. Then they can send it up the field.
Occasionally, you can feed the ball up to your midfielders, and on rare occasions, you may be able to pass the ball all the way up to your forwards using a strong hit or aerial (a very high pass in the air). Be cautious, however, and only use these longer passes when your teammates are wide open.

, Sometimes when you watch high-level field hockey, you will notice the ball being passed across from the left back to the center back to the right back, or vice versa. This is called a transfer because the ball is being transferred from one side of the field to another. As the deepest player on this transfer, you are the “pivot” player.


Transfers can happen just once or multiple times in a row. One transfer from the left to right, for example, gives your team a chance to attack from a different angle. Multiple transfers in a row allow your teammates upfield time to reset and find open spaces, and also tire out the opposing team’s forwards.
Keep passing the ball across to the other side using a strong hit or push. If you receive it from your right back, you will likely turn your body and pass it over to your left back.
Once your teammates up the field become open, only then should you or your other defenders hit it up to them. When transferring the ball, patience is key.

, Loop the shooting string through the mesh near one sidewall, with one end in front, and one end in back.


Pull the strings so that they are even.

, Push the back string through the mesh to the front, and then the front string to the back.


Repeat the weaving process across the basket. When you reach the other side, slip the string through the sidewall, and tie a knot to secure it.

Remember that soccer is a team sport.,
Try to move the ball more than yourself.,
Anticipate.,
Press.,
Use the element of surprise.,
Use the sides of the field.,
Triangulate.,
Remain focused.,
Show your combative spirit.,
Develop your sense of orientation.,
Communicate with your teammates.,
Practice.,
Spread out.,
Have fun.",How to Improve Your Game in Soccer," Always play with that in mind. Never play for your own glory, but for the whole team's sake. It's better to sacrifice some personal recognition and make sacrifices for the team.;
, It is an energy-saving strategy. If you run all the time everywhere on the field, you will be tired within the first 10 minutes. Remember that the ball will always move faster than you. So its better to move it around fast than move yourself with it. Save your energy for when you really need to run.

, This is a good one whether you are defending or creating game. Anticipate while the ball is moving towards you. The best thing to do is know what to do with the ball the moment it gets to you. Anticipation when you are defending is equally important. If you can foresee your opponent's next move, it will increase your chances of stopping his/her move. Velocity is crucial in this game.

, Don't let your opponent receive the ball so neatly. Make him/her receive the ball facing backwards. Put pressure on him/her and force him/her to make mistakes. Be careful, however, of committing a foul or injuring your opponent.

, Don't make your next move too obvious. Put the ball at the back of the last defending line while a teammate runs to receive your assistance. Change the rhythm of your run, quick at first and when your opponent is coming at you, step on the brakes. He/she will also stop, then increase the pace again, leaving them anchored. When dribbling with the ball, don't be predictable. If you just used a move on a defender, that defender will be more prepared when you do that move again, so mix it up a little bit.

, If there are too many people in the center, it will be difficult to create game in that area, so use wing-men on your team to exploit the sides. Penetrate those areas and then send the ball to the center for a teammate to finish the play. Hint- be careful not to knock the ball out of bounds of the field when you do this.

, Association is the best way to break tight defenses. Use your surrounding teammates to pass the ball to each other quickly, creating confusion in your opponent.

, Don't forget that the game hasn't finished until the referee says so. So don't lose yourself only because you are winning or because there is little time left. A goal in the last minute can make you lose a game or even a championship.

, If the coach sees the devotion you put in the game, your chances of being on the main team will increase. Don't ever give up, go up and down, help your teammates, defend and attack, let your attitude be an inspiration for your team.

, Having good orientation and a complete view of the game is difficult when you are in there on the field. Knowing where your teammates and your opponents are gives you a better perspective and helps you to better plan your next move.

, Giving them a ""6th sense"" to what is going on around them not only helps them, but keeps you focused and engaged in the game even when you're not directly involved in the play.

, Spend about an hour everyday just as solitary practice or with a friend or coach working on the things you need to improve on. (One thing to practice is keeping the ball low. Practice just tapping the ball in low, then getting gradually more powerfully.

, A mistake that most teams and most players have is all the players flocking near the ball. If an opponent has the ball, one person is enough. If a fellow teammate has the ball give them some space. But remember to have a player a bit behind whoever has or whoever is trying to steal the ball.

, This is the most important tip in this article, so pay attention. If you're not having fun while playing this game, then why are you still playing?

Don't be afraid to come out of the crease!",How to Be a Lacrosse Goalie," Equipment is necessary in this position. (see Things You'll Need);
, You'll want to stand about a step away from the front to cut off the angle but also have enough time to react. Your dominant hand should be gripping the neck of the stick while your non dominant hand should be a forearm's length away from the top hand, a little higher than the middle of the stick.

, Make sure you're stepping forward at a 45 degree angle, leading with the foot that's on the same side (aka ball comes from right side, step w/ right foot). Center shots, step with whichever foot you prefer.

,,,, Slide both hands down, with the non dominant gripping the end of the stick and the dominant a couple inches above it.

, Push with your top arm and pull with the bottom arm, following through to the other side of your body. Don't be afraid of the ball.

,, If the ball is on the other side of the field, come out of the crease to yell at your defense so that when the ball comes back, they know what to do.

Have the ball stationery or moving in front of your feet.,
(This step is optional) Do a single step-over with your preferred foot.

,Move your non-preferred foot over the ball in a anti-clockwise fashion (opposite to a stepover)

,Simultaneously spin around 180 degrees (and the back of your preferred foot should be facing the ball)

,
Backheel the ball with your preferred foot.

,(optional variation for different circumstances)Instead of back-heeling you could also do a roll forward with your preferred foot and evade defenders(this variation will go backwards and leaves an opening free of defenders where it is possible to continue your run, or pass)

Do an offensive header to score on high crosses and set-pieces.,
Keep your eyes open.,
Keep your mouth closed to prevent injury.,
Square your shoulders to line up with the goal.,
Jump high enough to aim the ball downwards.,
Hit the ball with the middle of your forehead.,
Make contact with the middle of the ball.,
Arch your back and push your shoulders forward for more power.",How to Head a Soccer Goal1," With offensive headers, you score by jumping up and using your forehead to re-direct high balls. It’s a perfect goal for two people to score together, with one player assisting and one scoring. Together, you’ll put balls in the net that would otherwise sail over the top goalpost., You should keep your eyes open and trained on the ball from the minute you get ready to head the ball until you’re ready to celebrate or shed a few tears. This will not only help you shoot accurate goals, it’ll also keep you from crashing into other players. If you jump up high enough, you may also need your eyes to help you land on your feet safely., If you open your mouth when you head balls, you may it shut it randomly when you make contact with the ball. This could cause you to bite your tongue or hurt your jaw., As you get ready to head the ball, it’s important to keep your body straight and lined up with the goal. You’ll be using your your abdomen and back muscles, as well as the muscles in your neck to score. If you twist your body, the amount the power in your strike will be limited by your compressed core muscles., In order to get the ball into the net, you’ll need to head it in that direction. Jump up so that your eyes are above the ball. This will let you control your header and attack the ball with your forehead from above., Move your head forward quickly to attack the ball with your forehead. Use the middle of your forehead (right above your eyebrows) to head the ball, since this is the largest and flattest surface on your head. This spot will give you more control over the direction of your goal.Don’t be afraid of the ball. Remember that heading the ball is one of the most effective -- and coolest -- ways you can score a goal. Be positive and follow through with confidence in your game.Be sure not to hit the ball with either the top or sides of your head. You won’t be able to keep your eyes on the ball or the goal with these approaches. This will make your headers harder to control and more inaccurate.

, Most offensive headers involve you shifting a high ball so it goes straight into the net. To point the ball downwards, hit it right in the middle with your forehead. If your forehead connects with a spot too high on the ball, it may go straight down into the ground. Too low, and the ball will soar right over the top goalpost., Engaging your core and neck muscles will improve the strength of your attacks and the accuracy of your headers. As you get ready to jump up and hit the ball with your forehead, arch your back while thrusting your shoulders forward. This should get you on your way to racking up the points."

Prepare to head the ball.,
Gain momentum.,
Head the ball.",How to Head a Soccer Ball1," As the soccer ball approaches, you must maintain eye contact with the ball and acquire your balance. Execute these steps at the same time:


Keep your eyes open and focused on the ball.
Close your mouth.
Plant both of your feet firmly on the ground. If you are right handed, your left foot should be slightly forward; if you are left handed, your right foot should be slightly forward.;
, Once you are braced for the ball's arrival, you need to gain momentum by bending your knees. This will increase your momentum and balance. These movements occur simultaneously:


Bend slightly at your knees.
Bend backwards at your waist and arch your back.
Tuck your chin., Your risk for head injuries increases when you passively allow the ball to hit you. When the ball arrives within heading distance, you need to propel yourself towards the ball in order to actively hit it. This series of movements begins at your hips:


As you bend forward at the hips, thrust your head and chin forwards and drive your arms backwards.
Hit the ball with the center of your forehead along your hairline.
In a game situation, you may need to jump up to reach the ball."
"
Dive for balls that are at your waist level or lower.,
Square your shoulders to line up with the goal.,
Flex your knees to prepare for your jump.,
Keep your eyes locked on the ball.,
Dive forward parallel to the ground.,
Tilt your head back and hit the ball with the middle of your forehead.,
Extend your arms to catch yourself as you fall.",How to Head a Soccer Goal2," Dives are perfect for scoring off low balls. This move is usually used to score off passes or corner kicks. It’s a dramatic and powerful way to get the goal in the net., As with offensive headers, you’ll need to use your core and neck muscles to hit the ball with enough power to move it into the goal. Avoid twisting and compromising these muscles by keeping your body lined up with the goal., In order to hit the ball accurately on a dive, your jump needs to get you in position to make contact with the ball. You don’t want to miss it in the air! Make sure you’re ready to strike by bending your knees and keeping your weight on the balls of your feet., It’s important that you try to guess (as best as you can!) where the ball is going to go. This will allow you to meet it with your forehead during your dive. Since things move so fast in soccer, if you take your eyes away from the ball for even a second, you probably won’t be able to score on a dive., Launch yourself into the air in a dive that moves you forward parallel to the ground. This move should put you on the same trajectory as the ball, so you and it are moving toward each other. The dive will add power to the hit you’re about to give the ball with your forehead.Be sure to use both feet to propel yourself into the air. It’s harder to get an accurate and powerful dive when jumping off only one foot., As you approach the ball, tilt your head back and move it forward quickly to gain momentum. Hit the ball with the middle part of your forehead, using the large and flat surface for accuracy and power.As with all headed goals, make sure your eyes are open and your mouth is closed during your entire dive.

, Once you’ve headed the ball, bring your arms up to catch your body weight. Catch yourself with your arms and chest instead of your wrists. This should help you land safely and with minimal bruising.Catching too much weight on your wrists could lead to broken bones.
Diving for headers can be especially scary since you know you’re getting ready to fall down on the ground. Spend plenty of time practicing with friends to perfect landing dives safely.

"
Choose a glancing header to disguise your goal.,
Angle your body away from the direction of your header.,
Turn your head to meet the ball right before impact.,
Hit the ball on different sides to move it to the left or right.",How to Head a Soccer Goal3," Glancing headers involve you turning your head into the ball at the last minute. This helps you trick the goalie. This sneaky technique may be exactly what your team needs to beat your toughest rivals., In order to keep the goalie from anticipating your goal, deliberately angle your body away from where you plan to head the ball. This may feel different from other headers, since you usually want your body squared up with the goal. However, this altered step is a key part of fooling the goalkeeper.Glancing headers require less force than other headed goals, as you’re usually just redirecting already-powerful crossed passes or corner kicks to fool the goalie at the last second. This means that the power you get from a squared-off body is less critical here than with other headed goals., Run to the ball to get yourself in position. Jump up and turn your head at the last minute to change the direction of the ball. By turning your head so late, you keep the goalie from being able to move quickly enough to make a save., When you want to make the ball quickly go left, hit it on the right side with the center of your forehead. To shift it to the right, strike it on the left. These quick changes in direction will increase the sneakiness of this move."
"
Head balls to yourself to practice your forehead placement.,
Practice with a partner to head balls on the run.,
Sit down and head balls to develop core strength.,
Practice diving headers on a mat.",How to Head a Soccer Goal4," Throw balls up in the air and jump up to head them into the goal. This low-pressure drill will allow you to work on centering the ball on the middle of your forehead to get accurate and powerful strikes., It’s harder to head the ball when you’re on the run and not just standing still. Of course, during games, you’re usually going to need to run to meet the ball! Grab a partner and practice scoring while you’re running. Your partner can either pass the ball to you normally, or throw the ball up into the air., It’s important to develop the muscles you need to powerfully attack balls with your head. To make sure you’re strengthening especially your core and neck muscles, sit down while you strike the ball with your forehead. You can throw the ball up in the air, head it, and catch it yourself for this drill., Diving headers can be tough and even a little scary. To learn how to score these goals, practice your dive by bringing a mat out into the soccer field. This will allow you to dive without worrying too much about the hard landing, and you’ll be able to focus on your technique and accuracy. This will also let you practice landing safely on your chest and arms instead of on your wrists."

Tap the ball with your forehead.,
Knock the ball off your coach’s hand.,
Tap the ball from your knees.,
Tap the ball from your feet.,
Head a tossed ball.",How to Head a Soccer Ball2," This drill teaches players how to move their head towards the ball. It also teaches players how to consistently contact the ball on the correct area of their forehead. Players will also enhance their ability to remain focused on the incoming ball.


Have a coach hold the ball four inches from your forehead. When you nod your head, the ball should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline.
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.
While looking at the ball, tap your head against the soccer ball several times.
Repeat.
Once you have mastered this, take the ball from your coach and hold it above your own forehead. Nod your forehead into the ball as your eyes remain focused on the ball. Do not pull the ball towards your head.
Repeat., This drill reinforces players’ knowledge of how to move their head. It provides them with additional practice of contacting the ball in the correct area of their forehead. This exercise also further develops their ability to remain focused on an incoming ball.


Stand up.
Have a coach stand 90° to your left or right.
The coach stretches out their arm and places a ball on their palm four inches from your forehead. When you nod your head, the ball should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline.
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes open.
Tap the ball with your forehead, knocking the soccer ball from your coach’s hand.
Repeat., This drill teaches players how to propel their body towards the ball at their waist. It also allows players to practice tucking their chin. Instead of executing this drill from your knees, you may sit on your heels or on the ground.


Place your knees on the ground.
Have a coach stand in front of you while holding a ball four inches from your forehead. When your head contacts the ball, it should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline.
Simultaneously bend backwards from your waist and tuck your chin.
Bend forward from the waist and nod your forehead into the soccer ball.
Repeat.., After you have mastered tapping the ball from your knees, you can progress to tapping the ball from a standing position. In this drill, players learn how increase their stability through the proper placement of their feet. They also will continue to work on propelling their body forward from their hips.


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. If you are right handed, your left foot should be slightly forward; if you are left handed, your right foot should be slightly forward.Have a coach stand in front of you while holding a ball four inches from your forehead. When your head contacts the ball, it should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline.
Bend backwards at your waist and tuck your chin.
Bend forward at the waist and tap your forehead against the stationary ball.

, This drill teaches players how to head a ball in motion. As you improve, gradually increase the distance between you and the coach by one-foot increments. The coach may also gradually increase the intensity of the throw, but never the arc.


Stand three feet in front of a coach. Place your feet shoulder-width apart. If you are right handed, your left foot should be slightly forward; if you are left handed, your right foot should be slightly forward.
The coach gently underhand tosses the ball in a slight arch towards your forehead.
As the ball approaches you, bend backwards at the waist and tuck your chin.
Just before the ball reaches your forehead, bend forward at the waist and contact the ball. Try to head the ball back at the coach’s waist.
Repeat."

Execute a defensive header.,
Execute a flick header.,
Head the ball into the goal.",How to Head a Soccer Ball3," Defensive players commonly use headers to clear the ball away from the goal. The objects of the defensive header are to move the ball away from the center of the field and as far down the field as possible. To execute this header, position your body towards the outside of the field and hit the bottom of the ball as hard as you can with the center of your forehead near your hairline., Players use the flick header to pass the ball from teammate to teammate. Both offensive and defensive players use this form of header. To execute the flick header, hit the ball on the top of your head as you simultaneously move your head up and backwards., There are three types of headers you can use to score on goal. These include an offensive header, diving header, and glancing header. Offensive headers used to place the ball low in the goal; diving headers are executed when the ball is too far out in front of your foot to kick with any appreciable force; glancing headers are used to fake out the goalie.Offensive headers: Effective offensive headers are kept low and directed towards the ground. Head the ball down and away from the goalie.
Diving headers: When you dive towards the ball, the momentum of your entire body propels the ball towards its target. As you dive at the ball, focus on contacting the ball with your forehead and directing the ball towards the goal. Try to land the dive on your chest and arms. Do not break the fall with your wrists.
Glancing header: This cross-body header is used to fake out goalies. In order to execute this header effectively, you must learn how to direct the ball with your forehead. If you want to head the ball to the left, try to hit the right side of the ball; if you want to head the ball to the right, try to hit the left side of the ball. Do not use the side of your head to hit the ball."

",How to Be a Better Field Hockey Player," It is easier to maneuver the ball that way and you can get more power and accuracy out of pushes, hits, and drives. With the ball in front of you, there is less risk of your stick rolling over the ball.;
, This can go a long way to improving how well your perform.Take up strength training and work on overall fitness.

, Any type of hit where your lift your stick is an opportunity to get a penalty or to get the ball taken away from you.

, Stepping on a ball or not moving your feet fast enough is something that can be easily corrected, but if not will result in the other team getting a free hit, so just move your feet!

, This gives you a much larger area to stop the ball with and increases your chances of getting the ball greatly.

, Better it go out of bounds then for them to get a direct shot on goal.

, Just trust me on this one, it is much easier to get up on the field this way as there are less players crowded over to the sides and it's easier to maneuver.

, Listen to your coaches and your teammates.

,, Channel them down the side, preventing them from passing in towards the middle. Run them out over the backline. They cannot score unless they come into the circle. Watch for the back pass from the baseline towards the spot though.

Keep the whole team engaged as much as possible.,
Tailor scrimmages to the skills you worked on in practice.,
Praise hustle and hard work just as much as technical ability.,
Correct techniques and mistakes as you see them.,
Try to make conditioning more than just running or sprints.",How to Have a Good Soccer Practice1," This is especially important with younger kids, but even older players benefit from focused practices. Don't try and teach individual defending, corner kick plays, shooting, and two new drills on the same day. Instead, plan ahead of time to focus on one or two specific areas, allowing players to really concentrate on improving these areas. Some areas of practice naturally work well together, as well:


Crossing and aerial work (headers, clearances, marking in the box, etc.)
One on one defending and shooting.
Short passes and off-the-ball movement.
Close foot-skills and combination play (overlaps, one-two passes, etc.);
, Static stretching, the classic ""bend and hold,"" can actually cause more problems than it prevents.Today's coaches use dynamic stretching, which gets the body moving and prepares your players with more game-like motions and movements. To make an effective dynamic warm-up, have the players:


Jog for 5-10 minutes, often with a ball at their feet.
Switching every 20 yards (18.3 m) or so, do lunges, high knees, butt kickers, side-shuffles, jumping jacks, and skips.
Do 2-3 accelerating sprints, where they start at a jog and then work to top speed.
Lightly stretch any sore muscles., Obviously, you aren't going to count. The more important concept is that players should be on the ball as much as possible in practice. While there are plenty of uses for ball-less drills -- teaching positioning, discussing tactics, working on plays -- almost every drill can be made more efficient if the players are getting touches on the ball as well.Be aware of drills where only 1-2 players touch the ball. Can you incorporate passing, break the drill into smaller groups, or find another way to get the ball on player's feet?
High-intensity ball drills, such as passing drills, dribbling activities, or even partnered crossing, are a great way to start practice with a focus on technique.

, If you're focusing on how to curve crosses, for example, you don't just want to teach it and move on. Start with a demonstration about how to curve the ball, then let the kids start trying it in pairs. From there, reinforce the skill through drills or scenarios. For example, you might do a crossing drill where players must take a touch down the line, then hit a cross to an attacker in the box. Finding 2-3 ways to teach and practice the skill is the best way to nail it down.

, Avoid activities where most players are standing in line, or where one group of players sit and watch for long periods of time. As much as possible, keep kids active and moving. If you do have drills that require some standing around, there are ways to use the time effectively:


When players are in line, have them pair up and pass while waiting. They must keep their head up as the pass so they don't miss their turn in line, which is another valuable skill.
Instead of sitting a group out during scrimmages or drills, separate them out on the end lines as ""wings"" that the offensive team can pass to, teaching good wide, expansive play.

, For example, say you worked on crosses and headers in the first half of practice. To drive the point home, you might play a scrimmage where aerial goals count for two points, or that a team must hit at least one long cross before they are allowed to score. If you're working on smart passing and triangles, don't play a full-field scrimmage -- keep the area small to make dribbling impossible.


Scrimmages are not ""free play"" time, they are the time to practice the skills learned in practice in a game-like setting.
In general, smaller scrimmages (3v3, 4v4, etc.) are best for fitness and ball skills, whereas larger scrimmages help focus on tactics, off-ball movement, and positioning., Practice is the time to get better, not to show off what players already know. You want to create an atmosphere where players are willing to make mistakes, as long as they are working hard to fix them. For example, a player may hit five bad crosses in a row with their left foot because they are right-footed. Don't yell at them, which teaches them to just use their stronger right foot. Let them make the mistakes now and praise them for working on weaknesses.


In general, the best way to get a lazier player to work hard isn't to yell at them, but to praise the players that are challenging themselves. The other players will often follow suit to earn your attention., If you see a player trying to hit a cross and they always swing their legs across their body without turning their hips, don't just sit and watch even if they hit a good cross occasionally. You want to be positive but proactive to make your players the best they can be. When correcting bad behavior or technique, use the ""sandwich method"" of a compliment, then advice, then another compliment:


""I love how hard you're working, but I need you to focus on squaring your hips when shooting. You've got a really good shot, this will just make it more accurate."", Conditioning is a necessary part of training, but that doesn't mean players will like it. The more you engage kids, the harder they will work, so finding conditioning that isn't only punishment or grueling sprints can actually help your team get stronger faster. Some ideas include:


Getting conditioning through scrimmages: make the field bigger with fewer players to force more movement, make the team that got scored on sprint back to their goal before starting, or run 1-2 minute ""burst games"" where the losing team must do push-ups.
Have the player's pair up and pass back and forth while jogging​ or, if you have enough balls, have every player dribble as they run.
Do push-ups and sit-ups with the team, showing it's not just punishment, it's a good way for everyone to get stronger."
"
Eat a light meal 1-2 hours before starting.,
Set training goals.,
Use warm-ups to target any soreness or tightness beyond the coach's warmup.,
Stay on your toes, in an active athletic position, whenever practicing.,
Develop skill with both feet.,
Focus on individual defending in scrimmages and one-on-one drills.,
Do every drill, game, or activity at game speed.,
Cool down with light stretching and a jog to prepare for the next practice.",How to Have a Good Soccer Practice2," You need energy to have a good soccer practice. Avoid cheese or dairy, as well as greasy, fatty, and overly sugary foods and drinks. Instead, look for simple carbohydrates, like white bread, pasta, or rice, and some lean proteins like chicken, peanut butter, tuna, or turkey slices.


PB & Js, light spaghetti bowls, pretzels and hummus, or a turkey sandwich are all good options.
Wash this meal down with 1-2 tall glasses of water and keep drinking as practice approaches.

, The first step to getting better at something is to know what you want to get better at. Setting training goals lets you get the most out of drills, find and eliminate weak spots in your game, and challenge yourself to get better. Keep these goals specific -- instead of ""be a better passer,"" decide to work on left foot passing, one touch passes, or hitting more accurate crosses.


Play multiple positions in practice -- work on becoming a stronger overall player when possible to succeed wherever you are on the field.
If you're struggling with one of your goals, talk to your coach for advice. Ask if he has any drills or techniques you can work on during practice to improve.
Take control of your practices -- your coach is there to help you get better, but you'll be twice as good if you're proactive about your own play as well.

, While your coach likely has a good warm-up planned for you, you should still take care to your own unique needs. After doing the team warm up, gently stretch any areas you need to take care of on your own. When possible, use dynamic warm-ups, which keep you moving instead of just pulling and holding a stretch:


Side shuffles are good for inner thigh stretches.
Lunges are good for hip flexor stretches
High knees are good for hamstring stretches
Butt kickers are good for quad stretches., Being ""on your toes"" is the mantra of many coaches, and for good reason. Keeping your weight on the balls of your feet instead of your heels helps you spring into action on a moments notice. In a game, you should almost always be up on your feet, ready to run, pass, or jump, so build the habit in practice.


Bend your knees slightly.
Lean forward and inch or so.
You should be able to instantly push off to either side. If you need to bend your knees or shift your weight first you're not on your toes.

, Players who are effective with both their right and left feet are incredibly dangerous on the field. Practice is the time to take your weak foot and turn it into a weapon. Whenever possible, try to alternate feet, and force yourself to take crosses, shots, and passes with your weak foot in scrimmages.


Remember that now is the time to make mistakes. The more you learn from errors now the less you'll cause in a game.

, One on one defending, where you need to tackle or steal the ball from an attacker by yourself, is an essential skill no matter what position you play. Even strikers need to be able to challenge and defend against the other team's backs, as winning the ball back is the first step towards scoring. Some tips for individual defending include:


Bend slightly at the hips, staying on the balls of your feet, to move quickly.
Keep one foot forward, using this foot and you body to force them to go to one side of you. Push them towards the sideline or one of your teammates.
Look at their belt-buckle area. Where a player's hips point generally tells you where they're about to go., The more you can treat practices like games, the better you will be when an actual whistle blows. Unless you have a game the next day and need to rest slightly, which your coach should note, you should be challenging yourself at every opportunity to play at game pace. Practice isn't about showing off, it is about getting better. This only happens if you push yourself.


Challenge your teammates, especially on other teams. Some healthy competition makes everyone better.
Don't shy away or hide weakness -- this is the time to improve them.
You should be tired out after drills and practices, so don't try and save energy.

, A good cool down helps your muscles relax and prevents soreness and injury the next day. Take a light jog, almost at walking pace, and shake out any tight muscles. This is a good place for gentle static stretching as well, so feel free to lightly grab and hold sore muscles for 10-20 seconds each.


While you should always be drinking water, be sure to have a full glass after practice to replenish lost fluids. Dehydration is a big cause of later soreness.
Get some food within an hour of practice to help fuel muscle regeneration and repair.

Realize that half volleys as a goalkeeper arise mostly when you have the ball in hand and need to clear it.
,Start with the ball in your hands, toss it up once to test what height you're comfortable with.,Start a run up.,Take a step or two and, then, toss the ball diagonally forwards.,Let the ball pitch once, and when it is coming up—about 10-20cm (4-8"") off the ground—connect your laces with the base of the ball, foot at an angle of about 30°.,
Follow through by letting your kicking leg complete its path before balancing yourself.",How to Half Volley a Soccer Ball1,",,,,, Sudden stops make you lose balance, so make sure your body is free and loose.

A low follow through with your body over the ball, or nearly so, will keep the ball low, whereas, a higher clearing shot occurs when your body is further away from the ball and you are leaning back or when you contact the ball when it is further off the ground.
While the angle of contact and positioning is the same when you are a defender or a midfielder, you do not have as much space, and are usually under pressure from an opponent. In this case, shield the ball first, and then take the kick. Also, make sure your follow through does not injure anyone.

"
"
Realize that half volley situations are extremely rare in the middle of the park, where close control dominates.,Make sure the ball is at least three footsteps away before making up your mind to half volley.,Start your run up by taking average or long strides first, but reduce the stride length as you reach the ball.,
Get really close to the ball efficient control and use your infoot to make the pass.",How to Half Volley a Soccer Ball2," Situations still arise when you may have to half volley the ball in order to give out a lob pass to a teammate.This is different than the case of a defender, where brute power can do the job. As a midfielder, your pass needs to be accurate and able to be handled by the receiver.,,, While using the infoot greatly compromises power, it more than compensates with great accuracy. This techniques is especially useful when all that separates you and your teammate is one opponent, and you need to get the ball over the opponent. In case you need to send it out far, position yourself a bit farther from the ball, and make the contact when it is about 10 cm (4"") off the ground."
"
Consider using the technique of many wingers who are new to crossing—raise a ball a bit before taking the ball into the air.,
Start with the ball at your feet.,
Raise the ball.,
Cross the ball.",How to Half Volley a Soccer Ball3," Although doing this gives the opponent more time, it is a very charismatic move, and is also precise., You need to start the run when you're in the final third, otherwise you will not have enough space, especially if you're new to the technique., While controlling the ball with light touches, put your intoe at the base of the ball (like you do in a lob pass), and push the ball slightly upwards, with small force., The final move is similar to that of the midfielder, except that you will be using your lower laces (the base of your foot), at an approximate 20°, and your kicking foot will be facing the ""D"" (wherever you want the cross to go)."
"
Be prepared to take advantage of the opportunity.,Align yourself in a way such that your kicking foot is right behind the ball.,Position your entire body behind the ball, and lean forward slightly.,
Strike the ball's face (the part that is facing you) using your laces when the ball is about 15cm (8"") off the ground for a straight shot.,Follow through by letting your feet come back down in a parabolic arc.,Celebrate if you have scored!",How to Half Volley a Soccer Ball4," This situation comes up mostly when your team takes a corner, and the opposition clears half-heartedly. If, by a stroke of luck, the ball falls exactly at your feet, take full advantage of the opportunity. There is no need for a run up in this case.,,,

Use your outfoot for a curved shot.

Do sprint drills to raise your maximum speed.Training to reach high speeds within relatively short distances can increase your top speed.,
Do acceleration drills.The ability to accelerate quickly is critical in soccer, and often more important than a high maximum speed.,
Use a speed ladder.Training with a speed ladder will increase your speed, lower body agility, balance, and coordination.,
Try interval training.To use speed effectively on the field, you will have to get used to using bursts of speed interspersed within other movements.,
Train to improve reaction speed.Being fast on the field isn’t just about running speed—it’s also about your ability to change your movement, speed, or technique quickly and frequently.,
Extend your joints.,
Practice ball exercises.,
Warm up.,
Do speed training first.Speed training should be the first part of a practice session (after warm ups).,
Do both plyometric and weight lifting exercises.Speed training in soccer focuses on building strength and endurance.,
Take a rest day.Speed training takes a lot out of you.,
Focus on technique, then speed.It is no use building up speed when you are doing a technique or exercise wrong.",How to Get Faster for Soccer," Sprint drills are an easy way to accomplish this.


Run at top speed for 20-30 meters.
Make sure that your arm action is smooth and relaxed during the exercise. Keep your arms close to your body.Focus on making smooth, even strides, with your knees high.
Keep your head relaxed and in a natural position.
Slow jog or walk back to your starting point when finished with the sprint.
Do 2-4 repetitions of this drill.;
, Acceleration drills will make you build up to and come down from high speeds more efficiently. This type of exercise also helps you work high speeds into other routines. To do a simple acceleration drill:


Jog for 10 yards.
Sprint for 10 yards.
Shift back to jogging for 10 more yards.
Shift back to sprinting for 10 more yards.
Breakdown in 5 yards.
Walk back to your starting point.

, This horizontal tool requires you to alternate your feet across successive rungs as you run. To improve your speed, train with the ladder while using a stopwatch, and work on improving your best time.


Speed ladders are available at many athletic supply stores.

, To accomplish this, do 30 minutes of interval training. Alternate light jogging (5-10 min) with short bursts of more powerful exercises, such as:


Sprints
Running stairs or hills
Ladder drills
Using a ball in combination with any of the above

, To improve your reaction speed, practice while a coach or friend calls (or better, uses a visual signal) for you to change your exercise. Respond as quickly as possible. Try incorporating a combination of exercises like:


Changing direction rapidly when running
Sprinting on command
Playing “Red Light Green Light”


, To accelerate, you will have to extend and use your hip, knees, and ankles.When running or doing other exercises, focus on making long, even strides that stretch out. Increasing your stride length and muscle output in this way will boost your speed.

, While training to increase your speed at moving across the field, do not neglect your control of the ball. Remember that soccer is primarily a sport where the player’s lower body moves in contact with the ground and ball. To be not only fast, but fast and in control of the ball, you must work on your agility.


Dribble at every opportunity, using all parts of your foot (outside, inside, top, and bottom).Do speed dribbling exercises by kicking the ball slightly forward and running after it.
Practice changing direction quickly while dribbling and doing speed dribbling exercises. You can also do this while attempting to evade another player in order to practice using quick dribbles as a way to beat opponents.
Do lateral ball drop exercises. Have a coach or partner hold a ball at shoulder height, 5 meters away from you. When your coach/partner drops the ball, attempt to reach and control the ball before it bounces a second time.

, Always do stretches and short exercises to warm up before beginning a speed training session.This will prepare your mind and body. If you do not properly warm up, you risk injuring yourself.

, Since it utilizes great power and force, you should do speed exercises while you are still fresh. Otherwise, you might not be able to reach and push your speed potential.

, In addition to exercises that aim to improve your time, try doing plyometric (explosive) exercises and weight training, such as:


Jumps
Squats
Burpees
Bench press
Lifts
Leg curls

, It is very important that you take a day to rest between practice sessions. If you try to train for speed while you are sore or fatigued, you will be unsuccessful and risk injuring yourself.

, Make sure that you have a fundamental knowledge of and good practice with soccer skills before attempting to increase your speed. Focus on doing things the right way, then on becoming faster at them.

Place the butt end of your stick firmly in the palm of your dominant hand.,
Slowly take your non-dominant hand off of the shaft, making sure to keep the stick as vertical as possible.,
Try some tricks!,
Practice!,
Be creative!,
Have no boundaries.,
Try to be versatile.",How to Balance a Lacrosse Stick,";
, Practice for a while on your own, making sure you can keep the stick balanced well before moving on to step 3.

, Sure, you can balance your stick, but anyone can do that!


Backhand: Balancing the stick in your dominant hand's palm, push the stick into the air. In mid-flight, flip your hand over so your stick butt lands on the back of your hand. Remember to push your stick up in such a way that it lands vertically. Also, try to have your hand absorb a little of the impact by moving your hand slightly down as your stick lands.






Around the World: Set up balanced, and start spinning your whole body. You will have to tilt your stick into the turn slightly to keep it balanced. See how many times you can go around the world! Can be done in backhand.






Hand-to-Hand: Balance your stick, then gently hop it to your other hand. See how many times you can go hand to hand! Be careful not to go too fast, or your stick will lose its balance. Can be done backhand.






Piano Fingers: Balance your stick, but on one or two fingers. Better yet, hop your stick from standard position to the very tip of a single finger. Stick butts have a very small flare tip, so you can support the entire stick with the edge of one finger while the whole of the shaft isn't really on top of your finger. Can be done backhand.






The Insult: Balance your stick on the tip of your extended middle finger.






Thumbs Up: Balance your stick on the tip of your vertical, extended thumb.






Fur Elise: Balance the stick on your fingers, quickly moving it between your fingers, as if playing a piano. Can be done backhand.






Foot job: Balance your stick on your foot.






Getting Head: Balance your stick, but with your hand hold the head, keeping the shaft in the air. Can be done backhand.






Tandem: With a friend, go hand to hand between the two of you. Feeling daring? Try it with two sticks! Can be done backhand.






The Flip: Just as it sounds, balance your stick, flip it up in the air, and catch it balanced. Can be done backhand, but only it you're really daring!






Cycle: While balanced, spin your stick by ""hopping"" it while giving it a small amount of radial spin. Go for a 360!







, You won't be great the first time you try! Behind every great trick are a hundred failed attempts.

, Create a trick combo, moving fluidly from one trick to the next. Easier said than done!

, Nothing's keeping you from creating your own signature move.

, Just like shooting and cradling, practice righty and lefty. The Hand-to-Hand, one of the most basic tricks, will be tough if you've never practiced with both hands.

Perfect your first touch, setting yourself up for your next pass, shot, or dribble without pausing.,
Practice close-touch ball handling drills.,
Practice pulling off shots and crosses on the run.,
Pay attention to your ""opposite"" or non-dominant foot.,
Learn to dribble with precise, tight control.,
Learn to hit the ball in different areas to get different spins and shots.",How to Get Better at Soccer1," Your first touch is essential, and this skill is what separates the pros from the amateurs. You need to be able to stop a ball at your feet from the air or from the ground, laying it right in front of you so that your next touch can immediately start the attack. Make sure you learn to ""trap"" the ball with your whole body by:


Close-range one touch passing with a partner. If your very first touch is an accurate pass, defenders will have fits trying to steal the ball from you. You can also practice this by kicking against a wall.
Having a teammate or friend throw or cross a ball in the air You must take only two touches -- one to settle, the other to pass it back to them.
Passing and shooting on the run. Have someone feed you a ball on the run, timing your first touch so that you can pass or shoot on the second touch without breaking stride.;
, Your goal with the following exercises isn't just to get faster, it is to get more precise, learning to control the ball with your entire foot to become a better dribbler, passer, and trapper. Try out these drills, aiming for 100 touches on each foot with each drill:Bounce the ball between your feet, using the insoles to keep the ball between your knees and ""passing"" back and forth as quickly as possible.
Tap the ball rapidly on the top with your toes, working on getting as quick as possible. As you improve. Work on actually rolling the ball slightly with the sole of your toe, focusing on this small, precise touch.
Try the ""in-and-out."" Use the sole of your right foot to roll the ball to the right. Roll your foot all the way over the ball to the right, then use your instep to pass the ball to the left foot. Trap it with the sole of your left and roll it out, repeating the drill with both feet, back and forth., If you've been playing for a while, you generally know how to shoot and cross effectively when the ball isn't moving. But this isn't especially ""lifelike"" in a real game, and you'll be leaps and bounds above the competition once you're accurate and powerful on the move. Luckily, this is an easy skill to practice both alone and with a partner. Simply take a touch, get up to roughly 75% full speed, and then take the shot.


As you get better, pick up the speed. Once you can hit a dead sprint, take a touch, and fire off a shot or cross, you'll be a defender's worst nightmare.
Approach from a variety of angles, from hitting shots while running up the center of the field to working on crosses across your body from the sidelines.
Work on your position's skills. A defender, for example, needs to be able to turn the ball and hit up the field as fast as possible to release pressure from an attack.

, It doesn't matter how good your right foot is when you're up against top defenders, who will learn to quickly force you to your left. Great players are dangerous with both feet, forcing defenders to cover all the options. Don't eliminate half of your body from your arsenal -- make sure you work both feet., The ball should feel like an extension of your foot. Take it into a small area (like the penalty box) and just dribble between the lines, varying your speed with sharp sprints and quick stops. Try out a few moves and use both feet, working until you tire out. Your goal is to get the ball as tight to your feet, at any speed, as possible. You'll make defenders lives much harder, and you can continue training by:


Setting up obstacle courses with flags, cones, or old t-shirts. Make yourself zig-zag, weave, and change directions as fast as you can without losing the ball.

Juggling may seem ""useless"" in a real game, but it is the easiest way to improve your touch on the ball, keeping it close with your entire body. Work on both feet, as well as the length of your touch, alternating tight, small juggles and higher, harder to handle touches.Work on some advanced moves and tricks, as they require precise ball control and give you new offensive tools in games.

, Where and how you hit a ball will greatly change how it travels, and best players have the best ball control. Whether on offense of defense, learning how to use the whole ball greatly increases your options anywhere on the field.


Short and accurate passes usually occur with the inside of your foot. Even precise, mid-level crosses can be hit this way.
Hitting the ball on the outside thirds will cause it to bend if you use your laces. Work on getting under the ball a bit, as if hitting it from a diagonal angle.
You can knuckle the ball by cracking it with laces just below dead center and avoiding a follow-throw, taking away spin and causing the ball to dip unpredictably.
Get under the ball, using the edge between your laces and instep, for a backspin chip, which is good for precise crosses that can't bounce or skip away."

Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing for ease of movement and bring plenty of water. You might also want to use additional training equipment, like shin guards, a towel or a stopwatch.Make sure you’re staying hydrated throughout your workout, especially when it’s hot outside.Practice in a pair of soccer cleats to get used to the feel of maneuvering in them during games.;
, Start by running in place to get your body loosened up. Follow this with a few minutes of light jogging and some sit-ups, air squats or dynamic stretches. This will activate your muscles. Warm up for at least 10 minutes, or longer on early mornings and cold days.Your warmup should be vigorous enough to get your blood pumping and your muscles warm and relaxed.A proper warmup will also help reduce soreness from previous workouts.

, Go through a full-body stretching session. Begin with the legs, hips and ankles, but don’t forget to also limber up your back, shoulders, wrists and neck. Stretching improves your mobility and makes sprains and strains less likely. It's very easy to pull something if you haven’t stretched enough.Hold the stretch in the deepest range of motion you can for several seconds.
The quadriceps and hamstrings are the two biggest muscles in the leg and should receive the most attention while stretching.
Dynamic stretches, or stretching while in motion, mimic the kinds of movements found in soccer. Examples of dynamic stretches are swing kicks, side bends and toe touches., Move on to some basic technical exercises. Useful handling drills include dribbling, juggling and passing to yourself. These exercises dial in your focus, coordination and reaction time by forcing you to keep your eye on the ball.Work on ball handling for 10-15 minutes at the beginning and end of each practice session.
Equipment like ropes and cones will allow you to map out your handling drills more effectively.

, Go at a moderate pace until you start to get tired, then take a short rest break before resuming your run. You can also structure your run in intervals, running for 3-4 minutes, walking or resting for 2-3 minutes, then running for another 3-4 minutes and so on. By running frequently and increasing your distance over time, you’ll develop the endurance you need to keep you in the game.Running laps on a track can help you keep up with your time and distance. Schools, churches and recreation centers sometimes open their tracks for community use.
While running for distance, concentrate on your form and breathing rather than speed.

, Sprints are essential for being a successful soccer player, as they require high levels of power and control. Measure out a set distance (it’s best to start with a distance between 30-50 meters) and get into a starting position. When you’re ready, explode forward and run to the endpoint as fast as you can.Since sprints are extremely tiring, they should be scheduled at the beginning of the workout right after your warmup.
As your fitness improves, you can work up to greater distances like the 100 or 200 meter sprint. Longer sprints bridge the gap between intensity and endurance., While speed and agility are key attributes in soccer, it’s also important to be strong. Be sure to incorporate regular muscular exercise into your routine. You can employ calisthenics like pushups, pull ups, air squats and lunges, or lift weights if you have access to a gym. Try to do some form of resistance exercise every other day.Bodyweight exercises can be performed almost anywhere, which means you won’t need to rely on any specialized equipment.When lifting weights, keep the intensity high and number of repetitions low to build strength., You use the muscles of your core to run, stop, change direction and shoot, so pay special attention to them. Sit ups, crunches, leg lifts, V-ups and bicycles are all excellent exercises for strengthening the core. Try to do half an hour of core training at least twice a week. This can come near the end of practice or serve as its own separate workout.Squeeze your stomach tightly throughout the movement to get the most out of each exercise.Work on your core and your returns at the same time by heading a ball tossed by a friend at the top of each sit up.

, Suicides combine explosive power with the dexterity. Set down markers at regular distances going down the field or track. Sprint from your starting point to the first marker, then immediately turn around and return to the start. From there, sprint to the second marker, then back to the start, then to the third marker and so on.When you're first getting the hang of suicides, run through one full circuit, then pause to catch your breath. Work up to the point where you can complete multiple circuits without stopping.
A few rounds of suicides are enough to wear out even the most experienced players, so try not to overdo it.

, Stand with one foot on the ground and bring your other knee up to waist level. In one smooth motion, lower your raised foot to the ground and quickly lift the opposite knee. High knees teach you to pick your feet up higher when you run, making your steps more springy and preventing you from getting tripped up. They're also a good dynamic core exercise.You can perform high knees for time, a set distance or simply as a warmup.

, Stretch out the agility ladder on a flat patch of ground, then run from one end to the other using different footwork patterns. Make sure you only set your feet down in the open spaces between the rungs. The agility ladder calls for precise foot placement and increased concentration, which will both come in handy during a scrimmage.For example, you could span the ladder by shuffling sideways, skip every other rung or use alternating steps and leaps like in hopscotch.
Run rounds on the agility ladder in between other drills and exercises.

, At the end of your workout, cool down by taking a few free shots at the goal or another target. Shoot from different angles and positions to simulate the conditions of an actual game. Kicking is one of the most fundamental skills in soccer, so there’s no substitute for old fashioned repetition.Aiming at a small target, like a goal post or a square tacked to the net, can help you refine your accuracy.Complete a minimum of 30 kicks with each leg. Learning to shoot with both legs will make you more versatile.

Consider enrolling your child in a local children's soccer team.",How to Introduce Soccer to a Child," Buy a small size ball at first (sizes 2 or 3). Owning their own soccer ball will provide a great incentive to use it and to play around with kicking it in the home environment, thereby encouraging practice.;
, This will help your child to associate it with a fun occasion, seeing it as a gift and an opportunity to learn something new. It also carries the respect of being a gift.

, When you are watching soccer on the TV, encourage your child to watch it too. This way they will get an idea of the play and it's a perfect opportunity for you to explain what is happening and to start teaching some of the rules and cool moves.


Ask your child if he or she has a favorite player––if so, you could do some research online about that player and even print out some pictures to use as posters on the wall in your child's room.

, You can use this to teach the basic rules to your child in the comfort of your home environment.


Teach how to pass the ball by asking how to pass to an object.
Teach how to juggle with a light ball. This helps develop ball control.
If you find that your child isn't kicking the ball correctly, explain it slowly and show how it is done. You can also use YouTube videos to assist your explanations.

, Children differ in their attention spans and level of interest. Tailor your teaching to what you know about your child; if you feel frustrated, it's time to take a break because you mustn't take this out on your child. Always keep the training times enjoyable and encouraging, so as to not make soccer seem like a chore.


Always maintain a good relationship and train regularly.
Don't pretend that a child has amazing skills when it's clear that he or she needs to practice a great deal. Overconfidence is as much a burden as a lack of confidence. Seek a fine balance.

, This is a really sure-fire way to encourage your child to be eager to play.

, When it's clear that your child enjoys playing soccer at home and is enthusiastic about the game as a whole, ask whether he or she would like to get involved in playing as part of a team. If so, check out several different clubs to see which clicks the best, and enroll your child.


Be sure to go along to practice sessions, to encourage your child. He or she will let you know when they're okay to be there without you.

Learn one on one defending to be useful anywhere on the field.,
Keep your eyes up throughout the game, especially when you have the ball.,
Communicate on the field, talking constantly to aid your team.,
Watch professional games at least once a week, learning from the best.,
Learn the basics of team tactics, becoming a team leader on offense and defense.",How to Get Better at Soccer2," From strikers to centre-backs, everyone needs to know individual defending. So get a partner and start playing 1v1, working on handling your man and pressuring him effectively. When defending one on one, remember to:


Stay slightly crouched and on the balls of your feet. Your knees should be bent in an athletic position, allowing you to react quickly.
Angle your body, with one foot ahead of the other, so that you invite the attacker to go to one side. Force them to the sideline, or to your other defenders, instead of standing straight up and letting them choose your direction.
Watch a player's hips to avoid getting tricked. Your hips are your center of gravity, and they generally telegraph where a player is going unless they're Lionel Messi. It is almost impossible to quickly change your hips direction, and you can use this to your advantage as a defender., Great players are always scanning the field, especially when they have the ball. This takes practice, as it's harder to control a ball you can see. But learning to use the bottom of your eyesight while scanning the field is an essential skill to become a smarter, and thus better, player.


Use practices to work on keeping your head up. Turn the ball over now, not in games, and you'll quickly see improvement., Great players are always talking: ""Open man,"" ""I've got ball,"" ""I need some help,"" and much, much more is constantly being shouted on the field, and there is a good reason. Soccer is a team game, and intelligent players know the team must be on the same page for all 90 minutes to get the most out of the game. Be a team leader and start chattering every game and practice. Essential things to talk about throughout the game include:



Defensive Marks: let your team know who you're covering, if you want to challenge the ball, and if there are any unmarked defenders who need to be covered.

Advice to the player dribbling: don't shout tons of info at them, but don't leave them in the dark. Tell them when they have time and when there is a ""man on.""

Making Runs: Tell your teammate you're ""overlapping!"" or that ""you can play it back"" if they need. When you make a big run, don't assume they will always see you, especially if their head is down., Note where the players are not just when they have the ball, but off of it. What runs are people in your position making? When do they move up to attack and when do they peel back. Don't be afraid to be a bit of a critic -- use these games to learn new ideas and break down why certain things didn't work. How would you play differently, and how would you like to emulate your favorite players?Burgeoning players can also check out tutorials, clips, and highlights on Youtube, which can help fill in gaps if you're unsure what techniques the pros are using on shots or passes.
Find a team or league you love and become a fan -- the more you watch the better your play will be.

, A big part of soccer intelligence is learning how to work as a team. While each team has specific strategies that they must develop together, there are some tactics that hold true no matter what team you're on:



Contract on defense, expand on offense. This is the basis of all strategies -- you want to take away space on defense and create space when attacking. So, on defense, you come together near the center of the field, forming a unified base. On offense, you try to make them break this base by stretching out to defend you and your team.

Follow up all shots, forcing the defense to react. Even decent shots can turn into goals if your team is crashing the goal on shots and crosses. This sort of pressure can upend defenses, as defenders will face their own goal on a rebound and have a very hard time clearing it safely.

Keep your shape defensively. Even if you're not playing an offside trap, the defense should be on a horizontal line, holding shape. When defenses lose this shape, they create gaps and hole between themselves. If you play in the back. Always look left and right and keep everyone in a mostly even line.

"
"
Try out and play for the best teams you can find.,
Get fit for your position to get the most out of training.,
Keep moving off the ball, not just when you may receive it.,
Take every practice seriously, working on your weak spots.,
Play and make decisions as quickly as possible.,
Search out advice, guidance, and coaching on your weak areas.",How to Get Better at Soccer3," There are no shortcuts to being a better soccer player other than playing as much as you can. That said, you'll get much better much faster if you're up against the toughest competition you can handle. Try out for a team that pushes you, or, if that's not possible, make challenges for yourself. Go join the local adult pick-up game (just bring cleats and jump on the field,) get your teammates to play with you in the offseason, and keep practicing alone when there is no one to join you.If you have no players around to jump in with, go shoot against a wall, pass back and forth with a fence, or juggle and work on your tricks in the backyard., While all soccer players need to train to get the most out of their play, all players need to train differently. By thinking about your position's specific needs you can get the most out of your body and be the biggest asset to your team.



Goalies: Focus on your strength, reaction time, and a slim, quick figure that can move in an instant.

Defenders: Must be physically strong, both upper body and lower, to win any tackle or challenge. Need great sprinting speed as well, and should be fit.

Midfielders: Must be able to run and run and run. Quick decision making, and the touch and passing ability to back it up, are essential.

Forwards: Should be fast and able to jostle with strong defenders. They also tend to be endurance runners, able to jog around all game to make space and still win a sprint to the end line.

, Great soccer players rarely stand still. As defenders, you are constantly shutting down space and reacting to the offense. As a midfielder, you're constantly scanning the field and moving to the ball, opening up space in the middle. As a striker, you're constantly trying to outfox a defender, slipping by them or disappearing when they are ball watching. You must always be moving, keeping the field open and dynamic and the other team guessing -- standing still makes you almost useless to your team.


Check to the ball, even if you don't get it. As soon as you appear, demand the ball, but leave immediately if you don't get it. You'll have a defender following you, which opens up the space you were just in for your team.
Spread wide when your team gets the ball if you play near a wing -- a quick counterattack to the sidelines often has the most space to push forward.
If you don't have a man to mark, fill in the space an attacker might want. Try to figure out the most dangerous passing lanes to goal and sit in them, clogging them for the other team., Practice is the time to get over your weaknesses, not impress your teammates. Treat each practice like a warm-up for a huge game, working yourself hard in every drill and testing out new moves now so that they become second-nature in a game.


Play multiple positions -- improve as both a shooter and a defender
Focus on both feet -- no one cares if you turn it over now, but they do care in games.
Play quickly in practice especially. Don't slow down or take it light, even if your defenders are putting less than game pressure on you.

, Scouts and coaches look a lot at your pace of play -- how fast you receive the ball, look up, and pass/shoot/dribble. Don't hold onto the ball too long, and practice making quick, decisive decisions on the ball, pushing yourself to play with urgency. Good ways to do so include:


Pass the ball and keep moving. A few quick touches are usually enough, as the ball moves much faster than you can run. The longer you're in the same area, the longer the defense has to shut down holes and get set.
If you plan to dribble, do so at a good quick pace instead of slowly. Put the defenders on the back foot.
Look for crosses, especially ones that force the defenders to face their own goal. Big passes force a defense to scramble into new positions quickly, which often opens up holes., No matter how much better at soccer you get, you'll never be a perfect player. Soccer requires 11 players in complete unison to succeed, so keep your ears open to your coaches and mentors. Each player has specific weaknesses they can work on -- don't close your ears to your own.Ask your coach what you can do to get better a few times a season. How can you work on your own skills outside of practice?
Consider calling in a personal coach or trainer to work on the skills you don't have time for in practice. If you really want to excel, especially in an area without high-level teams, you'll need the individual attention.

Start early.,
Decide whether to specialize.,
Play at the varsity level.,
Play at the junior varsity level.,
Play for private clubs.",How to Get a Soccer Scholarship1," By high school, you should have years of playing under your belt. Most soccer players begin playing in children’s leagues and progress through playing on school teams and for private clubs.


It is rare that a skilled soccer player will begin playing the sport for the first time in their teenage years, but it is not impossible.
The more that you are able to train and practice, the better you will get. Some people are naturally talented at soccer, but becoming a skilled player requires hard work.;
, Many soccer athletes grew up playing other sports and continue to play on teams when soccer is not in season. You have the ability to decide whether you want to specialize in soccer (and not play other sports) or continue to be a multi-sport athlete.There are benefits to playing other sports while seeking a soccer scholarship. Practicing and training during the soccer offseason can keep you in good physical shape and can strengthen certain skills. For example, running on the track team can be a beneficial way to strengthen your running abilities on the soccer field.
You do run the risk of injury when you play a physical sport (like football) during the soccer offseason.
By playing multiple sports, you may begin to feel overworked and become distracted in the scholarship process.

, When you enter high school, you will need to try out for the school’s team. Most schools will have a junior varsity and a varsity team. High school teams will host tryouts and determine which team a player will participate on. It is best to begin playing at the varsity level as early as you can. You are more attractive to recruiters and college coaches if you’ve played on the varsity team for four years rather than one or two.


Tryouts are open to all grades and to all skill levels. As a skilled player, you need to stand out from these other players to be selected.
Varsity level soccer teams can vary greatly in their skill levels and competitiveness. Your high school may not have a very strong soccer program or they may be well known as a competitive team.
It is easier to standout if you are on a less competitive team, but you are less likely to be noticed by recruiters if you do not play for a well-known and competitive high school.

, If you go through tryouts and are selected for the junior varsity team, you can still be a competitive recruit for a soccer scholarship. Use this as an opportunity build a relationship with your coach and to fine tune your skills.


Junior varsity players have room to grow and develop their skills before they are ready to play at the varsity level.
Play at your best level on the junior varsity team to improve your chances of making the varsity team the next year.

, Club soccer leagues are available in most areas. They give athletes an opportunity to play soccer competitively during the offseason when they do not play for a school team.Club soccer is a good way to increase your visibility to recruiters, especially if your high school team is not very competitive.
Club soccer coaches often have connections to college coaches, just as your high school coach would. Use them as a resource to make connections with college coaches and to get your name out.

Assign a player who will always inbound the ball.,
Assign other roles.,
Keep one player in the middle of the court.,
Send your players deep.,
Keep calm when you see the defense enter the full court press.,
Get the ball in-bounds quickly.,
Run the baseline if your opponent just scored.,
Inbound the ball to your best passer.,
Face your defender.,
Scan the court for open players.,
Make quick, smart passes.,
Get the ball to the hoop.,
Beat the press after a missed shot.,
Scout the opposing team ahead of time.",How to Break a Full Court Press," When you designate a player specifically for inbounding the ball, he or she can perfect that technique. They’ll know where to look and how to run the baseline effectively.Having the same player take the ball out every time will help your team move more quickly because they won’t have to figure out who’s turn it is to take the ball out.;
, Speed is the most important thing in a press break offense, because you may be low on game time and you want to catch the defense off guard. Tell each player what spot to get to when the play starts.


If the players know ahead of time where to go, they can get to that spot quicker than if they all have to figure it out every time you run the press break.
You could have one player stay close to the person who will get the ball first to be backup in case the player needs to pass it before they can get to half court.
The last two players can stack one in front of the other at the free throw line when the play begins and split off toward each sideline once the ball is at half court.

, One the defense’s goals with a press is to trap the ball along the sidelines or in the corners, so make sure one player stays in the middle of the court at all times.This ensures that your players always have an option if the ball gets stuck on the sideline.
You can keep the same player in the middle all the time, or you can have players rotate into the middle position. It may be good to decide on a specific rotating order so everyone knows when it is their turn to take the middle spot.

, In a full court press, multiple defenders may cover the person with the ball to put more pressure on them. This leaves an offensive player open who can go deep on the court and look for a pass.


It can be risky, but if you do have a player wide open at the end of the court, this can be a good opportunity for a lob pass all the way down the court. You may want to practice this type of passing ahead of time.

, The goal of a full court press is to get you flustered so you turn the ball over. When you know the press is coming, keep calm and know your plan of attack. Don’t let mistakes distract you. Keep your head in the game and keep the ball moving.A well designed plan for attacking the press will have a significant impact on staying calm. Go over the press break offense often so you never forget how it works.
Have a player call out “press break!” when they see it coming so that all players can get to their positions.

, The longer you keep the ball out of bounds, the longer the defense has to set up their press. If you can inbound the ball quickly then you put some of the pressure back on them.


If you are the designated inbounder, always remember to grab the ball quickly after the other team scores and get into position, ready to pass.
If you are typically the first player in-bounds to get the ball, start moving and watch for the pass.

, Where you throw the ball in-bounds from is important, so whenever possible pick a spot between the basket and the corner. You don’t want to get trapped in either one. Learn to move back and forth to shake your defender.If you are inbounding because the ball went out of bounds (rather than after a score), the referee will hand it to you and you don’t have the option of moving. Don’t commit a turnover by moving when you aren’t allowed to.
Learn to move along the baseline in a way that you can easily pass the ball around the defender who is guarding you.
Don’t just run back and forth aimlessly, but move purposefully looking for your opening.

, If you can set up your press break offense so that the best passer on the team is always the first to get the ball, you’ll be able to move the play ahead smoothly. Get the ball into the best passer’s hands and then let them pass it quickly.


One this player gets the ball, they should get past half court quickly, as you only have 10 seconds to do this. Once they are past half court, they should look for the next pass.

, When you are up against a full court press, you never want to turn your back to the defender who is guarding you. This immediately allows them to close the distance between you and them. It also takes away your ability to see your teammates and watch for an opening.Stay in a nice low stance that allows you to dribble when necessary and easily pivot once you stop moving.
Keep your free hand up to keep the defender from getting too close to the ball.
If you can safely switch the ball from hand to hand, you’ll have more options when you see an open teammate.

, Since passing is crucial to breaking the press, knowing where your teammates are and who is open is important. Never watch the ball as you dribble. Keep your defender in sight but don’t focus on them.


You need to find a groove of scanning quickly enough that you see everyone but slowly enough that you notice when someone is open.
Don’t play favorites of who you want to pass it to. Get the ball to the player who is in the best position to make the play.

, You won’t typically beat the press by dribbling, so focus on moving the ball from player to player as quickly as possible. When you have to dribble, do it for a short amount of time while you look for the next opening.Quick passes mean getting rid of the ball as soon as you see an open player. Smart passes mean seeing potential defenders who could steal the pass and avoiding them.

, Your main objective is still to score points, so once the immediate pressure if off, focus back in on the main point. Once the ball is across the half court line, pass it to your best shooter and either have them drive to the basket, or take a jump shot from where they are.


Passing the ball from player to player is good to find the right opportunity, but if the defense is running a full court press then you are probably limited on time.
Try to keep it to 2-4 passes total for the play. One pass to get it inbounds. One to get it across half court, or after half court. And 1-2 passes to get it to a player who can score.

, Sometimes you’ll go on offense after the opponent misses a shot, so you won’t be throwing the ball inbounds. The player who rebounds should begin to dribble down the court while everyone else sprints down ahead of them.The rebounder should be looking to make a good pass as soon as possible.
The difference here is that the clock will not stop for you to take it out of bounds. Plus, the player will be passing from somewhere in the backcourt or dribbling down the court.
You may not be able to control which player pulls down the rebound, but you can plan to have your best ball handler hang back so the rebounder can pass it to them.

, One of the best attacks for a press is knowing when it’s coming. Many teams will consistently run the same format of full court press, so knowing this ahead of time will help you prepare for it come game time.If you are able to watch game film, you can try to isolate the times in the game when the team is most likely to enter the full court press. You may find they do it frequently. If so, you can drill your team on attacking the press successfully.

Watch a lot of basketball.,
Research simple offensive and defensive sets.,
Ask other youth basketball coaches for advice.,
Develop a philosophy.",How to Coach Youth Basketball1," The best coaches are also great students of the game. Find basketball games wherever you can—on television, online, or down at the local recreation center—and study them. Identify what plays or systems work best and which ones are less effective. Take plenty of notes, and go over them when the game is finished.;
, The key to being an effective youth basketball coach is recognizing the limitations of your students. The majority of young players will only be able to memorize and execute a limited number of plays. Additionally, fundamentals are more important to youth development than the execution of certain plays. Find a few easy offensive and defensive plays you can run, and study them until you have them mastered.

, If you decide to watch some games in person, approach the coaches after the game and set up a time to speak with them about any questions or ideas you may have.

, Once you’ve researched the basics, you should decide what kind of coach you want to be. Consider the following questions:



What are my primary coaching goals? Do I want to take young players with little experience and make them better? Would I prefer coaching players with some experience and guiding them to the next level?

What do I want my players to learn? What are the most important drills or lessons I can teach? If time is a factor, what drills or lessons can I omit? Is there a specific area—stamina, hand-eye coordination, lateral quickness—that I want to work on instead of others?

How important is winning? Will my players learn the same lessons in defeat that they will in victory? Do I make decisions based primarily on allowing all my players to develop their skills, or do I coach to win?

How will I measure my success? Are my players better than they were when I started? How much better? Are they satisfied with their progress? Did they have fun?

"
"
Decide what type of college experience you want to have.,
Set appropriate goals.,
Set academic goals.,
Talk to your coaches.,
Talk to other players.,
Look at team rankings.,
Make a list of schools.",How to Get a Soccer Scholarship2," Playing a sport in college is a big commitment. At top ranked schools, you will be playing and practicing nearly every day of the week. While in season, you will be traveling and missing classes for games.


The majority of soccer teams are regulated under the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which has three divisions. Only Division I and Division II schools are eligible to offer athletic scholarships; you can narrow your search to these schools.Players on Division III teams can earn academic and merit scholarships, but these will not constitute soccer scholarships.

, This takes self-reflection and being honest with yourself about your abilities. Playing for a top ranked college is not going to be feasible if your soccer skills are not at an exceptionally high level. Playing soccer at a college level is a huge commitment and if you are not 100% committed to playing, you will not succeed.


Setting goals that are appropriate to your skill level can save you from heartache and disappointment down the line.
Within Division I and Division II schools, colleges vary on their competitiveness. Look at the current college soccer rankings to identify schools that are more competitive than others., Even though you want to play soccer for this college, you are also there to get an education. The colleges that you apply to should fit your academic goals and be a good fit for you outside of soccer.


Again, these goals should be realistic and reflective of your academic abilities. Colleges set academic requirements for their athletes and if you fall below this grade point average you can be suspended from the team. If you are an exceptional student, you will have more opportunities available.

, Talk with your high school and club coach about your skill level, your potential to win a scholarship, and where you can improve. Be candid and open with your coaches about your goals to win a scholarship and ask for their help.


Your coaches will most likely have established relationships with some colleges and recruiters. The number of contacts that your coach will have can vary widely, but they can get your foot in the door.
Ask them what skills and areas you can improve on. Even the best soccer player can fine tune their skills and improve their consistency. Your coaches can help you identify the areas you are weak in so you can improve before playing in front of recruiters.

, Talk to other players that you know who have gone through this process and players that are now collegiate athletes. Ask them about their experiences and for advice on the process. Consider asking them questions like:


What has your experience playing soccer in college been like?
What were the most challenging parts of the recruiting process?
What do you wish you had known about the process before you had started it?

, Men and women’s teams are ranked based off of their win-loss record and performance in tournaments. If you want to focus your search to the most competitive schools, you should aim to be recruited by schools that are in the top 25 of the nation. Men’s and women’s teams are ranked separately. You may find that some schools have stronger men’s programs than women’s or vice versa., Based on your goals, your coaches’ input, and your skill level, you can begin to identify schools that you are most interested in. This list of schools should include the name of the soccer coach and their contact information. Most schools will have a website devoted to their athletic program where you can find this information.


Your list of schools should be large in the beginning of your process and become narrowed down over time. "
"
Meet academic scholarship requirements.,
Meet the college's academic requirements.,
Hire a tutor, if needed.,
Be mindful of social media.,
Make good choices.",How to Get a Soccer Scholarship3," You must meet certain academic requirements to win a soccer scholarship. Once you are in college, you will need to continue to meet these requirements to maintain the scholarship.The grade point average requirements for a soccer scholarship depend on the school. For example, an Ivy League school will have higher score requirements than most other schools.
Even as a star recruit, if you do not meet the academic standards set by the school you will not be eligible for a scholarship.

, Now that you have a list of schools that you are interested in being recruited by, you will need to make sure that you are a strong applicant to the school. Like all college applicants, potential student athletes are required to meet the standards that the school has set for their admitted students. These will most likely include a threshold for your grade point average, your scores on standardized tests, strong recommendation letters, and application essays.


Most universities include this information on their websites. Look for admitted student profiles and statistics about the academic scores of their most recent students. A guidance counselor at your high school can also help you find this information.

, If your grades or standardized test scores do not meet the eligibility requirements for a soccer scholarship, you need to raise your grade point average. A tutor can help you target areas that you struggle with and give one on one support.


A writing tutor can help you to strengthen your application essays and personal statements.
If you are struggling in a particular class or subject, ask your teacher for additional help.

, Social media has changed the way that high school students are accepted to college and how athletes are recruited. Keep your social media profiles private but be aware that you may be found through your friend’s profiles.Never post content on your social media that can be interpreted as discriminatory. As a college athlete, you will represent your university. Universities do not want to recruit young athletes who could jeopardize the school’s reputation. This can disqualify you as a recruitment candidate.

, During the recruiting process, you will be evaluated as a person and not just as an athlete. Coaches want to know that you are able to fit in on a team and that you follow the law.


Do not drink alcohol underage. Never post pictures or content on your social media profiles that suggest that you are drinking alcohol underage.
Do not use any illegal drugs. Beyond risking criminal conviction, you may be drug tested before a college will finalize your soccer scholarship.

Make a video.,
Make a recruiting profile.,
Reach out to coaches.,
Follow up.,
Do your research.,
Attend showcase camps.,
Play at your highest level.",How to Get a Soccer Scholarship4," A highlight video or a video that showcases your quality skills can help you stand out among other applicants. If your club or high school films your games, reach out to your coaches for access to these videos. If they do not, you will need to invest in a quality camera and have a friend or family member film you. The film should include your game highlights and some of your best plays. You can also include footage of yourself showcasing your skills during practice or alone.Keep the video relatively short. As a general rule, they should be less than ten minutes. If a coach wants to see more film, they will ask you for it.
Put this video online and attach a link to the video in your resume.

, There are a number of websites, like BeRecruited and Top Drawer Soccer, that are dedicated to high school recruitment for NCAA sports. You can make a profile on these sites to increase your exposure. These profiles include your soccer stats, high school, height, weight, and soccer awards.


Recruiters may look at these profiles to get a general understanding of your skill level based on your statistics and rewards.
This should be done as a complimentary part of your recruiting process and cannot replace directly contacting coaches.

, Check with your current coach to see if they have contacts with any of the schools on your list. Send an introductory email or letter to coaches of teams that you are interested in.


Your introductory email or letter should include your name, high school, graduation year, and contact information. Let the coach know that you are interested in playing for their team and why you think you would be a good fit on the team.
You should include a professional resume that contains detailed statistics from your past seasons of club and high school play. Include a copy of your high school transcript and standardized test scores as well. Be sure to include a link to the highlight reel that you have filmed.

, Respond to every coach that responds to your initial email. These early stages of correspondence are very important in establishing a relationship with the coach.


If you do not hear from a coach after two weeks, reach out to them again.
Never ignore an email or phone call from a coach, regardless of whether you are interested in the school or not. You never know how the recruiting process will go and you will want to maintain positive relationships with different teams.

, Coaches receive hundreds, or thousands, of letters from high school players who want to play at the college level. If a coach is interested, they may contact your club or high school coach to act as an intermediary. To show them that you are interested in their team, you should be familiar with the school and the team history.During your correspondence with coaches, show that you are familiar with the team and that you are interested in attending that college for a reason.

, Colleges often host developmental or showcase athletic camps to attract top-level players from across the country. Recruiters will be attending these camps and will also use this as an opportunity to assess players’ skills. These camps are predominantly offered in the summer and soccer offseason.


Be friendly with the other people at the camp. While you all may be competing for the same scholarships, you want to demonstrate that you are a team player and someone who can get along with teammates.

, You will attract attention from recruiters when you are succeeding on the field. Play at your highest level in your varsity and club games and become a standout player on your team. Treat every practice and game seriously as a way to improve your skills and your chances of being recruited. Play the best game that you can every time and play as if the coach from your top choice school was watching you.


Keep track of your record, your statistics, and any awards that you win.
Update college coaches if you have a significant accomplishment they would be interested in, like your varsity team winning your state league."

Introduce yourself.,
Ask your players to do the same.,
Find out where your players prefer to play, and see how flexible they are.",How to Coach Youth Basketball2," Letting your players know who you are is a necessary first step, and it shouldn’t be limited to a name. Tell the kids where you’re from, what your background is, how much basketball you play or played, and why you decided to get into coaching. Most importantly, tell them what your plans are—not only for yourself, but for them. Young athletes need direction, and the sooner you lay out your vision, the more likely they are to latch on from the get-go.

, It may be unrealistic to expect the same amount of detail from each of the kids you’ll be coaching, but encouraging them to share information about themselves will not only make the rest of the group feel comfortable, it will provide you with more of a sense of what each of the players is about.

, It’s important for kids to feel comfortable out on the court, and giving them a chance to play their preferred position is a good way to accomplish that. But it certainly couldn’t hurt to find out if anyone is willing or interested in trying different positions. Youth basketball should always be about fun first. If a player doesn’t want to switch, that should always be his or her choice.

"
"
Be positive, especially when pointing out a mistake.,
Celebrate any progress.,
Keep everyone active.,
Involve everyone.,
Keep things relaxed.,
Use proportional equipment, if possible.,
Have—and teach—fun.",How to Coach Youth Basketball3," Children are sensitive when it comes to dealing with criticism. A good youth basketball coach can introduce ways of improving a skill without detracting from the fun of the sport. Do not feel like you have to point out every mistake a player makes; focus on areas where you see room for improvement, and always put a positive spin on it.

, Positive reinforcement is a great motivator, especially if you’re coaching kids with limited basketball experience. Be sure to select drills that will allow players to see their development themselves. A free-throw shooting drill in which kids take five shots each is a perfect example of this kind of exercise. A player might only make one basket at first but, in time, he or she will start to become more proficient and will be encouraged by the progress since it is easy to track.

, When deciding between two plays or systems, always select the one that involves more movement. Simple motion offenses—featuring sequences that involve plenty of off-the-ball movement—are ideal for young players since they require constant action from everyone. Give your players a workout. It will increase their stamina and help them figure out how to get open for easy shots.

, You may be inclined to spend more time on a particular player’s struggles, but it is important to ensure that all of your players are given some attention. If you want to work with a player on a particular skill, have the others engage in a fun game that you can track while you do your individual work. Avoid situations that could be construed as favoritism. Balance is critical to keeping a group of young players satisfied.

, Certain offensive and defensive setups require a great deal of hard work. Fast breaks on the offensive end and presses on the defensive end are two good examples of strategies that should be left to older groups. The more laid back the atmosphere, the more likely the players you coach will want to remain part of the team and improve.

, Some young athletes can play on the same playing fields as the adults do. Young basketball players should not. Forcing a four-foot child to shoot on an adult-sized hoop is only going to discourage him or her. Track down equipment sized proportionally to your players, and you will have a much easier time teaching them proper form and technique.

, Select fun drills and games to play. Bring a high level of energy to every practice or play session. Dole out high fives as often as you can. If it isn’t fun, you aren’t doing it right.

Make it through preliminary evaluations.,
Have secondary evaluations.,
Receive offers.,
Negotiate your offer, if possible.,
Accept your offer.",How to Get a Soccer Scholarship5," Once a coach has identified potential recruits, they begin reviewing these athletes more closely. They will verify your highlight reel and your statistics with your club and high school coaches. They will also verify your high school transcript with your school.


At this stage it is important to have all of your information organized. Coaches want to see that potential recruits are taking this process seriously and are able to follow up with them with the information that they request.

, This is the stage where coaches or the recruiters they work with will come to watch you play. They may invite you on official or unofficial visits of the university and contact your family members. Coaches want to see that you are an upstanding young person who is responsible, a team player, committed to soccer, and interested in their university.
During this time, you will need to spend time visiting the schools and meeting other players on the team. Continue to build your relationship with the college coach and emphasize that you are very interested in playing for them.

, Coaches that are interested in offering you a scholarship at this stage will extend verbal or formal written commitments. Depending on the school, you may receive this offer through your high school or club coach. You may have room to negotiate the terms of the offer but you should review them carefully.


Read over each offer very carefully with your parents and coaches. There may be terms for the offer, like maintaining a certain grade point average or participating in a training camp before school starts, that you have to understand and follow.

, Unless you are a top recruit at one of the best Division I schools, you will probably be unable to negotiate any offer you receive. If there are some specific terms that you can negotiate, proceed cautiously. Teams have been known to pull offers from athletes that they believe to be too pushy or disrespectful.


If you receive multiple offers, you may be able to leverage one offer against another. Keep in mind that some schools will offer a scholarship for a specific amount, like $20,000 each year, or a percentage, like 50% of tuition. A coach that offers you the highest amount, even if it is not a full ride, is unlikely to up their offer when they hear that schools are offering you less money., Congratulations! You’ve received a soccer scholarship from a team that you’re interested in. At this point, you will sign with the university and accept their soccer scholarship. This is essentially a contract between you and the college agreeing that you will play on their soccer team when you enroll in the school.

People who are chosen for this playoff ticket opportunity will also receive word that they have the opportunity to purchase finals tickets at face value after their team qualifies for the finals.

, Each team will usually announce a plan to sell NBA tickets online, by phone and at their home box office. Tickets are usually sold between 10 days to a week before the first finals game.


You can purchase tickets by cash by waiting in line on the first day of the sale at the home box office, usually located in the home arena. The box office will usually also accept all major credit cards. To purchase these tickets, people may need to wait in line for hours or camp overnight.
Call the number indicated on the press release, to purchase tickets by phone. People must purchase these tickets using major credit cards, and there is no guarantee that the call will go through. Lines may be jammed, so getting through to a ticket agent is partially based on luck. You will need to call at the time indicated by the press release because tickets sell out quickly.
Go online to the official ticket website to purchase NBA finals tickets by credit card. You will need to log on and enter your details at the time indicated by the press release. The site is likely to be busy and tickets will sell quickly.

, These official sites allow season ticket holders to resell their tickets, usually at or below face value, before games. After finals tickets are released, you can go online to the ticket exchange to purchase directly from these ticket holders.

, There are dozens of ticket sites, so ensure there are guarantees for legitimacy and refunds for later games in the series if they are not played. Tickets begin selling approximately 10 days to a week before the event.


Online ticket brokers tend to sell by dynamic pricing. This means that the price for tickets increases based on demand. Buying tickets the day they go on sale is likely to ensure that you will get a set of tickets for the game; however, it may also mean you pay well over face value, because of the large demand.

, As the date nears, ticket prices tend to drop, because unused tickets are worthless to sellers. If you have the ability to wait until a few hours before, you can get tickets for a fraction of the face value price.


Download applications to ticket sites such as StubHub or PreferredSeating so that you can buy tickets before the game remotely. You can choose to pick up the tickets at the ticket broker booths located at the stadium. This option is not available for every ticket site, so do some research if you plan to wait until the last minute.
Buying tickets by ticket broker is always a gamble on price. Prices often drop after you purchase them, yet you are facing the possibility that all tickets will be sold out.

, If you are unable to find tickets on a broker site, you can look for an eBay option. Always pay with PayPal, so that you can dispute the charge if the tickets are fraudulent.

Watch a lot of basketball.,
Research different offensive and defensive sets.,
Ask other basketball coaches for advice.,
Design your own plays.",How to Become a Basketball Coach1," It seems like a simple objective, but it is by far the most important one—and not just for newcomers to the sport. Seeing how the sport is played—less as a fan, and more with an eye toward offensive and defensive setups—can give you a clearer picture of how a coach impacts the game. Study how offenses and defenses adjust to one another. Make note of when substitutions are made. Keep an eye on how players are matched up against each other. Write down everything you see, and study it every chance you get.;
, Coaching strategies are plastered all over the Internet. They range from simple half-court sets to more complicated plays featuring backdoor cuts, swing passes and plenty of movement without the ball. Start by learning some of the basic offensive and defensive plays, with emphasis on player positioning and movement. Once you have those memorized, add more plays to your repertoire. But don’t overdo it. Having a few go-to plays when you’re just starting out is good enough.

, The coaching fraternity is tight-knit, and fellow coaches are usually delighted to talk strategy and share their knowledge of the craft. Take in everything other coaches have to say. Even if you don’t agree with it, there may be some useful nuggets you can employ down the road. Don’t be afraid to ask plenty of questions.

, Every good coach has a handful of plays he has created himself. Even if your designs don’t immediately lead to certain victory, the act of creating plays—either through drawing up something from scratch or by taking an existing strategy and modifying it—is sure to broaden your knowledge base. You can always tinker with things as necessary.

Practice smooth dribbling skills.,
Drill your passes.,
Improve your running speed.,
Pay attention to your teammates.,
Look up before you pass.,
Pass with a firm ball.,
Establish signals with the other players.,
Be patient.,
Study videos of professional assists.",How to Get Assists in Soccer1," Excellent ball control and agility are vital for any soccer player. Practice passing back and forth to your teammates while running. You should learn to pass the ball right in front of a running receiver, so she can easily dribble without interrupting her running.;
, There are many drills you and your team can use to practice passing. As you try these, focus on improving your aim, trying to pass directly in front of the other player's feet. Here are a few drills, ordered from easy to difficult:

When practicing alone, pass against a wall, aiming toward a target on the wall each time.
Set up two cones about 40 feet (12 m) from the goal and an equal distance apart from each other. Form two lines between the cones and pass the ball at least three times between you before one person shoots into the goal.
Practice crossing. One player passes to a second player near a corner, who then crosses in front of the goal as a third player runs up to score.
Repeat the crossing drill, but have a stationary defender attempt to block the cross. Get past him with high ball passes.

, Sprinting is essential if you want to become an assist king. Practice sprinting drills regularly so you can get where you need to be to make the pass., Many players will attempt a goal every time they see a good opportunity. But if there's a teammate ahead of you with a perfect shot, the assist is even better! Stay alert and get in the habit of weighing your options before you act by instinct. You should always have an idea of which players you might get a chance to pass to., One common mistake is assuming the receiver will be in the position you expect from practice. Always look up before you pass so your aim is sure.

Also check your shoulders before you receive the ball so you know who's behind you.

, Passing too lightly can be a disaster, as the ball may not reach the other player with enough speed to lead to a good shot. Passing too hard can make the ball difficult to control, but it's better to kick too hard than too soft.

, This will make coordination much easier. For example, pulling up your socks before a corner kick could alert your teammates that you will be running in toward the net., Setting up assist requires a great deal of patience. Make your move when you see a legitimate opening in the defenses. Do not let boredom or frustration convince you to pass on a low-success shot., Players such as Mesut Ozil, Andrés Iniesta, Riyad Mahrez, and Thomas Muller are phenomenal leaders in getting assists. Watch videos of professional games and pay attention to how they coordinate with their teammates and move with and without the ball to set up the goal."

Ensure a shot has been taken.,
Single out the person you're guarding if you’re playing man-to-man defense.,
Box out the closest person to you if you’re playing a zone defense.,
Trust your team when in a zone defense.,
Position yourself between your opponent and the basket as you anticipate the angle at which the missed shot will venture.It is helpful to quickly glance at the opposing player's eyes.,
Step toward the player.,
Extend an arm and make contact with their torso to ensure that you don't lose track of your opponent.,
Do a reverse (back) pivot into the player.,
Stay balanced, and extend your butt slightly.,
Spread your arms to either side of your opponent behind you at the same time you are pushing him back with your base.,
Push backwards with your butt.,
Watch the ball to try to anticipate where it will go if the shot is missed.,
Slide your feet as needed to prevent the opposing player from getting around you.,
Extend both arms completely to get as much height as possible.,
Keep your opponent pinned.,
""Chin the ball"".,
Hold the ball tightly.,
Pivot away from the basket to the sideline.,
Turn and dribble up the court if you're a guard.",How to Box Out in Basketball," Often, watching an opponent pass the ball with peripheral vision can be mistaken for a shot, particularly if it is a lob pass across the court. A common, helpful method of determining if a shot has been taken is to listen for your teammates yelling, ""shot"".If you see a shot taken, yell ""shot"" yourself so others can hear you.
If you move to box out with your back turned, the player you're guarding can easily cut past you to the basket.;
, Boxing out can vary based on what type of defense is being played. In man-to-man defense, find whatever player you were assigned to guard as they are your responsibility.This takes practice and quick thinking, but a good rule of thumb is to box out the closest opponent to the basket. If it is clear that a teammate will not be able to box out their own man, and their man is closer to the basket than your man, you should move to box out the opponent closest to the basket.

, If you're playing a high position in the zone (closer to the top of the key, past the free throw line) try to select an opponent who is also above the key.


If you're playing a low position (closer to the basket) try to find someone near to you in the paint.

, All 5 players have to box out for it to work. A rebounding mentality for a zone defense is created by understanding the offense of the opponent and what areas are critical for securing a rebound.A zone defense is predicated on guarding positions on the court so rebounding in such a defense should reflect that same mentality.
If you see the ball bounce off off the rim to your direction, don't be tempted to jump after it. You might miss it and then your man can get an offensive rebound.

, Many players will have their eyes up, watching the ball that has been shot, to try to anticipate how it will bounce off of the backboard or rim.


Their eyes will often tell you what direction they plan on moving, so you can move to anticipate them.
This can give you an advantage as they are not paying immediate attention to you.

, You shouldn't have to move much further than a couple of steps because your opponent will be moving toward you and the basket if they are going for a rebound.

, When a player of the opposing team takes a shot, you should make contact with your man using your hand or your forearm.Do not grab them or throw your arm with any kind of force, as referees will see this and call a foul.

, Turn your body to the opposite side of the arm you extended (if you extended your right arm, rotate your body to the left). Throw your arms behind you, and make a corral.As the ball is flying through the air to the basket, stay positioned with your body towards your man.


Spread your feet a foot or so further than shoulder-width, and bend your knees to lower your body. At this point, your momentum should carry you into your opponent.

, Anticipate contact with your glutes and lower back. Get low and use the strength of your base and core to keep the opponent away from the rebound.You should stop your opponent and continue to push them back, not tackle them.

, With your arms on either side, perpendicular to your body and angled backwards, you can tell where your opponent plans to move. You should plan to move in the same direction. This will prevent them from getting around you.


Do not hold them in place. Your arms are for telling where the other player is, not for keeping them stationary.With your back to the player, one leg and one arm should be on either side of your opponent's body but not touching them.
A band aid will be our example; the sticky part is your arms and legs and the padding is your main frame. You do not want the ""sticky part"" (arms and legs) to touch your opponent. Instead, the non-sticky part (your main frame, butt and back) will be the contact point that keeps him in place. You are creating a “box” that your opponent is unable to escape.

, It may feel a little awkward, but it is the most effective way to get your opponent out of your zone. Walk with him, and make sure he doesn’t get around you.If you feel that they are moving in one direction, push them the opposite way to counteract their movement. If you have a proper stance, you can move with them to either side and therefore make it extremely difficult for them to go forward in a rebounding effort.
Squat as if you’re sitting on a chair. Use your body weight to keep them from getting to the ball.

, When you are sure that you have your opponent sufficiently boxed out, it is important to then go in for the rebound yourself.Stopping your opponent’s momentum is often enough to keep them from attempting a rebound, and even if he tries to keep going, you will have an advantage of position.
The whole effort will have been pointless if you don't attempt a rebound.

, Watch where the ball goes and jump toward it when it begins to descend.

, When the shot bounces off the basket in your direction, jump to the ""high point"" (meeting the ball at the highest point of your jump) and grab the basketball for a successful rebound., Only go for the rebound if you feel that you have your opponent secured in place. If you think they can get around you, leave the rebound to another teammate and focus on keeping your opponent away from the ball., Do this by putting the ball underneath your chin and sticking your elbows out. Bring the ball right under your chin and flare your elbows out. Don't swing your elbows, you don't want to commit a foul or hurt anyone, but bring them out as wide as possible to protect the ball.This makes it harder for the defense to steal the ball from you after you secure the rebound.

, When you come down with the rebound, refrain from dribbling for a second or two as many defenders will attempt to hit it out of your hands.

, Look to throw an outlet pass to a streaking player or a guard located near the sidelines.Look for your point-guard and pass him the ball if he's open.
If you are the point-guard look up court for an open teammate close to the basket; otherwise, look to set up your offense.

, If you're a post player, wait and look for an outlet pass to a guard before running up court yourself. Don't get over confident with your ball-handling ability. Make sure all the defenders have cleared before dribbling.

Assemble a group of three.,
Avoid contact with the shooting player.The most common method of getting a foul call is through physical contact with a member of the opposing team.,
Run and rotate between the shooter and net.Although height and size are obviously important to shot blocking, agility is necessary in order to get you to a place where you can block.,
Stabilize your feet.Keeping your feet in control during all stages of a blocking technique will limit the risk of a foul, and ensure you're in proper position to continue playing smoothly once the block is completed.,
Master your jump timing.Because jump shots are some of the most-used shots in basketball, knowing how to time your jump is imperative.,
Block using the hand closest to the ball.In executing a block, you'll need to raise one of your hands up in the air to impede the ball's course.,
Practice until it's second nature.,
Choose the right shot blockers on your team.Generally speaking, the best shotblockers are the players with the largest or tallest bodies.,
Anticipate shots from the other team.,
Fake a block.Part of a successful technique relies on tricking the other player.,
Weigh the risk of a potential foul call.If you get a foul against your team, the other side will have a chance to get a clear 3 point goal.,
Stay dynamic.,
Practice a versatile range of shots.,
Jump up to fend a slam dunk.,
Accommodate to block a fadeaway shot.A fadeaway shot is where a shooting player will hop backwards as he throws the ball towards the hoop.,
Focus on your jumping.",How to Block a Shot in Basketball," In order to properly practicing blocking, you'll need three players. One person will do the passing, the second will try to receive the ball, and the third will execute the block. If you're practicing for the sake of playing competitively, it's a good idea to practice with your teammates. After all, improving their blocking skills will work out for your team just as much as honing your own. You should alternate between each of the three positions while you practice. This will make you a more dynamic player, and it will give the other players a chance to practice blocking too.


If you have a coach, he will try passing the ball.
You can do this with two players as well. If you're blocking, stand in front of a wall and try to block shots from hitting the wall. A two player practice isn't as recommended however, as it robs the dynamic element from the exercise.;
, This happens often when players are attempting to block shots. As a result, you should cater your blocking to minimize risks of bumping into a player. This can be helped by jumping upward, and using your body as an obstacle, rather than actively reaching out and grabbing the ball.


You shouldn't try to actively grab the ball out of the opposing player's hands. If you do, you'll get a foul call. A foul call will offer the other side a chance to get a 3 point shot without risk of being tampered with by your side.

, In competitive environments, opposing players are going to be moving fast. In most cases, you'll only have a few seconds to get between the other player and the net. Run to block the other player's path, and rotate quickly to face them.


It may help to do ""run and rotate"" exercises in your own time. Luckily, these can be accomplished without help from anyone else.

, Don't put one foot in front of the other. Keep them evenly spaced apart, and relatively parallel with one another.


As you ready yourself for a blocking move, it's good to arch your legs in a squatting stance. This will give you the built-up force necessary to execute a proper block.

, Hold your blocking hand up to give yourself extra height, and jump up to meet the opposing player at his highest point. One way to time properly is to watch the other player's feet as they leave the ground. This will only allot you a split-second of time to react, but with enough practice, you'll begin to find yourself jumping on instinct.


Jump directly upwards when you're blocking. This will limit the risk of coming into contact with the other player.

, The surest way of deflecting a ball is to use the hand that's closest to the ball relative to your body. While most players will harbour a preference of one blocking hand over another, it's important to get both hands versed in blocking mechanics. This will make you a more versatile, and therefore more effective player.


It's important to use your hand as an obstacle impeding the natural arc of the ball, rather than reaching out and grabbing it. Grabbing the ball directly could result in a foul call.

, Like all competitive sports, some of your success in basketball will rely on your honed instincts. This sort of thing only comes with a lot of practice. Even when you're blocking shots consistently, it's a good idea to keep pushing yourself until you're able to do so without consciously thinking about it.

, Although speed is also necessary, taller players represent a more difficult obstacle to shoot past. It may not be fair, but it does make sense from a practical standpoint.


In competitive settings, the choice of shot blockers is usually left up to the coach.

, Situational awareness is important during any basketball game. Keep your eyes peeled and be aware of what the other team's players are up to, even if they don't have the ball at the moment. If you stay focused on where the other players are, you'll be able to predict where you need to be to block shots when it counts.

, Follow up the initial steps of a blocking move. Squat your legs in front of the player and act as if you're about to jump. The other player will see you do this and rework his technique to counter the predicted block. Shooters who are worrying about blocking players tend to be less accurate. Better still, because you're technically not executing a move, there's no risk of incurring a foul.

, This doesn't make it worth it to attempt blocking all shots, especially if there's a risk for physical contact with the other player. Don't try to block a shot on the court perimeter. Even if the shot was going to miss anyway, you'll likely get a foul called on your team.

, Unlike in a practice setting, the players you're facing up against are going to be constantly changing up their tactics. This is especially true if you've been having a lot of success with blocking a certain kind of shot so far into the game. As you're playing, try to get into the other team's heads. If you're able to identify which moves each player is most likely to execute, you'll have a better chance at predicting them before they happen.

, The most successful athletes are defined by their ability to accommodate for a wide range of techniques. In a competitive environment, you can't depend on the other team to use one kind of shot. If you feel like you've mastered certain blocks but other players are still getting shots past you, it is likely you haven't taken all possible shots into account yet. Here are some common shots to look out for:


A jump shot is the most common shot. To gain height, offensive players will jump in the air and throw the ball towards the net.
A slam dunk is the most efficient shot in basketball. This is where an offensive player runs directly up the court, jumps up, and delivers it directly into the net.
A fadeaway is an advanced shot where the offensive player will lean away from the net as he throws it in. This is done to avert the efforts of blocking players. It can be resisted by putting your arms in the predicted path of the basketball.
A faked shot is where an offensive player lines up a shot but doesn't actually throw the ball. This is done for psychological reasons of tricking up the opposing team.

, Slam dunks are considered very risky shots, as it's difficult to get a proper block without incurring a foul call.If you do attempt to block a slam dunk, get in between the net and the other player and jump directly up, aiming your hand in the path of the ball.

, This tactic is specifically geared to trick up a blocking player. To maximize your chances of blocking a fadeaway, jump up between the ball and the net and extend your hands towards the ball.


Don't swing your arms unnecessarily around as you're blocking. This will incur a foul call., A significant part of blocking shots in basketball involves the proper use of jumping. Jumping is a muscle-based exercise, but it's not often seen as a primary workout focus for many players. Practice doing sets of vertical jumps, attempting to get as much force off the ground as you can. Next, add on to this exercise by holding barbells in each hand and jumping with them. This will increase the pressure on your legs, making them better-suited for jumping blocks when you play competitively."

Look for vacancies.,
Inquire about the job specifics and time commitment.,
Choose a position and apply.,
Keep looking until you find something.",How to Become a Basketball Coach2," If you’re just starting out as a coach, you’ll likely want a low-profile position that will allow you to learn on the job. Here are some places where you are most likely to find vacancies:



Local youth facilities, such as the local YMCA or YWCA, are always looking for volunteers to help with leagues of all ages. This is the ideal place to start your coaching career if you’re looking for something basic.

Recreation centers work the same way, only with openings for adult leagues. While most leagues advertise for player openings, you could try inquiring about the opportunity to test out your coaching abilities for a rec team.

House leagues or summer leagues are usually more laid-back than other leagues, and are a perfect spot for someone looking for a gig that will kickstart a coaching career. These leagues offer a wide range of ages and skill levels to choose from.

High schools occasionally have coaching vacancies, but they are usually reserved for people with experience in the field. Unless you have a strong playing background to fall back on, it may be difficult to secure a coaching job at this level.

, Before being able to commit to any gig, you should find out if it fits in your personal schedule. Unless it’s a paying job—and most assignments will not be—you’ll need to balance work and family time with your commitment to coaching. Get a handle on how often and when you’ll be expected to coach, and factor in additional time for practices if they’re required.

, Once you’ve narrowed down the list of openings, you should select the one that best fits what you hope to achieve. There will likely be paperwork (personal info, waivers, and other information) involved in finalizing a position, so make sure you fill everything in to the best of your ability.

, If nothing comes up right away, be patient. Read newspapers and check postings at recreation centers regularly. Keep yourself plugged into the coaching pipeline in case another coach learns of an opening.

"

Introduce yourself and explain what you hope to accomplish.,
Ask your players for their preferred positions.,
Run some basic drills.,
Have the players split into two teams and run some plays.,
Move players around as you see fit.,
Accentuate the positive.",How to Become a Basketball Coach3," Keep it light; you want to gain the trust of your players as quickly as possible. Be transparent about your plans, but be willing to accept suggestions or tips. Most of all, stress the importance of having fun. Your players will be looking to you for guidance, so set a good example.

, Rather than simply sending everyone out on the court and letting them start playing, you should find out who enjoys playing where. At the very least, it gives you a starting point when you run your first practice.

, Have the players do some pre-practice jogging. Encourage them to run layup lines or take jump shots. Light activity leading into a practice is a good way to prevent injury and get loose—and that goes for players of any age or skill level.

, Keep things basic at first, running simple half-court sets while focusing on instruction rather than execution. At this point, your primary goal should be to have the players moving to the right spots at the right times. Run each play until it is clear that your players understand what they’re supposed to do and where they’re supposed to be. Then, move on to the next play.

, Maybe Dave believes he should be a point guard, but that doesn’t mean he’ll be good at it. Perhaps you see Dave’s ability to move without the ball and his good mid-range shot and you decide that he would be a better small forward or shooting guard. Encourage your players to keep an open mind as you find the best fit for them. Sometimes all it takes is one or two position moves to turn your team into a world-beater.

, You may not like what you see at certain points of the practice, but a good coach will always find a way to highlight what players are doing correctly, even if there isn’t much to praise. Players—young or novice ones in particular—are more likely to respond positively when a coach isn’t berating them all the time.

Start with the most well-balanced five-player group.,
Monitor fatigued or struggling players.,
Be loud.,
Adjust your coaching style to suit the complexion of the game.",How to Become a Basketball Coach4," In practice, you likely made note of the five-player unit that worked together the best. Getting off to a fast start is important in basketball, so make sure you have the optimum lineup on the floor for the opening tip. You can tinker with it as the game progresses.

, Some days, a player just doesn’t play well. Other times, certain players tire more quickly than usual. Keep an eye on these developments and adjust accordingly. If your best shooter misses his or her first 7 attempts, try having someone else take the shots. If your center looks gassed running up and down the court, give a quick hook and get him or her a breather.

, You’re probably going to be talking to your players a lot over the course of the game, so make sure everyone can hear you, especially when the action takes place on the far end of the court. Leave no doubt as to what you want your players to do.

, If you’re winning late, run longer possessions to chew time off the clock. If you’re behind late, quicken the offensive tempo and try to score quick baskets. If you have a one-sided lead, give all of your players a chance to see the floor (something you should be doing regardless of the score if you’re coaching in a non-competitive league). Tighten the defense on players who are making a lot of shots. Get the ball to your hot shooters. Adjust appropriately to any situation, and you’ll increase your chances of success.

, This will help you out a lot in enduring the hard task at hand. You may want to start off slowly and do 25, then 50, then 75, and go from there.

, Aim to make it as perfect as possible for every shot. You can practice inside or outside, and it is a very good drill to do inside on rainy days when you are not able to go outside and shoot some hoops.

, You don't want to have to look at the ball while you're dribbling it in a game, because there are lots of other things, including players' next moves, that you need to be watching. So, it's a great idea to practice dribbling while blindfolded. Dribble in between your legs, behind you, and in front. Keep your other hand away from the ball to prevent you from accidentally double-dribbling.

, With or without a basketball, run the course over and over to build up your endurance. Obstacle courses generally include lots of running and jumping.

, Every few seconds switch your dribbling hand. Try to get faster and faster at doing this.

, Do this as fast as you can, to build up your endurance. Be cautious, especially when going downstairs.

Draw out defenders.,
Cross in front of the goal.,
Perform a through ball.,
Perform assists as a midfielder or central forward.",How to Get Assists in Soccer2," With good ball control and team coordination, you can keep control of the ball in the midfield and set up a gap in the opposing defense. Divide your team into two groups and practice passing back and forth as you look for gaps in the defense. If you can get an opposing player to run towards you, pass to a teammate as he moves to take advantage of the new opening. Try to ""spread the field"" with long passes, forcing the opposing team to defend across a long line.


You can also draw defenders by running forward without the ball, pretending you are about to make a run on goal.
Don't be a ball hog. The key to drawing out defenders — and providing an assist — is to constantly pass the ball.

, Crossing from the wing is an excellent way to get an assist. Ideally, the goalkeeper is facing you, and you pass to a striker behind him, running into the 18 yard box. This is an excellent skill to practice, especially if you are a winger or you take a lot of corner kicks.

At an amateur level, ground passes are usually best when passing in front of the goal. This will make it much easier for the forward to score. High balls are more effective only when the receiver is skilled enough to turn it into a goal.
Sometimes, a series of short and medium passes will accomplish the same thing. You may not get the assist, but you'll be a key part of the goal.

, This technique is a bit more technical, so you and the scorer will need a good deal of coordination. In this scenario, the scorer runs to stay on the same line as the defenders closest to the goal, making sure to stay on side. At the exact same moment, you kick the ball through the line of defenders as the scorer runs forward, receives the pass, and makes a run toward the goal., Attacking through the middle is the most difficult method, so you'll need excellent coordination with the striker. It will likely take several 1-2s and a great deal of skill to outplay the defenders and push through to the goal."

, Being fit is crucial to your ability to participate successfully in any team sport. Your fitness regime might include walking, running, jogging, gym workouts, lifting weights, swimming, cycling or whatever else keeps you fit in a way that you enjoy and feel good after.

, It will help you a great deal to have good arm strength. This is both a combination of exercise targeted towards strengthening arms and spending time learning which arm movements work best for you when on the court and shooting. Make mental notes of the movements that give you the best propulsion and seek to perfect this through practice.

, It needs to be somewhere you can use regularly without interruption for the practice time you've set yourself.

,, Balance is key to proper shooting. Balance yourself well before you shoot the ball.

,, Use the power in your legs to propel you upward and focus your attention on getting the ball through the net. Turn towards your opposite hand 20 to 90 degrees in order to keep your shooting shoulder, hip, and elbow in line with the basket. This also helps get more power on your shot.

They don't have to be all at once, but see how many you can do in a row at first, and then try to beat that the second set.;
, Unless you are 12 and under, weights will strongly influence your game on the court. Focus on your triceps especially, do bench presses, and leg lifts. Nothing too fancy at first, just your basic exercises.

, To be an effective rebounder, blocker, and be fast, do some calf and thigh exercises. You should do 20 calf raises with each foot every morning after you wake up. Do wall sits. Get a timer and see how long you can sit against a wall for. Then try to beat that your next set. Do 2-5 sets every Mon-Fri.

, Go to your basket and stand under the rim. Jump and hang on it 10 times in a row without taking any steps. Next, take one step and slap the backboard, then two steps, and then three steps. This will help your overall timing and jumping. Do squats, a lot of them, two or three times a week. Squats help you SO much with boxing out, balance, and of course jumping. Some people might say squats stunt your growth. Obviously if you're 7 years old and you're trying for your one max rep every other day then of course there will be some issues. But if you're 14 or 15 and you follow proper form and weight, you're fine.

,, Do machine guns, which is when you run in place and bring your knees as high as you can. See if you can do 3-5 one minute sets. Do skips, seriously. Not many people really realize that skipping helps you become quick off your feet and not helps you get to rebounds quickly.

, Be intense and all players on the court will respect you. That means go after the loose balls, run as fast as you can down the court on both offense and defense, give your defender no mercy when guarding him, but do not reach in. If you are going to foul, foul hard, and they will think twice before coming in your key. If you can dunk, dunk hard.

Practice, practice, practice.",How to Become a Better Youth Basketball Player," Sure, it looks really cool when Kobe Bryant drops a crazy fade-away jumper with two defenders on him, but you're not Kobe Bryant and chances are that you'll fail at trying to make one of those fancy shots. Just play good, simple basketball and execute the fundamentals. You'll look a lot better if you can consistently hit close-ranger two-pointers than if you sink that behind-the-back layup on your 20th try.;
, Basketball is a team sport, and if you want to win you have to work with the rest of your teammates. Don't always try to dribble past the defenders and score, pass as well especially if you think your teammate has a better chance at making the shot than you do. The guy who passes often and shoots when he's confident will get more love from his teammates than the jerk who's set on shooting the moment he touches the ball.

, Sure, it's fine to do the odd crossover (and if you're skilled at tricks then you can integrate it into your play) but messing up on a dribbling move and watching the ball roll away is one of the most embarrassing feelings you'll get on the court. Don't be too fancy.

, Basketball is by no means an easy sport, so you don't have to try to up the ante even more. If you have the shot at the open layup, take the layup; don't try to fall back and go for a fade-away jumper.

, Shooting an airball does not mean that you have a reason to cuss out yourself and everyone around you. In a real game, that would be a technical foul so keep your temper in check. If you're playing a casual pickup game with a few friends, then the occasional swear is fine but no one wants to play with a bad sport. Likewise, be a graceful winner; don't brag, don't act superior.

, If you don't bother to jump high enough to grab that rebound, then you're not gonna grab that rebound and you'll look like lazy. Always make an effort, no matter what; you'll look better and you'll play better as well.

, When you're playing basketball, just like in any other sport, you shouldn't stress out. If you're not overthinking the shot, then you'll have a better chance at scoring. Basketball is something that should come naturally; don't try to overthink or worry too much, just play. You'll perform much better for it.

, This ties in with effort; you have to practice to play better. Sometimes the most effective practice is just to play some pickup by yourself or with a friend, but it's also good to practice the fundamentals; take free throws or practice three-pointers or something like that. Also, don't worry about trying out some crazy shots, it's always fun to see those go in. However, don't waste to much time on said shots; chances are you won't get to use them very often in a real game.

",How to Become a Better Offensive Basketball Player," Players that are more concerned with their individual game hurt the overall success of their team.;
, Players should not be spectators of the game. They must always be involved and moving, even when they don't have the basketball.

, Players must always be aware of their teammates and the defensive players on the court and be ready to make a pass when appropriate. If a teammate is open and has a better scoring opportunity, then the pass must be made to them. But if you are a player that only looks to pass, your team will be unable to win due to a lack of points made. Be aware at all times of the basket and where you are in proportion to it. If no one is guarding you, take a good shot, and if a defender stabs at you, drive past them and go for a layup.

, This makes the defenders' job much harder. Players must always look for various scoring options on their set plays. If the first option that opens up leads to a good scoring opportunity, then the pass should be made. Otherwise, the players should look for other options.

, Telegraphed passes are easier for the defensive players to read and possibly steal. Players should use eye, head and ball fakes before passing the basketball.

, Everyone makes mistakes in basketball. When it happens on the offensive end of the court, players should hustle back and play good, strong defense to make up for it. They should avoid committing fouls out of frustration.

, Avoid using fakes and moves that your teammates are not ready for or familiar with. You must play within yourself on the court. New moves and fakes can be worked on during practice - not the game.

, Players must always know how much time is left on the shot clock during each possession. They must also be aware of how much time remains at the end of each quarter, the half, and the game. This is every player’s responsibility, not just the point guard's and coach's.

Follow through and hold.",How to Become a Better Basketball Shooter1," Catching the ball in a shot-ready (or athletic) position is a good way to improve your form. By being ready to shoot the ball when you catch it, rather than getting ready to shoot the ball after you catch it, you can improve the speed and accuracy of your shots.








To get into a shot ready position, bend your knees slightly and hinge your body forward at the hips. You should look as if you are getting ready to jump in the air. This will provide you with some extra power when you make your shot.;
, Your shot pocket is the position where you shoot the ball from and this is different for everyone. Try to identify the most comfortable shot pocket position for you and stick with that position.








For example, you might feel most comfortable shooting from the center of your forehead, to the right of your head, or slightly above your head.
Keep in mind that you don’t need to have the same shot pocket that other players do. Focus on what seems to work best for you.

, The position of your arm, hand, and head can also influence the accuracy of your shots. Your shooting arm and hand should form a “C” shape when you are getting ready to shoot the ball. You can check yourself in a mirror or have a friend check you from the side.








Make sure that you are looking straight ahead as well.

, When you shoot the ball, make sure that you follow through with your shot by snapping your elbow.Then, hold the position until the ball makes contact with the hoop and








Follow through with your body as well. You should begin your shot in an athletic position and then spring out of it as you make your shot. Keep your body in this extended position after you make the shot."

Standing on one foot will help to improve your balance and it will increase the difficulty of your shots as well. Start by standing near the foul line and making a shot standing on one foot.








You can stand on your left or right leg to start, but make sure that you switch legs halfway through your drill. Don’t just practice making shots on one leg.

, Standing on one foot should add enough of a challenge to start things off, so use both hands to make your shots when you first start doing elbow drills.Make sure that you keep your elbows in and point your fingers towards the center of the hoop as you make your shots.








Also, remember to find your shot pocket, create a “C” shape, and follow through after you shoot.

, Shooting in one position may help you to master shooting from that spot, but it is a good idea to practice shooting from varied positions. Try to cycle through some different shooting positions to challenge yourself in different ways.








For example, you could start out at the foul line, then move in and to the left of the hoop, then move to the right of the hoop, and then repeat the cycle.

, Move onto one-handed shots when you feel ready to increase the difficulty of your drills. Make sure that you use good form like you did with your two-handed shots. You may need to go slower until you perfect your form for one-handed shots.








If your form is really suffering as a result of switching to one-handed shots, then you can always return to two-handed shots.

, If you shoot the ball, know that you're going to make it because, if you hesitate or lose faith in your shot, you won't improve.

, If you're tall, practice playing in the paint. If you're a shooter, practice shooting the ball. If you can master one part of the game, the rest of your game will open up.

, If all you do is shoot, your opponent will play you tight and, if you only dribble, they'll guard the lane. If you change it up, though, then your opponent won't know what you'll do next, giving you the upper hand.

, If you mess around while practicing, or, if you don't give one hundred percent every time you play, then it will rub off on how you perform during the games.

Learn to trick your defender by looking at his/her eyes. If his/her eyes is not towards you then that’s the time to move quickly to a vacant spot or position where you wished to shoot the ball. Ball handlers will not hesitate to pass the ball to you when they see you wide open for a shot. Be sure that the basketball ring is visible to your eyes and you are not very close to the other opponents to get rid of distractions, deflections and blocks.;
, Sometimes ball handlers can’t notice that you are wide open for a pass to shoot. Call for his/her (ball handler) attention by yelling or some other way of calling his/her attention for him to pass the ball.

, Be focused and watch the ball closely from the time it leaves from the passers hands. Be ready to catch the ball by raising your hands high in front of your chest with fingers spread open and pointing up. Thumbs should be an inch or two apart. If the ball is not perfectly passed towards you, move towards the ball so that other defenders will not deflect it. Bend your elbows slightly as the ball hits your open hand to absorb the pass to avoid wasting it.

, Once you have the ball, hold well the ball like you don’t want to it to let go. Look straight to the rim and never be destructed from your opponents. Imagine that it’s only you and the rim that is inside the court. If possible, don’t think of passing the ball to your teammates because this will only destruct you and even destroy your plan of scoring unless the defender knew where you go and caught you that instantly.

, Breathe deeply. Bear on your mind that the ball will shoot and never think that you will miss the opportunity of scoring a basket. Never look to your opponents, just focus on the ring. Most important is you are 100% confident that you will shoot the ball!

, There are two ways on how you will shoot the ball; it is either straight to the ring or through the board. The most important thing is you know how to measure the degree and locate the focal point before shooting the ball. It is best if you practiced shooting the ball many times so that you will know different angles for shooting the ball.

, This is now the most crucial step. Your team will depend on you and wish that you will make it. Even your coach will eventually pray for you to shoot the ball if it will be the last shot for the win. You will be crowned the hero if you made it and you helped your team won the game.

As soon as you begin running with the ball, make an effort to keep your head up and your eyes pointed down the field. Scan the field ahead of you for incoming defenders so that you have time to react before they're on top of you. No matter how agile you are, you won't be able to juke if you're laid out by a tackle you didn't see coming.


Defenders won't always come from directly in front of you. To get an accurate idea of where defensive threats will come from, don't forget to give a few quick glances to your sides, as well.;
, To do a great juke, you'll need to single out the defender (or, sometimes, defenders) that are going to cause you problems. This requires making an on-the-fly judgement about which defenders downfield from you will be able to reach you before you run past them with the ball. The best way to build up this skill is simply to practice this situation — for instance, try running the ball past a few friends or teammates scattered downfield from you in mock drills.


If it seems like none of the defenders will be able to make it to you, don't bother with a juke — instead, simply run past them, as this is much less risky and is likely to win you more yards.
Don't underestimate the speed of your defenders. If you see a defender 20 yards (18.3 m) away, assuming both you and your defender are able to run the 40-yard dash in about 5 seconds (a reasonable speed both for professional and high school-level runners and defenders)and that you both run straight for each other, the defender can conceivably be on top of you in just over two seconds.

, As you draw near to a defender who is blocking your path (which, as noted above, can be in a matter of a just few seconds or less), use your body language to make it unclear which direction you'll attempt to go around him. Look at him and make a few small, quick ducking and weaving movements to your right and left using your head, shoulders, and torso to misdirect him. Don't commit too heavily to any of these movements before the actual juke, as this can slow you down, waste precious time, and ultimately make you easier to tackle.


This sort of misdirection work takes time and can slow your forward motion, so if you're surrounded or you have defenders right on your tail, you'll probably want to skip it and attempt your juke straight away. When it comes to avoiding a tackle, even a split second of extra time can make a difference, so don't waste an opportunity to gain yards by trying for a fancy juke when it's not necessary.

, As you get close to your defender, watch him — he should be attempting to read and match your movements as you duck and weave to either side. When he appears to be following your movements, pretend to commit to one direction. Take a quick step forward in that direction and shift your torso and hips in the same direction. The defender should ""take the bait"" by lunging or moving in the direction you're faking as he attempts to make contact with you.


Don't commit too heavily to your fake — the success of your juke depends on your ability to transition from your ""fake"" move to the opposite direction of motion with lightning speed.

, When your defender over-commits to blocking your motion in one direction, you want to blow around him in the opposite direction as quickly as you can so that he doesn't have the time to react and correct his mistake. Use your planted foot to push in the opposite direction and move diagonally forward and away from the direction your defender moved or lunged. As soon as you do this, start running as quickly as you can, as your defender will recognize his mistake as soon as you start to move around him and will likely be pushing as hard as he can to catch up to you.


Don't forget to keep your head up and start scanning for more incoming defenders as soon as you get around the first one. Even if you've made it past the defensive linemen and linebackers, you still have defensive safeties to worry about, so stay vigilant.

, When you start a juke by attempting to throw your defender off with quick ducks and weaves, you always run the risk that your defender won't ""take the bait"" and start following your movements and instead will head right for you. In this case, you'll need to react fast to avoid a major tackle. Pay attention to your defender as you approach him — if he shows no sign of slowing down to attempt to match your movements, pick a lateral direction (left or right) and commit to it immediately. Plant the foot on the side of your body opposite the direction you want to run and push hard to the side to propel yourself around him.


Assuming a defender is heading directly towards you at maximum speed from downfield, moving as quickly as you can to either side will usually be hard for him to react to. Because he has a great deal of forward momentum, the amount of force he needs to slow down and change direction will be more than what you'll need to accelerate around him.As soon as you seem to be out of your defender's reach, start running up the field again. Always be aware of the positions of other defenders so that you can react to them as soon as possible.

, With any sort of juking in football, time is of the essence. When you have the ball, the goal of the entire defensive team is to stop you from moving up the field, so don't expect any of the defenders to wait for you to complete a slow juke. Quick, effective jukes are always better than slower, flashier ones, so always keep your movements as short and economical as possible and be sure to run as hard as you can as soon as you get around your defender to avoid giving the defense any unnecessary opportunities to tackle you.


One mistake beginners often make when trying to learn juking skills is devoting too much time to the rapid back-and-forth fake-out motions at the start of the juke. Though these can be great for throwing off the defender who's directly in front of you, every instant you spend doing these motions is an extra instant that defenders from your sides and behind you have to get close to you, so keep them short and sweet. Also do not move the ball away from your body. If it is not tucked in, you will fumble and may not be played again for a long time. Practice ball security to perfection when doing this.

, One common addition that ball carriers make to the basic ""fake one way, go the other way"" juke is a quick spin. Spinning around a defender, rather than simply running around him, can make your intended direction of motion less obvious and can also make you trickier to grab hold of, making this move a good choice for when your defender is already too close for comfort. However, spinning can also disorient you, so it's extra important to take mental note of the defenders' positions before you do this move to avoid a surprise tackle during (or right after) your spin.


To start a spin juke, approach your defender as you would for a normal ""fake out"" juke. As you start to fake your defender out, make a quick note of where the other defenders are. When you get your defender to over-commit to one direction, quickly push off to the other side while simultaneously turning a fast 360o. Move diagonally around the defender as you spin and start sprinting upfield and scanning for defenders as soon as you're facing forward again.

, What's more stereotypically ""football"" than a beefy ball carrier effortlessly batting troublesome defenders away with a powerful stiff arm? Stiff arms (sometimes called ""stiff arm fends"") are valuable tools for ball carriers looking to keep defenders at arm's length. The basic idea of a stiff arm is to use one arm to physically push the defender away and make a tackle difficult or impossible. With a well-placed stiff arm, a short gain can become a major play or even a touchdown, so frequent ball carriers are wise to learn this move. Note that in some minor leagues (especially youth leagues and flag leagues), stiff arms may be prohibited, so ask your coach before using one in a game.


To perform a juke with a stiff arm, run upfield as you normally would until you encounter a defender. Begin a normal ""fake out"", then move around the defender (preferably so that the arm which isn't carrying the ball is on the same side as the defender). Extend your arm straight toward the defender with your palm upward and outstretched and use a pushing motion (not a striking motion) to keep the defender away or even knock him over.
Deliver stiff arms to a defender's chest pad, his shoulder pads, or the top of his helmet (not his face mask).Don't grab any part of the opponent's gear when performing a stiff arm, especially his face mask, as this can be interpreted as a foul and earn you a penalty.

, The goal of many basic jukes is to get you around the defender and running upfield as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, expert ball handlers use every opening available to them, even when it means moving backward. If a defender lunges at you from head-on and you're able to react quickly enough, try quickly stepping or hopping backwards so that he loses his balance or falls forward. Once he's off-balance or on the ground, he should present no problem — simply run around him and continue upfield.


To juke backwards, start by approaching your defender as you normally would. If he lunges directly at you and you have time to react, take a few quick steps (or jump) backward, making sure to keep out of his reach. As soon as he appears off-balance or starts falling over, take the opportunity to cut around him and run upfield.
Be cautious about moving backwards when you have the ball. While some backward motion can be useful for evading tackles, ultimately, your goal is to move the ball up the field, so start running forward or to the side as soon as you get the chance to avoid losing yards. Also remember that defenders can come from behind you (especially if you've already gained substantial yards).

, It's important to remember that you're not alone when you're running the ball up the field. In fact, once you start running up the field, it's the entire offense's job to keep you from getting tackled. If you have one or more blockers near you while you're running with the ball, use them to your advantage. Try to juke around defenders so that you position a blocker between yourself and the defender. Your blocker may be able to slow the defender down or even take him out of the play entirely, making your job of advancing the ball that much easier.


For instance, let's say you have the ball and you're running down the field with an offensive lineman to your left when you see a defender approaching you from directly ahead. If you attempt a juke in this situation, it would be smart to fake right, then go left behind your lineman. This way, you position the lineman between yourself and the defender. Hopefully, he will be able to react to the situation quickly and deliver a crucial block, but even if he doesn't, he may slow the defender down by forcing him to go around (or through) him.

, Being explosive will be crucial. If you want to be able to juke you want to have fast feet. Which mean you should train with a agility ladder and, use a jump rope, and do jumping. Being explosive is very important because it is the ability of how fast you can reach a max speed or strength. ]

Running backs, who are often responsible for running the ball up the field and thus get many opportunities to juke, often have a workout routine that includes plenty of core and lower body exercises, like squats, deadlifts, crunches, and hip exercises.In addition, shoulder and chest exercises can improve your ability to perform stiff arms and shake tackles.
As with all forms of strength training,proper form and technique during football conditioning is vital for preventing injury in the workout room and on the gridiron. Be sure you understand all strength training exercise before you attempt them and start with low weights until you master proper technique. If you have one available to you, consult a trainer for advice if you're unsure of what to do.

, Speed and agility are important not just for performing quick jukes but also for completing successful plays and moving the ball up the field after your juke. The faster you are, the further up the field you'll be able to get before you even need to juke and the quicker you'll be to capitalize on a defender's mistake when you're trying to get around him. Increase your speed on the field with a smart, speed-focused exercise regimen to become the best juker you can be.


To improve their speed and agility, running backs often incorporate sprints into their exercise routines. As a simple sprinting exercise, try the ""sprint ladder"". Start out by sprinting 10 yards (9.1 m) down the field, turning, and sprinting 10 yards (9.1 m) back as fast as you can. Rest for 30 seconds, then sprint 20 yards (18.3 m), turn, and sprint back. Rest for 30 seconds again, then repeat for 30, 40, and 50 yards (45.7 m), resting for 30 seconds between each sprint.
One great way to measure your improvement when doing speed training is to time yourself. Using a stopwatch to keep track of the time it takes you to complete your sprints lets you track your progress and can encourage you to push extra hard to shave seconds off of your record times.

, In the chaos of an important running play, the ball handler's reaction speed can be the difference between a loss of yards, a minor gain, and a touchdown run. Juking against a skilled defender requires you to read minor signs in your opponent's body language, judge his intentions, and get around him before he has a chance to react, sometimes all in less than a second. The sharper your reflexes are, the quicker you'll be able to react to your defender, which can give you a huge advantage.


One great way to improve your juking reflexes is simply to practice juking against a reasonably experienced defender. For instance, you might try simply squaring off against a friend in an empty field and trying to run the ball past him without letting him touch you. Doing this lets you practice reading your opponent and getting familiar with various juking methods in addition to putting your fast-twitch reflexes to the test.
For extra practice, try facing off against two or more friends lined up at different points down the field.

, A ball carrier should never try to go around or through a defender when he has an equally open path that's unguarded. Most offensive running plays are designed to open up gaps (or ""holes) in the defense's formation to give runners easy pathways to run for yards. Whenever possible, try to exploit these holes in the arrangement of the defensive players. The best runners are always looking for defensive holes to run through, especially after jukes, when the arrangement of defensive players may have shifted.


To notice holes in the defense, you'll need to be sure to keep your head up and your eyes on the field ahead of you whenever you're running with the ball. Good situational awareness is important for any football player, especially one tasked with advancing the ball.
It can also be helpful to go over game footage with the guidance of an experienced player or coach. Having a bird's eye view of the action during a game allows you see how defensive holes form and how offensive players can exploit them with proper strategy.

, Football has no shortage of role models when it comes to great jukers. Studying the fancy footwork of your favorite running back or quarterback is a great way to see world-class strength and agility in action. Additionally, watching professional football players can expose you to new juking strategies that wouldn't have been introduced to introduced to otherwise and give you high-water marks for excellence to shoot for. Below are just a few of the all-time greats when it comes to agility on the gridiron:


Walter Payton: Nicknamed ""Sweetness"" for the way he seemed to effortlessly dance up and down the field, Payton is considered by some to be the greatest running back of all-time.Payton's speed and agility are legendary, helping him claim the NFL record for all-purpose rushing yards at 21,803.
Marcus Allen: Considered one of the best short-yardage NFL runners ever, Allen achieved infamy with a record-breaking 74-yard run in Super Bowl XVIII that started with a fantastic juke.Jim Brown: Brown, who played in the late 50s and early 60s, is now widely regarded as one of the greatest football players in the history of the sport. With an amazing talent for raw physicality, Brown was a serious force to be reckoned with on the field. When he decided to juke rather than simply demolish his defenders, Brown usually left his opponents in the dirt.
Bo Jackson: Jackson was known in the 80s and 90s for being one of the fastest players in the NFL. He used his speed to go around people if he could, but could also, if needed, juke. If you are already faster than most opponents, try to use speed more than agility, but learn the basics of agility so that you are always ready for any situation.
Some of football's greatest jukers are from the modern era. Players like Reggie Bush, Adrian Peterson, Marshawn Lynch, and many others have made names for themselves as extremely skilled runners at the college or professional level (or both).

Learn the basic rules of a field goal kick.,
Set up the football.,
Walk backward away from the ball the number of paces appropriate for you.,
Position yourself in an athletic stance.,
Take your approach steps.,
Position your plant foot so that it points toward your target.,
Keep your hips and shoulders in line.",How to Kick a Field Goal1," In the National Football League (NFL), any field goal attempted and missed from beyond the 20-yard line causes the defensive team to take possession of the ball where the kick was missed. Any field goal attempted and missed from on or inside the 20-yard line causes the defensive team to gain possession of the ball on the 20-yard line.









The football must pass between the goal posts in order for a field goal to count. It is allowed to hit the side of the goal posts first as long as the football goes through afterward.
A field goal is worth three points and is usually run on a fourth down when a team is within reasonable distance of their opponent's end zone.;
, Place the football perpendicular to the ground on the holder. The football should be mostly upright with a slight slant toward the holder.









Line up the laces so that they are facing the field goal. Doing so prevents the laces from interfering with the direction of the ball.
This also allows you to kick the ball on the back seams, the spot which creates maximum compression when kicked. Maximum compression ensures that the football will travel farther and higher.

, While there is no concrete number of paces that you must step back, for most is it about three large paces back and two paces to the left of the ball for right-footed kickers.









For left-footed kickers, take three paces back and two to the right of the ball.
Try out different distances to see what works best for you. The length of your legs will have an impact on how far you step back. The longer your legs, the longer your stride will be when you run to kick the ball.
The important thing to remember when stepping back is to be consistent. Find a distance that works for you and practice it consistently.

, An athletic stance means that your knees are slightly bent, you are resting on the balls of your feet, and your body weight is centered over your hips.









Place the foot that you will not use to kick the ball slightly in front of your kicking foot. This foot is called your plant foot because you will plant it next to the ball while kicking.
Place your kicking foot slightly behind your plant foot. The toes of both feet should be pointing toward the places they will be upon contact.

, Calculating the correct number of approach steps is one of the trickiest parts of kicking a field goal. Usually, kickers take about two to three approach steps. Approach steps are executed at a relatively slow pace and in three steps:









The first step is optional and is called a jab step. This step will be a short step in the direction of the ball with your plant foot. Its purpose is to shift your body weight forward in the direction of the ball.
The second step is called the drive step and is executed by taking a long stride in the direction of the ball with your kicking foot.
The third step is taken by your plant foot to the side of the football. This is the most important step as it determines where your plant foot will anchor you to the field while you kick the ball.
Because you are lined up behind and to the side of the football, you will be approaching the ball in a diagonal line.

, Your target is the area of the field goal that you want the ball to go through. Your plant foot should be about five to seven inches behind your target.









The depth of your plant foot will vary depending on the height of the ball. If you are kicking on the ground your plant foot will be about four inches deeper than the football.
If you are using a one-inch tee, your plant foot will be about two inches deeper than the football, and if your tee is about two inches high, your plant foot will be about equal with the football.

, When you approach the football, be sure to have your torso square. This will help you achieve a steady balance while kicking.

Exercise your core.Core-building exercises are necessary to keep your overall fitness and center of balance aligned with the strength you're building in your legs.,
Workout in the pool.",How to Kick a Football," This is the easiest way to begin kicking a football. Cheap plastic tees are available at most sporting goods stores, as well as more expensive pro-style tees. Whichever tee you elect to use, place the ball so the laces are away from you and toward your intended target. The ball should be upright so the points are aimed straight up and straight down and tilted slightly backward.









Anytime you're kicking, make sure your ball is pumped up to the proper specifications. Kicking a flat ball is counterproductive and can be somewhat painful on your foot.;
, In a football game, the tee and resulting kick is used at the beginning of the game and after points are scored for the kickoff. The goal is distance, aiming to kick the ball about a yard deep into the end zone (about 65 yards in college and pro ball, 60 yards in high school). You can back up as far as you want to for a running start at the ball.









Set yourself several yards behind the tee, to the opposite side of your kicking foot. If you're right-footed, take a few steps to your left.
Some kickers favor a nine step approach for kickoffs. Start with your non kicking foot, taking a short ""jab step"" to get you started. Practice running up to the ball several times, aiming to plant your non-kicking foot directly beside the football. The location of your plant foot should be about a foot away from the ball, the center of your foot aligned with the football.
Practice this without a football but with a tee several times to get your timing right.

, After arriving at the ball with a correct plant and stepping motion, a free flowing controlled leg swing is necessary. Many young kickers believe that they need to throw their entire body into their swing to get distance, but like golf, a kicking swing is all about form and control.









Your kicking leg should be cocked at its apex just as your plant foot makes contact with the ground. You shouldn't have to reach back any farther than your normal running stride. It should be comfortable and not over-extended, but ready to snap down into kicking form just as you've planted.
Your toe should be pointed down, and you should make contact with the center of the ball using the inside-top of your foot along the inside laces of your shoe. Your leg should be straight. Don't worry too much about accuracy for now, just let one rip to get a feel for the speed and strength required.
Old-school kickers sometimes favor a smaller number of steps and a toe-kick, which results in less accuracy but lots of power. You can experiment with this style once you've got the fundamentals down.

, Bring the arm opposite your kicking foot across your body to counterbalance the leg swing and allow their leg a clean swing lane to come up through the ball. Keep your head down on the ball and allow the momentum of your leg swing to carry your body through the kick.









Imagine your toe is a remote control you have to use to point the ball toward the target. After you make contact, aim where you want it to go.

, Kicking a field goal requires a more coordinated timing than kicking off, because the defense will be trying to block the kick or otherwise disrupt the play. Shortening your approach to two or three steps allows you to approach the ball much more quickly, ensuring a successful kick.









The three-step approach is the most common. It's quick enough to beat the defense, but also allows another beat for a missed snap and for the holder to get the ball oriented correctly. From the location the ball will be kicked (start practicing with a tee before graduating to a holder), take three steps straight backward and two steps straight to the left (if you're right footed) or to the right (if you're left footed).

, Standing with your non-kicking foot forward, imagine a straight line between you and the ball as you approach, keeping your feet oriented straight. Like with a kickoff, your first step will be a jab step, but with your kicking foot this time. Practicing running in a straight line at the ball, your third step planting directly beside the ball with your kicking leg ready and cocked.









In a two-stepping pattern your first step is a balance step, setting up your arms and body for the drive into the ball. After this step, you should be halfway to the ball and in a direct line to your plant spot. The second step is the plant step, which sets up the kick and plants the foot.

, Field goal kicking is a game of precision and your accuracy is all in the approach. Make sure to avoid an off-kilter sidestep as you approach, keeping your steps in the straightest possible line to the ball. Planting your non-kicking foot too far back will result in your pulling the ball too far across your body, and planting your non-kicking foot too far forward will result in a kick too low and weak for make it through the uprights.








, After you're knocking in the three-pointers from all over the field, start practicing your timing with a partner as a holder. Your holder will need to catch the ball, place it, and reorient the laces toward the goal all while you're running toward him at full speed, so getting your timing down is critical.









The ball should be planted enough before you plant your foot that you can see it and correct accordingly.

, Kickers are in a very vulnerable position in football. They rarely get any recognition until the game is on the line and the team needs the ball to sail through the uprights for a victory. Recently, some coaches have even started ""icing"" the kicker before an important field goal by taking a time out just before the kick, to amp up the stress of the situation. But by focusing on the little things--your approach, keeping a straight line, planting your foot, and following through, you should be able to put this stress aside and make accurate kicks.

, Sometimes, among a football team, the kickers will be seen as somehow separate from the rest of the team. By participating in the team's conditioning and lifting activities, you will not only become a better athlete, but also an integral part of the team. #*Never allow yourself to become secluded as you will need your teammates' support to be successful in games. Make friends on the team and actively congratulate their successes.


Build a good relationship with your holder and snapper so you can step onto the field knowing you're well rehearsed and in sync, ready for a successful kick.

, No one makes every kick. But dwelling on a missed extra point will only hurt you later in the game when you've got the chance to seal it with a field goal. Kickers need to get each kick out of their system quickly and focus on the mechanics of kicking.


When you make one, celebrate and enjoy the field goal like a running back would enjoy a touchdown, but don't dwell on the good any more than you would the bad.
To keep focused on other things, watch the game. You should be whooping and hollering along with the rest of the guys on the team to get your mind off of your own tasks until it is absolutely necessary.

, Your legs need to be loose and flexible, especially before you start belting 40 yard (36.6 m) field goals. The first and last ten minutes of your kicking workouts should consist of stretching, with most of the focus on your legs. Kicking trainers recommend 2-3 more stretch sessions throughout the day, first thing in the morning an at the end of the day before bed., Get down on one knee with your other foot in front of you at a comfortable distance, as if you were doing a lunge and went all the way down to your knee. If your left knee is down, raise your left arm straight up in the air and your right arm straight out to your side, at a perpendicular angle. Stretch your right arm back toward your left foot. Hold it for a count of 15 and then switch to the other side and repeat.

, On your back, with your legs up in the air, cross your right leg over your left at the knee. With your hands behind your left leg, pull both toward your chest. You should feel the stretch in the buttocks of the crossed leg. Hold for a 15 count and then switch legs.

, Sitting on the ground, touch the bottoms of your feet together in the ""butterfly"" position. Take your feet in your hands and stretch by leaning forward slightly and trying to touch the outside of your knees to the ground.


As with any stretch, do this slowly and hold it for at least 15 or 20 seconds. Don't bounce your legs.

, These muscles in your thigh are good to stretch thoroughly before running or kicking. In a standing position, pull your foot back with your hand until it's touching or almost touching your buttocks. You should feel the stretch in the front of your thigh. Alternate legs and hold for 15 or 20 seconds each.


You can also do this laying on your side so you don't have to keep your balance on one foot.

, In a seated position with both legs straight, cross one leg over the other, touching the crossing foot to the ground. Next, twist so that the opposite elbow is on the outside of the crossing knee. If you're crossing your right leg over your left leg, take your left elbow and twist your back so it's touching the outside of your right knee. Keep your back straight and you should feel the stretch loosening your lower back. Hold the stretch without bouncing and then switch to the other side.

, Developing the fast twitch muscles in your legs is the most important part of kicking. While linebackers may have the ""strongest"" legs on the football field, the kickers need to have the quickest.


Incorporating shuttle runs or ""suicides"" into your work out routine is a good way to develop these muscles and ensure that your legs will be among the quickest on the field. On a track, try sprinting the straightaways and walking the curves. Go all the way around the track twice.

, These don't require weights but rely on the body to create its own resistance.


The isometric wall squat is a common exercise for kickers. Place your back against the wall and squat until your thighs are parallel with the ground and your shins parallel with the wall, making a 90 degree angle. Hold for 20-30 seconds and repeat 2-3 times.
Isometric calf raises can be useful in building fast-twitch response in your legs. On a stair or other raised surface, stand with your toes holding your up and your heels hanging off in the air. Flex your calves to raise yourself up and down slowly, holding it for a count of 5 at the bottom and time of the exercise. Be careful if you do this on the stairs to stay balanced. You might use a rail or a chair to hold for balance.

, Kicking is a full-body motion with much of the strength coming from your back and abdominals.


Alternate abdominal crunches with leg raises in your exercise routine. Start out with 3 sets of 20 crunches. In between each set, lay on your back with your hands under your buttocks and raise your legs in the air together, bringing them back down parallel with the ground, but not quite touching it. Hold that position for a count of five and raise them back up. Do sets of 10 leg lifts and alternate with the crunches to build your core.

, The pool is a great piece of equipment for a kicker and can be used both for a simple workout and practicing your kicking motion when you've developed a kicking routine.


Incorporate high knees, butt-kicks, jumps, and lunges into the workout. Perform 50-70 kicks, doing your full kicking form including the follow through in the pool.

Square piece of fabric
Rubber bouncing ball about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter
Rubber band;
, Many materials around the house are perfect for making a penalty flag in a pinch. Think about using dish rags, larger fabric samples, and swaths. A cloth napkin is a sure-fire winner, and though any size will work, for the most authentic flag, use either the luncheon or dinner sizes at 13 inches (33.0 cm) by 13 inches (33.0 cm) and 18 inches (45.7 cm) by 18 inches (45.7 cm) respectively.

, This ensures that you will have the same amount of cloth on all sides of your flag. Not only will your flag look better, it will also be more aerodynamic. Remember an even placement of weight will allow your flag to be thrown farther and much more accurately.

, Bring them together and twist the fabric tightly around the bouncing ball. When the ball seems tightly wrapped and secure, pinch the twisted area of fabric shut.

, In order to form a sturdier bundle, you may need to wrap the rubber band around the twisted area of fabric several times. This will secure the ball inside of the fabric and keep the flag in one piece.

Make contact with the ball.,
Kick the ball with the top of your foot.,
Follow the kick through your target.,
Keep the speed and strength of the kick consistent all the way through.,
After you follow through, hop your plant foot slightly forward.",How to Kick a Field Goal2," Aim for the ""sweet spot,"" about 4 inches (10.2 cm) above the bottom tip of the football. Where you make contact with the ball is important because it allows you to manipulate the distance and height that the football will travel.








, By using the bone on the top of your foot, you are able to produce the maximum transfer of energy to the ball.









There are two types of kicking, straight and soccer-style. Almost all professional football players use the soccer-style kick.
A straight kick simply means that after you make contact with the ball, your leg follows through in a straight line perpendicular to the ground. Straight-on kickers lock their ankles while kicking, allowing them to efficiently transfer kinetic energy forward.
A soccer kick occurs when you swing your leg through to the opposite side of the ball that you kicked after making contact. Soccer-style kickers angle their foot at an obtuse angle, causing some of energy to be absorbed by the ankle joint. Test out both to see which you prefer, but remember that modern convention points to the soccer kick as the better of the two styles., Once you make contact with the football, don't stop the forward motion of your foot. Instead, try to continue the kicking motion until well after the ball has left your foot.








, You do not need to change the power you put into your kick much even if you are kicking a long field goal. The power in your kick comes from your plant leg and the momentum of your kicking leg.








, This will occur naturally as a result of the forward momentum of your body and your body's effort to keep you on balance.

Collect the necessary items.,
Cut the fabric into squares of the appropriate size.,
Make a weighted balloon for the flag by filling a balloon with sand.,
Place the weighted balloon in the middle of the fabric.,
Pull up all four corners of the fabric.,
Wrap a rubber band around the fabric.",How to Make Referee Penalty Flags2," This design is only slightly more involved; however, the end result will look more authentic. You will need these six items to make this flag:


(1) yellow fabric (preferably nylon or cotton)
(1) empty 16 fl. oz. plastic bottle
(1) funnel
(2) 11 inches (27.9 cm) latex balloons
(1) rubber band
2 oz. fine grain sand

, Professional grade flags often are made out of nylon which is light-weight, durable, and weather-resistant. Regulation-sized flags are 15 inch (38.1 cm) by 15 inches (38.1 cm).

, Originally, penalty flags were filled with a wide range of objects like fishing sinkers, lead weights, ball bearings, washers, golf balls, and even BB pellets.However, sand is universally used today.


Place one balloon inside of the other for extra durability. Begin by stretching the first balloon over the narrow end of the funnel. Stretch the second balloon over the first. Remove the double-layered balloon from the funnel and reserve.
Fill the bottle with sand by using the funnel. Place the funnel into the open bottle and pour the sand into it. Tap the funnel a few times to make sure all of the sand has gone into the bottle.
Inflate the balloon with enough air to make room for the sand. Twist the balloon’s spout shut to keep air from escaping.
Stretch the balloon’s spout over the bottle and invert so that the sand falls into the balloon. Untwist the kink in the balloon and allow the sand to fill it. Remove the balloon from the bottle.
Let any excess air out of the balloon and tie it shut at the spout. Now, you have a set weight for your flag that is neatly contained.

, Once again, this ensures the same amount of cloth on all sides of your flag, which makes it more aerodynamic. Using sand as a weight will allow your flag to be thrown a considerable distance and with even more accuracy.

, Bring them together and twist the fabric tightly around the weighted balloon. When the balloon seems tightly wrapped and secure, hold the twisted area of fabric shut.

, In order to form a sturdier bundle, you may need to wrap the rubber band around the twisted area of fabric several times.

Decide what kind of penalty flag you need.,
Wear the flag with the excess material in your pocket and the weighted end hanging outside of it.,
Test out the flags before the game.",How to Make Referee Penalty Flags3," Penalty flags can be different colors depending on their use or associated sport.


Penalty flags were introduced to American college football in 1941. They were originally white.
By 1948, white penalty flags were officially adopted for use in professional games.
In 1965, yellow flags became the standard color for NFL, NCAA, high school, and flag football.
Red penalty flags were used intermittently in American college games until the mid-1970s.
Today, orange penalty flags are used in Canadian football, and yellow penalty flags are used in American football.
Coaches will sometimes use a red flag to contest a referee’s yellow penalty flag., Alternately, you can pull the excess material through the side of your belt leaving the weighted end at the tip of your fingers. With the flag held like this, it is easy to grab.

, Beforehand, toss the flags around to ensure of their aerodynamics and stability. Make sure to become comfortable with it in your grip.

,, Take 3-5 steps away from the ball then take about 1 1/2 steps to the left of ball (take opposite way if you're a lefty). After that give your Coach or Referee a hand up signal that shows you're about to kick the ball.

,, If your coach wants you to kick low hit the ball less under the ball (kick ball almost in the middle).


Don't kick the ball as hard as you can because you can lose control or accuracy of the ball depending where ever you want the ball to go.

, Your leg needs strength and a handy flexibility to it. Your kick needs to be almost up to your helmet (don't try too high or you will pull a muscle). Really practice and whenever you're going to kick don't think of crowd always think of the steps or how the ball is going to launch!

, Sink your body down using your leg and core muscles so that your knees are bent and waist is lowered, and you are ready to explode. As you sink your body weight down, be sure to keep the tension in your upper back. You want to be in a 45 degree lean at this point.Keeping your eyes on your opponents armpit is another good way to keep your back in the right position to prevent injury.

, Putting your hands in front of you will ensure that you’re ready to move. It helps you focus on what’s in front of you and helps keep your weight forward.

, Having this body posture will only help you hit harder if you’re in the correct positioning when you near your opponent. You want to be right on him, as though you’re stepping on his feet, when you are preparing to tackle him. Take his next step away from him., Use your arms for power by swinging them opposite of your legs. Each time you step with your left leg, your right arm should come through powerfully. Then, your right arm should swing back as your left arm moves forward with your right leg. The motor of your shoulder will help pick your legs up and down. Be aggressive with your arms., If you activate your arms, it will help you drive your knees up. When running, your knee should come up to propel you forward, and then your foot should land directly beneath your body. This will help engage your hips and make you run faster toward your opponent. Your hips will roll through like an elastic band if you enact your shoulders and legs in your run.

, The most common problem among players is that they let up before impact. This slow down makes for less hitting power. You want to cut your last step in half, but keep it as powerful and fast as the previous steps. This half step will allow you to align your body weight over your hips and help you hit harder., Drive your entire body into your opponent. You do this by driving your hips forward through your shoulders for ultimate power. Driving your shoulder through them. This gives you the force to drive your opponent backwards, regardless of their size.


Remember to hit low. This will help knock them out of balance. They will wave you off easily if you go in high. Your shoulder should hit in the number area of your opponent’s jersey., Shoot your hands up and grab onto your opponent. Make sure not to grab them by only their jersey or you’ll be called for a penalty. Do not stop your feet to wrap your arms around them: it should be one fluid movement. Lock your arms around his body; if you cannot lock your arms, grab as much of his padding as you can., This is ultimately helps override any of the force that your opponent has. The rotation is what will give you the advantage, even if you’re a smaller person. Use your right or left foot to push off as hard and as fast as you can to create this rotation. If you use your right foot, you’ll drive your opponent in a counter-clockwise motion: if you use your left food, your opponent will rotate in a clockwise motion. This will create “rise” through the ball carrier.A stronger lower body will help you take down your opponent with more force. Doing heavy lifts such as squats, deadlifts, thrusters, and hang cleans will increase your lower body strength.

Treat the football gently when using.,
Clean the football after each use.,
Store the football in a cool, dry place.Moisture on the football and excessive exposure to heat will lead to cracking and shrinkage on the surface of the ball.",How to Inflate a Football," A football will tell you how much pressure to use when inflating it in one of two units of measurement: BAR or P.S.I. This number is often printed around the valve or will be included in the football’s instruction manual. If your football is worn and the number is not visible, you can use the size of the football to estimate the BAR or P.S.I.:


Size 5: 0.8 - 1.0 BAR (11.6 - 14.5 P.S.I)
Size 4: 0.7 - 0.8 BAR (10.1 - 11.6 P.S.I.)
Size 3: 0.5 - 0.7 BAR (7.2 - 10.1 P.S.I.)
1 BAR = 14.5 P.S.I.;
, This is necessary to do if the ball is completely flat or very deflated. Roll the ball around with your hands so it is less wrinkled and less folded.

, The bladder is an inner tube that you do not want to puncture when inserting the long needle into the valve (the black circle with a hole in the center). If you hold the football up, shake it around, and tap it, you will be able to move the bladder away from the valve.

, By doing so, the bladder will hang directly underneath the valve, reducing the risk of damage.

, Place 1-2 drops of lubricant directly on the needle, and spread it with your finger so the entire needle is lubricated.You can use specially designed valve products, normally either silicone or glycerin sprays. If you do not have valve lubricant, dip the needle in water.

, There will be an attachment on your air pump’s hose where the needle attaches. Insert the needle into this area of the pump. Where the needle attaches may vary according to the make and model of your pump.

, It should slide in with little resistance, but you may have to exert some force to get it in. Once the needle is entirely in the valve, you can turn the air pump on to begin inflating the football.

, Use the air pump until the gauge on the pump shows the necessary BAR or P.S.I. For example, if your football should be at 0.5 - 0.7 BAR (7.2 - 10.1 P.S.I.), keep the pump on until the gauge is between those numbers.


The gauge will have a needle that shows what BAR or P.S.I. it is currently at.
Do not over-inflate the ball by going over the recommended BAR or P.S.I.

, Once the desired pressure has been reached, you can turn off the air pump and remove the needle. Pulling the needle out quickly will prevent any air from escaping.

, Each time you use your football, check the BAR or P.S.I. Keeping the football at its optimal pressure is essential to keep your football in peak condition.

, Throwing the football at a wall or asphalt will damage it, and a broken football is difficult to restore. Kick, throw, and catch the football, but never throw it at hard surfaces such as concrete or asphalt.

, Use a wet cloth or towel to remove mud or dirt from the football. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as this can damage the stitching and outer layer of the ball.

, Between uses, store the football somewhere cool and dry.

It doesn't matter which end of the ball you put in your hand, or where the laces are when you're holding the ball, but it does need to be positioned securely.


If you want to learn to hold the ball for throwing, the technique will be slightly different. Learn how to throw a football properly by clicking here.;
, To seat the ball properly and tuck it, put your index finger on the very tip of the ball and bring it to rest even against the inside of your forearm. The ball should be seated so you can wrap your fingers around the part of the ball that starts to taper to the point, wresting it against your wrist.Alternatively, some players like to rest the point between two fingers, either the index and middle or the middle and ring. For some, this is a comfortable way of securing the ball, while it feels awkward for others. Experiment and see if it feels right for you.

, Your arm should mimic the natural curve of the ball, bending your wrist to seat the ball in the ""pocket"" of your forearm, wrist, and shoulder firmly. To support the underside of the ball, curve your wrist, grip it firmly with your fingers, and hold it against your arm.


It’s important that you use your whole arm to support the weight of the ball, not primarily using your hand or the strength in your fingers. That's a good way to get the ball stripped and fumble.

, Hold the ball against your chest on one side of your body, above your ab muscles but below your pecs, keeping your elbow as close to the side of your body. This ensures great ball control with little chance of losing grip because of a defender.

, With your other hand, cover the ball as if you were protecting a delicate object and trying to keep it safe. When you're running in traffic, it's important to use every angle of your body to shield the ball and keep it from prying hands. Cover up the ball as much as possible with your other hand.


When you’re running for speed, you can use your other arm to pump and move forward, carrying you with momentum and helping you balance, but when you move in traffic you’ve got to wrap it up.

, A lot of coaches say this may be the single most important drill they do for ball carrying. Quarterbacks, running backs, cornerbacks, safeties, tight ends and receivers–all plays who touch the ball should all practice holding the ball and drill regularly in ball-handling skills. If there's any possibility that you'll ever end up with the ball in your hands, you need to learn to hold it properly.


Ball-handling drills don't need to be complicated and you can do them in conjunction with other conditioning exercises. Try running tires while you're holding the ball, or running stairs while you're holding the ball. Do any drill that doesn't require hands with a ball in your hands.

, However well you've trained and coached, one thing happens to a lot of beginning players: as soon as you start running, the technique goes out the window. Your elbows pop out, the ball flails around your body, and often comes loose. While this partially comes with experience, there's one little trick to help keep you from fumbling. Keep your elbows in tight to your body and the ball will be more secure.


When you run with the football, pretend there's a magnet that's pulling your elbow toward your hip. This will help to pocket the ball more securely and keep you from flailing as you might be inclined to do. It'll be automatic eventually.

, Good football players can carry the ball just as securely in both arms, so it's important to spend as much if not more time drilling with the ball in your non-dominant hand to build the skills necessary for good ball-handling.


This is especially important for running backs, who generally want to pocket the ball in the arm closest to the sideline, or in the direction of travel. In other words, if you're cutting to the left, you usually want to carry the ball in your left hand to keep it away from defenders.

, Football's a crazy game and you've got to learn to adapt to the play as it changes and adapt to the defense as they shift. Generally, you want to switch the ball to the side of your body farthest away from defenders and closest to the sideline, to protect it as much as possible. Put your body between the defender and the ball.


Practice shifting the ball but keeping it tight and secure as possible. The ball should be touching your torso at all times as you shift your arm, then cover the ball with both arms like you're hugging it, then take control of the ball with your other arm and move it over. Don't juggle it between your hands.
If you’re running toward the sideline, you want the ball to be as close to the sideline as possible so that, should you fumble, the ball is more likely to go out of bounds so your team will retain possession.

, To practice getting stronger and securing the ball in contention with defenders, it's common to practice ball wrestling drills as a way of getting players to hold the ball more firmly. Whether you do this as part of football practice or not, it can be a great way of improving your skills with a friend or two.


Pair up, one ball-handler and one defender. The runner will hold the ball securely while the other player will get a hand on it, running in tandem and trying to rip the ball away for a distance of five yards. At the five yard cone, the defender should make one last big rip at the ball, at which time the ball carrier should secure it and accelerate five more yards to finish the drill.
It's important to finish strong, focusing on keeping the ball running moving forward and powering past the defender. The drill doesn't end when the player holds the ball, it ends with a power-up spring through to the finish., Another popular ball-handling drill that will help you avoid turnovers is a lot like the ball-wrestling drill, and can be practiced with two players. The runner will secure the ball firmly and run five yards while a defender positions just behind the runner, with his hands on the runner's hips. The defender will shuffle and try to hold the runner back during the drill, then swipe at the ball just before the five yard marker. After securing the ball, the runner should power through for another five yards.

Start preparing early.,
Take the right classes.,
Maintain good grades.,
Get solid ACT or SAT scores.,
Register with the NCAA.,
Adhere to NCAA regulations.,
Understand the terms of your scholarship.",How to Get a Football Scholarship1," Recruiting is a process that takes years and college coaches will often take a look at even freshman athletes. During your first year of high school, talk with your guidance counselor about taking courses that will satisfy the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) core course requirements. Begin to watch your GPA. And, play the best that you can every game while bonding with your coach., To gain NCAA eligibility, you’ll need to complete a set of core courses. For Division I athletes this includes four years of English, three years of Mathematics, two years of Natural Sciences, and other classes as well. Check the NCAA website for your specific requirements and discuss these with your high school guidance counselor.The NCAA website also contains a handy pdf worksheet that allows you to track your academic progress on your own. You can also find out more information about how transfer credits figure in to eligibility.

, Colleges are looking for athletes, but also students who can succeed academically and graduate. The GPA requirements for NCAA eligibility are mapped alongside your test scores. So, for example, if your GPA isn’t as good you will need strong ACT or SAT test scores. In contrast, a high GPA can balance out a low test score.As an example, a high school athlete looking to land a Division I football scholarship will need a minimum 2.3 GPA to meet minimum eligibility requirements.
Keeping a strong GPA can also help you to land a combined athletic/academic scholarship package. A little known truth is that many athletes, especially at smaller schools, survive off of mixed scholarships., As mentioned before, your test scores will be placed on a sliding scale alongside your GPA. Try to study for these tests before you take them. You can also take them as many times as you wish in order to get a higher score. But, be aware that you will pay a fee to test each time and to transfer your scores to the NCAA.For example, a football player with a 3.55 GPA, who is looking to land at a Division I school, will need a minimum 400 SAT or 37 ACT score for eligibility ., At some point in your sophomore year, go to the online NCAA Eligibility Center (located on the main NCAA website) and complete your college eligibility application. Gather all of your information beforehand as you will need to provide extensive data regarding your personal life, educational life, and sport participation history. You will also need to pay an application fee.After you’ve completed your application you can check your status online. Over 90 percent of applicants are determined to be eligible, so your odds are generally good if you’ve followed the basic NCAA rules.
Some of the choices that can render an athlete ineligible are the following: playing football in a professional league; accepting prize money; getting agent representation; signing a professional contact., Be aware that the NCAA can also suspend an eligible athlete with due cause. Consult the NCAA’s Guide for the College-Bound Student-Athlete, available in both printed and online versions, for information on recruiting restrictions. You’ll also want to watch out for ‘moral violations,’ such as drug or alcohol-related arrests.Even your campus visits will be subject to NCAA regulation. You must be certified as eligible prior to visiting and the college can only pay for a handful of your expenses, such as transportation.For example, you could be considered guilty of a moral violation if you are caught and found guilty of drinking underage. The same goes with any drug-related offenses.

, Once you’ve gotten that golden ticket, your job is not done. You’ll need to work hard in college in order to keep the funds coming in. Some football programs will offer one-year scholarships while others will grant a few multi-year ones as well. Ask lots of questions before signing and closely adhere to the scholarship’s rules while enrolled.Ask college officials about how you can use your scholarship monies. Are you able to buy books with these funds? Can it go toward the cost of renting an apartment or just a dorm? Also, find out what happens if you are injured or choose to transfer schools. Does the money disappear or will it continue?"

Reach out to college coaches.,
Ask your high school coaches for help.,
Know the recruiting calendars.,
Get advice before you commit.,
Sign a National Letter of Intent.",How to Get a Football Scholarship2," When you first decide that you want to play college football, sit down and make a list of the schools that best fit your abilities and interest. Take into account the school’s location, the team’s future potential and history, and the academic offerings. Use this list as the starting point for reaching out to programs and coaches.It may be helpful to organize your list according to interest level. Place your top choice program in the #1 position and move down from there. Be prepared to adjust the list over time., As you consider schools you’ll need to decide whether or not to go after a NCAA Division I program or look at a Division II or Division III option. Division I offers the most full-scholarships for football, however, it also the most competitive. Division III, on the other hand, is a good option for student-athletes interested in balancing out academics and sports.You can find out more information about these divisions as well as the number of scholarships awarded by going to the NCAA website.

, Call, email, or send a letter to those coaches who direct football programs that are of high interest to you. Introduce yourself and be as specific as you can regarding what attracts you to their program. Get ahold of them as a freshman or sophomore so that you’ll be on their radar later on.For example, instead of saying, “I think your program is great,” you might say, “I really admire your consistently high-performing offensive line.”
Be formal and refer to the coaches by their last name, unless by them told to do otherwise. So, say, “Coach Farris,” or “Mr. Farris.”

, Your current coaches can offer suggestions regarding strong and suitable college football programs. They can also contact college coaches to discuss your potential. If other football players from your high school have gone on to play college ball, your coach can reach out to them as well for assistance.To approach your coach you might say, “I’m really interested in playing college ball, where do you think I would fit in?”

, College coaches follow specific rules regarding when, and how, they are able to contact potential students. To more fully understand the recruiting process and make the most of these contacts, go the NCAA website and look over the recruiting calendars posted there. College coaches will also expect you to be informed regarding these rules.In the contact period, a college coach will interact with recruits face-to-face and over the phone. In the evaluation period, a college coach may watch the recruit play a game, but will not approach them. In the quiet period, a college coach may not talk to a recruit face-to-face or visit their high school. However, the coach can also call the recruit. In the dead period, a college coach’s contact is severely limited., When you are presented with a contract, or any paperwork, have your coaches and parents look it over as well. Read all of the fine print to see if there is anything concerning. Look for any areas of possible negotiation as well.


For example, if a college coach is pressed they may be able to extend a guaranteed scholarship for additional months, such as extending a six-month period into a full year's ride.

, The process of landing a football scholarship will end with you committing to a college and signing an official Letter of Intent. This is a contract between the school and you. They will give you a scholarship in return for you attending their school for at least a year. Most of these contracts are signed by the start of February at the latest.If you change your mind and wish to attend a different school be aware that you may lose a full year of eligibility.
Be cautious with verbal agreements during the recruiting process. A coach may make verbal promises to you, but they are not binding. You may also verbally agree to attend a college, but that statement is not binding either."
"
Do your best every game.,
Attend training camps and combines.,
Make a highlight film.,
Work with a recruiting company.,
Sign on with a training facility.",How to Get a Football Scholarship3," At the end of the day, your athletic prowess is the chief factor determining whether or not you will receive a scholarship. You must play hard every game and you must play as many games are you are able to. Try to be a team player as well in order to show that you will work well with new teammates.

, In the summer before your senior year, if not earlier, make sure to attend as many football camps and showcases (also known as combines) as you can. Try to target those camps sponsored or held by colleges that you are interested in. In some cases you will need to have your coach send in a recommendation for you.These camps are also where your “measurables” will be determined. These are personal measurements of your vertical leap, 40-yard dash, and height/weight. Recruiting services, such as ESPN, will post these stats to their main websites., This is a commonly recognized part of the recruiting process for every sport, including football. Put together a video of your best plays. It should be five minutes or less. You can put this together yourself using basic video software. Post the video to YouTube and email the coaches the link.College coaches will often ignore videos that last too long or are too elaborate. For example, don’t use slow motion graphics or dramatic music.Make sure to include your email on the last frame of the video.

, There are companies and individuals, who you can contact online, who will handle the process of reaching out to college football coaches for you. They will also provide you advice regarding camps, combines, and NCAA regulations. However, be aware that they will charge a fee for these services and it can vary greatly.


Be aware that some coaches can view recruiters as an unnecessary middleman., Search your local area for an athletic training site that specializes in working with professional or pre-professional athletes. These trainers can often offer assistance with reaching out to college coaches. They can also help you to improve your skills which can aid in recruitment as well."

, Things such as jumping rope, jogging/sprinting, and actually playing help increase your athletic ability and make you a better running back overall.

, It is just a game and it's not the end of the world if you don't get as good as you want to be. It may simply be that your expectations are too high.

, Straight line speed, acceleration, and lateral agility is crucial to dodge defenders and get to the endzone, or even just make it to the sidelines to stop the clock. It doesn't matter how big or small you are, if you can't get away from defenders, you'll never reach where you want to be.

, Tuck the ball as close to your body as possible. Give defenders as little chance to knock the ball away as possible. And if you have to catch the ball on a screen pass or if you have to return a punt, learn to catch the ball with both hands first before you are doing one-handed grabs for the camera.

, It doesn't matter how little you are, even if you are the fastest man on turf, you will still get tackled. You will get gang-tackled by 2 or 3 people trying to bring you down. Protecting the ball is more important, but being able to take the hits, lay a strong stiff-arm and shed tackles is just as important. Bulking up can help you become a better blocker as well, as running backs are sometimes used for extra pass-protection.

, It doesn't matter if you are trying to keep your knees from hitting the ground from the first tackle, or if you are trying to stay in bounds, you can avoid some injuries, too.

, You have to read the defense as well as your quarterback. Sometimes, you may even have to break up a supposed outside run and you must run inside (or vice versa).

You can probably figure out what is healthy for yourself. However if you need some help you should check with a nutritionist to see what is healthy.






Also a common misconception is that fats aren't healthy at all. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. UNHEALTHY FATS ARE UNHEALTHY.
Some of the things that are healthy sources of fat are olive oil, fish oil, vegetable oil, and some peanut butters.






The diet is one of the most important factors of the bulking phase so you don't want to waste it by wasting your food.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Trim the mouthguard for length.,
Submerge the mouthguard in boiling water.,
Remove the mouthguard carefully.,
Place the mouthguard in the ice water.",How to Fit a Mouth Guard," To properly fit your mouthguard, you'll need:


your mouthguard
scissors
enough boiling water to submerge the mouthguard in
a bowl of ice water
a towel;
, You may need to trim the ends to make sure your mouthguard fits comfortably and doesn't irritate the back of your mouth. Put it in before you fit it and trim a bit off the ends if necessary. If it pokes into your mouth at the back of your jaw, or causes you to gag, trim off a little using scissors.









A mouthguard is mostly used to protect your vulnerable front teeth, not your molars, so you've got some wiggle-room as far as the back of the mouthguard goes. Some athletes prefer a more comfortable and short guard that covers the teeth as far as the first molars. Do what's comfortable.

, You need enough boiling water to submerge the mouthguard in it for between 30 and 60 seconds. Start a small pot of boiling water on the stove, or boil some in the microwave.









Holding the mouthguard carefully by the end strap, submerge it in the water and let it soften. If your mouthguard doesn't have a strap, or you already cut it off, you can just drop it in the water and retrieve it with a slotted spoon.
If you have braces, or other dental prosthetics, boil the water for only around 30 seconds. You want the mouthguard to fit your mouth, but not to fill in the crannies around your braces, which can damage them.

, Quickly blot the mouthguard on the towel and get it into your mouth, adjusting it against your upper teeth. It won't be uncomfortably hot.









Using your thumbs, push the mouth guard up and back against your molars. Bite down firmly to get the impression of your teeth on the bottom of the mouthguard and suck the guard against your top teeth.
Place your tongue against the roof of the mouth to create pressure and achieve a tight fit around your teeth. This shouldn't take more than 15 or 20 seconds.
Don't chew the mouthguard or move it around in your mouth while you're fitting it.

, Remove the mouthguard and dunk it in the ice water. Let it cool for a minute or two and try the fit. It should fit snugly against your top teeth without having to hold it with your tongue, and it should fit naturally into your bottom teeth.









If you want to cut off the strap, you can do so now, or remove the removable strap.
If it feels uncomfortable or ill-fitting, try it again until you get a proper fit.

Obtain a foam roller.,
Find an exercise area.,
Prepare yourself for some muscle pain.,
Begin deep massage with the foam roller.,
Do a foam roller massage routine to target tight muscle groups.,
Pay attention to muscle tension.",How to Use a Foam Roller1," You may want to borrow a foam roller before you invest in your own.


Use a foam roller at the gym. If you cannot find a foam roller in the facility, ask the front desk. They may be located in the physical therapy or classroom section of the gym.
Borrow or buy a foam roller at a physical therapy office. Injured athletes frequently include foam rolling in their recovery routine. If you know someone who is a physical therapist, they may be able to loan you 1 for a short time.
Take a pilates class. Pilates studios keep foam rollers on hand and they often incorporate them into their core and stretching classes.
Buy a foam roller. Go to a local sports equipment store or look online. Get a high-density foam roller or a roller with a PVC core for maximum durability. They are available for $10 to $50.;
, You will need a flat space that is approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m) in order to stretch your body on the roller.

, The process of myofascial release, or self-massage, requires you to press down with your body weight on the soft tissue called fascia. The pain on tight muscles is akin to that experienced during Swedish massage.


Try to find a private space if you experience intense muscle pain. You will learn to control the level of pain by placing more or less body weight on the roller.
Focus on your tightest muscle groups. Although they will initially cause more pain, this is what the foam roller is designed to treat.

, Start by sitting on the floor with the foam roller beneath your bent knees. Begin with your hamstrings.


Place your arms behind you and rest the majority of your weight on the arms, keeping them right below your shoulders.
Lift your butt up and rest your hamstrings on the foam roller. It should sit right below your buttocks. This is at the beginning, or proximal, part of the muscle.
Allow the roller to move down slightly and back up. This is a short kneading motion that will target the fascia.
Glide the roller down the length of your hamstrings. Use smaller rolling, kneading motions, taking at least 1 minute to move the entire length of the muscle.
Control the amount of pressure and pain with your arms. Lower the arms or straighten them to adjust.
Massage the entire length of the muscle 3 to 4 times before moving on.

,

Move on to your calves, after you have done your hamstrings. Start just below the knee joint and massaging the entire length for 3 to 4 repetitions. Focus on particularly tight areas for longer, kneading them for 1 to 2 minutes before rolling the entire length of the muscle again.






Try the foam roller on your buttocks. Start at the top, just below the hip bones. Use kneading motions in the fleshiest parts of the muscle. For added targeting, get into figure 4 position, with your right shin resting on your left thigh as you roll. Switch sides and repeat.






Turn on your side and work on the muscles in the hips. Use your legs and elbow to keep you steady on your side as you work from the top of the hip down to the upper thigh.






Flip over onto the roller. Get into a plank position. Target your hip flexors and quadriceps.






Target tight spinal muscles with the roller. Begin at the bottom of the spine and move in short, gentle rolls toward the top, near the shoulders. #*You may hear cracking as tension is released. Do not try this area if you have severe spinal problems.







, Each person is different, so tailor your routine to the tightest muscles.


Assess when your muscles begin to release. You may find the pain is less acute or the muscle is suppler after rolling.
Repeat several times per week. Many athletes use rollers for massage every other day.

Practice longer runs on the track with hurdles.,
Eventually, practice your race.,
Preparing for your race

Make sure you eat a proper 'distance runners' meal' the night before your race.,
After the race: be sure to cool down and eat carbs and protein!",How to Train for Steeplechase," The first part of training for steeplechase is to build up your endurance. Whether you're running the 2000m or 3200, building up your endurance is the most important part of your training.


Start preparing early! Steeplechase is most popular in the spring, so start your distance/endurance training in early to mid winter.;
, There are 5 steeples (barriers) per lap that must be hurdled or jumped onto. Since these cannot be knocked over, it is easier to begin training with conventional hurdles.


Ask someone with experience for tips about doing drills and perfecting form.
There are many videos on YouTube that help people see what a good hurdling form is. It helps to record yourself hurdling and use it for comparison!







, Once per lap, the barrier will be in front of a water pit that you will try to clear. Although clearing the water pit every time takes many years of practice, having a strong leap off of the barrier in front of it will help tremendously.


Stride towards the barrier (on a track, turf field, sand pit, or other softer surface) and jump, landing on top with the heel of one foot. Roll your landing foot forward and spring off! Make sure your trail leg is still in correct hurdling form, or you'll hit the barrier and fall.

, Do intervals of 400m, alternating hurdling and not hurdling.

, Set up the barriers and water pit, and run as if you were in a race. Ideally, this should take place 1-2 weeks before your race.

,
Have the proper gear: most runners prefer spandex shorts (as they provide flexibility), a well-fitting tank top shirt, a towel, a supportive sports bra (for females), and steeplechase spikes (regular track spikes work fine too, but steeplechase spikes allow water drainage). Most runners will avoid wearing socks, as they become weighed down with water, and will even leave behind their underwear for the same reason!






Since steeple is usually the first event at track and field meets, be sure to arrive early to begin your warmup.







, Keep training for your next race.

,
Escaping pursuit:Measure 100–500 yards (91.4–457.2 m) and Sprint the distance as fast as possible.,
Leap of Faith:No you are not going to Jump 100 feet (30.5 m) off of a tower to land into a well-placed stack of hay (if you find one you may do so but it is not recommended).,
Fight like Eagle:If you have a punching bag, punch it for 10 minutes a day.,
Learn to handle a blade.Find a stick and practice slicing in 8 different directions with it and practice cutting in a figure 8 motion.,
Hiding from the Guards:Practice Stealth in almost every situation your in remember to walk silently and breath slowly.",How to Train Like Ezio Auditore Da Firenze,",, You can make the training even more realistic by having someone chase you.

, Instead, you are going to find a structure about 5–15 feet (1.5–4.6 m) off the ground and practice your landing techniques. When you land crouch as if you were doing a Squat and roll from your shoulder blade across your back. This cushions the impact.

, If you don't have one make one or shadowbox if you like. Fighting dirty is one of Ezio`s secrets.

, Look online for help

, Use visualization to imagine yourself being chased or you stalking an enemy. Playing tag would help.

Join a javelin program.",How to Throw a Spear," You can still find spears available in certain stores. It might be easier to look online for a throwing spear, but some sporting stores with hunting equipment sometimes carry spears.


Examine your throwing spear for safety. If the spearhead is loose, the shaft is damaged, or other problems you shouldn’t use or buy the spear.
Be sure your spear is a throwing spear. There are many different types of spears. Spears designed for throwing are usually lightweight and have a slim profile.;
, The balance point is found usually 2/3rds of the way towards the point. Place the middle of the spear in the palm of your hand. Move it until you find the balance point. You will reach the balance point when the spear does not waver and is balanced without gripping the spear.


Mark the balancing point with a marker for an easy reminder.

, Use a full grip on the balancing point of the spear. Use your fingers to grasp the shaft of the spear while your thumb rides along the bottom. You could also use your thumb to grasp the shaft as well. It is a matter of preferences., Once you’ve established the balance point and a comfortable grip, you’re ready to throw. Hold the spear up to your ear so it is parallel with the ground. This will allow you to align your sight with the tip of the spear.

, Take one step towards the target in order to gain momentum for your throw. Face slightly sideways from the target with your spear held in your dominant hand., The T-stance is a martial arts stance where your body resembles the letter ""T."" If you are right-handed, the left foot should be positioned towards the target. If you are left-handed, the right foot should be positions towards the target. Keep your feet about shoulder-length apart. Your knees should be loose and bent slightly. Use your other arm to keep you steady.

, There are three areas to focus on during your throw: speed, angle and height. When achieved your spear will sling from the combined effort of your body, as opposed to just throwing it with your am. You can generate a proper speed by running a few steps before releasing the spear.


After generating speed, pull your throwing arm back with your hand a bit higher than your shoulder's height., The spear must move from behind your head to the release point in a straight line. Keep the spear’s shaft close to your body at all times during the throw. Twist forward with your hips and launch the spear forward at the same time. You should feel your throwing shoulder drop and your opposite hand go out behind you.


Take one side-step forward to increase the momentum of the spear's impact.
As you throw, turn your body slightly sideways to create a release angle that will benefit the ""sling"" of your spear.The height of your release should be slightly above your shoulders.

, A powerful throw is nothing without a proper follow through. Allow your body to react to throwing the spear. Don’t over exaggerate anything and compromise the straight line of flight for your spear.


The proper follow through will increase the accuracy of your throw.

, Be sure there is no chance of people, cars, domestic animals, or the like that can enter into your practice area. Choose somewhere in the wilderness away from people to avoid any mistakes. Be sure there is no property nearby that could be damaged like windows, cars, pool sides, or the like. etc., Generally, select a soft target to avoid damaging your spear. This also avoids a ricochet. Wooden targets should be saved until you have gotten the hang of throwing a powerful throw.Good targets include:


Hay bales
Commercial targets (although these are usually designed for firearms or archery).
Soft earth. A grassy lawn is good for practicing throwing techniques for distance.

, Like any weapon, you must treat this spear as a force to be reckoned with. If you play around with the spear and aren’t careful, you could jeopardize somebody’s life., If you bought spearheads to be attached to the shaft or have a similar object around, practice with it. You can still find the balance point and practice your stance without the sharp edge. Like the regular spear, you should also take care in handling your practice spear. Look for rubber tipped spearheads for an authentic feel and throw.


A spear without an edge can still harm others or damage property. The spear works mainly on concentrated force, and while the spearhead facilitates damage, it will certainly do damage without it.
A spear without a spearhead is still a spear. It is not safe, or disarmed.

, Some people learn better with a knowledgeable guide. Although it sounds simple, throwing a spear properly takes skill, technique, a knowledge of your materials, and safety procedures. The spear throwing community is small so look into Renaissance festivals and cosplay groups. Some colleges may have anthropologists who have studied various primitive techniques as well.


You can learn on your own as well. But this will usually involve a lot of trial and error and bad technique can be hard to ""un-learn"".

, Many schools have javelin throwers as part of their track and field team. Throwing a javelin is similar to throwing a spear. Joining a javelin team will train you for competitive throwing. There are even programs and associations for various track and field events created for adults, or those outside of school.


Javelin training will prepare you for the spear throwing stances, grips, and other tactics.

Assess the terrain of the course.,
Determine the entire length of the course.,
Identify the kinds of obstacles on your course.,
Verify the number of obstacles.",How to Train for an Obstacle Course Race1," Terrain can have a considerable effect on the effort you expend. Running in sand, for example, will be more difficult than running on firm ground. Cross country running will have more ups and downs, which will be more work than running on a flat track.


If there is an aquatic portion to the course, note this in as well. Running through low level water will require more exertion.
Most obstacle race courses offer a general description of the course. In some cases, the actual location of the course may be listed on the race’s homepage.
If you know the location your race will be run, visit it. This will give you a much fuller grasp of what you’ll be up against.;
, Though the obstacles of a course form a significant hurdle for participants, you’ll also have to run the entire length to finish the race. The shortest race, generally, is a 5 km (3.1 mi), but other common distances include 8, 10, and 12 mi (12.9, 16, and 19.3 km).The overall length of your course can be found on the homepage of the race you are running. In many cases, you’ll have to choose a distance when signing up for the event.

, These will determine the exercises you’ll use to train. For example, if there are a lot of climbing obstacles, you’ll want to focus on developing your climbing muscles, doing things like pullups and chin ups. Although there are many unique obstacles, you can generally divide obstacles into four categories:


Climbing obstacles may have you doing things like swinging across monkey bars, scaling a wall, or climbing across a transverse rope.
Courage obstacles generally require less effort, but more bravery. Some common ones include cliff jumps (usually into water), zip lines, rope swings, and large slides.
Agility obstacles can take many forms. You could be stepping into empty tires for some distance, crawling under a low screen, or balancing on a narrow platform.
Endurance obstacles are rarely difficult to perform, but will usually push the limits of your perseverance. These include things like sandbag carrying, log hauling, and more., Depending on the event you’ve signed up for, the number of obstacles may vary significantly. In most cases, the more obstacles you must complete, the more difficult the course will be overall. While checking the total number, determine the amount in each category.


Knowing how many obstacles are in each category will give you a better idea of where to focus your training. For example, if most of the obstacles are climbing oriented, you’ll want to focus on developing your climbing muscles.

Set up an exercise area.,
Prepare your body for stability exercises.,
Do a plank.,
Do abdominal exercises on the foam roller.,
Do a lunge.",How to Use a Foam Roller2," Grab an exercise mat on a flat surface. You can leave your shoes on, or use it with bare feet.

, Warm up with 5 minutes of cardio before you work your back and stomach muscles.

, Get into a pushup position on the mat.


A plank position is the same as a pushup position, where your body weight is resting on your feet and hands. Your body should form a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, while your core muscles work to keep you stabilized in this position. Get out of the position, while you ready the foam roller for use in an advanced plank position.
Place the foam roller on the mat where your hands will be. Get into plank position with your hands pressing down on the foam roller. It should be more difficult, because the foam roller tries to move. You will get extra benefit by working the muscles harder while you hold the position.
You can also do the plank position on your forearms. Clasp your hands together and make sure your elbows are directly below your shoulders as they rest on the foam roller. This is a slightly easier variation, because you do not have to keep the entire length of your arms stable. However, it is easier on the wrist and shoulder joints.
Hold the plank for 1 minute. You can also do advanced push ups in this position.
Move the foam roller to the bottom of your mat. Try the plank and push up while your feet stabilize the roller.

, Place the roller parallel with your spine. You should feel some instability with side-to-side motion.


Stabilize yourself with your feet while you do crunches or twisting oblique exercises.
Stabilize yourself with 1 foot (0.3 m) at a time, during lower abdominal exercises. Keep your upper body lifted off the foam roller from the shoulders upward.

, Place your foam roller slightly behind you while you stand on your mat.


Stand with your feet hip width apart. Place your body weight on your left leg and you reach your toes back to rest on the foam roller.
Bend your left knee and roll the foam roller back, balancing with your left leg.
Repeat on the opposite side 5 to 10 times. This exercise will improve balance when done 2 to 3 times per week.

Roll around with your back on the roller.,
If the pain makes you want to get of, do it.,
Relax.,
If the muscle hurts the next day or if another muscle hurts, repeat the technique on that muscle and soon you will get used to doing this.",How to Use a Foam Roller3," Keep rolling and using it to massage yourself until you find a painful knot. Stay on the knot for a while and concentrate on the pain., You only need to keep your muscle on that roller as long as you can bear it., If the muscle you just massaged is in pain or feels weird, rest it. Usually after you use this method the muscle you used it on will be a little sour., It's actually easy to get used to pain or something painful it you put your mind to it."

Practice for crawling obstacles with the bear crawl.,
Train for climbing obstacles with pullups.,
Do back flyes in place of pullups, alternatively.,
Strengthen your chest with pushups.,
Run over terrain similar to the obstacle course.",How to Train for an Obstacle Course Race2," Start in a normal pushup or plank position. Keep your fingers pointed out and your hands slightly farther than shoulder width apart. Balance on your toes. Keep your hips low in relation to the ground and in line with your head and shoulders. From there, crawl normally.When learning the bear crawl and building your crawling muscles, you may want to use your knees to offer a little support.
Beginners at the bear crawl should start with relatively short distances. As it becomes easier, increase the distance little by little until you can crawl 10 to 20 yards (9.1 to 18.2 m).
Generally, you should do three sets of this exercise over the course of a workout. Allow yourself at least 30 seconds of rest time in between sets., Find a pullup bar or a suitable, level support that can support your body weight and be gripped onto easily. Adopt an overhand grip, with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Keep your back straight and your lower body extended, then pull yourself up until your chin is just above the bar. Lower yourself slowly until your arms are fully extended.Pullups can be very difficult, especially for beginners. Get some assistance with your pullups by having a friend grasp your legs and help you with the pulling up motion.
A variation of the pullup, the chin up, uses an underhand grip. This is another great climbing work out, and is performed the same as the pullup with the exception of the grip.

, Grasp a weight in each of your hands. Lean forward until your back is aligned parallel with the ground. From a hanging position, lift your arms upward as far as you can. Slowly return your arms to your side. Repeat this motion several times.


When your arms are fully extended, both arm should be reaching out to either side of you like wings. Try to keep your neck relaxed for the duration of this exercise.
If you don’t have weights, you can use household items, like canned goods, doorstops, or books as substitute weights., Position yourself on your hands and knees. Your hands should be slightly more than shoulder width apart and flat on the floor. Extend your legs and balance on your toes. Keep your body straight. Lower yourself until you’re almost touching the ground, then push yourself back into your starting position.


It’s very easy to lose good form while doing pushups. You may want to have a friend watch you to make sure you keep your body straight and even.
If in the beginning a traditional pushup is too difficult, rest your weight slightly on your knees for support. As you build strength, adopt the normal position., Even if you find the obstacles on your course a cinch, you’ll still have to run the entire distance to complete the course. Train on terrain that is similar to that of the course you’ll be running. For example:If you’ll be running on a traditional cross country course, trail running would be great practice.
Running up tall hills or mountains can be trained for by running through hilly country or running on a treadmill with the incline set to high.
Arid or sandy running can be simulated by runs on the beach.

Set your schedule.,
Build your endurance.,
Train your strength.,
Combine strength and endurance maneuvers.",How to Train for an Obstacle Course Race3," If you’re in good shape and have run an obstacle course race before, 4 weeks of training should be sufficient. For beginners, 90 days of training will prepare you best. High level athletes should train 5 days per week, while beginners will benefit most from a 3 day a week schedule.


Generally, you should plan on working on endurance one day, strength another, and combining those two aspects on a third day.
If you have an active daily schedule, you may want to plan your workouts for the evening or early in the morning.

, Warm up with a light jog for about 400 m (¼ mi). Take a stopwatch or a timer on your phone and set it for 5 minutes. In that time, do 10 burpees and run another 400 m (¼ mi). Repeat this process about 6 times.


Take about 5 minutes of rest time between your sets of burpees and running.
Increase the difficulty of this workout by finishing off with 100 m (109 yd) of lunges., Do a light warm up to prevent straining a muscle. Choose the heaviest weight you can manage for each exercise while keeping good form and performing at least 5 reps per set. Do 5 sets of 5 reps for each of the following exercises:


Squat
Push press

Deadlift, You’ll have to use both your strength and endurance to conquer the obstacle course race you’ll be competing in. Coordinating these two in your workout schedule will help you integrate them when the time comes to run your race.



Option 1: Alternate between 400 m (437 yd), 21 kettleball swings, and 12 pullups. Do a total of 3 sets of these exercises.

Option 2: Alternate between rowing for 500 m (547 yd) and bench press your bodyweight 10 times. Do this for 5 sets. You may need a spotter while doing the bench press if you are unsure of your ability to complete 10 reps at your bodyweight."

Be careful with strong hair products.",How to Take Care of Swimmer's Hair1," Chlorine – which is used to kill bacteria in pool water and keep it swimmable – will strip the natural oils that usually help protect your hair from damage associated with dryness and daily wear. The goal of swimmer’s hair treatment is maintaining a healthy level of moisture in your mane.The first must-do step is to shower immediately after your swim. Chemicals are beginning to damage your hair as soon as you jump in. Fight back as soon as you get out of the pool!
For added resilience, use moisturizing conditioner and shampoo.
Massage moisturizing hair products into your hair and scalp to ensure complete coverage of your hair.
A moisturizing “leave-in” conditioner can help making brushing go more smoothly.;
, If your hair sometimes changes colors – blondes may go a bit green, and darker-haired people may see their hair lighten in color – there are shampoos designed to specifically fights this effect.Mineral deposits such as copper are actually the culprits associated with color changes in your hair.
There are products specifically designed to rid your hair of copper before it sets in, such as chelating shampoos that lower the pH of your hair and remove the copper.

, Even hair products meant to treat swimmer’s hair may dry your hair out when you first begin to use them.Chlorine, for all its disinfectant glory, will bond to your hair, so you may need more than your run-of-the-mill cleaning products to get it out.

You should go to a doctor or medical facility if you have any of the following signs:


Severe pain, swelling or numbness
The inability to tolerate any weight on the area
The ache of an old injury has suddenly developed increased swelling
If you have an obvious abnormality with a joint or bone
If you have a severe laceration or excess bleeding that will not stop;
, If you haven’t experienced any of the above signs and symptoms, start self-treatment as soon as possible after the injury has occurred.


Rest. Do not attempt to continue with the activity to “work through it,” as this may cause additional damage to the injured area. You will need to rest for several days, and up to several weeks, depending on the severity of your injury. Avoid using the affected area until you feel that you have recovered enough to avoid re-injury or irritation.
Use ice on the injury. Apply an ice pack four to eight times daily for 20 minutes at a time. Do not leave ice on your body for more than 20 minutes at a time in order to avoid frostbite or skin injury. Instead of putting ice directly on the skin, wrap it in a towel or cloth. Hot/cold packs can be purchased and the directions should be followed accordingly. When ice is applied to a swollen area, the blood vessels will become smaller in diameter, which will limit the amount of blood that is exposed to the injured area. This helps in the healing process. The ice will also help to numb the pain.
Use compression on the injury. If swelling occurs, light compression can help to reduce swelling. It will help to prevent blood and fluid from entering the injured area.
Elevate your injury. If you have injured an area such as the ankle, knee, elbow or wrist, elevating it will decrease the swelling to the area. Prop the injured area on a pillow or soft object for comfort.
Immobilize the injured area. You may need to prevent the affected area from too much movement, depending on the location. Once you have initiated the treatment process and during times when you are not elevating the area, use a sling, splint, or immobilizer to prevent further injury to the area.
Use medication. Over the counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can help tremendously. They not only work for pain but on the healing process itself. Inflammation occurs immediately following an injury and these medications will help to prevent too much of this. Examples include: ibuprofen, aspirin and Naproxen Sodium. Another over the counter medication is acetaminophen, which also helps in reduction in pain.
Use heat after 48 hours. Once swelling is controlled, usually in 48 hours, heat can be applied for comfort and to help with the healing process. Heat can increase the blood flow to the area, which helps to remove cell debris from the damaged tissues, thus helping with the healing process.
Use pain patches and topical ointments. There are several types of over the counter numbing patches and pain topical ointments that may help to relieve pain. Use these as needed and if they do not interfere with healing. The injury should be closed if these are used to prevent infection.

Use olive oil to treat your hair.,
Try vinegar.,
Try a vitamin C hair treatment.,
Give your hair the raw egg treatment.,
Lather your hair in mayo!",How to Take Care of Swimmer's Hair2," Especially helpful in treating hair damaged by chlorine, olive oil adds substantial moisture to your hair and almost immediately ups its softness and shininess.Pour ½ a cup of olive oil into a bowl that you can safely microwave, and heat it for 20 seconds.
Using a towel to protect your clothing (or while wearing your birthday suit), massage warm oil into your hair a bit at a time.
Continue dabbing your fingers into the bowl and coating your hair until every strand is covered.
Leave the olive oil in your hair for 30 minutes before shampooing and conditioning as usual.

, Vinegar is especially effective in increasingly shine and in removing buildup from your hair that may have left behind by pool chemicals.Vinegar will also help diminish chemical smells and even help prevent discoloration of your hair.Make a vinegar treatment by putting 2 cups of cider vinegar into a glass receptacle for which you have a lid.
Add 10 drops of an essential oil of your choice and gently shake the glass to mix.
Cap the solution and allow it to sit and blend for at least 24 hours.
Add ½ a tablespoon of the vinegar mixture to 1 cup of water.
Simply rinse pool-damaged hair following your next shampoo and allow the mixture to soak in.

, A vitamin C and club soda tonic will remove chlorine and other buildups from your hair.Mix a ¼ cup of club soda and a ¼ cup each of grapefruit, orange, and lemon juices in a spray bottle.
If your hair reaches beneath your shoulders, up these ingredients by an 1/8th cup each.
Add a drop or two of sage essential oil for your bottle for extra vitality and sheen with your restore.
Spray the mixture onto wet hair. (If you just swam, rinse in clean water first.)
Comb the spray through your hair until strands are evenly covered.
Leave your hair alone for about three minutes before shampooing and conditioning as usual.
For supremely damaged hair, repeat this treatment every two to three weeks.
You can also purchase the equivalent citrusy product pre-mixed and packaged., Since the protein content of egg is especially high, this will help strengthen your hair shafts and make your mane shiny and silky to the touch.Crack an egg into a bowl and mix it with a fork.
Stir in a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of plain yogurt. (Stir well!)
Massage the mixture into a handful of clean, damp hair.
Build a recovery chamber for your hair by covering it all with a plastic shower cap.
Allow the mixture to sit in damaged hair for 30 minutes before washing with cool water.

, Since mayo contains a lot of eggs and a lot of oil, mayonnaise provides the protein that can help strengthen your hair, and the moisture that can help repair a dried out hairdo.Prep your hair for the mayo treatment by wetting it with warm water and wrapping your hair in a towel prior to application.
Put about 2 tablespoons of mayo in a bowl and use this to liberally apply mayo directly to your scalp, massaging it in with your fingertips.
Working your way from the scalp, coat all of your hair.
Wrap your hair in a plastic bag or shower cap and leave the mayo in your hair for 20 minutes before rinsing thoroughly.

Protect your hair while you swim!,
Take care when putting on and removing your swim cap.,
Coat your hair before you jump in.",How to Take Care of Swimmer's Hair3," A swim cap is a great way to limit your hair’s exposure to harmful pool chemicals, though you must both put on and take caps off carefully. Either way, wet your hair with clean water before entering a pool (even if you’re going to wear a cap).To up your defenses, take a quick shower, put some conditioner in your hands right after and run them through your hair before a swim.
Saturate your hair with water to slow (and hopefully prevent) the absorption of harmful chemicals such as chlorine.

, If you wear a swim cap, be very careful taking it on and off, as the grip of the cap on your hair can easily pull strands out of your scalp.Gather your hair close to your head, twisting and tying up long hair into a loose bun on top of your head.
Place your hands inside the cap, with your palms vertical and your fingers spread.
Let the front inside edge of the cap catch your forehead as you slowly lower the cap over your hair and around the back of your head.
If you have trouble with latex caps pulling your hair, switch to a Lycra of silicone cap. These materials will pull your hair much less.
Be gentle adjusting and removing your cap. If repositioning, do so very gently. When removing, start at either the front or back edge, pull out and away from your head, and keep pulling out and away from your head as you rotate your hand around your head.

, The best treatment is prevention. Oil and silicone-based products are best. The realm of oils includes natural products and remedies, while silicone can help calm frizziness and provide extra protection if you aggressively style your hair when out of the pool.Coconut oil, applied liberally, is a great pre-swim option. Massage it into clean, damp locks.
Use a conditioner or leave-in treatment with silicone polymers such as dimethicone or cyclomethicone.Wetting and coating your hair will also make it easier to put on a swim cap without damaging your hair.
Some products even help protect your hair from sun and salt as well as chlorine – so wherever you’re swimming, you’ll be covered.

Evaluate the options for chronic injury treatment.",How to Treat Sports Injuries2," Depending on your injury, you may need continued treatment until the problem totally resolves or ongoing if the problem becomes chronic. This sometimes involves physical therapy, chiropractic care or alternative treatments. There are various treatment regimens for chronic injuries. These include:


Spinal manipulation: Manipulating or moving certain joints and muscles by a trained professional can help in pain reduction.
Ultrasound: Deep heat is produced by high frequency sound waves.
Strengthening exercises: making the areas around an injury stronger can sometimes help ease stress off of the injury.
Massage therapy: Manual rubbing can soothe and relieve pain.
Water therapy: Monitored exercise in water can help in strengthening.
Electrostimulation: A mild electrical current provides pain relief by preventing nerves from sending pain signals to the brain.

Bet ""parlays.""",How to Survive Sportsbetting," In the United States, football and basketball fit the bill. These sports get a lot of action and there is a lot of research that can be had from these sports such as news, sports services, TV replays and sports websites.;
, Spreads and Totals are the bets with the least disadvantage. The 11/10 (-110 for American style betting and 1.90 in decimal form) betting structure is common for spreads and totals. The disadvantage, known as the ""vig,"" allows bookkeepers to make their profits. It is simply a part of sportsbetting that must be accepted, and is actually smaller than you may think.

, The formula for determining the break-even point is: 11 / (11+10) = 52.38%. Winning more than 52.38% out of 100 games is profitable, and put this way the casino advantage does not seem too big.

, These will show the pattern of wins and losses. Suggestions are: 50%, 54% and 57%. The results will look like this for a 54% win percentage (which is profitable): W, W, W, L, W, L, W, L, L, W, L, W. A free online random number generator is the best choice, because eventually, pulling colored slips of paper, with 54 blue and 46 yellow, out of a barber shop hat gets tiring and slow.

, A bettor on vacation has a short time frame and he might make just 10 wagers on basketball. Divide the data in groups of 10 and analyze the results in terms of profit.

, Long term results will show many long winning and losing streaks. When winning do not quit your day job and when losing - persevere.

, Bet on football and basketball. Bet on half - times lines and small edges. Fluctuations are kinder on the bettor with a higher win percentage.

,, A parlay is a single wager on 2 or more teams that gives you a larger reward than if the bets were made separately. This is a true way to ""get rich quick,"" as it offers high reward for lower risk. The more teams you bet, the higher the reward if the wager is won.

Squirt the drink directly into the mouth.",How to Share a Drink Without Spreading Germs2," To avoid removing the lid entirely, you can poke a hole in the lid of the drink and pour the liquid directly into your mouth without touching the lid.


To poke a hole in the lid, use a sharp tool (like a knife or fork) and apply pressure to the top of the lid. Be extremely careful when doing this, it is easy to slip and accidentally cut yourself. Do this on a solid surface and always cut away from yourself.

, A squeeze bottle can more easily be controlled if pouring the liquid directly into a mouth without touching the rim. The liquid can be more easily controlled to make for a neater drinking experience.


A squeeze bottle may be more efficient than using bottle with a lid with a hole poked in it.

, Hold the bottle above your mouth, about 6 inches away from your lips. Squeeze lightly if the liquid does not fall due to gravity. Be careful not to touch the bottle to your lips or mouth to avoid spreading germs. Do not squeeze too hard or you might spill your drink!

Consider with whom you are sharing.,
Pour the drink into glasses.,
Pour the drink into a single glass.",How to Share a Drink Without Spreading Germs3," Thomas Connley, DDS, recommends a good rule of thumb is to not share drinks with someone you wouldn’t kiss on the lips.This will limit the person you are sharing drinks, and germs, with.


There are many diseases, like mono or even meningitis you can contract by sharing drinks.At the same time, consider whether or not you really know this person's health history. A lot of people can be ill and not even know it. For instance, the person may have never had a cold sore, but may in fact be a carrier of the virus (it is estimated that 90% of adults carry the virus)., A simple way to share a drink with your friends is pouring the liquid in clean, separate glasses. This shares the drink without worry of cross contamination. Enjoy a drink with your friend, but do not enjoy each other’s germs!


If you are worried about splitting the drink in equal parts, first pour the drink in a measuring cup to measure exactly how much liquid each glass is receiving.

, You can pour a single drink in a glass before sharing it with a friend. There are a few ways to share a drink with a friend from a single glass.


Use straws. This may allow you to isolate your germs to just your straw where your mouth meets the straw. However, there may still be germs from your saliva in the drink.

Label disc cones with the numbers 1-7.
,





Set up your offense.,Place a cone to mark the 7 starting spots of the Motion Offense.,
Inform players of the following options that the ball carrier has in the motion offense:

Going to goal
Passing to an adjacent
Switching Positions

,
Start with the play setup.,
If the ball carrier does not have a clear path to goal, she stall the play by getting into one of the seven spots and wait for her teammates to set up Motion.

,

Explain to the ball carrier that the next option should be a look to pass.,
After the ball carrier has passed it to an adjacent, have the previous ball carrier make a cut towards goal.,
Have the ball carriers continue to pass to their left or right adjacent, then cutting towards the goal.,
If a player is having a hard time getting the ball to her adjacent, she can also switch her location in the motion offense.,
Off-ball players can switch places with other off-ball players as well.,
Be the first player to all ground balls.,
Be patient.",How to Run the Motion Offense in Lacrosse,", Each position in the Motion Offense is assigned a number. Facing the middle of the field: The left of the goal is #1, the right of the goal is #2, then numbers increase  from 3 to 7 counter-clockwise balancing around  the 12-meter arch.,,, During a transition from midfield to offense, the ball carrier should look to go to goal as her first option. If the opposing defense is not set up yet, she could have an easy opportunity to shoot or draw a shooting space foul.,, The ball carrier has 2 options when passing. Those two options include passing to the player to her left or passing to the player to her right. Passing to any player other than an adjacent is a risky pass and could be intercepted or deflected by the opposing defender. Passes should be quick, clean and direct. Lobbed passes could also be intercepted by a defender.

If you are a player who does not have the ball and is not directly adjacent to the ball carrier, you should be paying attention to the location of the ball. Keep the offense balanced around the 12 meter arch to create space for passing, movement and cuts.

, They now become ""the cutter"". The cutter should be running close to full speed into the 8-meter arch in front of the goal, looking for a pass from the now-ball carrier.

If the ball carrier does not have a clean pass to the cutter, the cutter will continue running to the outside of the 8 meter arch. They will find a new spot in the Motion while the other players balance out the rest of the set-up.

, The ball should be moving fast, only staying with one player for 3-5 seconds before being passed to the next adjacent., Communication is key within the offense, so let your teammates know by yelling ""switch"". Your teammates will know that you are moving and will be looking out for opportunities to receive a pass., Any movement that the offense does requires the defense to focus attention on the motion offense., If you or a teammate drops the ball while in motion, make sure you hustle the hardest to win back the ground ball., Working the Motion Offense can take time. Do not rush and force passes or shots, as bad shots and bad passes are easily recovered by the opposing team."

For example, you should offer low group sizes, personalized help and special classes to cater to age groups or injuries, if there are a large number of boot camp classes at gyms in the area. These features allow clients to burn more calories and avoid injury while feeling better about their workout.

, If you offer discounts or packages without a superior class design, you will be unlikely to keep your customers. Most gyms can offer better package prices with boot camps than privately run classes.


Consider rest periods, set length, class progression and standards of achievement.

, Share the features and benefits with your area. Come up with a message and call to action and communicate it through flyers, radio ads, television ads, online coupons and service partnerships.

, You are likely to need yoga mats, small hand weights, jump ropes, suspension ropes, towels and water. These should be included in your original business plan, along with plans to increase equipment when you start to profit.

, You can start your boot camp with a single group and expand as you receive referrals. Many fitness boot camps take place outside in parks. During the winter, you may be able to run it in a collective space or another fitness business for a small fee.

, You may not need to offer courses all day long. Boot camps are generally offered in the early morning, lunch time and after work to allow people with busy schedules to make it. If you have a lot of stay-at-home mothers and fathers, you can consider offering mid-day classes and day care.

, People become repeat customers to fitness boot camps when they feel supported and encouraged while they get fit. Structure short competitions and team-based tasks that will be positive and never degrading.

, Adjust the itinerary for the people and the day. Most customers cannot get this kind of personalized treatment in a gym, so get creative. Do anything to avoid the ""one size fits all"" approach.

, Running a good fitness boot camp requires you to be social. You should request information about injuries and ask questions in a friendly way before, during and after class.

, This is an exceptional way to do targeted marketing.

, Any successful fitness business must adjust schedules, hire instructors and change with the demographics in the area. Review your classes, staff, equipment and client feedback monthly, quarterly and yearly.

Work as a team!,
Keep stealthy!,
Do not maintain the same position throughout the entire war!,
Always listen to the squad leader's orders.,
Watch for snipers!,
Buy a good gun.,
Be alert of everything around you.,
Think before you do!",How to Win an Airsoft War," The only way to win against opponent is to work as a team! Buy walkie-talkies in order to help to communicate easily throughout the battlefield so that you can co-operate.;
, Stealthy people in Airsoft are the ones to succeed the most! Instead of running loudly around just maintain low profile and move slowly but steadily. If you are a squad leader than research hand signals. These are useful when your enemy is nearby. It saves you talking and aids in keeping stealthy.

, Your opponents will find it easy to find you, overrun you and finally hunt you down. When you move make sure to watch and listen carefully. React to any suspicious sound near you.

, Squad Leader is a very tough role and requires a great deal of stress management and confidence. Make sure the Squad Leader is well trained and understands the role.

, Snipers are your worst enemies and are feared throughout the battlefield. Snipers usually are well camouflaged so make sure you maintain low profile and keep stealth as well as watching and listening everything around you.

, Most of the work is done by yourself but having a good gun doesn't hurt.

, If you will run overconfident in yourself then you will be the first one to be out of the game! Make sure you get steady approach.

, It is always better to stay in one place just a bit longer to plan where are you going to move and what you are going to do rather than just running around spraying and praying for a lucky hit. If you're a sniper than think before you shoot as well! Shooting might get you spotted easily and you want to avoid it!

",How to Train As an Airsoft Sniper1," The target should initially be at a medium range in the open, as you improve move the target further away, add obstructions and make the target smaller.;
, Mark down the number you hit versus the number you didn't. On consecutive runs do the same, hopefully your hit number should go up. See if there are any patterns to the hits. Are they all at the beginning? If so, then you are probably losing concentration near the end. If they are all at the end then you are rushing into it, so slow down.

",How to Train As an Airsoft Sniper2,",,,,,,,,"
"
Find a place to train, preferably a barn, an airsoft field, or a forest with some wide open areas will do fine.,
Gather your team, 3-5 guys is the easiest to handle.,
Get some airsoft guns.,
Designate team roles.,
Begin training.",How to Train an Airsoft Team,";
, Make sure that all the people who are not serious about this are dealt with and that you make your point.

, Here are some ideas:


The CA Sportline M4 is one of the best guns a beginner on a budget can buy.
After some practice with cheap guns, try other airsoft electric guns, and make sure that you get one with a metal gear box, or if you have more money, a Systema. Echo 1 makes budget good guns for riflemen and sub machine gunners who only have about $150.

, This means choosing who will become the team's sniper, a machine gunner, a squad leader and a rifleman. Most Airsoft teams have too many people who want to be a sniper, but it is best to have 1 sniper and 1 spotter with him. If multiple people want to be sniper, set up moving targets or a player with armor and see who can shoot moving targets from farther away the best.

, Set up some barracks with boards and make barricades out of net or rope if you want. Then put your teammates against each other, and have another veteran to test and evaluate their skills.


For drills you can play capture the flag while a stationary sniper shoots at them in addition to them having their own weapons.
Another good drill is to have them behind a barrack with an empty magazine and some ammo and see how well they can reload with someone shooting at them.
A third good training drill is to set people against each other (even teams preferred) and give them one magazine with no extra ammo. This forces them to realize that they have to conserve ammo.
A fourth good training drill is to split your team in 2 have the good team and the enemies, but leave one person out. Then have the one man hide with no help from either team. Then the 2 different teams the good team and the op4 go separate ways to separate bases. The op4 is trying to capture the one man (who is playing as a crashed pilot) the good team is trying to save the pilot. Give everyone a gun except the pilot. Then whoever finds the pilot and takes him/her back to their base first wins.
Another useful drill is quite interesting one. Split up your team members into 2 teams. One is equipped with Airsoft guns each and other team isn't. The objective is to the team that hasn't got guns to communicate and remain stealthy while trying to capture the enemy flag. The team who has guns are not allowed to stay in one place all the time (particularly base) but have to patrol the area. They are allowed to shoot on sight.
Training isn't completely physical either, though you should get into good physical shape to play airsoft, you also must think about moves you make. A wise man thinks before he acts, a fool does not. A good mental training drill is the Hit and Run drill. You send one troop at a time inside enemy infested woods, they will have to think in order to get to their objective or checkpoint. The enemies will do a hit and run tactic, where they find the one soldier, they take one shot at him, and then they run to the next area where they will take another shot at the lone soldier. They keep doing this until the soldier gets hit or the soldier makes it to his objective. Do this at night and people will start freaking out because it is too much for the common brain to handle at once, having so many enemies around you firing and not knowing where they are at is torturous but fun. You must think in order to get past this drill, it's not easy I'll tell you that much.

"
"
Make two or three groups of 2 to 4.,
Identify the location of the sniper.

,
Send two groups to each side of the sniper and the optional third group up the center of the sniper's line of sight as a distraction.Keep in mind that there maybe other sniper teams out there and/or a spotter with the sniper you are advancing.,
Maneuver the two groups on the sides using stealth to bring the sniper into their range of fire.

,
Charge forward and attack when you have the sniper in range, from the right followed by the left (the direction does not matter).,
Be careful most snipers have spotters to locate targets and for extra fire power.,
Do not assume the sniper is helpless, they have side arms and know how to use them.Sometimes they might even have a mine or claymore.,
Be patient if you have been hit by a sniper, most good snipers know to not move until the target turns their back, don't turn your back keep shooting if it takes all day.,Look for high points or secluded areas some times even trash or rubbish piles these are sniper posts look for them before the game so you will know the places to avoid or unless you take out snipers then approach them from behind with another player or a sniper of your own.As said from some of the world's most famous snipers"" The best way to take out a sniper is with another sniper""- US marine Scout Snipers

,
Most snipers wear ghillie suits.,
Be informed: snipers know to stay on the move to avoid being caught, or at least most of the good ones do, so listen for snapping twigs and if you feel a sting you've been hit.

,
Use your skills.",How to Take out an Airsoft Sniper," Because most likely some of you will be shot, but keep in mind that the reason for this is because the sniper is hidden an it will be a great challenge just to spot him if he is well trained. people.;
,, And normally the spotter will carry a AEG(at least they should, no point on having two bolt action rifles in one location; you might as well be single snipers.)

,, Don't fire until you are caught or you have the target in range.

, Stay low to not be spotted by the snipers scope.

,(I have played with snipers that have a mine,and trust me my team and I looked on the ground countless times.)

, Unless you are hit the you need to go back and re-spawn depending on your field rules, but try not to turn all the way around.)

,, Most are store bought, however some make their own so look for places that seem suspicious and don't really blend in. Ghillie suits are hard to move around in so if you have them on the move you probably can catch up with them, especially if they are a slow runner to begin with.But keep in mind that if your up against a veteran sniper that knows where to hind when in a ghillie suit they it will be hard to spot him/her; because a ghillie is designed to take away the human outline.

,, All of you hunters out there apply your hunting knowledge to hunt down and take out that sniper.BECAUSE SNIPERS ARE A THREAT IN BATTLE!!!

",How to Take a Man Down in an Airsoft Fight,";
, If you don't, the person you are shooting at can get away, duck for cover (making it harder to shoot him), shoot back at you and hit you, or get some friends on his team to find you and shoot you.

,, If you don't, they can get shot, and that's one less guy on your team.

,,,, If you are playing in the woods, watch your step. Stepping on a twig or rustling leaves can alert nearby enemies.

, This will help with not being seen.

, It sure is fun.

"
Put out a call for people to join your team.,
Audition the potential soldiers/ team members.,
Choose a team name that everyone agrees on.

,
Call up your team.,
Write down your team's mission statement in one clear and precise sentence, i.e.",How to Start an Airsoft Team1," Do this among your friends, through social media and perhaps through any airsoft club or game affiliations that you have.


Ask friends to bring along their friends too. Or, siblings maybe.;
, Aim to have at least two members and up to six to form your team. These players should be willing to abide by your rules (but don't be bossy).

,, Gather the following information:


Your own name. This should be obvious. You need to identify the person whose information is on that sheet of paper.
Experience. This comes in handy when you begin to form your squads. You don't want a newcomer commanding six experienced soldiers.
Armory. This is helpful in deciding where and with whom to place the person.

, ""To develop discipline and honor through the sport of Airsoft.""

"
"
Become proficient.,
Do your research.,
Decide what squads you want to form and what roles you want filled.,
Discuss what you want to do with your team members.

,
Use a ranking system.,
Get good gear.",How to Start an Airsoft Team2," All team leaders must be proficient in weaponry. This includes marksmanship, tactical knowledge, and physical fitness. Make sure every member can perform various tasks.

, Learn formations, hand gestures i.e. stop, go, covering fire. (not the middle finger, please), and various military tactics. Just to help you in case you don't know what to research, try to learn hand sign such as ""Rally Up"" Hand Sign in which you get your right hand up, stick up your index finger and rotate it clockwise).

,


Examples of roles: rifleman, support gunner, heavy weapons, sniper, spotter, designated marksman, grenadier
Squads should be composed of snipers, support, assault and squad leaders. Depending on the size of the team, the team leader may or may not function as a squad leader. When a squad has four or more members, smaller fire teams can be formed. The point of doing this is to be able to quickly use tactics. If a leader of a fire team, squad, or platoon needs his unit to use a tactic like flanking or leapfrogging, it is much easier. He can simply tell Team A to do X while Team B does Y. This eliminates the need to designate specific people each time tactics are used, which would take up valuable time.

,, For example, private 1, private 2, captain, sergeant, etc.


Create your own, or copy the USA Army ranks and switch out some and/or add your own.






Other roles could include: Support Rifle Men, Medic, Gunner, Assault Squad A,B,C.. etc.







, Each members should have s tactical vest, and a PolarStar brand/HPA tapped airsoft gun with high caps (metal). And get some good upgrades.


Have radios for your team to practice communications/ in dark times and during daytime.







"
"
Have code names for all types of things.,
Develop hand signals that work just for your team members.,
Be loyal to your teammates.",How to Start an Airsoft Team3," This can be confusing at first, but if you yell ""I need help at Alpha"", they won't know where your talking about. Good code names include:

, Hand signals are a way of communicating if a radio goes down or you on a covet mission with out making a sound. Things like putting your left arm out will mean go left, putting a flat hand above your head will mean hostiles,and so on.

, They will be loyal to you if you are to them.

"
Pump your team up to make them play harder.,
Choose or build a base (preferably big but it can be small too, you make want to add windows/gun slits) The base should be near your home so you can keep an eye on it and it should be easy to get to.

,
Locate a field.,
Research the best weapons and the opponent's weapons.,
Practice.,
Go on missions.",How to Start an Airsoft Team4," Start each member as a private (or affiliated rank (depending on country)) and make them want to achieve a promotion. This can be done by giving them more responsibilities and allow them to command lower ranks.

,, A field is used to play. If you don't have a field in your area, make one. To learn how to make one, there is plenty of useful information online to get your own field started.

, Also research the playing fields and all the hiding spots.

, Meet once a week and practice strategies, code names, and code words.


Regular training sessions will help to get team members pumped up for regular airsoft game days, tournaments, etc.







, That's the whole point! Have fun with them.


Go against some other bigger teams (or your size), just for fun. This will keep your teammates happy and they'll be even more loyal!

Pick out a backpack that is able to store a lot of Airsoft equipment in.,
Now you need to buy a large supply of ammo (preferably 5,000 count containers).,
Depending on what type of gun you have but either way if it's over 350 FPS then consider buying lots of .2 Gram BB's.

,
Now you need to Buy a sidearm (preferably a handgun) for Airsoft, you will also need to buy a primary weapon (Sniper/AEG/C02 Arms/Shotgun).

,
Place the sidearm in the main compartment of the backpack along with your ammo and primary.

,
You will also need to Buy some binoculars and place them in any compartment away from everything else so they do not get scratched.

,
You will need a little pouch or compartment to store multi-tools and screw drivers in.,
Also carry a medical kit just in case you fall or run into a thorn bush.

,
Store extra camo or extra clothes so if you are getting to hot you can change real quick into something light on the battlefield.,
Also store extra accessories for your gun if you have to modify it on the field.

,
Have an extra pare of goggles or glasses just in case your other ones break.

,
Always keep lube NEVER USE WD-40 on your airsoft gun in less than a week it will eat through the plastic in your gun making it useless.,
Bring Water!",How to Set up an Airsoft Backpack," Usually duffle bags are the most popular because they are able to hold AEG's and other Rifles.;
, Place all the ammo into the large compartment of the backpack.

,,,,, You will always need tools just in case something happens to your gun and you need to fix it.

,, Change behind cover or in a bunker while nobody is around.

,,, ALWAYS use silicone spray to keep your gun in tip top shape.

, You will eventually get thirsty especially when playing airsoft.

Survey the area.,
Get People.,
Split them.,
Maintain Distance.,
Hide.,
Have a good strategy.,
Manage your ammo.,
Get good weapons.,
Reload sensibly.,
Tell your team to cover somebody or make a partner that you have to cover them unless you get hit.

,
Don't go in the open to shoot the enemy.You have to take your steps slow and steady.

,
If you are trying to shoot a person in a bunker, hide behind a tree and shoot in the hole part or get a airsoft grenade and throw it in the hole where the person is shooting.

,
If you have an airsoft sniper, snipe an enemy wide open because it will be not as hard to shoot them.

,
Listen to your team.",How to Survive an Airsoft War," If possible, before the game starts have a good look around. Learn where all the hiding spots are, where all the rooms are and where your team will be fighting. Having a good knowledge of the map and all it's facilities will put you well ahead of all your teammates and enemies. Also, if you know that one of your teammates are going into a dangerous area you can save their life. You will probably find good places that your enemies will be hiding in, therefore you can easily check those places first when clearing a room.;
, It would be good if you have a large number like, 20 people.

, Split them into 4 members in each group, thus making 5 groups.

, Only,if you do this,would you be able to play efficiently.

, If you are in an open space full of trees, then hide behind them.If you in a place with pillars, then you have to hide there to escape from being attacked.

, You have to discuss your plan properly with your team mates.

, Even in the real army, you will eventually run out of ammo. You'll never be able to have an endless supply on you so manage the small amount of ammo that you do have. It's not hard to manage your ammo, just don't waste it. Save it by aiming and hitting your target, not shooting to scare your enemy and not spraying randomly, also known as blind fire. If you use all of your ammo, your friends might not have any spares, leaving you as a fist magnet for bullets. You also want to preserve your grenades too, you never know when you might really need them.

, While machine guns are good, they tend to use much more ammo than guns that shoot in short bursts of three or four bullets. Sometimes they can be heavier too. When you're running around and shooting, the last thing you want is a heavy gun. Try to find a relatively light one that doesn't use too much ammo. Along with a good primary weapon, you also want a good secondary weapon. A small, lightweight pistol is recommended. The pistol doesn't use much ammo and can be great in emergencies.

, Running around and spraying your gun will almost definitely make it run out of ammo. Running around and reloading will almost definitely get you killed. To avoid being shot while reloading, reload when in cover or when there are no enemies about. If you're in a group, shout ""reloading!"" to your team so they know to cover you for a minute. Even in a group, still get to cover as enemies tend to aim for the ones that can't return fire. Return the favor when you're teammates are reloading too, they'll love you.

,,,,, If your team leader or teammates are telling you it's unsafe, don't go. Even if you know where the enemies are, still don't go. Also listen out to hear what you team are doing. They should tell you when they're reloading, returning fire and throwing a grenade. If they're reloading, shoot anyone trying to shoot them. If they're returning fire, return fire with them. If they're throwing a grenade, keep an eye out for where it's going to land. If it's near you, run. If it's not, get to cover to absorb the explosion.

"
"
Practice aiming.,
Use different guns.,
Try shooting from behind cover quickly and accurately.,
Try snap shooting.,
Judge distance and power for grenades by throwing a rock that is about the same shape and weight to different distances or from different distances.,
Finally, practice with friends, moving targets work better because you adapt to shooting a realistically moving target and can get practice for dodging as well, which may come in handy.",How to Train for Airsoft," Set up a stable target and stand ten feet away. Each time you hit it, move five feet back, and each time you miss, move five feet forward. Once you start going from one place to another again and again, you have found your comfortable shooting range. After finding your range, draw a mark where you can hit it and one where you can't. Try to get past these marks and still be able to hit the target consistently. Also try in different conditions maybe like shade or during a windy day, from a hill shooting down or from the bottom upward, with the sun in your eyes, anything you might face in a real battle.;
, The chances are, you are NOT going to use one gun the entire time. Just because you can hit a target with you main weapon doesn't mean you are a James Bond with your back-up. When it comes down to the battle, you may be cornered and out of ammo for your main, and then miss with your sub and get shot.

, You very well may use this skill in a battle. As with normal target practice, try in different conditions because cover may be in the middle of nowhere, close to the enemy, or very far away from the enemy.

, If you are cornered then you want to be able to pull out a sub weapon and shoot quickly or the enemy will realize and shoot you first. The concept is like a cowboy draw, wait until the right moment and pull,shoot! This could come in handy.

, If you can master this and throw a grenade right under a target, then in a real battle, the enemy would be screwed badly. Just imagine having a grenade go off between your legs before you can realize what is happening.

, Do not use the grenade practice though, you don't want to hurt your friends that badly, do you?

Get into the right mindset.,
Be realistic about the consequences.,
Don't give up.,
Be bold.",How to Feel Confident and Not Afraid of Passing a Defender in Soccer1," This is the most important point. Just think to yourself ""I am going to beat this defender,"" and it will come. You can beat them. Have faith in yourself, and never think for one second that you are going to fail.


Remember that no two defenders are the same, and no two situations are the same. You may have messed up once, but that doesn't mean that you'll mess up again.
Focus all of your energy and attention on the moment at hand. You will play more effectively and more smoothly if you aren't up in your head. Be present.;
, If you fail to pass the defender, it won't be the end of the world. It will just be one mistake, and nothing permanent. You can always bounce back. You can hustle back down the field, give 110%, and redeem yourself by recovering the ball. Your teammates won't hate you for trying to win the game – more likely, they'll support your spirit.


If you are getting a lot of negative feedback for your mistakes, consider talking to someone about it. No one should be heckling you for trying your best. Talk to a coach, a parent, or a team captain, and ask them to help you put a stop to it., Try and try again, even if you keep losing the ball. The more you keep trying, the more likely it is that you will succeed. With enough persistence and dedication, you can accomplish almost anything.


You don't need to try again right away. If the game is tight, don't keep throwing yourself at a tough defender. Be humble, and pass the ball away., You may not be certain that you can pass this defender, but you will regret it if you don't try. Life is dangerous, and fear is natural – but human beings define themselves by how they act in the face of fear. Even if you are never the star player on your team, you can be the sort of player who gives as much as he/she can in every single play."
"
Be aware of your teammates' positions.,
Go for it.,
Knock the ball past the player and run after it.,
Fake the defender out.",How to Feel Confident and Not Afraid of Passing a Defender in Soccer2," Before deciding whether you are going to beat the defender, you should look up and make yourself aware of your teammates positions on the field. Listen for any calls from them – check whether it makes more sense to pass the ball off to someone. If possible, try to play the ball to a teammate who has more space to run.


If one of your teammates is making a clever run, you could use their run as a decoy. If a defender is marking you, he may try to get back and cover the runner. This would give you more space and time to run at the defense, leaving them on the back foot and giving you time to think about what to do next.
Alternately, a different defender may pull across to cover the run. This would create space in behind the defense, unless the fullback comes across as well. In this case, a long pass across the field would be appropriate. If neither defender tracks the run, try to play the killer ball behind the back line.

, If no teammate is in a better position than you and no teammate is trying to run in behind, this is usually the green light for you to beat the defender. Be confident, quick, and decisive. Go and beat him!

, Most of the time, you don't need to do anything complicated to beat some defenders. With a quick turn of pace and good balance, all you have to do is knock the ball inside or outside of the player and sprint after it. Using feints (pretending to go one way and then going the other way) can help a lot with this.

, Make the defender think that you're going one way with the ball, then move off in a different direction. Run towards the defender, dribbling the ball. When you are again 2-3 feet away from the defender's leg-reach, shift your body language to the right or the left of the opposing player. Look in that direction, and give the opposing player every indication that you plan to charge in that direction.


Drop your shoulder toward the side you want the defender to think you are charging, and keep your upper torso facing the same direction – around 25 degrees off-kilter from facing straight at the defender.
Quickly tap the ball with the outside of your foot. if you want to fake going to the left of the defender, use your right foot; if faking right, use your left foot. Roll the ball very slightly toward the side you don't plan to take – then immediately tap the ball back on course.
Charge past the defender and toward the goal.

"
"
Practice.,
Work on your ball control.,
Learn tricks.,
Practice until you feel confident.",How to Feel Confident and Not Afraid of Passing a Defender in Soccer3," Practice all the moves that you know, and try to do them fluently. Start very slowly, on your own, and run through your tricks at a speed that would never fly in a game situation. Focus on technique rather than speed. The more comfortable you feel, the faster you'll get.


If you do not feel completely confident in your ability to beat a player, there are training drills online. Match-play skill move tutorials can be very helpful. Watch these, work with them, and put effort into your training sessions to acquire the skills to beat a defender., The better you can handle the ball, the more confident you'll be in your ability to outplay a defender. Juggle the ball and work on your foot-eye coordination. Dribble through the tight spaces of your house to develop good ball control.


Try setting up a line of cones (about 5-10 feet apart) and running drills. Weave through the cones, dribbling the ball, and be careful not knock any of them over.Pass the ball to yourself. Kick it off of a brick wall or pitch-back, and practice meeting the ball when it returns to you. This will hone your foot-eye coordination.

, You don't need to know how to perform fancy tricks, but they may allow you to beat a player with more ease than before. Knowing a lot of tricks can help you tackle tough situations and feel more confident on the field – which will create room for more effective striking.

, The more you practice a move, the more sure of your ability you will be. Practice with friends, with family, and by yourself. Work on your skills during team practices, and ask coaches or other players for advice on how to better execute these moves.As you get stronger and stronger, the time will come to show your skills in a game situation. You don't need to plan too much – just be mentally prepared.
If you can do it in practice, you can do it in games. If you've done this over and over in practice situations, then you've already succeeded. Be confident."

Explode.",How to Dribble Like Lionel Messi," Messi and other great dribblers keep the ball extremely close to their body as they move, almost as if it were glued to a short rope around the ankle. To build your close-dribbling skills, practice snaking through cones as quickly as possible. You'll force yourself to control the ball and keep it close to make it around the cones without going all wonky.









It's important to practice as a quick clip. It's easy to keep the ball close while you walk around, but it's much harder to do at a full sprint. Gradually build up your speed and your dribbling stamina, aiming for a touch on the ball every 2-3 strides.;
, Good vision is essential to good ball control and excellent Messi-style dribbling. Practice keeping your eyes looking up at the action around you, focusing on defenders hips to see which direction they're moving so you can anticipate the best way to get them off balance or even catch them with their legs spread for a morale-killing nutmeg.

, It's almost unfair: Messi is a great dribbler in part because he's short. Not that height makes you a better dribbler, but he takes more strides per dribble than some other dribblers, and he's forced to keep the ball close, taking short little quick steps as he moves. Taller players can do the same thing, but it'll take more practice and helps to center yourself low, squatting and staying on top of the ball.








, Remember how Jack Sparrow walked in Pirates of the Caribbean, arms out to steady the drunkenness? Watch some tape--great dribblers like Messi dribble like that. Keeping your arms bent and slightly out from your body allows you to maintain your balance during quick transitions and changes of direction, keeping yourself in the best position.








, Speed is one of the major keys to Lionel Messi's style of play and his ball control. Being able to keep the ball close at fast speeds is what distinguishes Messi from average players.









To work on your speed, do wind sprints with a ball. Try to go as fast as you can with as many touches on the ball as possible. Time yourself and work on getting your time faster from one end of the field to another.
Run lines, or suicides. To build your fast-twitch explosiveness, start running suicide drills that'll have you moving back and forth across the field, from the goal line to the 6 yard (5.5 m) box, the 18 yard (16.5 m) box, mid-field, and back.

, In an interview, Messi was once asked what it took to become a great player like him and he said that they key was to love the game and play it constantly. From the age of 3 on, Messi played every day, morning, afternoon, and night. He played inside and got in trouble for breaking things. As soon as he could walk, he was dribbling a soccer ball. Do the same.

, Put your body between passes that you receive and any defenders around you. Turn your hip or you back to the defense and try as much as you can to shield the ball from them. Messi will often already have his eyes up and looking over his shoulder at an opponent as soon as he traps the ball., When you trap a pass, try to do it by controlling it with the foot farthest away from the opponent. Though Messi often gets close enough to touch the defense, he's always got the ball closer to him and his center of gravity than his opponents. To start off on the right foot (ha!), accept the pass and trap it to create space in which to work.








, Keeping your eyes up, decide which direction is more likely to allow you enough space to maneuver around the defender. His hips won't lie: Look closely at the defender's hips to see which direction they're turned and what he seems to be anticipating you'll do.


If you're right-footed, most defenders will instinctively guess that you'll go right, which might be your natural tendency anyway. Use that misconception to your advantage.

, Control the ball with the foot that matches the direction you're eventually going to go and take a step with the other foot. Messi's signature move happens so quick it's easy to miss, which is why it's so effective against defenders. Basically, to juke out a defender, Messi takes one stutter-step in the fake direction, feints, and then dribbles in the opposite with the outside of his foot.







, Messi brings the defender in and forces him to reveal his hand and make a mistake before blowing past them finding space. Messi isn't a flashy dribbler like Ronaldhino or a master of the step-over like Cristiano Ronaldo, he just uses simple changes of direction and ball control to do inhuman looking things.








, Drop it into high gear when you decide to switch direction. Blow past your opponent by flicking the ball in the direction you want to go and moving into your quick-dribble that you've been practicing so aggressively.









You don't have to go super-fast to find space, you just need to make the smart dribble and catch the defender flat-footed and out of position. He won't be able to touch you.

To improve on your speed, do some sprinting every day. More importantly, do stretches before a game or a run. You need stamina, so go for a jog around a field.;
,, Before you get into flicks feints and step overs, train until you can dribble very fast between cones, keeping the ball under tight control and close to you all the time. Perfect the basics before you try to play like Ronaldo.

, This is done by swinging your foot around the ball and doing a body feint in the same time to send the defenders the wrong way.

, This is done by jumping with one foot and in the same time using the inside of your other foot to go the other way. I prefer jumping with my left foot and using the inside of my right foot to go the other way.

, Use your speed and tricks to beat the full-back and whip the ball into the box!

, When you dribble, don't hit the ball 5 meters away from you because you will get tackled and teammates might even think it's a pass. Keep the ball close to you, like if it was glued to your feet! Dribbling around the house will help the moves become second nature.

, If you're too close, the defender can easily swipe the ball away from you. Try to get the ball between the legs of the defender.

, If you're too far away, the defender will not get off-balanced and can still approach you.

, Do them approximately 3 feet away from a defender.

Know a few important points before beginning.,
Know what parts can be upgraded in your AEG.",How to Upgrade an Airsoft AEG1," Making sure you don't fall for some common mistakes or myths can help you make the most of your upgrade options:

Note that FPS does NOT necessitate range and or measure how good a gun is. A high quality gun with 245 fps with 0.25g or 0.28g bbs can easily out range guns with 450+ fps. FPS is only one of many factors in range. Your hopup/bucking has a much greater affect on range and accuracy than your FPS.
Barrel length does not equal accuracy or range. Some CQB guns with 200mm barrels can out range DMRs and snipers with 500mm+ inner barrels. Also barrels too long can hinder performance. It's all about the quality of the barrel. See the Barrel upgrade section for more.
Airsoft BBs, if high quality, can drastically improve an Airsoft weapons performance. Popular brands include Elite Force, Madbull, Goldenball, and G&G among others. It is best to use .25-.30g weight BBs, but as long as they are .20g seamless or heavier you'll be fine.;
, In a normal AEG many parts can be changed or upgraded. Here is a list of them and what they do. Be aware of which type of gearbox you have as parts for a ver. 1 gearbox will not fit in ver. 2-3-4-5-6-7 gearboxes. However, some parts are rather universal and can be used in a plethora of gearboxes.



Hop Up Bucking is the part that puts backspin on the BB. Marui guns come with decent ones but other companies make better ones. G&G green, Lonex 70 degree, Prometheus purple, Maple Leaf and Firefly are some of the best. Firefly makes a special one with 2 nubs in the top to create a better, more centered spin due to having two contact points on the BB instead of one. However, there are many diy mods that will yield better range and accuracy, with the most notable ones being the flat hop, s-hop, and r-hop.







Hop Up Chamber. The Hop Up Chamber can be changed for more consistency. The stock plastic ones in Tokyo Marui guns are known for their quality and consistent accuracy, but there are also upgrade units made by Systema, Lonex, SHS, King Arms, Prometheus, ProWin and Madbull, as well as many other upgrade companies. If you have an AR-type AEG, you may consider changing to a rotary style hopup, like the one used in Krytac AEGs, as rotary hop ups are also easier to adjust.







Barrel. Some people change to barrels longer or tighter than their stock ones. It is a common misconception that the tighter the barrel, the better. ""This is false"". A tight bore can help with air efficiency and voluming, but not really accuracy. The inner finish and straightness will contribute to your accuracy. However, it's best to not get one too tight or it may jam more frequently. Most AEGs come stock with 6.08mm or 6.06mm diameter barrels. Your best bet for a barrel is one made of stainless steel, in a multitude of tests they perform better than aluminum based upgrade barrels. Decent economic barrels include SHS, ZCI, Madbull, and Lonex. The best barrels include EdGI (which is indisputably  the best), PDI, and Prometheus. NEVER buy an aluminum barrel, as they are generally less accurate than brass or steel barrels. NEVER use low quality BBs, and only clean with very soft materials. NOT paper towels. Use micro fiber cloths and rubbing alcohol to avoid scraping. 1Bullet3.jpg|center|550px]]

Spring. The stronger your spring, the higher the velocity the piston can be forced forward at. Don't fit a high powered spring with standard internals as you are likely to strip the gears and/or damage the piston. Guarder and PDI springs are best. Systema can crack easily but Prometheus is also good, although their ""unique"" coloring wears off after a while, damaging your gears. Most springs besides PDI are rated in metres per second, so a M100 spring is 100 metres per second or 328 feet per second.







Spring Guide. This stops the spring from jumping into the gear case. Many AEGs come with plastic guides as standard but Guarder, Systema, and Prometheus make steel ones. If it has spacers it will increase your muzzle velocity; you can also get ones with ball bearings at the base which will prevent twisting in the spring under compression, resulting in better FPS consistency shot to shot.







Cylinder. The cylinder is the area in which the air is compressed before being forced down the barrel. Most cylinders are ported to prevent over-voluming, which will let your rof, cause excessive wear, increase how loud your aeg is, and possibly affect your accuracy. The only reason to upgrade the cylinder is if you install a longer barrel, as it will require more air volume to push the BB out the barrel. Matching cylinder volume to the barrel volume is the the best way to get the most from your setup.







Cylinder Head. It is common to upgrade the cylinder head to one that has two o-rings to improve compression. Lonex, ZCI, and SHS all make good ones, but most upgrade companies make a decent one.







Air Nozzle. The air nozzle is the part that pushes the bb into the Hop Up Chamber. It is also needed to seal the airflow from the cylinder head to the BB, so some have internal 'O' rings like Guarder.







Piston. The piston compresses the air in the cylinder. It is essentially a flat-toothed gear. It is wound back by the gears from the motor and then forced forward at high speed by the spring, compressing the air in front of it. It therefore is subject to tremendous pressure. Metal pistons are good for Semi-Auto AEGs but if fired in Full Auto they may strip the gears. G&P, Guarder,and Deep Fire make good ones. Prometheus is OK with some mods. The Super Core Piston made by System (not to be confused with Systema) is probably the best of all, but is hard to find outside Japan.







Piston Head. The piston head seals the air into the cylinder. You can get good and bad ones. Classic Army and most clones generally have great piston heads. You can also get silent ones to quieten down your gun and bearing ones to increase the muzzle velocity. G&P, Systema, Guarder, and Prometheus make good ones.







Gears. The gears are a very important and expensive part of the rifle. Don't be tempted to buy cheap gears, as you will probably end up paying a lot more to fix the gearbox when they break. If you are upgrading to high powered springs or hi-speed/torque motors opt for steel gears. If you want high ROF you can buy high speed gears from Prometheus, Systema and Guarder. Systema, Guarder and Prometheus make high torque as well. Most of these are helical which means the teeth are at an angle. If you use these you need a half toothed piston. They are also harder to shim correctly. You have 3 gears, the bevel attached to the motor pinion, spur in the middle and sector gear attached to the piston.







Bushings and Bearings. The bushes keep the gears in places and are what the gears rotate on. If they break the gears will probably strip. The bigger the bushing the better. Most guns ship with plastic 6mm bushes fitted. If you upgrade go for metal bushes and if you are looking for higher ROF or torque, get a new gearbox casing that will take 7mm or 8mm bushes. Bearings on the other hand, have small metal balls inside of them that increases ROF even more. 6mm and 7mm bearings can't handle strong springs, while 8mm and 9mm can since of their greater size.







Shims. The shims are used to keep the gears aligned and correctly meshing. Incorrect shimming will lead to increased gear wear or failure.







Tappet plate. The tappet plate pulls the air nozzle back to let the BB in. If it snaps your gun will not feed. TM stock and ANGEL are the best. A Chinese brand called World-Element also makes decent ones for a good price.







Selector Plate. This part rarely breaks. It can be upgraded for more electrical stability.







Anti-Reversal Latch. This latch stops the gears from spinning backwards and damaging the gun. Systema and Prometheus make aftermarket versions.







Cut Off Lever. This stops the gears so you can fire Semi-Auto. If it does break or wear you will only have Automatic fire.







Trigger mechanism. If you fire too much on Full Auto the mechanism can burn out and your gun will cease to fire. Systema and Guarder make aftermarket versions. Keep the contacts clean to avoid short-circuits.







Sector Chip. Guns don't come stock with these but they essentially keep the tappet plate back longer so the BBs feed better. They have no negative side effects and will not break easily.







Motor. You can opt for hi-speed or torque. Don't put a hugely powerful motor in a standard gun and hope it will work. You will strip the gears or piston. The Systema Magnum and Turbo are excellent. Lonex also makes terrific motors that can run a bit pricey...but are well worth it







Battery. The higher the voltage, the higher your ROF will be. The higher the Milliampere-Hour rating (mAH), the more BBs you can fire per charge (as a rule of thumb for a fairly standard gun, 1 mAH = 1 shot). Intellect, G&P, Sanyo, Valken and Elite are great. Most guns come with poor batteries included, it's often best to test if you brand new gun will fire....and throw them away. Also, do not go for the highest power battery you can find straight away, as the voltage may be too high for your current setup and may damage components. Search the net and airsoft forums for advice on battery selection. 12volt= INSANE performance. Many guns even upgraded cannot handle these batteries.







THE STOCK. Most stocks can be changed for tactical ones

Load the BBs into the loading chamber.,
Place the magazine into the airsoft gun and fire!

,
Reloading the magazine.,
Refill Magazine.",How to Use a High Capacity Airsoft Magazine," This can be done by opening the trap door usually found at the top of the magazine. Then pour high quality BBs into the magazine. Make sure to pour only enough. Do not over pour, as this could jam the magazine. Then shut the trap door tight.;
, To do this, wind the wheel found at the bottom of the magazine and listen until you hear a different noise than before. This noise indicates how many more times to wind the magazine. Wind the wheel 3 more times to put pressure on the BBs so they will actually go up into the airsoft gun instead of sinking back into the magazine from gravity.

,, Once no more BBs are coming out of the barrel, and the airsoft gun is still firing (AKA dry-firing), repeat the previous two steps.

, Repeat the first step.

The following can be upgraded on a bolt action rifle.",How to Upgrade an Airsoft AEG2,"



Barrel. The tighter the barrel the better your accuracy and consistency will be. PDI, Laylax and Dees Custom make them. Marui also makes a precision barrel and chamber set which is quite good.







Hop Up Rubber. The Hop Up Rubber gives the BB back-spin increasing the range and accuracy. Nine Ball and FireFly make good ones.







Piston. The piston compresses the air in the cylinder. Some have air brakes which silence the gun but this reduces the power. The lighter and stronger your piston the better.







Spring. The stronger the spring, the faster the piston is forced forward, and the higher the muzzle velocity. Get a good quality one. Laylax make great ones.







Hop Up Chamber. Most clone and Chinese guns come with poor chambers. Getting a good one will greatly improve accuracy. The Marui precision one for the VSR-10 is excellent.







Piston head. The piston head forces the air into the barrel, propelling your BB. For the VSR-10, PDI and Laylax make good ones.







Spring Guide. This stops the spring from jumping about. Most guns come with plastic ones. Get a metal one and it will last longer.







Cylinder. If you get a teflon or polished cylinder you will have an easier bolt pull. Teflon on your cylinder means you don't need to lube it.







Bolt Handle. If you have a big bolt handle it will be easier to cock your gun. Guarder makes them for the L96 and APS2. PSS10 makes them for the VSR-10.







Trigger sear. Don't be tempted to get a cheap trigger sear. If you fit a very strong spring change your trigger seat. It keeps the gun cocked. If it breaks your gun will not cock.







Piston sear. Catches the piston and is supported by the trigger sear. Has a lot less strain put on it than the trigger sear.







Spring Guide Stopper. Keeps the cylinder in place. You should also upgrade this when increasing the muzzle velocity.







Trigger mechanism. The best triggers are zero trigger. They require only a light trigger pull and are very strong. Comes with a spring guide stopper, piston sear and trigger sear.

Find a team.,
Learn how to aim with a Barricade.,
Battle on the front lines.,
Decide which type of dart to use.,
Keep extra ammunition handy.,
Use the Barricade's disadvantages to your advantage.",How to Win a Nerf War With a Barricade," Try to make it so that your team has at least 2 people. If you have a team, your teammate(s) have more guns, so you won't have to completely rely on your Barricade, because your teammate(s) will also be shooting. Also, with a teammate, you can use your teammate's guns instead of your Barricade.;
, The Barricade shoots differently than other Nerf guns, and you will need to know how to aim it if you are going to use it in battle. Aim down the sights slightly higher than you want to shoot, increasing the height the farther you are from your target. Also, put the wind-speed into account. Because of the fact that Nerf darts are foam, the wind will easily blow them off-target. If the wind is blowing from the right, aim the gun slightly to the left, and vice versa.


Also, put the recoil of the Barricade into account. The Barricade is a semi-automatic weapon, and it will have recoil when you shoot it one shot after the other. One way to reduce the recoil would be to hold your breath when you are shooting it. Another way is to hold it with two hands when you are shooting it. Another way to reduce the recoil is to shoot slowly. When you shoot one shot after the other, there will be a whole lot of recoil. If you shoot slowly, there won't be as much. Do all three of those things to reduce the recoil, and you will be aiming like a professional.

, A Barricade was designed to be used while running, because of it's ability to be shot quickly and being lightweight. The Barricade is also very loud, and should not be used for stealth, although it can be modified. The Barricade is also quite small, so run around with it, and you are guaranteed success.

, If you want the darts to stick to walls, and your enemy, then use the suction darts. If you want the dart to make a sound when it is shot, and you want to get the attention of the enemy so that they stop attacking a teammate, then use the whistler darts. You can also use a mix of suction darts and whistler darts.

, Consider using a bandolier kit. The Barricade holds only 10 darts at one time, and they easily run out because of the fact that the gun is semi-automatic, and is usually shot with speed.

, The main disadvantage about the Barricade, is that it is unnecessarily loud. In order to turn the gun on, you have to deal with the loud humming/buzzing noise. A way to use this to your advantage, is to try to get the enemies' attention on you, and away from your teammates. While you fend off your enemies, your teammates can flank your enemies, and/or go to their base and steal ammo. Another disadvantage about the Barricade is that it isn't clip-fed, so you have to put darts inside one by one. There is a couple of clever ways to use this to your advantage. One way is that you can put one or two darts inside the gun, and then surrender to an enemy that is alone. The darts will not be seen by the enemy, and he will be caught off guard. When he comes to take the gun from you, shoot his chest twice, and he will die. Another way to use this to your advantage is to sit in one area, and to shoot enemies that come by. This is called camping. You will need many darts beside you, because after every shot, you will put one dart inside the gun. You will not run out of ammunition until all of your darts run out. You can't do this with a gun that is clip-fed, though, and that is what is unique about the Barricade.


When you sit there, you should put a shoulder-stock on the gun, so that you can shoot more accurately.

Don't over-complicate.,
However, this is not an effective way to run a team.

,
Don't simplify too much.,
Set up a small team with two main elements.",How to Run a Small Airsoft Team Efficiently," It is often their first instinct to start assigning roles like:

Sniper.



 


Spotter.






Recon.






Special ops.






Demolition.






Point man.






CQB specialist.






Support gunner.






Designated marksman.






Communications expert.






Etc.;
,, Having a team with no organization means that the team will not be following a coherent plan once fighting breaks out.

, That way, tactics such as leapfrogging, flanking, etc. can be used effectively. With only one group, the leader will have to designate certain players to do a certain thing each time he wants to employ a tactic. This would take up too much time during a firefight. With more than two teams, each unit will be too small to be effective. Only two groups are needed for most basic tactics.

The two elements should be approximately equal in terms of the players' skill and weapons. Each should have one leader. The two should ideally be equipped with radios. Out of the squad leaders, one is also the team leader.






Everyone on a four man team should be a rifleman. There is no need for more advanced roles.If you have six or more it could be necessary to have more advanced positions.






Instead of having one man do scout or recon work, the entire team should move. Recon elements are only necessary for large teams.






Support gunners are not necessary. When one squad is supposed to give suppressing fire, both team members should do this.






With so few players, any ""sniper"" should stay with the squad to act as a rifleman. Designated marksman are also not necessary with such a small team. Once a rifleman cannot make a shot, he can simply tell another who is capable to do so.

Get any attachments or extra parts for your weapons.",How to Upgrade Your Airsoft Arsenal," There are so many different types of guns out there that are competitive, so search the Internet and find something you like. All i can do is recommend some brands for you. KWA, G&G, VHC, Classic Army, and echo 1 are the best brands for AEG assault rifles and etc. guns. Sub-Machine guns are good with Echo-1 brands.The best snipers are UTG, TSD, and Airsoft GI customs. You will also likely want to purchase a side arm. A Pistol is a good idea, KWA/KWC is the best. People who play extended games might want another primary like an assault rifle with a Sub or a Sub with a shotgun or a LMG with an assault, etc.;
, You might want a helmet to complete your load-out. MICH replica's and PASGT's are the easiest to find. Those who play CQB will want a great Face mask, like the save phase. Balaclava's and recon wraps make good face protection for those who use helmets and hats. Most of you should already have a good pair of safety glasses/goggles. Headsets are a good idea so you can communicate with your team or just to complete the look.

, You will want a primary camo color scheme, like Multicam on multicam, or ACU on ACU/OD, or MARPAT on OD, etc. Once you've made a mindset you should purchase your camo BDU's. When it comes time to finish the vests, MOLLE Chest Rigs and Plate Carriers are a good idea. These vests allow you to select whatever pouches you'd like. The best plate carriers are OE-Tech, Pantac (if you have the money) Condor, and NC Star. Same for chest rigs. Typically you will want to purchase Mag pouches, A dump pouch, Pistol pouches, A pistol holster, Admin pouch, utility pouch, hydration carrier, and a Radio Pouch(if u have coms).

, You will want matching BDU pants as mentioned above. Leg gear comes little to none but you might want Drop Leg holsters or drop legs in general. Knee pads don't hurt and only cost around $20. Boots can be purchased anywhere but are more or less necessary.

, Typically this step will cost money. Attachments aren't cheap, it can be as much as $200 for a grenade launcher and $100 for red-dot sights. This depends on where you play however! If you play field getting a noob tube or scope wouldn't hurt. If you play CQB, noobtubes are good bursts, but heavy, so it will slow you down. CQB should have grips and low-profile sights.

, This could include natural features like a ditch or a hill, trees or walls, rocks or old junk parts of vehicles.

, Keep an eye open for and note down potential lookouts, trap locations, obstacles and observation points.

,, Bringing a ruler and a laser rangefinder can be very useful while surveying.

,, There may be signs of wild animal tracks, nests and prints, poisonous plants or vegetation with thorns that you may have to remove, or put boundaries.

, You may have old furniture like an entertainment center that is too small for your new flat screen filling space in your garage, leftover fence boards, fence posts or other materials staked in your yard or patio.

, Many people post on some sites like [[Give Stuff Away on Craigslist| Craigslist to give away a wide variety of items, materials, and tools that you can use for your build.

Hold an enemy hostage and write a note to the enemy saying you have a hostage.,
Use cover wisely.,
If your gun jams, do not drop it and run.,
If you have a mercenary, have him or her roam off on their own, this is better and the enemy may not think they aren't working for you.

,

Use your gun as a shield.,
Go on the offensive when you can.,
Try to pretend to be on the other guy's side and spy for your real side.,
If the rules say that you can have a medic who can revive other fighters, have the medic armed with a small pistol.

,
If the rules let you, make a Nerf shield.",How to Win a Nerf War," Don't pick somewhere that echoes or is closed in. Try out in the open field with lots of dirt mounds and trees to hide behind. Rural and outdoorsy areas are fantastic, as you want as many places to hide as possible. A large backyard with lots of obstacles will also work.;
, Give each team time to prepare battle plans before the war begins. Successful teams make plans together.

Get a good set of players. 10 on 10 is great, but as long as you have at least one person to fight, you'll have fun. A proper team includes 7-8 players.

, If somebody is less suited to running around, make him or her a sniper. Try to include everybody and give everybody a suitable role. If you have new people, just make them shadow your best fighters. Also, arrange the formation of the players that are playing with you.


Have snipers on either side of the field, a machine gun in the front and a machine gun in the back.

, Make some targets and practice shooting at least an hour a day. Get some extra ammo and get your team mates to shoot at you so you can practice hearing darts and dodging. Become a Nerf ninja! Practice cool moves like double duck somersault, cartwheels or back flips.you can also practice a blitzkrieg strategy or winning by intense rushing

, See the terrain, and if possible, set some traps for enemy; it's not cheating. If, however, you've been invited to a Nerf-Out, be sure to play by the rules set by the person in charge.

, Keep your best gun as the one you're holding, but carry a secondary weapon, and even a spare, if you have a shoulder or back strap for it. Remember, guns are not everything, if you are good at Nerf and have good skill you will win with any gun.


A good primary is the Nerf Stryfe with a Rampage clip in it. A good secondary would be the Strongarm. Try making a holster for a Retaliator or Hammershot . If you are not good at sniping, but are good on offense and strong, consider using a Havok Fire machine gun. they are not quiet, but they are quick and accurate, easily helping you to finish off anyone trying to do away with you.

, Have the leader in front, then the bombers and foot-soldiers. Make sure your newbies are staying in a safe position, and they know what they're doing.

Always have defense in case of an early attack.

, Carry lots of ammo, and make reloading as easy as possible. If you have a bandolier, use it.


If you are low on ammo, use it wisely. Only shoot if you are absolutely positive you won't miss.
If you need to reload, get behind cover before reloading your weapon.

, If you want, you can shoot the hostage before you deliver the note, however some people may see that as cheating.



Wear quiet shoes and be silent. Sneak up on enemies and grab them. You can try using them as a body shield if you want, or just keep them trapped, and use their weapons.

, Hide in corners if an enemy comes and wait for them to get close, and then shoot. If your gun is too long and they're too close, rifle butt. In the game you're supposed to act like your in pain for a minute, so take this opportunity to shoot your enemy and pick up your darts when you're done.


Have a camo shirt or blanket to cover yourself and snipe the opponents.
Beware of others hiding around a corner. You don't want to get shot going around a corner. Use a tactical entry into any rooms.

, Dropping your gun is a bad idea, as the enemy can pick it up or you could be without an offense.You could use your jammed gun for a shield or you could fake a shot and run away.

,, Run if you can't hold your ground. It's better to run away and come back with reinforcements than to get killed.


If you are surrounded, focus on a single side and make an escape. You have to be very careful, so that you don't get shot.

, Make it large but secure.


Have an ammo dump a your fort. Make sure you and your teammates have ammo at all times.

, If you see a dart coming, use your gun to shield it. If you shield successfully, they'll need to reload, so shoot now while they're weak. If you're on the other side of this, and your opponent uses their gun as a shield, hide before reloading, and be prepared for them to shoot quickly.

, To take down machine guns, come at them from behind. Or you could possibly take the two people with the biggest guns with you so you have protection.


Use a Nerf grenade called Lanard Scatter Blast Foam Dart Grenade. This is a great way to clear up a fort.

, This is called being a double agent; however, some people may see this as cheating.


If possible, steal valuable weapons from enemy base if you are under attack. Steal ALL if you think you can get away with it, and make it back to your base without dying.

If you need a Nerf shield, there is a shield in the N-Force series, and one comes with the Stampede.

Design your gun.,
Make body modifications.,
Spray paint your gun.,
Add details.",How to Upgrade Nerf Guns1," Take some time to think about what kinds of changes you want to make to the appearance of your Nerf gun. Do you want to change the colors? The shape? Or just add some minor customizations to personalize your gun? You may want to make a sketch or two to plan out your modifications.


Use your imagination--there are many different modifications you could make, depending on the look you want For the amount of work you are willing to put in. If you need some inspiration, there are many websites where people have posted their favorite Nerf gun modifications, sometimes with tips for creating similar looks.
The extent of the changes you want to make will determine the supplies you need and how extensive the project will be.;
, Depending on the type of gun you're starting with, you may wish to add components or even remove parts to create a more appealing look.


For example, some Nerf guns have large stocks that serve little or no function. If you have such a gun, you might want to saw off the stock to create a smaller gun.On the other hand, you might wish to add visual elements to your gun. You can use super glue, model glue, or rubber cement to add anything from parts of other Nerf guns, small items from toy, craft or hardware stores, or even to custom-created decorative elements, such the foam rubber blade added to a Nerf Maverick shown here.
Again, think creatively about additions you might want to make. The possibilities are endless!

, Many serious Nerf enthusiasts like to create custom looks for their guns with full-body paint jobs. This can be as simple as sanding the gun down and spray-painting it with a color you like.You must sand all the glossy surfaces down to make certain the spray paint will stick.
Disassembling the gun, or at least removing the larger parts and painting them individually, will allow for a more thorough paint job.
To get a multicolored look, you can paint your gun one color, let it dry, then tape over with masking tape the areas you want to remain that color. Then, paint the gun with another color of spray paint, let it dry, and remove the tape.

, Once your paint is dry, you can further customize your design with a paintbrush or permanent marker.


With a model brush and paints, you can add highlights that give your gun a metallic look, if desired."
"
Select the teams.,
Have the teams or the ref select a good amount of Nerf guns, around 6-8 if you have 2 teams of 2 versing each other.,
Have the REF take all the guns out of the team's sight, and place them all or some in a certain point(s) that are in the vicinity of the Nerf area.,
Let the ref start the game.",How to Have a Scavenger Nerf War," There should be at least 2 to a team, and two teams versing each other. Also, this is a critical part- you need to have one other person, sort of like a ref, if you will. Their job will show up later on in this article.
, Keep in mind that a player can only carry two weapons at a time, preferably your primary and secondary., Remember, it's very important the players don't see the ref placing the weapons down. Then, place the ammo down, either next to the guns, or not, whatever you prefer. Also, place down a small gun, like an N-Strike Reflex, along with all of these guns. This will be the medic gun, and so if someone on your team gets shot down, you can shoot them with the medic gun to revive them. Note, the medic gun can only be used twice per team in a game, so use your revivals wisely., On either side of the field, with the Nerf guns being fairly well hidden, and sort of in the center of the playing area, have the ref start the game. The goal, essentially, is to be the first team to find the weapons and target the other teams. Once the game is done, tally up the ""casualties"" and start the whole thing over again."
"
Make a dual magazine.,
Upgrade your ammo.,
Increase your gun's range and power.",How to Upgrade Nerf Guns2," A quick upgrade that can help you reload much faster is the creation of a dual magazine. If your Nerf gun uses a clip-style magazine, you can tape two of them together, with one upside down.


When you run out of ammunition, you can just flip it over and keep firing without having to locate a new clip or refill the old one.

, You can make your Nerf gun more accurate and powerful by weighting your foam darts.


You can use fishing weights, BB pellets, or even small rocks to weight your ammunition. Just find some that are the right size to fit snugly inside your darts, apply a small drop of hot glue, and push the weight down the small opening at the end of each dart., If your Nerf gun uses a spring or springs to fire darts, you can increase your range dramatically by putting in more powerful springs.


Take the gun apart and remove the springs. A 20 pound spring in a similar size to the one original to the gun will give you much more firepower, although you may need to reinforce the body of your gun with some PVC pipe, as the additional force can make the body fall apart.For advanced Nerf modifiers, you can further increase your range by replacing the barrel with a brass tube, and by removing the air restrictors that limit how much air can pass through the barrel. Specific details for these tasks will vary depending on your gun, but you can find instructions online for most newer guns."

, Place more valuable places toward the back, like the ammo magazine, or planning HQ., Note basic landmarks in the area.

, Take it in shifts to guard the base, using the base gun as your primary weapon. Have a sniper and patrol team in the area.

, Your choice of weapon and how you use it is vital. For example, using a stampede and keeping it on the whole time will give your base away in quieter areas. Also, the battery will run out halfway through the battle, leaving you with no suitable defense weapon. Suggestions include:


Primary: Vulcan/Havoc
Secondary: Night Finder/Firestrike
Tertiary: Secret Strike/Jolt

,,, Get ready to fire at the attackers.

, Flee the base.


As soon as you are in a secure location, Walkie-Talkie the other squadrons and tell them you have abandoned your base.
If you have made a new base, tell your teammates the co-ordinates of the new base.

, You may attempt to seize the base back. In this case, call for aid from the other squadrons, meeting them at your co-ordinates.

, Break the team into the following:


Rapid-fire gunners: This is the main fighting force. Arm with pistols, walkie-talkies and GPS.
Snipers: For taking out with convenience shots. Arm with pistols, possibly armed with Walkie-Talkie and GPS.
Pistol armed men: Infiltration and scout operations. Arm with two pistols each, walkie-talkies and GPS, maybe Nerf swords.
Rapid-fire gunners.

, Stop every 100 meters (328.1 ft) to listen for movement and rest. Keep your guns primed, and if battery operated keep them off.

, Take alternate directions, one person circling the enemy from the right, one from the left. Do not run, move silently.

, Then strike, shooting as many bullets as possible, making sure not to shoot your teammate. If the target is not hit, he or she will start to move away. Do not follow the enemy, stay and collect your ammo.

,, Make sure you’re fully loaded and primed, then when they cross the 10 meter (32.8 ft) boundary line, fire until you have one magazine left or all of the enemies are down. If the area is secure, stay to collect your bullets. If there are still enemies in the area, clear out as fast as possible.

, Dodge bullets by zigzagging across the battlefield until you are out of range and sight of their guns.

,
Prime your gun.
Scan the area.
Lie in ambush for an enemy to come by.

,, The enemy will then either move away or hide nearby and wait until you move to a different location and sniper you down.

,
If surprise attacked, get out of there! The enemy will have a higher rate of fire than you and have the advantage of speed, mobility, and the element of surprise.

, Be careful not to leave behind obvious footprints and to not drop items.

, Make sure you are not seen or heard. The enemy may lead you to his or her base or hideout.

, If he or she is with teammates, walkie-talkie the rapid-fire gunners, using the GPS to give them the co-ordinates of the enemy's base. Input these into your own GPS ,along with the co-ordinates of your own base.

, If attacked by rapid-fire weapons, run! Finally, if you’re attacked by snipers, hide in cover, then regroup and take them down from behind.

, Use two or more teammates to cover you. Work together and you are more likely to succeed.

, Much like other projectile-tagged games many Nerf strategies and actions are decided by the thought of fear. This is why retreating and falling back are common in Nerf offensives. The main things that create the fear are the rate of fire and the amount of ammunition. One of the most important factors in winning a Nerf battle/war is to never let the enemy know how much ammo one has., Break up the group as much as possible, sending a maximum of three people per small route, while the rest of the team holds larger routes defensively. This allows a smaller team to encircle and eliminate a more concentrated force that will most likely collect in the larger routes.

It is best to know the surroundings where one is fighting, this helps players know hiding spaces and areas with physical advantages.

Spots like these include hills, stairs, fences, and balconies.



, There are two basic strategies for this:

First is by using intimidation. This means using heavy fire against then enemy, regardless of accuracy.

The drawback to this strategy is that you will be using a lot of darts in a short amount of time. This strategy is best used when there is more than one base defender and they are equip with a motorized weapon. These weapons use a motorized system to continue to fire as long as the soldier continues to hold down the trigger, feeding either from a clip or pre-loaded darts. Examples are the barricade, stampede, vulcan, rayven, or the hail-fire, stryfe.


The second strategy is one of anti-intimidation where you don't shoot at all. Let the enemy get comfortable and approach then shoot them at the last moment.

If you’re facing multiple enemies, use your cover wisely as it is one of your biggest advantages over your enemy.
If they charge all at once, the best way to counter this is either using two pre-pumped magstrikes, or two vulcans.
If choosing the magstrike, always have your guns pre-pumped.



, Though it seems obvious, you should always be taking cover even when no enemy is in sight especially while reloading., They will jam your gun. Put all damaged darts in the damaged dart bin to be repaired., Try to make each shot count as you only have a limited number of darts and no guarantee that you will find any soon. If you are pinned down without darts you can be rushed easily., Small secondary weapons should always be loaded and ready in case you are rushed without any darts in your primary. Always go into battle with at least two guns., If they rush you, thinking you are an easy kill, prove them wrong., Before each battle have a couple of code words you use to send signals to each other that the enemy will not understand.

For example, ""eagle"" could mean everyone strike at once, ""mouse"" could mean you need more ammo, and ""snake"" could mean retreat back to base.
Try to keep the code words short and few in number since they should change every battle and everyone needs to be able to easily remember them.

, Going into battle with 10 guns may look cool, but you will soon find out that you cannot move easily and will get tired soon. Only use guns that you know how to use, that do not jam easily, and that are not too big for you to handle., This means that you should know your equipment. If the first time your blaster gets jammed and you do not know how to unjam it, then you are in trouble.

Only use guns you are familiar with. The most common kills will be the people who do not know their equipment well.

, When moving among barricades or obstacles have your fellow soldiers fire upon the enemy to keep them pinned down while you move closer or get into a better position., With this tactic one soldier positions himself at one angle and another soldier positions himself at an opposite angle so that their shots upon the enemy are coming from two opposite angles making it hard for them to return fire or take cover., In this method, a densely packed team of Nerfers, typically armed with more powerful blasters, such as Rhino-Fires, Vulcans, or Hail-Fires, use heavy firepower to disorient the enemy with short and powerful attacks. They then surround the enemy and may engage in melee battle if necessary., In this tactic, the team is divided into 2 parts offense to 3 parts defense.

The defense holds a line on the largest major routes while the offense attempts to secure minor routes.
If the offense is successful, the enemy team will have no choice but to try to overwhelm the defense in the center.
When in position, the defense caves in the enemy still hold the area. This will result in the enemy team falling deeper into the now bowl-shaped defensive line.
The offense then emerges behind the enemy team and takes defensive positions pointed towards the collected enemy team.
If done correctly, this leaves the enemy team surrounded and without cover. If the plan fails, the entire team can recover quickly by rushing, taking advantage of their already forward position.

, This strategy works best on smaller fields where there are less routes to travel. Similar to funneling, blading shares the goal of entrapping the enemy. While not always as effective, it is easier to recover from and requires less communication.

Your team cuts in a diagonal line across the field. The most powerful members of the team should be on the edges, with the weakest parts of the line in the middle. This leaves the enemy no choice but to attack the line, often focusing on the middle.
When the enemy is within the bounds of the line, collapse your team on top of them and redistribute your players.
This leaves your enemy surrounded an all but one side.

Note that the line described here is not a straight formation, but rather a loose description of the cover positions of your team.



, To use this tactic, you take the risk of running close to an enemy bunker and fire once or twice at the enemy close range, then run back for cover., Similar to Hit-N-Run, but instead of running back for cover you keep going past the enemy bunker shooting left and right at the enemy.

Try to get as deep into their territory as possible before being shot or finding cover behind enemy lines.

, This tactic is used when a group of soldiers is moving together and suspects an attack from a Nerf grenade -If close together they could all be hit by a single well placed grenade, but spread-out keeps this from being likely., This is any tactic used as a distraction. If you move up close to an enemy position you do not have to fire on them - you already are drawing all their fire by being so close. Meanwhile, your allies further back can pick off targets easily without being fired upon.

Other ways to craw a target is to trick them into thinking you are out of ammo. When they charge in for the kill, you unload your blaster into them.

, You will often need to.

You could also set a retreat point with your team in the field or if your base is over-run
Make sure only your team knows where the base is.

Reassemble your Nerf gun.",How to Spray Paint a Nerf Gun," Not all types of paint will look as good or last as long on your Nerf gun. One brand that historically works great is Krylon Fusion (for plastic), as the paint bonds to the plastic on the Nerf gun and makes the paint job last longer.Some enthusiasts prefer other spray paint brands, or vinyl dye sprays, which are available at auto parts stores.;
, Sanding and spray painting a Nerf gun — or anything else, for that matter — is not they type of project that you should try to tackle on your dining room table. Plan ahead both for safety and to contain the mess you’ll make. Work in a well-ventilated area, but in low-wind conditions. Put down an ample amount of paper, cardboard, or other protective material on your workspace. Follow the preparation and application instructions on the spray paint can., Spray paint adheres better and lasts longer on a clean surface. Some mild soap and a thorough rinse (and dry) will do the trick. However, an ammonia-based cleaner (such as a window spray) will better prepare worn plastics for painting, while paint thinner works best for brand new plastic items., Take apart your Nerf gun using a screwdriver. You only need to take off the panels that you feel need painting. Be cautious, because many Nerf guns have pieces under tension, and often springs, and these can escape at high speed once you open the gun.Take a photo of the internal layout of the gun before removing any pieces, so you'll have a guide for reassembly later.You can spray paint without disassembling if desired, but it’s easier to get complete coverage if you take the toy apart.

, A good sanding job will allow the paint job to last longer, so take your time on this step. Sanding will create more surface area for the paint to bond to. Sand each panel until it feels slightly rough. Use any general purpose sandpaper for the job.Wipe away dust and debris with a tack cloth before proceeding. Or, wash the toy again with a mild soap and water, and rinse and dry it thoroughly.
Whether or not you sand, be sure to wash every piece you intend to paint in order to remove mold-release chemicals that can interfere with paint adhesion.

, Apply painter's tape (masking and duct tape will work too, but they usually leave a sticky residue) so that the spray paint doesn't cover these sections. For masking fine details, you can trim out shapes from the tape with a sharp hobby knife.You can also tape over the black base coat you’ll apply next, after it has dried thoroughly, if you want certain sections to remain black. If you find that your finish paint color is leaking under your painter's tape, applying another layer of your base coat over the tape before applying your accent color can help.
Look online for examples of high-quality Nerf gun paint jobs. You may be inspired!, Apply two or more light coats of black spray paint. This process is called ""priming."" Priming makes the other finishing colors stick out more than they would if applied just by themselves. This is especially helpful if your Nerf gun has bold contrasting colors, like blue and orange or red and yellow.Start and end your spray pointed away from your target to avoid splatters.

, Wait at least ten minutes. It's important that the first layer of paint is dry so that new colors don't blend with the black. It's best not to let the paint dry in direct sunlight.Refer to the information on your paint's can for re-coat times.

, Take the color(s) of spray paint you want and spray several light coats over the black base coat (and any taped areas). Let the paint dry for ten minutes or more between coats. Remove any painter’s tape after applying the final coat, either before or after the paint has fully dried.If you mix types/brands of paint, test their compatibility on some scrap plastic or a part of the gun that won't show once assembled.

, If you want to add any fine details or touch up some hard-to-reach spots, use acrylic paints and fine-tipped acrylic brushes. Allow the paint to dry thoroughly between coats.Be extra cautious painting parts that see a lot of movement, like triggers and slides. Some of them move in places with very little room to maneuver, and even the increased thickness added by coats of paint can affect performance.

, This will give your new paint job a longer life, especially on areas prone to wear like handles and triggers. The application process will be very similar to applying the spray paint, but follow the instructions on the can.Let the clear coat dry thoroughly before reassembling the toy.

, After all the painted parts are completely dry, screw them back together and admire your work. Your Nerf gun paint job is now complete!


Refer to the photos you should have taken during disassembly if you need a refresher.

Improve your speed.,
Build up your endurance.,
Become stealthy.,
Improve your aim.,
Work on your agility.,
One of the things you need to work on to improve your agility is jumping.,
Practice climbing.,
Do footwork exercises regularly.,
Don`t forget to read the tips and warnings!

",How to Train Your Body for Nerf," Most people think that people who run fast are ""born fast"" or ""naturally fast"", and that if you're not naturally fast, it is impossible for you to become fast. That is not true. Yes, having certain body proportions will make you naturally faster than other people, but you can become fast through training and learning the proper technique. To improve your speed, you obviously need to train by doing sprints. For more details on how to train, you can check out How to Run Faster or How to Run Faster and Increase Your Quickness


When you've trained for a while, practice sprinting with a gun in your hand to get used to it. Then, after you've done that for a while, practice sprinting with Nerf gear on:

A gun in your hand
a secondary strapped to you
ammo on you.


You will feel bulky and weighed down at first, but you'll get used to it, and then you'll have an advantage over other Nerfers.;
, You're useless in a Nerf battle if you get tired within the first 10 minutes. You need to have energy throughout the entire battle. To build up endurance, choose one of the following sports and do 30 minutes of that each day:


Jogging






swimming






biking






or even jumping on a trampoline







, Learn how to walk, jump, and climb as quietly as possible. For more details, look at How to Be Stealthy and How to Be Stealthy Like a Ninja After you can walk, jump, and climb silently, do it with Nerf gear on and a Nerf gun. It will probably be a lot harder, but it you practice, you can become just as stealthy with Nerf gear on than without it.

, To start, just shoot at still, medium sized objects from 10-15 away. Practice at different angles. As you get better, shoot at smaller and smaller targets, and shoot from farther and farther away until you can shoot and hit a relatively small object from 25 feet (7.6 m) away within 3 shots. Once you can do that, practice shooting moving objects, because, do you think your target is going to be standing still? Probably not. Have someone roll or throw something, and you shoot it from about 10 feet (3.0 m) away. When you get better, shoot from farther away and shoot smaller objects. The last step to mastering aim is shooting objects while you're moving. Set up a still object. First, practice shooting the object while walking slowly. When you've mastered shooting while walking, slowly start going faster. Do not start walking/jogging at a higher speed until you have mastered the speed slightly slower than it. Complete mastery of this exercise is being able to sprint while shooting and hitting your target on the first try. To challenge yourself, you can run, then leap and shoot at the target object while you're in the air.

, Out of all the things you can work on to improve your Nerf skills, this is the most beneficial. What I mean by ""agility"" is being quick on your feet, being able to navigate any area with ease, and being able to overcome any physical obstacle.

, You need strong leg muscles so you can jump over things more easily, and also have a more powerful stride for running. Do squats and lunges to increase leg strength. Jumping on a trampoline is extremely helpful, also.

, Climb trees, walls, etc. Practice until you can climb practically anything with ease. Climbing will help you overcome obstacles in Nerf.

, There are lots of great ones out there you can do. Look on football or soccer training sites to help you.

, Look at tactics from previous battles. Go right back to ancient history - some of the tactics developed then are still in use today., This will help you to avoid stupid mistakes. Here's a few battles to get you started - look at who won and what tactics they used, and who lost and why. Sorry that they're all from ancient times.

Battle of Trebia
Battle of Trasimene
Battle of Cannae
Battle of Zama
Battle of Actium
Battle of Granicus
Battle of Issus
Battle of Gaugmela

, Really, I cannot sell this enough. It contains lots of invaluable advice on battle tactics and strategies. The idea ""know your enemy like you know yourself"" is from The Art of War., Don't overuse them - once you've used them once or twice, your enemies will wise up and learn how to defeat them. Here's a few ideas:

Night attack. Attack with a few men in the middle of the night. It might be pitch black, but if you only take a few men, you're far more likely to hit an opponent - and your opponents are more likely to hit each other than you.
Ambush. Surprise your enemy when they least expect it.
Pincer movement. Send out men to the sides, who then come in and attack the flanks of your enemy. This can be a very effective maneuver, especially if your opponent isn't expecting it. Look at the battle of Cannae: a battle where a Carthaginian army almost completely wiped out a Roman one. Some sources say that they killed over 70,000 roman troops. Despite it taking place in 216BC, it's still studied today as one of the greatest examples of a pincer movement.
Dodge charging enemies. The thing is, when you're charging it's hard to stop. If you just move your troops out of the way, then hit the charging troops as they go past, you can take them out very easily. Alexander the Great used this against the Persians.
Attack from above. Get on top of a hill, and then stay there! Your enemy will have to attack uphill, and you can just snipe them as they struggle towards you. Rain and mud can make them struggle even more.
Famous last stand. The name says it all, really. Use only as a last resort, if you have no other options.

, Tactics are more immediate, strategy is more long term. Tactics would be used to win a battle, but a good strategy can win the war. A good example of strategy is Fabian strategy: instead of attacking your opponent outright, send small parties to harass him. Cut off his food supply and disrupt his communications. Don't give him any big battles that he could use to boost his reputation., if you can take out your enemies without getting near them, good. Snipe them from a hilltop. Fire mortars at their position. Anything you can to take them out without getting close., If you can demoralise the enemy troops, there's always the possibility that they'll surrender without a fight (it has happened before)., The very first time that a tactic is deployed (right after it's creation), it is usually devastating. To their side if it's a good tactic, to yours if it's a bad one. Either way, a brand new tactic can quickly settle the battle."

Each survivor has a total of 3 lives.,
This game is played in rounds.,
Once darts or rockets have been shot, they cannot be used again.,
When zombies are hit, they have to ""die"" for 10 seconds.

The zombies can either run or walk.

,
To kill a player, a zombie has to grab a player and pretend to bite them.

,
The objective of the game is to find the object the zombies have hidden.",How to Play Nerf Zombie Apocalypse1,";
, A round is over when either all survivors are dead (This counts as one of their lives), or when they are out of ammo. They then return to the safe room until they are prepared for the next round. This continues until all survivors have no lives left, or they find the object.

, (Ignore this rule if you do not have a large amount of darts.) NOTE: If the survivors run completely out of ammo, the zombies should put darts out like they did in step 3 while the survivors are in the safe house.

,,,, Once it is found, all survivors must make it back to the saferoom (alive).

"
"
Gather all materials needed (see below).

,
First, divide players into unequal teams with the zombies having more people.,
Have the zombies make caches of ammo and weapons around the playing field.,
Give the each of the survivors small supplies of ammo (10-15 darts each) and a gun that uses that type of ammo.,
Establish a ""safe room"" where the zombies cannot enter and where the survivors store weapons and ammo; and also where they can retreat to.,
Now that you have the game set up, see above for rules and objectives.

",How to Play Nerf Zombie Apocalypse2,", For example, if you were playing with 7 people, 4 would be zombies and 3 would be 'survivors'

, Also, have the zombies hide an object. This step will be explained later on.

, (Streamlined with Recon and Longshot. Suction Whistler and Velcro with Maverick Vulcan and Nitefinder). Or have the players start with what they brought.

, If you don't have a room simply use a designated area for humans where zombies are not allowed to go.

Get new nite finders.,
Get lots of ammo, since you are using only two night finders, darts can run out very easily.,
Always hide.,
Use one nite finder at a time, using two will be very hard to reload, resulting on you getting shot.,
Try to practice running and aiming at the same time, running will decrease the possibility of you getting shot and aiming makes your shot more accurate and you will waste less ammunition.

,
Sneak up to enemies.,
Try to gain the higher ground.,
Learn to quickly reload your gun since you have single firing pistols, this way you can reload on the run or when you are overwhelmed.

Distract the enemy.,
Try not to rush into battle, remember you only have night finders.

,
Try to fight in the dark or at night.,
Make shield, this is because you are totally exposed and your gun can't be a barrier since it is so small.

,
Use tactics which involves speed, moving is always better.

",How to Win a Nerf 1 on 5 War with Only Two Night Finders," You don't want your guns to be useless in the middle of the war.;
, Also, if people in the war have more than one life, it is impossible to win with only six darts.

, You don't want to run around with two night finders getting shot down every second. Hiding also means that the enemy won't know where you are and you might get to surprise them.

, You can also aim better using one at a time.

,, Since you only have pistols, you can sneak up to people easily without making a lot of noise.

, Your opponents will often carry rifles or machine guns, thinking that these guns will win you, but a lot of these type of guns are either less accurate or has less ranges than you two night finders. Carrying a big gun can also decrease your mobility and making you slower.

,, This will make shooting them much easier.

,, This way you are less likely to be spotted and you also have the advantage on how you have the built in flashlight on the night finders.

All players should have at least some experience with Nerf, as it streamlines gameplay.
All players must be unafraid of the dark.
If you are planning to invite a large group, it is helpful to include at least a few people who've already played Assassins before.
A good group size for the average game is 15, as it provides varied and interesting gameplay, but is not so large as to be uncontrollable.
Don't be afraid to invite a diverse group: A variety of personalities can improve team interaction and strategy.;
, Everyone needs a weapon, but many people prefer to use different weapons for different game roles.

A diverse collection of guns is important: different roles require different weapon choices.
An easy way to get enough weapons for everybody is to ask people to bring their own guns.
Melee weapons can work, but house rules may not allow them, due to the danger of broken furniture.

, This game requires that you reload your gun from whatever is around you, so a fair number of darts is required.

A good rule of thumb is that you should have enough darts to load each weapon 2-4 times.
Your dart collection should reflect your weapon diversity- if half your weapons use Mega darts, then you should have extra of these available.

, This game is designed to be played inside and requires at least 2 rooms: a staging area, and arena room or rooms.

The staging area can be as large or small as you want, but the arena's total area needs to be at least the size of a standard living room
As the game is played in the dark, either choose an area with few windows, such as a basement, or play at night.
If the arena is one room, then set up obstacles and furniture to use for cover.

, ""Assassins"" involves three roles, Assassin, Guard, and Target.

To choose roles, you can let people volunteer, or you can simply use random chance to decide.
Guards should outnumber assassins by a 3:2 or 3:1 ratio.
There is only one Target.

,

The Target chooses their weapon first, then the Assassins, followed by the Guards.
The type of weapons you can use depend on your role.
The Assassins aren't allowed to use automatic or semi-automatic weapons.
Guards are allowed to use any weapon, but should generally avoid sniper-type guns, as these are ineffective in this role.
Depending on house rules, the Target can either use any weapon, or can only use pistols.

, The room needs to be in complete or near-complete darkness. If you are playing during the day, block all windows in the arena room(s).

If you have them, use blackout curtains to block the windows
You can also tape cardboard over the window, or hang up sheets or blankets.
Don't turn off the lights just yet: The Assassins do this at the start of the game.

, Take a small object, such as a ball or stuffed animal. (It helps if it is translucent.) Place the object next to or on top of a small light source

The light should be visible from anywhere in the room, but not enough to illuminate the area (pointing it up towards the ceiling helps with this).
After the game has begun, no one but the Target may touch the goal object.

,

The Guards and the Target should now enter the staging room and close the door.
They may enough darts to load their weapons once or twice (once for large capacity guns, twice for small).
The Guards can discuss their strategy and make plans, but they are not allowed to leave the staging room until the game begins.
The Assassins remain in the arena while the guards leave.
The Assassins may move obstacles to create outposts and hiding places, so long as a clear route remains open from the staging room to the goal object.

, The Assassins must turn off the light before the game can begin.

Once the light is off and the Assassins are in position, they must shout to inform the Guards that they are ready.
The Guards and Target may now emerge from the staging room at any time. However, they are not required to enter immediately.
The entire team must emerge together- no one can remain in the staging room.

, If you are hit anywhere on your body, you are dead/disabled. Finger shots, hand shots, friendly fire, etc. all count as an elimination hit.

If you get hit, you immediately must fall to the ground and go limp. You are permitted to shout as you fall, but afterwards may not say anything.
Once you are out, you can move slightly to avoid being stepped on, but may not continue to grip your weapon or make any other muscle motion.
Both your teammates and your opponents are allowed to take your gun and/or ammunition. You are not permitted to take any action to prevent or encourage this.
Honor code applies here. If you get hit, don't pretend that it missed, as that just makes the game less fun for everyone. Gameplay typically only lasts a few minutes, so you'll be back in the game before long!

, When the Target touches the door, the Guards/Target immediately win.
Guards: Protect the Target, and eliminate the Assassins. If the Target succeeds in retrieving the goal object, or all Assassins are eliminated, Guards and Target win.
Assassins: Eliminate the Target. If the Target is eliminated, the Assassins immediately win

, Once one of the three game objectives is met, then turn on the lights as quickly as possible to prevent injury.

Return all guns to the center, but leave the darts scattered around the room.
You can now choose new roles, and begin the game again.

Get a good gun for modifying.,
Assemble the tools necessary for basic mods.,
Learn to make ""stefans."",
Invent your own mods.",How to Modify a Nerf Gun1," There are lots of different styles and designs of Nerf guns, but the basic models are usually the best for modifying, since they're the most common. If you want to get started, getting a basic spring or pump gun will be the cheapest option that will allow you the most variety.You can start master-keying a sniper rifle later. Start small and learn the two basic categories of Nerf weaponry:


Spring guns are activated by an internal spring that is compressed by racking a plastic slide on the back of the gun between every shot. This compresses the spring, which launches the foam dart. The Nerf Maverick is the most commonly modified spring gun.
Pump guns are activated with air pressure created by pumping the gun, much like some water guns work. These guns have a great potential to increase the power and accuracy of shots with some simple mods. The basic pump model is the Big Blast, though this isn't made by Nerf, technically.;
, You don't need to actually do much to make some slight modifications on basic Nerf guns, but you will need a few tools aside from the blaster itself. If you're under 15, it's a good idea to have your parents help you with any tools or cutting that might be necessary. To do the modifications described in the following sections, you'll need:


A hand-saw
Philips head screwdriver
Sandpaper
Dremel drill or metal file
Wire clippers
Replacement parts, if you want to upgrade

, The word Nerf is an acronym that stands for ""non-expanding recreational foam,"" which is made mostly of polyurethane. Each blaster you buy at the store with come with a short supply of Nerf darts, but get real. The little things are easy to lose and too expensive to buy at the store. One of the best basic mods to learn as you're getting started is how to make your own darts and save money. A general method has been developed by Nerf-enthusiasts, and they're usually referred to as ""stefans."" There are various ways of making stefans, but the simplest is described here. You'll need to complete the mods described below to use them.You will need half-inch foam backer rod to cut the darts. This is also sometimes called ""caulk saver"" and is available at any home repair store, usually with the winterizing supplies and caulking materials. It should look familiar (it's the same basic material as Nerf darts). The backer rod will usually be curled up in a loop, which means you'll have to straighten it out before you cut it into individual darts. Most people do this by taping them flat, to a table or some other flat surface for about a day and letting it flatten out naturally.
To weight the darts, most people use either BB's or fishing weights. You'll also need scissors and hot glue to make stefans.
Cut the foam rod into two-inch sections and make a tiny hole in one end to insert the BB or the fishing weight. Use a small dab of hot glue and attach the weight, then let it dry.

, Everybody's got their own little tricks and opinions about the best hacks and mods for Nerf guns, and everybody likes different guns. There's no ""right"" way to do it. The best way to learn is to learn to take apart the gun and see how it works, then start developing your own ideas and mods and trying them out.

Remove all the screws holding the housing together.,
Remove the cylinder and unscrew the cap.,
Clip off the barrel posts.,
File the nubs off the end plates for the ""Russian roulette"" mod.,
Upgrade the spring.,
Consider replacing the barrel.",How to Modify a Nerf Gun2," The first step to modifying a spring-activated Nerf gun is to take it apart and examine the internal components. The housing of most guns is two plastic halves held together by Philips-head screws. Larger guns will have more screws, but the smaller hand-held pistol style blasters will sometimes have as few as three.









Remove the screws with your screwdriver and set them aside. Pull the two halves of the gun together to reveal the internal components. One side should just be a shell, and all the parts should be attached to the other side.

, If you're modifying a Maverick (the easiest way to start), the most common beginner mod is to remove the air restrictors and the barrel posts, which keep you from being able to use stefans, and which decrease the power behind each shot. To do this, you need to pull the cylinder loose, where the darts are kept before they're fired.









The cylinder that holds the darts should pull out without having to pull very hard. Just grab it in your hand firmly and pull it back out away from the shell of the gun. With it should come a gray or beige plastic endplate, which you'll need to remove.
Usually the endplate is attached with a little orange cap you can pop off using the flat end of a screwdriver, or just using your fingers. Don't lose this cap, or you won't be able to reassemble the blaster.

, Nerf-brand darts are hollow, and slide onto a post in each barrel of the blaster. For a long time, this kept people from being able to make your own darts. Fortunately, you can just clip them off. Remove the end cap with the barrel post from each cylinder and use wire-clipper or some other type of lopper to cut them off, as close to the endplate as possible.









If you want, you can sand up the nub that you leave with some sand-paper to clean up the end. It's not necessary, but it'll be cleaner.
Reassemble the cylinder by attaching the orange plastic end caps to each of the cylinders and putting the cylinder chamber back together. You're ready to turn your attention to the end plates.

, Remove the gray plastic plate from the end of the cylinder, if you haven't already and find the little arc-shaped plastic nub on the side of it. This is used to stop the cylinder from spinning freely, so you can rotate the chamber in the gun like you're Jesse James. This won't make the gun shoot any differently, but it looks awesome.


If you want to complete this mod, file off the nub using a metal file, or a Dremel drill. Smooth it up as much as possible to make the plastic flat, so the chamber won't catch on it. If it doesn't, it won't spin right. Make sure you get help and permissions if you're using a power tool.
Reattach the end plates to the blaster and put the cylinder back in the gun. If you wanted about 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) more distance out of your gun and the ability to spin the chamber, you're done. Put the housing back together.

, If you want more power out of your gun, upgrade to a stronger spring. Examine the firing components of the gun, pulling the spring loose. It's a cheap, flimsy piece of metal, that you can easily upgrade with a trip to the hardware store. Take the spring with you to look for a spring that matches the width and length, and buy one made of a higher quality material.


Sometimes, replacing the spring will leave you with a little gap at the back of the gun, where the spring won't go flush with the plastic. To remedy this, you can use a small stack of pennies–three or four should do–to slot in and give the spring something to rest against. The pennies should fit into the chamber perfectly.

, Some really power-obsessed modders like to cut the barrel off the end of the blaster and replace it with a length of PVC pipe that matches the width of their stefans. Keeping a tighter seal and increasing the pressure of the spring can make the darts go much farther and faster.


If you want to do this, cut off the barrel of the gun just where it meets the ""body"" of the gun, and discard it. Cut a length of half-inch diameter PVC pipe that matches the rough length of the barrel, and hot-glue it into place carefully, holding it to complete the seal. It's best to glue around the outside, to avoid little nubs of glue on the inside.
If you like the way the gun looks, don't do this. Barrel replacements look pretty bootleg, and you'll gain a little power, but make your gun look kind of ridiculous.

Remove all the screws and expose the internal components.,
Remove the pump assembly.,
Plug the pressure release valve with hot glue.,
Improve the seals.,
Test it out and use caution when pumping.",How to Modify a Nerf Gun3," Nerf doesn't actually make many air-pressure pump guns, but many people refer to all foam blasters as ""Nerf guns,"" so this is a common mod in Nerf circles. These guns are typically primed by pumping a primer about five times to build up air pressure, which then shoots the gun. A plastic release valve is included for safety purposes, keeping the gun from exploding. You can plug that valve and get more power out of your gun, as long as you're careful.








, On a pump-action gun like this, the pump should come loose in one easy piece. It should have a long insert and a thicker chamber that's used to fill with air, a bit like a bike pump or some other kind of pressure pump. Pull it loose, as it shouldn't be screwed into anything after you remove the housing.


Unscrew the end cap and pull the primer from the air chamber housing. It should have an end piece with a little rubber seal around it, which is used to create friction and pump the air.

, On the end of the chamber where the air is pumped, there should be a little open release valve, which is basically just a hole. This is used to let some air escape if you over-pump the gun, creating too much pressure. If you plug this hole, you can get a lot more strength out of your blaster.


Use a small dot of hot glue over the hole, smoothing it out and making sure it seals and covers the hole completely. Let it dry thoroughly before moving forward.
Please note that the release valve is included to keep the plastic from breaking and popping open when you fill the chamber with pressure. It's toy-grade plastic we're talking about here, not strong metal, so you'll run the risk of breaking the gun completely if you do this, making it irreparable. You might get more power out of it, but only for a short period of time before it breaks.

, Another way to increase the power is to remove the black rubber O-rings from the plunger in the air pump and replace them with thicker rubber. This will create a tighter seal around the pump, creating more pressure and more power with each shot. Again, if you've plugged the release vale, this could be a stressful amount of pressure on the plastic, so be aware and be gentle if you do this.


Remove the rubber seal and take it to the plumbing section of the hardware store to look for seals. Get one with the same diameter, but a thicker gauge. It should feel much snugger in the barrel, and more difficult to pump. That's because there's more pressure in the barrel.

, It's likely you'll only need to pump the gun once or twice to get a lot of pressure into it. Don't start pumping away like you're trying to pump up an air mattress, or the gun will break. Be very careful to avoid cracking the gun and breaking it for good.

,, Tell both teams the date and time you pick.

, You can make up your own rules, use the rules below, or play one of the games listed in part 2 of this article.


West Coast Rules: Each soldier has five hit points. When a soldier is hit, he loses one point. He then counts down from 20 with his gun held up in the air. He may pick up ammo and walk around, but isn't allowed to fire and cannot be hit during this time. He counts down the last five numbers loudly and says he/she's back in, and is then back in the game. He leaves the game permanently if he is down to zero hit points.
East Coast Rules: Each player has ten hit points, and loses one point each time they are hit. There is no 20-second invulnerability period, like from the West Coast rules, but if several darts from the same automatic weapon hit you at the same time, this typically only counts as one hit. You leave the game once you are out of hit points.

, Hide them on the battlefield. Make a map of where they are located, and make copies to give to each of your soldiers. They can get out the map, look at it, and get a refill when they run out.

, Never play in an open field, you need cover for when the enemy shoots at you. Playing in the woods is highly suggested. If you're playing in the woods, behind bushes or trees or even large rocks are good enough.

, You and your soldiers can use them when you're on the battlefield. Just make sure your soldiers can remember them and your enemies don't find out!!

, You don't need much structure to have a fun Nerf war. Pick one of the rules (West Coast or East Coast) for getting hit described in that step. Divide the group into teams and separate onto opposite ends of the area before you begin the game. You can even have a free-for-all, with each player fighting every other player until one remains.

, Each team keeps a flag (or any other recognizable object) near the ""base"" they start out in, but far enough away that it's difficult to defend from the base. The team that brings back the flag from the enemy's side wins the game.

, The Defender team gets to choose a defensive position, often a play structure or an area of high ground with plenty of cover. If the Defender team survives for 10 minutes, it wins the game. If the Attacker team knocks all the Defenders out of the game before then, it wins.


Optionally, you can have a Defender leave the fort and become an Attacker once he is hit three times. This may be a good idea if the Fort is especially easy to defend.

, This is a simple game of tag played with a single Nerf gun. When someone is hit, they take the Nerf gun. The last person to avoid getting hit by a Nerf dart wins.

, If the barrel doesn't come out, hit the barrel back in, push the pump in or out (depending on which way works) and try again.

, (There will be a bit less than a centimetre there).

, This will switch all the ammunition you added to one of four chambers. Each chamber houses about 10 pieces of ammunition.

,, Do not force the barrel on to the gun, this might brake it.

, What are you waiting for? To shoot once, simply pull the handle back and then push it forward. To shoot rapidly, pull the handle back and then push it forward repeatedly and fast.

Fire away.",How to Easily Modify a Nerf Longshot2," You will need to have access to the inside of your gun, so remove the screws on the stock and body of the gun.


The screws on the stock are a different size than those on the rest of the gun, so make sure to keep them separate to make it easier when you put the gun back together.

, You will be working primarily with the part of the gun that contains the spring. This is the part that is made up of a thick cylinder connected to a thinner cylinder that runs along the middle portion of the gun. It is called the plunger tube.


In order to remove this piece, you will have to remove the internal screw located directly to the lower right corner of the larger cylinder of the plunger tube.
Once you have removed this main piece, cut off the black rectangular piece of plastic that is connected loosely to the thinner cylinder.

, The wider cylinder is closed off at the end by a black piece of plastic. (This is the end of the piece around which the spring is coiled inside the cylinder; this will come up later.) Remove the screws that hold this piece on, and then pull out the long piece of plastic with the spring around it. Put this piece aside for now. When you look down the plunger tube, you should see another piece of plastic that blocks you from seeing the other end. The center part of this piece is held in place by 3 prongs.

, Using your pliers (you need long-necked pliers for this part), cut the three prongs. Turn the plunger tube upside-down so that the loose pieces fall out. Now you will be able to see through the whole tube, but there will still be a peg-shaped piece of plastic that partially blocks the tube.

, Put your screwdriver into the plunger tube so that the end of the screwdriver is located in the center of the peg. Use a hammer to hit the fat end of the screwdriver until you knock out the peg. Now you will be able to see completely through to the other end.

,


Find the piece of plastic that holds that spring that you took out and put aside earlier. #*Unscrew the end so that you can remove the spring.
Take off the spring and replace it with a more powerful spring.

Nobody likes a fight against a toy.;
, Ask them what are they best at.

, The perfect Nerf squad normally has a balance of power, stealth, speed, and accuracy. The key is to find people that fit these descriptions. For each team member, select as follows:

If they're best with the Retaliator or the Rampage, they'll probably be in the speed category.
If they're best with the Vulcan or the Rapidstrike, they'll probably be in the power category.
If they're best with the Fire Strike or the Strongarm, they'll be best in the stealth category.
If they're best with the Longshot or the Longstrike, they'll be best in the accuracy category.

, They will need to get along with you and each other, its best not to let total strangers into your squad. They will also need a leader, as their leader you will need to be focused, have a good voice for giving orders, and you will need to know how to use all the weapons in your Nerf arsenal, not just a few.

, A successful Nerf squad has at least five people as members of the squad if not 10, its always good to have at least two of each category., The following describes good classes or roles in Nerf combat:


Commander. The ""Commander"" should use an Alpha Trooper, as they are a lightweight and perfect gun for combat,while sharing with the squad tactics and war plans.






Assault. The ""Assault"" unit should use a Retaliator CS-12, Rampage CS-25, Alpha Trooper CS-12 or the Rapidstrike CS-18. These guns are all perfect for the main task of hanging around the enemy base.






Sniper. The ""Sniper"" unit should use a Longshot CS-6 or a Longstrike CS-6 or a Tri-Strike CS-10 for the work he/she must do. They supply support for the team while taking out high value targets.






Support.The ""Support"" unit should use a Havokfire or a Hyperfire for giving allies covering fire, they must also be protective of the ""Commander"", as a ""Sniper"" could be watching! Although optional, the ""Support"" role can give squad members ammunition if they are given it by the ally requiring one






Engineer. The ""Engineer"" is an optional class, they should use a Rampage or a Stockade while maintaining the condition of allies weapons if they jam bad enough for them to have to fix.






Medic.(If the game-type includes revives, then this class is necessary)Also optional, the ""Medic"" should use primarily pistols or light rifles while giving allies revive buffs to help with the war effort!






Gunner: Has full firepower and can take on rough challenges, like getting past an invasion. The Gunner should carry a Rapidstrike and should have 5 grenades. A Gunner can take five hits, unless healed by the Medic.






Recon: Needs to be very sneaky and fast. The Recon Soldier should carry a medium blaster, and a knife. They can take two hits, unless healed by the Medic.







, Every member of the Nerf squad will have different tools depending on their role.


The Commander should carry a Retaliator CS-12 and 3 Nerf magazines.






The Sniper should carry a Longstrike CS-6 or Longshot and Retaliator CS-6 and 3 Nerf magazines. (grenades are optional, but recommended)






The Medic should carry a first aid kit and a Firestrike, or a Strongarm.






The Gunner should carry a Hyperfire and 3 Nerf magazines.






The Engineer should carry a wrench, Nerf turrets, and a rough cut.






The Recon should carry a Firefly REV-8, a Nerf Dagger and a pistol.







, Once you have assembled your Nerf squad, give them specific duties such as, the snipers should be stationed in the trees and double as lookouts, the assault troops should have half their men on the front lines and the other half protecting the heavy machine gunners, the assassins or spies should be behind enemy lines or waiting in strategic positions to pounce on the enemy.

, The mods will make your blasters a lot more powerful.

,


Pack your small blasters in it. You can also add food.







,,,, These will be useful if the war gets dragged out for a while.


Keep your strength up. Bring along bottled water and two or three energy bars.







, You'll need to be fit, able to run and get into hiding spots with ease.

,


If you want to, have ranks such as Trooper, Defender, and Sniper.






Divide and group into squads of three. The more people you have, the stronger you are.







, You'll need them.

, Know what your opponent's strengths are and find ways to prevent or block them.

, Cover hides and shields you, concealment only hides you.


Do not be loud unless your Nerf gun is. Little noise is good for sneaking, as you won't be heard as easily. Preferably wear socks for this.







, Some of the strategies that you can discuss and analyze with your team ahead of the Nerf war include:


Do not charge directly into a group of enemies. It's just that simple.






Have a camp to fall back to if you get in a jam.






If you see someone with a Vulcan that isn't on your side, sneak up from behind and ambush 'em.







, Everyone should be totally comfortable with the weapons, with concealment and stealthy movement and with the strategies devised.


Break your own team into smaller teams for practice, and play against each other. That way, you can see different perspectives and begin to understand how the opponents are probably thinking.

Select your primary weapon.,
Your secondary weapon should be your second best gun.,
Your backup weapon should be a smaller weapon like the jolt or triad.

,If you are a scout, a popular load out is a recon/retaliator with a maverick/strongarm, and a triad/jolt

,
If you are a sniper, popular weapon choices would be a Longshot, Longstrike or centurion.,
if you are a heavy, (which means you carry a lot of gear) good weapons would be a Stampede/rapidstrike, a hail-fire, a rayven, a stryfe, a rhino-fire, a sledgefire, slingfire, a demolisher 2-1, or any semi-auto or fully-auto weapon will do.,
If you are doing an outside war, it is optional to get a backpack/pack (or and bag if necessary) that will carry all ammo, guns, depending on how long the war is ( bandoliers and nerf blaster sleeves are also available ).,
If you can, make a holster out of the box your secondary gun came in.,
This is optional: Carry a Secret Strike and extra ammo in your pockets.

,
Always carry a melee weapon if allowed.",How to Create a Nerf Arsenal," This should be your farthest shooting and best gun. It should be comfortable and easy to use, basically the gun you like best. there is no best gun, different people prefer different things. the most common primaries people use are: a recon cs-6/retaliator, longshot cs-6/ or longshot cs-12, stampede/rapidstrike, cam ECS-12/rotofury and a raider/rampage.;
, Make sure it will be a good combo with your primary. the most common secondary most people use is the maverick/strongarm, as these both are cheap and dependable. some other secondary opinions are: firesrike/nite-finder, flipfury, sidestrike, and maybe even a barrel break/rough cut 2x4

,,, you could even use a BuzzBee rangemaster or predator. A scope is optional because most nerf/buzz bee scopes don't help you aim better., bring more ammo than you think you will need, because if you are spraying and preying, your going to run out of ammo pretty quickly. ( any secondary and backup will do.) If you do not have more ammo or you can not afford it so you will have to include more guns in your nerf arsenal., Snacks and water are also optional. Getting a bag and putting your gear in it would be better than walking around balancing your weapons and worrying if you'll drop something. Note: A small bag on your belt loop would do well.

, This way you have quicker access to it than if it was in a backpack. Go to https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Nerf-Holster as it will tell you how to make a holster for your nerf gun.

,, This will be a great advantage if you run out of ammo. Some melee weapons are: Marauder long sword/vantage sword, shadow fury short sword/thunder fury short sword, battlemaster mace/warlock axe, Vendetta double sword, stonewall shield and sword and klaw hatchet ( some of these are now discontinued by manufacturer ).

"
Think, is it a Nerf war with more than 20 people?,
Try to take their weakness into effect, So, if they have 3 Nite Finder, 2 Vulcans, and a Longshot, you stay at distance and bomb their Long shots and Vulcans because they're strongest, but Longshot first because they have the most distance, then the Vulcans second because when on machine gun mode, they will devastate your forces.

,
Try to counteract their guns strengths, Not just roles but guns.,
Now, draw it out and see what would happen if the opponent did different things, like if you use a decoy to bring some of the opponents soldiers near your well-hidden snipers to pick them off, what would happen if they sent a group of snipers or gunner?,
Think of something like trying to use 1-20 combat, or berserker tactics, where you get the person who has had the worst day, load him up with as many Vulcans as he can carry, secondaries on his back and swords in his belt, then send them out with 20 shot protection.",How to Create a Nerf Tactic," What guns do they have? How much ammo? What type of terrain, wind and weather, and who are you going against?;
,, Like getting a gunner with a Vulcan to go all crazy machine gun on you while you block or dodge his attacks, he'll run out of ammo having to pull out a secondary, which will probably be a Maverick, Nitefinder, or occasionally a backup Vulcan, Longshot, or Raider. If they have a weaker backup weapon, you should go in, and corner them, then bomb them.

, The decoy would be dead and the snipers would have to flee.

, Tactics may vary.

"
"
Get information about the general's location, weapon, etc.,
Learn to stalk your target without being seen.,
Try to camouflage with your surroundings.,
Be stealthy.,
Use a gun that is very accurate such as the Spectre REV-5, if you wish to score a headshot.

,
If there are guards, pick them off one by one.,
Move in.,
Be happy that you have now completed your mission!

",How to Kill a Nerf General," Send in a spy or double-agent to find out information. A double-agent is someone who pretends to be joining the enemies' army, and are figuring out information about the enemy. When the enemies' army needs the double-agent most, he brings back the information to his army. Information about the general will be very useful, because if the general has has a machine gun, you can use a nerf shield. If he has a long-strike, you can sneak up on him, because he will most likely be looking through the sights a lot. If you find him, and he doesn't see you, then hold him hostage. And, of course, you will need to know the general's location.;
, This must be practiced before it is attempted. Watch your target from a distance through binoculars until you are ready to shoot at the general.

, If it is dark, wear grey. If you are in a grassy meadow, wear green and brown, or wear a ghillie suit. A ghillie suit will make you look like a bush or the grass, and you will be able to shoot without being seen.

, Learn to Walk Silently so that you can sneak up on the general and hold him hostage, or to get into position to shoot quietly.


If you hold the general hostage, you will need another armed person with you, so that you don't get captured instead of the general. If you are successful in holding the general hostage, do not let him escape, because you will have a huge advantage over the enemies. They may try to free the general, so set traps, and hide. Also, have two people need the general.

,, Don't take them all on at once. Kill them quickly before they alert the general of your arrival.

, Once all the other steps have been completed, you are now ready to move in for the kill. Do it silently. Try to bring 2 other armed people with you so that if the general attempts to run, you can outnumber him, and he won't be able to outrun you.


Try to chase him into a dead-end so that you can either kill him or hold him hostage.

Consider using “bladed” weapons, some examples are: warlock, swift justice, vigilance, morroder, vendetta sword and strikeblade.",How to Choose a Nerf Gun for Your Play Style," Throw yourself fearlessly into the heat of battle. Don’t wait for your enemies to bring the fight to you—get out there and take it to them! Players who take the commando approach don’t stand still for very long, and fare better with guns that shoot quickly, reload easily and have a high ammo capacity.If you plan on jumping into the thick of things, grab a gun with a quick rate of fire that can hold a lot of darts, like the N-Strike Raider CS-35, retaliator or a rapidstrike. If you want to use customizable guns, use the stryfe or the modulus ecs-10 blaster Be sure to pack a secondary weapon such as the disruptor for when your main gun runs out of ammo.;
, Hang back and defend home base or keep critical pathways covered by laying down defensive fire. Defensive players tend to post up in one place and maintain a limited amount of movement within the area. For these folks, weapons that fire in powerful bursts at close range will be ideal. Try the classic Nerf Ballzooka if you want to pack a punch, or the Zombie Strike FlipFury Blaster, which gives you two fully loaded cylinders to cut down on reload time.Mounted machine guns and heavy artillery with large magazines are ideal for careful, defensive players.

, If you’re playing in a more open space, you have the option of eliminating targets from a distance as a sniper. Nerf sniper rifles fire darts from long range with greater precision than assault-style weapons and pistols. Designated snipers can be a great asset to securing victory in a Nerf war, especially when you’re playing with large teams. The Longstrike CS-6 and Mega Centurion are generally regarded as Nerf's most well-rounded sniper models, though you might also fare well with the silence and range of a bow and arrow, such as the sleek and minimal Mega Lightning Bow. Some crossbows such as the Elite Crossbolt are also very accurate with a high capacity. You can be a sniper for defense too. If you're out of darts, have a magazine/clip refill and if you have a storage stock, store a clip in it. If your sniper is completely out of ammo, have an accurate pistol or even a silent-strike blowdart pipe. Some examples of accurate pistols are Falconfire, firestrike and clearshot.Patient players with good aim make the best snipers.
When sniping, keep yourself concealed to avoid being forced into a showdown.

, Do a little bit of everything. Run, jump, take cover, strike from a safe distance or get up close and personal to do your damage. Though different Nerf weapons have different functions and characteristics, it’s more about how you play the game. If you’re just in it to have a good time, you can make almost any type of gun work for you.Simpler is better for players who frequently play many different roles.
Nerf’s Zombie Strike line makes for good all-around weapons, with average range, decent ammo capacity and simple firing mechanisms., Once you have your play style or role as part of a team figured out, equip a gun of the right size to help you accomplish your mission. Heavily-armed defensive or stationary players will be able to make use of heavier guns like the N-Strike Elite Rampage or the Strongarm Blaster, whereas player who need to be mobile and quick on their feet should opt for less bulky weapons like the Elite Retaliator or classic N-Strike Maverick.Nerf guns can get quite heavy. The N-Strike Stampede ECS, for instance, weighs in at a whopping 5 pounds. This can make them hard to wield effectively if you tend to be quicker on your feet., Make sure you’ve got enough munitions to survive the round. Snipers and players who pick their shots carefully will be able to get by with weapons that hold fewer darts. The run-and-gun types, however, will want to either stockpile extra cartridges or arm themselves with a high-capacity wrecking machine like the Vortex Pyragon Blaster or the dreaded Lawbringer.Load up on extra Nerf magazines (sold separately) so that you can reload mid-game in the blink of an eye.
Certain Nerf guns like the Lawbringer and the Hammershot are cylinder loaded, which means it’s easy to scoop darts right up off the ground if you need to quickly reload on the spot., Why rush in and risk a make believe suction-tipped demise when you can pick off your friends from across the backyard? Set up a sniper post and wreak havoc on your foes from far away. Long-range weapons like the Longstrike CS-6, Mega Centurion or even a Nerf bow-and-arrow can help you accomplish this feat while putting yourself at minimal risk.Nerf’s long range weapons can send darts flying up to 100 feet.
One tradeoff of ranged weapons is that they don’t hold as many darts and often take longer to reload.

, You’ve got two hands—why not use two guns? Simply pick up an extra weapon and keep those trigger fingers working overtime. Try it with smaller, easier to handle sidearms like the Hammershot, stryfe, Triad EX-3, firestrike or even primary weapons like slingfire and hyperfire. What you’ll lack in ammo capacity and precision, you’ll make up for in having two of them. After all, it works in the movies!Take time to line up your shots. It can be easy to burn through ammo when you’re carelessly firing two weapons at once.

, When the big guns run out of ammo, you’ll need to keep a smaller sidearm on you to stay in the game. This is when pistol-style shooters come in handy. Tuck a Sidestrike, Elite Mega Cycloneshock or Elite Jolt Blaster into your waistband and switch over once your primary weapon is spent or experiences an unfortunate but inevitable jam. It may just be the thing that pretend-saves your life!Make sure you save a few darts for your sidearm. Many of the more compact Nerf guns only hold between 1-3 darts.
These types of guns are easier to dual-wield, provided you’ve got the means to carry them.

, Opt for a bow and arrow over a point-and-shoot device in situations where you need to be swift, silent and deadly. Nerf bows shoot long, sleek “arrow” darts impressively long distances with pinpoint accuracy. The original Nerf Bow and Arrow could fire approximately 60 feet (18.3 m), while the new Rebelle Platinum model launches arrows up to 100 feet (30.5 m)!The drawing and firing action of a bow makes significantly less noise than regular guns, which often click loudly when they shoot.
Bow and arrow launchers make excellent choices for snipers.

, If all else fails, mow down the competition with one of Nerf’s patented weapons of mass destruction like the Vulcan EBF-25 or Rhino-Fire blaster. These guns feature high capacity loaders that hold up to 25 darts apiece and can even be mounted so that you can block off hallways and other strongholds with a torrent of merciless foam mayhem.Nerf machine guns can shoot at a rate of about one dart per second.
Because of their complex designs and the amount of ammunition they require, machine gun models tend to be more expensive.

, Add a little variety to your games by having everybody switch to a Nerf sword or battleaxe for close quarters combat. Nerf’s new line of melee weapons are molded from a single piece of soft, sturdy foam that safely allows players to bash each other to their heart’s content. They can be strapped to the player’s back and used in addition to or in place of pistols and other sidearms. Best of all, they never run out of ammo.Pair a sword with an assault weapon like the Demolisher to become unstoppable in ranged or hand-to-hand combat skirmishes.
Come up with your own rules for how swords and axes can be used in battle.

Look for deals in stores.,
Check the toy aisle.,
Look for necessary accessories.",How to Buy Nerf Gun Darts," There are three kinds of Nerf guns that take darts – Nerf Dart Tag blasters, Elite blasters, and N-Strike blasters. They each take a specific type of dart, so you’ll need to know which type of gun you have before you select darts.There should be a sticker on the side of your gun that says what kind it is.;
, All Dart Tag blasters take dart tag darts. Some Dart Tag blasters have clips and some don’t, but they all take the same kind of darts, so you can't go wrong as long as the package has the right name on it., Most Elite blasters take elite darts. However, the Centurion blaster takes MEGA whistler darts. Make sure you know which Elite blaster you have before you buy the darts.


All of the Elite blasters look pretty similar, except for the Centurion. The Centurion blaster is very thin and long and looks like a machine gun. It should also say ""Centurion"" on the side of it.

, The Nerf N-strike series uses a few different types of darts, depending on the type of gun you have. The darts for this series aren’t interchangeable like the Dart Tag or Elite blasters, so be very careful when selecting your darts. The name of the gun should be on the side of the gun, either on a sticker or etched in to the plastic.


The Stampede ECS, Raider Rapid FireCS-35 Blaster, and Longstrike CS-6 all take clip system darts.
The Barricade RV-10 and the Maverick Rev-6 take Whistler darts.
The Maverick uses suction darts.
The Nite-Finder X-3 uses glow-in-the-dark suction darts.
The Reflex IX-1 and the Jolt Blaster take Elite darts.

, Some Nerf guns use discs instead of darts. Those guns will usually have a drum that the discs go into, and you’ll notice that the drum is way too big for the darts. Don’t get darts if you need discs!, Different types of Nerf guns can take different amounts of ammo. If you can only load one dart at a time, you don’t need a huge pack of ammo. Overbuying your ammo increases the chances that you’ll lose it., Online retailers like eBay are a great option for buying new darts for your Nerf gun. You can filter your search by brand, the type of gun you have, or the darts you need. You can also use Nerf's official website, although if your gun has been discontinued, it might not be listed.Some online retailers might charge a shipping fee, so look for that information before you order online.

, Some toy stores will periodically have sales on Nerf gun ammo and accessories. If you don’t need ammo right away, waiting for a good deal can help you save a lot of money, especially if you have multiple types of Nerf guns., Most stores that sell Nerf products have the corresponding ammo stocked near each gun. Look on the shelves for the type of gun you have and check around it to see if the ammo is nearby. If it’s not, look for the particular ammo your gun takes.

, Depending on the Nerf gun you have, you might need a clip. Make sure your clip is in good working order before you buy new darts. If the clip is smashed or broken, your darts may not load properly."

",How to Build a Nerf Fort,"

How large you want your fort to be?



 


What facilities do you want? Your facilities will depend on how you fight. An ammunition dump can be useful, as can seats and electric lighting. If you can, try to build your fort near your nerf arsenal if you have one. If not, try to transport as many nerf guns as possible to your position






What will be the shape of your fort? A simple square is easy to build, while a system of bunkers is good for a strong defense.





;
, If you have an organized team, ask your team what they want, and make enough room for that.

Buy a Nerf gun, preferably a Maverick, because they work well in melee and are balanced and light.,
Practice shooting and aiming at larger targets, then moving on to the smaller ones.,
Assemble your full weapon arsenal.,
Create a gear pack, with 1 or 2 extra guns, easy-access bullets, water-bottles, some healthy food, spy-gear for indoor use, windbreaker, glasses, pocketknife, flashlight, gloves, hat, map of area, walkie-talkies, etc.",How to Become an Elite Nerf Soldier1," The Strongarm is an updated Maverick and shoots farther. The Recon CS-6/Retaliator works well in intimidation, and is easy to load and shoot. Or,the Alpha trooper, or Rampage works well. The Stryfe is a particularly well-rounded blaster (especially when modded) because of semi-auto firing and can be used as a primary or a sidearm. If you want full-auto firing, Look at the Rapidstrike or the Hyper-fire.
, It is important to be able to work the gun, as well as the ability to use it properly, and to your advantage! You can use just about anything as a target, such as chalk on fence, or using old archery or rifle targets!

, You will at least need a pistol (a Strongarm, Fire Strike, or Retaliator CS-12 with detached front barrel and stock, etc.), a rifle or two (Slingfire with a 25 round drum magazine or Retaliator CS-12,etc.), and a machine gun (Rampage Rapid Fire CS-25 or a Havok Fire EBF-25 etc.).

Train in aim first.,
Challenge yourself.,
Learn to shoot while running or doing an obstacle course.,
Train regularly.,
Have fun while perfecting your technique.,
Stay fit.,
Train yourself to become more agile and quiet, for these skills will help you in some sticky situations.",How to Become an Elite Nerf Soldier2," To do this, get familiar with your Nerf gun. Start with one first Nerf gun, and learn everything about it, knowing what direction it pulls to. Does it arc higher up or down?

, Use time trials to see how fast you can load, shoot, reload, etc.

, Do both separately first, then try them together, slowly.

, Practice your aim, stealth,shooting while running, and sniping, among other things. You'll be swiftly killed in a Nerf war if you know nothing about defense or shooting, so practice often.

, Unless you're enjoying yourself, it's not worth spending ages perfecting your skills. Inject lots of fun into the training and get to enjoy the feeling of hitting the desired target.

, Start by eating a healthy diet, with lots of vegetables and fruits. Sugars will make you crash and burn within 15 minutes, and you’ll likely to get a headache . Avoid eating too much of them. After you’ve gotten your diet working, concentrate on exercise. When in battle, you may need to sprint or run for a long period of time, such a 10-20 minutes! Practice on a treadmill, and doing as many push-ups and sit-ups and jumping-jacks as possible.

, Begin with jumping over PVC Pipe hurtles, climbing trees, rolling, etc., and progress into walking silently and stealthily. Once mastered, try doing some of these while holding, and, if possible, firing the gun!

"
"
Decide upon your role.",How to Become an Elite Nerf Soldier3," There are several different roles, including :


Melee Warriors, who use swords and axes in favor of blasters. They can take down enemies easily, but a well aimed shot is their downfall. They might carry a small sidearm.

Snipers, who use long-range rifles to shoot down enemies from behind cover.
Infantry, a warrior armed with a rifle and sidearm. These are the most numerous, and are well adapted to any situation.
Assassins, or spies. These can infiltrate the enemies base and quickly and silently take down an enemy or eavesdrop on their plans.
Scouts, who go ahead in the battle to try to see where the enemies are.

"
"
Construct a base.,
Build a Nerf capitol!,
Build “colonies”, of little bases to show territory, along with secondary and tertiary capitols!,
Make all capitols and bases with supplies and a map pinned-up, so you can mark territory, mark where bases and units are staged, and present a battle-plan.",How to Become an Elite Nerf Soldier4," This is an important place because you will store your Weaponry and Ammunition here. Make sure it is well defended, because if the enemy team gets to it, they will have a bounty of items to use.


One idea is, to have a reliable easy security system. During a Nerf War, have at least one person who guards the fort.
Another good plan is to have other little bases in the area, so if you main base is captured by the enemy, you can retreat to a smaller base to regroup your team and nerf guns

, This will be the main station for organizing campaigns, creating alliances, etc. If this falls to the enemy, you must have a secondary capitol, as well! Start with large cardboard boxes for indoors, and wood for outdoors! Also, cover cardboard with duct-tape to make it somewhat waterproof! Add a flag with a voted on sign, and a couple of windows with covers for rain and for ambushes! Add 2-4 cardboard boxes for turrets, with flags and holes for shooting.

, You may want to also add little turrets (outposts.) in areas to secure, either keeping them empty and camouflaged for emergency use, or stationing units in them! Most outposts should be small, inexpensive, and pretty easy for the enemy to overcome. They are mostly used as warnings, and as emergency posts for the wounded/for cover.

, It's important to have supplies on hand in just about every station (including outposts.), because in the event of a siege, you can hold out for a longer period of time, with ammo, food, drinks, etc. Having communication devices are handy, as well, so you can call for back-up, or supplies, instantly.

"
"
Assemble a team.,
Ensure that the team is reliable and that each member knows their roles and what they are good at.,
Form a strategy.,
Use team members sparingly.,
Use strategy when attacked.,
Be a role model for your team.,
Create camouflage for your squad, with uniforms and I.D.,
Research Nerf Tactics, and know how all your gear works.,
Make sure parents/guardians know about everything, and know where to find you.",How to Become an Elite Nerf Soldier5," An ideal team should consist of a strategist, soldier, medic, assassin, and a sniper. Assign these roles to people based on their weapons.


You can have more than one of each, because some battles require more people, and you may need to change out overworked warriors.

, You can train them yourself to fit your style of fighting,but at least consider their thoughts when they come to you. They may not be happy with their role or guns, so you have to listen to them.Your standard team should consist of as many people you can.This listing is assuming you have around ten people.


Have two-three Infantry.They are the backbone of your team.Their primary weapon should be either the Retaliator CS-12 or the Rapidstrike CS-18. They should preferably have the Strongarm as their sidearm.
Have two Snipers. They should be armed with a Retaliator with a Longstrike barrel and a bi-pod and perhaps a scope, and should be sniping from some sort of cover.
Have two Scouts. They should be armed with two handguns, preferably Hammershots for dual-wielding purposes. Scouts will go ahead on the battlefield to see what the enemy is doing.
You only need one Melee Warrior.They should be armed with the Nerf Warlock (a Battleaxe),the Nerf Marauder (a long sword),or Shadow Fury and Thunder Fury(twin swords).They might have a Firestrike as their sidearm.
A tank is good as a a battle opener or backup.You only need one Tank, but they should be equipped with heavy armor and at least three weapons.They will need a backpack or holster to carry it in. Good weapons are the Havok Fire EBF-25, Retaliator CS-12, Rampage CS-25, and/or the Strongarm.
The Assassin is the ultimate weapon in terms of hit-and-runs. They are good at stealth, and can spy,or infiltrate the enemy's base to silently take down an enemy warrior.

, Make plans on how you will attack the enemy. Try to take them off-guard, and use the environment to your advantage. For instance, if you are fighting in a meadow, it would not be a good idea to try a Pincher movement since you would be in plain sight fairly quickly.


Think about the possibilities, the outcomes, and the consequences, but don't overthink; you need to be able to act quickly, even if it could end badly.

, You should always have defenders at your base. If it is unguarded, as mentioned earlier, you will find your supplies depleted. A few can be scouts and try to find information about the enemy base.

, When it comes time to attack, make sure you stick to your strategy and that everyone is crystal clear on what to do. If there is a seed of doubt among your team, make sure that you clear it up.

, Be supportive and always have their back. This will make you the ideal team player.

, passes and other stuff for your squad! When using camouflage, try to use certain types for certain terrain; this will increase your invisibility. Uniforms are mostly used for meetings (without battling.), formations, and flat field battles (where there is no places to hide.). Uniforms are good because they act as identification of teammates and enemies. It's also pretty cool when all your friends are dressed in the same outfits; it's pretty intimidating, as well. I.D.'s are useful for basically just the fun of it.

, Plan out your stages of the battle, and ALWAYS have Plan A, B, C, and even D, in the event something goes terribly wrong.

, Safety always comes first, no matter what.

Practice a bit with your Nerf gun.",How to Become a Nerf Assassin or Hitman," In Assassin, each player receives an assignment on a card, or sometimes via text. That assignment will be the name of one other player in the Assassin game. The goal of the game is to eliminate that player, either directly or indirectly, with your Nerf gun.


Most games require a ""kill shot"" in which the dart hits the victim on the head or torso.
You're not allowed to defend yourself until you see another player actively trying to eliminate you.
Keep your assignment card with you at all times in the instance you need to prove your target to the referee.;
, You need a group of at least three people, along with an unbiased ""referee"" or organizer who can assign the hits, keep track of the score, and organize the game.


If you're joining a game already in progress, there might already be a set of rules already in place that the referee will make you aware of. Listen closely and play by the rules to have a good time. If you don't like the way a particular game is organized, start your own with your own specific set.

, Some games will play with a time limit of a hour or 10 minutes before all eliminated players ""respawn"" and the game can start over. It tends to create some sense of urgency to put a time limit on each round, but play the way you want. All games work differently, so you can customize the game to your particular interests.

, Often cafeterias and certain campus areas are considered off-limits and are to be treated as ""safe zones"" in which you can't be eliminated. Players who are employed will also typically include their workplace as an off-limits location.


It's typically against the rules to ""turtle"" and never emerge from out of the safe zones. It's no fun if you're never out in the open.

, Some Assassin games only allow players to be eliminated with kill-shots from the Nerf gun itself, while other games have expanded somewhat to allow for other types of indirect elimination, like poisoning, bombing, and other types of ""kills.""


Slipping a Nerf dart or piece of paper labelled ""poison"" is sometimes permissible, as is sending the person a Nerf dart to act as an ""explosive."" Indirect methods of play will vary somewhat.

, Some college campuses have outlawed Assassin after a series of misunderstandings and complaints. If you're going to be running around with Nerf guns shooting each other, make sure you're not going to get in trouble before you do. Clearing it up first will make sure everyone has a good time without worrying.


Most campuses won't allow games to take place during class time or in campus buildings. Use precaution and make sure you abide by their rules.
Let your neighbors know that your friends might be creeping around your house with Nerf guns so they won't call the cops on you.

, Typically, it's the job of the administrator to make everyone else aware of the eliminated players and it's the job of the eliminated player to let the referee know they're no longer in play. Typically games will last for several days at a time and might involve several rounds in which targets are switched or refigured.


In some games, once you've killed a player, you'll collect their hit card, giving you a new target. In games played in this way, the game continues until all players have been eliminated but one.

, Running headfirst at your target the first time you see them is a good way to get eliminated in defense. You need to play it cool and stalk your target for a while to learn their patterns and their hideouts. Be aware of the safe zones and figure out places in which you might lay in wait for your target.


Some games have special designations about witnesses. If you're playing under these kind of discreet rules, no one is allowed to see you eliminate another player without incurring penalties. Sometimes, too many witnesses might trigger eliminated players to be called back up with you as their target. Be aware of these rules and use discretion.

, What kind of a player is your target? Reckless? Conservative? Where do they live? Where would they hide? What will be your best possible way of finding them alone and taking them out? Once you start learning to think like your opponent, you're closer to victory.

, Typically, players will be overly cautious, but you might consider trying to strike up a faux-alliance and get close to another player, tracking them, staying on top of their movements and letting them lower their guard around you. Keep a lookout for a good opportunity to strike.


It might be tempting to employ other friends who aren't in on the game and try to get them to do your dirty work. Typically, this is illegal.

, Let opportunities reveal themselves rather than forcing your hand. Don't worry about jumping headfirst into firing all your bullets. Wait for the opportune moment and then strike. Learn to be aware as you go about your daily routines, keeping ready to move at a moment's notice. It keeps the game exciting and fun!

, Don't forget to play defense, too. Take different routes home and learn to stick close to the safety zones during play. Learn the other players' whereabouts during a particular day so you can avoid those areas and try to plot routes that will keep you safe.

, Obviously a Nerf gun is pretty critical, but dark clothing and knee pads/elbow pads and some leather gloves work great to get you into the spirit of things. What about binoculars and sunglasses? Why not? Popular varieties of Nerf guns include:


The Rapidstrike
The Centurion
The Elite Stryfe
The Vortex Diatron

, It helps to be able to run around a little bit, so you should be in shape and ready to move. If you can outrun your assassins, you'll be in good shape to come out on top.

, Even the super-expensive varieties aren't necessarily the most accurate toys out there. If you jump into the game without practicing, you're going to wait for the perfect opportunity to eliminate someone and misfire and end up out of the game and feeling dumb. Practice shooting at cans and other targets to get a sense of how your Nerf gun behaves.

Stick to your position.,
Start a Nerf war.",How to Choose a Position in a Nerf War," Are you a machine gun-toting heavy? Or a silent but deadly assassin? Play some less competitive games and find out which one you do best at.;
, Once you've played for a time, decide which positions you're likely to feel most effective playing in. Pick one of these roles:


Scout: Uses Nightfinder, runs around.
Sniper: Stays near base borders, uses Recon or Longstrike.
Rescuer: Runs in to enemy's bases to free hostages, uses a firefly.

, When you're experienced enough, upgrade to one of these roles:


Missionary: An upgraded scout, uses mavericks or recon (pistol only).
Gunner: Stays at in or around base, uses Vulcan or magstrike to wipe out enemies.
Raider: Runs in to enemies base, steals ammo. Uses raider.

, Once you've picked one, when you're even better, choose from one of these:


Agent: Highest level of scout, uses hyperfire, recon (pistol only) or longshot (front gun only).
Assassin: Highest level of sniper, uses longshot or modded rifle.
Ransom Payer: Highest level of rescuer. Uses anything that doesn't fire darts (titan is best).

, Make sure that you are comfort able using it and can shoot accurately with it. For example, a heavy might use the Stampede or Magstrike, while a commando might use the Alpha-Trooper or Deploy.

, It's less essential that this follows your role, as the secondary you shoot best with is probably better if you're caught reloading.


If you want to add a little bit of extra oomph, choose a special weapon for your position. A heavy might want a rocket launcher, while an assassin might want a small N-Force dagger for quick melee kills.
Have a secret strike with you at all times, no matter what position you play. This is useful for when you are out of ammo in all weapons, but you should only use for a last resort, as its one dart capacity and 7 pump firing action make it better for you to use something else if you can.

, If you're a sniper, then don't charge out like a madman, or vice versa if you're an assault trooper.

, Get to play now you know your position!

,
After you take a few shots, move to another position.,
Do not shoot your darts as far as you can.",How to Be a Nerf Sniper," In terms of shooting equipment, choose from among a Nerf or BuzzBee sniper rifle, a Rangefinder, LongShot CS-6, and a Nitefinder.


Good sniper rifles are Longshot CS-6 , Longstrike CS-6 , Mega Centurion , and the upcoming AccuStrike Raptorstrike. However, be wary that the Centurion's accuracy is below the expectations of a sniper.
Put foam on the piston hitter to silence the shot sound.;
, Bring a scope, too. However, good Nerf snipers don't use scopes, as they do not help you aim from long distances. A good scope to have would be the Day/Night Zoom Scope, which will be released in late 2017, as it actually magnifies your view up to 5 times, and it lets you see in the dark with its Night Mode.


Ensure that you have any other attachments needed for the rifle.
Have sufficient ammunition.

, Stay in shape; you might need to run from an enemy. You need a good sidearm in case you do not have time to reload or need to shoot with a fast fire rate.


Make sure you can use any gun and be good with it. You never know when you might need to be more than a sniper.

, If you own any ""Guitar Hero"" or ""Rock Band"" guitar, take off the strap! Put it on your gun by attaching it to the area near the trigger. This works best for the Longstrike CS-6.

, Nite Finders, Mavericks, and Elements are all welcome.

, Put the scope on first. A better alternative is the Retaliator CS-12 with a Longstrike barrel and a bi-pod and the Retaliator stock. Don't forget the scope! Use the smallest mags possible like 6-round mags.

, Never have it in the open. Have cover and concealment all around you. Choose a space that you can move easily in, yet stay hidden in.

,


Basically, where you can exit and enter the sniper post without blowing your cover or giving away your hiding spot. If you're found, don't shout. Enemies can find you easily, just use a backup that has more than a shot and doesn't jam a lot.
Cover and Concealment are Key

, Most snipers at the beginning of their sniper career think they are going to get the most kills on the battlefield. Wrong.They actually get the least. Being a sniper is not glorious. It's basically you laying on your belly in a bunch of weeds, holding a very long gun.

, Ask a few questions. Is it one person, or is it a group? What is the wind speed? What range are you firing at? Can you been seen? (The answer to that one should be NO!)

, Nerf darts are heavily affected by wind speed and direction. The wind will carry the dart over to the target if done right. The stronger the wind, the more it will be affected.

, A way to step quiet, is to step heel first, and then lower your foot down slowly.

, Once your breath reaches its natural pause, slowly take the shot.

, They will be looking for you. If you want to take out the entire group, move 6-12 feet away from your original firing spot. Then reload and shoot again.

, This technique is best done with the use of a spotter. In situations of limited personnel, the ""Turkey Neck"" technique may be used. Spotters tell you where your target is, male or female, approximate feet/yards your target is away, and the wind speed and direction.

, Always.

,,


Never stand in a corner for more than 3 shots. If you do, and you get found, you will get destroyed!

, The dart slows before reaching its farthest point. Instead, shoot about 70% of your guns max range, unless they would not see it coming.

, Avoid contact with anyone. If you see enemies, keep quiet and don't let them see you. Keeping your mouth shut is the secret to becoming an amazing spy. Travel through heavy vegetation and stay on the walls. If you hear people, duck for cover.

, A wall, large rock, or tree are all good spots. If you need to hear the enemy, a spot ten feet away is good. When going to your position, don't get seen!

, Take of your backpack, get a drink or snack, and rest. If you're burning in the sun, now is a good time to take off your sweatshirt.

, Pull out your binoculars and watch the enemy. Listen to your enemy and write down good information. Stick around unless you have to be back at a certain time. You never know what you might learn.

, When you are ready, exit your location quietly. Attack the base from the unguarded side (or less guarded). Then start shooting. Keep under cover. Once the enemy is out of darts burst in with a blade and have the base surrender. Grab the plans and get the heck out of there!

Make sure the location you select has the following features:The area should be clear of other people, especially young children.
Restrooms should be available nearby. Water fountains and places to buy food are optional, but recommended.
Cover for people to hide behind. Almost any location besides an open field will have this.;
, Most Nerf wars are played in public spaces, and you may arrive to find the location already in use. Plan around this in advance by looking for a backup location within walking distance.


Some public spaces can be reserved in advance through your local community center or school, but this is not always possible.
If both locations are occupied, politely ask the people present when they will be done. Don't pressure them into leaving, and don't begin the Nerf war until they have left.

, Plan the Nerf war at least three weeks in advance, especially if you are trying to recruit new people. Choose a time slot about four hours long if you are holding a typical nerf war. If you are recruiting more than twenty people or planning for a special occasion, you might plan a longer Nerf war, but eight hours is an exhausting upper limit.Remember to include meal breaks if necessary. Allow at least half an hour if people are bringing their own lunches, and at least an hour if people plan to eat at restaurants or hold a potluck picnic.
Pick a time to start wrapping up, at least fifteen minutes before the official end of the war. This lets everyone help gather darts and clean up together, and avoids irritating parents who don't want to wait around for this to happen.

, You can have a Nerf war with three or four players, but if you're doing all this planning in advance, you probably have a bigger event in mind. Start contacting your friends as far in advance as you can, and send out a reminder to people who haven't responded within a few days. If you'd like more players, you can try to recruit local players from the Nerf Internet Community, using websites such as NerfHaven or NerfHQ.


Be aware that Nerf players you find online may be used to a strict set of rules, and will often show up with modified Nerf guns and homemade ammo that can shoot farther and faster than regular Nerf darts.

, Once you have enough people, let them all know the rules you'll be using in advance. There are many different rules you can use in a nerf war, but the important part is to announce them in advance so everyone is playing by the same rules. Here are a couple common sets of rules you could use:""West Coast rules:"" Each player has five ""hit points."" When someone is hit, he loses one hit point. He then counts down from 20 slowly with his gun held up in the air. He may pick up ammo and walk around, but is not allowed to fire and cannot be hit during this time. He counts down the last five numbers loudly and says ""I'm in,"" and is then back in the game. He leaves the game permanently if he is down to zero hit points.
""East Coast rules:"" Each player has ten hit points, and loses one each time they are hit. There is no 20-second invulnerability period, but if several darts from the same automatic weapon hit you at the same time, this typically only counts as one hit. You leave the game once you are out of hit points.

, Eye protection is mandatory for every person present at a Nerf war. In addition, some Nerf weapons and ammo are often banned for safety reasons, or to make it fairer for all players. These vary from game to game, but here are some suggested rules to follow:


All homemade weighted darts must have a tip covering the weight.Nerf guns that can shoot 130 feet (40 meters) or farther are banned.
All ammo that contains sharp materials is banned, even if the point is hidden inside the ammo.
Melee weapons such as swords or clubs must be made out of Nerf foam. (In some games, even these are banned.)

, A Nerf war can last many hours, but usually one game doesn't take nearly that long to finish. Read about different Nerf games below, and choose at least two or three to play in case the players get bored of one type and want some excitement.


You don't need to figure out an order to play these in in advance. Sometimes it's best to see whether everyone is enjoying themselves, and suggest a switch to a new type of game once people seem bored.

, You don't need much structure to have a fun Nerf war. Pick one of the rules for getting hit described in the section above before the war starts. Divide the group into teams and separate onto opposite ends of the area before you begin the game. You can even have a free-for-all, with each player fighting every other player until one remains.


If you have a good sense of which players are better than others (or have better equipment), you can divide the group into two equal teams. Otherwise, make the teams at random, and switch the teams after each game.

, This is a popular Nerf game that is especially useful if you don't have enough weapons for everyone. Divide the group into two teams, the Humans and the Zombies. The Human team has Nerf weapons as usual, but the Zombies have no weapons at all. When a Zombie touches a Human, the Human becomes a Zombie. Zombies have ""hit points"" as usual and lose them when hit by Nerf darts.Use a bandana to easily identify team members. Humans wear bandannas on their arm, while Zombies tie it around their head.
Zombies are not allowed to use weapons even if they steal one.

, Each team keeps a flag (or any other recognizable object) near the ""base"" they start out in, but far enough away that it's difficult to defend from the base. The team that brings both flags back to its own flag station wins the game.Instead of using the usual rules you decided on, when you're hit, return to your base and count for 20 seconds before returning to the game.Consider a 20 minute time limit to avoid the game dragging on too long. Whichever team gets the enemy flag closest to its base by the end of the time limit wins.
For an alternative without flags, divide candy among the players. When a player is hit, they must drop any candy they are holding and return to base. Once one team has all the candy, it wins.

, The Defender team gets to choose a defensive position, often a play structure or an area of high ground with plenty of cover. If the Defender team survives for 10 minutes, it wins the game. If the Attacker team knocks all the Defenders out of the game before then, it wins.Optionally, you can have a Defender leave the fort and become an Attacker once he is hit three times. This may be a good idea if the Fort is especially easy to defend.

, This is a simple game of tag played with a single Nerf gun. When someone is hit, they take the Nerf gun. The last person to avoid getting hit by a nerf dart wins., If you have a large team, picking one player to be the leader can make everything go much more smoothly during the game. The leader decides when to attack, set up an ambush, or retreat, but he should listen to input from the other players.


You can switch the leader role between games, so everyone gets a chance at playing the leader. You may also want to have someone be second-in-command.

, Come up with a few simple code words or hand gestures with your team in advance, so you can talk about strategy without the other team catching on. Pick code words for ""attack,"" ""retreat,"" and ""set up an ambush.""

, If you have a long range weapon, you could pick a spot with cover and be a sniper for your team. A small, quiet weapon might be a good for a stealthy assassin. A fast-firing Nerf weapon with a large clip of ammunition is great for a straightforward assault, or to cover a team-mate's advance.


If possible, bring a Nerf pistol as a secondary weapon for emergencies, or for situations in which your primary weapon isn't useful.

, Whenever possible, move to a hill, play structure, or other high-up area. You'll be able to see farther and shoot at longer range. Try to stay behind cover if possible, or you will also be a more visible target.

, Choose a location with plenty of cover, such as trees or walls. Pretend to flee from an enemy, then disappear behind cover, turn around, and shoot when the enemy runs after you. This is even more effective if you have teammates lying in wait.

, Unmodified Nerf darts are very light, and easily blown to one side by the wind. Avoid shooting into strong wind, and practice adjusting your aim to make up for breezes., Keep stores of extra ammunition hidden in several caches around the area. Remember where these are so you can quickly retrieve extra Nerf darts when you run out.

Decide on the gun you want painted.,
Decide what parts of the gun you want painted.,
Choose your colors and design.,
Prepare your gun.,
The layout.,
Remove it from the cardboard box and get more tape, newspaper, paper-towels, and tissue: you're going to need it.

,
Plug your barrel.,
Cover the parts you don't want to paint completely with paper towel (don't tear holes in it) and masking tape.,
Lay your gun back on its cardboard box and prepare your paints and everything you will need nearby.,
Come back when you're sure its dry, and, taking a blade of grass, tap the painted parts of the gun in inconspicuous locations to see if its really dry.,
Repeat this process over and over.,
Leave it to dry for a few days.,
Remove the tape and, when removing the barrel tape, remove it from your gun, pointing down, so that dry paint doesn't fall into the inners of your gun.

",How to Paint Your Airsoft Gun," Not all airsoft guns look good painted. For example, G36s, MP5s, and other HK submachine guns generally looks their best in black. Some guns you might want to have painted are M16s, M4s, Sniper rifles, and SAWs.;
, Many designs are possible. For M4s and M16s and other variants of those weapons, the entire gun being painted is preferable, while as for SAWs and snipers, only plastic parts or ""furniture"" should be painted.

, (if you want digital camouflage... check the bottom under Tips) When at the store, make sure you are buying spray paints and that every single color you get is flat. If you get shiny, your gun will come out pretty darn badly...

, You want to prepare your gun so that it will not be harmed when you paint it. Do this after you have chosen a suitable place to paint. You will want to get masking or painting tape and lots of newspaper and place them on the ground making a ""table"" big enough for your gun and plenty of room for extra painting. Then get maybe a couple cardboard boxes or other strong, but recyclable thin constructs to lay your gun on during painting.

, After laying out plenty of newspaper and taping it down so that it won't move, get your cardboard box and turn it upside down, making sure that your gun can rest on it without wiggling. Then put on glasses, and prepare to make your gun beautiful!

,, Take tissue, and roll it (about two inches in height) and make sure you roll enough to get at least 4 mm once rolled. Place this in the barrel of your gun (make sure you have no battery, mag, or BBs in the gun. Also make sure you take off the sling, scope, and every other removable-without-screws part of your gun). Make sure, even if the tissue sticks out, that it won't fall out. Next take paper-towel and lay it over the mag-opening and tape it in place. Now cover any other holes in your gun (like on the M4, the open-ejection-port). Try to make it neat, because whatever is covered will not be painted, so in order to not have random streaks of paint-less gun present, you will only want to plug the holes.

, Don't use any other type of tape, as it may ruin your gun.

, Take your lightest color (ie: tan) that you will be using, and holding the can pointed down or at a downward angle at about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the gun, lightly spray your gun. Never hold you gun any closer. The coating should be light and may have patches untouched by the paint. If this is the case, DO NOT keep spraying in the same spot, NOR hold it closer. Just a really light coat for now. You can always come back and finish it. Spray the light color basically everywhere you want your gun to be painted, even if other colors will be added later. Now, depending on the weather, you will want to wait 20 minutes to 2 hours for the paint to completely dry. (if its hot and sunny outside, carefully take your gun outside, taking care not to touch any painted part, even if it looks dry, and leave it, with its box in the sun for about 20 minutes.)

, Now tap a more prominent area, and one that has more paint. If its dry, lightly tap it with your little finger. If it's not sticky, tap it just a little harder. If it's still not sticky, lightly rub your fingers over the painted parts. If they feel smooth, then its dry. If its sticky, wait just as long as you waited last time, or you will regret it later. If it is ready, carefully pick it up and take it back to the garage. Now take the same color and go over an missed spots using the same caution. Some parts may take up to 5 times to successfully paint before they look their best. Still do not hold the can closer than 8 inches (20.3 cm), nor hold it longer. If you hold it longer than 5 seconds on any part at one time, you probably ruined your gun.

, Once you finish the lighter colors, go to the darker ones, covering up the lighter ones as necessary. Never start another color until you have taken the steps in #10 to ensure its completely dry.

, Make sure its dry where you let it dry (ie: your room). DO NOT remove taped sections or the barrel plugs.

You have to be athletic, able to jump fast & high, run fast and be able to have accuracy while running, have fast reload time, have a gun such as the Maverick or Longshot, and a lot of darts.,

, Stealth is a key ingredient to a being a good assassin. Being able to climb, shoot, fight, reload and use other skills silently and without disturbing other people will help you greatly in a Nerf war. Silent walking is a lot better if you can take your shoes off. It may hurt a little, but its worth it if some thing's on the line.

, Traps are good for catching people for immediate termination. Stun traps are good for if you are waiting for someone. A balloon hidden under leaves makes them suspicious, then you can shoot them.

, Equipment is a vital part to a good assassin. Things such as stunners, throwing darts, and smoke bombs can be incredibly useful for saving your life. However, most of these item are not readily available. Stunners you can use when someone sees you. Throw one and run. Throwing darts for not having that Nerf gun shot unless you have the silence mod (very useful). Smoke bombs are useful for signaling people, or smoking someone out of a fort. The best Nerf gun for the job is the Jolt. It's tiny, shoots very far, and is very accurate.

, When your captors aren't looking, throw some smoke bombs to distract them and then run like heck.

, You might think that Nite-Finders are good, but they only hold one dart at a time, and have bad range and power unless you mod it. Secret shots you can conceal easily. The jolt is the best though. You can conceal it and it has good power.

,, This really only needs to be some chewable candy to ""revive"" someone. Have some water and band-aids etc. in your bag too in case someone actually gets hurt for real.

, A medic needs to be able to run to a downed teammate quickly, and then needs to be able to get out quick as well. Make sure you can move fast over and around obstacles.

, Because you'll be running 50% of the time as a medic, that means 50% of the darts that will be coming at you will be when you're running. If you can dodge darts when running this means sprints are less dangerous.

, Get a system down where you can revive them in under ten seconds. Having your pistol out while reviving also helps, so you can fend off enemies who want to take you down.

There may be some screws holding the gearbox down, if so you can remove them.
Remove the gearbox from the gun by lifting the gearbox and the motor (a cube like structure likely located in the pistol grip). Set them aside and move the body out of the way.;

An airsoft sniper is a player with the necessary skill and equipment to engage enemy players at range.,
The most necessary piece of equipment is the rifle itself.,
Different rifles provide different quality.,
Besides the rifle, buy camouflage clothing.,
Get some walkie-talkies or some other communication gear to relay info to your team.,
A BIG DEAL: BBs.,
PRACTICE!!!!!,
Be safe.,
Proper care of your equipment will prolong its life.,
This info should get newbies on the track to sniper greatness, and keep veterans on the path of awesomeness!",How to Choose an Airsoft Sniper Rifle," Most kids think that their ""Call of Duty"" sniping skills transfer to life. Sorry children, it doesn't. Sniping not only takes spotting and shooting skills, but to be a team-effective player, the sniper must be able to point out enemies to his teammates.The airsoft sniper must be cool-headed and tactically sound. However, the best soldier in the world ain't nothing without the proper equipment.;
, There is no need to purchase some $500 rifle when you can basically get something just as good for 1/3 the price. First figure out what rifle you want. There is pretty much an airsoft version of any rifle out there, like L96s, M40s, and .50 cals. Then research prices and manufacturers from multiple sites or stores. Good manufacturers include Well, UTG, and UHC. Then find the model you want and see if you can get it cheaper at different sites, and maybe get it with a package deal.

, Try to avoid anything under $100. Most good rifles range between $100 and $200. These are usually the basic spring sniper rifles, usually bolt-actions. Going above $200 is when you begin to hit the gas-powered rifles and licensed rifles. If you have the cash, go for it. If not, like me, stick within your price range.

, You're a sniper, REMAIN HIDDEN! But that doesn't mean you have to buy a ghillie suit (though most people recommend it). Face paint is also a good option, though most find it easier to just wear a shemagh or a ski-mask.

, A well coordinated team will stand a better chance than a scattered, misinformed unit.

, NEVER buy the crappy BBs from places like Walmart or Dick's. Try to buy competition-grade BBs. Goldenball Proslick work wonders. If you think its stupid to buy BBs off the internet and wait for them, then think how stupid you'll feel when that new rifle's internals smash and burn. Besides, you can usually buy the quality BBs from airsoft stores. Look for SEAMLESS, WELL-MADE ammo( Elite Force, King Arms, Madbull, Matrix).They should be free of imperfections like dimples, cracks, and seams. Make sure those BBs work with your rifle. For snipers, I recommend .25s or heavier, as a heavier BB will be more accurate. A lighter BB (less than 23) grants more range but less accuracy., main your shots will curve dramatically over distance. Try to stay away from anything lighter than 23.

, Learn the limits of your rifle and ammo. If you can go through a can at 50 yards (45.7 m), you're set. Make sure your scope is in tune with the gun. Zero it properly and you'll have no problem scoping out your friend's face.

, Too many times has some idiot been acting a fool and ended up bleeding. Wear proper face and body protection, and try not to play with someone who refuses to don eyewear. Also, high-powered rifles can cause injury if improperly handled. Use a barrel sleeve if you have one and keep your gun on safety when not in use.

, Clean after a long day of play and periodically. Keep your BBs clean too. One of the best ways to prolong the life of rifle parts is to clean and use proper ammo.

, Remember, a soldier could be comfortable with being gunned down in a hail of bullets, but most are uneasy about the thought of a lone marksman singling them out with a shot to the head!

"
"
Keep your gun clean.,
If there is a hammer in its mechanism that strikes a metal plate at the end of its movement, a small piece of thin sound-absorbing material, such as plastic, mounted on the plate will reduce this sound.

,
Repeating this action throughout the gun's firing mechanism will reduce the mechanical noise of your weapon.

",How to Make a BB Gun Silencer1,";
,,"
"
You must calculate how much air expands in your gun's firing chamber.,
To lessen the concussive blast to lessen sound, substitute an open ended egg carton taped to the barrel for the pipe.,
If you want to get some steel wool and line the inside of the pipe or bottle with it, the steel wool will absorb the sound a little better.",How to Make a BB Gun Silencer2," The silencer you build must have enough internal area to contain this volume of air.


In broad terms you must construct a can that mounts to the end of the gun that is closed on both ends. Inside the can there are several baffles. Through both ends and each baffle there must be a hole opened that allows the projectile to pass through. The hole should be a little bigger than the projectile to allow the projectile to pass through the ends and the baffles without touching the sides of the holes. The holes must also be exactly in a straight line, otherwise the projectile may strike the sides of one or more of the holes which will affect its trajectory.






Get a BB gun, preferably a rifle-like one. (It is possible to try this with a BB pistol, but it's a lot more difficult.)






Get a long (1 to 2 feet) pipe with a large enough diameter to fit over the front sights.






Fit the pipe over the front sights, so that is not at an angle that would prevent the BB from exiting the gun as it should. Optional: Use tape to secure the pipe.






Load and fire the BB gun. You should hear a low-pitched ""thump"" instead of the usual ""pop"".






Try different types and lengths of pipe.







, It possesses greater sound absorbing qualities and won't obscure the sights of the BB gun.

, Your BBs might hit it though if the suppressor isn't on straight."
"
Look at the cost.,
Keep in mind the type of play you will be doing: CQB, sniping, support gunner, or just covering fire.,
Consider popular models.,
Don't dismiss the less popular options, though.,
Think about weight.,
Factor in your play style.,
Review performance.",How to Choose an Airsoft Gun," Make sure you have a firm idea of what you want to spend before you start looking for the perfect gun. Your price range should also be based on not only how much you have available to spend, but how involved you want to get. There's no point in dropping hundreds of dollars on a professional guns if you are new to the sport. Start of with a cheap gun so that if you will break it you won't miss too much and then gradually work your way up depending on your involvement and how much money you got.;
, Make sure you are suitable for the role (e.g. if you are not patient than there is no point of you becoming a sniper). After you choose your role then pick a gun suitable for it. CQB (or Close Quarters Battle) guns are fairly short to make it easier popping in and out of the corners. Snipers usually use heavy, expensive but very powerful bolt action sniper rifles. Support gunners are equipped with extremely heavy but hard hitting light machine guns (for example M60s). For covering fire, any assault rifle with a high capacity magazine should work.


$0 - $100 or £0 - £60  : If you don't have at least $100 to spend on a new gun, you should keep saving. DO NOT buy a random Chinese LPEG (Low Powered Electric Gun). You may be thinking, ""Hey, cool, a $20 gun! I'm gonna have loads of fun shooting at things in the backyard!"" The reality is that you will spend about 10 minutes shooting things in your yard and then realize that you just wasted $20+ dollars on a piece of junk. Electric guns within that price usually have a plastic gearbox, which breaks very easily. Do not buy a gun with plastic gearbox inside if you want to go further than just garden battles.
$100 - $160 or £60 to £100  : This price range contains most of your entry level guns. The primary manufacturers in this price range are Echo 1, Classic Army Sportline, and G&G Affordable Series. As long as you stick with these 4 manufacturers, you really can't go wrong. The style of gun you choose should be based on personal preference. If you really want a G36 but your friends are telling you to get an M4, GET THE G36! It's your gun after all, and you should be happy with what you buy. When you buy a gun it is always a good idea to check possible upgrades for it. G36s aren't as popular as M4 Series and don't have as wide range of upgrades. (see ""How to Airsoft on a Low Budget"")!
$160 - $200 or £100 to £120 : This price range contains upgraded/ metal body versions of the entry level guns from the same manufacturers. Upgraded gearbox guns have a great quality inside but still have that low quality outside body. However if you know how to treat a gun and you will treat it well than metal gearbox upgraded guns are a good step to start out professional airsoft for first couple of matches. If you wish to avoid this area consider saving for a high end gun or spending the extra money on BDU's or other gear.
$200 - $250 or £120 to £155 : This is a problematic price range to be in if you plan to go fully professional. Many clone manufacturers, most notably A&K, market specialized guns in this area such as SR-25s and custom M4/M16s. Although the metal bodies are enticing at this relatively low price point, the internals could best be described as a steaming pile of... you know. The one exception is the Classic Army MP5s. If you are looking for an MP5 and this is your price range, they are definitely a solid investment.
$250 - $300 or £155 to £180 : Welcome to the promised land! This price range is the start of the true high end models. Most of the guns you will find in this range are Classic Army M4/M16s. You really can't go wrong with a Classic Army, and most people choose an M4/M16 variant. This is a great kick off point if you plan to go professional and in fact most professionals often stick to this price range.
$300 or £200+ : This is where the floodgates really open. Classic Army, Tokyo Marui, G&G, KWA, and ICS are all excellent manufacturers. This price range really is all about personal preference. Note that Tokyo Marui bodies ARE plastic, although the internals are excellent. Once again, you really can't go wrong if you buy from one of these manufacturers, and your choice should be based on personal preference.

, As mentioned before, select your model based on YOUR preference, not what other people tell you. Here is a quick rundown of what to expect from most models.

M4 and M16 Series - Most popular gun series in airsoft. There is a huge range of both external upgrades (such as scopes or hand grips) and internal upgrades for this type of rifle. If you wish to attach the scope to the gun from those series make sure it has 20mm wide rail, and then you're all set and the rest is up to your preference. Because of the high competition for great M4 AEGs, this category will have the most perks because of the constant company competition, but as said earlier pick the AEG model you want most. Also, if you wish to use these guns for CQB then avoid long barrels, as most of these guns have long ones.






MP5 - Another popular gun. Not quite as many options for external upgrades as M4/M16's, but plenty of internal upgrades available. These really shine in CQB, where the small size makes a big difference.






AK-47/ AK-74 - Many different body styles to choose from, ranging from a basic AK-47 to a compact AK-74u. Once again, not as many external modifications as M4/M16's, but plenty of internal upgrades. This is probably the secondly bought airsoft model on the planet.






G36 - Not quite as popular as the previously mentioned guns, but still a great choice. One big advantage is the availability of magazine well adapters. These can be a god send since G36 magazines aren't as widely available as other types.







, Here are a few models that are less popular:

G3 - Very few external modifications, although still heavily upgradable internally. They tend to cost a lot of cash and have electric blowbacks.






P90 - Decent number of external upgrades, and somewhat limited internal upgrades.






SIG 550/552 - Fairly limited external modification, heavy internal upgrade potential.






LMG's (') - Limited external modifications, lots of internal upgrades available.






Base your choice around what YOU prefer rather than what anyone else says. If you feel more comfortable with an MP5 than with an M16A4, go with the MP5!
You might also want to consider the layout of the gun. There are two main layouts of airsoft guns (and real guns for that matter), regular, and bullpup. Bullpup guns have the magazine behind the trigger, so that the gun can be a bit shorter overall, yet keep a ridiculously long barrel. Because of this, bullpup guns can be easily used as snipers, field guns, and CQB guns all at once.

, Here is one situation where it isn't recommended going with what your personal preference is- LMG's (i.e M249, M60, RPD/ RPK, etc). Although you might think it would be cool to run around shooting at people with a weapon like this, the weight of these guns is simply too much for most players to use effectively. If you have the upper body strength to carry one of these around for long periods of time, by all means go for it. However, make sure you consider the weight before purchasing one.

, Consider the type of play you will be doing when you choose your airsoft gun. There are two main types of games in airsoft- CQB (close-quarters battle) and field. If you might want to be playing CQB, you should consider getting a gun with a shorter barrel or a folding stock. If you are playing field, you might want a gun with a much longer barrel, as this will be more accurate. It is definitely possible to take a long gun into a CQB game, but it will be easier for the player if the gun is shorter. Also, it is very possible and very easy to take a shorter gun to a field game, but you will have to get close to your enemy for the shots to be effectively accurate. There are two bigger branches of the game above CQB and field, Casual and Milsim. Casual play is essentially the grown up form of backyard airsoft. Although no one is running around a backyard, the atmosphere is generally pretty relaxed, and there are no major restrictions on gear. Milsim, on the other hand, is much more restrictive in terms of gear. Most milsim events will not allow high capacity magazines to be used unless they are used with a weapon that would normally have a high capacity (i.e LMG's). They also require realistic gear such as proper camouflage (teams in both casual and milsim play are often assigned based on camouflage type).

, There are 3 types of airsoft guns, and they all perform a little differently:


Gas/ Gas Blowback- This style of gun will most likely use green gas or co2 cartridges, These guns have a realistic recoil to it, basically every shot you shoot , the gun will recoil like a real gun would but not as much. Most gas guns are pistols, but there are many gas rifles and smg's.






Spring- These guns require no batteries or gas. Most spring guns are pistols or sniper rifles. You will have to pull the cocking mechanism back before every shot because the spring is the only propellant. If you plan to go professional the only Spring gun you might want to use is Sniper Rifle.






AEG/AEP- These guns operate by using gears to pull the spring. Those gears are ran by electric batteries, which when are out you have to recharge. The most common battery is an 8.4v. AEGs are the most common Airsoft guns to find, and are also some of the highest quality and variety. Most beginners should get AEGs (automatic electric guns/pistols), as they are reliable and upgradeable when compared to GBBs (gas blowbacks). Some AEGs will have a blowback just like GBBs however the AEGs that have one are very expensive.

For the pen and mechanical pencils, cheap, simple brands like Bic will work well.;

Remove the cap from the pen, then unscrew the part of the pen that holds the ink from the outer plastic tube.






After you have done this, cut the closed end of the outer plastic tube so that you have a single tube with holes at both ends.







,

Remove the grip from the mechanical pencil, and, if possible, unscrew the top (the part where the lead comes out). (You may need to cut this part off if it cannot be unscrewed.)






Remove the eraser from the other end of the pencil and take out any lead that is inside.






The mechanical pencil is made up of 2 parts, the outer tube that you hold onto and the inner part that is made up the eraser holder and the thin inner tube that holds the lead. Cut the end of the outer tube so that you can remove the inner part (eraser holder and lead holder). This is the part that you will need.






You should now have only 2 components: the outer tube of the pen, and the inner part of the mechanical pencil (with the eraser holder, but without the eraser).







, Use the scissors to cut 2 notches in the circular part of the pencil that usually holds the eraser. The notches should be located directly on opposite sides of the eraser holder. It should look more or less like this: ( ), where the gaps between the parentheses represent the notches that you have cut, and the parentheses represent the uncut plastic. This is the part that will hold the rubber band(s) in place later.


At this time, you can also remove the plastic clip that is connected to the eraser holder. This is the part that would be on the outside of your breast pocket if you carried your pencil there.

, Slide the lead/eraser holder from the pencil into the pen tube. You want the eraser holder to remain outside the pen tube. If the pencil part is too thin, it may slide all the way into the pen tube. If this is the case, wrap tape around the pencil tube just below the eraser holder so that it is thick enough that it cannot fit through the opening in the pen tube. Now, when you slide the tube over the pencil part, the eraser holder will not slide into the pen tube, nor will the part that you have made thicker with tape. Thus, there will be a few centimeters of the pencil tube that remain outside the pen tube. This is the part that you will pull back to fire the gun.

, Slip the rubber band into the notches in the eraser holder that you cut earlier. Stretch the rubber band about 3/4 of the length down the pen tube toward the open end. Twist the rubber band a few times around the pen tube, and attach it with tape.

Note: When you twist the rubber band around the tube, do not just wrap both sides of the rubber band around it, or else the rubber band will come unraveled. Rather, wrap one side of the rubber around so that the pen is actually inside the rubber band. Wrap this same side a couple of times, and then wrap both sides tightly around the whole tube.






Note: You can add more rubber bands for greater power. Follow the same method for wrapping subsequent rubber bands.







, After taping the rubber band(s) onto the tube, you should now be able to pull back on the eraser holder to cock your new BB gun. When you release, the pencil tube should shoot partially through the pen tube, but the tape should stop it from going completely into the tube. Now you can find ammo for your gun. You will need to find round objects that will fit into the space at the end of the pen tube that it created when you pull back on the eraser holder.

, You can now fire your weapon, but remember to be careful and not to aim at anyone's eyes.

On the left side of your gun look for the notch that releases the slide.,
On the slide itself you'll see two notches on the left side of the slide.,
On the barrel at the very front of the gun is something called a ""bushing"".,
Carefully slide the slide forward it should come right off.,
Use a silicon lubricant, preferably sprayed, around the parts you have dissembled.,
Take a q-tip and rustle the ends with your fingers until it's really fluffy.,
Time to reassemble.,
Insert the spring into the bottom of the barrel.,
Carefully slide the slide back into the handle.,
Almost done.",How to Field Strip and Clean a M1911A1 Airsoft Pistol," It is located about halfway down the slide and is the same one you press on to release the slide after loading in a new clip.;
, Maneuver the smaller notch with the slide release, then push on the slide release on the right side of the pistol. It should slide out nice and easy.

, It is a plastic thing that has a horseshoe shaped bottom with another circular piece of plastic is it holding in. Push on that lower plastic piece and your spring should contract a bit. This allows you to slide the bushing to the left or right. It will come out. The spring will then push itself out of the gun along with that plastic piece you just pushed down on. Take them and the barrel bushing out.

, The actual barrel of the gun can (and should) be carefully pulled back and down for cleaning. Congrats, it's field stripped! Time to clean and oil.

, Even parts you might not think of like the spring should be oiled. Make sure any dirt and debris are out. Use a compressed air keyboard cleaner or q-tips to do this. If using a silicon lube you can spray, spray into the trigger components on the inside of your gun's handle.

, Insert into the barrel and push it through with a second q-tip to clean it. Repeat until q-tip is no longer dirty.

, Place barrel up and through the slide, making sure the back of it is correctly in a pin located on the back of the slide.

, Insert it's plastic cylinder at the end of the spring. Remember the bushing? Insert it above that cylinder piece and then make sure the horseshoe shaped bottom part is over the cylinder. The spring and slide should hold together and thus the slide is fully reassembled.

, At the back of the gun are two triangular very small notches to hold in the slide. You may need to press them down and slowly slide the slide over them.

, Line up the slide release piece (should be the last piece left and the first you removed) and make sure it lines up on the left to the back notch on the slide. It should slide in nice and easy. Dry fire or shoot off a magazine to make sure everything's working properly...You're done!

Follow through.",How to Aim a BB Gun," Understanding the name and function of each part is essential in maintaining control over your gun at all times.;
, This helps you aim with precision and tells you which side to hold the gun on (if applicable).


Extend both arms in front of you.
Make a small circle with the index fingers and thumbs of both hands.
Looking through the circle, focus on a distant object.
Draw the circle back towards you, still focusing on the object.
The eye in line with the circle is the dominant eye.
If you are shooting an air rifle, the gun should rest on the same side as your dominant eye.

, Breathing - or, rather, not breathing - is an important element in aiming your gun. The movement of the body as it breathes makes it difficult to get a good sight picture, much less shoot straight.


Breath and relax the body before aiming.
Take a deep breath and exhale halfway.
Hold your breath halfway exhaled as you aim and squeeze the trigger, then exhale.
You can practice this technique without your gun to get used to it., Stand with your knees straight, feet shoulder-width apart, and your body and head erect. Your left arm supports the rifle by resting against your rib cage. The rifle butt rests against your right shoulder. Your left hand supports the weight of the rifle from under the fore-end and the right holds the grip.


To adjust your aim left or right from this position, move your feet. To correct aim up or down, raise or lower the gun.

, Lie on the ground facing your target, angling your body a bit to the left. Your right knee bends slightly, drawing the right leg up but keeping it parallel with your back and your foot on the ground. Extend your left arm forward, supporting the fore-end of the gun from underneath with your left hand. The rifle butt should rest against your right shoulder as your right hand holds the grip.


To adjust aim left or right, pivot your body on the left elbow; to correct aim up or down, move your left hand backward or forward, respectively.

, Kneel on your right knee with your foot centered under your buttocks. Your weight is on the bottom of your right heel, with your toes flat on the ground. Your left leg is drawn up in front of you, knee bent, foot flat on the ground. Position the flat part of your left elbow onto the flat part of the left kneecap. The fore-end of the rifle rests in the palm of your left hand.


Aim by pivoting your body on your right foot and adjusting your left foot for balance.

, Sit cross-legged and rest your elbows on your legs just behind the knees. Hold the rifle fore-end in your left hand and put your right hand on the grip.


Aim left or right by pivoting the body from the waist, and up and down by adjusting your left elbow's position., The backstop is the background to your target. Avoid hard surfaces, water, tin cans, or other hard objects that might result in a ricochet.

, There should be no one and nothing in the immediate vicinity of your target.

, Always remember to aim the gun in a safe direction so that if it were to go off it would not cause injury or damage.


Keep your index finger off the trigger (resting along the side) and hold the gun with both hands.
Bring the gun to eye level.

, This is either a horizontal bar with a notch in it (open rear sight) or a hole (aperture).


Do not keep your eye too close to the backside of the aim as it may damage your eye.

, Front sights are either a small post or another aperture. When the front and rear sights are aligned, the front is centered in relation to the rear.

, Now you should have all three things aligned, with the front sight and target centered in relation to the rear sight.

, Be absolutely certain that you know what your target is, and what's beyond it.

, Relax your body, take a deep breath, exhale halfway, and hold.

, Always think before you shoot.

, Do not jerk or pull it.

, After you fire, you should not move until you have hit your target. It takes just a split second for the pellet to leave the gun, but even in this short amount of time any movement will interrupt your aim.


Exhale fully only after your target is hit."

What makes a special operations squad different then any other is tactics and how they fight.,
Stay as quiet as possible.,
After you have successfully flanked your enemy, lay down fire on them.,
After taking out the enemies, keep on the enemies flank or link up with the main force and finish the assault.

",How to Be an Airsoft Special Operations Soldier1," In order to play this role, you will want to learn the environment and flank the enemy. You should not be near the main force but be flanking the sides.. Typically you will want cover like in the woods along a creek. You will want to stay out of open areas. After you have looked over your map (obtaining a map is easy, look at the field's website to see if they offer one or type in the location on Google Earth and print out the satellite view), you will want to get a few people in your squad (3-5 people will be good). If you have your own squad then that is even better.;
, Watch your footsteps, communications, and after every 5-10 steps stop and scan for enemies. Constantly be aware of your surrounding so you know what cover to go to in case of an ambush.

, If you have any type of communication with main force (through radio, phone, etc), let them know the position your about to assault so they do not fire upon you.

,"
"
After you have some experience, consider getting a squad together for training and airsoft play.,
Practice with your squad.,
CQC tactics.,
Use military language and call-signs.,
Take your time.",How to Be an Airsoft Special Operations Soldier2," Having a squad will help you out greatly. Below are tactics.

, Learn formations, spreads, and rules of engagement. Also, learn how to engage as a squad and also defensive tactics. A special operations squad should have a killing power far beyond it's physical size. Defending against a large group is difficult. One way you can defeat a large squad is by breaking contact and flanking. Your squad only has enough for a good 10 minutes of engagement before they are out of ammo. Be aware of this. In order to defeat a force larger then you, you have to keep calm and keep the fire on high. Listen to the amount of fire that your squad is receiving and the moment you hear that the fire is lowering, tell your squad  to do a center split. The goal is to break contact. One person will suppress the enemy as the rest of the squad falls back. After that person has suppressed the enemy for about 10 seconds, he will fall back and has he passes one of his squad mates, that squad mate will do what he did. Keep repeating this process until you have broken contact. Once that is achieved, you can ambush them and flank them. At this point you will want to kill them as fast as possible and progress as fast as possible to give them little time to form a line of defense.

, Always have your squad ready to go. When stacking up, have them squeeze each others shoulder starting from the last in line to the point man. This ensures that everyone is ready and that the point man doesn't walk into a room alone.

, Even better is to make up your own phrases for when your moving, when you tell your team to engage, etc. this will ensure that no enemy knows what you're doing if they happen to eves drop on you or your radio conversation. Use hand signals as much a possible and if you have to speak, make your phrases short. Before going to the field, ensure everyone knows the phrases so everyone knows what to do

, As they say in the SEALs: don't run to your death. Go slow and move silently. No point of rushing. Keep the element of surprise until the last minute. Don't flash bang through every door and yell everything your saying. Keep it silent. This not only prevents your squad from being compromised, but it also keeps the stress level down and allows your squad to perform a lot better.

"
"
After every single game, adapt your tactics.",How to Be an Airsoft Special Operations Soldier3," Learn from your mistakes and see why you got killed and alter that tactic to prevent that from happening again. Always learn and adapt. That is not only how you keep your casualties on low but it also allows you to be a lot more effective as a spec-ops squad.

,

Wear shorts.,
Wear a mouth guard.,
Use your goalie items if a goalie.",How to Dress for Soccer," The most important part of dressing up for soccer is to give yourself freedom of movement so that you can play without having to think about your clothes too much. Since recreational play doesn't tend to involve uniform requirements, you don't have to worry about the same limitations you might for official or league play.;
, If you are just playing with your friends, you can wear whatever you want as long as it is comfortable. So, if it is hot outside, go with something cool, while if it is cold, pick something a little bit warmer (but keep in mind that you will get hot when you start running around).

, If it is warm outside, you should probably choose shorts and a t-shirt or soccer jersey. If it is colder, you can choose sweatpants and a long-sleeve shirt. You may or may not need to wear shin-guards. If you do, wear short socks underneath the shin-guards and long socks over them to keep them in place.


Layer if necessary. If it is cold to start out, make sure that you wear shorts under your sweatpants so that you can take them off if you get too hot. You can also wear a t-shirt underneath your long-sleeve or sweatshirt for the same purpose.

, Again, the most important things are comfort and functionality. If you own cleats, you can wear those. However, many recreational soccer games can be played in tennis shoes or running shoes, or with no shoes at all. Check with your fellow players to decide what kind of shoe is appropriate for that particular game. Because Soccer requires kicking a ball, you should wear tennis shoes or cleats, you can damage and hurt your feet by wearing sandals or going barefoot.

, You can spice up your outfit by purchasing the jersey or shorts of a favorite player or team. It can also be fun to wear headbands or other accessories to make you feel like the famous players you see on TV, as well as keep your hair out the way.

, When playing for a team or in a league, be aware that there may be stricter dress requirements than for recreational games. Know the rules so you can stay within policy.

,,,


Turf shoes are acceptable only when on playing on turf.
Cleats cannot have metal spikes, front toe spikes, or anything that may hurt another player.

,


This makes it easier to see in the game.
You can use skinny and soft headbands to hold your hair from falling in your face.

,


Jackets and warm-up shirts cannot be worn over your team shirt because it hides what team you are on, and is considered cheating.
Zipper-less jackets, sweatshirts (with hood down) can be worn under your shirt.
All types and colours of under shirts are considered acceptable as long as it is worn under your shirt.

,


Leggings to go under your shorts are acceptable.
Goalies are allowed to wear pants.

,


This is particularly encouraged if you have braces or any other condition with your teeth.
Gel ones are great.

,


You are going to need a good pair of gloves.
Wear a different color shirt.

Heel to Heel.",How to Dribble a Soccer Ball Past an Opponent," For this move, the key is simply a change of pace. Jog slowly with the ball almost to the point of stopping. Usually it is best to do this as a defender is alongside of you and suddenly as you are jogging, burst past the defender. You can magnify the effect if you also put the sole of your foot on top of the ball for a second when you stop the ball, and then push it forward with your instep when you break off to perform the ""Fake Shot"". Look up and towards what would be your target. Bring your leg back as though you are going to shoot to freeze the defense. Draw your leg back as though you are going to make a pass or take a shot, and then stop this motion just in front of the ball. You can then move the ball to the left or right to set up for your next play, since the defender thought you were going to shoot.;
, Cut the ball back behind your body with the inside of your foot. Plant your left foot to the side of the ball. Then bring your right foot up to cut the ball back. Do the reverse if you are cutting the ball back with your left foot.


You can often tie this in with a fake shot. Dribble into an open space and fake a pass or shot, and then chop the ball back with the inside of the foot you used to fake the pass or the shot. Dribble off in the other direction at speed.






Start by dribbling the ball forward and plant your right foot near the ball as your left leg reverse for a big kick or shot. However, instead of shooting, bring the right foot down and ""chop"" the ball backwards and underneath your left leg.







, Swing your right foot over the ball in an outward motion and take the ball with the outside of your left foot. The steps of the move are the same, but in reverse if you are doing this move with your other foot.

, Bring your right foot around and over the top of the ball to the inside and plant your foot on the ground. While your foot is on the ground, kick the ball with the outside of your foot to the right. Always remember to accelerate after doing a move. This move is most often done while in a standing position. Do the reverse for your left foot. To perform the trick faster, do foot drills as in jogging backwards and dragging the ball backwards with you or jogging forward and tapping the ball in front of you. Try to keep the ball close to you.

, If the defender doesn't go for the first ""step over"", you can try this move. Take your right foot over the ball, and then swing your left foot over the ball. Take the ball away with the outside of your right foot - it's two swinging motions of each foot over the ball - and then break off at speed.

, Fake like you're going inside and then rush to the outside. With the inside of your foot on the ball, carry the ball a little bit to the inside a few steps (leaning in the direction you want the defender to think you are going). When the defender is off balance or not ready, push the ball to the outside with the outside of your foot, and dribble away at speed. Again, change of pace is key to all dribbling moves.

, Use the outside of your foot. This is usually more difficult because you don't have as much control with the outside of your feet in terms of surface area, so make the dragging of the ball to the outside a shorter distance. Push the ball to the outside a few touches and then break to the inside with the ball on the inside of your foot.

, Dribble directly at a defender and feint with the shoulder in one direction and dribble away in the other direction. You are ducking or leaning your shoulder down a little bit one way and taking off the other way. Thus the reason for calling this the ""Dropping your Shoulder"" technique. Remember to touch the ball with each step as you move towards the defender so that the ball is close to you and easier to control and touch to one side or the other. If you are dribbling the ball with your right foot, then you are going to fake with your right shoulder. Touch the ball to the left foot just after you drop your shoulder fake.

, Dribble straight ahead with the right foot and then pull the ball back with the bottom of your right foot, bursting away in the opposite direction with a change of pace.

, Tempt the defender into diving for the ball, and lift the ball over the defender's foot just as he or she dives in. This is usually done while feinting one way and then scooping the ball the other way, just over the defender's planted foot. Make sure to take off with a burst of speed after you lift the ball over the defender's foot. Often, you'll want to scoop or lift the ball over the defender's foot onto your other foot, so that your body will be between you and the defender after you make the move. Have the ball on your right foot and scoop it over the defender's foot to your left foot. Your body is then between the ball and the defender. This move is usually done when you're in an almost-standing position, and the defender is rushing at you, or you're suckering the defender in and then lifting the ball over his or her foot as he or she comes towards you too fast.

, Lean to one side and carry the ball with you as if you are going to dart off with it. When the defender doesn't expect it, take off in the opposite direction that you are leaning towards. This move is also usually done when you are in a standing position, trying to beat a defender to get a cross or shot off for instance. If you can't manage to achieve this, then just practice harder.

, Entice the defender to try to go for the ball, exposing the ball as if the defender can steal it, and when he or she makes a move to go for it, you cut the ball away and take off. Again, change of pace is the key when beating a defender on the dribble. This is why, when training, you touch the ball each time you dribble, so that you can gain greater control of the ball and make those sharp cuts to the side or back and entice, elude, frustrate, and really annoy defenders.

, While dribbling, step over the ball with your right foot, and when the defender leans that way, hit the ball with your left foot. It will ""Step over Nutmeg"" the defender every time.

, Take a small quick touch to the right, and then touch it through the defender's now-open legs or around him or her, and run onto it to do a ""Fakie"".

, When you are in a jam with a defender in front of you, try this move. Take a hard half step to the right side of the ball with your right foot. You want your opponent to stab to your right side. Pull the ball back with the sole of your right foot, when it is past your left foot, tap it across the back of your left foot and if possible, tap it forward. When done fast, this move works very well.

, Drag the ball with your right leg toward your left leg and do a step over with your left leg and explode to the left. Do this smoothly and the defender will shift his or her weight to the opposite direction.

, Begin by taking a touch a few feet in front of you and smoothly put your right foot on the ball. Spin 180 degrees to your left and pull the ball with your left foot as you complete the rotation. You should have your back to the defender. With the sole of your right foot, pull the ball back onto your left foot, close to the inside of your big toe. If you simultaneously lift your left knee, you will pop the ball up around one or two feet off the ground. At this point, begin to rotate 180 degrees to your left. Halfway through the rotation the ball should be at its peak. Hit the ball with the outside of your right boot up and over both you and your defender and finish the move by completing the rotation and exploding off your left leg past the defender.

, Kick the ball in front of you about 2 yards, run onto it, step over it with one foot and use your other foot to hold it in place against your other foot. Then move your foot on the back of the ball up and kick up with your first foot. If you do it right it will sail over your head and over the defender. sprint around him and explode down the field to score. WARNING-When you Try to do a rainbow, you will most likely fail, don't let it get to you! Try again and again until by some miracle you manage it!

, Push the ball with the outside of your foot in one direction then quickly pull the ball back with inside of the same foot in the opposite direction.

, Play a weighted ball down field past a defender several feet out of their reach then cut quickly behind them and retrieve the ball. Its basically passing the ball to yourself around the defender!!

, This move is pretty hard to do, you are in mid dribble and you heel the ball back to your back foot with your front foot. Then you hit the ball forward with your back foot on your first touch. This move, if done right, can completely fake out almost every defender

Give your gun a paint job.,
Break up the silhouette.,
Use the same techniques for camouflaging the scope.,
For barren and desert environments, a good breakup paint job and a few pieces of foliage will do, as the ""collection"" of foliage will catch your opponents attention.

,
During winter, snow, white textiles or cotton tapes are good alternatives to the military camouflage netting.",How to Camouflage Your Gun," Give it just a base coat or a breakup pattern. Make sure the paint is matte; a shiny surface could give you away. The black base of a gun makes it a clear silhouette in the human mind, and is easy to spot.;
, Riflerags are good for large distances of engagement, but for airsoft and paintball, the burlap is easily seen. The way to go is natural foliage. The cheapest way to camouflage your gun is to find some soft branches, tie them around the gun, and insert foliage into them; this however won't last all day, and will need replacing. A better way to make sure the foliage stays in, is to use an elastic cord, twirl it around the gun, and insert the foliage at several points (2 points is enough for branches and grass; more may be needed for moss).

, For the front lens, take a piece of dyed burlap; take out some of the strands, and secure it with green tape or rubber. You can also cover the upper and lower part of the front with solid material like moss or textile if the lighting conditions allow it. This will certainly hinder the give away lens-reflection.

,, You do not however want to stand out in front of your background as an inverted silhouette, so add some pieces of branches and so on to the gun.

"
"
Figure out which foot works best for you.,
Try doing it standing still.,
Put your other foot sideways behind the ball so that the ball is now between the heel of one foot and the inside of your other foot.,
Lean forward.,
The ball is now up a little on your front leg and you want to kick the ball up with your back leg.,
After you get the hang of that try doing the same thing, but with the ball moving.",How to Do the Rainbow Kick Soccer Trick,"  One foot is going to be in the front.  Some people prefer their dominant foot in front while others prefer their non-dominant foot.  The best thing to do is experiment with both and see which one works better for you.;
,  Most people find this way easier at first and like to try it moving when they get better.  Put one foot (whichever one you prefer) in front of the ball so that the ball is at your heel.

,  It is often best on your back foot to use the inside, but closer to your heel than your toe.  

,  With your back leg you should try to roll the ball up your front leg. 

,  Your lean is important here.  It should create the forward momentum needed to bring the ball over your head.  If you are not leaning forward the ball will go up or behind you. 

,  Some people do find it easier this way, especially after they get it once.  Make sure you get your feet set before you start doing the move.  You need the ball securely between your feet.

Be sure to rid yourself of your dignity.,
Ensure that you are near a player on the other team.,
Time your dive.,
Go to ground.,
Fake an injury.,
When the referee takes whatever actions he deems necessary, get up, limp for a few minutes (if you faked a leg injury) and get back into the game.

",How to Dive in Soccer," You won't be needing it for this maneuver.;
, Diving with nobody around will, at best, make you look like an imbecile.

, While one could dive with no contact, it is very difficult to make it look realistic. Diving is better used to emphasize a real challenge, making a legal tackle look illegal, then it is to make no challenge look like a foul.

, You want to throw yourself at the ground, in whatever manner you choose. However, ensure that it is consistent with the type of foul you are simulating. If you are faking a trip from behind, sprawl out forward. For a shoulder-to-shoulder challenge, fall sideways. To show a shirt-tug from behind, fall on your bottom.

, This is where you get to emulate the professionals... holding your leg and rolling around in pain. Again, be sure the faked injury is consistent with the foul and the fall. For a slide tackle from behind, hold your leg, to fake an elbow to the face, grab your nose.

Get a soccer ball- this is really a must.,
Practice dribbling- Use the inside (instep) and outside of your foot to kick the ball while you run.,
Pass with the inside of your foot.,
To shoot, place the ball at least 10 feet (3.0 m) from a goal or wall.,
For throw-ins, throw the ball over your head with both hands.,
When doing headers, hit the ball with your hairline, not the top of your head.

,
Stay on goal side of the person you are defending.",How to Do Well on a Soccer Team when You've Never Played Before,";
, Make sure your kicks are not too hard, and that the ball does not get too far away from you. The key here is control! Try to get to a point where you no longer have to look down at the ball or your feet to be in control

, Kick the ball to a wall or partner (about 6-10 feet away). The non-kicking foot should end right next to the ball. the ball should get to the wall with good speed and on the ground. If the ball is coming off the ground it's because you are leaning back or not bending your leg. Do not pass with your toes!

, Run up to it and kick with the inside, outside or laces, as hard as possible (while still in control) Make sure your body is over the ball when you shoot, or the ball will go over the goal.

, Both feet (any part of them) must remain on the ground at all times while doing a throw in.

,, Make sure to let your teammates know when you are leaving your man.

Do each of these back:

,straight high kicks, sideways high kicks, open the gate (leg brought from the outside to inside - imagine stepping over something), close the gate (the opposite, inside to outside), lunge then calf stretch (lean back and touch toe), pull the knee up, pull the foot up (do not do if causes any stress on knee) backwards kicks (walking backwards)

Learn the rules.,
Take classes.,
Get certified.",How to Become a Basketball Referee1," The first step toward being a referee for basketball games is learning the rules. In order to be a referee, you must serve as the expert and deliver appropriate calls quickly and confidently. The only way to do so will be to develop a sound understanding of the rules.Purchase a rule book. Some regions have specific rule books that they require referees to have with them at games. Others may simply follow NCAA or NBA rules, in which case you should invest in a rule book for the appropriate organization.
Practice the hand signals on your own to ensure you have a solid understanding of how to execute them.
Focus on enforcing the rules you are learning when watching basketball on TV or as a spectator at local games.;
, You can become a basketball official with little to no training, but as a referee, you will be expected to have a thorough understanding of the rules of the game and how they are enforced. It is highly recommended that you attend an officiating training course.Training courses go over the rules of the game from an officiating perspective, which may be unusual compared to the player’s perspective many are accustomed to.
Some courses provide you with certifications that cushion your credentials as an official.
Many of these classes are organized and run by officiating organizations that can schedule you to officiate games.

, Depending on the level of officiating you choose to do, you will likely need to apply for certification with a local officiating authority. These groups often coincide with regions that schools compete within. Applying to be certified is often as simple as filling out the application online.Some regions offer levels of referee certifications, allowing you to referee different level games based on your experience levels or offered tests.
You will need to pass a background check.
After being certified, you will be expected to attend meetings where other officials discuss the sport and elements of officiating.
Depending on the region, you may need to pay a fee for your certification.

"
"
Volunteer to referee children’s games.,
Follow veteran officials' lead.,
Pursue further education.",How to Become a Basketball Referee2," Once you are certified and have a solid grip of the rules of the game, you will begin by officiating children’s games. Many referees start at the middle school level, serving as the referee in games for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.Officiating younger kid’s games provide you with an opportunity to develop a sound understanding of game mechanics and the officiating process.
Younger kid’s games tend to be slower paced, which allows beginner officials more time to learn the process.

, Basketball games are officiated by a single lead referee and two umpires. Until you are a more established referee, you will serve as one of the two umpires. Lead referees are great resources to learn more about the game and officiating.


Aside from your umpire duties, pay attention to how the lead referee manages the game to learn the process.
Ask the lead referee and other more experienced referees questions in order to improve your ability to officiate.

, Being a referee in basketball games requires continuous learning. Because such a thorough understanding of the rules is required in order to perform adequately and the rules can change, be added or removed every year, it’s important that you continue to attend training as you develop your officiating skills.Attend officiating clinics or training programs offered through your local sports organization or the private sector.
Increasing your officiating credentials will make it easier to transition to serving as a referee in higher level games.

"
"
Register with sports organizations and gain game experience.,
Attend meetings.,
Register with the NCAA and take the officiating exam.,
Apply to referee at NBA camps and the WNBA to get into the NBA.",How to Become a Basketball Referee3," You will often register with the local basketball association as a part of your certification, but do so if you aren’t already a member. If there are other school regions in the area that you can commute to, register with them as well.


Officiating games is the only way to develop a thorough understanding of the mechanics of officiating, so volunteer to referee as many games as possible.
These organizations provide resources and support for officials of most scholastic sports.

, An important part of being a member of a sports organization that provides you with an officiating certification is attending meetings. These meetings provide referees with an opportunity to discuss rule changes and other elements of officiating.Some organizations offer testing as a part of their meeting schedules. These tests will better prepare you to advance to the next level of officiating.
Attending these meetings gives you an opportunity to network with other officials, ask questions and help others with issues they may have.

, Once you have spent a good amount of time officiating at the high school level, you may choose to pursue officiating college level basketball games. The NCAA has a website allows you to register for an account and schedule yourself to take the officiating exam that is required of NCAA referees.In order to serve as a referee in the NCAA you will have to attend an officiating clinic that goes over many of the important elements of working as a referee in college basketball games.
You will then have to take an officiating exam at one of the scheduled dates, times and locations listed on their website.
As is the case for officiating lower level scholastic sports, you will have to pass a background check in order to officiate NCAA games.

, If you are serving as an official in college basketball games and still feel the urge to pursue larger venues, officiating in the NBA may be the right path for you.You can apply for an officiating position with the NBA on their official website: NBAOfficials.com.
It is expected that you have extensive experience refereeing in college games before applying to officiate in the NBA, though it is not necessarily a requirement.
If accepted, you will begin by officiating events with lower viewer bases like camps and WNBA games. Eventually you can work your way up to higher profile games.

Work on your stamina.,
Focus on your lower body.,
Dribble a lot, as much as you can.,
Don't be afraid to make risky passes.,
Be a leader.,
Make sure you show all around brilliance.,
Follow some of these tips:

,
Try to get double teamed or get the attention one of your teammate's defenders so you can get your teammate free and earn an assist by passing it to them and making them SPLASH.

,
Do the unexpected.,
If you are about to score than make the most accurate shot possible.",How to Be an Outstanding Point Guard in Basketball," You should run 2–5 miles (3.2–8.0 km), 2-3 times a week. Stamina won't be an issue if you do this.


A point guard has to be in good shape you will be doing a lot of running so a good diet is good. Eat plenty of carbs. Fruits will give you some good initial energy. And a little junk food every once in a while is not bad. Pasta or potatoes are good to eat before games. But do not eat too much or too close to the game. And drink plenty of water.;
, Basketball is all about explosive legs, so you should be doing squats 2 times a week, 4 sets of 5-8 reps, heavy sets. Also, strong shoulders and abs will help you to be more of a scoring threat, so if you do military presses 2 times a week and leg lifts every other day, you will be able to drive to the basket with ease. By the way, if you can squat twice your body weight once, you have enough muscle to dunk easily. Try doing that once or twice a month.

, Practice dribbling low, with your back straight and with your eyes not looking at the ball. When you practice dribbling, do it different ways. For example: dribble 15 yards (13.7 m) with 2 balls low, then high, then middle. Then, use 1 ball to dribble crossover style, then behind the back, then with spins, etc., etc.

, Hit your post players with some lobs over the defenders, and make sure they're out of reach of the defender.

, Remember the point guard is the leading roll in the game of basketball so always think about the other players on your team. Do not keep the game going too fast. Just because you are in good shape does not mean that the other players are in good shape. If you see one of the players on your team mess up, talk to them and tell them what they're doing wrong and tell them how to do it right. Also when playing basketball you have to do plays that will make your players score better with a high shot percentage.

, Try to get at least 10 points or assist and if you can get rebounds GO GET SOME REBOUNDS.

,,, Make sure the defence has no idea what you're about to do. Just make sure the unexpected play you are about to do isn't stupid.

, You have to shoot open shots,make bank shots in the post,do layups or dunks,try to get to the line,and don't let your defender block you.

"
Recognize that there are three stages at which the save can be made in a breakaway situation.,
To deal with the breakaway situation the goalkeeper must rely on the following visual cues: the speed and angle of the ball, the speed and location of the first attacker, and the presence and location of any other attackers.,
The save can become a foot race if the lead pass to the attacker is too strong or if the attacker's first touch is too far ahead of her.,
There are some areas to consider when making the breakaway save.,
The goalkeeper should also master the concepts of angle play and correct positioning.,
To ensure that the keeper is protected it is important that they have the grass cutter or low ball save technique mastered.,
A final note...The goalkeeper's primary focus should always be on the ball, not on the opponent's eyes.",How to Develop the Understanding of Breakaway Saves in Soccer,"


The first, and best, is before the shot is taken.






The second, is during the process of the shot being taken.






Finally, if the shot cannot be prevented or stopped in progress, it must be saved after it has been taken. This is the least favorable option.





;
, The keeper should also consider the nature and conditions of the game prior to the breakaway. Who's ahead? By what margin? How much time is remaining? What are the field conditions? Who has the momentum? How skilled is the attacker with the ball? Is there a defender closing in?

, The keeper can get to the ball before the shot is taken in this case. The save that is made during the shot is a smother save. The keeper smothers the ball at the shooter's feet before the shooter can get off the shot. The final type of save requires knowing which way to dive and reloading quickly.

, The first is to look for visual cues that the attacker is providing and mirror them. If the attacker is coming at speed then the goalkeeper must respond at speed. Likewise, if the opponent is attacking with patience, then the goalkeeper should respond with patient defense. Often when patient, the ball will find its way to the keeper, because the attacker will run out of time before making a good decision.

, This can be practiced with a logical progression of intensity. The first phase of training should start with no pressure. Then the second phase should contain some, but not all, of the competition to build the keepers confidence and ensure they are using the proper technique to protect themselves, the ball, and covering the best angle. The final phase should be as close to match conditions as possible.

, Driving the hands low and through the ball, catching the ball out in front of the body, arms crooked, and arms parallel will create the barrier to protect the face behind. The mid section is protected by the top leg and knee, which is also used for momentum during the dive and to reload to a standing position. Keepers that are not confident in breakaways or the grass cutter technique will often slide in leading with their knees or feet. Not only does this expose a significant amount of the goal, reduce the likely hood of controlling the ball, it also exposes the face and often results in harsh collisions. As a keeper takes the power step to lower the body and hands during a breakaway save they are driving to and through the ball with their body weight giving the keeper the advantage in force in the event of a collision.

, React don’t anticipate. Stay up as long as possible. Force the attacker to make a good shot. The ball doesn’t lie!

Know some basics: This is all you need to know: Your team wants to put the ball through the hoop.,
Don't stop moving: If you keep moving, you'll have a better chance of getting the ball.,
Do what you can: Though scoring is more praised than other statistics, you can really help contribute to a win by getting rebounds.,
Pass: Chances are, you aren't much of a shooter if you just started out.,
Start small.,
Have a Poker face.,
Use your reputation to your advantage.",How to Be Good at Basketball Immediately," Your team also wants to stop the other team from getting down the court. Don't touch another player unless they touch you. If you want to move with the ball, dribble and don't stop unless you want to pass or shoot. Don't be afraid; be aggressive.;
, Even if you can't do anything else, get the ball so your team can have it.

, Whenever someone (whether on your team or not) shoots the ball, you can jump and get the ball so your team will be able be on offense and score.

, Passing to your teammates is one of the most important mechanics of basketball today. Bounce pass to a teammate who isn't near anyone so they can shoot unguarded.

, If you can start off shooting close to the rim, that's wonderful. Especially if you're smart, you can calculate the physics involved in using the backboard and force to properly allow a basketball to go through the hoop

, Sometimes, you can fool your opponents into thinking one thing with a well-timed fake. This will give your teammates time to get in position.

, What reputation? You've just started playing basketball, so they'll know you're not great. At the beginning of the game, you want to act like you don't know what you're doing so they don't guard you. This way, you'll be wide open when you get the ball to shoot.

You can ask just about anyone who knows the sport, but also check websites, ask coaches, and join a team. Play, play, and play some more until it becomes a part of you.


Understand that basketball is both a physical and mental sport. They are both extremely important. If you lack in one area, focus on trying to improve in that area without forgetting the other. For example, if you need to work on your dribbling, but just finished working on your dribble, dribble up to the hoop from half-court, and shoot a layup.;
, Get down to a gym and start working out. Lesser players can beat the greatest talent if they can outrun and outlast their opponent. Michael Jordan is quoted to have said that the best players are good scorers, good defensive players, and good team players.To be all three, you've got to be in great shape. Here are some exercises to help you out:



Push-ups. Lots of push-ups and in different varieties, like fingertip push-ups. You will be amazed at how much better you can palm the ball if you have strong fingers. Even if you think you don't have large enough hands to palm the ball, it can be done if you have stronger fingers.

Core workouts. Work on your core strength with abdominal crunches, leg lifts, planks, lower back extensions, etc. If you have a strong core you will be able to take a hit and still finish strong at the rim.

Jump rope. Seems like a sissy activity, but it works! Jump rope as fast, long, and hard as you can. The better you can do this, the faster footwork you can have on the court.

Jumping. Increase your vertical leap. If you're fast, agile, and can jump, you can get rebounds even over a taller player. Most super-tall guys don't put all their effort into rebounds since they don't have to. You can beat them if you work at it.

, If you ever find yourself having to concentrate or focus on your dribbling, then you're not good enough to go pro. You should be able to feel where the ball is at all times, have perfect control over it, and be able to do anything you can with it at any moment


Spend tons of time dribbling the basketball. Try dribbling up and down the court or wherever you're practicing. Push yourself to dribble faster, lower, harder, and even more out of control. You'll improve your mobility on the court and your ability to play with the best of them.
Don't let the ball touch your palm. Hold the ball with your fingertips, especially when dribbling.

, Take a look at the best shooters in the game and model their actions. Hold your right hand on the back of the ball, while the left is on the side guiding it. Try practicing by lying down and shooting your basketball straight into the air, so it comes back down onto your hand. You can do this for hours, while listening to music, or just not sleeping. The ball should feel like part of your arm, extending into the hoop.


Shoot free-throws until you can do it in your sleep. There is no reason you should miss any shot that is undefended. Practice shooting when you're cold and when you're totally winded. After running lines and being so tired you can't see straight, that's the perfect time to shoot free-throws.







, This strange little acronym is everything that should be on your mind when shooting. Here are the details:



B=Balance. Make sure you are balanced before you shoot.

E=Eyes. Keep your eyes on the basket while you shoot.

E=Elbow. Keep your elbow in towards your body when you shoot.

F=Follow Through. Make sure you follow through with your shot; your shooting hand should look like you are about to reach into a cookie jar. Even though you may not be able to have elbow strength, always try.

, C stands for concentration and awareness. This is the most important part of shooting. Focus on where the ball is going, not paying ""overt"" attention to who's around you or whether you should shoot/pass instead. Awareness is somewhat ""covert and tricky"" – it is called ""unconscious"" playing (as if flying on your internal automatic pilot). With this, you know about other players and the options and plays, but are not showing concern outwardly or consciously when ""hearing steps."" Options become instinct by practicing and applying it.


Avoid having too much rear-view-mirror thinking or paranoia about what is behind you or in your blind spots. You may need to do some angling, not dribbling exactly straight, and then develop your peripheral vision to watch those areas without focusing on them consciously. Peripheral vision is learned and expanded/extended by using it as with any skill/talent that needs to be automatic in its application.

, To shoot with one-handedly correctly, first make sure you flex your legs for power and your hands for touch and put spin on the ball (""English"").


Line your hands up with the black lines on the ball. Use the pads of your fingers and hold the ball in the center with your writing hand only. Make sure you can see light through all of your fingers. This is your ideal position.
""Touch"" includes shooting/passing harder or softer depending on the situation and on which side of the basket you are shooting/passing because of ball control issues . ""Flex"" entails not being stiff/rigid or over-extended.

, Place your off hand on the side of the ball, realizing that the hand on the side may put some different control and English on the ball. Then shoot (with your CBEEF) making sure most of the force is coming from your shooting/writing hand.


If English (or spin) is new to you, it will require practice and experimenting to see how it affects your shots ""rimming-out"" and checking your banking shots. This effect will depend upon your touch and which side of the basket you happen to shoot.
Practice spin on both sides of the basket. If you are at least somewhat ambidextrous (using either hand), practice both hands as the power vis-a-vis the ""off hand"" for offside shooting (on the non-writing-hand side of the basket).

, All of the practice you can get will help you become the best player you can be. Practice does not make perfect, but perfect practice makes perfect. Here are some drills you can start with:



The Superman Drill. If you have a court this works better, if not you'll have to guesstimate the distances. On a court, start on one baseline (underneath a basket) and run to the first perpendicular line (the nearest free throw line), then drop and do 5 pushups. After that, stand and run back to the original baseline, then run to the next perpendicular line (the 3/4 court line). Drop and do 10 push ups and continue on that same idea for every line on the court, back and forth, until you reach the first line again. Again, it is best to shoot at least 10 free throws after the drill while you are tired.







The Kill Drill. This is a full court, down and back timed drill. If you're really out of shape, start with 4-6 ""down and backs"" in 1 minute 8 seconds (starting at 1 baseline running to the other and returning to the original). Sounds like a sufficient amount of time until you run the 160 feet (48.8 m). After you build up some stamina, try 13 down and backs in 68 seconds. Again, shoot at least 10 free throws while fatigued.







The Buddy Drill. Have a buddy grab a basketball and start on a corner of one baseline, with you guarding him. If you feel comfortable, keep your hands behind your back. Have him dribble diagonally down the court with you forcing him to change directions as he dribbles down the court. You'll need to learn how to ""slide step"" down the court to stay ahead and direct the person with the ball.







, Look for the open man, and pass the ball, even if you want to make a shot. The better your team does, the better you do. you not only have to be a shooter, but a team player as well. Don't hog the ball; eventually your other teammates and coaches will get annoyed and you'll be labeled as a selfish player, risking it all for the bench.


And whatever you do, don't lose your confidence. If you're a shooter, shoot until you get your touch or rhythm! If you're playing the big D, clear your mind until you can anticipate movement. Eat a protein and carbohydrate-rich meal, take a breather, and get back at it if you're feeling discouraged. No path to greatness has ever been easy.

, There are babies who are practically born with a basketball in their hands, and these are the kids that grow up to be the pros. It's best to start as young as possible to get in as much experience as you can. Start young and basketball will be flowing through your veins.


Being on the school and community team is great, but consider attending basketball camps like Five Star Basketball Camp, National Basketball Academy, and Elite Hoops Basketball Camp.For a few hundred dollars each season, you'll work with the best of the best in your region and start honing higher level skills.

, In order to get noticed for the college level (your next step), you need to stick out like a speck of gold on your high school's basketball team. This doesn't mean being a ball hog – in fact, not being a team player is something that'll work against you. It simply means taking risks, going for the shot, feeding off your teammates' strengths, and making it happen.


In addition to being a great player, you've also got to be coachable and easy to work with, too. If you're keeping others from playing their best, you won't get recruited. And if you have weaknesses your coach is trying to improve but your attitude keeps you from listening, you won't get recruited. Work on your skills as a player, but also work on your skills as a team member and someone who's still learning.

, If you're the best basketball player that ever walked this earth you may be able to get away with terrible grades, but most colleges are looking for a player who can also manage themselves academically, too. You don't have to have straight A's, but you need to prove that you can handle going to school and playing a sport at the same time. This goes for high school and college. It's your academics that are allowing you to play.


And the higher your grades, the better your chances of getting a basketball scholarship (or any scholarship, for that matter). You'll be a role model and a model student that any college would want to recruit.

, When coaches talk about the players that catch their eye, it's not just their sweet three-pointer or their ability to dribble the ball like it's barely touching the floor. They're also looking for players with a high basketball IQ; that is, not only are they good at the game, but they understand at a very intricate level how it works.They're constantly thinking of all the ways to make the next shot, how to overcome obstacles, and they have poise and keep to a rhythmic, calm tempo. There's much more to basketball than just basketball.


Part of a high basketball IQ is also about never ""getting out of the game."" Even if the ref calls a shot you disagree with, you're back on the floor immediately in the zone for the next play. A player with a high basketball IQ handles every obstacle with dignity and respects the others on the court at all times.

, If you're incredibly lucky, scouts may come to you. If they don't, you have two basic options:


Talk to your coach. Does he have any connections when it comes to colleges? Does he think you're scout material? What do you have to do to get noticed?
Send out letters to coaches at your desired schools. Express your interest in their program, provide why you are interested and why you think you'd e a good asset to their program. Give them a highlight tape and invite them to come watch you play. Be sure to include your contact information for further discussion.

, Players very, very, very, very, very rarely go straight from high school to the NBA. Most have some college or finish their 4 years. It's during this time that you'll play against a higher-caliber opponent and truly hone your skills under pressure. It's up to you during this time whether you want to finish out college or try to go pro before your academic career is up.


Which in college, it's a good idea to coach in the off-season, keep attending camps, and always, always, always keep playing and staying in shape. Even though the season doesn't last all year long, if you're taking this seriously, yours does.

, If you're really, really good and you've been seriously molded for professional play, consider getting an agent. They have the connections you need to get your name noticed and potentially be a part of next year's draft. They'll get your name out there and, hopefully, money in your pocket.That being said, if you get an agent during your college career, you lose your college eligibility – even if you don't get drafted.Consider this very carefully before you jeopardize the next couple years of your life.

, With an agent in tow, you'll likely sign up for the pre-draft camps at the NBA level. There, you'll make a ton of connections and get your name and your face known. If you can handle the pressure, this may be the exposure you need to turn pro.


This will also grant you the opportunity to get feedback on your draft position, who's looking at you, and what your potential for getting drafted is. The only thing you can do in this situation is to keep calm and play your best.

, There are two rounds of the draft. One by one, players get chosen by teams, also one by one. In other words, you get one chance to get drafted. If you're willing to accept it, fantastic. If you're not, you could try being a free agent and go from there, or not play in the NBA.


If you're semi-okay with it, you could negotiate pay or terms of your contract, making it shorter if you're looking to leave sooner. However, not being willing to take what you're given is pretty rare.
If you're a second-round draft pick, you may not make it onto the opening night roster. Know what you're in for and what the terms are before you assume anything.

, If you weren't picked for the draft or you were unhappy with the outcome of events, you could play for the D-league of the NBA or overseas. The D-league is similar to the minor leagues and you could, in theory, get pulled up into the NBA.


Overseas, however, is a completely different story and a completely different machine. Your agent will help score an interview with this one and you could get picked to go somewhere exotic (or not so exotic) for the next year. If you're willing to move, it can be a pretty well-playing gig.

, Your odds of making it into any pro sport just aren't good. Point blank. Sure, it's possible, but you the odds aren't exactly in your favor. In fact, around 1% of all college players (men and women, though it's microscopically higher for men) make it to the pros. That means out of you and 99 others, only one person will get chosen. If you don't make it, you're in good company.


Plenty of talented basketball stars still make a living out of their passion coaching, teaching at camps, or playing in different countries and different leagues. Just because you didn't make it professionally like you envisioned does not mean you have to give up your career.

The best thing you can do is start by practicing your strength to build up for it.,
Practice sprints to wear you down.,
Put up a cone or obstacle pretending it's a defender and practice charging, driving, stuttering, and dribbling around it to take shots.,
With the cone as well, try doing fake pumps and drives or fake passes and shoot.,
Get a few steps away from the basket, nearly beneath it, and practice pushing up with one hand in the correct form (basketball on the tips of your fingers, hand flat and back, push up straight and flick your wrist to ""reach into the cookie jar).,
Don't forget to practice wide corner shots, side shots, three points, and from different locations.,
Practice dribbling around for 15-30 minutes a day.,
Go to something relaxing like yoga—even kids can do it.,
Work with a friend.,
Join a team.,
Have fun!",How to Be a Great Basketball Shooter," You'll need strong legs to jump and arms to push the ball into the shot. If you're younger, (10-12) try 50 push ups and 100 wall-jumps (find a wall, reach up, and jump to touch the top of the door or higher). If you're in teen years, double the number. For adults, triple. Try to do this four-five times a week to build muscle.;
, In a game, you won't be walking, stopping, shooting. Do 5-10 down and backs in your lawn, then pick up the ball and shoot 10 free throws. Do this a few times over. Free throws are the easiest shot that you'll be expected to make, and practicing shooting them when you're sweaty and worn down will be a great help.

, You won't have open hoop in a game and will need to be used to looking at the defender instead of the ball and getting around it.

, These motions will help trick defenders in a game and the more you practice doing them on your own, the more natural you'll be at tricking defenders in a game and you'll have better chances at making shots.

, Do this from both sides and straight in front for about 30 shots each, 3 times. Practicing form will make it come more naturally and make you shoot in the correct form to up your percentage of made shots. It's basic, but it really helps when you're naturally shooting in the correct form.

, Practice about 10 shots in 5 different locations three times over. This will help you get used to shooting in common positions you'll be in during a game so you can sink them from any position.

, If you can't dribble, you won't be able to move around defenders and won't get a chance to shoot.

, Stretching is important before and after to make you more flexible and in shape and prevent injury.

, That's the easiest way to improve is doing 1 on 1 games (or more if you can gather more players) once or twice a week. Practice being in the game-mode and taking shots.

, Practice makes perfect, and actually being on a team working will help you improve. You can join a club by searching or asking athletic centers or do a camp if it's off-season.

, When you get a chance and you're in the mood, go out and start shooting around. Don't push yourself too much or it won't be fun anymore and you'll burn out. Spread out different drills throughout the week."

",How to Be a Confident Basketball Player," These will all help you once you have totally controlled these important parts of basketball.;
, Try getting the ball, and shoot. Either with a lay-up or outside shot. Although, remember to not be a ball hog and force up a shoot, pass the ball around, too!

, At the beginning, they will only notice your misses, but as you improve they will only notice what goes in! And that's what you want don't you?

, You can shoot and do anything else when you feel necessary. The worst that can happen is that you will be taken out of the game or be yelled at.

, That is the most important part of it all! Don't let people step all over your confidence, because sadly we live in that kind of a world. Block out your teammates bad words and change them with good words.

, You will eventually get there. Take what Brian Scalabrine said after the Celtics kicked Laker butt: ""In five years you won't remember my misses, in ten years I'll be an MVP of the league, in 15 years I'll lead my team to an NBA championship and in 60 years I'll be telling my grand kids about all my accomplishments."" I have written these words on my wall and read them to myself every morning. These words are very meaningful and you should really think about them.

, Being with them and playing with them will really influence you.

Improve your ball handling skills.,
Improve your passing ability.,
Improve your shooting.,
Condition your body.",How to Be a Good Basketball Player1," Some experts believe the ability to handle the ball well is the most important skill in the game. You shouldn’t have to think too hard about dribbling the ball if you practice a lot. A good way to improve this skill is through dribbling drills.


Practice with circle dribbles. In this drill, you use one hand to dribble the ball in circles around your right foot. Then switch to the other hand and leg. Practice dribbling between cones or chairs.
Try doing figure 8 dribbles, in which you dribble the ball in and out of your legs, using a figure 8 motion. Bounce the ball from one hand to the other. Practice your dribbling with both hands so you can more easily change directions on the floor.
Dribble suicide drills condition you while improving drilling ability. Start at the baseline. Dribble in a sprint to the closest free throw line and back. Then dribble to mid court line and back. Then dribble to the farthest away free throw line and back. Finally, dribble all the way to other side of the court and then back.
Start at one end of the court. Dribble the entire length of the court and make a layup or a jump shot. Get your own rebound, and do the same thing, moving to the other end of the court. Do this three times as fast as you can.;
, Passing is a skill that basketball players must master. There are two basic ways to pass. One is a chest pass in which you throw the ball to your teammate without it bouncing. The second is a bounce pass, in which you bounce the ball once when throwing it to your teammate. This is the hardest pass for a defender to intercept.


Players working on passing abilities might want to play a pickup game that uses no dribbling at all so they can focus more on passing. Practice passing with two hands. This will give you more control over the ball.
Put your weight into the pass by stepping into it. This will improve ball speed and control. Aim for your teammates’ hands when passing to them. Pass to a specific team member rather than throwing the ball in the direction of their voice.
Your thumbs should point down at the end of a pass, and you should follow through. Otherwise the ball will be harder to catch because it won’t have the right back spin.
You don’t have to pass a ball with great speed. Don’t forget the easy pass. If you get too tricky, you might provoke more turnovers.
Don’t jump when passing. If you do this, you can’t land with the ball so it’s harder. Move toward the ball when it’s being passed to you. That makes it harder for a defender to intercept it. Try to catch it with two hands.

, The shooters get a lot of the glory, and they are obviously critical to the game. But you don’t want to be in a situation where people are blocking your shots or you miss a lot of them. That will land you on the bench.


Use your fingertips. This helps you maintain proper control of the ball when shooting.
Bend your legs and stay small when you begin the shot. Then, spring up, and end tall, with your body straightened and hands up in the air. When players start shooting while standing straight, they can lower their shooting percentage. The legs are critical in shooting. In fact, you should play the entire game with your knees mostly bent. Go for the higher percentage shots. Don’t always try to shoot the tricky shots. Figure out which shots are difficult for you to make, and focus on the easier shots. This will make you seem like a better shooter overnight.
Point the elbow toward the middle of the rim, and keep it in, as well as your middle finger when you follow through. Finish your shot as if you are dipping your hand into the rim. Proper follow through also means that your fingers should hang down, not be together or pointed.
Fully extend your arm at the end of your shot, with your elbow snapping back. And keep your elbow at the level above your eyes when you release the ball.

, You need to perform practice drills that condition your body in a way that is designed for basketball offensive play, not just exercises like you might do for fun. Coaches look for players with good conditioning - an explosive first step or who can jump 2 feet (0.61 m) in the air. Use a pre-planned workout. There are many basketball conditioning plans that will help you get in shape and improve your stamina. Even 45 minutes three times a week can make a big difference. Some conditioning workouts suggest exercises like skipping rope, sprinting from the free-throw line to the net and slapping the net with the hands, shooting for one minute from different spots on the court, and performing defensive slide moves.

Learn the technique.,
Practice shooting from every position and angle.,
Keep practicing.,
Learn to move without the ball.",How to Be a Good Basketball Shooter," There's no point shooting hundred of baskets/nets if you're doing it the wrong way, is there? Ask your coach, PE teacher, team members or somebody who knows the game very well how to shoot accurately, and any tips they have.


A good technique is ""FOREST.""

Finger- Dominate your release with your index finger.
Off Hand- Touch your off hand to your shooting arm just below the wrist after you shoot.
Rhythm- Dip the ball to your waist or thigh before you shoot when coming off a pass.
Eyes- Have your shooting side eye covered by the ball as you release, and watch the flight of the ball.
S- Sweep and Sway- Jump forward six inches to a foot as you shoot, and get your shoulders back and relaxed.
T- Turn- Start with your feet turned about 10-45 degrees towards your opposite hand and turn towards your opposite hand as you jump in the air, landing with your feet pointing between 20 and 90 degrees towards your opposite hand.

;
, If you keep shooting from the halfway line, you'll be perfect, but you'll stink at all the other positions. Practice shooting from everywhere-even from behind the net. You need the extra practice, and you can gain some more skill and pick up a few tips by doing this. Practice shooting by yourself, then practice while someone is defending you. Dribble up and shoot for basketball, throw the ball to a few people and then shoot for netball.

, You can never get enough practice. Gather up a few friends in the backyard, or walk down to the local gym. Try to practice a couple of times a week, as well as any training or classes. Pay attention in PE and training. Always listen to your teachers and coaches. They have lots of great tips.

, If you look at great shooters such as Ray Allen or JJ Redick, they are never standing still. Use available picks and screens to create an open shot, or use baseline cuts to create some space between you and a defender.

Keep your feet moving.,
Stay low.,
Put your hand on the ball.,
Become a better rebounder.,
Improve your defensive conditioning.,
Try lower body strength training.,
Try upper body strength exercises.",How to Be a Good Basketball Player2," A good defender must be quick on the feet and constantly on the move. If you stand still too long on the court, you won’t be good at this position.









Mentally envision that you’ve stepped in paint. Ask yourself, how many of your footprints will you see on the court? You want to “paint the floor” by moving a lot and being everywhere. Increase your activity on defense, and you will be more effective.
Try for every single ball. Don’t keep your eye on the ball – keep your eye on the other player. Otherwise you could be tricked by ball fakes. Maintain eye contact with the player you are guarding. Keep the player away from the baseline and force him or her to the front of the rim.

, Good defenders bend their knees. They spend most of the game moving and crouched low. They should also keep their head lower than the head of the person they are guarding. 








Keep feet wide apart and legs bent when on defense. Constantly move your feet. It will be easier for an offensive player to get past you if your legs are together or your feet crossed.
Keep your nose lower than the nose of the person you are guarding. This way you can react quickly to motion made by your opponent. Standing upright can make a defender lose balance. Your feet should be shoulder length apart, with your knees bent slightly. , If you are careful, you can use this technique to be a better defender without fouling the player you are guarding.









If the opponent is holding the ball in shooting position, put your hand on the ball. This will make it harder for them to shoot the ball.
If your opponent has the ball below their mid-section, put your hand on top of the ball. This will make it harder for them to shoot.

, Rebounding the ball can determine the outcome of games. Your team can't score if it doesn't have possession.









Move to the inside position, so you have a better chance at the ball. Don’t stand straight. If you squat down, you will have more power in your jump and a better chance at the ball. When you jump for the ball, keep both hands as outstretched as you can.

, Defenders need to do a lot of running and must stay low to properly guard another player. Defensive endurance training will improve play.









Doing a wall sit is a good way to improve your defensive conditioning. All you need to do is find a wall and sit down, as if you were sitting in a chair (but without one). Stand with your back to the wall. Slide down the wall until your knees are in a 90-degree angle with the floor. Hold the position for about 60 seconds when starting out.
Try jumping rope with two legs and go as fast as you can. Time and count your jumps so you can track progress. It sounds simple, but jumping rope is a great way to improve your conditioning for basketball. That’s because it improves endurance but also agility.
Try agility drills. Start on the baseline, right side. Sprint to the top right corner of the free throw line, shuffle to the left corner, backpedal to the baseline and shuffle to where you started. Then, move to the right corner and do the same thing. Boys should be able to do this in 10-14 seconds and girls in 11-15 seconds.

, Lifting weights will improve your body’s overall strength, which is good on defense when you need to get rebounds or block shots. You want to vary exercises, though.









Do squats. Take a dumbbell, keep feet flat on the ground and go as low as you can, keeping your thighs parallel to the ground.
Try lunges and step ups. Using a barbell or dumbbell, keep your leading foot flat on the ground and your torso erect. Step up on a box and then down again or lunge forward with each leg. , These exercises are divided into pushes and pulls. You can use bands to help you by putting a foot or knee into a band when doing things like chin-ups or pull-ups if they are hard for you in the beginning.









Use a barbell or dumbbell to do bench presses or shoulder presses. To bench press, lie on a weight bench with your feet on the floor. Unlock the bar and lift it with straight arms. Lower it to mid-chest, and then press it upward, locking your elbows. Don’t move your butt off the bench. Try to do this in sets of five reps. Use a barbell or dumbbell to perform bicep curls. When doing a bicep curl, you want to stand straight with a dumbbell in each hand. Keep your elbows in close to your body. Make sure your palms face forward. Then curl the dumbbell until the biceps fully contract and dumbbells stop at the shoulder. Now, lower the dumbbells to the starting position, and repeat. .

Master the rules.,
Study the game.,
Understand your role.,
Be mentally tough.,
Remember it’s a team sport.",How to Be a Good Basketball Player3," Sometimes younger basketball players forget the game’s rules. If you don’t know the rules by heart, you will cause problems for your team. A good way to master the rules is by joining a club team when you’re young or in the summer in between seasons.


If the team on offense has the ball behind the mid-court line, it has 10 seconds to move the ball over the mid-court line or it loses the ball. Knowing a rule like this helps you prevent turnovers.
The offensive team can’t bring the ball back over the mid-court line once it gets the ball over the mid-court line, or it loses the ball. These are the kinds of rules that smart basketball players know. , You need to understand everything you can about your position and about court strategy. You are going to get more playing time if you are a strategic player in addition to one with strong technical skills.


You can find many training videos on You Tube.
Study your past games and those of the competition. What worked? What went wrong? After a game, sit down with your coach. Together, try to come up with one area that you need to improve. Then, work on that area in practice.

Find a mentor. You can ask a basketball coach or find a good basketball player who'd be willing to teach you.
Different coaches have different philosophies and systems. Figure out yours so you can adapt to it. Maybe they don’t want point guards to get more than three turnovers in a game. Whatever their own personal rules are, it’s helpful if you learn them. Watch professional and other high-level games to see how the best play the game. Use what you learn in your own game.

, Don’t focus solely on scoring. One mistake young players make is they put all the emphasis on scoring. Focus on how you can add value to your team. Maybe you are a great passer, for example.


If you’re not good at being a three-point shooter, don’t try it much. You should give up the ball to the teammate who’s better at that role.
Maybe you are a great catch-and-shoot player. Then focus on that. If you are a center, you want to spend your time practicing rebounding and post drills, not dribbling. So figuring out your role also helps you pick the right training exercises.

, Basketball is a mental game, not just a physical one. Some experts say the mental aspects of the game are 70% of it. Coaches look for players with mental toughness. Provide 100 percent effort. Basketball is a game of dedication and persistence. Don’t be afraid to be criticized, either. It’s how you will learn. Coaches want players who are passionate, determined, who want to get better and who will work hard to do so, and who have the will to prepare to win, not just the will to win.
Be aggressive. Coaches look for players who are aggressive and focused on the court and off it. They want someone who will dive on the floor if there is a loose ball and is constantly applying pressure to other players when acting as a defender. , Basketball consists of two teams, each containing five players each, who try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop that is 10 feet off the ground on each end of the court.


Great players elevate their teammates’ play when they are on the court.
To be a good team player, pass more often, run for an open space to help that teammate being surrounded by the opposite team, help block, help with rebounds, etc. People will like you and will return you the favor!

Get to know the court's geometry: You have to know all the measures from where you play, so you can have a better spacial notion.,
Understand shooting implications: When you shoot you are involving three factors: angles, the impulse, and the position of your arms.,
Recognize the math in bouncing: The ball is a semi-sphere that, according to Newton, will have a reaction depending on the force you apply it.,
Get an assistant to record percentages: You have to know how many rebounds, shoots, steals, and counter attacks you are making, so you can improve on the areas were you have low performance.,
Understand the parabola in shoots: The parabola is the downside curve that's made in every shoot.,
Apply geometry in rebounding: Whenever the ball is shot from one side, from a field shoot, it will end on the other side, the most of the times; when shot from the free throw zone it will mostly rebound on the same side.,
Understand defensive implications: Every defense has got to know how geometry is applied, so they can know how they can steal more balls, avoid being tricked and stop their man from scoring.",How to Apply Math and Geometry in Basketball," The hoop diameter (18 in), the length from hoop to hoop (94/84 ft), the ball itself (9.4 in diameter), the field wideness (50 ft), and the length from the three point line to the hoop (19 ft).;
, You have to apply a greater angle (understanding the angle as a perpendicular line from your hips, and the extension of your arms) if you make a field shot, but a smaller one when you shoot from inside the free throw zone. You may shoot higher when you have some defenders in front of you. Also I recommend to shoot from a 45 degree angle or greater angle, because that helps the ball to enter softer and cleaner to the basket. Your elbow should be the closest possible to your face so the ball goes in a straight line. Extend your arm as far as you can so you have greater force.

, When poorly pumped up, it will not bounce as well as when it is full of air. It also doesn't bounce as well when you don't it bounce correctly. You have to apply the ball a relative amount of force, depending if you want to give a long bounce pass, if you are running, or if you are dribbling. My advice is that when dribbling, apply considerable force to the ball, and bounce it close to the floor, so that you can have better control. Use a straighter angle on bound passes if you want them to get further, and when running keep it at the height of your hips so you maintain your speed.

, Record the attempted and made shoots. The offensive and defensive rebounds. The total steals and counter attacks on the game. The second chance points you made and the team's shooting tendencies.

, As you are shooting you may realize that as higher the parabola the cleaner or easier the ball gets inside the hoop, and as lower, the more chances there are the ball hits the rim. For the parabola effect to be completed you should apply the ""follow through"" with your wrist, that means you shall give the ball a back flip effect at the end of your shot using your hand.

, When more force is applied the rebound will get further, when little force implied, the ball will fall in the same place it hit. So familiarize yourself with rebounding implications so you can guess every time where the ball's going.

, The first implication are the defensive angles at which you stand your man, when you are half-sided, you have an advantage, as he cannot get past you as easy as if you faced him directly with no body angle. The same is applied to the angle of your legs on defensive position, the more folded your legs the faster you are. Finally realize that when you displace with the higher front part of your feet (tips), you also are faster, as there is faster contact with the floor.

"
First, pick a comfortable shooting location (many find it easiest to shoot from the free throw line, the elbows of the key on either side of it, or close to the hoop).,
Get into a strong shooting stance.,
Bring the ball into shooting position.,
Flex your knees, then jump!,
Launch the ball.,
Release and follow through.,
Start shooting from around the basket.,
Use the backboard for angled shots.,
Aim for the hoop for head-on shots.,
Give your jump shots a healthy arc.,
Practice your three point shot.,
Practice with a partner to put pressure on you.,
Try a pull-up jumper.,
Try a turnaround jump shot.,
Try a fadeaway shot.,
Try a pump fake.",How to Shoot a Jump Shot," Turn your body to face the hoop and plant your feet on the ground. Your feet should be turned towards your opposite hand about 10-45 degrees in order to align your hip, shoulder, and elbow with the basket.


If you're just starting to learn how to make jump shots, begin by practising on your own — in other words, don't have a friend ""cover"" you until you've made a few shots on your own or it'll be hard to make progress.;
, Believe it or not, the way you position your feet and lower body can have a big impact on your shooting accuracy even though you don't directly use them to shoot the ball.Flex your knees slightly to give yourself the flexibility you'll need to power your jump.









Shoulder-width or narrower foot positioning is important for your shooting speed and balance. Keep your feet closer together and you'll be fine. Keep them too wide apart and you won't be able to give your jump enough power or react quickly to changes on the field., Dip the ball to your shooting side waist or thigh. Spread your fingers and hold the ball with your fingertips to get as much control of the ball as possible. Position your shooting hand (the same one you write with) behind the ball so that the back of this hand faces directly away from the basket. Position your non-shooting hand on the side of the ball so that the thumb on this hand points toward your forehead.









Your non-shooting hand is just as important for your shot as your shooting hand, so don't neglect it. Though it won't give your shot any power, it's largely responsible for shot control and balance. To see how important your non-shooting hand is, once you've gotten the hang of your jump shot, try shooting one-handed!

, Push with your hips and legs to launch yourself into the air.









For the greatest accuracy, as you flex, keep the forearm (ulna) aligned vertically, so that the the hinged motion is always in line with the hoop. Think of shooting as a smooth hinged motion with your elbow as the hinge. Ideally, the forearm should be aligned pointing at the hoop. If your elbow moves out of alignment as you shoot, it will change the direction of the ball, so get in the habit of keeping it tucked in. In order to do this, turn your feet towards your opposite hand., As you jump, bring the ball (which you should still be holding with proper hand placement) up in front of your body. Start to launch the ball up and toward the basket in an arc with your shooting arm only. Straighten your shooting arm elbow as you shoot, but keep it in line with your body.Your non-shooting hand should only be used for keeping the ball under control and thus should stay on the side of the ball where it won't affect the path of the shot.









Many coaches recommend looking at a certain part of the hoop as you make your shot. Some coaches recommend targeting the back of the hoop (especially for players who tend to under-shoot), others recommend the front of the hoop (especially for players who tend to over-shoot), and others coaches actually recommend visualizing the spot the ball will need to go for a ""swish"". The last option requires the most concentration, but some individuals claim that it achieves the best results., At the top of your jump, release the ball by turning your wrist downward. The ball should roll off of your shooting hand, touching your index finger last. At this point, your shooting hand and arm should look roughly like you pinching your index finger and thumb together, with your other fingers higher. After you release the ball, let your shooting arm come down naturally, making sure you have turned your hips towards your opposite hand, landing with your feet pointed between 20 and 90 degrees towards your opposite hand.









Try to get in the habit of releasing the ball at the top of your jump. Though you can make shots if you shoot earlier or later, doing so tends to make your shots jerky and inaccurate.Also, releasing at the top of your jump gives you an advantageous shooting position — it's harder for defenders to block you when you're high in the air., In an actual game of basketball, obviously, you won't be able to shoot easy, direct jump shots from the free throw line or the wings all the time — it's the defense's job to prevent this. To begin to increase your versatility as a shooter, start to shoot from all over the court. You'll soon find that some shooting positions are much easier than others, but you'll only be an effective shooter if you're able to start hitting shots from all around the hoop, so practice these tricky shots!









In general, you'll want to eventually be able to hit shots from anywhere inside the three point line and, ideally, just beyond it. You'll almost never be expected to shoot from more than a few feet behind the three point line during a game, so you don't have to worry as much about shooting these long-bomb shots. In order to shoot longer shots, jump forward further and turn more. This will give you more power.

, Most of the time, the defense will try to deny you a direct, easy path to the basket. For this reason, you'll usually be shooting at the basket not from head-on, but from an angle. From angled positions, it's trickier to get a ""swish"" than when shooting from head-on, so most players try to bounce their shots off of the backboard. This slows the ball and angles it down into the basket, increasing the likelihood of an angled shot going in.









Believe it or not, there has been actual scientific research done on this aspect of shooting a jump shot. The results indicate that the best angled shots tend to hit the backboard at a spot in the top middle section of the square behind the hoop. As the angle of the shot becomes more pronounced (that is, as a player shoots from further to one side), the ""ideal"" backboard spot moves up and away from this central point in a diagonal direction (in other words, someone shooting from the right side of the hoop should try to hit the backboard above and to the right of the top middle of the square). , When you do get a chance to make a shot from straight in front of the basket, research shows that the benefits of using the backboard are less pronounced. In these cases, you may want to try to try for a ""swish"" (a shot that goes through the hoop without touching the rim or backboard). These can be tricky to make at first, but can become almost intuitive with frequent practice.









One head-on shot you'll want to practice plenty is the one you make from the free throw line. Free throw shots are some of the only shots you'll get to take without being guarded by a defender, so it's important to practice to the point that you can make most of them. On average, NBA players tend to make about three-quarters of their free throws; for high school players, this statistic is closer to one-half., When the ball approaches the hoop, the angle it's traveling at can have a big effect on how likely it is to go in. Steep-angled shots (those with high arcs) are, in theory, more likely to score points.However, in reality, it's usually quite difficult for players to control high-arced shots. Thus, players looking to perfect their jump shot should try to aim for the perfectly-balanced shot — one with a medium-high arc that's still easy to control.









Some basic research has been done on the effectiveness of various shooting arcs. Based on this research, the minimum arc for a shot to be able to make a ""swish"" shot is about 32o — with a regulation-size hoop and a men's ball, making a ""swish"" with this arc requires basically a perfect shot. On the other hand, high-arced shots (like, for instance, 55o) are very tough to control — even a tiny error can send the ball off-course.From this research, a happy medium of about 45o seems preferable for most shooters.

, A great three point jump shot is a huge asset to the team — if you're able to consistently sink shots from behind the line, the defense will have no choice but to guard you constantly, preventing at least one of their team members from covering the rest of the players. This means you'll want to spend plenty of time perfecting your three point shot. Three-pointers can be extra tricky — the additional power needed to get the ball to the hoop makes the shot harder to control — but they're worth the work.









Don't forget to move around the court as you practice your three-pointer. Some of the hardest shots of all in basketball are three point shots from the side of the hoop. These shots force you to make a ""swish"", since you can't hit the backboard from this angle. If you can master these shots, you'll be a major shooting threat on the court.

, No matter how much you practice alone, you can't replicate the experience of a defender trying to block your shot. Once you're fairly confident with basic jump shots, try getting a friend to guard you as you move around the court and take your shots. Remember, in a real game, it's the defense's job to make sure you never get an easy shot, so the more practice you get against actual players, the better.









Shooting around a dogged defender can be seriously challenging — you'll need good dribbling and ball-handling skills to get your defender to slip up long enough for you to squeeze in a shot, so you may want to practice these skills separately.

, Basketball can be a lightning-fast game. During a fast break, for instance, offensive players usually don't have time to stop moving, calmly line up their shot, and make it when they're ready — instead, they either have to drive straight to the hoop and go for a lay-up or make a jump shot immediately. When a player goes straight from running into making a jump shot in one fluid motion without any pause, this is called a ""pull-up jumper"". Once mastered, this skill is a valuable one, as it allows you to make shots from virtually anywhere around the basket without giving the defense any time to react.









To make a pull-up jumper, start off by dribbling at a fast jog or run down the middle of the court. As you near the free throw line, flare out a few feet to the side. Come to a balanced stop in rhythm with your steps as you bring the ball up into both hands. Without hesitating, immediately get low, jump, and shoot. Practice until you can pull this move off quickly without stopping at any point.

, What do you do when you get the ball off of a pass and a defender is immediately right behind you, blocking your path to the hoop? One way to get out of this situation is to use a technique called a turnaround shot. In a turnaround shot, the player with the ball pretends to go one way, then spins in the opposite direction and shoots as soon as he's facing the hoop. Most of the time, this will give him a small window during which he can shoot without the defender blocking him.









To shoot a turnaround shot, start with your back to the hoop and a defender guarding you closely from behind. Back towards the hoop as you dribble and stay low until you're a comfortable shooting distance away from it. Take a step in the direction of your throwing hand as you drop your non-shooting foot back slightly. Quickly pivot around on your non-shooting foot and make your jump shot immediately.

, Many of the NBA's all-time greatest players had masterful fadeaway jump shots. As their name hints at, fadeaway shots are jump shots made when a player jumps and leans backward. This technique brings the ball away from the defender, giving the shooter extra room to shoot and making the shot very tough to guard against. However, it can be very hard to make fadeaway shots, so they're often seen as the mark of an excellent (or selfish) player.









To make a fadeaway, start an ordinary jump shot or a turnaround shot as you normally would. As you jump, push yourself upward and backward, putting space between yourself and the player behind you. Lean back with your spine for extra space. Square up with the hoop in the air and hold the ball just above your head. When you reach the highest point of your jump, shoot the ball with a snapping motion of the wrist.
Note that fadeaways require much more wrist strength than ordinary shots because much of the power from the legs that would ordinarily be used for the shot is spend propelling the shooter backwards.

, An important part of having a great jump shot is knowing when not to shoot. By carefully interspersing your shots with the occasional fakeout, you can keep defenders on their toes. More importantly, however, is the fact that a convincing fake can open up shooting opportunities when you're being guarded by a defender that just won't leave you alone.









To make a pump fake, get low as you normally would just before taking a shot. Bring the ball up in front of you and prepare to jump. Start to rise up, but stop yourself just short of actually jumping. If your defender falls for your fake and jumps, either quickly dart around him or time your own jump so that you shoot just as he's hitting the ground to give yourself a free shot.
It's important to stay in contact with the floor during your pump fake. Taking even a small hop without shooting constitutes an ""up-and-down"" penalty in basketball.

If a teammate is open and you are being blocked, pass it to them immediately. That will give your teammate more of a chance to get an easy shot.
It's often tempting to take a shot as soon as you get the ball. Unless you have an unblocked jump-shot or an easy layup, do not take the shot.;
, Bend and release quickly in one swift motion, since you may have too much pressure to take proper time to aim.

, Keeping your head up can not only give a player a better shot than you, but it can give you a shot as well if they pass it back.

, Passing it high in the air is not a good idea. Pass firmly, as it should be flying through the air quick enough so that any opponent player cannot intercept it.

, If you shoot and it's clear that the ball is not going into the net, try to grab an offensive rebound. ,

, You will never grow to be a better basketball player if you do not take risks. If you never try shots that you haven't done before, you will never improve!

, Besides helping you improve, a coach will notice this and pick you above somebody else who may not work as hard. Don't be afraid to get your butt on the ground and dive after some loose balls.

, A good shot is an open shot that you can make a high-percentage of and nobody else on your team has a better scoring opportunity. If you take bad shots, you'll be on the bench.

, Any time you get in a huddle, always sprint to the front and make eye contact with the coach while he is talking. The coach will notice this and know that you care and are listening intently.

Practice in a game setting.",How to Shoot a Basketball," Your shooting foot is the foot on the same side as your shooting arm – if you’re right handed, it will be your right foot. Your feet should be turned 10 to 45 degrees towards your off hand side, and your shoulder, hip, and elbow should be aligned with the basket.;
, Locking your knees makes it easy for you to get knocked off balance. Flex your knees comfortably so you're in position to jump as soon as you have the ball.









Keep your stance in mind as you learn the art of shooting and begin to practice. Once you find the stance that suits you best, use it every single time. The goal is to get so used to the stance that you don't have to think about it before your feet take the right position to let a great shot fly. 


, Your power mostly comes from your turn and your shoulders being relaxed. Your shot will be much less accurate and fluid if you try to fling the ball forward using power in your chest and arms. Practice jumping from 0 to 90 degrees without the ball to practice your turn. Make sure you are jumping forward and that your shoulders are back and relaxed.








, The ball and your shooting eye should form a straight line to the basket.








, When someone passes you the ball, dip it to your waist or thigh. If you catch a bounce pass or another low pass, or are shooting off the dribble, you don't need to dip, as you are already in a dipping motion.








, Position your shooting hand so that your fingertips are perpendicular to the seams in the ball.This hand is responsible for launching the ball. Place your non-shooting hand on the side of the ball to act as a guide for the shot. Your palm may or may not be touching the ball while you’re preparing to shoot - you may have control of the ball with your fingers and thumb.


Leave a little space between your palm and the ball, so the ball will be able to roll off your fingertips with ease. The ball should sit on your finger pads. Spread your fingers wide so you have greater control over the ball.

, If you want the ball to go into the net, then you need to look at the net. If you’re planning to bank the ball in off the backboard, then look at the spot on the backboard you want to hit. Your eyes are an incredibly important part of a good shot in basketball. Once you release, you may either follow the flight of the ball (which is common among great NBA shooters) or continue to look at the rim., Use your legs to help propel the ball by jumping upward while your shooting hand launches the ball and your shoulders lean back. Move your legs, torso, and arms together in a coordinated fashion to take the shot.








, Your feet shouldn't land in the same position where they started because it will cause a lot of tension in your neck and shoulders. Jumping forward will also give your ball more arc.









Don't lean forward as you jump. If your body is balanced, you should jump in a natural motion, it will cause your shot to be balanced and relieve tension.


, As your hips rise up and you start your jumping motion, move the ball in a smooth motion from your dip to eye level. It should all be one smooth motion. Your hips rise as your elbow rises with the ball, and you should turn anywhere from 20-90 degrees towards your off hand.









Don't let the ball go behind your head or off to the side. Shoot it in a fluid, forward motion. Your non-shooting hand serves only to guide the ball and to keep it steady while your shooting hand exerts force.

, Just before you reach the height of your jump, release the ball, with your shooting hand aimed at the basket. Straighten your elbow and push your wrist so that the ball arches, rather than moving toward the basket in a straight line. As you release the ball, your guiding hand should move to lightly touch your shooting arm just below the wrist. 








Roll the ball off your fingertips toward the basket. You can tell whether you shot it properly by looking at the backspin; if the lines of the basketball spin symmetrically, you positioned the ball properly.

, This is a hugely important part of shooting a basketball. If you shoot from your wrist without following through the shot won’t be nearly as accurate. When the shot is complete, your shooting hand will resemble the shape of a swan; your arm is arched elegantly toward the basket, with your hand loosely cocked downward and your fingers pointed toward the hoop. This is called follow through.







, It's important to practice shooting as much as you can, so that taking a shot - from the stance and grip to the jump and release - feels natural.


Practice from many angles. Shoot from all sides of the basket and from a variety of distances, using the same form every single time, whether you're shooting from the 3-point line or closer to the basket. However, you should turn more and jump farther forward for a longer shot than a shorter one.

, Free throws, or foul shots, are taken from the free throw line, located 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket. It's a good distance to practice from, and since it's located in front of the backboard behind the basket, the ball will usually bounce back to you and you won't have to chase after it as frequently.








, The backboard can be a useful tool, especially for shots you take close to the basket. Depending on where you are on the court you’ll need to bank the ball off the backboard in different ways. Generally, if you are on the right side of the court you’ll aim for the top right corner of the square on the backboard. If you are on the left side of the court you’ll aim for the top left corner of the square.









Use the backboard when you shoot layups, which are taken off the dribble rather than from a standing position.

, After you're comfortable shooting on your own, get some friends together to have a basketball scrimmage, or join a league so you can play some games. Shooting during the pressure of a game is a little harder than doing it by yourself in your backyard, since you have to catch passes, dodge steals and be aware of the strategy your coach and the other players expect you to employ. However, if you practice the right form and develop good muscle memory, you'll be racking up the points in no time.

,, Position the hoop square so the bottom aligns with this mark and it is in the center left-right. With the pencil, trace around the hoop's square. Remove the hoop.

, Leave about an inch above the top of the backboard so you can see and measure on the 4"" x 4"". Using the yardstick or tape rule, find the middle of the 4"" x 4"" (it won't be exactly at 2"", so measure carefully). Make marks on the 4"" x 4"" above and below the backboard, and line up all the marks so the backboard is centered on the 4"" x 4"".

, Don't put any screws in the area where you traced the hoop's square. Use 4–6 screws, placed evenly up the backboard and 4"" x 4"".

, Remove the hoop. With the power drill and the 1/4"" bit, drill a hole in the middle of each tracing. (Note: The lag screws you are about to put in will mostly miss the 4"" x 4"", so don't worry about that; the lag screws will hold the hoop to the backboard, and the other screws you already put in will hold the backboard to the 4"" x 4"".)

, Repeat for the other three lag screws. Make sure they're tight and the hoop doesn't wobble.

,, One person will hold up the backboard in position, one person will measure the rim height with the tape rule, and one person will mark the 4"" x 4"" with the pencil and yardstick. Climb up the ladder next to the pole, and raise the backboard up alongside the pole until the rim is 10' from the ground. (Place it on one of the ladder's steps and lean it against the pole to help stabilize it. Be careful! It's very top-heavy!) Lay the yardstick across the top of the pole and alongside the 4"" x 4"" and mark the 4"" x 4"" there. This is how far into the hollow pole the 4"" x 4"" will go; you put stops here to keep it in place. Carefully bring the backboard and yourself down.

, (See photo.) Using the exterior screws, screw it to the 4"" x 4"". Repeat for the other three gusset angles, making sure they're all even with each other. Be careful that the screws don't hit each other; you may have to angle them a little bit. The gusset angles make a little shelf to stop the 4"" x 4"" so the rim of the hoop will be at 10'.

, This is the hardest part; the backboard is very top-heavy! Climb the ladder again and carefully raise the backboard up and slide the 4"" x 4"" into the hollow pole.

Stay safe with a low-risk lineup in 50/50 and head-to-head contests.",How to Draft Your Fantasy Football Team in FanDuel App," The first thing you need to do to draft your fantasy football team in the FanDuel app is to make your way to the roster screen. This is a step-by-step affair, with the process starting from the FanDuel home screen and ending up in the roster screen.Starting up the FanDuel app and logging in will lead you to the FanDuel home screen—the lobby, to be specific. Once in the lobby, tap the football league you want to participate in (either the NFL or the CFB.) Doing so will reveal a list of dates and times where the contests will draw their players from.;
, After selecting a date and time, you will be led to another screen asking you what kind of contest you want to join in., There are six types you can select from: featured, league, 50/50, tournament, head to head, or multiplier. These types of contests each have their own rules—rules which will play a very large role in determining the strategy and reasoning behind your FanDuel fantasy football teams. More on this in a later section dedicated to your scoring strategy., Once you pick a contest type, you will then move to a screen where you will select the specific contest you want to join. You can sort these contests by name, by the number of other fantasy managers that have entered in, by the total size of the contest, by the entry fee required to join in the contest, or by the amount of prizes being offered up in the contest., Selecting a specific contest will lead you to a lineup screen where you’ll have to fill out the respective positions of your roster. You need to pick one quarterback (QB), two running backs (RB), three wide receivers (WR), one tight end (TE), one kicker (K), and one defense (D). Each player for each positions will need to be paid a salary, and you’ll be limited to having only $60,000 to fill up all nine positions while staying under the $60k salary cap., Now that you have filled up the slots in your lineup, the next thing you need to do is take advantage of the wealth of player information available on the FanDuel app to further refine your lineup. You can review yards, intercepts, passes and even the latest updates on an individual player’s performance by tapping the portrait of an individual player while on the lineup screen. This will lead you to a separate screen where you can review player statistics at your own time.

Each player has a Fantasy Points per Game (FPPG) score beside their name. Compare their FPPGs to their peers, and you’ll have a general idea of how well that particular player will perform, especially if you can pick up a player with a decent FPPG yet is available for a low salary on FanDuel. Do note, however, to review how the player got his FPPG score. A player that can consistently churn out points across multiple games is good for a high floor lineup, while a player that can hoard lots of points in a few games is good for a high ceiling lineup. , These signify an injury or some other circumstance that could force the player out of the field, and resulting in zero points for your fantasy lineup if that happens. A “P” means that the player is probably going to play despite minor injuries. A “Q” signifies that the player’s injuries are severe enough to make his participation in contests questionable. A “D” means that it will be doubtful that a player will play due to serious injury, and will most likely not play. “NA” means that a player is not going to be active in the season, while an “O” means that the player is out for the season.

Likewise, drop any players who have been marked “IR,” as being in in the injury reserve means that they won’t be able to play for the rest of the season. , An orange text box within the player’s portrait indicates that there’s been an update on the player’s status within the last 24 hours. A gray text box, on the other hand, means that the latest news on that player is beyond 24 hours. Be especially mindful of orange text boxes, as these indicate recent developments that will be useful for gauging how your player will perform in future games., If you like a player enough to consider him for your fantasy lineup, you will want to take an in-depth look at the yards, receptions, interceptions, touchdowns, and other relevant stats he has accrued over his career. To do this, tap the portrait of a player in the lineup screen and tap “Game Log.” This log will show you the stats relevant to the player’s position, as well as the amount of fantasy points he has generated in each game of his career. Use this information to finalize your fantasy football team in the FanDuel app., Now that you know how to draft a roster using the FanDuel app, as well as how to interpret the wealth of information you can access using the FanDuel app, the next thing you need to do is formulate the rationale behind your final lineup. The $60,000 salary cap prevents you from snapping up all of the elite players in your football league, so you’ll have to carefully balance between elite players and less-than-elite players in order to stay within the $60,000 cap. The key here, however, is finding a lineup that is most likely to win the specific contests you want to join.

In selecting your approach to risk, a high ceiling lineup involves investing in players that have the potential to score big when they manage to get a good game going, while a high floor lineup involves investing in players that consistently churn out a predictable number of points in each of their games. These are important concepts to remember when determining the overall strategy of your lineup, especially when you consider the conditions for victory in the contests that you joined., These types of contests will reward those make it to the top or manage to place high in the contest. This means that your lineup needs to score a lot more than most of your opponents in order to win these kinds of contests. You will thus want to formulate a fantasy football team with a high score ceiling. The risky lineups are worth it considering the payouts are immense should your lineups perform well enough to beat the competition away., The victory conditions for these contests involving scoring just enough just to beat your opponent or half of your opponents, since you’ll still win the same amount whether you win by one point or one hundred points. This is why these kinds of contests tend to favor players who pick lineups with high score floors in the long run. A lucky opponent may win against you a few times, but a consistently performing team will win most of the time in these kinds of contests."

This is a critical piece of equipment that will protect your head from injury.






Each helmet will have a face mask, which is typically made of metal that protects the player's face from injury.






Choose a helmet that has a face mask that suits your position. Interior, non ball-handling players, such as offensive and defensive linemen, often use facemasks with plenty of bars, as such positions require intense usage of the hands, which can strike an opposing player in the face without proper protection.






Ball-handling players, such as quarterbacks, running backs, tight ends, and wide receivers tend to use facemasks that have less bars in order to increase their view of the ball and the field.






If you are concerned that a face mask may allow an opposing player's hand to come through, but do not want a face mask that will obstruct your view, consider purchasing a helmet that has a visor, which will protect your eyes while allowing you to see through it. Check with your league's rules before purchasing a tinted visor, as some restrictions may apply.






If purchasing a helmet in the United States, consider purchasing 1 that has a seal from the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE). Such helmets have been tested and are generally considered safer than other helmets.

For example, a place kicker may wear less protective shoulder pads than a linebacker, as a place kicker does not experience physical contact with other players often, while a linebacker experiences much more physical contact.






In general, the more contact you expect during your football experiences, the stronger the padding should be. Check with a qualified sales associate to determine the proper shoulder-pads that you should purchase.







,


If you are playing organized football, your team probably already has jerseys for you to wear.






If you must purchase your own jersey, choose 1 that fits comfortably over your shoulder pads.







,


Football gloves, while not worn by all players, will help protect your hands from minor cuts and scratches and provide warmth during cold weather.






Football gloves often contain adhesives to help with catching and ball control. Check your league's rules to determine which gloves are acceptable.







,


Hip and tail pads will protect your hip and tailbone from injury.






If you plan on experiencing a high amount of physical contact, which you will in most positions, then choose the hip and tail pads that offer the most protection. They should be comfortable, yet offer enough padding to soften hits from other players.







,


The pants should snugly cover the hip and tail pads and should contain thigh and knee pads.






Choose pants that have thick pads for heavy contact positions, which are most positions, and choose pants that have lighter pads for light contact positions, such as place kicker and punter.






While the pants should be snug, make sure you are able to move freely in them.







,


Football socks are specially crafted to keep your feet dry, warm, and insulated.






Choose socks that fit comfortably and match any uniform requirements that your team or league have.







,


Different types of shoes are required for different types of surfaces. For example, you may need more than 1 type of shoe if some games will be played on artificial surfaces and others on grass.






Check with a qualified sales associate for which type of shoe(s) will meet your needs.

Football season starts in late summer.,
Any football player's training schedule involves working out with weights and cardiovascular conditioning.,
Before you start hitting the weights you will need a proper schedule.,
Start off talking about your cardio workout.,
On day 1 of your workout you should work your chest and shoulders.,
On day 2, You should train your upper back and arms.,
Day 3 is the most important because you will be training your lower body.,
To get optimal results from working out, you also need to eat healthy.,
If you follow these guidelines, you should be in pretty good shape by the time the tryouts start.,
Once you get on the line you should get in a 3 or 4-point stance (3 point stance is one hand on the ground 4 point stance is both hands).,
When the ball is snapped that's when you jump the line.,
Now if you get to the ball carrier successfully, just finish him.",How to Become a Good Defensive End," Hopefully you are reading this in about mid winter because you have a lot of training ahead of you. If you are tall, slow toothpick that can't hit, this article can make you a force to be reckoning with. If you are already a good athlete that is quick and strong, that's great but you will still need to train.;
, For this step, joining a gym is a great idea. Most gyms have everything you will need for your training and more. Even if you already have stuff at home, it is strongly recommended that you join a gym. But if you insist on working out at home, you should have a bench press, a treadmill or stationary bike, some dumbbells and a chin-up bar.

, You can't train all your muscles every single day. You will burn yourself out. You need to train a different group of muscles every day. The next few steps show you a pretty good schedule you can follow. If you need help doing any of the workouts, do a Google search on how to do them.

, It needs to be done every day. No matter what muscle you train, you should start off with at least a 20 minute cardio warm up. Try to make it longer as you progress. Your cardio warm up could be running on the treadmill, going for a jog, using the stationary bike or maybe riding a real bike. Make sure you stretch after you are done with your cardio warm up. You should also include a cardio workout after you are done with your weights such as 40-yard sprints, hitting the heavy bag or swimming laps.

, Workouts you can perform to work these muscles are Bench press, Shoulder press, triceps extensions, shrugs Push ups and dips. As a defensive end, you want to get big and gain lots of weight in muscle. So instead of sitting there doing 400 reps of 45 lbs, Pick a heavier weight and do less reps. You should do 3 sets total of about 8 reps. If you get tired and need to lower the weight, that's okay. As far as unweighted exercises go, do 3 sets and lower the amount of reps each time. Be sure to drink lots of water or Gatorade during your workout (Gatorade is still loaded with sugar though. If you can, try Powerade Zero. It tastes just like Gatorade but has little to no sugar)

, Workouts you can do for these muscles are the Row (can be done with cables, barbell or dumbbells), the pull-down, the chin up, Biceps curls and wrist curls. Do the same amount of sets and reps as you would for your first workout.

, Almost every position in football requires strong legs because your legs are where you get your speed and hit charge from. Workouts you can do for your lower body include crunches, The squat, the dead lift, leg lifts, leg extensions, leg curls, The leg press and the calf raise. Do the same amount of reps you would for your other days. You should work out 6 days a week. Try hard not to miss any.

, If you're used to eating junk every day, we're about to change your eating habits. Instead of having sugary cereal and coffee loaded with sugar for breakfast, Try having some egg whites with cheese and some peanut butter on wheat toast with a glass of orange juice. Instead of snacking on potato chips and cookies all day, try snacking on fruit and peanut butter crackers (make sure you get lots of peanut butter it's a great source of protein and helps build bigger muscles). For dinner, make sure you have a lot of meat and get some vegetables in too. Instead of having 3 cans of pop a day, try to drink more water. Try to keep the eating of sweets to a minimum.

, Now lets talk about actually playing the position. As a defensive lineman, your objective is to stir up trouble and stop the offensive plays before they go anywhere. But your job as an end is different from that of a defensive tackle. Tackles are supposed to plug up the central gaps. Ends need to contain the outside of the backfield and stop any ball carrier trying to make it to the outside. Whether its the tailback making a sweep, the quarterback doing a bootleg or someone else, you have to stop them.

, If the defensive secondary calls the correct strength, then you should know which way to shift. Just make sure you are standing a little bit outside of the last guy on the offensive line.

, Do not run straight at the quarterback or else you will leave your containment area open. Try to get to the outside. They will obviously try to stop you if the play is going your way. If the tight end tries to push you inside, do not let him. Fight your way to the outside. If the tight end doesn't get you, A fullback or a pulling guard might try to run you over. Stay low and evade the block and you will get to the ball carrier.

, Hit him low and throw all your strength into the tackle. Wrap him up by the waist, keep your head up and on the side of the ball, and drive until you bring him down. Try your best to push him back. Try not to let him get over you because even if you do tackle him that could mean the difference between 4th and 2 and a touchdown. If you get to the quarterback but he is about to throw the ball, get in his face and pressure him.

Read your gloves’ care instructions.,
Turn your gloves inside out.,
Bag them in a pillowcase.,
Wash in cold water on the delicate cycle.,
Air-dry.",How to Clean Football Gloves2," Keep in mind that a glove’s construction can vary by brand and model. Always check the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding washing. Expect some to be machine-washable, while others should be hand-washed only. If in doubt, always hand-wash., Keep in mind that the outside of a garment experiences a harsher ride through a wash cycle then its inside. Protect the grips to your glove by turning them inside out. Reduce the chance of damage that might come from snags, tears, or wear., Expect top-loading washers to have a rougher cycle than front-loading machines. If your machine loads from the top, protect your gloves further by placing them inside a pillowcase or something similar and then tying it shut. Front-loaders’ cycles should be softer on your gloves, but err on the side of caution if inclined and bag them anyway., Be aware that heat can damage your gloves’ components, depending on the material used. Set the temperature to “cold” for both your wash and rinse cycles. Then select “delicate wash cycle” for the gentlest wash. Add a mild laundry detergent to the washer as it fills., Run your cycle. Once it’s completed, lay the gloves flat on a surface or hang them on a drying rack or clothesline. Don’t use the dryer, since its heat will likely damage the grips and/or other components."
"
Wash sparingly.,
Air them out after each use.,
Soak up smells with absorbent materials.",How to Clean Football Gloves3," Whether you machine- or hand-wash your gloves, expect each wash to add some amount of wear-and-tear to your grips. To lessen the impact of repeated washes, refrain from washing after every single use. Wash once a week or every other week unless they desperately need it., Since you’re not going to be washing them after every single use, don’t ball them up in your bag or locker. Bring them home and hang them up on a clothesline or drying rack so they can breathe. Allow any sweat or other moisture to air-dry with plenty of circulation to keep smells from building., Even if you air your gloves out after each use, expect lingering sweat to start stinking them up at some point. Combat this by stuffing them with materials that will absorb the smell when not in use. Handy household items that can be used include:New tea bags
Dryer sheets
Newspaper

Use the techniques and style of a heads-up block for most blocking scenarios.,
Start in an athletic, powerful three-point stance.,
Use your first step to line your shoulders squarely with the man you're blocking.,
Take a short, powerful step into your opponent as you make contact.,
Drive your palms just inside your opponent's armpits as you make contact.,
Keep your feet moving to ""roll"" your hips into the opponent.,
Push up and forward to drive the opponent backward.,
Keep your feet moving, driving forward until you hear the whistle.",How to Block Well in Football1," This is the most common block in football, and all the rest, from cut-off blocks to trap blocks, stem from these fundamentals. A block has five distinct parts -- the stance, the run-up, the strike, the stick, and the follow-through. These five parts can be used whether you're a lineman or a running back, depending on the play and your coach's instructions., This stance is the base of every block, and how you'll line up on the line before every play. Getting it right is not about looking good -- it is about maximizing speed and power right off the whistle. Remember:


Feet shoulder width apart, up on the balls of your feet, not your heels.
Knees bent and slightly in front of your ankles.
Bent at the waist, never the back. Your spine should form a straight, diagonal line.
Dominant hand on the ground for balance and support. The other hand is low, parallel to the ground.
Eyes up, looking at your target., Your first step is short, using your non-dominant foot (left foot if you're right-footed) to get yourself into position. It should be a roughly 6-inch step, shifting your weight to effectively close off the running lane. You want your shoulders to match up evenly with your opponent's shoulders.


Stay on your toes with every step instead of going flat-footed.
Remember to keep your head up throughout the block, locking your eyes on your opponent.

, Your first step sets up your line, the second drives you into the block. Use your dominant foot for extra power, taking short, 6-inch steps that keep your knees slightly bent and powerful.


Shorter steps are more powerful, and you can get them in much faster than long, loping strides. This is why so many football coaches do ladder and tire drills to increase foot speed., Don't launch forward with your hands already extended. Rather, as you're making contact with that second step, drive your palms right below the shoulder pads, roughly between the numbers and armpits. You want this explosive contact to drive them back.


Your head is still up, not leading with the top of your head into the opponent. This is both dangerous and illegal.

, As you hands make contact, you'll likely be slowed by the resistance of the opposing blocker. Keep your feet moving with short, choppy steps as you bring your hips in closer to the opponent, keeping your knees bent and your butt low for power. Think of moving the hips forwards and upwards as you connect, continuing your contact forward.

, Pushing slightly upward takes the opponent off their feet, lowering their power considerably. This is why, when you rolled your hips under, you kept your knees bent for propulsive power up and out.

, You must keep your block up throughout the play, as you likely don't know what is happening behind you. While you might not be able to drive upfield, keep your feet moving. Drive into the defender to remove him from the play until you hear the whistle.Note-- on a pass play, you don't want to drive all the way up, you want to hold your line to protect the quarterback.

Read and understand the Circball Rules.,
Form two teams with 6 players in each team.,
Acquire the Circball equipment consisting of a cluster ring basket.,
Create a circular court using specifications found at http://www.circball.com.,
Play Circball as a cooperative and competitive game of play.",How to Play Circball," You can download the game rules from the official website: http://www.circball.com

Circball is played with rules similar to basketball from first to the last quarter. New rule elements are introduced during second quarter of the game. Circball is played using the same tactics/ game-play of basketball such as dribbling, passing the ball, shooting the ball, offense, defense, fouls, etc.
There are four periods (12 minutes each) of game play each with timeouts (2 mins.) and overtime periods (12 minutes).
The primary (smaller) ring earns 3 points, the secondary (bigger) ring earns 1 point. (Points are incurred anywhere in the court area).;
,

Each team (a Squad) will have a Captain who will lead the team.
One of players in the team initially wears a bright-colored marker (a headband or a wristband). This identifies the player as a morality player (""giver).
Substitution players are also allowed in each team.
Each player is limited to four personal fouls and can be temporarily disqualified. A disqualified player can return to play the game upon being forgiven by the opposing team.

,

Height of the basket hoop should be no less than 10 feet (3.0 m).

,


The circular court should be around 70 feet (21.3 m) in diameter.
Tarpaulin drawings of a ""weighing scale"", a ""dove"", a ""heart"" and a ""hand"" should be placed north, south, east, west area along the court area boundary, respectively.

,

A Drop Ball Rule initiates the game.

Two opposing players raise the ball with the palm of their hands
Upon signal of the official, they then release the ball,
And at the same time the two players make at least 3 full-steps backward.
The drop ball players will then try to come back and tap the ball with their hands.
The first player to touch the ball has possession.


From the first to the last quarter, the game is played using similar rules of basketball.

Each team plays competitive defense, offense alternately as each team acquires as much points as possible.
When a ball goes into the primary basket, the team earns three (3) points regardless of where the shot is made.
When the ball goes into the secondary basket (the bigger ring to the right of the player making the shot), the team earns one (1) point regardless of where the shot is made.
Rules of basketball such as fouls, throw-ins, boundary rules are also observed.
Beginning with the second to the last quarter, the new rule element, Morality Play, is introduced along with rules of basketball.


As a cooperative game, Circball rules allows a player to give the ball to the opponent team voluntarily, twice during the game (Morality Play).

Starting with the 2nd Quarter, Morality Play rule is performed by a morality player (""giver"") who gives the ball once from the care zone and once from the share zone to the opponent for the opponent player to try for a goal.
The morality player (""giver"") stands at these zone and calls an opponent player by name or number.
The morality player then hands the ball to the selected player or places the ball inside the share zones.
The selected opponent player takes possession of the ball and within 7 seconds try to make a shot at the goal basket, unimpeded. (The normal point system of 3 point/1 point applies). After the morality shot by the opponent player, ball possession is given to the opponent player's team via throw-in.
Giving two balls completes the Morality Play of one player. The player then transfers the brightly colored ""marker"" (a headband or wristband) to the next team player and successively until all squad members have done their share of Morality Play.
The first team to complete the Morality Play earns a higher bonus point revealed at the end of the game.


Another cooperative feature of the game is the Human Rights Play rule played at the end of the 4th Quarter.

A team ahead in the total overall score at the ended of the final quarter but whose desire is “to give more and more until it hurts” gives any number of balls voluntarily to the trailing team for them to try to catch up in points.
For example, if Team A overall score is 100 and Team B overall score is 90, Team A will allow Team B to catch up.
All members of Team A will stand inside the red zone
Team B will stand in the green zone (the free throw area) and will receive the balls given by Team A to make a shot at the goal basket.
Team A will give Team B a number of shots of not less than 4 times (in this example)
Team B has a possibility of catching up if they make 3 points each shot 4 times in a row, in this example.
While Team B makes a shot, Team A can make distracting moves (ie, waive, shouts, etc) but not block a player from making a shot.

Develop contacts with current and future professional football players.,
Familiarize yourself with the football agent business.,
Sign players as clients.,
Negotiate contracts for your clients.",How to Become a Football Agent,"


The NFLPA requires all agents to hold an advanced degree, usually in law or business administration. You must earn your degree before you sit for the agents' test.
To earn a law degree, take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) administered by the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC). Apply to law schools, and accept admission to a law program accredited by LSAC. Earn your Juris Doctor degree in 3 years.
To earn a master's degree in business administration (MBA), take the Graduate Management Assessment Test (GMAT) administered by the Graduate Management Admissions Council. Apply to business schools, and accept admission to an MBA program accredited by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Earn your MBA in 2 years.;
,,,,


The agents' exam covers topics such as legal issues surrounding player representation, player sponsorship rights, and the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which regulates player employment with the NFL. Consult the NFLPA application instructions for guidance on what to study.
Around 60 to 70 percent of prospective agents pass the agents' exam. Once you have passed, you are legally permitted to sign clients.

,


Agents tend to sign clients only after having developed personal relationships with players. Approach current NFL players without representation and offer them your services. Consult with recent college graduates who are planning on entering the NFL draft. Be sure to abide by all National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) regulations regarding non-contact between agents and current college players.
The best way to get to know players is through mutual acquaintances. Ask employees of NFL teams or former players for introductions; if you played collegiate football or know players or coaches in any programs, consult them about potential clients.

,


Experienced agents stress that there is no substitute for experience. Because of the particular nature of NFL contracts, no general knowledge from law or business school will help you as a football agent. Work as a junior agent with a large agency (your NFLPA certification qualifies you for this position) or seek employment with an NFL front office, where you will learn about the finances and contracts specific to football.

,


Before earning money from negotiating for players, you need to legally establish yourself as their representation. Use a standard football representation contract, which you can acquire from contacts in the industry.

,


Agents make most of their money from commissions they make on players' contracts with professional teams. The maximum commission allowed by the NFLPA for an NFL contract is 3 percent.

Know your plays inside and out.,
Always keep your feet chopping forward with short, powerful steps.,
Keep your spine straight to avoid injuries and add power.,
Tuck your elbows in, hands rotated slightly outward, for maximum power.,
Use short, powerful approach steps to close the distance on any far-off blocks.,
Keep shoving your hands as you press, wanting nothing more than to see your opponent on the ground.",How to Block Well in Football2," The best blocking technique in the world doesn't mean squat if you don't know who you're blocking. You should know what is required of you in every play and scenario, so spend some time doing your homework. If you have questions, ask your coaches -- don't wait until game time to get the plays down. Most importantly, know whether it is a running play or passing play:


Running plays are when you drive into the defense to make as big a hole as possible, pushing back hard.
Pass blocking is when you stay on your line and keep the opponent from getting to the quarterback. You must hold position.
On a play-action pass play, there is a fake run, so fire off as if run blocking but don't go down field, holding your line instead., Even if you've got your opponent beat, the blocker that keeps their feet moving is usually the one that wins in the end. Furthermore, you have far more power in your legs than your arms, and your upper body will tire out much faster than your lower over the course of a full game.


Your knees should always be bent while blocking.
Remember -- short, explosive steps off the balls of your feet-- keep moving., One of the biggest and most dangerous blocking mistakes you can make is bending your back, putting excess strain on your spine and greatly lowering power. When crouching, you want to bend from the waist while keeping your spine straight. As you make contact, lean forward from the waist while keeping your back broom-handle straight.


Strong back and core muscles will help you do this, gaining a key advantage over opponents., Keep your elbows close to your ribs as you make contact, as this maximizes the power of your arms. Rotating your arms slightly to the outside should also square your biceps up with the opponent, further increasing power.


To help remember where to place your hands, think of pointing your thumbs straight up to the sky., Not all blocks come right off the line. Sometimes you'll need to move forward to approach your opponent. When doing so, don't just run up like normal. From about 10-12 feet out, drop your hips and take the short, choppy steps of a normal block, staying on the balls of your feet. You should be able to change directions on a dime, trying to line your shoulders up with his as you land the block.


This also applies as a defender is rushing towards you. Use your short steps to keep your shoulders square to his, then drive forward as he makes contact with you.
Running directly at someone is the best way to get faked out, as you can't change direction fast enough to react., You should want to physically dominate every single opponent that crosses your path. Don't neglect the mental portion of the game -- the most ruthless and aggressive blocker will always have the advantage. Short of holding or grabbing a jersey, use your hands to manhandle your opponent into submission.


Once you've made contact, your hands don't have to stop. Violent, short pushes and shoves can knock them off their feet and help you drive through."
"
Use a blocking sled to mimic game-like motions.,
Use squats to gain the explosive lower-body power needed for success.,
Use medicine ball training to build explosive upper body strength.,
Build a powerful chest with bench presses, push-ups, and chest flies.,
Develop back and core strength with pull-ups, rows, and deadlifts.,
Focus on your abs and core at least twice a week for better form and power.,
Keep any conditioning short and sprint-based, not jogging.",How to Block Well in Football3," The best way to become a stronger blocker is to block. While you cannot only block without ever going to the gym, regular blocking exercises must be a part of your workouts. For an added challenge, have people stand on the back of the sled to add weight.


Always focus on your form when practicing. The better it is in practice, the better it will be in a game.

, Squatting closely mimics the act of pressing up and out on a defender, making it an essential exercise for any blocker. Regular squats are important, but there are also blocker-specific variations that you can use once a week to mix things up:



Paused-Front Squat: Using a lower weight than normal, set up for a normal squat. As you lower, hold the bottom position for three seconds. Then explode upwards with the weight.

Dead-Stop Squat: Lower the bar's starting position so that your thighs are slightly higher than parallel to the ground. Get ready under the bar, then simply explode upward. Slowly lower it back to the bar, resting it completely, to finish one rep., Medicine balls, especially those that bounce, are an excellent way to build game-like power in the gym. Start each exercise in a squat position, keeping your knees bent and over your ankles, to mimic your game posture. You can then try:



Medicine Ball Leaps: Launch yourself forward from the squat, throwing the ball directly in front of you as you do. Try to mimic the feeling of exploding into a defender while shoving your arms out for the best results. Land, pickup the ball and repeat.

Repeated Throws: Standing near a wall in squat position, throw the ball into the wall so that it bounces back to your chest. Keep your lower body still the entire time, stringing together as many throws and catches as you can., Your chest muscles activate when you push your arms in front of you, making their usefulness in blocking obviously. Bench pressing and push-ups are the most common and useful exercises, but not the only ones. You should dedicate 2-3 days a week to a strong chest.


Use incline and decline presses to work different areas of your chest muscles.
Try ""plyometric pushups,"" where you must jump off the ground with your hands and clap in front of your face, for truly explosive power., A strong back isn't always noticeable, but it adds serious power throughout your block by keeping you upright, strong, and dense. No matter what exercises your prefer, the following three compound exercises are essential for unbeatable blockers.


Pull-ups
Seated or Standing Rows
Deadlifts.

, Your core helps you keep your back strong and straight. Furthermore, you transfer power from your legs to your upper body through your core, and strong central muscles make all of your movements more efficient. Try out:


Planks/Bridges
Sit-ups
Crunches
Leg lifts.

, Jogging is nothing by a cool-down or warm-up for you. You don't jog on the field as a blocker, you do make tons of short, high-intensity sprints. You should train this way as well. Try out:


Ladder or tire drills that require quick feet for a short amount of time.
10-20 yard sprints, resting for only 30 seconds between each.
Position sprints -- line up against a bag, or no one, and then ""block"" for 5 seconds. Then turn and sprint downfield for 10 yards as if you were following a play."

College football coaches (and NFL recruiters) are more likely to take note if you do well in high school football. Recruiting can start as early as freshman or sophomore year, so try out as early as possible.If your high school does not have a football team, transfer to one that does or join a club team. High school teams are highly preferable.
Getting your high school diploma is a requirement for playing on the NFL, so study hard and plan to graduate.;
, Sports camps are a great way to connect with and get noticed by university coaches. A coach may be more likely to remember your name if you spend time training with them at sports camps. Spend time with the players and get your name out there: think of your football camp experience as early networking. This is your chance to make a first impression., Tell your football coach you want to apply for college football so they can support you however possible. When making your list, separate it into three sections: list your dream schools, schools you could realistically plan for, and schools to fall back on.

Ask your coach to be honest with you about your skill set so you can make a helpful list.
Once you have a list of schools, research them. Check out the school's athletic website and read up on current and former players, as well as their recruiting process.

, Recruiting videos are important for catching the attention of college coaches. Compile a play-by-play video of your best in-game moments. Make sure each play highlights your athletic ability.Quality matters. Record your highlight video on a good camera, and consider hiring a professional videographer.
If you're on a budget and must tape it yourself, use a tripod to avoid camera shake., If you want to play college football at a Division I or II school, you need to register with the NCAA Eligibility Center to validate your status as an amateur athlete. Ask your football coach to assist you in registering so you remember to pay any fees and submit required documents.

Because qualified players will need to complete academic work at an American college or university, the NCAA application is currently only available in English., Junior year is the time to make yourself and your abilities known by the college coaches. Write an email or letter to university coaches you're interested in playing for. Send a copy (or a link) of your highlights video along with a resume with details like your stats, academic data, honors, and your coach's contact information.

You can also call the university coaches so you can personally get to know them. Avoid having your parents call potential universities, as this is considered unprofessional.

, By your senior year, university coaches should contact you about potential offers. Decide which offer is in your best interests. What scholarships are these colleges offering? Are the potential schools a Division I or II school?

Division I schools have the largest athletic budgets and travel nationally to play. Division II schools have less budget money and usually travel regionally.Anyone is allowed to enter the NFL draft, as long as they have graduated high school. If you don't play in college, continue training hard and consider becoming a walk-on., College walk-ons are players who either didn't receive an offer in high school or wants to attend a college that does not offer scholarships (like Ivy League universities). Stick your foot in the door with college coaches and ask them how to qualify for a walk-on position. If you have athletic skill, the coach may give you a shot.Most college walk-ons do not receive an athletic scholarship.
Qualified walk-ons need to build good character, strong academics, and a thick skin., If you make it on your college team, you will have assigned practices almost every day. But if you're training for the draft on your own, you'll need to develop diligence on your own. Plan a fitness schedule that keeps your body in shape and pushes you to your physical limits.

Rest days are just as necessary as training days. Work in one day of light activity (like walking or yoga) per week to avoid overexertion., When training, work on your running, jumping, and direction-changing skills. During the NFL draft, you will need to compete in a 40-yard dash. Practice your agility through aerobic exercises, like sprinting, kickboxing, and using cardio machines., Strength training will give you the endurance and power you need to stand out in the NFL draft. Strengthen your core through bench press exercises, squats, and deadlifts. Maintain a good balance of aerobic and anaerobic exercises to give your body optimum balance., Understand your body's deficiencies and focus on them when you're working out. Ask your coach or mentor about where you could improve your skill. Tell them to be honest with you so you have every opportunity to improve before the draft.

For example, if your upper-body strength overpowers your leg strength, focus on lower-body exercises to balance yourself.

, The NFL states that prospective draftees must have graduated high school at least three years before performing in the draft. Use your college football time to build an athletic resume and catch the eyes of NFL coaches.If you do not play college football, register for the draft around your senior year of college.
After you graduate college, your draft eligibility is only good for the year after you graduated (or if four football seasons have passed since you graduated high school).

, Once you are three years past your high school days, register for the draft. You will begin by registering for the Regional Starting Combines, where you will try out among college football players and other individual trainees. Although anyone can apply, the NFL requests that only those with a high level of ability register.If you catch a scout's eye during the athletic drills and measurements, you may be invited to try out at the National Combine.

, Unlike regionals, only about 335 players are invited to try out at nationals every year. This is a chance for you to measure yourself against the best of the best in drills like the 40-yard dash, bench press, and vertical leap. From here, about 250 athletes will make it to the NFL draft.After your physical evaluation, you will also undergo medical examinations to gage your physical, mental, and emotional health.

, During the draft, football scouts will measure you against other players in extensive medical and physical evaluations. The draft consists of seven rounds, with professional football teams picking their new players. During the draft, you can also network with personnel and negotiate for a spot on a team's training roster., The supplemental draft is for those whose eligibility has changed since the draft. Teams can make bids on players, and the team with the highest bid is awarded the player. Professional teams do not have to attend the supplemental drafts, but you never know which coaches and scouts might attend.If you still don't qualify for the NFL, all is not lost. The NFL Transition Assistance Program provides college players with support while they transition to a life beyond football."

Take care of yourself.",How to Be an Excellent Linebacker," Linebackers are expected to rush the quarterback, offer pass coverage, and stop runs. Linebackers must be fast enough to catch receivers yet strong enough to tackle a running back at full speed. A lean, powerful physicality is the core upon which a great linebacker's game is built. If you don't already have an exercise routine, begin one today. The faster you can run and the harder you can hit, the more effective you'll be as a linebacker.


Because the linebacker needs to rapidly move from one defensive role to the next, a solid cardio routine is a must. Jog to build your endurance, but also make sure to run sprints to build the speed you'll need to take down the fastest running backs and receivers.
Strength training is also essential. Linebackers need to be able to go toe-to-toe with immense linemen while rushing the quarterback. Powerful leg, back, and core muscles are highly prized - these muscle groups are the foundation for strong rushing and tackling ability. In addition, a linebacker needs quick, strong arms to fight past linemen and pull ball carriers down. Ray Lewis recommends a robust mix of bench presses, shrugs, squats, and bicep curls.;
, The linebacker's first few seconds of motion can make or break a defensive play. Having a good ready stance is necessary for quick, decisive action as soon as the ball is snapped.


Linebackers use a two-point stance (two feet touching the ground) as opposed to the three or four-point stance used by linemen (two feet plus one or two hands touching the ground, respectively.) Linebackers play a highly mobile role - three and four-point stances are good for linemen who want to dig down and explode into other linemen, but not linebackers, who need to be ready to run.
Keep a wide base. Your feet should be a little more than shoulder width apart, with your toes pointed inwards. This wide, stable base will ensure you're well-balanced and prevent false steps.
Bend your knees to sit back into your stance. Make sure to bend at your waist, not at your back. Keep your chest big and pointed outward. You can rest your arms lightly on your thighs or let them hang loosely, but don't put your hands on your knees, as this encourages you to bend at the back and also takes longer to move out of when the ball is snapped.

, A good linebacker is constantly reading the offense, but a good quarterback is constantly reading you. The first few moments of a play are critical. If you hesitate on your first step or telegraph your intended direction too early, an intelligent offense will be able to exploit your mistake. Be sure to practice the first, critical step you take out of your stance. Your first step should be no more than six inches. Make it in the direction the ball is traveling. Use your first step as a foothold to push off of as you build speed for your play.

, Football players shouldn't set foot on the gridiron without understanding how to safely tackle. Bad form when tackling can lead to concussions or crippling spinal injuries. Don't put yourself (or the ball carrier) at risk - know what you're doing. Tackling can be broken down into three stages: approach, contact, and finish. Each had its own technique to safely maximize your chances of putting the ball carrier on his back.


Approach: Keep a wide stance, keep your head up, and keep your eyes open. Keep on your feet as you begin your tackle.Contact: As you make contact with the ball carrier at his hips or below, thrust your arms up and around him. Grab the cloth of his jersey. Pull the ball carrier toward you as you use the power of your legs and core to bring him down.Finish: Keep your feet moving and keep your center of balance low. ""Run through"" the ball carrier as you continue to pull him down.

, Linebackers aren't just tackling machines - they're frequently called upon to cover receivers. Line up against a quarterback and a receiver, then practice intercepting and swatting down short passes. When the ball's snapped, keep low and shuffle backwards, keeping your shoulders forward and watching the quarterback and receiver. When the receiver passes you, follow him, keeping your body between him and the ball. Stay inside and under the receiver - be a yard or two upfield from him, between the quarterback and him.

, By practicing certain fundamental movements and strategies, a linebacker can begin internalizing his skills. Eventually, a successful linebacker's fundamentals will be committed to muscle memory and he'll be able to position himself to react to offensive threats with maximum speed and efficiency. If you're working with a coach, they will should be able to lead you through a variety of drills to maximize your linebacker potential. Below are just a few great drills for aspiring linebackers.

, This drill improves your reaction speed and allows you to work on your critical first step. Get in your two point stance, and have a friend or coach stand in front of you with the ball. When the drill begins, the coach will move the ball to the left and right at irregular intervals. When the coach moves the ball, make your first six inch step in the direction of the ball's motion as quickly as you can, then return to your stance. Your coach shouldn't follow a pattern - keep things unpredictable.

, These drills improve your ability to recognize and stop a running play. Line up about 5 yards (4.6 m) away from a friend who's a quick runner, facing him while he faces you. Get in your stance. Your friend simulates receiving the ball from a hike, then starts to move to one side (chosen by him at random. Follow him laterally without closing ground on him too quickly. When he's moving slowly, stay in your stance and use a low, shuffling motion to advance on him at a 45 degree angle. Keep your shoulders pointed forward. When he moves quickly, sprint towards the sideline. Always stay about one step behind the runner - you don't want him to cut inside you. Try to force him towards the sideline.

, Similar to above. You'll need another linebacker to practice with you. Useful for practicing plays where you're required to rush the quarterback or stop inside runs. Line up in your stance across from five evenly-spaced drums which will represent the offensive line (each linebacker should be lined up on either side of the middle bag/drum.) The coach will stand behind these and simulate receiving the ball from the snap. He'll then indicate motion to either side with the ball. If the ball moves right, the linebacker on the right will shuffle forward to the right, outside of the offensive line, while the linebacker on the right will fill the hole to the directly to the right of the central bag/drum. When the ball moves left, mirror the motions.

, An offensive lineman's job is to keep you from reaching the quarterback or ball carrier. To do this, they'll grab you, push you, and otherwise manhandle you. Get good at swatting their hands out of the way - if they can't shove or grab you, you'll stand a better chance of getting around them. Stand arm's length from a friend. Keep your hands up in front of your chest with your elbows in - like a boxer who's got his guard up. Have your friend try to grab your chest again and again, gradually increasing his speed. Practice swatting, blocking, or smacking his hands out of the way.


Remember that if you miss his hand with one of your swats, you can try to break his grip with a ""backhand"" motion when you bring your arm back to its ""ready"" position.

, Almost every coach will tell you this. If the coach called a play where you're lined up on the right side of the ball and you see the ball move left, don't cut and run left. Several offensive plays revolve around tricking defensive players into opening up ""holes"" for the offense. If you abandon your post, a quick running back will be able to exploit the hole you've left open for serious yards.


When the ball crosses the line of scrimmage (or is about to), you can pursue it directly.
Three plays that can give the other team a touchdown if you don't stay home: The counter, boot, and reverse. These three plays all involve a fake to one side followed by a ""real"" run to the other.

, The best way to get good at something is simply to start doing it. Athleticism and well-practiced fundamentals aren't useful unless they can be applied to actual in-game situations. If you're already on a team, your coaches should organize scrimmages as an important part of your practice schedule. If not, play football with your friends at the park.


If you don't have enough people to play a full 11-on-11 game, don't fret - you can hone your skills through ""mini-scrimmages."" Simply shrink your teams to incorporate as many people as you have. You might try pairing with one defensive lineman and one safety to take on an offense consisting of one quarterback, one lineman, and one receiver, for instance.
Often, practice games aren't played at ""full-speed."" That is, certain safety measures are taken to ensure no one sustains an injury. For examples, tackles might be made with less force or not at all. Remember that even linebacker Lawrence Taylor, considered one of the best linebackers of all time, occasionally had miss games because of injuries.

, Linebacker is one of the most important defensive positions, if not the most important. Generally, middle linebackers (sometimes called the ""quarterbacks of the defense"") receive calls from the defensive coach and give play calls to the defense on the field. Always ""read"" the offense so that you can make on-the-field changes to the defense. With intelligent, nuanced play-calling, your defense will come to respect and trust you.

, Be the player all the other defensive players want to be. Show up to every practice early. Spend extra time in the weight room. Stay focused and positive. Your team mates will notice.


Keep morale high. Keep your defense focused and ""pumped up."" This is easy at the beginning of the game, but hard when fatigue sets in. Even when you're frustrated by your players, it's generally better to build your defense up than tear it down - there's plenty of time for criticism in the locker room.
Study. Know the defensive playbook inside and out, but also study offensive plays. Watch films of old games with a coach or mentor. Talk with your coaches about writing new plays. The better you understand football's overarching strategy, the better you'll be able to lead your defense to victory.

, As the defensive leader, you'll be responsible for relaying the coach's instructions to the defense on the field. Repeat what he says three or four times in your head. Know every play so that you don't have to ask questions or fill in the gaps in your knowledge with improvisation. Be confident in your play calling, and if you see the offense line up in a way that makes you think your defense won't be effective, call an audible on the field that logically counters the new offensive threat.


One example of a defensive audible: The defense has lined up in a 3-4 formation (three defensive linemen, four linebackers) in preparation for a blitz with both outside linebackers. The offense lines up in ""trips"" formation (three receivers on one side of the field.) The defense might decide on the spot to change the blitz so that one of the middle linebackers and the weak side linebacker (the linebacker lined up on the opposite side as the three receivers) blitz, while the other two linebackers perform pass coverage. This preserves the pressure of the blitz while devoting the strong side linebacker to keeping pressure on the receivers.
If you end up playing iron man football (playing both offense and defense) and you have taken a few hard hits, you may reach a point where your memory is nearly shot. Muscle memory and becomes important at this point.

, Your team counts on you to play your best and to hit as hard as possible. However, keep your sportsmanlike composure. Because of the rough, even violent nature of the position, defensive players sometimes psych themselves up by ""getting angry."" They work up feelings of rage so that they can more doggedly pursue and hit the ball carrier. You can manipulate your own emotions for better results, but do so only to a point. Never lose your composure, even if offensive players aggravate you with their words or behavior.


Remember - if you abuse an offensive player or hit him illegally, you can win your team a personal foul (15 yards and an automatic first down for the offense) and even be ejected from the game. You'll also be setting a terrible example for other defensive players, who may look to you for guidance.

, A linebacker has to be tough as nails, but when he's hurt, he should seek the help he need. Talk to your team's sports medicine professional if you feel any unusual aches or pains. S/he can recommend a regimen of treatments or exercise to get you back in fighting shape. Here are some things you might be required to do:


Ice sore spots and/or injuries
Wear a cast, sling, or other protective gear
Use crutches to keep pressure off of an injured foot or leg
Receive tissue massages
Start a special stretch or exercise program
See a doctor for more drastic treatment options

Decide what type of back you are.,
If you choose to be an elusive back working on your agility would be the best move.,
If you choose to be a power back working on your strength and explosiveness is your best choice.,
Working on your stamina is crucial for any running back, whether you are an elusive back or power back.,
Playing and scrimmaging will help you develop your skills.,
It is important for every running back to familiarize themselves with routes.,
Have fun.",How to Be a Running Back," Are you an elusive back? Or a power back? Now every back has their advantages and disadvantages. For example a power back will be able to break tackles much easier than an elusive back but an elusive back will be less likely to get hit and run a fair amount faster than a power back. Your body and natural abilities should help influence your choice. If you are naturally fast an elusive back would be best for you but if you find you're strong and powerful the power back might be your best choice. However, not everyone fits strictly into one of these categories. If you are about equal in terms of speed and strength, you could be considered a balanced back. If you are the more balanced type, make sure you stay well rounded.;
, Many believe speed is the biggest quality for an elusive back and while speed does make a huge difference, it is second to agility. Working on your agility will allow you to move out of the way of multiple defenders when they're coming at you. You will find most during most rushes you won't reach your top speed instead you will be constantly trying to avoid defenders by changing directions and faking them out. Working on your agility will help make this task a lot easier. With all this said working on your speed is still necessary but not as important as your agility.

, Most power backs are used to run through holes to gain the first down as opposed to running on the outside like an elusive back. Working on your strength and explosiveness will help you take on defenders. Focus a lot of your working out on legs. Most people hear strength and immediately run to the bench press. Although this will help your strength don't spend too much time on it, focus most your workouts on your legs and core.

, Many teams rely on their backs often whether to get the first down or the touchdown you will be running plenty. Running frequently will help you achieve a better stamina level.

, Working out plays a big role in becoming a better running back but practicing is mandatory so you can get the feel of your position for games. With scrimmages you will understand better on what you must do during the game as well as off the game. If you find you are not quick enough during scrimmage chances are you're not going to be quick enough during a game, so you can incorporate exercises for quickness during your workouts.

, Common routes for running backs are sweeps and drives up a hole. A sweep is a running play where the running back receives the ball whether by pitch or hand-off and runs along the line of scrimmage. A drive also referred to as a dive is a play where the running back runs into pockets opened up by linemen. Most power backs will be tasked with a dive play and elusive backs are more likely to be tasked with a sweep

, It sounds cheesy yes but it's most important. If you're not having fun playing then being a running back is probably not for you. You might want to try other positions or a whole new sport in general.

, Make sure if you are in between levels like D-1 and D-1aa you send to both. Once you get that list you must send a physical DVD to those coaches, recruiting coordinators and head coach. Then you must also email the link to all 100 plus other schools you want to recruit you.

,, You must have your coach's endorsement to get recruited, period.

, Make sure you go to the National Underclassmen Combine, Under Armour, 7 on 7 showcases, and get invited to true invite only camps like the Ultimate 100 Camp, Top Prospect Camp, Elite 11, and Nike Camps. All the major recruiting services and college coaches take their information and evaluate performers from those events.

, You must speak well when you follow up, talk to the position or recruiting coordinator each time and see where you stand with the coaches. Do not have your parent call, you must call, it is your future.

, You must be selective, if you can choose the five schools most interested in you. Do not live a pipe dream, choose schools that express heavy interest in you.

, You must send them a video, highlight video of yourself, your information, a high school coach's endorsement.

, Follow and add college coaches to your pages. They cannot necessarily contact you but you can contact them.

, If you are out of shape, you won't do well. Being physically active means being physically fit; here are some factors to consider:


Your diet.







Your amount of exercise.







Being sick.







, Obviously, you need to know how to throw and catch a football. You don't need to be exceptionally well at these, depending on what position you'd like to play, but it allows you to play more positions.

, To achieve the best results, you should consider what you have the most potential to do well in, and then practice to become the best in what you do. Some things you may want to consider are:

Your ability to catch.






Your ability to throw.






Your speed is key.






Your body structure (I.E. Guys with a lot of muscles often play different positions than those who have less. Consider how your body is built.)







, Even off the field, you should be practicing often. Not only does it help you become more fit, but it also allows you to excel at what you do.

, There a plenty of other people who want the same position as you, and if you want to start, you have to be the best. Daily practice of the skills you need is critical. Having an exercise routine is also important.

, If you can't take a hit (or multiple hits) without getting hurt or sad, then football is not for you. You have to be strong.

, This doesn't effect your physical talent, but it can effect the game. A team is nothing without teamwork, and teamwork is hard to achieve when you can't get along with your team mates.

, Prepare well to play, and never think negatively about yourself or your team. Don't just think you're good enough to beat the opposition, know you're good enough to destroy the opposition.

, There is no half speed, no rest period, no ""taking plays off"". You have to be a ""nuclear explosion"" once the ball is snapped and until the whistle blows, if you're not prepared to give that type of maximal effort, you will never be great.

, Follow their advice once you start playing and it will make a big difference in how confidently you play.

, This is an ideal way to develop your skills, as your perspective of the game and tactics are very different when you are an observer rather than a player.

Professional athletes are in top physical condition. Expect to make working out a priority.


Find the physical statistics of a few professional athletes and work hard to match them. Look into the workouts they do and make those exercises part of your routine., Perform exercises such as the bench press and the deadlift. Workout with the heaviest amount of weight you can lift correctly for 5 repetitions.Work the large muscle groups such as the chest, back, quadriceps, and hamstrings., Practice sprinting at increasing intervals. Start with trying to complete two 150-meter sprints in under 20 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds between each sprint.As you build up endurance, increase the length and intensity of the sprints. Try doing three 200-meter sprints in under 30 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds between each run.Make sure you give your body time to recover after each sprint. Rest for 3-5 minutes between each series of sprints.Work on boosting your heart rate and keeping it high for a short amount of time. Playing football requires explosive energy in short busts. Find workouts that mimic that intensity., Training like a professional athlete means eating like one. Since you'll be doing a lot of heavy lifting, make sure you get enough protein. A good guideline is to make protein account for about 1/3 of your plate at each meal.Eat lean proteins such as chicken, fish, and beans. Try to mix in a vegetarian meal once or twice a week. Soy is one of the healthier options for a vegetarian lean protein.Your position will depend on the amount of calories you need to eat. If you need to be light on your feet, aim for 3,000-5,000 calories during training. If you're a lineman, you may end up needing 8,000 calories."

Don’t forget to study up on plays! While a positional coach can get by learning the position, a head coach needs to know offense, defense, and special teams inside and out. Read books and study game film.
Dig deep to find football documentaries that offer insight on coaching, such as those in ESPN’s 30 for 30 series. Popular movies can help too, but keep in mind that movies such as “Remember The Titans” and “The Blind Side” are criticized for placing feel-good messages over historical accuracy.Online reading is always an option. Seek out discussion forums, coaching interviews, and other places where you can meet and benefit from avid fans, former players, and coaches.

, Chances are you're already doing this in some capacity. If you live near a city with a professional team, you can get tickets to the games. If you have a child, you may attend their games. Either opportunity gives you a chance to expose yourself to not only plays, but how people learn. Naturally, as a potential high school coach you want to focus most of all on the high school level, so show up to those games.


While you watch the game, observe how strategy changes on the fly and how the coaches communicate with the players.
Before and after the games, as well as during practices, you will find more opportunities to observe the proceedings and even introduce yourself to the coaches.

, You’re probably shaking your head at this, but the truth is that most high school football coaches are not full-time, single-job coaches. Most high schools don’t have the money to hire coaches, so they depend on other professionals, particularly teachers.Remember that high school coaches play a large role in the lives of their players. Teachers are already familiar with that role and are in the school system, so that’s why teachers are the easiest hire.
A physical education degree is an obvious choice, since gym class and sports go hand in hand, but the subject you teach doesn’t matter. In fact, teachers are more in demand for other subjects than physical education.
This degree is your backup plan, since most schools cannot afford to hire a full-time coach. Check with your local universities for bachelor programs in education.

, This is if you plan on becoming a teacher first. Certificates, if your country has them, permit you to put your teaching degree to use. In order to become a teacher, you’ll have to fulfill the requirements of your state.


In Ohio, for example, after your bachelor’s degree, you have to take a test in both basic skills and your area of expertise, sit in on class lectures, complete an internship, and pass a background check.Potential coaches that already have an unrelated bachelor’s degree should check with their local government for alternative certification that will allow them to work in the classroom while completing additional teaching classes.Take as many physical education and sports science classes that you can, as these will help you understand how to get the best out of your players.

, Medical knowledge is necessary for coaches given that they are the quickest responders on a level where medical staff is limited. In an age when concussions and players collapsing on the field from heart defects has become a headline, coaches more than ever need CPR certification.CPR is cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It involves chest compressions to circulate blood until a person’s stopped heart can be restarted.CPR certification occurs in inexpensive classes from sources such as the Red Cross. Use their website to locate a class near you.

, These can be tough to master, but they’re necessary for a coach who needs to be able to pose as both authority and guidance to players. It is important for you to not only be able to speak with clarity and certainty, but to hold your body in a way that emphasizes what you say.


Know how to carry yourself. Amongst strong teenagers, you’ll need to be able to stand straight, maintain eye contact, speak in an inspiring but forceful way, keep your posture open, and appear genuine.Practice achieving confidence by holding yourself in a mirror and around friends, then move on to giving speeches in a group such as Toastmasters.
Your goal will be to motivate your players, so learn how to think quickly, interweaving life stories into messages you tailor to your audience.
Be sure to listen to your audience and respond to them in a way that shows you heard and understood every word. Coaches need to take feedback and keep everyone on the same page., It’s not enough for a coach to be an effective communicator. As a coach, you’ll need to adjust to being responsible for motivating even the most difficult of teenagers, getting them to give their all both at home and on the field. You’ll need to set examples of decision-making, authority, honesty, and accountability.


Head coaches in particular have to weather the judgment and scrutiny of parents and fans in addition to players and school administrators. Learn to stand by bold decisions.Take a test that informs you of your leadership style, then emphasize your strengths and shore up your weaknesses by reading and practicing in settings such as at work or in a workshop.You can learn these skills in work, particularly as a teacher, but working for nonprofit organizations also provides an opportunity. Also take leadership workshops and online classes.

, In order to land a job as a coach, it helps to know people who can get you in the door. By talking to people, they introduce you to other people who, when hearing your goal, can help lead you there. Hanging around the football field and around coaches themselves will help you not only find a job, but pick up more information on how to be a better coach.


Talking to teachers is a simple way to start. Even if the coach isn’t a teacher, the teachers may know the coach and be able to introduce you.Hang around the athletics office. Make friends with the athletic directors, administrators, weight room managers, and coaches from other sports, as these people all can help you get hired.
Introduce yourself to the football coaches. Some schools may have multiple coaches and multiple tiers of football, such as freshman and varsity. The more time you spend learning and becoming close with the coaches, the more likely they’ll serve as a reference for you finding a coaching job.
Search online, too. Find forums for coaches, former players, and others involved in the sport. These people have the best insight on finding and performing the job, and many still have connections to coaching positions.

, Former high school football players have an advantage, but for everyone else, it isn’t too late to learn. This may however require you to work your way up from the bottom of opportunities that aren’t your end goal, but use this as a chance to learn and build your resumé.Respond to advertisements for coaching jobs. Search your local newspapers and school websites for openings.
In addition to studying game film and playbooks, spend time at the field with coaches and players.

, If your goal is to be the head coach of the program, you’ll need experience to get there. Don’t be afraid to take a job coaching football at the community center, a lower level such as freshman or junior varsity, or other football-related positions to get your foot in the door.


Keep in mind that different levels of the sport require different time commitments and teaching methods. For instance, coaches can work their way up from a Pop Warner (youth) level, building from a level of having to teach proper tackling and breaking strategy down for the youngest set of diversified minds.

, Once you’ve managed to land a position that allows you to hone your coaching skills, you’ll need to perform. A critical step is getting to know the players you’ll be mentoring. Your job means doing what is best for the program, but it also means doing what is best for your players.


Remember why teaching degrees are valuable to high school coaches. Even if you don’t have one, you are still very much a mentor to teenagers going through a vulnerable time in their lives. Prepare to serve as a father figure.
Extra hours come from handling player problems and staying in touch with parents. You have a hand in making sure they pay attention to schoolwork and stay out of legal trouble, in addition to staying physically and mentally healthy.

, Most of this is up to the head coach, but even if you are not one, you are influential in the lives of the players you manage. It’s important for a coach to be able to minimize the risks that most athletes face, such as tardiness, drugs, or law-breaking, by creating a culture where the concept of a team is powerful but not more than the rest of life.


Football is the biggest, most expensive sport in many high schools. Athletes, including ones disaffected in school, abuse their status or find the additional pressure overwhelming.Ensure that your players know there are serious consequences for misbehaving, including losing their position on the team, but allow enough flexibility that they feel able to be honest with you about their problems.
As a coach, you’ll work with players from a variety of backgrounds. You’ll need to provide all of them with respect, treat them all the same, and find ways to help all of them succeed in high school.

, Head coaches run practice, but all coaches have input. The defense requires different training than running backs, so whatever area you are responsible for is the one you have to learn how to improve.


If you’re working with the defense, for instance, you’ll spend additional time working on strength and tackling instead of running or catching the ball.

, There is a lot you can learn from watching professional football, but all levels of football are different. As an educator, you are expected to be able to take strategies and break them down into pieces that your players can understand and inject into the game. Once you can do this, your team will have more success and you’ll win more games.


Examples of books include The Quick Passing Game and The Bunch Attack by Coverdale and Robinson and Football’s Eagle and Stack Defenses by Ron Vanderlinden.
You are very much a student of the game, and you need to pass your enthusiasm onto the players. This not only inspires them to play for you, but your dedication leaves a lasting impression throughout their lives.

Split end. A receiver on the line of scrimmage split one or more steps outside the tackle. The receiver has to be fast and strong enough to break through a jamming opponent at the line and quickly get open for a pass.
Flanker. A receiver behind the line of scrimmage split one or more steps outside the tackle. He has to break through and past opponents at the line The flanker is on the same side as the tight end, lined up just like a split end but a step or two behind the line.
Slot back. He lines up in the backfield between the split end and the tackle.;
, Learn from the pros. Watch how they move and interact with the ball so you can emulate what works for them.








, To be a wide receiver you must be fast and agile. Strength is not usually as important but comes in handy when an opponent tries to tackle you.

, For example, do several 20-yard dashes in succession. Increase your distance to 25 or 30 yards (22.9 or 27.4 m) for several repetitions. You need to be able to run hard many times with only short breaks in between. The faster you move, the more likely it is you'll be able to evade the defense.








, Take jogs and maintain a breathing pattern to prevent cramps.

, Your coach or a teammate can demonstrate each to you.








, As a receiver you'll be catching the ball a lot, so practice catching as much as you can. A simple game of catch is good, but try to hook up with a good passer who can help you run routes and take good passes. A good passer will lead you with the ball (that is, he'll throw to where you will be, not to where you are.)









Develop ""soft"" hands. In other words, provide a ""cushion"" for the ball as it arrives. You don't want the ball to bounce off your hands.
Look at the ball until it's safely in your hands. Looking for an opponent before you have full possession of the ball often results in an incomplete pass.

, Practice every day. If you slack off, it's easy to lose your competitive edge.








, Also known as ""fakes,"" these are designed to fool the opponent. Wide receivers are sometimes called on to appear to run a particular play but then suddenly run something else. In other words, you're called upon to be a good ""actor.""

Get in proper 2-point stance.,
If you are playing up next to the receiver you need to make contact with him, disrupt his route and the timing of the route.,
If you are playing off your man, backpedal within the range of the 20 yards (18.3 m) receiver.,
Once the receiver gets close to you in your backpedal you have to run forward and jump as high as LeBron James.,
If the receiver stops before reaching you in the backpedal you have to close the distance fast.,
Know if you have help over the top - if you have a safety deep you can play in front because you don't have to worry about being beat deep.,
Learn how to tackle properly.,
Follow the play, even if it isn't thrown to your receiver.,
Don't risk jumping for the interception if you are not sure, this can cause the receiver to beat you and possibly get a touchdown.

Always stay inside of the Wide Receiver, because its harder throwing to a Wide Receiver that is behind the cornerback.

,
Read the quarterback and watch where the ball is thrown.

,
in jump ball situations think of yourself as the intended receiver and go for the ball.

",How to Be a Good Cornerback," Your back should be flat and your knees should be moderately bent.;
, After making contact, turn and run with the receiver in cover 1 or cover him in your zone and make your proper drops.

, Keep your shoulder to the outside of the field and level with the yard lines.

, This takes time so you can't wait until he is on you. You need to quickly turn your hips and head to the quarterback and accelerate. Run on the receivers back hip on the inside, that way, if he tries to cut up or in, you are in the way and you disrupt the route and if he cuts outside you can follow.

, You should be accelerating toward the receiver in two steps, first a plant step to stop and a step to push forward.

, If you are in one on one coverage make sure you stay behind or with your assigned man.

, Tackling is a big part of this position; on some teams, tackling is going to be your main task. To tackle you first need to shed the wide receivers block. To do so, get your hands tight inside and get leverage so you move him out of the way to put your self in a position to make a tackle.

, Also be aware of running plays to the outside.

,, Know whether its proper to use man or zone coverage.

, If the wide receiver is lined up close to the sideline then he is not going to run an outside pattern, but is more than likely going to run some sort of inside pattern. His positioning will help you determine the route he will run.

, If it is third and long the receiver is most likely going to run a pattern that should go past the 1st down marker.(At least a good receiver will)

Compare the styles available.",How to Put on an Athletic Cup1," The style of cup protector a man prefers to wear - the banana curved cup or the traditional triangular and flatter shaped cup - is a matter of personal preference. With both styles the testicles fit into the lower part of the cup. With the banana shaped cup, the penis hangs down. With the traditional triangular shaped cup, the penis can be lifted up and placed across the inside top of the protector cup. Some men think a curved cup is more anatomically correct and ultimately more comfortable. Make sure your cup doesn't pinch or anything; if so you will have to get a larger cup.

In order to decrease your chances of injuring yourself while playing a sport, start a regular exercise regimen and get in good shape before the season begins.Use conditioning exercises to help you strengthen the muscles you will use the most for your sport.
Getting a physical before the season starts is a good idea because your doctor can let you know if you are fit enough to play your sport.;
, You should never start playing your sport without warming up first. Warm-up exercises will increase blood flow to your muscles and help increase your flexibility, which makes injuries less likely.Walking briskly or jogging for five to 10 minutes is a great way to warm up.

, Cooling down after your workout is just as important as warming up before. This allows your heart rate to return to normal and prevents the muscles from becoming too stiff.You can cool down the same way you warm up. Walking or jogging for a few minutes is very effective.

, Practicing the same sport every day can greatly increase your risk of overuse injuries, which are caused by repetitive stress to a specific part of the the body. To avoid these kinds of injuries, take some time away from your sport periodically.If you are practicing your sport regularly, take at least one day off each week to give your body a chance to recuperate.
If you practice your sport year-round, take at least one month off each year.
Practicing different sports that challenge different muscle groups can help prevent overuse injuries., Heat-related injuries are an often overlooked risk of playing sports, but they are easy to prevent. Be sure to stay as cool as possible and drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after the game.If you are playing outside in the warm weather, wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun.
Symptoms of heatstroke include dizziness, fatigue, headache, confusion, nausea, paleness, weakness, weak pulse, and heavy sweating. If you experience any of these, stop playing the sport immediately, move to a cool area, and drink water. You may need medical attention if your symptoms do not go away after a few minutes.

, When participating in sports, depending on the type of sport, there may be increased demands put on the body when it comes to nutrition. For example, strength training sports may require more protein intake, while endurance sports may require more carbohydrates. It’s best to talk to a nutritionist or dietitian to assess the right recommended nutritional requirements to maintain proper intensity in your sport.

, Each sport requires that your body move with the right patterns — some sports require you to quickly change direction, others might require you to swing a bat. If certain muscles are not being activated, or are tight, this can lead to stresses in other areas, like the joints. Over time, there is a risk of increased injury. You may want to get a Functional Movement Screen by a certified trainer or coach to assess any limitations. Movement screens in the preseason have been shown to predict the risk of injury.Proper movement screens assess for tightness and limitations in range of motion. The trainer may, for instance, have you perform a squat or lunge and check your form and balance for signs of tightness or limitations.

, While you may be tempted to focus all of your energy on building your strength and endurance, it's important to focus on flexibility as well. Incorporating stretches into your regular exercise routine will help protect you from injury.Stretching can also help you improve your range of motion, which can make you a better athlete, so it has multiple benefits.
When deciding what stretches you should do, think about the injuries that are most common for people who play your sport, and focus your stretches on those muscle groups.
Also consider which muscles are tight on your body. Tight muscles are more susceptible to injury, so work on increasing their flexibility.No matter what sport you play, be sure to stretch the major muscle groups, which include the calves, thighs, hips, low back, neck, and shoulders.
If stretching hurts, back off right away. You should never push yourself past the pain, as you are likely to cause an injury.

, Do some dynamic stretches (stretches that involve movement) before your game. These will help increase your flexibility.Arm circles and hip rotations are good examples of dynamic stretches.
Remember not to start stretching until after you have warmed up your muscles.
Doing a little yoga or tai chi can also help you stretch before you play, as these practices both focus on dynamic stretches., Static stretches (stretches that involve holding a pose for several seconds) should be done after you cool down, never before your workout. These stretches help prevent your muscles from becoming too tense after your workout.Forward bends and folds are great examples of static stretches.
Hold each pose for up to 30 seconds for the best results.

, Each sport has a specific set of rules that are designed to protect players from injury. If you are playing on a school team or in a league, there may be additional rules. For example, some football teams permit tackling, while others do not. No matter what the rules are, be sure you understand and follow them at all times.Rules typically prohibit dangerous maneuvers, such as headfirst sliding in baseball or checking in hockey. You risk not only getting injured if you disobey the rules, but also being penalized.

, Injuries are much more likely to happen if you do not use the proper technique for your sport. If you are unsure what the proper technique is, consult with a coach or personal trainer.This applies to training as well as to playing sports. It is quite easy to injure yourself while working out if you have bad form.

, Whether you are playing a sport competitively or just casually with some friends, you should always wear the proper protective gear for your sport. Each sport is different and has its own risks, so ask a coach or do research online if you are not sure what equipment you should be using.Helmets are important for protecting your head while playing sports that involve physical contact or may cause falls, including football, hockey, skateboarding, and cycling.
Cleats are special shoes that prevent falls when running on turf, and should be used when you are playing sports like football, soccer, and baseball.
Some sports also require that you wear protective gear on your eyes, mouth, arms, and legs.
Inspect all of your equipment for defects before using it.
While pads and helmets may not be the most fashionable accessories, they are designed to protect the fragile body, so don't take any risks by not wearing them.

, You may be committed to your sport and not want to stop until the game is over, but sometimes it's best to slow it down to prevent injuries. Always listen to your body and be willing to take a break when you need to.


Give yourself a break when you're feeling fatigued. Injuries are more likely to occur when your muscles are fatigued.If you feel pain, stop the activity you are doing right away.If you do sustain an injury, don't go back to playing your sport until you are fully healed. Even if you feel a lot better, you may cause more harm if you push yourself too hard before your body has had the chance to recover from the injury entirely."

Wear clothing and equipment that fits properly.,
Switch to lightweight, loose-fitting fabrics.,
Change your clothes immediately after practices and games.,
Avoid storing sports gear in moist, damp environments that lack air flow.,
Wash all sports gear, equipment, and clothing after every use.,
Shower immediately following your sports event or workout.,
Avoid wearing cologne or perfume on days of sporting events.,
Stop using skin treatments that contain alcohol.,
Switch to using a different brand of sunscreen.,
Remove all makeup from your skin prior to sporting events.,
Avoid touching your face when playing sports.,

Understand the relationship between acne and physical activity.,
Identify your acne problem areas.,
Use cleansers and spot treatments with acne-fighting ingredients.,
Consult with your dermatologist or healthcare provider if acne persists.",How to Prevent Acne when You Play Sports," Tight sports clothing such as sports bras, compression shorts, and jockstraps cause a type of acne known as acne mechanica, which occurs when skin becomes irritated due to a combination of sweat and friction. When wearing these garments, make sure they fit comfortably instead of feeling restrictive.


You should also make sure equipment is snug enough to do its job. For instance, a snug helmet is actually better than a loose one, since a helmet that moves around will create more friction and acne.
Remove sports equipment with tight straps during breaks in play. Football helmets and other sports equipment with straps can cause friction and irritation, even when properly sized, resulting in acne. By removing these pieces of equipment while taking a break, you give your skin a break, as well.;
, Cottons and other breezy natural fabrics are usually good, as are synthetics specially made for athletics, since these are often designed to wick away sweat and moisture. Most major sports clothing brands now offer moisture-wicking fabrics that keep your skin dry and comfortable for the duration of sports games and workouts.


Stop wearing heavy fabrics that retain moisture, and avoid synthetics that aren’t designed with athletics in mind, especially lycra or nylon. These can trap moisture against your skin and create the perfect breeding grounds for acne-causing bacteria. , Never stay in your dirty clothes for longer than necessary after you work up a sweat. It’s best to change into a fresh set of clothing immediately after your practice or game--even if there’s a post-victory celebration going on afterward that everyone else is wearing their uniforms to.


If a fresh set of clothes is unavailable, you could change into whatever clothes you were wearing prior to changing into your uniform for the game.
You should also shower before changing, but if you don’t have time, at least blot-dry yourself with a clean towel or wipe yourself down with acne-fighting, medicated wipes.

, Storing gear in environments that lack air circulation promotes the development of mold, mildew, and bacteria, and these contaminants make you more likely to break out when they come into contact with your skin.


Remove sports gear from your locker or gym bag following sporting events so equipment can fully dry and air out. Once everything is dry--and preferably clean, as well--you can return these items to their normal storage spaces.

, This cuts down on the amount of bacteria that accumulates on dirty gear and clothing that contributes to the development of acne. Use disinfectant wipes to clean the inside of your baseball or football helmet after every game, and wash your uniform after every use, especially when you know you did a lot of sweating in it., This removes all traces of bacteria and sweat from your skin so you can avoid clogged pores, which otherwise contribute to acne. An ordinary body wash will usually suffice, but if you generally have significant problems with acne, consider using a medicated acne-fighting body wash instead.Always blot yourself dry instead of wiping your skin down. Wiping can aggravate your skin, causing glands to produce more pore-clogging oils and sweat.
Change into a fresh set of clothing if showering immediately isn’t possible. This prevents you from having to spend excess time in wet, sweaty clothing before you can make it to the nearest shower facility. It’s also a good idea to wipe yourself down with medicated anti-acne to give your skin a quick cleanse.

, These substances often contain synthetic ingredients that clog pores and encourage the development of acne.


Shower products containing artificial scents and colors can have a similarly damaging effect, so it's best to stick with fragrance-free options when cleansing yourself before and after a game.

, Astringents and alcohol-based products can worsen acne by removing your skin’s essential oils that help maintain pH balance and combat bacteria. Similarly, mentholated treatments can actually strip your skin of healthy oils, too, and scrubs can cause small tears and spread bacteria., If sunscreen is the culprit behind acne problems, switch to using an oil-free brand made specifically for athletes. An oil-free version should provide you with the protection you need from the sun without clogging your pores and contributing to the cause of acne.


While you should consider switching your sunscreen, you should not completely skip sunscreen altogether. Sunburns can irritate your skin, causing more acne, and may cause worse damage beyond that. Always apply at least an SPF 15 sunscreen to all exposed skin--including body and face--before playing and outdoor sport.

, If you normally wear makeup, you should skip it whenever you plan on playing sports. Makeup that gets applied directly to the pores on your skin such as liquid foundation, powder, and blush can trap sweat and bacteria, and lead to acne.


If you don’t want to go the entire day without makeup, pack some makeup removal wipes in your athletic bag and quickly wipe any cosmetics off your face before heading out to the playing field or court. As a bonus, you can also use these wipes again to quickly cleanse your facial pores after you finish playing and before taking a shower or washing your face.

, Touching your face to wipe away sweat and dirt transfers bacteria from your hands onto your face, and triggers acne.


Use a clean towel to blot and wipe away sweat, or wear a bandana or moisture-wicking hat to prevent sweat from dripping down your face and clogging pores during sporting events.

, Ideally, you’ll already be showering after your games and practices, in which case, washing your face when you shower should be enough. Even if you’re skipping the shower, though, you should still make sure you wash your face to remove any sweat that’s built up on your forehead (beneath your helmet) or elsewhere.


Remember that makeup removal wipes can help even after your activity, especially if they’re medicated, but washing your face with an anti-acne facial cleanser is still your best option.
Consider also applying a light, oil-free facial moisturizer after washing your face. The moisturizer should soothe your pores and limit irritation, which will also reduce sweat production.

, Sports-related acne is typically acne mechanica, or friction acne, which occurs when friction caused by clothes and equipment irritates the skin, causing more oil and grime to clog your pores.


Friction acne typically occurs where tight clothing and equipment sit. That’s why properly fitting, clean clothing and equipment are so important, and it’s also why thorough cleansing of the skin is important, too.
You can also get sports acne due to heat, allergies to elastic, and normal sweating attributed to increased physical activity. The same things that help prevent friction acne (loose clothing, adequate washing, etc.) should also help acne caused by these issues.

, This helps determine the source of your acne, and how you can change your current routine to avoid acne. For example, if acne develops on your forehead, a tight or dirty hat may be to blame, while acne across your buttocks can indicate too-tight compression underwear that traps sweat and bacteria.


Evaluate where your problem areas are and focus your efforts there. Note, however, that you should still practice overall good hygiene to prevent acne problems from eventually developing in other areas, as well.

, Products containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or tea tree oil can be especially helpful.


If you have sensitive facial skin and are unable to use benzoyl peroxide on your face, you might still be able to use these products on the rest of your body since the skin there tends to be thicker than on your face. Simply apply a small amount on acne covering unbroken skin, but avoid applying benzoyl peroxide where the skin is cut or scratched.

, Your healthcare provider can determine whether acne is originating from sports play or another underlying cause, and recommend the necessary course of treatment.

Score a goal when the entire ball passes completely over the goal line.,
Restart play after a goal only once both teams are in their own half.,
Play four separate 8-minute quarters, switching sides after the first two.",How to Play Water Polo1," The object of water polo is identical to soccer -- put the ball into the opposing team's goals to score, and the team with more goals wins. In regulation games, a goal is .9 meters (3 ft) tall and 3 meters wide, but you can use whatever you have around to make a good net.


No player should be able to touch the bottom of the pool.
Don't have goals and want to play a casual game? You can turn over trashcans instead and play without a goalie.
Regulation pools are 25–30 meters (82–98 ft) long and 17-20 meters wide. They should be about 2 meters (7 ft) deep.;
, In regulation games, teams each have seven players -- six attackers and one goalie. However, depending on your level of competition and the size of the pool, the most important thing is to have an even number of players on each team.In order to know who is on what team, players usually wear matching swim caps. Goalies typically each wear a separate color from both teams.
If you have more than 14 people playing it is a good idea to have substitutes. Water polo is very tiring.
If you're just playing for fun and have an odd number of players, you can make one player ""always offense."" They simply play for the team that currently has the ball.

, The game starts with a swim-off, where the two teams swim to get the ball and start the attack. In regulation games a machine or referee drops the ball in the center, but you can just as easily leave a ball in the center of the pool and say ""go!"" The team that gets the ball first is on offense first.

, Using both hands at the same time is a foul. The only exception to this is for the goalie, who can use both hands within a 5-meter area of the goal. If the keeper swims forward to join the attack, they too must only use one hand at a time.


This rule is to prevent clutching or holding the ball for insanely long periods, making it impossible for the other team to win it back.

, Because you can't foul people to get the ball, one team could theoretically score one goal then hold onto it for the rest of the game. This is why water polo has a 30-second shot clock that starts as soon as a team gets the ball. If a team does not score or reset the clock in 30 seconds, the defensive team gets the ball for a free throw where it currently sits. The shot clock only resets when:


The defensive team gets clear control of the ball.
The offense scores.
There is a major foul., Water polo is an incredibly physical game, both above the water and below it, but almost all player-to-player contact is a foul. You can, however, go for the ball, knocking it out of a player's hands to regain possession. If you hit the ball out or the player uses two hands to protect it, the ball is yours.


You cannot touch or impede players without the ball.
You cannot hold the ball underwater to avoid getting it taken.
You cannot grab, kick, or push a player while ignoring the ball., The 2-meter line is marked by red lines on the sides of professional pools, and offensive players cannot cross this line unless they are carrying the ball. You cannot receive a pass if you're already past this mark, either -- you must have the ball as you cross it, or you can't cross it at all.


The goalie, of course, can be within the 2-meter line without the ball.
For less serious games, remember that 2 meters (6.6 ft) is roughly the height of an average adult male. Stay this far from goal if playing a casual game.

, This is similar to soccer, but with one catch -- a missed shot can deflect off a defender and still be the defense's ball. However, if a goalkeeper deflects a ball away from goal and over the end line, the offense gets a corner throw.



""Goal Throw:' If the offense misses or deflects a shot off of a defender, not the goalie, the defensive teams gets a free throw anywhere behind the 2-meter line.
'Corner Throw: If the goalie deflects the ball out, or a defender intentionally throws the ball behind their own goal, the offense gets a free pass from the edge of the pool at the 2-meter line., This means that the whole ball passes by both posts. It does not need to hit the back of the net in order to score. In regulation games, this scoring line is marked by an all white goal line., Once a team scores, they must return to their half of the pool before the game can start again. The goalie who was scored on can then pass from their goal to a teammate, restarting the game. The shot clock starts once this first pass is made., This is the regulation length of a game, so you can adjust it to your liking if you're just playing for fun. In general, there are 2-minute breaks between each quarter, with 10 minutes for halftime between the second and third quarters.


Younger age groups usually play 5-6 minute quarters.
The clock stops after a major foul (exclusion) or a goal and only starts again when the ball is back in play."

Decide on an order of play.,
Let the first player invent a challenge shot.,
Give the next player the ball.,
Keep playing with the same rules.,
Get a letter when you fail a challenge.,
Invent a new challenge if everyone succeeds.,
Play until there's one person left.",How to Play Horse (the Basketball Game)," You can play Horse with two or more players. Just agree on an order for who plays first, then second, and so on.









If you can't decide, take turns shooting from the same spot. Whoever gets the most baskets in a row goes first, followed by second place, and so on.;
, The first player takes a shot from anywhere on the court — or even outside the bounds! He can add ""extra rules"" to this shot too, but he has to announce them before shooting. For example, he can say ""I'm shooting with my eyes closed"" or ""I'm shooting behind my back."" He gets one try to make the basket.








, The second player gets to take the next shot. This part depends on whether the last shot was successful:










If the first player made a basket: the second player has to copy whatever the first player did, including where he was standing.

If the first player missed the basket: the second player can shoot from anywhere, using any rules she wants to invent.

, Whenever it's your turn, if the person before you made a basket, you have to copy them. If the person before you missed, it's your turn to invent a new challenge.









After the last player shoots, it's the first player's turn again.

, If you are trying to copy the person before you and you miss the basket, you get the letter H. Each time you make this mistake, you get a new letter, spelling out H—O—R—S—E. When you spell out the full ""HORSE,"" you lose the game.









You can't get a letter while you are inventing a challenge. If you miss the basket, play just passes to the next player with no penalty.

, If you invent a challenge, and every other player successfully makes the basket, you get to invent a new challenge.








, When someone gets a ""HORSE,"" he leaves the game. The other players keep playing, skipping his turn. Keep playing until there's one winner left in the game.

Draw a circle on the ground to make your court.,
Relocate the completed tether ball pole to the center of the circle.,
Draw a line through the center of the circle, separating it into two halves.,
Play tetherball.",How to Make a Tether Ball Court," Weld two 10-inch (25 cm) pieces of steel rebar together in a cross formation. This will serve as the base for the tetherball pole and will be cemented into a tire.Be sure to measure the rebar carefully; the crossbar won’t fit inside the tire otherwise.;
, Weld a 10-foot (3 meter) long piece of 2-inch (5 cm) pipe vertically to the center of the welded cross bars.


Alternatively, you can drill holes in the pipe and use 16.5 gauge rebar tie wire to secure the steel rebar to the pole., Weld an eye bolt about 2 in (5 cm) from the top of the vertical pole. This bolt will hold the cord that is attached to the ball.


Alternatively, drill a hole at the top of the pole using a ⅜ in (9.5 mm) drill bit. Attach a washer and ¼ in (6.4 mm) by 2 in (5 cm) eye bolt. Secure the bolt on the inside of the pole with one washer and a ⅜ in (9.5 mm) nut., Place the bottom crossbar stand of the tether ball pole inside a used tire. Place a heavy-duty garbage bag under the tire to prevent the concrete from seeping out.

, Mix concrete well, per its label instructions, and fill the tire with wet concrete, cementing the tether ball pole firmly in place.Use a level to make sure your pole is completely vertical.
Use wire to attach your pole to a ladder or other tall structure to ensure it stays in place while the concrete is drying.

, You will typically need to dry the cement overnight, but check the manufacturer's label for specific instructions.Remove the garbage bag from the bottom of the tire once the concrete is dry.

, Then, attach the other end of the cord or rope to the eye bolt. Make sure your knots are secure so neither the cord nor the ball comes loose.Some tetherballs come with a cord attached; if this is the case, use that instead of the rope.

, Select an appropriate play area, free of obstruction and on level ground. You can choose a grassy location, or somewhere that is paved, such as a driveway.

, The circle should be approximately 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. Use spray paint to draw the circle on grass or dirt. Use chalk to draw the circle on cement., Carefully maneuver the tire so that it lays on its side. Then roll the tire to the area you wish to play and stand it up so the pole is vertical.

, The line should intersect the tetherball pole's midpoint. This line determines the area of play for each player., Now you are ready to play the game. Choose two players and alternate hitting the ball to each other. One person hits the ball clockwise, while the other person hits it counterclockwise. The object of the game is to wrap the rope or cord entirely around the pole."

Understand the three categories of fouls and their consequences.,
Restart ordinary fouls with a free throw at the spot of the foul.,
Sit players for 20 seconds, with their team playing a man down, for exclusion fouls.,
Grant penalty shots for fouls within the offensive 5-meter line or very rough fouls.,
Play a player down for four minutes if charged with a brutality.,
Leave the game if you're called for three major fouls.,
Understand that a ref can call ""advantage"" if it is better to keep playing than take a foul.",How to Play Water Polo2," Fouls in water polo are a mixture of basketball and hockey rules, and they range from minor fouls to ""brutality"" fouls that cause a permanent ejection from the game. Each foul is detailed, along with the referee's reaction and signal, below:



Ordinary Fouls: Referee blows the whistle once and points in the direction the team is attacking towards. Restart is a free throw from the location of the foul. Two whistles indicate that the offense, not the defense, caused the foul.Exclusions (Major Fouls): Referee blows the whistle twice quickly, then one long blast. They spin their arms to indicate a player must leave, and the fouling player must swim to the edge of the pool for 20 seconds, and play starts with a free throw.

Penalty Fouls: Referee blows the whistle three times, like above, then raises 5 fingers above his/her head. The fouler leaves the field and play starts with a free shot on the 5-meter line for the fouled team., These are also called minor fouls. Ordinary fouls are not counted or used against players, and the clock does not stop after they are called. They are by far the most common fouls in water polo, and include:


Touching the ball with two hands
Touching the bottom of the pool
Holding the ball underwater to prevent stealing
Impeding, or getting in the way of players who don't have the ball to prevent them from moving.
Letting the shot clock expire
Throwing a ball outside of the pool., These are also called major fouls and are for more serious and aggressive conduct. Once called, the fouling player must immediately swim to a designated zone in front of their bench, usually the halfway line. After 20 seconds or a goal is scored, whichever is first, they can swim back in and resume play. Exclusions fouls are for:


Pulling, holding, or sinking players without the ball.
Splashing water in a player's face
Blocking a shot with two arms
Kicking or hitting another player violently.
Disrespecting the game or referee (swearing, leaving the pool and getting back in, spitting)

, The foul must be within the 5-meter line, as well as preventing a ""probable goal."" Any foul, if it takes away a probable goal, can be a penalty foul. Your team gets the ball at the 5-meter line against the goalie, and play resumes after the shot.


Very violent fouls, called ""brutality,"" can result in a penalty shot regardless of where in the pool the foul was committed.
Most penalty fouls are called when a defender fouls a shooting player from behind.
The goalie must be completely within the goal for the shot, not in front of it., These are for excessive or violent fouls, like kicking, striking, or extreme language or unsportsmanlike conduct. You must leave for the remainder of the game, and your team will play a man down for four minutes.


If a penalty foul is called for a brutality, the team who was fouled gets the ball back at the half line after shooting, even if they scored.
A strike that is determined as deliberate is the most common brutality called., If you receive three exclusion calls against you, you are out for the remainder of the game. Unless the final foul was considered a brutality, your team may substitute another player in your place when you leave.


Your team still has to play with the 20-second exclusion -- you can substitute after this period is over., Again, this is similar to soccer. If the referee thinks you're better off keeping the ball, such as being fouled right after you make a good pass, they can say ""advantage"" to acknowledge the foul but keep your team's offensive momentum.


In general, overly violent or dangerous fouls are called immediately even if there is an advantage."

Use the ""eggbeater"" kick to stay afloat while conserving energy.,
Hold one player up in front of the goal to direct your attack.,
Place two players at the 2-meter line, on either side of the goal, as Wings.,
Place your two ""Flats"" on the 5-meter line, between the wings and center.,
Keep one player behind everyone, near the half line and in the center of the pool.,
Keep your wings, point, and flats moving to confuse the defense.,
Flip the offensive formation on defense.",How to Play Water Polo3," Regulation water polo players are not allowed to push off of the wall or sides of the pool. You must tread water the entire time. This is incredibly exhausting, but good players use a rounded, more efficient motion to stay afloat:


Bend your knees roughly 90-degrees as if you were sitting.
Keep your legs slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
Rotate your right leg counterclockwise.
Rotate your left leg clockwise.
Time your legs so that they alternate fluidly., They are called the center forward, and sit about 2 meters (7 ft) outside of the goal to cause confusion and take close-range shots. When you get the ball as a center your goal is to quickly turn and fire a shot off.


Centers take the bulk of physical play, and must have the best endurance and strength.
Centers are also called ""Hole Sets"" by some coaches., You should have a line of three players in front of the goal on offense -- two wings on the sides and one center forward in the middle. A wing's goal is to take long range shots, as well as pass back and forth with the center to make space for a shot.


Wings need to have quick, accurate, and long-range shots.
Remember that you cannot use the walls to push off. You should be a few meters in from the wall as a wing.

, Flats are great passers and long-range shooter. They swim at the goal to draw defenders, which hopefully opens up space for the center forward to get free. They must race back on defense when the ball is turned offer.


Flats tend to be very quick, very mobile swimmers.

, This is your ""Point"" player. They are the first ones back on defense, and the main passers of the team, seeing and setting the entire offense. They rarely shoot, instead looking for the best, most dangerous passes., The movement of your perimeter players (everyone but the center forward) is what opens up shots and breaks down good defenses. This can include swapping positions, crashing towards the goal, or rotating around the pool.


The center forward can move, but they are generally needed to keep the essential space in front of the goal open in case of deflected shots or sudden shooting opportunities.

, You simply slide your formation down the pool on defense. The point guards the opposing center forward, and the center forward guards the point. Your wings will cover their flats and your flats cover their wings. In general, you will play either man to man or zone defense:



Man to Man Defense: Each player follows their match around the pool, no matter where they go.

Zone Defense: Each player stays in their position, trading defensive marks as the other team changes positions.
If the opposing team has a very good center forward, this position is sometimes double-teamed, leaving the offenses point player alone."

Wear the right gear.,
Use helmets or head protection.,
Sport the right shoes.,
Protect other vulnerable areas.,
Teach the rules and proper techniques.,
Teach kids to be aware at all times.,
Instill respect for others.,
Limit contact to games.,
Alter the rules.,
Switch to non-contact sports.",How to Protect Kids Playing Contact Sports," Contact sports usually require some kind of protective equipment, i.e. pads, helmets, shin guards, facemasks, and others. This is for good reason. No one should participate in a contact sport without proper gear. Make sure that your children or players are all sporting the right items.In soccer, for example, players wear shin guards covered with long socks. In high-contact sports like American football and hockey, the gear covers almost all the body: helmet, shoulder and abdominal pads, elbow and knee pads, and sometimes shin guards.
Make sure that the equipment fits properly. Usually this means that the item covers the area it is meant to protect. It should also be snug. Do not let kids “grow into” equipment.Gear should be in good condition. Kids should never wear cracked or broken pieces of equipment.
Inspect gear frequently to catch and replace broken items.;
, Helmets protect kids’ most important body part during contact sports: the head and brain. Studies show that concussions are much more damaging than we once thought, and children are especially vulnerable.Using proper head protection is vital.


Always use helmets designed for the sport you’re playing. A football helmet is not appropriate for hockey, rugby, or boxing.Check to be sure that the helmets meet safety standards set by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission.
Use head guards even in light-contact sports. Players often go without protection in soccer, for example, despite head blows from “heading” the ball. Opt for safety, instead.
Helmets should fit snugly on the head and not shift backward or forward.

, Contact sports also require certain kinds of footwear. Soccer, American football, lacrosse, and other sports use cleated shoes, for example, while hockey uses ice skates. The right footwear will let kids to play the game correctly, while avoiding trips and falls.Be sure that shoes and other footwear fits. Cleats should fit like normal shoes while skates should have slightly more room. Keep in mind that hockey skates also size about 1 to 1 ½ sizes smaller than shoes.Replace shoes, cleats, and skates that are worn out and no longer supportive.

, Don’t forget to have players protect other vulnerable areas, like the eyes, face, and mouth. These areas are not always included in the formal “gear” but should be covered. As a coach, you may have to have kids get certain items on their own.Football and hockey helmets may already have built-in facemasks. Kids can also get eye shields that attach to the helmet or even protective goggles.
Mouth-guards protect the teeth, tongue, and mouth and sell for a few dollars at sporting goods stores. Have your kids or players dip the guard into hot water for about a minute, then remove and bite down on it. This should mould the guard to their teeth. Make sure players remove retainers before playing, too.
Consider a neck guard for hockey, to protect against accidental skate cuts.
Boys may need a jockstrap and protective cup for the groin.

, In sports, rules are in place to protect. Tell your kids or players to think of them not as limits but as safeguards so that everyone can enjoy the game, stay on the field or ice, and avoid injury. Teach proper techniques and behavior, as well.Warn players about all illegal moves and infractions, like tripping, kneeing, chop-blocking, elbowing, and late hits.
If the sport is American football or rugby, kids should also know proper tackling technique. In youth football tacklers should have their heads up, for example, engaging the opponent with the shoulder pads. They should NOT lead with their head.For hockey, young players might be allowed to body check and should know the right technique, too. To give a clean check, you want your shoulder to make contact with your opponent’s chest. You are not allowed to hit with your elbows or stick, you can’t leave your feet, and you can’t make contact with the head., As hockey players learn from a young age, “keep your head up”! Young players should be aware of what’s going on at all times during a game, even if they are not directly involved in the play. Not paying attention can in fact lead to accidental or non-accidental injuries.


Warn players never to put themselves in vulnerable positions, if they can. In American football, for example, the kickoff can be a dangerous play and requires extra awareness.Wide receivers should be careful about running patterns where they can be blindsided, like a crossing route.
In hockey, puck carriers shouldn’t look down when stick handling, because they open themselves up to devastating body checks.
Hockey players should also be very careful when going into corners to get loose pucks, since a check from behind can send them head-first into the boards.

, While players have to be aware, they also have to pay look out for other players and their safety. This is basic respect. A player might be able to hit an opponent from the blindside. It might even be legal. But taking advantage of a vulnerable player is not respectful or good sportsmanship.


Some contact sports have “cultures of violence.” Big hits and intimidation are praised. Players learn by example that they should target opponents, “lay them out,” or “destroy” them.
As a parent or coach, warn and discourage children who make dangerous plays and don’t praise them. Say something like, “You hit number 20 from behind. That was dangerous and illegal; it’s not OK to take advantage of someone who’s vulnerable. Hit cleanly the next time.”
Respect is especially important in sports like hockey and lacrosse, where players have sticks. Teach players that they should NEVER use a stick as a weapon against an opponent.

, Want a simple way to reduce injury in contact sports? Reduce contact. You can do this in several ways, one of which is by removing contact from everything but the game. That means no contact in practice, drills, or informal scrimmages.


Try going to touch-only practices in football. In hockey or lacrosse, ban hitting in practices and scrimmages.
Limiting contact to games should reduce all kinds of injuries, like concussions, breaks, sprains, and muscle tears.Reducing the number of blows to the head is important, particularly as we learn more about the effects of concussions on the brain. Getting rid of contact in practice could lower the total blows to the brain by ½.
A study in football also showed that players take more low-level blows to the head in practice than in games., Another way to protect players in contact sports is to alter the rules slightly. Some people might argue that changing the rules will “undermine” the game. This is not necessarily true. Hitting and contact are key parts of some games like rugby. But it can be reduced in others without affecting the overall sport.


In a youth league, try raising your concerns with league administrators and propose safer rules.
Get rid of heading in your soccer league. You’ll actually be in line with the US Soccer Federation’s new guidelines for youth leagues.Lacrosse and hockey are not always played with hitting, either, and usually restrict body-checking until about 12 to 15 years of age. Women’s hockey normally does not allow body checks, even at the highest levels.Switch to flag-football. Some communities in the US have started to eliminate tackle football in favor of non-contact kinds, at least for kids., The easiest way to protect kids in sports is to remove contact entirely. Kids don’t need contact in order to benefit from playing a sport. They can learn all of the same lessons about teamwork, winning, losing, competition, and sportsmanship from non-contact kinds.


Consider a team game like baseball, basketball, or volleyball. Field hockey is a fun and exciting game, as well.
Individual non-contact sports are great for exercise and learning, too, like tennis, swimming, and track and field events.

STRETCH!!!,
Start off kneeling, making sure to go through the entire motion of throwing.,
When you can't reach your throwing buddy anymore from your knees, stand up and continue to try to throw through your partners head/chest with the ball.,
Remember the most important thing about this process is to not overstress your arm.,
As your arm tires, have your partner come in about 5 yards (4.6 m) each time you throw.",How to Play Long Toss," These yard markers show how far you are throwing,(1 yard = 3 feet).;
, If you do not stretch before throwing, you run the risk of injuring your arm.

, IE: shoulders facing your target, arms separating forming a T, and finally driving your glove and non-throwing shoulder to your target. Increase the distance as you go. Be sure to take your time while warming up. Also while throwing make sure you are trying to throw the ball through the person you are throwing with.

, This helps you get a good idea of your release point while throwing.

, Don't try to start out throwing 60 yards (54.9 m) on the first day. Work up to further distances as your arm strength improves. This might take a few rounds of long toss but the end results are definitely worth it!

, This process helps your arm ""cool down"" so to speak. After you're done make sure to stretch your arm and ice it for about 20-30 minutes to help it heal.

In general, it’s healthier and more effective to focus on strength you want to build or activities you want to perform, as opposed to a certain look.


Some sample goals include: running a 5K without stopping, touching your toes, lifting your own weight above your head, and doing the splits.
Some fitness programs and diets even discourage you from weighing or measuring yourself as you change your routines.Getting bogged down in the look of your body can distract you from what it can do.
Write down your goals in a notebook and set an alarm to look at them in three months, six months, or a year.;
, Building a new routine can be tricky: it takes about two months for a new habit to become second nature.Still, you want to set goals that don’t feel too distant. Many fitness experts recommend a three month timeframe: a season is long enough that you can accomplish a great deal, but not so lengthy that you feel like you’ll never see the end of it.Some races and events, like marathons, have a somewhat standardized recommended training schedule.It’s okay to have smaller mini-goals. For instance, you may plan to weight up five pounds on the rowing machine every two weeks.
Remember that working out every day is a goal in and of itself.

, Every body is different, and everyone’s goals are too. Because of this, there’s rarely one-size-fits-all fitness advice. You are powerfully positioned to learn, because you know yourself and your aims better than anyone does. Put some time in to learn what types of exercise will suit you and which ones you like. There are plenty of resources out there to help.


Though it can’t replace an instructor who watches you in person, the Internet has many reliable fonts of fitness information. Start with the President's Council on Fitness page.
If you aren't ready to venture outside with your fitness routine, there are plenty of workouts on YouTube that you can do at home with no equipment. Try Blogilates or Fitness Blender.

, If you have the option, do trial workouts at different gyms until you find a vibe you like. Even better, most gyms offer orientations, where an expert can show you how to use different types of equipment to safely maximize your workout. There are many criteria for selecting the perfect gym, including:


Is it easy for you to get to?
Is it usually full? Can you easily access equipment?
Do you feel comfortable around the other members?, Group classes offer the benefits of in-person instruction for beginners without the pressures of personal training. Plus, the regular schedules and presence of other fitness enthusiasts can help you stay motivated.If you're trying to figure out what you like, try a service like Groupon or ClassPass. These offer a discounted pack of classes, so you can figure out if you're really into hot yoga or spinning before committing to them.

, It’s admirable to want to push yourself, but you can’t turn from a couch potato into a track star in a week. Exhaustion is real, and burnout can negatively impact your ability to reach your goals.Work your way slowly up to your exercise goals. For example, if you want to run, start out by walking at a brisk pace until your body feels comfortable and ready for jogging or running.


Walk up and down flights of stairs instead of taking elevators or escalators, and park your automobile in the farthest spot away from your destination to increase your daily activity in the beginning.
If you’re too tired for a full workout one day but still want to move, take a long walk or do house or yard work.

Consider the safety of the height.,
Find a soft surface to jump down to.Whether you're jumping down for fun or in an emergency, the surface you're landing on will have a huge effect on the landing itself.,
Wear shoes with shock absorption.,
Try to relax.While it may seem counter-intuitive if you're getting ready for a big jump, it is important to relax a much as you can.,
Lower yourself as much as possible.There may be unfortunate occasions where you need to land a high jump in an emergency and aren't doing it for athletic sport.,
Get a friend to keep watch.A friend is good to have around because he can watch your jump and tell you how it looks.,
Warm up before your jump.Squats and stretches should be done in the minutes before your jump.,
Pinpoint the landing target.,
Run through a mock-jump.,
Jump towards your target.,
Hold your form.,
Spare room for flexibility.,
Allow your body to go limp.,
Land on both feet.In any type of jump, landing on one foot effectively doubles the amount of pressure on that foot.,
Perfect a landing roll.,
Do squats.Squats are a great go-to exercise.,
Work plyometrics into your exercise routine.,
Get enough sleep.Most people aim to get by with 5 or 6 hours per night.,
Stay hydrated.Water is a necessary thing for the body to function, and you tend to need more of it when you're exercising.,
Take your training slowly.If you're lucky enough to be jumping for fun rather than necessity, you should take advantage of the fact that you can learn at your own pace.,
Keep practicing.Jumping can be a lot of fun.",How to Land a Jump from a High Place," While height is just one of the factors that dictates the safety of a fall (along with falling surface and jump form) it is something you should take into consideration while you plan your jump. 10 feet can result in an injury if you fall on one foot or your spine. Falls of 30 feet or more could result in serious injuries or even death.There have been a few recorded cases of people falling thousands of feet and surviving. Don't use this as an example to go by, however. These are considered miraculous exceptions for a good reason.;
, Softer surfaces are always preferable to hard ones, as they'll help absorb some of the shock of the land.


Grass, sand and mud are good places to fall to. Concrete, on the other hand, is about as unforgiving as it gets.
Surfaces with a lot of degree can pose an extra threat. Landing onto an otherwise soft area with pine needles would result in a different (but similarly intense) sort of pain.

, If you have time to prepare for your jump, you should make sure to wear something on your feet that will help to cushion the force. If you're aiming for a proper landing on your feet, you run the risk of hurting them without something to ease the shock. Most sports sneakers include this technology in some form.


Shoes with a strong grip help if there's any risk of slipping during your fall.

, If you get needlessly frustrated, your joints will tense up. This increases the risk of potential injury. If you've got the time to spare, try looking at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself everything will be okay.

, If this is the case, you'll want to be as practical as possible. Look around you, and try to see if there are any opportunities to get yourself lower to the ground.


Holding yourself off a ledge can get you 6 feet closer to the ground. This difference in altitude can mean a lot with regards to potential injury., It goes without saying that having a friend watching over you is more helpful if he's already got some fitness knowledge. Perhaps more importantly, the presence of someone nearby will ensure the quickest call for medical attention if you need it for whatever reason.

, Even if it's not enough time to train, the act of going through a bit of a moderate workout will loosen up your joints and get your body into the proper momentum for strain.

, As you're about to jump, make a point of spotting the place you would like to land. Having a specific place on the ground below you will increase your stability. If you're only aiming for a broad area, you're more likely to lose concentration.

, Although you should have already warmed up by this point, you can go through a mock jump right before you make the actual leap. Many athletic jumpers use a mock run-through in the seconds before as a way to build up momentum. You should do the same as you count down to your leap. Use these final moments as an opportunity to check everything you're doing with your jump set-up.

, In a jump down to a lower place, you won't want to jump much higher than you already are. Get just enough force to earn you the proper stance and momentum. Keep your elbows close to your body, and tuck your chin in close to your neck.Bend your knees and lunge forward however much you need to. All of this will minimize potential injury.


For the sake of keeping your body straight, keep your eyes fixed forward. This will keep your body from going imbalanced in mid-jump.
Some people may freak out if they see themselves dropping a far-enough distance, so if you're queasy, it's best to keep your eyes off the ground.

, A proper athletic jump should end in the same stance as it began. Do your best to keep your body straight. Even in freefall, it's important to keep your stance straight and stable. Letting your limbs go wild will increase the risk of injury.


Keep your feet and knees together while you jump. This will maximize the chances of you landing on both feet.Although you'll want to keep your body from moving around excessively, you should allow room for flexibility as your body meets the landing., Giving your body the freedom to adjust as you meet the ground is essential for preventing injury.Don't lock your knees at any point, and give your muscles the limberness they'll need to counter the force of the land.


Bending the knees will reduce shock. Just make sure your legs aren't bent more than 90 degrees.Exercising with squats will help your body adjust to this change when it's needed., If your body is ""soft"" (rather than tensed), you'll be able to react naturally to a landing. This is a natural way of minimizing potential damage in a fall.With this said, it's a good idea to try to make yourself as relaxed as possible before you set into your jump.


Try to strike a balance between going limp and holding your proper form.

, Do your best to keep your legs and feet together throughout the jump. This will maximize the chances of your feet hitting the ground at the same time. Landing on both feet is more important if your jump is high enough. An imbalanced fall can result in severe injury.


Don't try to break your fall with your hands. Hands can alleviate some of the shock on your feet, but they can generally withstand only a fraction of the pressure that feet can.When you land, try to land on the balls of your feet, shoulder-width apart.

, It's not just a thing for action movies. A landing roll is arguably the best way of absorbing shock from a fall. If you're landing from a height, you should aim for a diagonal roll. Pushing yourself into a roll with one foot will avoid placing stress on your spine.As you fall, aim a shoulder to the ground in the direction you want to roll in. As you're rolling, take a foot and hit the ground with it to give you the extra force you need to complete the roll.


Rolls are difficult to master and should be left to trained athletes. It should be said as a high-difficulty alternative to landing on both feet.
Try rolling on both sides. It's a good habit for athletic versatility, and you may find you prefer one side over the other.For practice, regular ""gymnastics rolls"" (without a jump) will get you used to the experience of rolling. They're relatively easy to do provided you have a degree of fitness and flexibility. If you want to practice with diagonal rolls, a playground (with a soft ground) is a good place to start.Rolls lead well into continued movement. This is why they're so highly recommended in sports like parkour.

, They're relatively cheap and easy to do anywhere, but they target a lot of muscles that aren't typically worked out. To squat, bend your knees as low as you can while you keep your back perfectly straight. Hold your place for 30 seconds, then release and try again.


Squats are remarkably challenging at first if you're unused to them. However, your body will train up fast.

, Plyometrics refer to a series of exercises intended to balance out the use of muscles in your legs. Because people are usually sitting down in their jobs, the sedentary behaviour trains the legs to depend on knees instead of glutes. Plyometrics aims to reverse this.Make a sequence of tiny jumps, only a couple inches off the ground. Try to make your landings as quiet and soft a possible.Shift your body's weight around on your heels, keeping your knees behind your toes throughout the movement.

, This is short of the recommended 7-9 hour routine. Athletes should arguably be sleeping 9-10 hours in order to accommodate for all of the wear and tear the body goes through from regular practice. If you're not giving yourself enough sleep, you're putting a major curb on your jump potential.

, In the case of jumping, water is essential to keep the joints fluid and limber. Keep a refillable bottle of water whenever you're planning to train or jump. Drink it whenever you get a break.


Don't drink so much water that you end up feeling bloated. The feeling doesn't last forever, but it is uncomfortable and limits your training for a while.

, Start with small heights, and gradually work your way forward. The process may not be as glamorous as with taking the biggest jumps from the start, but it is more effective in terms of raw learning.

, Even if you consider yourself properly trained at a certain point, there's a lot of value in continuing to practice. Because something like jumping depends on a lot of various factors like distance, height and weight, the particulars will be different each time you try it. Over time, you'll get a sharper understanding of how your body is best used with a jump.

Schedule your workouts.,
Find a workout buddy.,
Pack your equipment ahead of time.,
Stretch.,
Move every day.",How to Make Fitness a Daily Routine2," You will best adhere to a routine if you designate daily times for exercise. Without a specific timeframe, you may be more likely to stray from your daily fitness commitment.Once you’ve been scheduling them for a month or two, your workouts will feel like a natural part of your day, just like showering or eating breakfast.


You can split your workout into chunks if necessary (for instance, running before breakfast and Pilates after work).
Make a new color in your calendar for fitness, and officially mark off a block of time for it every day.
Choose a time that complements your daily schedule. For example, if you join a gym located near your place of work, you can exercise early in the morning before you go to work, or in the afternoons or evenings following your work shift.

, If you’re more likely to keep social obligations than promises to yourself, it might help you to plan your workouts for two. Many people find that this helps them keep to their workouts, and, as a bonus, makes them enjoy their time. It’s a win-win.Try to find a buddy who’s at a similar level to you, so you can grow together. If one of you is much more experienced than the other, it might throw off the “buddy” power dynamic.
If you’re a long-distance runner and you live in a town or city, there are probably multiple running groups you can join. Ask around!

, This way, you can go to your workout without taking the extra time to prepare, which can be helpful if your daily schedule is extremely busy. Put together your gym bag for the following day before you go to bed, or keep your fitness equipment in your car or in a locker at the gym.

, It may seem counterintuitive, because it’s an extra ten minutes at the end of your workout, but stretching may protect you from a lot of soreness tomorrow. (This saves you time in the long run.) Furthermore, it helps build strength and flexibility, and it’s a nice way to cool down your mind as well as your body at the end of a tough session.Stretch your legs. Lunge forward so your knee makes a ninety-degree angle, and keep your back foot flat on the ground. You should feel a strong stretch in your back calf.
Stretch your arms. Bend your elbow so that it’s above your head and your hand rests between your shoulder blades. Grab the raised elbow in your other hand and pull it to your opposite ear.

, On average, an adult body needs at least 30 minutes of exercise daily.It’s hard to get that in sometimes, so try to have some backup workouts in mind in case you can’t make it to the gym or jog a 10K. For instance, you might jump rope for or do a half-hour YouTube Pilates routine that challenges you. If all else fails, turn on your favorite music and have a solo dance party!

"
"
Enjoy your workout.,
Play fun music.,
Mix it up.,
Consult an expert.,
Eat right.,
Listen to your body.",How to Make Fitness a Daily Routine3," You will be more likely to establish and adhere to a daily routine if you genuinely enjoy the activity you are performing. For example, if you enjoy playing a specific sport, join a neighborhood team. If being lonely bums you out, find group motivation in a bootcamp class.You might have to experiment to find things you like, and that’s part of the journey.

, Whatever makes you energized is ideal. Plenty of people are embarrassed by their workout music, but if a particular boy band pushes you to run a couple more miles, who cares? If you're stuck on finding the perfect jams, services like Spotify and IHeartRadio often curate workout playlists, so start with those.

, As you continue to exercise, your routine may begin to feel more like a rut. Don’t let that happen--if you start getting sick of exercise, experiment with something new. Trying different things will challenge your body to move in new ways, which will both make you stronger and keep you from being bored.Build off of something you’ve done before. If you’ve liked Zumba, maybe it’s time to try a salsa dancing class.
Alternately, try something totally different. If you love lifting weights, yoga just might increase your core strength and your mental clarity.

, A certified fitness trainer can help you push yourself, both on days when you see them and on days when you work out solo.Inquire at your gym to find trainers, or ask people you trust if they have recommendations.


Pick a trainer you feel comfortable with. You won’t be able to improve if you feel scared, intimidated, or talked down to.
You don’t need to go every week--a good trainer will help you craft a routine that continues to grow with you., Nutrition isn’t an exact science and different bodies need different things, but if you want to keep working out and seeing good results, you need to power yourself with the right food. Cutting down on both alcohol and caffeine can be helpful, but the food that will suit you best depends on how you like to work out.


Eat carbs if you’re going to be doing lots of cardio. Whole grains, berries and fruits contain slow-burning sugars that will keep you going.Protein reinforces strength and weight training. Grilled chicken and spinach is a classic post-workout snack, but chocolate milk is also great., If you exercise on a daily basis even on days when you are especially tired or sore, you may become resentful of your fitness routine and lose the motivation to work out. Allow your body to rest and recover one day per week. If you feel guilty about missing a workout, or want to maintain a routine even when you are tired, take a walk or go for a hike.

Maintain a sleep schedule.,
Skip the snooze button.,
Expose yourself to natural light right away.,
Consume a small amount of caffeine.,
Eat a healthy breakfast.,
Drink water throughout the day.,
Opt for healthy protein.,
Choose healthy carbs.,
Snack smart throughout the day.,
Move throughout the day.,
Spend time in the sun.,
Meditate on occasion.",How to Maintain Your Energy Throughout the Day," Your body has a natural circadian rhythm that adapts to a regular sleep/wake cycle. If you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day, it will be easier to maintain your energy throughout the day as you'll wake in the morning feeling rested and refreshed.Even on the weekends, try to maintain your schedule. Even a small deviation from your schedule can affect how rested you feel.;
, Try to avoid the temptation of opting for the extra few minutes of rest provided by the snooze button. Hitting snooze actually makes you feel more tired. While the extra few minutes of rest may feel tempting, the sleep you get is less high quality. Waking up from low quality sleep will leave you feeling groggy.Set your alarm for the time you actually intend to get up. Do not set it earlier so you can turn it off and sleep in.
Many people find it helpful to keep their alarm across the room. This way, you will have to get up and shut it off. This makes it harder to simply switch the alarm to snooze and crawl back in bed.

, Sunlight has a stimulating effect on the brain because it reminds your body it's morning. Try to expose yourself to some sunlight as soon as you get up in the morning. This will give you an energy boost at the beginning of your day. If possible, keep the blinds open in your bedroom. This will assure that you're exposed to quality sunlight as soon as the sun rises in the morning.
If you get up before the sun rises, try investing in a quality lamp that simulates sunlight. This can have a similar effect on your brain.

, High amounts of caffeine may cause you to crash later on. However, consuming a small amount of caffeine early in the morning can give you an energy boost for the coming day.Have a single cup of coffee or tea in the morning. This will make you feel more alert going into the day. Entering the day feeling groggy can affect your energy level for the rest of the day.

, An energizing breakfast can help your body maintain energy throughout the day. Always eat breakfast shortly after getting up. Opt for a healthy breakfast that will leave you feeling energetic and refreshed.Choose a breakfast that contains healthy carbohydrates and high quality proteins, as these help power your body. For example, have a slice of whole wheat bread with two hard boiled eggs.
As your body requires many servings of fruit and vegetables to function, try having a piece of fruit or a serving of veggies with your breakfast as well.

, Dehydration can leave you feeling groggy, so do not neglect your water intake. Try to have a glass of water with meals and sip water throughout the day. Keep a water bottle near you at all times and periodically take a sip. You should also take advantage of any water fountains you see during your day., You should eat protein at meals and snack on it throughout the day. Protein is great fuel for the body as it keeps you feeling strong and energized. However, the kind of protein you choose matters. When selecting proteins, go for healthy choices.For meat, go for sources like lean meats, protein, and fish during meals.
You can also snack on vegetarian sources of protein, like nuts, low-fat dairy, and yogurt.

, Many people believe carbohydrates make you feel groggy. However, your body actually needs carbohydrates to maintain energy. Refined carbs, like white breads, can diminish your energy. However, healthy and complex carbohydrates can help you maintain your energy throughout the day.Read nutritional labels. Go for carbohydrates that contain plenty of fiber.
Opt for whole grains and whole wheat when you can. Have half a whole wheat bagel for a snack instead of half a bagel made from white bread, for example.

, Keep snacks on hand to have when you feel hungry or low energy. Healthy snacking can help give you an energy boost when necessary, which can help you maintain high energy throughout the day.Yogurts, fruits, vegetables, and mixed nuts are great options for healthy snacks.
You should avoid snacks high in sugar or consuming highly processed foods. These types of snacks are unlikely to give you an energy boost.

, Sitting too long can actually cause fatigue. Small amounts of exercise can stimulate the body and allow you to feel more energetic throughout the day. If you begin to feel groggy, try doing some light exercise.Try doing a small amount of energy, like going for a brief walk, when your energy begins to dip.
Have a regular workout each day. If you always hit the gym after work, you may feel more refreshed when you come home at night.

, Exposing yourself to sunlight during the day can be incredibly stimulating. If you expose yourself to sunlight for at least 30 minutes a day, you'll feel more energetic.The best time to get sunlight is between 10 AM and 2 PM.

, Meditation can decrease stress, which tends to deplete energy. Small pockets of meditation throughout the day can help you maintain your energy when it starts to feel depleted.You don't have to dedicate a full 20 minutes to meditating each time you feel stressed. The process can be as simple as closing your eyes for 3 minutes and paying attention to your breathing and physical sensations. This can help redirect your thoughts to the present, eliminating stressful thoughts that drain your energy.

",How to Look Effortlessly Pretty While Playing Sport3," The worst possible thing to happen is to get burnt while playing sport. It hurts and makes it virtually impossible to run. Even if it's not hot out, still apply sunscreen or a moisturiser that contains SPF. Rub it thoroughly into your face in circular motions.

, Get a dab of concealer or if you don't have any, make your own. First, find a jar or an empty moisturiser tub to put your concealer into. Next, get a white moisturiser and put some into the tub. Put in a generous amount, don't be afraid of wasting it! This method acts as a moisturiser too! Grab some of your foundation and mix it in well with the moisturiser. Add more or less than each ingredient. If you want a fresh, dewy look, add more moisturiser than foundation and. Apply the concealer under your eyes or wherever you feel you need it.

, Use black or brown mascara, these are the only two natural shades. Apply the mascara in a zig-zag motion to avoid it sticking your lashes together. Before applying it, check to see if its water-proof. You only make that mistake once.

, Vaseline works wonders and lasts for a while but other brands work too. Apply some on you eyelashes also to give your eyes a fresh look.

Get to know your team!,
Learn to react quickly.,
Use everything at your disposal.,
Switch up your tactics.,
Be brave and try everything.,
Move.,
Cause trouble.,
Here are a few tactics you can use.",How to Make Quick Decisions While Playing Airsoft," If you are a sergeant, make sure you have enough players to get a certain job done. Also, do not assume a sniper will save you in every situation! A sniper is a valuable asset, but can't save you from everything. If you are a sergeant, make sure you know your team's guns and abilities well.;
, Taking a martial art like karate or fencing is a great way to improve your reaction time. If you're unable to do this, try having half of your team open fire on the rest of your team. Tell the team under your command when to open fire, move, counter-attack, fall back, etc. Even if you aren't a sergeant, if you tell team members what to do in a tough situation, they will most likely listen to you.

, If there is movable cover, use it to move troops out of heavy fire. Think outside the box. If there is no cover available, don't run. If you have to retreat, run in a different direction than to your HQ. Use retreats as a last resort. You may often find that you can repel an enemy invasion if you use simple flanking and suppressing techniques.

, Using the same plan over and over is a terrible decision. The enemy will undoubtedly find a way around your tactics and force you to either stand and lose or retreat. Try different plans, even if you don't think they will work. If they do work, don't get cocky and do it again. Think over every option.

, Even if you might have to sacrifice yourself for a plan, do it. Make yourself get taken prisoner of war if you must. For example, and enemy HQ is completely in-penetrable. You know no way to get in from the outside to get their Intel and win the round. You offer yourself to be taken POW. From there, your teammates can go to another enemy base, forcing the enemy to send all of their troops to the assaulted position. Amidst the chaos, you escape, steal the Intel, and win the round.

, Never stay pinned in one spot.

, One of the best tactics you can use is sabotage enemy equipment. It's mean, but if you've got the force to do it, do it.

, Hit and run: Use stealth to slam enemies and then escape. Infiltration: Using two operatives of your choice, move into enemy territory and get Intel on patrols, equipment movement, etc. Counter-Attack: Quickly retreat and hide your troops. If the enemy is dumb enough to follow, ambush them and make them surrender.

Use a screwdriver and wood screws to screw them together., The bait pedal is the metal rectangle part that the mouse steps on to release the trap. Drill a hole behind it through the mouse trap. You'll tie a knot over the bait pedal later., If your pop caps are in a ring, cut out individual ones.One should fit over a small nail head.Instead of pop caps, you can use a glow stick., You need to see where it's hitting the wood when it releases., Where the bow hits the wood along the sides, drill a small hole on each side. Hammer a nail in each hole. The head of the nail should face the bow as it swings down. In other words, the bow should come down and hit the nail on the head when the trap releases.If you're using a glow stick, drill four holes. Tie the glow stick on so that the bow hits it when the trap releases., If you want to camouflage your trap, paint the mousetrap and the pegs to match the surroundings.You can also paint the tent pegs before you attach the mousetrap.

, Securely tie the line to the other tent peg. Hammer the peg into the ground., Make sure the wire is taut across the path. Run it into the back of the trap to the front, and tie it to the bait pedal., Rubber band the tripwire onto the peg and the mousetrap. The rubber band will secure the tripwire., Add a pop cap to each nail head. Pull the bow down to arm the trap., When the tripwire is triggered, the mousetrap will hit the pop caps, making a loud bang. It will tell if a person is walking in the area.If you used a glow stick, the glow stick will light up when hit."

, Mark the middle of the bottle. Use a hacksaw or scissors to cut the bottle in half. You'll use the top half of the bottle for this trap., Use sandpaper to smooth the edge of the bottle. Also, tape over the edges with duct tape., Stretch the rest of the balloon over the bottle opening. It doesn't have to go over all the edges. It just needs to stretch across the middle in a single band., Part of a Popsicle stick would work well for this project. It should be shorter than the balloon band is wide. Round the edges., Place hot glue on the piece of wood. Glue down a strong piece of string across the wood., The balloon should go across the width of the balloon band. Let the strings go down on either side. Pull the ends through the mouth of the bottle, going from the inside of the bottle to the outside., Tie a knot in the thread that rests partway down the inside of the bottle. , Use three pieces of sharp wood that are longer than the half bottle. Glue or tape them them on to each side. They should stick out past the mouth but not out past the other end. You'll use these to stick the tripwire in the ground., Use a small piece of wood that barely reaches across the mouth of the bottle. Tie a long string to the end., Tie the other end of the string to the top of a small stake. A Popsicle stick will work for this part as well., Place the small stick under the knot. Angle the wood across the mouth of the bottle., Push the stakes in the ground, being careful not to pull the trigger.To truly prank your friends, you need to disguise the trap somehow. However, you can't hide the top of the bottle, as that will release your trap.

Have fun!",How to Improve Your Airsoft Sniper Skills," A sniper must often wait a while until the enemy shows up or until there is a good chance of easy engagement.;
, Most Airsoft Snipers upgrade their sniper rifles as most of the ""stock"" (just bought ones) are often just as powerful as some Assault Rifles.

, 0.20g BBs are most popular for all Airsofters but Airsoft Snipers often choose 0.25g or 0.30g BBs for better accuracy. Make sure they are well made to prevent damage to your gun.

, Scope is very useful in ranges and zooming in helps you to aim. I would recommend a scope with at least 4x zoom.

, This helps you to prevent being seen by the enemy.

, It is useful as most professionally organized Airsoft teams use common tactics, which sometimes (depends on situation you are in) can be easily overtaken by that one or more snipers. Also don't forget that you are not to see frontline engagements but to support your team from a distance so make sure you stick to it.

, Your own garden is good one for practice. Get to know your rifle's capabilities and practice more until your shooting accuracy gradually improves.

, Snipers don't move as much as most Airsofters but if they do then they require much more speed and must be fitter. This is caused by the fact that once a sniper is seen by the enemy they need to either engage or run to cover.

, Sometimes you might see only one or two opponents but when you hit them then you might get a whole team after you. Also if the enemy team is well organized and has a squad leader then he or she should be your primary target. This will make confusing within your opponents and strike fear within their hearts.

, Watch if there is anything that you can use to hide (such as bushes) and look out for any opponents. The most dangerous opponents are enemy snipers so keep an eye for them!

, Some snipers often just stand around and get shot easily. Walk slowly around, keeping an eye on everything, keep finger on the trigger, keep heart rate low and breathe slowly.

, Instead of moving loud around the battlefield move slowly but quietly.

, A successful sniper is the one that enemy is really afraid of.

Before you enter the battlefield, it's a good idea to get in some training.,
Take your gun out to your backyard (not to public property, as the police might not like it) and set up some targets.,
Once you're fairly well practiced at killing defenseless plastic, it's time to move up to bigger game.,
So, now you're after the ultimate game: man.,
Defense Oriented players tend to stay in a general area, either guarding an important location or laying in wait for passing enemies.,
It has also been suggested that one could mislead the sniper into believing you don't know he's there, by pointing your weapon in some other direction, all the while secretly watching him.,
Offense Oriented players won't wait for you to come to them - they're coming to get you.,
Remember, the more you play, the better you will become.",How to Improve Your Airsoft Skills," You can find airsoft guns online (a simple search will turn up lots of sites, as well as good old eBay) or at a local retailer (many sporting goods stores sell airsoft guns). Remember that you get what you pay for, and while that Walmart gun is a lot less expensive, you'll be lucky to hit anything with it. A quality pistol should run you from 80 to 150 USD, and a quality assault rifle should go for about 130 to 250 dollars,and the best guns range from about 250 to 500 bucks, but you don't always need to spend that much to get a great gun. If you're new, you probably shouldn't spend lots of money to get a scoped rifle or a sniper rifle, as you won't have the skills necessary to use it effectively.;
, Empty plastic water bottles work well. Try hitting them from increasing distances, at odd angles, and while moving. Remember, you have to account for drop. Air resistance slows the plastic BBs, and gravity causes them to fall. The farther you are, the higher up you will have to aim to hit the same target.

, Find a local airsoft team, or try with your friends. The more you do it, the better you will become. If you are brave enough the best thing to do is let someone empty a magazine on you. It hurts like heck but it will help you to become more acquainted with how badly it hurts, thus allowing you to be that much bolder for it.

, Being prepared for what your opponent will do is essential. For the sake of keeping this short, we will recklessly break down the myriad numbers of styles and skill levels into two basic types - Defense Oriented and Offense Oriented.

, The harder to 'kill' of the types, skilled D.O. players will have selected a tactically superior position and have hidden themselves well. If they are experienced, you will not see them. Try to listen for where the gun shot is coming from and take cover You will have to pay attention to their work. Allies dropping 'dead' at a seemingly deserted intersection is a good indication that an enemy sniper is present. Try to track the possible locations the sniper could be lying in, based on the location of his kills. Attempt to maneuver around his field of fire, and creep up out of sight until you can see him. Take careful aim, and remove him from the battle.

, The problem with this is, is that if the sniper can see you pretending not to see him, he will not leave cover to engage you. He will stay where he is and shoot you.

, They are easier to find, coming through the brush looking for you. But wait, that seemingly easy target could be a trap, bait intended to locate you. Find the nearest cover you can, as quietly as you can. Scan the area around and behind the O.O. player coming at you. If no one seems to be escorting him, then take him out. Engage the enemy with a minimum of movement and sound, so that if he is being covered, they may not see you.

, Don't be disheartened if you can't seem to win. Ask fellow players for help, and keep trying. Good luck, be safe, and over all - Have Fun!

, Be sure not to make the body of the holster too tight, or the gun may not fit.

, Make sure to push down all tape and keep the bumps and ridges to a minimum.

,, Depending on the size of your airsoft gun, the length of the strap will vary. For full scale models, I recommend 12 inches (30.5 cm) of strap or more, to half scale, 7 inches (17.8 cm) or more, and anything below, you don't need a holster.

, Then, reinforce the strip with a 1-2 layers of paper tape.

, Make sure when you wrap the strap around the grip of the gun, it stays on the grip only.

Have mines.",How to Get Ready for an Airsoft Game," A duffel bags is the most appropriate bag to use when getting ready for an airsoft game. It will be used to hold all of your airsoft items.;
, Always get a gun with at least 350 fps for field, or 300-350 for close quarter battle (CQB). Anything lower than that would be a very cheap gun. Get a small sidearm, preferably a CO2 or green gas/propane powered handgun with a holster. Small automatic assault rifles (AEGs) can be used as a secondary weapon as well. Buy your primary weapon, preferably an AEG over 350fps for a field game, at least 300fps, but not over 350fps for CQB or a Sniper Rifle 'Over 400fps'.

, Invest in a nice pair of goggles, and wear them when playing games of airsoft. These are vital for your safety. Use a brand name for airsoft goggles.

,, Nothing cheap that you can get at the mall for under $10.

, A major asset to airsoft games are grenades. These devices give you the upper hand during skirmishes and other tactical advances. Smoke grenades, which can be bought at your local firework stand, are usually very effective. Airsoft grenades are also effective. To make these you'll need a plastic Easter egg. Fill it with airsoft BB's and 1 M-1000 and poke a hole the top half of the Easter egg so you can stick a fuse in it. Then light it and Boom. Not all fields allow these though, and used improperly can be really dangerous.

,, Make sure that camo matches to what type of forest or other terrain you are playing your airsoft game in. Common places to play are urban, snow. desert, and green forest.

, Always make sure you wear either a camo hat or helmet.

, Vests are vital to holding your supplies during battle.

, Look up statistics and learn how to field strip them as well. You do not want your gun to jam in the middle of a fire fight.

, If your gun is 300-350 FPS get 0.20 g bbs, and for 350-400 FPS get 0.25 g bbs. Always get 12 gram CO2 cartridges, or gas if you're using a gas blow back pistol, preferably 15 CO2 rounds and 8000 of your choice weight BB's. That should last you a couple days in FULL-DAY airsoft wars.

,, Never wear Nike shoes or walking shoes for outdoor. Wear any type of boot that appeals to you. 5.11, Wolverine, and Timberland are good choices.

, In the event that someone falls into a thorn bush or gets cut, sanitize and cover wounds.

, Make sure it's the voltage that it is set for, because you do not want to ruin you gearbox.

,, Before the game starts shoot your gun(s) off a couple times just to put a mental note of how far the bb travels.

, Have zip ties handy, as they a very effective role in restraining POWs (prisoners of war) when taking them hostage. A screwdriver is great for switching out parts for your gun and removing things off the rail system. The knife is great for cutting items such as zip-ties and cutting tape. Duct tape is helpful to every aspect of airsoft.

, Another great safety item are gloves. They are very useful when you need to take position in a tree and you don't want to cut your hands or you need to pick up something that you couldn't without hand protection. It is very painful to be shot on the hand, so gloves come in handy. Mechanic gloves are great and can be used in many different applications.

,, These can be expensive and impractical, seeing as how most airsoft claymores need to be remotely set off. Although, they do add another dynamic to warfare and sometimes increase the fun.

",How to Do Airsoft," This will take money.;
, There are three types of Airsoft guns.


There is the spring gun (springer), which uses a high power spring to launch the bb. The downside to this is that after every shot, you have to cock the gun. Also, unless you pay 70+ for the gun, it is probably very inaccurate compared to an AEG. They make decent sidearms, and if you wish to be an Airsoft Sniper, the spring sniper rifle is where you start.
There is the electric gun which uses electricity to power the gun. They differ a lot in terms of cost, as some of them are good quality and cost about $90 - $100, but professional ones can easily go as high as $300 - $400. Electric guns are quite popular in Airsoft skirmishes, as they are reliable and versatile.
There are also gas guns which use gas to propel the bbs at very fast velocity. You need to buy gas to refill your gun, and this might cost quite a bit after a while. Gas guns also need at least 15 °C (59 °F) to operate effectively (most of them anyway).

, LPEG is low power electric gun, MPEG is mid power electric gun, and AEG is simply automatic electric gun.

, Usually the AEG is a higher quality gun and you get much more bang for your buck. Most long-time airsofters eventually get a good AEG, and it lasts a while. This is your standard ""serious airsofter"" type of airsoft gun. It is usually powered by a rechargeable battery.


AEPs are made by brands such as Well, JG, and Tokyo Marui and are decent guns. Do NOT get an EBB unless it is HIGH QUALITY.
Then finally, there is the gas gun (GBB). It uses HFC132a(weakest), Propane(strong), Green Gas(strong), Red Gas(very strong), CO2/Black Gas(Strongest). To power the gun.
Electric guns do not require cocking. If you are using a GBBR(Gas Blow Back Rifle) or standard GBB pistols, you must rack them either by the slide (pistols) or by the bolt (rifles) for every first shot. this is to chamber the first bb and set the hammer or striker. Spring guns are very reliable, but have a slow rate of fire (ROF), Automatic Electric Guns (AEGs), have a high ROF, but are trickier to maintain. GBBs have a high FPS (usually depending), can be automatic, but they are usually semi, but you need gas and you need to keep buying gas. However the gas powered (not C02) airsoft guns become exponentially less reliable in cold weather, and the plastic parts found in many cheaper airsoft guns are prone to breaking. investing in a gun with metal internals will greatly increase the reliability and performance of your gun.

, Your ""team"" could just be a group of you and your friends. There isn't any kind of registered team system, just get out there and have fun.


You and your team should agree on the ground rules that carry into any game. These should be mostly safety rules. Here are the ground rules from my team, to give you an idea:

1. Gun safeties engaged until all players have their goggles on.
2. Hands/gun in the air means ""hold your fire"" (this is useful when you don't want to pause the whole game, but your goggles have fogged up and you need to wipe them off.)
3. Define a ""safe zone."" All players who are out, or need to reload, need to stay in the safe zone. You can not fire into or through the safe zone. Safe zones need to be a place where someone can safely be without goggles.
4. 1 hit and you're out for that round.



, Paintball and airsoft fields are recommended. Have plenty of places for cover, since open areas are no fun. Woodsy places are great in the daytime, but at night tend to be too dark for the casual player. Any legal location with a well defined area is great.


Play at designated fields that are owned specifically for airsoft and or paintball.
""Backyard Airsofting"" is generally looked down upon in the Airsoft community. First of all, playing in view of other people puts you at risk of having law enforcement called by a scared neighbor. As ridiculous as that may seem, remember that if someone walks or drives by your house and catches a glance of people firing very realistic-looking rifles at each other, it is very easy for that person to panic and call the cops. Secondly, if you were to accidentally fire your gun and hit a bystander, you could get in serious trouble with the law.
Under no circumstance should you EVER play in a public area such as a park. This is the type of behavior that leads towns and cities to ban airsoft. Find private land to play on, get permission from the owner, and keep airsoft fun for all of us.

, It needs to be private property! You should inform your neighbors on what you are planning to do. If you're not sure where you are allowed to play, you can always call the local police station and ask about the laws regarding airsoft usage.

, There are some basic tactics that you should use when you are first starting out, and you may already know some of them.

, The three most common ones are last man/team standing (deathmatch), objective based and Milsim.


In last man/team standing, you just shoot each other or the other team. You and your teammates try to ""kill"" the other team by shooting them. Hits are based on the honor policy. A hit system should be worked out. Usually one or two hits and you're out; sometimes there is the ability to come back to life via a medic or respawn point. The team that kills all the members of the other team wins.
In an objective based game, you assemble two teams and each team has to either defend or attack a target, set up an ambush, the possibilities are endless. A fun option might be capture the flag.
MilSim stands for military simulation. Players sides are decided by uniform and kit. The games are story driven. Internationally these games may have up to 1800+ players and last for days.

, If you're playing your game at night, you might want to invest in some clothing for sneaking around. Camouflage is fun, but it tends to be highly specific to the kind of environment you're in. Its better to invest in some dark blue clothing for nighttime games, since dark blue will work well to blend you in just about everywhere. You must always wear some sort of eye protection! An airsoft pellet aimed at your head could take your eye out. Wear something like safety glasses or a Paintball Mask, even if you wear eyeglasses normally. You can get goggles to fit over your glasses. Always test ALL the pairs of goggles with each new gun that is added to the team, to make sure its safe. The best way to test is to set them up on top of a wooden fence or other surface. Don't perform the test in front of houses, cars, or anything else. If you can't get them off of the ground, you can set them on the pavement and kneel down. Always test at a fairly close range (6-10 feet, not point blank.)

, Stay loose and just shoot.

, Cover is an object or change in terrain that you can use to conceal/protect yourself behind or in. A prime example of cover is a trench. While a trench is good for taking cover, it's not perfect; keep in mind that it both restricts you from moving forward and back, you can generally move only parallel to your opponent (this all depends on the curvature and length of the trench.
Other than the obvious example of a trench, many things can be used as cover: A wide tree, man made cover (like some stacked tires), corners of a building, and even dense shrubs or bushes can block most if not all airsoft BBs.


Bad cover is also a thing to watch out for, bad cover is something that cannot fully conceal/block your body: like a small tree or a shallow pit in the ground. In emergency situations these are better than nothing but it's best to avoid them if at all possible. Cover is a valuable asset towards winning a match, always keep an eye out for good cover in front, behind, and to the left and right of you. this will help you when you need to move to a different place for either a better firing position, or a safer place to fall back to.

, Now, it's nearly impossible for an untrained civilian to effectively conceal themselves let alone move undetected under a trained eye, but hopefully you're not fighting professional soldiers. In airsoft concealing yourself can be as simple as staying low, slow, and quiet.


Make sure you have all gear secured and silenced (this will be hard with high-cap mags).
Stay crouched down (or even prone on a rare occasion, this isn't ideal due to the fact that it basically immobilizes you if you are discovered).
Make sure all reflective/colorful clothing or gear is covered and any lights are off. this helps you blend in with your surroundings especially if you have appropriate camouflage patterns on and you have dense tree coverage/shadow).
Be aware of all parts of your body and where they are in the space around you, including gear and your gun, which should be considered an extension of your body; this will help you from stepping on twigs/scrapping against trees/shuffling around.
Avoid an enemy's line of sight if at all possible, and if you are caught in their line of sight freeze and don't move, even if they are starring right at you they may not have spotted you. The human eye is very good at detecting any movement, but not very good at picking out a camouflaged non-moving figure. However, if they have you in their sights stay low and run for the nearest cover.

, There are a few key steps to shooting that can help you both get kills, keep from getting hit, and conserve ammo.

Select a target. First consider ""can I hit this target?"". You have to remember that airsoft BBs usually have a maximum effective range of 200 feet (61.0 m). (this is often the upper limit of even good guns), and a general effective range of 75–120 feet (22.9–36.6 m).
In order to get the maximum distance out of your gun it's best to fire a placement shot to see how you have to compensate the next shot, if it hits short you will have to aim upwards to compensate for the drop. If you can't seem to get long range shots on target within the first 5-7 shots don't keep trying, airsoft BBs aren't very predictable at long range. Always know how your gun preforms and how accurate of a shooter you are.






Learn how to fire. Make your trigger pulls with a grip rather than with a jerk, slowly pull the trigger with consistent pressure. This will help improve accuracy (which is especially important in the varying flight paths of BBs). If you have an automatic gun, fire in three-shot bursts or on semiautomatic. With single shot weapons, have your reloading process mastered, know how to operate the bolt on your bolt action, or how fast and hard you have to pull the pump on your shotgun. Also know how to operate the slide on your pistol. This will reduce reload time and keep your firing rate high.
Firing from cover. Try to fire from the side of the cover and not over the top. Firing around the edge of cover keeps more of your body covered and it makes you harder to hit.

Decide weather you want an impression loadout or a competitive loadout.,
Choose your budget.,
Choose your primary weapon and protection.,
Select your sidearm and protection.,
Select your inner clothing which includes your dress clothing and pants.,
Choose your vest.,
Choose you're tactical equipment like cameras, duty belt, flashlights, extra ammo and mags, first aid, sprays (if allowed), an extra hidden sidearm, walkie talkies, tactical gloves, radios, night vision goggles as needed, etc.

,
If you're doing an impression loadout, add patches or other materials related to that regiment you're focusing on as your impression.,
Go airsoft!",How to Create a Good Loadout for Yourself in Airsoft," Go to websites choose and see videos from YouTube regarding loadouts and finally choose you're style. An impression loadout is a copy of a real combat regiment or a real loadout of an army.;
, An impression loadout will easily fit around in a hundred dollars. But competitive may be expensive. Impressions are less practical during airsoft matches.

, Buy beginner level guns like spring rifles if you're a beginner, or you can even start with standard electric rifles. M4 can be a good start. (If you're using an impression loadout, search the gun you're desired regiment for impression uses; eg. Marines-M16). Choose a gun whose price fits as in 1/3 of you're total budget; your gear and stealth are equally important.

, A semi-automatic pistol as a sidearm will be a good start for beginners. Now choose your helmet and camo for vests, helmet and BDU (battle dress uniform) or clothing. Camo will be the pattern of you're whole loadout; if you're playing in an urban field choose a UCP (universal camouflage pattern) pattern or if playing in desert type area choose the desert camo/UCP. If you're using an assault rifle, CO2 will be a good sidearm.

, This is the place on which you're vest and other tactical gear will be placed. It should be of the same camo you chose for the helmet; a sweatshirt of the same camo is preferable as your inner clothing.

, You can buy a cheap, plate vest with pouches as a starter or a tactical vest to be more stealthy, protective and tactical. Choose the vest color, choose the color of the vest carefully; if your camo is a desert camo use tan colored vests or black vests for darker camos. You can also use the same scheme, eg. you can use ""UCP"" colored vest for you're UCP in camouflaging which is an important procedure to defend, and conclude tactical attacks on the other team.

Adjust the hop-up.,
Be sure your scope is accurate.,
Try a heavier or lighter BB.,
Get a tight bore barrel and possibly upgrade the internals.",How to Improve an Airsoft Gun's Accuracy," This should be the first thing that you do before starting to do big things like upgrading the gun or just buying a new one. The hop-up is a system that applies back-spin to BBs to make them fly straighter and more accurately. If your gun does not have enough hop-up, then it is not performing at its peak level; if there is too much hop-up, then it will not shoot accurately and the range may even decrease. This article cannot tell you how to adjust the hop-up on your gun since every type has the hop-up in a different place, but if you find it and spend the time to set it, your gun should perform much better.;
, If you have a sniper, then you will probably have a scope. If your sniper is inaccurate, then you may want to adjust the scope. There are dials on the sides of the scope that allow you to adjust that cross hairs and fine tune your sniper's accuracy.

, If you are using a .40g BB with a $10 pistol then you will want a lighter BB, but if you are using a .12g with a sniper, then you will want a heavier BB (.25+g). If you have a sniper, then you want to be using at least a .30 gram BB. (Remember, the heavier the BB the better the accuracy, but the fps will be reduced!)

, This can be tricky, but there may be videos online that will help you figure this out. If you have a sniper or AEG, then you would want to get at least a 6.03mm tight bore barrel. 6.01mm would be the ideal size, but you would have to clean it religiously because even the tiniest bit of dirt could cause the BB to get jammed in the barrel.

, This should be the person with the most experience. The Team Leader should be the final decision and out in the field as another role.

, This person will assist the Team Leader in making tactical decisions. The Tactical Officer can also play any other role.

, Here are the roles in no particular order:


Rifleman - The basic unit. They are normally a large unit that engages the enemy together. They should know basic battle tactics and be able to trust each other. This unit should be able to provide plenty of firepower and support.






A basic Assault Rifle like an M16 or an AK-47
Sidearms are recommended
Medium armor
Walky-talky / Radio


Recon - This is the faster, more versatile unit. They are the pawns of airsoft, normally the first people to go in and the first to get eliminated. This unit can be assigned to lead a charge, clear rooms, be an anti-sniper, cause a distraction, and gather information. This unit should be able to charge into enemy territory and not be afraid of getting shot.






A pistol, a sawed off shotgun, or compact airsoft rifle (MP5, AK74U, Shorty M4, etc.).
Ammo for the other infantry
Light armor for fast moving
Walky-talky / Radio


Sniper - This unit usually gets the least amount of kills because they are normally a stationary unit. They eliminate targets and, like recon, can be used to gather information. This unit should be able camouflage with their surroundings and hit targets at least 200 feet (61.0 m) away.






Sniper Rifle
Side arm is essential
Camouflage
Light armor
Walky-talky / Radio


Heavy Infantry - Also called the support gunner. They have the heaviest armor and heaviest weapons. The person/people chosen to play this role should be guys that have some scare factor in them. They shouldn't be afraid of being hit and should be comfortable without being able to use cover. This unit should be able to come when called and lay down a blanket of continuous fire that keeps the enemy's head down so teammates can move forward.






Heavy weapons like a SAW
Very heavy armor for front line defense
Walky-talky / Radio


Medic - When someone is down, the medic must come to aid them. Recon will normally assume this unit when necessary because they already have the same skill and equipment a medic needs. This unit should be able to run in swiftly and heal another player without getting hit.






Any light MG/SMG
Any armor
Weapons Sling or Holster is essential
Deck of cards or something small to tap and ""aid wounded""


Grenadier - Also called explosives expert. This unit basically loves to watch things explode so they get as close as they can in airsoft by getting tons and tons grenades and other things that go boom. This unit should be able to clear rooms and alleyways simply by throwing grenades in it.






Heavy grenades
Heavy armor
Short - Medium range rifle w/ underbarrel launcher or a Stand alone GL(M79, AT4, RPG7, MGL)
Walky-talky / Radio


Squad Designated Marksman - SDM or DMR is the long range non-sniper unit. This unit shoots from long range but is not a sniper. This means their gun should be able to go semi-auto as well as full-auto. This units rifle/s should be able to get a ranges close to a snipers but have the capability of being a Rifleman if necessary.






Long range rifle
Light armor
Walky-talky / Radio

, When you call moving your buddy starts shooting, run for 3-5 seconds. If you run longer than this a number of things can go wrong, such as somebody deciding that they aren't being shot at and risking shooting at one of you two. Your ally could hit a reload.

Check results and collect your winnings.",How to Bet on the World Cup," Understanding the origins and structure of the tournament is crucial. The first World Cup tournament was hosted in Uruguay in 1930. Since then, it has taken place every four years with the host country, selected several years in advance, given an automatic spot in the tournament. All other national teams must take part in a regional-based qualifying tournament during the two years preceding the finals, with 32 teams eventually winning their way to the big tournament. The qualifying teams are then divided into eight groups of four, split largely on the basis of world rankings, to play an initial group stage among themselves which takes place during the opening days of the World Cup. A total of sixteen teams proceed to the knock-out stage. From this point on, each game is ‘sudden death,’ with the winner proceeding to the next round and the loser being eliminated from the World Cup. As a result, an initial knockout round of sixteen is quickly whittled down to quarter-finals for eight teams, semi-finals of four teams, culminating in a final game to determine the world champions.;
, Experiencing football betting is probably the best way to understand it. You can place a wager in a traditional high street betting shop, by phone or online. Well-known betting outlets such as Coral and William Hill have successfully re-produced an exciting betting experience online. At its most basic level, you can bet on the winner or loser of an individual match. Other popular individual bets include the final score and the first goal scorer. However, the odds on these straightforward bets usually guarantee just a modest win. If you are looking for a more lucrative wager, consider multiple outcome bets. For example, a single bet on both the first goal scorer and the final score will yield greater winnings if successful. You can also find impressive odds on multiplier bets, such as the outcome of multiple matches, for which the odds of correctly predicting all results are slim. Meanwhile, special markets include the odds on the outcome of an entire season or perhaps the next change in manager.

, Betting on the World Cup should be plenty of fun with the eyes of the globe on Brazil. And there are plenty of betting options to choose from. If you are looking to have a flutter on the tournament winner, then investigate the outright markets. You can also bet on the winner of each of the eight initial groups. Of course, there is also the option to bet on any single match during the tournament. There are usually more than 100 markets available to choose from for each game. If you are interested in a more exotic bet, then check out special markets including the tournament’s top goal scorer for example or a number of team specials. England fans can bet on special markets including how many points the team will accumulate during the group stage, how far they will reach in the tournament overall and even which players will be selected in the squad.

, Placing a wager doesn't come without its risks. There is of course always the chance that you will lose your bet and this must always be kept in mind. The odds available are a huge indicator of how likely you are to win a bet. For example, the odds on Iran lifting the World Cup might look very generous, but the chances of it actually happening are very slim. By contrast, a bet on Brazil to win the World Cup might not be particularly lucrative, as it is a greater possibility. But if Brazil does win the tournament, at least you will win something, including bragging rights.

, It is vital to understand exactly how much you can afford to lose before you place a bet. Budgeting is a tricky business, especially when it comes to betting on the World Cup. It can be easy to get carried away by the excitement of one of the world’s largest sporting events, but it is crucial to impose a budget on yourself. Try deciding on a betting budget for the entire tournament and plan it out carefully as the World Cup progresses by allotting specific amounts for each stage of the tournament. If you manage to win a bet or two, it can be tempting to plough your winnings straight back into additional bets. Think carefully before doing this though, as you may simply see your winnings frittered away.

, Knowing the latest news and views as the tournament unfolds can be crucial in placing a winning bet. A new injury, team selection or inside information could well influence your next wager. Staying up to date shouldn't be too hard with huge media coverage of the World Cup. There are numerous news articles, blogs and podcasts to choose from, especially at the larger online sports books, which will keep you well informed of proceedings and their impact on the betting odds. You can usually find live coverage of all the games too at these sites, meaning that you do not have to miss a kick.

, Choosing where to place your bet can be a tricky business. There are so many sites which offer sporting odds, especially when it comes to the World Cup. Everyone has to find the right site for them. However, as a general rule, the more options on a site, the better. Not only do you get a healthy choice, but it is also a sign of reliability too. Well-known sportsbooks with an international reputation offer a varied and reliable service. Some of them, such as William Hill, even allow you to bet as the match unfolds thanks to the ‘in play’ system.

, Placing your bet should be very simple if you have selected a reputable site or bookmaker. If you are visiting a betting shop, then self-explanatory betting slips are readily available, and qualified staff should be able to advise as well. Just remember to keep a copy in order to claim your winnings. If you are betting online, then most reliable sportsbooks have a virtual betting slip which is both easy to locate and simple to slip in. Just enter your bet of choice, select the amount you wish to wager and you are good to go. Many online sports betting sites have online help, a great source for extra assistance.

, Keeping up to date and collecting your winnings is probably the most rewarding part of the process! With matches taking place pretty much every day during the World Cup and huge media coverage, you should have no problem remembering to check the scores. If you do succeed in placing a winning bet, then you can collect your winnings by simply visiting your local outlet if you placed the bet in a shop and producing a copy of your betting slip. If you had a flutter online, then the sum of money which you win will be automatically deposited in your account.

Jump in as a defender if you're strong, smart, and composed.,
Play in the midfield if you're a good passer who can run for days.,
Become a forward if you're big, fast, and love to score.,
Try out goalie if you have excellent reflexes and hand-eye coordination.,
Learn to play many areas of the field to find your perfect position.,
Understand that your available positions will depend on your coach's tactics.",How to Choose a Soccer Position1," Great defenders may not get the glory, but they win games. A good defender reads the game and offense to cut out threats before they get near goal. They are confident and physical, muscling off attackers to win the ball either in the air or on the ground. If you love frustrating the other team, leaving them empty-handed, be a defender. Natural defenders tend to be:


Tall and strong, holding their own against big forwards.
Smart and confident, knowing when to step and make a tackle and when to wait.
Good at crosses and clearances from both feet.
Effective communicators with teammates and other defenders.
Tireless, hunting down attackers throughout the entire game.;
, Midfielders are the all-around players who must do a bit of everything -- tackle, pass, shoot, hold the ball, etc. Their most important job is to keep the team together, organizing the attack and distributing the ball from the backs up to the forwards. In general, midfielders:


Run up and down the field for long periods.
Pass accurately at both long and short distances.
Remain composed and calm with the ball.
Play effectively with both left and right feet as dribblers, shooters, and passers.
Understand both defense and offensive strategies/tactics., Forwards, sometimes known as strikers, have one job: score. To do so, they tend to be big and/or fast players. They must be excellent in the air and have a high top speed to beat defenders to the ball. Good strikers are great shooters, both from the ground and out of the air, and they have an aggressive mentality that aims to score at any opportunity. Strikers prioritize:


One-on-one moves and tricks to beat defenders.
Bursts of speed and power to win the ball and shoot.
Quick, accurate shots from anywhere near the box.
Strong aerial play to win crosses and clearances.

, Good goalkeepers are like cats, pouncing on the ball the second after it leaves an attacker's foot. They must also be smart, confident players, knowing when to come out and snag a cross and when to stay in goal and wait for a shot. If you're good with your hands and quick off your feet, consider being a keeper.


Remember that being a keeper isn't just about your hands-- it is about rapid, split-second jumps and leaps to block shots.

, While the advice above is a good start, you won't know your best position until you've played all of them. Furthermore, the best players in the world can play a little bit of everything and understand the entire field, not just one spot. While body type and style are key, the most important part of choosing a position is feeling comfortable and effective.


Until you are 11-12, there is no need to pick one position, just play everywhere.In practice or pick-up games with friends, try to move around a lot. What feels comfortable? What do you enjoy playing?
Lionel Messi, based on body type, should not be a striker -- he is much too small. But his incredible quickness, foot-skills, and intelligence helped him become one of the world's best scorers.

, Tactics refer to your team's lineup and are represented by a series of numbers starting from the defenders. So, the phrase ""4-4-2"" means your team has four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards. A 3-5-3 would have three defenders, five midfielders, and three forwards. Note, however, that coaches vary the exact positions all the time, meaning you need to pay attention in practice to know what position are available to you.


Your team's formation is easiest to see right at kick-off. Where everyone starts will dictate the positions and tactics."
"
Play center back if you're big, strong, and smart.,
Play outside back if you have a good top speed and like to join the attack occasionally.,
Play as a sweeper if you like to read the field and be everywhere at once.,
Hunt and shut down key attackers as a stopper.,
Work with your coach and other defenders to nail down specific positions and responsibilities.",How to Choose a Soccer Position2," Center backs control the defense and much of the game. You must want the responsibility of directing players to help defend, keep the offside line straight as an arrow, and win absolutely every cross or shot put into the box. Center defenders are physically all-around players, but they must be big enough to challenge for every header and muscle attackers off the ball.


Center backs must have a high soccer intelligence, knowing when to step up and attack.
When they get the ball, center backs must be able to locate and distribute to the midfield.
While speed is important, it is more important to be able to read and win tackles.
While good foot skills are always important, center backs can prioritize them less., Outside backs need to be able to run down and tackle some of the field's fastest players and tend to have the speed and physicality to do so. Furthermore, outside backs will often sprint up the field during openings and counterattacks, creating an ""overload"" where there are more offensive players than defensive.


Most outside defense is one-on-one, meaning smart tackling is a must.
Outside backs tend to be good crossers, hitting long balls up and into the box when on offense.
While all positions should work on both feet, outside backs can often get away with a much stronger single foot.

, Not all coaches play with a sweeper, who sits back and covers the entire width of the field, helping out where needed. Sweepers tend to be the last player before the keeper, and must swing back and forth depending on the attack. They must also be able to read and cut out through passes before attackers can get to them.


Sweeping is very similar to playing center back, but you usually do not have a partner beside you as a sweeper -- you have a stopper in front.</ref>

, Stoppers can run all day and are quick to the ball. They are marked up on one specific players, usually a very talented forward. They stay near him/her throughout the game, rarely leaving their side, to effectively neutralize great players and take them out of the attack. A stopper is usually paired with a sweeper, who sits right behind him/her and covers the space a stopper can't., Within these three positions there is a lot of variability. This is why communication is so crucial. For example, with two center backs, are you both going to float around the middle, or is one person responsible for the left side and one for the right? Your position is much more than where you start on the field, it is how you must move around it:


If an outside back attacks, should a center back slide over to fill the empty space or will a midfielder drop back?
Who covers people on corners and set pieces. Is there a taller or more effective aerial player who might mark up on crosses even if they aren't a center back?

"
"
Work in the central midfield if you want to dictate both offensive and defensive strategies.,
Play defensive midfield if you're calm, composed, and effective under any kind of pressure.,
Play offensive midfield if you like quick combinations and long-range shots.,
Play outside midfield, or ""wing,"" if you can run for days and days at a high speed.",How to Choose a Soccer Position3," Other than center backs, perhaps, central midfielders are the most intelligent players on the field. They are always in the action, trying to win the ball back in the midfield and starting the offensive maneuvers. If a team can't control the center of the field they rarely win -- and this is your primary responsibility.


You should be able to trap and accurately pass the ball in 1-2 touches every time.
Center-mid is likely the most tiring position on the field. Endurance is key.
Tight, controlled foot-skills are a must.

, Defensive midfielders sit back a bit on offense, not because they don't attack, but because they can see the entire field. Furthermore, they come back and plug up any holes or unmarked attackers on defense, making them all-over players with a lot of responsibility.


On offense you'll often be tasked with getting backward passes and changing the field, hitting a ball over the top, or slowing down the attack to reorganize.
On defense you need to clog up the center of the field to make attacks difficult. You want to win the ball back from their midfielders and get counter-attacks started quickly., Sitting between the strikers and the center midfield (or, often, a single defensive midfielder), offensive midfielders play lots of 1-2 touch passes with other offenders to break down defenses and get shots off. They also shoot and cross a lot from outside the box, which generally pulls the defense forward to make more room for your strikers.


Offensive midfield is a hybrid position that is highly dependent on your coach's system. Some coaches like them to hold in the center of the field, making the ""last pass"" to a striker, while others want you to play as another forward who also gets back on defense.

, Outside midfielders need speed and the stamina to keep it up. As a winger your job is to get to the end line and hit a cross into the strikers, or cut in near the box and fire off shots from the outside. However, it is also your job to mark the opposing outside mid, meaning you'll be running end to end all match.


Hitting the ball across your body, from the sideline into the center of the field, is an essential skill.
Wingers tend to have decent tricks and one-on-one moves as well, helping beat their one defender and get a cross or shot off.
You must have good, tight foot skills to keep the ball near the lines. You'll run straight at the defenders, challenging them quickly for long balls or passes with very little room for error.

"
"
Become a center striker if you're big, strong, and can finish from anywhere.,
Play outside striker if you've got talented moves and lots of speed.,
Work with your partner in a paired system to stagger two strikers.",How to Choose a Soccer Position4," The center striker, on most teams, is the top goal scorer. They must be aggressive towards goal, with a wicked shot as well as the ability to put any sort or pass or cross on goal no matter the body part. They use their strength to hold off defenders and keep the ball, either to turn and shoot or to wait for support to arrive.


Center strikers must be confident with their back to goal, even if there is a defender on them.
Moves, tricks, and quick bursts of speed are all important weapons to blow by defenders.
You must not only shoot well but quickly. You should be able to fire off a shot with only a little bit of free space., Outside striker systems often don't have outside midfielders, meaning the outside striker has space to beat one defender and attack the goal. They are good crossers and good in the air, getting lots of balls from the striker on the other side of the field and sending others over. They tend to have good endurance, too, as they defensively cover the field back to half-field or further.


Speed and quickness, as well as controlled foot skills at high speed, are highly recommended.

, A frequent striker combination is to have two center forwards up together. But forwards are never effective when they're taking up the same space -- they work best when they are staggered with one above the other. The striker near goal holds the ball up, facing half-field, to draw defenders in. This creates space for the lower striker to get the ball facing goal, taking more shots.


When staggered, the top striker is usually the bigger one. He/she wins the ball out of the air, holds it, then plays off to the lower striker.
The lower striker is usually quicker, turning and facing goal with quick passes and moves and using the high striker as support."

Have some knowledge about the sport before betting.If you’re a gambler more than a sports fan, you might view sports betting as just another way to make some cash.,
Understand the odds.Odds (or fixed odds) are calculations used to determine how much you’ll earn from a given bet.,
Understand moneylines.Another way to represent odds is with moneylines.,
Understand the outcome probabilities.",How to Bet on Soccer2," However, it’s best to be informed about the teams, players, and trends within the game of soccer before betting on a particular game. Read soccer news and learn to identify matchups that seem to favor one side or another.


For instance, if one undefeated team goes up against another team that loses frequently, you would be wise to bet against the team that loses regularly. However, don’t always bet on the favorite. Betting against the favored team can yield big rewards if you win.Run a search for ""soccer betting tips"" online and do some research before betting on soccer.

, Odds are typically represented as a number that you can multiply by your total bet to figure your winnings.


For instance, assume you bet $100 on a game with odds of 1.5 in Germany’s favor. When Germany wins, you will receive $150 (1.5 times the $100 you bet).
An “odds on” wager is one where the amount you can win is less than what you bet initially. In the above example, the $150 represents your $100 bet plus $50 extra. These bets are easy to win but offer minimal payout.
An “odds against” bet is one in which the amount you win will be more than what you staked. These bets are harder to win but reap greater rewards.
Different bookmakers have different odds. Check several bookmakers to get the best odds before making a bet.

, Moneyline odds are a given number in the hundreds or thousands, accompanied by a plus or a minus.


A positive moneyline odds value indicates how much you will earn on an $100 bet. When winning a moneyline bet, you’ll also get your initial betting unit returned.
For instance, if you bet $100 on a team with +200 moneyline odds, you’ll get $300 back (your initial investment of $100 plus $200 dollars). If you bet $200 on a game with moneyline odds of +100 and win, you’ll get $400 ($100 on the first hundred you spent, another $100 on the second hundred you spent, and your initial $200 investment).
Calculate potential profits with positive moneyline odds by dividing the odds by 100, then multiplying the result by your initial stake.
Moneyline odds represented as a negative number indicate how much you must invest before earning $100.
For instance, if moneyline odds on a team are -100 and you wagered $100 and won, you’d get $200 back (your initial investment of $100 plus $100 in winnings).
Calculate potential profits with negative moneyline odds by dividing the odds by 100, then dividing your stake by the result.

, Probabilities indicate how likely something is to happen or not happen.Generally, a low value for odds means that the team you’re betting on has a high probability of winning. A high value indicates the team is not favored, and likely to lose.


The probabilities of a match’s outcome are usually defined in the range between 0% (no chance) and 100% (a sure bet).
Probabilities do not guarantee an outcome. For example, a team might be estimated to have a winning probability of 70%, but still lose.
Avoid betting on teams with probabilities for victory of 50% or lower. At that probability, you’re taking a big chance with your money.

Bet on a two-way moneyline.A two-way moneyline is a bet based on the 90 minutes of primary game time, excluding penalty shootouts, golden goals, or overtime.,
Bet on a three-way moneyline.The three-way moneyline is just like the two-way moneyline except that there is an added option to bet on a draw between the two teams.,
Place a bet on totals.Betting on totals means making a guess as to the average goal count per team in a game.,
Bet on goal lines.Betting on goal lines means making a bet based on what the difference in two teams’ scores will be.,
Make a split bet.A variation of the goal lines bet is the split bet.",How to Bet on Soccer3," In this betting arrangement, bettors will bet on one team winning and another team losing. If the team you bet on wins, you will receive a payout. If the team you bet on loses, you will have lost your bet.


This type of bet is also known as “draw, no bet.”

, Compared to the two-way moneyline, three-way bets usually have lower odds.

, These bets are usually made as “under 2.5,” “over 2.5,” or over/under some other number. This means that you are betting that the average goals per team in the game will be over or under 2.5 (or some other close value).


For instance, assume you made a bet that totals would be under 2.5. If both teams scored three goals, the total will be six. Divided by two (the number of teams in the game), you end up with the number three. In that case, you would lose the bet, since the total was above 2.5, not below.

, Like bets on totals, these bets are made as an over/under statement, typically “under 0.5,” “over 0.5,” or over/under some similar value.


For instance, if you bet “over 2.5” on a game, it means that you believe the winning team will be victorious by at least three goals.
When betting on goal lines, you usually need to call the bet as well by indicating which team you think will win. For instance, you might bet, “France +2.5 goals,” meaning you believe France will win the game by at least three goals.
Keep the over/under value relatively low. The higher the goal line bet you make, the riskier it is to win it.
This type of bet is also known as betting on point spreads.

, In this model, you might bet on over/under two close numbers. For instance, a split bet might be “over 2 / 2.5.” This means half the money you pay is on a bet that assumes the total goal difference between the two teams will be over two goals, and the other half of your money is bet on an outcome in which the difference between the two goal totals is greater than 2.5.


Sometimes you will get refunded and win the other half of the bet. If you bet over 2 / 2.5, for instance, and the game ends with a score of 2-0, you will get a refund for half the bet’s value and lose the other half of your bet, since the point spread was not over 2.5, and landed exactly on 2.

Place your bet.,
Know when to quit.",How to Bet on Soccer4," This amount -- known as your bankroll -- will vary widely depending on your income. Be honest with yourself about how much money you have to invest in betting.


When deciding how much your bankroll will be should, you should acknowledge that it’s possible that you’ll lose the entire bankroll.
On the one hand, a budget that is too high may result in personal bankruptcy. A bankroll that is too low, on the other hand, will limit your ability to reap big rewards from betting.
The “rule of thumb” for a beginner's maximum bankroll is $1,000.
Do not bet on soccer unless you have sufficient funds.

, This amount is known as your betting unit size.


Don’t place your whole bankroll on one bet. You risk losing it all at once.
Conservative or new bettors should bet about 1-2% of their bankroll on an individual bet. For instance, if you have $1,000, you might drop $10 on a single bet.
Seasoned bettors might wager 3% of their bankroll on well-founded bet.
Your absolute maximum betting unit size should not exceed 5% of your bankroll.

, Choose the game or team you want to bet on.Once you’ve registered with the gambling site or entered the casino, make a stake on a game or team you like. Do not put all your money on one outcome or one game. Distribute your risk by betting on multiple games.


Limiting your maximum bet will increase your chances to win. The “rule of thumb” for a beginner's maximum bet is $50.
If you do lose, be prepared to walk away, no matter how tempted you are to continue. You don't want to lose even more.
Never make a bet when you’re drunk or tired.

, If you win, don't get carried away. Enjoy what you've won by cashing out and coming back later. Set specific guidelines for success when betting on soccer. Your goals should be realistic and achievable.


For instance, you might decide to cash out when you’ve earned over $100.
Make rules for yourself to prevent excessive loss. For instance, you might decide that if you lose more than $100 on a game, you will stop betting and wait for another day to try again.

Watch soccer matches on TV.,
Reread the Laws of the Game, and be aware of any rule changes.,
Know the rule modifications of the league you are officiating in.,
Remain in control of your actions and emotions.,
Act appropriately.",How to Become an Excellent Soccer Referee," Nowadays, the game of soccer moves fast. This means that a referee always needs to maintain their focus on the pitch. A few seconds of watching another game could determine whether you notice a serious foul, or miss the infraction completely. Always, always, always be alert.;
, If you´re not sure about a rule, or what technique to use while officiating, ask! Asking can lead you to valuable information that you may not even know about.

, You might just be sitting at home one day, surfing the channels of your TV. Why not watch a soccer game? FIFA certified referees have officiated countless number of games, and they know the proper techniques. Watch how they signal for throw-ins, offside, corner kicks, etc.

, Sure; you may have just learned the Laws of the Game, but you most definitely will forget some of them after you pick up the dusty rulebook a few years later. Therefore, you should frequently read the Laws of the Game. Also, make sure to be informed of any alterations of the Laws of the Game. Most likely you will receive an Email, so check your Email regularly. If not, go to FIFA.com on the Internet to read any changes.

, Almost certainly you will begin officiating youth soccer teams. Many youth leagues make changes to the number of substitutions, size of the ball and field, number of players on the field, the duration of the half, etc. Ask the league coordinator or other referees to find out about any modifications.

, There has never been a referee who has not blown a call. It happens, so after you blow a call, remain cool and do not let the fans, coaches, or players get your goat. Thinking about your mistakes will just cause you to miss another infraction, or make another incorrect decision. It is very difficult to control your emotions when you are being yelled at left and right, but it will show to everyone that you can remain in control and deal with the chaotic situation. Who knows, maybe there is an assessor in the crowd watching the game. He or she just might be impressed by your ability to handle the situation.

, You are being paid to officiate the game; therefore you should behave properly. Don´t talk to your friends in the middle of the game, talk bad to anyone, or act goofy. Don’t run around with your hands in your pockets, or look bored. Simply act mature, and take your job seriously.

Simply kick the ball so that it hits the wall about 3 feet above the ground. As the ball bounces back, lift your foot into the air. Let the ball hit your foot, and fall to the ground. Do this over and over again for 10 minutes a day.








It is important to not kick the ball. You are just raising your foot to where you think the ball will bounce back. Let the ball come to your foot.
When you get the ball on the ground, put your foot on top of it to stop it from rolling away.
Start each drill up close to the wall. As you feel more comfortable, gradually move backwards. Wind up at least 30 feet away from the wall by the time the drill is done.;
, It takes even the best soccer players years to master juggling a ball. However, it is a good way to get comfortable with handling a soccer ball, and to improve your hand-to-eye coordination. Place the soccer overtop of your foot so that it does not fall off. Lift your foot up in the air, letting the ball fly upwards. When the ball comes down, kick it back up into the air with your other foot.








Make sure to hit the ball in the middle of your foot. If you don't, the ball could wind up hitting you in the face or flying off in the opposite direction. The goal is to maintain the ball near your body, about one foot away.
To keep the ball from traveling very far, bend your knees upward when you kick the ball. Extending your leg will kick the ball away from your body.
Do this drill for at least 10 minutes a day. It is okay if you only get one or two bounces at first. Keep trying and eventually your skills will improve. Try to at least get to 10 bounces before you stop the drill.

, Find a nice open field, or use your back yard. Travel around the perimeter of the field, kicking the ball gently. Make sure that you are planting on the balls (upper part, not the heel) of your feet before you kick the soccer ball. Each time you kick the ball it should only go about 1-2 feet. Do this drill for 10 minutes, or until you have traveled around the field a few times.








While soccer players use both feet to kick the ball, they also choose one as their primary kicking foot. This is usually the dominant foot, i.e. the foot that corresponds with the hand you primarily use (right-handed, use your right foot, etc.) This drill will help you figure out which foot you will primarily use to kick with.
Your non-dominant foot will use to be used to plant and balance your body. When you are dribbling, it is important that your non-dominant foot stays relatively close to your body, otherwise you could wind up kicking the ball farther than you want to.
As you get more comfortable with dribbling, try to bring your eyes upwards. Your eyes will tend to look at the ball as you are dribbling, but in a game you need to have your eyes up and looking around. It is okay if you accidentally trip over the ball in a drill, but you will gradually get used to not looking at the ball.

, While you can dribble left or right, you cannot get a sharp turn in direction merely by using the top part of your foot. This is where the sides of your feet come into play. First, dribble regularly for about eight feet. As you build up speed, get slightly ahead of the ball, and plant your dominant kicking foot. As the ball continues to roll, it will hit your planted foot, and ricochet in the direction you want it to go in.








The direction you choose to turn the ball depends on the position of your foot. For example, assuming you use a right kicking foot, you will want the ball to hit the inside of your foot to make the ball go left, and the outside of your foot to go right. If you use a left kicking foot, you will want the ball to hit on the outside of your foot to make the ball go left, and the inside of your foot to go right.
If you simply want to alter the balls course, plant your foot and hold it steady. If you wish to significantly alter the direction of the ball, move your foot against the ball, giving it an extra kick towards the direction you want it to go in.

, Find a set of cones and place them in a straight line, at least 3 feet apart from each other. Begin to dribble around the obstacles. If the cone is on your left, and you use a right kicking foot, tap the ball gently with the inside of your right foot. Kick it hard enough so that it lands to the left side of the next cone. If the obstacle is on your right, and you use a right kicking foot, tap the ball with the outside of your right foot. Make sure that the ball lands on the right side of the next cone.









These instructions are similar to people using their left kicking foot, except you will use different sides of your feet. For example, if the obstacle is on your left, tap the ball with the outside of your left foot. If the obstacle is on your right, tap the ball with the inside of your left foot.
After you have weaved through a straight line obstacle, you can change the cones up. Place them in a zig-zag formation, or place them randomly in the field.

, There are two major types of soccer passes, the ground and air pass. The ground pass is used most often, and for shorter pass lengths. Have a friend or teammate stand about 20 feet away, facing you. A good ground pass uses the inside or outside of your dominant foot, not the point of your foot.








Plant your non-dominant foot right a foot away, next to the ball. Then, swing your dominant leg back at mid-strength. As your dominant leg comes toward the ball to kick it, make sure that your dominant foot hits the ball with the inside of your foot.
The goal is to pass the ball to your teammate with out the ball bouncing. You want the ball to stay on the ground all the way to your teammate.
Pass the ball back and forth. Do this for 10-15 minutes each day. Make sure that you are aiming the ball right towards your teammate, as you will need to be accurate during a game. As you go along, you can increase the distance of your passing, from 20 feet, all the way up to 40 feet.

, The other major type of soccer pass is the air pass. This is for when your teammate is 50 feet or more away. Instead of using the insides of your feet, you will use the top of your foot. Have a teammate stand at least 50 feet away, facing you. Back up a few feet behind the ball so that you can get more power behind the pass.








As you move towards the ball, plant your non-dominant foot next to the ball, just like a ground pass. Swing your dominant leg backwards at full strength.
As your leg comes down, make sure that your dominant foot hits the ball right above your toes. This will give the ball the maximum angle and push it needs to get off the ground and travel far.
Continue to tailor the strength of the pass. You might not need the full strength of your leg in order to make the air pass successful. Try to be as accurate as possible. Continue air passing with your teammate for at least 10 minutes a day.

, When you are playing a soccer match, the defender will try to come up, pressure you, and strip the ball away. In order to prepare for this, find a teammate to run a drill with. First, you will begin dribbling normally in an open field. Your teammate will then come up and run alongside of you. Your teammate's goal will be to strip the ball away, while your goal will be to protect the ball at all costs.The best way to do this is to position your body correctly. If the defender comes up on your left side, shift your body to block the defender out. If the defender comes to your left side, move your body to the left to block the defender out.
You can also use your arms to nudge your opponent out of the way. However, do not be overly aggressive, otherwise you could wind up getting a yellow card.
Do this drill for 20-30 feet. You can then switch back and forth to get a feel for both offense and defense.

, When the soccer ball goes out of bounds on the side of the pitch where the goal is, the opposing team will get a corner kick. The goal of the corner kick is to make it curve towards the goal. Place the ball in the corner nearest where the ball went out. If you are simply practicing, you can do this in any corner. Step back at least three paces so that you have enough room to run up.Begin to run towards the ball. As you increase your momentum, plant your left foot on the left side of the ball. Swing your right leg back at full strength.
When you kick the ball, you want to make sure that it hits the upper left edge of your right foot. This will create an arc in the balls path so that it curves towards the net.
Repeat this over and over again until you have the distance and power figured out. Have a teammate go out and try to head the ball into the net, or receive and kick it into the net.

, While there is no substitute for a real scrimmage to help you practice scoring, you can do some exercises by yourself, or with a teammate. Stand about 12 yards away from the goal, the distance of a penalty shot. Use the air passing technique, except you will be ""passing"" into the goal. Move back a few feet in order to get the maximum velocity and power.








Run towards the ball. Plant your non-dominant foot on the side of the ball. Lift your dominant leg backwards at full strength. As you bring your dominant leg down, make sure that you hit the ball right above your toes.
Pick certain spots of the goal you wish to aim for. Try to get three consecutive shots to go in at that particular spot before you try another spot. You can also have your teammate stand there and pretend to be the goalie for an even more realistic situation.
Move the ball to different places on the field. Vary the strength you put into your shots depending on the different distances you choose.

, Headers are usually used when a teammate is kicking from the corner. To practice this shot, have a teammate stand in front of you about ten feet away. They will loft balls underhand towards your head. Start off by doing a standing header. This means that your feet stay on the ground. Lean back as the ball comes towards you. As the ball gets even closer, bring your head back forward.Strike the ball directly on your forehead. Do this when your head is square with your body. For example, don't head the ball if you are leaning too far back, or too far forward. Do so when your head is in the normal, upright position.
To perform a jumping header, do the same as before, except this time jump first. As you are jumping, lean your body back. Bring your head forward to meet the ball. Strike the ball with your forehead when your head is in the normal position, and when you are at the highest point of your jump.
Do both the standing and jumping header drills ten times a piece. It is important not to overdo headers as they can cause you to have a concussion over time.

, This is probably the simplest move you can perform, but the effect is tremendous. Dribble the ball forward about 10-20 feet. As you approach a defender, tilt your shoulder to the left, as if you were headed in that direction. Then move the ball 45 degrees to the right, with the outside edge of your right foot.You can do the same in the opposite direction. Fade your shoulder to the right. Then move the ball 45 degrees to the left with the outside edge of your left foot.
The defender will think you are going in one direction, and be misdirected. After you have completed the move, continue to dribble past him or her.
Have a teammate pretend to be a defender. Practice until you have at least completed the trick 10 times.

, The goal of this move is to catch the opposing player off guard. To practice, dribble with the ball a good 10-20 feet in order to build momentum. You will then want to fake like you are going to pass the ball. Take your non-dominant foot and plant it a few inches ahead of the ball. Then pull back your dominant leg, as if to kick the ball.








Instead of kicking the ball head on, you will hit the ball with the inner edge of your dominant kicking foot. Kick the ball to the side, behind your already planted, non-dominant foot.
Turn your body either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on which foot you use to kick with. Find the ball and continue dribbling in the new direction.
To practice, have a fellow teammate try and defend you. Keep the trick a secret and see if you can fake them out. Remember, this move only works when the defender is in front of you, otherwise the ball will travel right to your opponent's feet.

, Like the Cruyff Turn, this move is designed to catch your opponent off guard. To practice, dribble the ball about 10-20 feet to gain speed and momentum. Plant your left foot on the left side of the ball, about a foot to the side. pull your right leg back as if to kick the ball. When you bring your right leg down, swirl your right foot around the ball, clockwise, without ever touching the ball.After you have completed the swirl, plant your right foot on the right side of the ball. Bring your left foot back, and kick the ball to the left.
In order to get the opponent faked out to your right side, swirl with your right foot and kick with your left. In order to get your opponent faked out to your left side, swirl with your left foot and kick with your right.
You can also perform a double scissors move by first swirling with your right foot, and then swirling again with your left foot. After you have performed both swirls, plant your left foot and kick towards the right direction with your right foot.

, This move allows you to fool the defender, and power past them. Dribble the ball about 10-20 feet in order to create momentum. Plant your right foot to the right of the ball, about a foot to the side. Then, take the left edge of your left foot, and tap the right ride of the ball (both feet are now on the right side of the ball).Maintain ball control with your left foot as you spin your body counterclockwise, moving your right foot with your body.
After you have made a 360 degree turn with your body while maintaining control of the ball with your left foot, begin to dribble again. Your opponent will be caught off guard and be faked out in the opposite direction.
You can also perform this move by going the opposite way. Simply plant with your left foot, while maintaining control with your right. Spin your body, and your left foot, clockwise until you have made a 360 degree turn. Continue dribbling after that.

A good coach will know how to use these attributes to their team’s advantage. The more you win, the more you'll receive offers from bigger teams to coach.


If you don’t know how to coach all positions including, receiving, blocking, defending, catching, running, and throwing, you are severely limiting your players' development.You don’t have to be good at everything, just make sure that you have an understanding of all positions. Maintain and hire staff who will make up for your weaknesses.

, A good coach must have good communication. You should be concise with your goals to both your staff and your team. Set clear expectations and be consistent with your rules.Coaching on a professional level requires that you can choose talented staff and delegate responsibilities to create the most effective team.


This means taking your staff or player complaints seriously and potentially altering your coaching methods based off them.
Become friends with your staff so you can speak candidly and open with them.

, A coaching clinic or camp is a gathering of successful coaches with the aim of improving coaching technique and strategy.

Other coaches may know about job openings or may have vacant assistant coach positions on their teams. Always be friendly and try to meet as many people as you can.

, Having all the knowledge is a start, but you also need to have the charisma to motivate your team when they have had a difficult game or practice. Also, you must also have a commanding personality to maintain a disciplined football team. Work on listening to your players and figure out what motivates and drives them and be passionate and remain interested in their development.


Showing that you can develop an effective team will give you expanded opportunities to find a job as a coach at a higher level.

, There is an extensive library of books on football strategy and how to lead an effective team. Read books published by winning coaches to get an understanding of their training regimes, drills, and strategy.


Books that can provide practical coaching knowledge include, “Finding the Winning Edge,” “The Quick Passing Game,” “The Bunch Attack,” “The Winners Manual,” and “Winning Everyday.”There is more to being a coach than knowing a lot of plays. You must have the mentality to win and charisma to motivate a team.

, If you don’t have any previous experience coaching or playing football, then it’s necessary that you learn all of the rules before you consider coaching a team. You need to know how to score points and how to defend. You should also be able to explain illegal plays to your players so that they don’t pick up on bad habits during practice.The NFL provides their rulebook on their website.
In the NFL you can challenge a play which will reverse a referee's decision on a penalty if you are correct. Each coach gets two challenges per game and one more challenge if the first two are correct.Knowing what the rules are is essential to challenge a play.
If you’ve played football in the past, you’ll have a firmer grasp of all the rules.

, Even if you’ve watched a lot of football, you may not know the names and types of plays that exist.

However, if you want to coach youth soccer for other reasons, you'll want to choose the age group that best suits you and your own skill set.With the youngest kids, you'll be focusing on the most basic aspects of playing soccer, including ball handling.
But with 5- or 6-year-olds, your main concern will simply be getting the kids to understand what they're supposed to be doing on the field.
If you want to teach kids fundamentals of soccer, you would want to coach the oldest kids in youth soccer, who are typically 11- and 12-year olds.;
, Local public or private schools, as well as community organizations, may have the need for youth soccer coaches. Some of these positions will be paid, but the majority will be volunteer positions.In the U.S., for example, each state has its own association connected with U.S. Youth Soccer, which is affiliated with the national soccer team.
Many schools, including elementary and middle schools, also have school soccer teams. If you want to coach for a school, the requirements may be vastly different than if you want to coach for a community team.
There also may be private clubs that have soccer leagues in your area. Typically you have to be a member of the club to coach for one of these teams.

, Different local organizations will have different requirements for youth coaches. Typically you must provide personal information about yourself and submit to a background check.Visit the website of the league where you want to coach, or contact a local administrative official in the league to find out the requirements.
Typically you will be able to find a basic application to complete, so you have an understanding of what the requirements are for coaches.
At a minimum, you must pass a criminal background check and a state abuse registry check if you want to work with children.
Organizations typically have a minimum age for coaches. In most cases you must be over the age of 18, although some organizations allow teenagers to coach youth teams as long as an adult is working with them.

, Some youth soccer organizations require anyone who wants to coach a youth soccer team to complete basic training courses. This training typically doesn't cover particular coaching techniques.Since you'll be coaching young children, any required training typically focuses on safety and basic first aid.
You'll also learn the basics of watching and controlling the kids on your team, and what to do in any number of emergency situations.
Some states require you to get a license before you can coach a youth soccer team. If a license is required, you may have to take additional courses to ensure you understand the rules of the game.

, Provided you meet the requirements, typically you must next fill out and submit a paper application providing the youth soccer organization with information about yourself and the reasons you want to coach youth soccer.You'll have to submit proof that you've completed any training courses necessary, or that you have the required license to work as a youth soccer coach.
In some states, you may have to pay a small fee, typically less than $10, for the processing of your application.
Provided you pass the background check and all other information is in order, your application will be approved and you can start coaching youth soccer.

, Typically you'll receive a calendar outlining the games your team will play over the course of the soccer season. You can build your practice schedule around these games.Older kids may be able to handle practice more than one day a week, but five- and six-year-olds shouldn't practice more than once a week.
You don't want to have practice too close to games, either before or immediately after. Give space of a few days to a week between games and practice.
For example, if you're coaching the youngest kids, you may schedule practices every Monday afternoon, with games on Saturday.
However, on weeks after games, practice is on Wednesday afternoon instead of Monday afternoon to give the kids ample time to recover after the game.

, Participation is important, and your team may not be able to play if you don't have a certain minimum number of players show up to games. For this reason, an attendance policy is an important part of your team's planning.Little kids aren't going to be driving themselves to games and practices, so your attendance policy is really with their parents, not with the kids.
Set notice requirements if the kid isn't going to be able to attend a game. Typically you'll want to know by at least one game before. This way you have a practice or two to plan for the game without that player.
Avoid penalizing kids for missing games or practice, particularly younger kids. Whether they show up to practice, or show up on time, typically is not within their control.

, Understanding early childhood development can help you structure your practice sessions so they are age-appropriate. It also will help you create realistic goals and expectations for your players.You can research child development online, or look for courses offered in your community. For example, most community colleges typically offer classes on early childhood development.
These classes are usually not expensive, but if you don't have the time or resources to invest in a class, read articles online to get a sense of what the kids you'll be coaching can handle at their age.
You also can find resources on the website of your state or national youth soccer association. Typically there are coaching manuals, lists of drills that are appropriate for different age groups, and other informational articles.

, Your youth soccer league or association may already have specific rules and requirements that players must meet if they want to continue to compete on a team.However, these rules typically are the bare minimum for players to qualify for the league. As a coach, you may want to set your own rules that will encourage discipline, teamwork, and participation.
The rules may vary depending on the age of the kids you're coaching. Generally, you want to focus on good sportsmanship, teamwork, and appropriate conduct on the pitch or while on the bench waiting to play.
Make sure every child on your team has a copy of the rules and is given the opportunity to go over them with their parents before the season starts.

, Before the season starts, a meeting with your team's parents is crucial to establish your goals and expectations for the team and answer any questions the parents may have.When you meet with the parents, let them know your expectations as far as when the players should arrive at the games and practices, and what parents should do if their child will have to miss a game or practice.
Get contact information for all the parents of the players, and circulate this contact information, including contact information for yourself and any other coaches or team organizers, after the meeting. At a minimum, you need a phone number and email address for each parent.
Address playing time and how positions will be determined. Typically you should do your best to meet the desires of the players and their parents. However, if you're coaching older kids in a more competitive league this may not be possible.
You also want to cover the requirements for playing on the team, including the purchase of uniforms or travel to games, and any fundraisers or other commitments the players and parents will have.

, When you meet with parents, and throughout the season, keep the goals of participation and overall development of all players in mind. Realize this may lead to confrontation with some more competitive parents.For example, a parent may be angry that their child, who is a strong player, was pulled out of a close game and replaced with a weaker player.
Acknowledge the parent's anger and the validity of their concerns. Tell them that at this point in the kids' development, giving everyone an opportunity is more important than winning games.
For example, you might say ""I appreciate your concern, and you're right – your daughter is one of the strongest players on our team. I have no doubt we could have won the game if I had kept her in, but it's more valuable to give everyone a chance to play than to win the game.""
Remind them that part of playing sports is learning how to be gracious in defeat as well as in victory. Let them know that when the kids get older, they will have opportunities to play in more competitive leagues in which playing time is determined by skill.

, A big part of youth sports is establishing a sense of responsibility and discipline in your team members. Set an example by arriving early for games and practices, and encourage your players to arrive early as well.Typically you want to arrive at least a half hour early for practices, so you have time to set equipment up and inspect the field to make sure it's appropriate for the kids to play.
Coaches and teams should plan to arrive at least 45 minutes early for games. This allows you to warm up together as a team and give the kids a pep talk before they go out on the field.

, Particularly with older kids, youth soccer is an opportunity to teach team identity and awareness. Kids between the ages of seven and ten years old can understand the concept of putting the good of their team over their own personal needs.Describe the roles and responsibilities of each of the positions, and encourage kids to explore different positions that might be a better match for their skill sets.
The older the kids are that you're coaching, the more you'll be focused on winning games – particularly in more competitive leagues. However, you still should prioritize good sportsmanship and following the rules of the game.
Teach your players how to be gracious both in victory and defeat, and model appropriate behavior yourself. Set an example by being appropriately deferential to referees.

, To teach your players soccer skills, start with ball holding skills to teach your players to control the ball. Then you can move on to offensive and defensive drills.Particularly with younger kids, being active and having fun is more important than winning the game or becoming the next great soccer player.
Your league, or your state youth soccer association, typically will have a list of drills you can use in practice to teach your players basic skills while still having fun and getting good physical exercise.
Try to balance the focus of activities during practice so that all the players on your team have an opportunity to do something that plays to their strengths.

, You may have memories (perhaps not so fond ones) of the militaristic coach who forced kids who were late to run laps and made you run drills until you puked. These coaching styles are not favored with kids today.Stricter coaching methods can be okay if you're working with older kids in a more competitive league. These kids already have enough experience and are focused on improving their skills and becoming strong players.
However, with younger kids in particular, strict militaristic coaching can not only potentially cause injuries, it can land you in trouble with the league or with the parents of your players.
Don't use physical activity such as running laps as punishment for violating rules or doing something inappropriate in practice.
Similarly, you shouldn't withhold water or other essential nourishment from your players as punishment for poor performance.
Instead, compliment a players' performance when they are making an effort or have improved on their personal best. Focus on what the player is doing right – not what they're doing wrong.
For example, you might say ""That was a great instinct to pass the ball. Next time, call out to your teammates to make sure someone will be there to receive it."" This is more positive than simply reprimanding the player for passing the ball without looking or communicating.

, Particularly if you come from a competitive sports background, it may be hard for you to wrap your head around the concept that winning isn't everything. However, in youth soccer the most important thing is that the kids are active and involved.This means having to overcome your natural competitive instinct to win on a regular basis, but doing this ensures that the kids on your team will have a better time and get a well-rounded soccer experience.
For example, you may be disinclined to rotate players so that a small, relatively weak player moves to a leading offensive position if your team is only behind by one goal.
In that situation, if you're playing competitively and playing to win, you want the strongest players in a position to score.
However, particularly with younger kids in a community or recreation league, it's more important that everyone has an opportunity.

, When kids are just learning a sport, too much emphasis on perfection and winning can turn off even the most promising players. Instead, reward kids who constantly try their hardest and gradually get better.For example, if you're doing speed drills during practice and a kid is able to do 15 ball taps in 30 seconds, you should encourage that kid to do 20 ball taps next time around.
Measure your players' performance in connection with their personal bests, not what another kid is capable of doing.
When you have players who are struggling, focus on what they're doing right and how they're contributing to the team.
For example, you might say ""I really appreciated how hard you hustled out there today"" or ""it was good to see you communicating with your teammates.""
Keep in mind that your players are still developing, and some of them may have more physical strength and coordination than others. It isn't fair to pit them against each other.
The smallest, youngest player on the team will not benefit by having her experience compared to a larger, older player who is stronger and more physically developed.

At the end of the day there are no shortcuts to becoming an advanced player except playing and practicing frequently.Try out for the best teams in your areas. Better coaches and competition will help you improve at a much faster rate.
If you have no one to play with, go outside and shoot 100 shots against a wall, or pass back and forth. Juggle or work on your tricks in the yard. All you need to become a better soccer player is a ball and the will to work.;
, Advance players see someone, make a decision, and execute the pass, shot, or move in milliseconds. The best way to become an advanced player is to work on these quick decisions. To do so--



Don't hold onto the ball for too long. 1-3 quick touches and a pass or shot is usually enough. The longer you have the ball, the longer defenders have to get ready.
If you want to dribble, attack with pace. Make the defender react to you quickly instead of giving them time to get in position.
Let the ball do the work. You can never run faster than the ball can travel. So move the ball often, changing the field with a cross or through-pass can throw the other team into disarray.
If you lose the ball or get beaten, immediately turn and try and win the ball back, or get into position., The best players aren't limited to only one foot. If you are, other advanced players will quickly realize this and force you to use your weak foot, greatly diminishing your ability to pass, shoot, and defend. Whenever possible, focus on your non-dominant foot, even if it is terrible when you first start out. A two-footed soccer player is an incredible threat anywhere on the field.

, It doesn't matter where you are on the field, the ability to win the ball back is essential for advanced players. Individual defending (1v1) is one of the core skills of soccer players along with passing and shooting, and should not be defended. To practice, simply play against a friend, taking turns attacking and defending. Good individual defenders:


Stay low. You're on the balls of your feet, knees bent slightly, in an athletic position.
Force a direction. Put one foot forward and angle your body so that you're inviting the player to go one direction. Usually, this is towards another defender or the touch line, but it could be towards someone's weak foot if you know, for example, that they never use their left foot.
Don't stab unless necessary. Stabbing is when you lunge out to the ball. A good defender waits until they have a good opportunity -- like the ball pops a little too far forward or the attacker gets too close.
Watch the hips. The belt-buckle almost always telegraphs where a player is going. Feet will move rapidly (especially for tricks) and bobbing or shifting heads and shoulders are often used for fake outs. The belt buckle, however, is roughly a player's center of gravity and is very hard to change on the fly., Practice is where you get better, not where you keep repeating the skills you've already got down. You should be making mistakes in practice, trying out your opposite foot, playing a role you don't normally play (such as working on individual defending as a striker), and working out new combinations and passes with teammates. The best players aren't afraid of embarrassing themselves at practice -- they want to embarrass the other team during the game.








, A great way to learn is to watch someone who is more advanced than you, do it. If you play a specific position, you should focus on the player who is playing your position and take note of the things that they do. Where are they when they don't have the ball? How often do they push forward or drop back on defense. What kind of passes are the looking for?The European leagues, like La Liga, the English Premier League, and the Bundesliga are often the best places to start, as well as international tournaments like the World Cup.
You can also buy or borrow soccer tapes. These tapes break-down different drills and tactics that will help you become an elite player. They are very easy to follow and have proved to be extremely helpful to soccer players all over the world.

, Your coach is there for a reason, and they can often see things that you cannot while you're playing. Learning to take and use the advice given to you by your coach will prevent you from repeating the same mistakes over and over again, and will help you find your weak spots.Once or twice a season, ask your coach what you can do to improve. Where does she/he think you can get better, and what sorts of drills or ideas can your practice on your own. This is a great way to constantly find new ways to improve.
Hire an individual trainer or coach if you have different goals than that of the team(s) you are on. Many very well qualified coaches or college soccer players train individuals by the hour and are relatively cheap. This direct attention on the player and their needs is an excellent way to become a great player much faster.

Learn to dribble with every part of your foot.,
Pick up your head as you dribble.,
Work on ball handling exercises.,
Practice passing on a dime.,
Perfect some advanced moves.,
Follow a training schedule.",How to Become an Advanced Soccer Player2," Practice dribbling in a thirty-yard area, varying your speed and the part of your foot used to move the ball. You want the ball to feel like a natural extension of your feet, stopping, moving, and changing direction at will. Some ways to practice this include:










Obstacle courses: Set up cones or small objects in zig-zag lines, then dribble through them with the most controlled speed you can. Your goal is to get through all the cones without hitting any or missing them. As you get better, pick up the speed.

Juggling: Although this is not directly used in the actual game of soccer, being a better juggler will improve your 'touch' and overall comfort with the ball. Juggling is simply using your whole body (minus arms and hands) to keep the ball in the air as long as possible. Start trying to get 10 touches in a row, then move up to 20, 50, and 100., This requires great foot skills, but you should start working on it as soon as possible. Advanced soccer players intuitively know where the ball is at their feet most of the time, allowing them to look up and find the next pass or shot opportunity. Though you will always look down occasionally, the more you can keep your head up the better you'll be.


Practice picking your head up with every dribbling drill you do, especially in practice., These simple, quick exercises are a great way to work on your foot skills, even if you would never do the actual movement in a game. For all of them, get your feet moving as quickly as possible while remaining in control.








Bounce the ball in between your legs as if you are rapidly passing the ball from the inside of your right foot to the inside of your left. Work on using small movements to ""chop"" the ball back and forth.
Do toe taps by leaving the ball in front of you and alternating touches on the top of it with the bottom of your foot. To get fast, try and land on the balls of your feet each time, and keep your knees slightly bent.
Put the ball between your legs. Roll the bottom of your right foot on top of the ball, carrying the ball to the right. Once you've rolled over the ball, bring your right foot back to the center, passing the ball to your left foot and repeating. You can also do this in reverse, rolling the ball to the inside, pushing it to the right with the outside of your foot, then chopping it back to the center. This drill, though advanced, is a great way to practice total control., The best soccer players know that soccer is a team sport. Dribble too long and you will turn the ball over, every time. Thus, you need to spend the same amount of time practicing your passing as your individual foot skills. You should be able to make quick passes with one touch (not stopping the ball as it rolls to you), and be able to set up and hit a good cross in just two touches.Hit up against a wall for quick, easy passing practice. The worse your pass, the harder it will be to retrieve the ball and hit one back.
Get a friend, usually a striker, to work on crosses with you. Stand in the corner and have your friend point out where they are going. Have them start running, then hit the cross to them so that they don't have to break stride to get the ball.
Think about your weak areas and make a commitment each week to fix them. For example, if you want to work on shots, pick 2-3 days a week to go to the field and shoot for an hour. Once you feel good, use the same time to work on dribbling, or crosses, or some other advanced skill you need to practice.

, Warm up by spending your time with the ball alone: Dribble much faster with accuracy. Keep your head up slightly as you dribble the ball so you can see the field. Here are some popular moves which you should learn:










Flip Flap/Snake/The Ronaldhino

Move the ball with your outside foot to the outside, then quickly flip the ball back with the inside of your foot.
Your foot will wrap around the ball, pushing it away from you then bringing it back, fooling the defender.



Stop and Go

Jog slowly with the ball.
Stop for a moment, placing the bottom of your foot on the ball
Then, roll the ball forward and to the side of a defender, then take a big touch and run past the frozen player.



Scissors

Bring your foot over the top of the ball, faking like you're going to push it or pass it.
Once the foot is over the ball, bring it back, catching the ball on the way and going to opposite direction from the one your faked.
You can do this with the inside or outside of your foot.



, This should be a ritual, and not something you choose to do on certain days or at certain times. Training with a soccer ball 3-4 times a week will definitely improve your skill. Volley against a wall, or practice shooting with both feet on a trampoline or goal, if you have one. Practice foot skills, and juggle. Juggling will help with ball control. You should do this with both feet, so you are comfortable with both feet. Also, shoot and volley with both feet.









Many coaches recommend spending 30 minutes or more on skills every single day.

Focus on reaching ""match-fitness."",
Increase your speed with sprint workouts.,
Try full-body workouts.,
Work out your core and upper body, not just your legs.",How to Become an Advanced Soccer Player3," Match-fitness means that you could play a full game, usually 90', without significantly tiring out and losing your skills. Soccer is a quick moving, constant game that requires a lot of endurance, and your first benchmark should be to run for at least 45' without tiring. There are a lot of ways to practice this:To work on endurance, run 2–3 miles (3.2–4.8 km) 2 times a week and time yourself. Try to improve this each week, slowly working up to 5–6 miles (8–10 km) each run.
Play games. The best way to get match fitness is to play matches. These don't have to be full games -- 3 v 3 for an hour is an incredible way to get real, game like endurance training.
Tire yourself out every practice. Practice is where you build your endurance up in preparation for games. If you're practicing hard, tiring yourself out, you get your body used to performing with less energy, making you more effective later in the game.
Try interval training. This is when you alternate jogging and sprinting on a run, usually jogging for twice the amount of time you sprint, without stopping for any breaks. This is a great way to simulate a game when you're training all alone., To improve your speed, work on sprinting. Find a soccer field, start from the goal line and sprint to midfield, from there jog to the next end line. Repeat this step then walk the length of the field to cool down. Do this as long as possible until you are too fatigued to continue or for about 15 minutes.


Speed is partially determined by genetics, but the time it takes you to hit top speed and your ability to keep sprinting is determined by your training. The more you work, the faster you'll get., Some exercises considered useful for all ages are leapfrogs, wheelbarrows, and lunges. When doing leapfrogs; start from a squatting position and leap as far as you can, rest for a couple of seconds and then repeat. When lunging start from the standing position, step forward as far as you can with one foot and touch the ground with your knee of the non-stepping foot. Then put your weight on your foot that you first stepped with and now step forward with your opposite foot and touch the ground with your other knee. Continue to do this down the length of the field. You will need a partner to do wheelbarrows. Have your partner standing while holding your ankles. You should be in front of them with only your hands touching the ground. You should both walk simultaneously (you with your hands and your partner with their feet) to midfield. Switch positions at midfield. Do all of these exercises 2-3 times down the field, you will drastically improve your leg/abdominal strength.

, Just because you can't use your hands doesn't mean you shouldn't work out your arms. Having great full-body strength means you can fight hard for loose balls, resist tackles from defenders, and jockey for position on headers. While you don't want to turn into The Hulk, light upper body toning is essential for great players. Light weight-training is perfect for soccer players at any position. Work on the following muscle groups 3-5 times a week.



Chest and Back: These muscles are essential for remaining strong on the ball and in the air. Work on 100 push-ups a day, and do as many pull-ups as you can do, completely in sets of 3.

Tone your arms: Basic bicep curls, dips, diamond push-ups (with your hands touching under your chest), and pull-ups are great ways to get upper-body workouts without heading to the gym.

Abs and Core: Essential for every position. Your core is how you transfer energy from your upper body to lower, essential for tight turns, big shots, powerful headers, and trapping. Sit-ups, crunches, and planks are an essential part of your workout, performed daily until you are too tired to continue.

Continue to learn about the sport.,
Keep in mind that winning isn't everything.,
Work on building confidence in possession with passing, moving and close-control mini drills implemented into your training sessions.,
Develop young athletes into all-around players.,
Keep in mind that with the modern rules of football, meaning keepers cannot pick up balls passed back to them, developing the first touch and passing of goal keepers is equally important.,
Lay down the rules and stick to them.,
Make sure before the season starts that all parents and athletes are aware of the rules and sign a statement stating so.,
Get help.,
Be prepared.",How to Become a Better Football (Soccer) Coach," After all, as a coach you are telling your athletes that practice makes them better, so why shouldn't it be the same for you? Study videos and go to specialized websites to learn new training drills and techniques. Even if you don’t use what you see, an hour a week studying them gives you extra knowledge of the game and will at least give you some ideas of your own.;
, Don't be pressured into trying to win, over trying to become better. If you're winning more games, you must be making the players better, right? That's not necessarily true. Winning is a good encouragement for the players and confident players with a winning mentality will play better, but don’t be tempted to just place the fastest, most skillful players up front and hoof the ball up to them every time. This may heed good results at the end of the game, but it doesn't help develop the skills needed for the athletes to progress.

, Playing like this is difficult to master, especially for younger athletes, but once passing and moving is second nature to them, winning won’t be a problem.

, Just because certain players have the skills that allow them to play a certain position well does not mean that you should limit their progress by labeling them. Rotate your team around, play some of your speedy wingers or strikers in defense. If you can make them realize that it is harder to defend when being put under pressure then they can implement that into their game when moved back to an attacking role.


Younger defenders generally try to get rid of the ball the moment they are put under pressure and if all of your players constantly put pressure on the opposition you team is guaranteed to gain more throw-ins corners and shooting opportunities.
On the flip side, have your defenders play in a more advanced role to help them develop their passing and control. They will not be the defense that crumbles under pressure.

, Some of the best keepers in the world almost play as an outfield player in the old sweeper style, rushing out to clear balls over the top of the defense or offering themselves as an outlay for the defenders being put under pressure and providing good football distribution themselves.

, This step is equally as important for you, the athletes, and if dealing with younger athletes, the parents.


When dealing with younger children (10 years or below) it is important to give them as much playing time as possible to help develop their skills and confidence.
Although it is still important as the athletes get older (11 to 14) to give them time on the pitch, it is equally important to ensure that correct attitude on the training ground and with each other is rewarded with team selection. This can be a difficult age to manage as the young athletes are at a stage of their life where they are trying to establish their own personalities and this can result in them being disruptive, lazy or egotistical (i.e. thinking they are the best player on the pitch and arguing with team mates to give them the ball constantly).
Hopefully with the groundwork in place by the time the players begin to become fully formed athletes (15+) they will have the strength of character and understanding that, if they are not getting selected for the team on a regular basis then the best solution is to work hard and force your way back into the team.

, The important thing to remember is there are three interested parties all after different outcomes:


The parents will generally want their children to play every minute of every game and be the star striker destined to be playing for Barcelona one day.
The children will just want to have fun with their friends and improve.
As a good coach, your agenda should be to make the athletes the best possible players they can become. This does not always result in getting the best results (at least not to start with) but you must stick to your promise the same way as you expect the athletes and parents to. Make sure you are prepared and have a plan for your training sessions. Turning up every week and just playing a match every training session because ‘it’s what the athletes want’ is a failure for you, them and football in general.

, If you are trying to coach 12+ athletes together half of your training session is going to be spent explaining the drills and trying to keep an eye on everyone at once. What happens if you need to have a 1 on 1 with an athlete? do the rest stand around and wait for you to finish? Get a couple of parents to volunteer allowing you to oversee the whole session. If you don't feel comfortable using parents, visit the local college, university or football team, there are always enthusiastic young sports students willing to volunteer.

, Take courses, plan sessions, listen to others. You may know a lot about football, you may even know a lot about coaching, but do you know how to adjust and get this over to, say, a bunch of 8 year olds.

With speed, you would be able to bomb down the wings like Ronaldo or Messi. To improve your speed, follow the steps laid out in this section.;
,,, This should result in you running at full speed in a forward motion.

, You should find that your speed will increase in about a month or so. This method is widely used by many athletes to beef up their speed.

, Another physical attribute that a good winger should possess is stamina. A way to build this up is through swimming and frequent long distance jogs at high altitudes. The former increases lung capacity while the latter increases the amount of red blood cells that your body produce. These types of exercise increase the amount of oxygen you can take in your lungs with a single breath.

, No winger would be complete without good dribbling and agility. How to build these up? Simple––follow the suggestions in this section.

, A good place to do it would be in your own home. But please avoid any damage to any thing or person.

, The more you do, the better your ball control will be. Ball control is essential for dribbling.

, As for agility, you can do shuttle runs on a weekly basis. Try to time yourself every time you do it and make an effort to beat your timing at every attempt.


Also, you could learn some dribbling moves through viewing tutorial videos on YouTube.

, You need to be able to cross, pass, and shoot with both feet. Many of the world's greatest wingers are two-footed and are so dangerous because they are able to cut in and shoot or drift wide and cross. Work on using you weak foot to control, pass, and shoot the ball. It may feel awkward at first, but eventually, you will get used to it and it will feel natural., Run to the space and do this very frequently.

, Place yourself there regularly at right moments.

, If in wing position, cross or dribble and shoot or pass.

Measure your current vertical leap.,
Jump rope.,
Do squats.,
Build up your calf muscles.,
Start weight training (optional).,
Use your arms for momentum.,
Practice your jump.,
Visualize your jump.",How to Increase Your Vertical Leap," Stand near a tall wall or pole, and raise your hand as far as you can. Have a friend measure where your hand reaches up to (make a mark with chalk or a similar marking tool). Then, jump with that same hand raised, and have your friend try to measure where your fingertips hit the wall. (Your friend might need to stand on a stool, chair or small wall to do this; just be careful not to jump into him or her.) The distance between these two measures is your current vertical leap.


As you improve, remeasure at intervals. Being able to track your progress will help you gain confidence in training and keep pushing for more.;
, It might seem too obvious to be true, but jumping rope regularly will strengthen the muscles you need to execute a vertical leap. Jump on a hard surface with plenty of room over your head for the rope, and try to fit in 15 to 20 minutes per day.









Don't ""skip"" rope, where you essentially jump with one foot in a sort of running-in-place motion. Instead, try to keep your ankles together as you jump with both feet at the same time.
As you improve, jump faster. You might start out moving the rope slowly, taking a small hop between jumps to maintain your balance. When you're ready, move the rope more quickly and get rid of the balance hop.
If you're not able to jump rope, try running up and down stairs. It's a comparable workout, and hits a lot of the same muscles.

, A good squat should feel like it's working the entire lower half of your body, as well as stretching the core muscles around your back and abdomen. Here are some exercises to try, in order of intensity:









Do a basic squat. Place your feet hip-width apart, and keep your heels flat on the ground. Slowly lower yourself as far as you can by simply bending your knees––keep your back erect and your neck straight. Lift back up to starting position. Start out with 3 sets of 10 squats.
Add weights to your squat. Place your feet hip-width apart, and put a set of hand weights between them (start out with a 5 lb. weight. If it's too much, go down to a 3 or 4 lb. weight; if it seems too easy, ramp up to 7 or 8 lbs.) Squat down as you would for a basic squat, but pick up the weights at the bottom of your squat. As you lift yourself out of the squat, rise to a full standing position with your arms raised straight up toward the ceiling. As you squat back toward the floor, lower your arms so that you're back in starting position––in a full squat, with the weights between your feet and your arms bent. Start out with 3 sets of 5.
Jump out of a squat. Place your feet hip-width apart, and squat as low as you can. Instead of rising back up slowly, though, jump from squatting position and try to turn 180 degrees. Come down from the jump in another squat––don't try to land standing straight up. Repeat, changing directions when you jump (for instance, turn to the right the first time, then turn to the left, and so on). Start with 3 sets of 5.

, There are a lot of exercises you can do to bulk up your calves, but here's a classic one:









Stand on a curb or a step, so that the balls of your feet (underneath your toes) are on the step, but your heels are not.
Slowly raise yourself a few inches (centimeters) by standing on your tip toes. All your weight should now be on the balls of your feet, and you should feel the pull in your calves.
Slowly lower back down to starting position. Doing this exercise slowly is what makes it work––you won't get the same effect out of bouncing up and down quickly. If it helps, time yourself; for example, each raise and lower should take a total of 6 seconds. Count out the seconds as you go.
Repeat the exercise as many times as you can. Twenty times is a good goal to start with.

, Get access to a gym where you can do leg curls and lifts with commercial weight-lifting equipment. Set the weight as high as you can without injuring yourself, and aim for 4 or 5 reps. Repeat when you feel able.









Note that high-weight, low-rep strength training is the best for building up central nervous system and focuses on hypertrophy (growth of muscles) less. If you want more muscle, train with moderate weights and moderate (around 6-12) reps.

, Start with your arms at your sides, bent at the elbow. As you jump, raise your arms above your head.








, Every few days, try a few vertical leaps to track your progress. Don't focus on vertical leaps as your primary means of training, though; doing them over and over will result in slower progression than doing the exercises above. If you can, have a friend mark your jumps so you can track your progress.








, The jury's out on whether visualization can improve athletic performance, but it can't hurt to try. After you've worked out, while your muscles are still throbbing, close your eyes and picture your perfect vertical leap. Imagine yourself exploding up from the floor and hanging in the air at the height of your jump before coming back down.

;
, Do as much as you can starting out, you'll need to start getting a feel for how the ball moves and responds to the force you put on it. It's also a good idea to exercise with each hand by itself to get comfortable going to the right and to the left. Alternate bouncing it quite hard and quite softly.









A good dribbling exercise to start with is to dribble twenty times in a row with your right hand and then switch and dribble twenty times in a row with your left hand. Do three sets of this when you start a basketball routine and three sets of this at the end.
Stay still at first, but keep your knees bent and bounce on your toes to stay moving. When you get comfortable dribbling from a stationary position, do this same exercise while walking. When you get comfortable walking, start running.

, This is called a crossover. Start dribbling down the court or in your driveway in a zig-zag pattern: go forward and right for two steps and then bounce the ball over to your left hand and go forward and left for two steps. When you get that down, do the same thing backwards.









Set up a row of cones fives yards apart in a straight line to dribble around.

, One of the most important skills to learn in the early stages of dribbling is to dribble without looking at the ball. It's hard at first, but eventually you'll need to feel the ball without needing to see it. Pick a point (like the rim of the basketball hoop) to fix your eyes upon as you start dribbling and run through your dribbling exercises.








, Learn to 'feel' where the ball is at all times, have control over it, and be able to do anything you can with it.









Try not to let the ball touch your palm. A good dribble comes from your fingers.
Spend any free down time you have dribbling the basketball. Dribble up and down the court or wherever you're practicing. Dribble a basketball when you walk to school or to your friend's house. It's very important to practice as much as you can.

, Think of power-dribbling as the ""run"" in crawl-walk-run. When you're first starting out, your biggest concern is making sure the ball comes back close to your hand, but eventually you need to make sure the ball comes back to your hand as quickly and with as much force and control as possible.









It's all in the wrist. To develop your power dribble, alternate bouncing the ball as you normally do and then with a few degrees more power. Don't bounce it so hard you lose control: bounce it firmly several times in a row without letting your arm come way up when you dribble it back down, then alternate back to a casual dribble.
Try dribbling in the dirt. You'll have to bounce the ball extra-hard to get it to come back at the same speed you're used to. When you get used to that, move inside and dribble like you've been dribbling before.

, A crossover is the dribble that alternates the ball between the hands. A quick crossover makes it harder for a defender to steal the ball or force you out of your movement. In the late 90s, Allen Iverson was known for his extremely fast and powerful crossovers.









Start by power dribbling four times with your right hand and make the fifth dribble a hard crossover to your left hand. Do the same thing with your left. Then, make it three before the crossover, then two, eventually switching between your hands a few times with your power dribble, then build it back up.

, Run suicide sprints on the court while power dribbling. Dribble from the baseline to the free-throw line and back, then dribble to the three-point line and back, then to half-court and back, then the full court. Every time you reach a point, touch the line.








, When you're getting really confident in your power dribbling, try to dribble two balls simultaneously. This helps ingrain the dribbling and make it subconscious. If you can power-dribble two balls simultaneously all the way down the court, you'll be in great dribbling shape.








, This mnemonic device should help you remember the fundamentals of shooting the basketball:


B=Balance. Make sure you are balanced before you shoot. Your feet should be planted at shoulder-width, your knees should be flexed, and you should be ready to jump
E=Eyes. Keep your eyes on the basket while you shoot. Imagine there is a dime balancing on the front of the rim and that you're trying to knock it off with your shot.
E=Elbow. Keep your shooting-elbow tucked in towards your body when you shoot.
F=Follow Through. Make sure you follow through with your shot; your shooting hand should look like you are about to reach into a cookie jar on a high shelf.
C=Concentration/Awareness. This is the most important part of shooting. Focus on where the ball is going. Once you've made the decision to shoot, commit to it and focus on making the shot.

, The shooting motion is almost entirely in your dominant hand, so practice that way. If you're right handed, the purpose of your left hand is to stabilize the ball as you prepare to shoot. It's only there to make sure the ball doesn't slip out of your right hand. Although you need to make sure you don't use this technique while playing a match; it will most certainly lead to a faulty shot, and has very less chances of actually going in.









Use the pads of your fingers and hold the ball so you see light through all of your fingers. As you shoot, push the ball toward your target while rolling it back toward you. This is called ""English"" or ""spin.""
Practice this while lying down. Shoot your basketball straight into the air so it comes back down onto your hand. You can do this for hours, while listening to music, or when you're having trouble sleeping. The ball should feel like part of your arm, extending into the hoop.

, Using the proper form, you should make a lay-up every time. Practicing lay-ups especially with your non-writing hand is a great way to make you a more versatile player.









Dribble toward the basket from the three-point line at a diagonal. When you get to the lane line, you'll have two more steps to the hoop. If you're on your right, dribble one last dribble when you step on the lane line with your right foot, then plant and jump from with your left. If you're on the left, do the opposite.
On your right side, bring your right hand up with the ball in it and your right knee up at the same time. Imagine your elbow was attached to your knee with a string. Lay the ball off the backboard by aiming at the top right corner of the box behind the rim. Don't try to bounce it off with any force--your momentum coming in and up should do most of the work.

, Once you've got the mechanics of your shot down, practice shooting from different parts of the court. For this exercise it helps to have a friend or teammate grab your rebounds and pass the ball back quickly. This drill involves at least 7 positions, but you can tailor it to your needs. You have to make each shot before you move to the next position on the court. Do it as quickly and with as few shots as possible.


Start by shooting a lay-up. Run immediately to the baseline at a point in between the lane line and the three-point line. Have your friend pass you the ball and keep shooting from there until you make it. From there, run to a point in between the corner of the lane and the baseline and shoot again. Then move to the corner, then the free-throw line. Keep moving around the lane until you've made your way around.
Expand the game to include the same points on the three-point line when you're consistently making shots in the lane. Like Brennan Idor.

, An undefended shot, free-throws are the purest display of shooting mechanics. You can't let your feet leave the ground, so you've got to perfect your motion and your accuracy.









See how many free-throws you can hit in a row.
Practice shooting free-throws when you're cold and when you're totally winded. If you can consistently make free-throws while breathing heavily after running lines or doing dribbling drills, you'll be in good shape for a game.

, It's never going to be easy to get off a clean shot. If you've been practicing by yourself and making all kinds of shots from all distances, it can be quite a shock to get in the game and hit nothing but bricks. A defender hurries you, gets in your face, and will try to steal or block your shot.









A quick turn-around or fade-away shot will require you to over-correct with your arm for going backwards. You'll lose the strength you get from pushing off with your legs.

, When you call your shots, it's tempting to shoot the easy ones, but when you've got someone else picking where you shoot, things can get a lot more interesting.








, The first step in developing your defensive game is in your stance.


Keep a wide base with your body weight on the balls of your feet. Keep your butt down and your hips back.
Your arms should be always up and out. Don't reach in or touch the offensive player too much or you'll be called for fouls. Use them to distract the player and try to block passes and shots.
Focus your eyes on the player's waist and chest, not the ball. This will give you more of an idea where he will try to go.
Make sure that you don't focus on the opposing player's stomach or feet. They will beat you to the basket every time if you do so.

, A common basketball practice drill will include shuffle-stepping (moving quickly sideways) down the court and back. Practice switching directions by having a teammate dribble left and right. Move back and forth in the defensive stance while mirroring the movements.








, Push the offensive player toward the sideline by putting your lead foot in between his lane to the hoop. So, if he's coming down the middle, push him to the left by leading with your right foot. You want to close off the access to the lane and to the basket, so trying to push the offensive player toward the side will mess up the offensive plan.


Have a teammate dribble down the court from one baseline to the other. Play defense with your hands behind your back, forcing the dribbler to change directions with your feet. You'll need to quickly shuffle step down the court to stay ahead and direct the person with the ball.

, A common mistake players make is jumping too often to try to block a shot. When you're off your feet, you're less useful as a defender. If you think the person you're guarding is going to shoot, raise your hands in the air, but don't jump. Disrupting the view of the basket can be just as effective in making the shot miss as blocking it.

, When rebounding box out and slip in front of another rebounder to intercept, always box out.

, It may sound obvious, but making crisp and accurate passes can be the difference between a good team and a collection of individual players. Even if you're all talented individually, learning to work well as a unit is necessary for success on the court. Team drills will help your group become efficient passers:









Simulate a fast break. In a group of five, move all the way down the court without dribbling the ball, letting the ball touch the floor, or moving your feet when the ball is in your hands.
Play hot potato (literally). Having someone control some music playing in the background and pause it suddenly. Whoever is holding the ball when the music stops is out. You should be passing quickly and and crisply, without dribbling. As you as you get the ball, look for someone to pass it to.

, While it may be fun to drop back for a three-pointer every time your hand touches the ball, it's typically not the job of the center to do that. Talk to your teammates and your coach to find out where you need to be on particular plays.









The point guard is the court general. At this position, you need to see the court and set up the offense. You need to be a selfless passer and good shooter. You also need to have a good handle of the ball and court vision.
The shooting guard is the back-up to the point guard. Usually, this is the best shooter or offensive player on the team.
The small forward is the most versatile. You need to be a good shooter with the ability to go up for rebounds on offense or defense, and good vision to be able to kick the ball back out to the guards to set up the offense again.
The power forward is a good defensive player, shot blocker, and an excellent player in the lane. This is maybe the most physical player on the team.
The center is (among other things) probably the tallest player on the team. You should also be an excellent rebounder and passer, with the ability to control the lane game on offense.
Use other players for inspiration. When you watch an NBA or college game, specifically watch the players who play the same position you do. Where is the power forward while the shooting guard takes a three-point shot? What does the guard do while the center goes up for a rebound on offense?

, A pick is set when you're on offense and block a defensive player with your body to allow your teammate a clear lane with the ball. You need to have your feet set cleanly and be static, or this will be called a foul. It requires a great deal of communication with your teammate, who should drive the defensive player into your pick, instead of you driving yourself into the player.









Stand still and up straight, your hands clutched at waist-level in front of you and your feet flat on the floor. Let your teammate come around you. Be strong, and be prepared to absorb a blow.

, The goal of a play should be to break through the defense and get the ball to an open player for a shot. Give basic pick patterns names and let the point guard run them on offense. Practice these with cones for defenders and get your timing down.









The most basic play is for one of the forwards to come out and set a pick for a guard. The guard then drives to the inside lane and kicks it back to the forward, who should be either open, or matched with the (probably) shorter defender originally guarding the guard.

, A full-court game of basketball includes a lot of running. Players not accustomed to the running will become winded very quickly. You don't even have to be the best defender or shooter if you can outlast your opponents on the court. Here are some running drills to work on and get your stamina up:









Superman Drill. On a court, start on one baseline and run to the nearest free-throw line. Drop and do 5 push ups on your fingertips, then stand and run back to the original baseline, then run to the three-point line, drop and do 10 push ups and continue on that same idea for every line on the court, back and forth, until you reach the first line again. Shoot at least 10 free throws after the drill while you are tired.
""Kill Drill"": this is a full court, down and back timed drill. If you're really out of shape just start with maybe 4-6 ""down and backs"" in 1 minute 8 seconds (starting at 1 baseline running to the other and returning to the original). Sounds like a sufficient amount of time until you run the 160 feet (48.8 m). After you build up some stamina, try 13 down and backs in 68 seconds. Again, shoot at least 10 free throws while fatigued.

, Official NBA rules are available for free online, so it helps to brush up on them before playing the game. You may find something clarified that you’d misunderstood.


Talk to other players, check websites, ask coaches for their tips. Knowing the historical rules also helps too. Watch old games, watch streetball games, read about the invention of basketball.

, Look for the open player and pass the ball. Don't hog the ball when you've got it and try to take low-probability shots that waste your team's chance at points.








, If you're fast, and agile, and can jump, you can get rebounds even over a taller player. Most super tall guys don't put all their effort into rebounds since they don't have to. You can beat them if you work at it.


Try jumping rope. Jump rope as fast, long, and hard as you can. The better you can do this, the faster footwork you can have on the court.

, You will be amazed at how much better you can palm the ball if you have strong fingers. Even if you think you don't have large enough hands to palm the ball, it can be done if you have stronger fingers.

, If you have a strong core you will be able to take a hit and still finish strong at the rim.

Quarter Backs: Quarter Backs need to have excellent arm strength, an ability to run (at least a decent run), and the ability to take a hit. You can train for all these by lifting weights and practicing your passes (arm strength), running ladders or taking short runs (speed), and exercises focused around the chest (ability to take a hit.)

Running Backs: Running Backs need to rely on a number of things. Speed, agility, carrying the ball, awareness, and the knowledge they are tackled frequently. Common activities such as running, practice dodging objects, and playing against friends will help build all these key strong points.

Wide Receivers: Wide Receivers need to have speed, agility, and the ability to catch and be tackled. General exercises can build strength, such as pulls ups or weightlifting. Catching is a skill that you can learn by yourself or in a group (groups work best.)

Defenders: Defenders, especially lineman, need to be all muscles and very large. As a lineman, you will get pushed around a lot, and have to tackle people a lot as well. Getting muscular and large is easy.

Kickers and Punters: Leg strength is about it. You will get pushed down sometimes, but not often. Doing leg exercises and practicing your kicking is all you need to do.;
, You need to be fast incase you have to catch the ball, you can run ladders to develop speed.You need arm strength in case you have to be on the defensive side.Lifting weights is easy.


Offensive Linemen: Lots of leg strength is needed. When you block someone, you not only are aggressive with your arms, but you need to be able to fire into the defensive lineman and drive your legs to move him back. You should be big and able to throw your weight around. Muscles are a plus. You also need quick and fast feet for blocking.

, If you want to be good and ready, you need to be above all your competition. Only a few people can make that position, and there can only be one starter. If you want it to be you, you have to be the best in your group.








, Exercising too hard could hurt you and hurt your chances of making the team. Work hard, but know your limits.








, This will also give you hands on experience and a feel of a what a game situation is like.

Learn from the NBA’s greatest point guards.",How to Be a Point Guard," At a very basic level, the point guard is responsible for moving the ball up the court, keeping it in his team's possession, and setting up offensive plays. This means passing the ball to his teammates to start the plays, and, when possible, scoring on his own. The point guard usually gets the ball when it's passed in-bounds at the beginning of an offensive possession. Generally, he'll bring the ball up court to the defense's key, then stay around the perimeter, near the three-point line to set up plays.


There are exceptions to this, of course. For instance, if the defense is running a heavy full-court press (that is, they're guarding every offensive player even before they cross the half court line), the point guard may not have the liberty of being able to bring the ball up court all by himself. In this case, he may need to pass it off to a teammate fairly quickly.;
, As the point guard moves the ball up the court, he'll usually keep dribbling it until a play begins. As he gets closer to the net, he'll come under heavier and heavier pressure from the defense. Usually, by the time he gets to the three-point line, he'll have one man guarding him and will be unable to keep going forward without opening himself up to heavy defensive pressure. As the point guard nears the hoop, he must be careful not to give the defense any chances to steal the ball.


Note that it's generally considered a bad idea for the point guard to stop dribbling the ball before he needs to (for instance, at the very start of a play). If the point guard stops dribbling, he can't move again without getting a penalty called on him, which means the defense only needs to guard against him passing or shooting, giving them a much easier job.

, One of the point guard's most important duties is to make passes to teammates who have a good chance of scoring. In general, if the point guard sees a teammate near the hoop or around the perimeter of the key who isn't being well-defended, he should pass to him so that he'll have an unobstructed shot. A good point guard should have lots of assists at the end of most of his games — these are signs that he's been passing the ball to the right people to rack up his team's score. But you should never force passes.

, While it's important for the point guard to set other players up to score points, he shouldn't be any scoring slouch himself. If the point guard sees that all of his teammates are tied up with defenders but there's an opening for him to score, he'll want to be able to attack the hoop by going for a layup or shooting a jump shot. If the defense sees that he can't do these things very well, they may leave him relatively unguarded and concentrate on the other players, making it harder for the team as a whole to score.


A point guard with an excellent three-point shot or jump shot is especially valuable. With this ability, he has the potential to score from virtually anywhere around the basket, which means that the defense will almost always have to use a man to guard him. This makes it easier for the other people on the point guard's team to score!

, Whether or not your team's shot makes it into the basket, the point guard should be ready to get on defense as soon as the ball's in the air. Unless the point guard has seen an opening and has driven to the hoop for a layup, he'll probably be positioned somewhere at the top of the key or along the three point line. This gives him a crucial advantage on defense — because he's usually the furthest from the hoop, he's also usually one of the best-positioned players to set up an early defense should the ball change hands.


Beware the fast break — if you see a defender blow past you on the way to the other basket as soon as the ball goes in or his team gets the rebound, follow him! You may be the only player on your time who isn't tied up near the basket, so you're the only one who can keep the other team from scoring easy points.

, Though a point guard may sometimes make plays right up to the hoop, often, his ""default"" position will be at the ""top"" of the action — usually at or near the three point line in front of the basket. This gives him a good view of both teams' players, which is important for spotting scoring openings and setting up plays. It also gives the point guard the easiest, most direct path to the hoop if the defense fails to guard him.


Of course, the point guard shouldn't feel limited to this zone, either. If an offensive play demands it, the point guard should feel versatile playing in any area of the court, including under the hoop.

, As mentioned in the intro, the point guard usually acts as sort of a ""leader"" for the offense. Since he usually starts off with the ball and stays at the perimeter of the action, he's in a better position than anyone else to tell his teammates what to do to score. It's very common for a point guard to use verbal commands, hand signals, and ""code words"" to give his teammates directions. For instance, on a given play, he might call out the name of a play that the team has practiced before or direct a teammate to make a break for the hoop with eye contact and a quick motion of his head.


The point guard's commands should always serve to create scoring opportunities for his teammates. If he's not looking for an open teammate to pass the ball to, he's trying to get his teammates to make an opening so that either or someone else can score.
To get an idea of the sort of directions a good point guard gives, watch one in action. The next time you watch a basketball game, keep an eye on the point guard. You should see him constantly surveying the court, barking out orders, and giving nonverbal cues to his teammates. For instance, it's very common for a point guard to ask for a screen by making eye contact with one of his teammates and gesturing toward the defender in front of him.

, When a point guard sees a teammate with an opportunity to score, he wants to get the ball into his teammate's hands as quickly as possible so that the teammate can score before his opportunity passes. For this reason, point guards need to keep their passing as efficient as possible. Point guards should use fast, forceful passes to get the ball to their teammates. They shouldn't use passing motions that require a wind-up motion — this gives the defenders a hint that a pass is on the way.


At the highest levels of basketball, point guards sometimes use no-look passes, behind the back passes, and complicated fake-out moves to great effect. However, unless you're experienced with these sorts of moves, don't count on them during a game. Never attempt a flashy or showy pass when a simple chess pass will work just as well.
Be wary of passing the ball into (or through) a crowd, even if the person you intend the ball to go to is open. The more defenders your pass sends the ball near, the bigger chance it'll be intercepted.

, As mentioned above, it's a big bonus to the offense if the point guard is a credible scoring threat. If the defense believes you have the ability to score, they'll guard you, freeing up your other teammates. The best way to be a scoring threat to the defense is to score points when you can. If the defense leaves you unguarded, punish them for it.


For instance, let's say you pass the ball to a teammate, but they're quickly covered and can't shoot. If the defender who was guarding you follows the ball, you'll want to get the ball back from your teammate right away so that you can shoot — odds are that your teammate can pass you the ball faster than your defender can run back to you. Note, however, that this requires both you and your teammate to be aware of what the defense is doing.
If you've got a defender in front of you when you're trying to shoot, one way to open up a clear shot is to use a pump fake. Basically, you want to try to start your normal shooting motion, then suddenly stop it. Plant your feet, bend your knees, grab the ball with both hands, and bring it up to your nose as if you're about to shoot. If done well, your defender may jump to block the shot, giving you the opportunity to quickly blow around him or time your shot so that you make it just as he's hitting the ground.

, Because the point guard has the ball for much of the time that it's in his team's possession, he can essentially control how ""fast"" the game moves. If he takes his time getting the ball up the court and taking a shot, he's said to be ""slowing the game down,"" whereas if he immediately sprints up the court or passes to an open teammate for the shot, he's said to be ""speeding the game up."" Both can be smart choices depending on the circumstances of the game. Below are just a few examples of situations that might lead you to speed up or slow down play:Your team is in the lead after a few successful fast breaks, but your teammates are looking tired. In this case, slow the game down to give them a chance to recuperate during your possession — you'll probably be better off in the long run even if you don't score points immediately.
Your opponents are visibly tired. In this case, look for an opening for a fast break to speed the game up and score some easy points — the defense doesn't get to decide the tempo of the game, so take advantage of their fatigue!
You’ve started a fast break, but your opponents have gotten up the court before you and are guarding the basket. In this case, don’t drive into a crowd of defenders — instead, stay at the perimeter and wait for your teammates to catch up.

, Just like on offense, the point guard usually stays at the perimeter of the key or near the three point line on defense. This positions him well to guard the opposing team's point guard, essentially playing the reverse of the role that he played on offense. This allows you to put the pressure on the opponent's point guard that's needed to prevent him from simply shooting or driving to the hoop as soon as he get up court.


As on offense, however, there are plenty of cases in which you'll need to move from this default position depending on what the offense does. For instance, if the point guard passes the ball to a teammate and then moves toward the hoop, you'll want to stay on him, denying him an easy path to the basket. In this case, there's a chance that he's looking to get the ball back under the hoop for an easy lay up, so stay between him and the hoop.

, It's a common saying in basketball that defense is 90% heart, 10% skill — in other words, the strategy is simpler, but your physicality is more important. To be the most effective defensive player you can be, be conscious of the way you're using your body to guard your opponent. Below are some general defensive tips for point guards:


Stay low. Keeping your shoulders low and your hips back while you guard an opponent makes it easier for you to react to his motions — especially if he tries to blow around you.
Keep your hands ready. Most defensive players keep at least one hand up when their opponent is within shooting range to block his shots. Many also like to keep one hand low to block passes and make steal attempts.
Stay about an arm's length from your opponent. If you're too far away, your opponent may be able to get a shot off before you block him, but if you're too close, he'll have an easy time blowing around you.
Have quick footwork. Use choppy, short steps like a lineman in football. The quicker your steps are, the quicker you'll be able to react to an opponent's change in direction.

, Since you're guarding the opponent's point guard, you'll need to be on the lookout for lots of passes. It's almost impossible to block every pass, and if you try to, your opponent will quickly learn to fake you out and go to the hoop. Instead, try to be aware of where the other offensive players are so that, when you see a pass coming, you can get in front of your opponent's pass right as he's making it for an interception attempt. The balance between pass-blocking and guarding the point guard is a tricky one, so point guard who are good on defense are highly prized.


Because he's facing away from the hoop, it's usually harder for a defensive point guard to have a good idea of what's happening on the court than an offensive one. You may take quick looks behind you and to your sides to get a sense for the offense's positioning, but don't take your eyes off of your man for too long or he'll be wide open for a shot.

, As noted above, sometimes, the point guard is the only defender who's in position to defend against an opposing team's fast break. In this case, try to stay between the ball carrier and the hoop. Don't let him get ahead of you or he'll have an easy time scoring. Be ready to follow him all the way to the basket — most fast breaks will end with a layup attempt.


Fast breaks are extra-hard to defend against if two offensive players are coming at you at once. In this case, you'll want to avoid committing too heavily to either player. If you do, he'll pass it to the other one and you won't have time to react before he scores. Try to stay ahead of both players and between them and the basket. Balancing your attention between both players slows them down and gives the rest of your team time to catch up. If one player stops dribbling before he's very close to the hoop, be ready to box out the other player and go for the rebound. If either player has an easy shot near the hoop, be ready to block it.

, Compared to the other players, the point guard usually has a special relationship with his coach. The point guard is responsible for running the coach's offensive plays on the field but also must have the knowledge of the coach's overarching game plan necessary to call plays on the fly when needed. For these reasons, a point guard will need to understand the coach's offensive playbook better than anyone else on the team (and will need to be able to execute the coach's instructions as he gives them during the game).


In addition, since he's usually in control of the ball at the start of the play, the point guard is tasked with performing certain special duties like calling a time out. Knowing when to do these things requires him to be aware of both his coach's plan and the circumstances of the game (especially late in the game when time outs and other stalling tactics are common).

, A point guard who can't communicate with his teammates on the court can be a major liability to his team. Point guards should be able to use their voice and body to direct their teammates to set up scoring opportunities, execute plays, and so on. A big part of developing these communication skills is putting in lots of practice as a team so that every member knows what sorts of signals to expect and how each member communicates as a player.


The point guard may want to talk to his teammates and agree on a system of signals, code words and so on to keep his team's strategy secret on the court. For instance, if the point guard raises a fist when he's at the top of the key, this can be a signal for the small forward to cut back the three point line and get ready for a pass.

, Because of your unique position, your other teammates (especially inexperienced ones) may look to you to ""set the tone"" for your games and practices. A good point guard takes the game seriously, puts in hard work at practice, listens to his coach, and seeks to improve his game outside of practice. Just as importantly, he also encourages his teammates to do the same. By earning the respect of his teammates through work and dedication, the point guard can improve the team's communication and help develop valuable on-the-court camaraderie.

, Professional basketball has no shortage of great point guards — some are all-time league legends, while some are active players today. Watching these point guards dominate the court can be inspiring, humbling, and educational for amateur point guards looking to up their game. Here are just a few NBA point guards who are considered to be some of the best to ever play the position:Isiah Thomas
Stephen Curry
Gary Payton
Magic Johnson
Jason Kidd
John Stockton
James Harden
Russell Westbrook
Dwayne Wade

If you want to throw a spiral, get the right kind of ball:









Size 9 is the official size for pro, college, and all players ages 14+
Size 8 should be used for players ages 12-14
Sizes 6 and 7 should be used for pee-wee football and young children;
, If you want to throw a spiral, the best way to hold the football is to place the ring and pinkie finger of your throwing hand in between the laces, and your thumb underneath them, on the other side of the ball. The thumb should be just underneath the white ring on the football, which you can use as a guide.









Some quarterbacks place the middle finger along the laces as well. It depends on how large your hand is and what feels most comfortable for you.

, Your index finger should be over a seam, close to or on the tip of the football, with your thumb and index finger making a right angle with each other.









You'll need to experiment some to see what feels the most comfortable for you and your hand strength in terms of your index finger placement. Depending on how big your hands are, your finger will be closer to your other fingers, or the tip., For the ball to spiral effectively, you'll need to spin it with your hand, which becomes very difficult if you're not gripping the ball with your fingertips. Practice grabbing the ball with the pads of your fingertips, your knuckles arched slightly off the surface of the ball.









Don't ""palm"" the football. Try to keep space between the center of the palm and the ball, or you'll increase the chances of a wobbly throw.
Keep your hold firm enough to rotate your hand without the ball slipping out, but not so firm your fingers start to get tired.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Flex your knees slightly, and position your body so you're standing sideways. So, if you’re right-handed, you should be facing to the right with your left foot forward.









Distribute your weight so that it's back on hind leg. Good passes need to be stepped into, so distributing your weight back will allow you to put more power into your throws as you wind up.
The foot opposite your throwing arm should be forward, aimed at your target in the direction that you're throwing.
It's also good to keep your feet moving, ""buzzing"" them to stay on your toes. Never stand flat-footed when you're throwing the football.

, As you prepare to throw and find your target, keep your upper arm perpendicular with your body and your forearm at a right angle. Use your other hand to keep the ball steady, maintaining a solid grip on the football.









Keep your elbow at a 90 degree angle at all times as you cock the ball back to throw it. Rotate your throwing arm at the shoulder, pushing it straight back, but keeping the football and your hand pointing up.
Throwing the football involves your whole body, using it in one fluid motion to twist yourself into the throw. Step forward with your front foot, pushing your non-throwing hand out in front of your for balance.

, Think of it like the tomahawk chop cheer. When you throw a football correctly, it should feel as though you are pushing the ball straight-ahead, and your palm should face down as you finish the throw. Release the ball at the highest point in the throw before you arm starts rotating down. If you release it too high, the throw will wobble, and if you release it too late, it'll end up on the ground.









When you release the ball, spin it with your fingers to initiate the spiral. As you step into the throw, pitch your throwing hand forward, spinning the ball as you release it. Basically, you want to use your fingers to roll the ball out of your hand. Make sure that your hand and arm extend so that your index finger is the last one on the ball.
Some football players like Philip Rivers and Tim Tebow use more a side-arm style of throwing the ball to throw spirals effectively, while other quarterbacks like Joe Montana have a more vertical throwing motion. Most quarterbacks fall somewhere in between.

, If you stop your throwing motion as soon as you let go of the ball, it will wobble. This is one of the most common causes of a wobbly toss, so it's important to follow through every time you throw, even on short throws. Rotate your throwing thumb toward the opposite thigh. Make sure the inside of the index finger is the last part of your body that touches the football.








, It's true, there are a lot of components to throwing a football correctly, and a lot of it will only make sense with practice. The most important part of the spiral action is completing all the mechanics of the throw as smoothly as possible, so practice until you can do it in your sleep.








, If you're trying to launch hail Marys, it's likely that most of them will end up looking like wobblers. To get the mechanics of the spiral down, it's a good idea to practice throwing tight and accurate short passes, no more than 10 or 15 yards when you're first starting out. As you built strength and comfort at that distance, you can start throwing spirals at a farther distance.








, Tight muscles result in wobbly tosses and pulled muscles. Before you throw a football, you need to be stretched out. Take 10-15 minutes before you toss the football around to make sure you're stretched out properly, and you'll notice a difference in the quality of your spirals as well as the sore muscles you won't have the next day. Try the following stretches:









Stretch your back
Stretch your shoulders
Stretch your upper back
Stretch your chest

, The right mechanics are the most important part of throwing spirals, but having the strength to do it is also important, especially when you start throwing at longer distances. If you want to strengthen your upper body, start working out your biceps, triceps, and pectoral muscles, as well as the muscles in your forearms.








, Hand and wrist strength is likewise a very important part of your throwing motion. As much time as you devote to throwing the football and practicing your mechanics should be spent in the gym, working out your arms and hands, if you want to throw spirals reliably and accurately.

Develop your running first.,
Improve your ball handling.,
Bulk up.,
Work on your balance.,
Work with your offensive line and quarterback.,
Never switch off when your team is on defense.,
Have good vision.",How to Be a Better Running Back," Straight line speed, acceleration, and lateral agility all are crucial to dodge defenders and get to the end zone, or even just make it to the sidelines and stop the clock. It doesn't matter how big or small you are, if you can't get away from defenders, you'll never reach where your goal.;
, Practice accepting the ball cleanly, gripping it securely and tucking the ball away as surely and quickly as possible. Hold the ball as close to your body as possible and protect it as much as possible. This will give defenders as little chance to knock the ball away as possible. And if you have to catch the ball on a screen pass or if you have to return a punt, learn to catch the ball with both hands.

, It doesn't matter how little you are, even if you are the fastest man on turf, you will still get tackled. You will get gang-tackled by two or three people trying to bring you down. Protecting the ball is more important, but being able to take the hits, lay a strong stiff-arm and shed tackles is just as important. You can also block people better. Bulk up to show a little intimidation.

, It doesn't matter if you are trying to keep your knees from hitting the ground from the first tackle, or if you are trying to stay in bounds, you can avoid some injuries, too.

, You have to read the defense as well as your quarterback. Sometimes, you may even have to break up a supposed outside run and you must run inside (or vice versa).

, The opposing running backs may have better solutions to your mistakes. Imagine what you would do if you were that other back. Situations can't be taught thoroughly. You have to prepare yourself for every eventuality.

, In order to be a good running back you must have good vision, which means you must be able to read your blocks and know which gap you must attack when running the ball, the gap your supposed to run to is not always open so you must be able to redirect and cut back in order to make a play.

Practice, practice, practice.",How to Throw a Football1," Focus on stretching your whole body - not just your arms. Football throwing is a complex physio-mechanical process that uses multiple muscle groups, including your core, legs, and shoulders.When you throw your ring finger and pinkie finger on the middle laces.Your middle finger next to the top lace.Pay special attention to these areas as these muscles will stabilize your body and add power to your throw.;
, The most common way to hold the football is with your ring and little fingers crossing the laces and your thumb underneath. Your index finger should be over a seam, and your thumb and index fingers should make an ""L"" shape.


Many quarterbacks prefer variations on the common grip on the ball, as described above. For instance, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning lays his middle finger across the laces in addition to his ring and little fingers.Experiment to see which position is most comfortable for you.
Don't ""palm"" the football. Hold it lightly with your fingertips. Some palm contact is OK, but try to keep space between the center of the palm and the ball.
Don't grip the ball too tightly. Keep your hold firm but loose - you'll be able to adjust your grip more easily.


, Face 90 degrees away from your target. If you throw with your right hand, turn to the right, and vice versa if you throw with your left hand. Turn your pivot foot (opposite your throwing arm) so that it's pointing toward your target. Keep your eyes on the target.

, Before you throw the ball, keep it up near your ear, stabilizing it with your non-throwing hand. This allows you to be ready to throw the ball quickly at any time, minimizing the risk of telegraphing your pass to a defender.

, Release your non-throwing hand from the ball. Wind your throwing arm back, stopping just behind your ear.

, Quickly swing your throwing arm forward in a circular arc. Release the ball mid-way through the circle. Your empty hand should then head toward your non-dominant hip, palm facing away from you. Practice this motion a few times before you let go of the ball.


Use the rest of your body to build momentum for your throw. The hips, legs and shoulders can add great power to a pass.Step forward with your non-dominant (or pivot) foot, and move your non-dominant elbow down toward your back. Rotate your hips and shoulders in the direction of the pass.


, As the football leaves your hand, it should roll off of your fingertips. Your index finger will be the last part of your body touching the ball. This provides the spin that creates the desired ""spiral"" effect.


A proper throw will feel like it's only utilizing the thumb, index, and middle finger. The other two fingers on your hand stabilize the ball as it's being flung. They are not generally used to impart spin on the ball.
To impart more spin on the pass, you may snap your wrist forward as you follow through to the hip.

, Persistent, dedicated practice will improve your accuracy and distance. While practicing, experiment with small adjustments in your stance and grip. Once you have mastered the basics, these small changes allow you to fine-tune your technique to maximize comfort and results.

This increases the eye part of hand eye coordination. Every time you take your eyes off the ball you increase your chances of dropping it or the other team getting it. If you aren't focused on the ball when it hits you in the hands, catching it becomes pure luck.






;
, This makes sure that if the ball isn't thrown directly at your hands, you have more chance of catching it. Extend your arms right before the ball reaches you. Never leave your hands flat.








, You want to cup your hand so there is a slight space between them, so one cupped hand circles the right side of the ball, whilst the other one encompasses the left.









If the ball is below the waist, your palms should still face out, but put your pinkies together. If you are running and the ball is thrown high, similarly try to put your pinkies together.

, Keep your eyes on the ball the whole time. You should feel a slight pressure and you might even let out a small 'oomph' depending on how well your counterpart throws the ball. This is the hand part of hand eye coordination. If you try to run before you've caught the ball, chances are you'll drop it.









If the pass is below the waist, let the ball slide through the inside of your palms about halfway and then clamp down on it.

, After you have clamped down on the ball, tuck it under your arm on the opposite side of any defenders. If you want, you can also clutch the football with both hands right near your belly button if you don't need the other hand to keep your balance or stiff-arm a defender.








, Make sure that you see in your mind catching the pass. Under no circumstances think ""I'm not going to catch this football"" or ""I hope the defender doesn't tackle me."" Think positively and visualize a successful catch from start to finish.








,, In a game, when success is on the line, you should be trying to catch the ball two-handed every single time. Sometimes, however, you won't be able to — maybe the cornerback's arm will be grabbing yours, or maybe the ball will be overthrown. Whatever the situation, think two hands first, one hand second.

, If you can, take your dominant hand, open your palm completely, and begin to follow the movement of the ball with your hand. With just enough hand-eye-coordination, you can begin to do with just by looking at the ball, not looking at your hand at all.

, Right before the ball flies into your hand, move your hand back slightly. This will cushion the impact. By doing this, you're effectively making the ball travel slower as it hits your hand because your hand is traveling backwards as well.


Think about it: If you don't move your hand back at impact, the ball is going to bounce off your hand like a tennis ball off of a brick wall. If you do move your hand back, the ball will nestle into your hand like a head onto a pillow. Or at least that's the hope!

, Catching the ball only with your palm will make the tucking much harder when you're trying to control the catch. If you catch the ball with both your strong fingers and your palm, it'll be much easier to hold onto the ball as you bring it away from your body towards it.

, Try to use your body as a stabilizer by quickly tucking the ball against it.


Practice makes perfect, especially with one-handed catches. Be sure to practice one-handed catches with a friend by throwing each other the ball. Start off slow and gradually throw the ball faster. It'll be easier to catch slower passes than quicker ones. Once you've mastered the soft-toss, practice with quicker throws. Enjoy!

If you stop moving, you become an easier target. You can do a quick juke or something, but don't let it slow you down.;
, If you know where the defenders are coming from, they'll be much easier to dodge. Always know where the defense is, and you have a better chance of keeping them off of you.

, Lower your shoulder into him, protect that ball, and let him know you are not going down without a fight. Keep your legs moving regardless, even after you hit him. Too many times running backs and receivers get clocked because they stop moving.

Each team uses the end zone in front of them to score while trying to prevent the opposing team from reaching the end zone behind them. Each end zone has a Y-shaped structure called the field goal which is positioned on the end line. The field goals are used to score points with special kicks.


The end zone that a team is defending is usually referred to as “their” end zone. Thus, a team with 70 yards (64.0 m) to go before it can score a touchdown is 30 yards (27.4 m) from its end zone.
Teams trade possession of the ball according to strict rules. Whichever team is in possession of the ball is known as the “offense;” the other team is called the “defense.”;
, Football is divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each, with a break between the second and third periods called “halftime” that is normally 12 minutes long. While the clock is active, the game is divided into even shorter segments called “plays"" or ""downs.""


A play begins when the ball is moved from the ground into the hands of the players, and ends when either the ball hits the ground, or the person holding the ball is tackled and his knee or elbow touches the ground. When a play is over, an official called a referee, places the ball on the yard marker which corresponds to his or her judgment of the place where the forward progress of the player with the ball was stopped. Each team has 4 downs and within those downs, they have to make ten yards from the line of scrimmage (the starting point). If the team fails to do so within the 4 downs, the offensive team has to hand over the ball to the opposing team. If the offense succeeds in taking the ball 10 yards in the 4 downs they get another 4 downs to move the ball 10 yards. The teams have 30 seconds to get into formation and begin the next play.
Play time can stop for a few different reasons: If a player runs out of bounds, a penalty is called, a flag is thrown, or a pass is thrown but not caught by anybody (an incomplete pass), the clock will stop while referees sort everything out.
Penalties are indicated by referees, who throw yellow flags onto the field when they see a violation. This lets everyone on the field know that a penalty has been called. Penalties normally result in the offending team losing between 5 - 15 yards of field position. There are many penalties, but some of the most common are “offside” (someone was on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage when the ball was snapped), “holding” (a player grabbed another player with his hands, and either player doesn't have the ball, instead of blocking him properly), ""false start"" (When a player moves before the ball is snapped), ""Unsportsmanlike conduct"" (When a player does something that doesn't show good sportsmanship, and “clipping” (someone contacted an opposing player other than the ball carrier from behind and below the waist).

, American football is made up of two basic structural elements that guide play. These are the kickoff and the downs system.



The opening kickoff - At the very beginning of the game, the head referee flips a coin and the home team captain calls out which side of the coin will be face up. If correct, that captain may choose to kick off or to receive the opening kickoff or allow the visiting team captain to make that choice. Once the kicking and receiving teams are decided, the team captain who lost the coin toss gets to decide which goal his or her team will defend during the first half. This initial play is called the kickoff, and typically involves a long kick down field from one team to the other, with the team that kicked the ball rushing towards the team receiving the ball in order to prevent them from running the ball a long ways back towards the kicking team's end zone. After halftime, there is a second kickoff by whichever team did not perform the opening kickoff. Throughout the second half, the end zones each team defends is the one opposite the end zone that team defended in the first half.

Downs - The word “down” is synonymous with the word “chance” or ""plays"" in American football. The offense is allowed four downs to move the ball at least 10 yards (9.1 m) towards the end zone. Each play ends in a new down. If the goal of 10 yards (9.1 m) from the first down is achieved before the fourth down is over, the count resets to the first down, commonly noted as “1st and 10” to indicate that the standard 10 yards (9.1 m) are once again required to reset to the first down. Otherwise, the downs count from one to four. If four downs pass without resetting to the first down, control of the ball passes to the other team.

This means that a team that moves the ball 10 or more yards on each play will never be on the second down. Every time the ball is moved 10 yards (9.1 m) or more in the proper direction, the next play is a first down with 10 yards (9.1 m) to go.
The distance required to reset to the first down is cumulative, so running 4 yards (3.7 m) on the first down, 3 yards (2.7 m) on the second, and 3 yards (2.7 m) on the third is enough for the next play to be a first down again.
If a play ends with the ball behind the line of scrimmage, the difference in yards is added to the total number of yards required for a first down. For example, if the quarterback is tackled 7 yards (6.4 m) behind the line with the ball in his hands, the next play will be noted as “2nd and 17,” meaning that 17 yards (15.5 m) must be covered in the next three plays to reset to a first down.
Instead of playing the fourth down, the offense can choose to punt the ball, which is a long kick that transfers control of the ball to the other team, but is likely to force them to start farther up the field than they would otherwise have been.



, Each team is allowed to have eleven players on the field at once. Different team members hold different positions and have different duties on the field. Most competitive teams are actually composed of three separate teams of players, each of which is rotated onto the field to perform one type of task.


The offensive team includes the following players:

The quarterback, who throws a pass to a running back, fullback, wide receiver, or tight end, or hands the ball to a runner.
The offensive line, composed of the center, two guards, and two tackles, who collectively defend the other players from the defense while the ball is being handed off or passed. The center is directly in front of the quarterback and ""snaps"" (tosses the ball backwards) the ball to him. The guards are on either of the center's shoulders, and the tackles line up on the guard's shoulders
Wide receivers, who run over the line of scrimmage and catch the ball if a pass is being thrown.
The running back, who takes the ball from the quarterback and runs it towards the end zone.
Tight ends, who help defend the outside edges of the line and can also catch the ball in case of a pass.


The defensive team comprises the following players:

Linebackers, who defend against passing plays and also rush through the line and blitz the quarterback.
The defensive line, who keep the pressure on the offensive line. They can also blitz the quarterback.
Cornerbacks and safeties, who defend players trying to receive a pass or trying to run the ball down the field past the defensive line. They can also blitz the quarterback.


The third team is the special team used any time the ball will be kicked. Their job is to allow the person kicking the ball to make a clean kick without being harassed by the other team.

, The goal of the game is to score more points than the opposing team. In the case of a tie, an additional 15 minute overtime period is usually played. Scoring is as follows:


A touchdown is when the football is successfully carried into the proper end zone by a player (or caught by a player standing in the proper end zone), is worth 6 points.
An extra point, wherein a player kicks the football between the goal posts after his team has scored a touchdown, is worth 1 point. When the touchdown play is followed by a passing or running play into the end zone instead of a kick, the play is called a two point conversion, and is worth 2 points.
A field goal, is when or where a player kicks the football between the goal posts without having scored a touchdown on the previous play, is worth 3 points. Field goals are commonly seen as last-ditch tactics at the end of close games.
A safety, wherein a player is so far down the field that he is in his own end zone and is subsequently tackled while holding the ball, is worth 2 points.

, Generally the most common type of play seen in football is the running play. Running plays tend to yield less yardage per play than passing plays but are much less likely to accidentally transfer control of the ball to the other team. They have the added advantage of getting the football out of the quarterback's hands quickly before an aggressive defense can reach his position and cost the team extra yards. If the ball is dropped during a running play, it is called a fumble. A fumbled ball can be picked up by either the other team, or the team that fumbled it to gain or regain control of it.


The quarterback normally hands the ball off to a teammate (typically a running back) to execute a running play, but he can also choose to run the ball himself. Being able to think quickly and assess the situation as it changes is a vital skill for a quarterback to help him decide when to run the ball on his own.
Running plays have the benefit of being difficult to see in detail from behind the defensive line. Very often, the offense will try to trick the defense by seeming to hand the ball off to two or even three different runners. When the ruse works, the one runner who actually has the ball can sometimes break past the defense before they know what has happened and run all the way down the field for an easy touchdown.

, Slightly less common than the running play, the passing play is a great way to make up lost yards quickly... if the pass is completed. Short passing plays are often used in combination with running plays as well, to keep the defense on its toes. The great advantage of a passing play is its ability to completely circumvent a tough ground defense. Incomplete passes (wherein nobody catches the ball after it is thrown) stop the clock and end the play.


The quarterback usually needs more time to throw a pass than is required for a running play, so the offensive line must be exceptionally unyielding while the quarterback scans the field for an open receiver in order to prevent him from being sacked (tackled behind the line of scrimmage while still holding the ball). Once an opening is spotted, the quarterback has to estimate how far to throw the ball so that the receiver will be able to catch it while in motion.
If a pass is caught by the defense, it is called an interception. A fumble is when the ball comes loose from the offenses hands and the defense gains control of the ball (and becomes the offense). Just as importantly, the play is not over once the ball has been intercepted. The defending player who made the interception can (and often does) turn right around and run the ball back down the field for an exciting touchdown.

, Your offensive team should plan to use a mixture of both running and passing plays in order to keep the defense guessing. Practice a few different formations with your team and get good at running them.


The quarterback especially should practice throwing the ball accurately, as well as learning to make convincing fake handoffs to the running backs.
As a rule of thumb, it's safer to start out with a couple of running plays until your team gets a feel for how the defense responds. A defensive team that's great at intercepting the ball might not have much going for it on the ground, or vice versa.
Adjust your mix accordingly. If you're playing defense, watch player positions carefully and try to anticipate whether the play will be a running play, a short pass, or a long pass so that you can defend against it as effectively as possible. And remember, nothing stops a play of any kind as quickly as sacking the quarterback, so if you see an opening, go for it.

, By far the best way to get better at playing football is to practice regularly. The game uses a special skill set that is not seen very many other places in life, so consistent work is required to improve the way you play.


Practice with your team if at all possible. Practice holding the ball, catching the ball, and running with it; practice watching the other players so that you can change what you are doing based on what is happening elsewhere on the field.
Strength and endurance training is very important, too.
Don't forget to practice strategy and special plays, like field goals, together so that you can go out onto the field and work as an intelligent whole when game day arrives.

, This guide only lists the most basic elements of play. Team formations and strategies go far beyond the information presented here. Read up on some of them and think about how your team can use them to gain an advantage on the field.

, The offense's backbone. The quarterback is the player that receives the start of play snap. The player often gets to chose whether he should hand it off to one of the running backs, run the play himself, or pass it to one of his teammates.

, The Running back is in charge of running the football or helping to block for the quarterback during a pass play . A running back must have quick feet and fast legs to be able to dodge any defenders.

Know when to attempt a Hail Mary.,
Assume the passing stance.,
Right before you throw the ball, step backwards.,
Lean backwards slightly as you begin to throw the ball.,
Throw the ball in a high, fast arc over your head.",How to Throw a Football2," Hail Mary passes are high-risk and long-range. They originally gained their name from Catholic university football teams that would say a prayer before especially desperate plays. Hail Mary passes are typically only thrown when the offensive team needs to gain substantial yards (usually with little play time remaining) and is unable to attempt a conventional play. Consider throwing a Hail Mary in situations like the following:


You possess the ball for the last play of the half and are a long way from the end zone.
You have to complete a long fourth-down play and punting isn't advisable (for instance, if the game will end during the next possession and you are behind.)
You possess the ball for the last play of the game and can potentially prevent the game going into overtime by scoring.
Caution: Long passes are risky - it's difficult for even the best quarterbacks to throw accurately at extremely long distances, and because these passes typically travel in a higher arc, they are easier for the defense to intercept. Also, because the receivers require more time to get into position for the pass, the quarterback is open to a sack for more time. For these reasons, use caution when throwing Hail Mary Passes.

, Grip the back of the football with your index finger, middle finger and thumb, laying whichever fingers are comfortable (including your ring finger and pinky) over the ball's laces. Keep a slight bend in your knees. Face ninety degrees away from your target with your throwing hand away from him and your forward foot pointed forward.


Because you will need to wait longer than usual before throwing the pass, drop back especially far after receiving the snap - you'll be more able to avoid rushers. If you are tackled while throwing, see Method Four below.

, Keep the ball in the ""ready to throw"" position near your ear. By stepping back, you are positioning yourself to push forward as you throw, giving your throw greater momentum.

, Cock your arm backward behind your head in a wind-up motion. Bend your knees slightly as you push off of the ground with your back foot and begin to step forward.

, Lean forward as you throw the ball. Rotate your hips and shoulders through the throw as you continue to step forward. By stepping forward, rotating, and leaning into the pass, you impart additional momentum on the ball, sending it farther down the field.


Allow the ball to roll off your fingers as in Method One above. Follow through the motion by continuing to step forward until you naturally slow down. Don't lose focus now - if your Hail Mary is intercepted, you may need to try to tackle the ball carrier!
For best results, try to arc the ball high enough that it reaches your receiver's hands while passing over his defender's head. To arc the ball higher, release it a split-second earlier in your throw.

Know when to attempt a bullet pass.,
Assume the passing stance.,
Cock your arm back to the side of your head.,
Step forward hard as you begin to throw.,
Snap your arm forward in a tight, controlled arc.,
Follow through with your shoulders and hips as normal.",How to Throw a Football3," Bullet passes are short-range, high-speed passes. The goal when throwing a bullet is to make the ball travel as fast and in as flat of an arc as possible. Bullets are thrown during quick, short-range plays - because they are fast, they are harder to intercept, so they are especially useful when the ball needs to be thrown near a defender to reach a receiver. Bullet passes can be useful for:


Gaining several yards to convert a first down.
Scoring a touchdown on a goal line play.
Quickly getting the ball to a fast, maneuverable runner.

, Grip the back of the football comfortably over the ball's laces. Face ninety degrees away from your receiver (with throwing hand away from him). Stay light on your feet, with your forward foot pointing forward.


Don't drop back as far as you would for a Hail Mary pass. Your goal is to execute the pass as quickly as possible - look for your receiver immediately.

, Don't cock your arm behind your head, as you would for a Hail Mary - throwing the ball over your head will send it too high. Stay light on your feet, with your knees slightly bent.

, Stepping forward hard is a good, quick way to put additional momentum on the throw, since you won't usually have time or space to perform the backward-then-forward footwork like you would with a Hail Mary.

, Throwing a bullet pass should feel like throwing a punch - it's a short, powerful motion done all at once. Put lots of power into the throw to make the ball fly as quickly as possible. Throw the ball in as flat of an arc as possible - release it a split-second later than you normally would for a flatter arc.

, Because the motions involved with a bullet pass are tighter and quicker than those of other passes, you may not need to rotate your body as far as you would for a normal pass. Allow the ball to roll off of your fingers for a spiral.

Know your options.,
Know your field position.,
If you're about to be tackled, act sooner rather than later.,
Try to take a tackle in the lower body.,
Concentrate on your receiver as you're tackled, throwing to him only if he is open.,
Use as much of your body as you can to generate momentum.,
Throw over defenders' heads.",How to Throw a Football4," The best option of all, of course, is to avoid situations where you have to make a split-second decision or be sacked. Unfortunately, every quarterback finds himself in this situation eventually. If a sack is imminent, throwing the ball is only one of your options. Based on the circumstances on the field, you may also choose to do one of the following:


Run the ball. If your linemen have made an opening for you, you may want to dodge any rushers and run forward for a possible gain of several yards. If there's no openings, you should run up the side of the field. In both situations, you may still be tackled for a loss of yards, but you still avoid an especially damaging sack.
Execute a lateral. If there is an open and attentive offensive player (usually a running back), you can toss the ball to him as long as he is behind or to the side of you. This is called a ""lateral."" If an attempted lateral goes forward, it is usually illegal and will receive a penalty.

, Intentionally throwing the ball away to avoid a sack can be illegal based on where you are on the field. In the NFL, throwing the ball away while you are within the ""pocket"" formed by your offensive tackles results in an Intentional Grounding penalty. However, if you are outside the pocket, you may throw the ball away.


An intentional grounding penalty results in a loss of 10 yards (9.1 m) - worse than many sacks. Because of this, it may be better to take a small loss of yards if you are in the pocket.

, In the NFL, a pass begins when the passer begins to bring his hand forward. Thus, the quicker you initiate the pass, the more likely you are to have an incomplete pass called (which will result in no lost yards.)

, It's difficult to maneuver in the instant before being tackled, but, if possible, try to ensure the tackler grabs your lower body. If he wraps your arms up, you won't be able to throw and may even risk a fumble.


Keep your arms free, but if you can't throw before you're tackled, tuck the ball in as you fall. This way, you're less likely to lose control of it and fumble.

, If you're feeling lucky and you can't see any receivers as you're being tackled, you can try passing the ball so that it is blocked by part of a defender's body but is not caught. This is risky, but will result in an incomplete pass.

, This will vary based on which parts of your body the tackler has a hold on. If you have a free leg, step into the pass. If your upper body is free, roll your shoulders through the pass.

, The only outcome worse than a sack is an interception, so make sure the pass is out of reach of any defenders between you and the receiver. This may require throwing over the body of your tackler if you are being tackled from the front.

Stay behind and let your teammates get the balls, unless you're really fast.,
Once you get a ball, hold on to it until the other team's best players have thrown theirs, then go up and throw it at some of the people who are not as good.,
While getting ready to throw, stay crouched low to the ground and start to sort of gallop towards the line that divides the two sides.,
When throwing, do not be afraid to turn sideways and almost fall then catch yourself with your hand to help increase power.

,
To catch a ball, let it come to you, don't go to it.,
When dodging, always be ready to jump, as they will most likely go for your feet.,
Practice jumping, throwing, and running...the essential ingredients to becoming a good dodge ball player.

,
Think of the game as war.,
Pay attention to all directions.

,
Don't move if someone throws a ball at you!,
A good strategy is to get some friends, then have them all shoot at one player from different points on the field.,
Do not show any mercy whatsoever!,
Be quick on your feet.,
Get two balls and throw one at an enemy's foot.,
- When you're throwing the ball towards an opponent do not aim for the upper body as it makes it easier for them to dodge it or catch it, aim for the shins as they can't catch it and makes it harder for them to dodge it.

",How to Play Dodgeball," If nobody on your team is fast, then let the other team get the balls and just stay back and try to dodge and catch. If you and your team do get them, then roll the extras back to your side so the enemy won't get them.;
, Get the average throwers out first so there are less distractions. If you are a bad thrower, just catch them as they get thrown at you.

, This will help you gain power for the throw. If they throw a ball at you while going towards the middle line, crouching and running up to the line will help you dodge it because you are ready to move quickly and you will be a smaller target. This will make it harder for them to hit your body and when they throw it, it will be towards your head and therefore easier to dodge because instead of moving your whole body you will just have to move your head. And, also, in some games of dodgeball, throwing at the head doesn't count!

,, Let it come to your chest and when it is about two feet from you start to bring your hands up to catch it. By the time it hits your chest your hands should be there to make sure that it has nowhere else to go. This should make sure that you catch it.

, TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO STAY ON YOUR FEET. If you fall down it may look cool but it leaves you a sitting duck for attacks.

,, Pretend that you are fighting for your life and you are facing your greatest rival.

,, Sometimes, it will miss and you can catch it. The oldest trick in the book is to deliberately throw it a little far off from the target, hoping that the person will go in that direction.

, This will help you hit the target.

, Take out the good players first so they don't get teammates out.

, This means no resting or ""time outs"".

, He/she will most likely try to pick the ball up if he or she does throw the second ball at them.

Rotate who is jumping on the trampoline.

,
Game Option 2: Dodge the ball on the Trampoline.,
Throw the ball at the player's feet and legs (getting hit above the waist doesn't count).,
When a player on the trampoline gets hit with the ball, the person who threw the ball gets to take their place on the trampoline.,
Game option 3: Dodge the ball on a trampoline with a net.,
If you want to, you can make a rule that anybody can touch the ball if they and the ball are in the air (i.e.,
You can also have a tournament.",How to Play Trampoline Dodgeball," Get on the trampoline and bounce up and down. All of the other participants roam in a marked off area about 25 feet (7.6 m) by about 15 feet (4.6 m). This area should be about 10 feet (3.0 m) away from the trampoline.;
, You can only throw the ball while in the air. Any player that is tagged with the ball is then out. The last person standing is the winner of the competition. The players that get knocked out early help return the ball to the player on the trampoline.

,, All participants on the ground surrounding the trampoline get to throw balls at the players on the trampoline. Ground participants must not be within arm's length of the trampoline when throwing the ball. This is more unsafe than Game Option 1, but if all 6 safety tips listed below are followed, no one should get seriously hurt.

, Players on the trampoline only jump up and down to avoid the ball.

, There are no winners since it's a continuous replacement of players. You simply quit whenever its time for dinner or time to go home.

, Okay let's face it. Most parents are scared to death that you are going to get killed, so they have a net installed on the trampoline. This is actually better for dodgeball, because you don't have to run and get a ball that went flying in the wrong direction, unless it goes over the net. Anyway... Everybody is on the trampoline, and they have to jump around and not let the ball hit them at all. This is called poison ball (the ball should be on the trampoline just rolling or bouncing around.) If a person is hit, they sit at the edge of the trampoline and roll the ball at people, if they throw the ball and it hits somebody, the person is not out, it doesn't count. This can go on endlessly.

, hit or throw the ball at someone else. If the person is hit while they are on the ground/mat, they are out and proceed to roll the ball at people. If they land on the ball, they are also out). This is called regular trampoline dodgeball.

, In tournaments, you play until there is only one person left standing. All the ones who are out must get off of the trampoline until the next round starts. You can have regular or poison tournaments. These are more fun if there are more than 4 people playing.

Ball Blocking.",How to Win in Dodgeball," If you do stand still, bounce on the balls of your feet to dodge if you need to.Try to stay on the balls of your feet at all times.;
, Also, practice catching balls thrown at your feet. These are the two most common throws you'll see.

,,, When they jump, they'll have a split-second of air-time in which they won't be able to really maneuver much. Use it.

, If your opponent throws at your mid-section or face, try to catch it.

, Being able to drop into a push-up position quickly and recover also helps.

, You'll have more reaction time to get out of the way, and your power shots won't be affected much by the greater distance.

, Try to deflect them in an upward angle (not back at the other team) so that when the deflected ball bounces way up, and then back down, your teammates can catch it, thus eliminating the opposing player that originally threw it while gaining an advantage in the number of balls your team now has.

, When they throw at one of your team, throw at them while they are unaware of your position.


The Lob and Drill technique: Player 1 lobs the ball high in the air. The opponent gets under the ball to catch. Player 2 drills the ball and gets the player out.
The Run and Hit technique: In the middle of the game, you wait for a ball to roll to the back of your side of the court. You, hopefully unnoticed, quickly grab the ball and run back and forth still in the back of the room. Staying behind the crowd either give the ball to a better player, or get down on all fours and dive under a player to quickly drill the ball.
The Sacrifice technique: This is the last resort technique. Player 1 stands in front of the best player and hands them a ball. Using player one as a shield, the better player throws as many balls as possible with protection until the shield gets out.
The Aerial Attack: 1 tall player and 1 short player team up. the taller player puts the shorter player on shoulders. They both CAREFULLY get a ball and drill at the same time.
Sliding Attack: Grab a ball or two. Sprint up to the line at a player who is also close to the line. Throw one ball at them, and, as you do, lean back and, just after you let go, fall completely down on your shoulder blades and slide. Put your feet down to stop quickly. Then, throw the other ball. Get up and dash back to safety as quickly as possible. This works extremely well if there is a ball just on your side of the line.

, Throw the ball before touching the ground. The opponent will be out, but so will you. Be careful not to be hit before throwing the ball.


The Suicide Attack (Version 2): Grab a ball and maybe a friend to increase your chances of hitting someone. Start at the back of your side. Run towards the front while screaming like a banshee. When you're at the front of your side, throw the ball as hard as you can and run back to the back. If you're lucky, you won't get hit!
The Pegging Technique: If someone runs up to the line to throw a ball over, run up and time it so that they are leaning over when you throw. When someone is leaning over, they can't move out of the way fast enough, if they're close.

, If you have a ball, you can use it as a shield to defend yourself by blocking your opponents thrown balls. Try to block their balls with your balls by angling your ball correctly so that their ball will bounce of yours and fly up so you or a team member can catch the ball. Sometimes this is not allowed.

Know how to knock out players.,
Coordinate with your teammates.,
Throw at the strongest players first.,
Get close to the neutral zone to throw tougher balls.,
Aim low to avoid having your balls get caught.,
Push players on the sides of the court out of bounds.,
Grip your ball on the side for a sneaky curve ball.,
Throw at an opponent who just threw a ball.,
Confuse your opponent by looking somewhere else when you throw.,
Don’t throw headshots.",How to Be Great at Dodgeball1," There are several ways that players can be knocked out of the game. It’s important for you to know all of them to strategize your throwing game. These rules provide the foundation for the whole game of dodgeball!Players who are hit with balls are out. These balls can either be thrown directly at them or will be rebounded balls that hit them after bouncing off the walls, the floor, or another player.
Players who step out of bounds are out.
Players who throw a ball that’s caught are out.
Players who cross into the the other team’s territory are out.
Players who throw headshots are out.
Once you get knocked out, you go into the “queue” to wait to be brought back in when someone on your team catches a ball. The queue goes in order of elimination.;
, Even though dodgeball might look like a free-for-all, the best teams work together to make strategies for throwing. Number your opponents from left to right, starting with one and ending with six. Throw multiple balls at one player together to make it harder for your opponents to dodge your attacks.To organize your group throws, make your corner player the designated “caller.” They can pick a player to target and call out that player’s number. Everyone should wait three seconds and then throw at the targeted player together.
You and your teammates should target one player at a time for the best scoring results. If you start thinking too far ahead about knocking out multiple players, you’ll distract yourself from your immediate goal. Stay focused and patient. You’ll get them all in the end., You’re probably tempted to immediately go for the weakest links. This actually isn’t the best strategy. It’s better to go for the best players while you’re at the top of your game. It won’t be good if you have to deal with them at the end when you’re tired and dripping with sweat.To figure out which players are the strongest and weakest, scout out your opponents before the game. Observe one of their games if you can. If not, see if you can find any descriptions of their team online.

, The closer you are to the other side, the more accurate and powerful your throws will be. This will make them much harder to dodge. This is a bit of a dangerous strategy, however, as it also puts you closer to your opponents’ balls. Move fast, throw quickly, and get back to the wall.Be careful not to cross into your opponents’ territory. This will knock you out of the game., If you aim at the chest or mid-section, it’ll be much easier for the other team’s players to catch your balls. Go for below the waist, aiming especially for the shins. These throws will be almost impossible to catch. They’ll also force your opponents to jump, which could provide more opportunities to get them out.If you do aim above the waist, your throws need to be powerful enough to keep your opponents from catching them. Only go with this approach if you have an extremely fast and strong throwing arm.

, If you notice that one of the players on the other team is close to being out of bounds, take advantage! It should be the “caller’s” job to make the team target this player with a group throw. Your opponent could be overwhelmed by the attack and step out of bounds by accident. And then they’re out!, Throwing curve balls can catch your opponents off guard, making it harder for them to dodge your throws. Practice this throw by gripping the ball on the side and throwing it in a half-circle, rather than a straight line. Don’t break this move out in a game until you’ve given yourself plenty of time to perfect it.Try doing a wrap-around curve ball by wrapping your wrist and hand around the ball and letting it loose. This will take even more practice to master, but it should give you some extra power and curve on the release.

, Your opponents are at their most vulnerable right after they’ve thrown the ball. You’ve got a second or two when their attention still isn’t completely re-focused on dodging balls. Target these players.If they’ve just knocked out one of your teammates, this is a great opportunity for some healthy, in-game revenge.

, This fake-out should confuse your opponents, and whoever you target won’t be ready for your throw. Be careful with this move, though. Your throw might not be as accurate, since you won’t be looking at your opponent when you release the ball.This could also be risky because it may give your opponents the chance to take advantage of your divided attention. Even though you’ll still be looking at the other side, you’ll be thinking about where your ball is going to go. This could provide an opening for a sneak attack to catch you off guard.

, It’s against the rules, and it’s dangerous. It’s also a bad move, as it knocks you out of the game. Throwing a ball anywhere near the head or neck isn’t worth injuring someone, especially since it could lose you the game anyway."

Stay back toward the wall.,
Jump high or with split legs.,
Stay aware of the boundaries.,
Spread out to make it harder for the other team.,
Deflect balls with a blocking ball.,
Don’t panic if it’s just you left on your side.",How to Be Great at Dodgeball2," This will put lots of distance between you and your opponents, and it’ll make it harder for them to target you. Don’t stand right against the wall, as this could cause deflected or uncaught balls to hit you from behind once they’ve bounced off the wall. Leave a few feet (or about 1 meter) of space behind you., Since your opponents are probably going to be aiming at your legs, you’ll need to be a good jumper. Practice jumping higher every chance you get. You can also increase your flexibility to split your legs in the air., There’s no more frustrating way to be eliminated than to put a foot out of bounds. Especially if you’re a corner player, stay hyper-aware of your position on the court. This is even more important when you’re dodging, since you’ll won’t be able to dodge in one direction., If you clump together in the center of the court, you’re creating a huge and easy target for your opponents. Even if there are just a few of you left, use the whole court. Always evenly space yourselves out. This will give you room to move around and dodge those balls., Most teams and leagues will allow blocking. This involves a player who uses one ball to keep other balls from hitting them. For some players, it may be easier to learn how to block balls than to dodge them. You can even have designated “blockers” on your team.Blockers can also protect their teammates from getting hit.
Keep a good grip on your blocking ball. If you drop it, you’re out!

, This is what’s called on all-on-one. It has to happen eventually for most games to end, so you’ll probably have to go through this at some point. Focus on dodging and look for that perfect catch, as this will bring back one of your teammates.Stay low and crouched close to the ground during this scary time. This makes you a smaller target.

Be ready to catch every ball.,
Avoid trying to catch balls that are out of reach.,
Catch the ball with both hands.,
Catch the ball in your chest and cradle it.,
Recover quickly after a catch to avoid being eliminated.,
Don’t stall the game by holding balls.",How to Be Great at Dodgeball3," Catching is the underappreciated skill that wins dodgeball games. Remember that catching balls knocks people out just like throwing them. It’s actually better, because now you have another ball to throw and another teammate on your side! Always be prepared to take advantage of this part of the game., Even though you should always be on the lookout for balls you can catch, don’t catch balls that you think you might drop. You drop it, you’re out. If you’d have to reach for the ball even a little bit, let it go., Balls that you can catch with both hands are the golden ones. This means that they’re coming right at you. You’ll also be much more likely to keep control of balls that you can catch with both hands, rather than diving for one that you’d barely pull in with your fingertips.Be sure to catch balls with your whole hand, taking the brunt of the catch on your palms. Fingertip catches are much harder to maintain without dropping them.

, Once you’ve got the ball in your hands, bring it into your chest. You may be able to catch some balls with your whole body, and that’s even better. Cradle it there until you’re sure you’ve got control. This will help you avoid dropping it., Yay, you caught the ball! Now get moving again. Don’t celebrate, as this is the moment when you’ll find yourself targeted. Immediately after you have control of the ball, get back in the game and be ready to dodge and throw again., Stalling occurs when the referee decides that a player is trying to delay the game. Generally, you should be doing something with a ball after having it your hands for a few seconds. This could include blocking, rolling the ball back to the other team, or throwing it. After ten seconds, the ref can call on you for stalling and send you out of the game."

Have a corner player ready to counter opponents.,
Dive or side-jump to dodge countering.,
Eliminate your opponent by distracting them with two balls.,
Add distractions to your game plan.,
Trick your opponents into throwing you a ball you can catch.",How to Be Great at Dodgeball4," Countering is when a player sneaks in from the corner of the court and very quickly moves toward the neutral zone to attack an opposing player. It’s a risky move, and it can only be performed by a single (and brave) countering player. If you’re countering, be speedy and go for the element of surprise.Reserve countering for when you’ve only got a single ball on your side.Countering is a good move to break out after there’s been an elimination. Players might be distracted, and this is the time to strike!, Because counters are all about speed, they’re hard to dodge. You may not be able to jump fast or high enough straight up into the air to get away from this ball. Do a back dive or side-jump to avoid these tough throws.Be extremely careful when you do a back dive. These dangerous moves could injure you, especially if you hit your head on the ground. Try and absorb the fall on the fleshy part of your bottom, and keep your head and neck up off the floor.

, This tricky move is called the “butterfly and the bee.” Throw one ball up in the air to confuse your opponents. While their attention is on that ball, throw a second ball straight at them., Dodgeball can be a fun and even quirky game. If you’re in a league that allows cartwheels and coordinated jumps, do them! You’ll have fun with these slightly weird strategies, and they’ll confuse your opponents.Time a group jump or a cartwheel by using a codeword.
Make sure that these moves don’t get you eliminated. Only do them if you’re sure you can dodge balls while you’re distracting the other team with your unexpected skills.

, This is called a drop-catch. Hold the ball you’ve got in front of you, inviting the other team to target you. Drop the ball, and catch a ball that’s been thrown at you.Only do this if it looks like you’ll be able to catch one of the incoming balls. Otherwise, continue dodging the balls, or keep hold of the ball you’ve got to block them.

, The feet or lower legs is the best spot to aim for getting someone out. Basically the higher you throw the easier someone can catch it subsequently getting you out of the game.

, If you are higher than most people in the game, a good idea would be to stay in the back to avoid the other team throwing to their hit teammates.

, If you can stay in, you owe it to your defensive players to help them out and that means not getting out quickly. Try to use a shield person to help you stay in longer.

, If you are small or are not good at throwing giving your teammates the ball is a better way to go. If you aren't strong at throwing you can get out easier than if you help your team out.

, Although you won't throw the ball quickly and you'll waste a bit of time the best time to throw is when someone that is decent is turned around looking the other way. Another good time to throw is at another player who is throwing and unaware of you.

, Pay attention at all times. Anyway, knowing who has a ball, who just got out, who is not paying attention, who is good that is still in, is key when playing.

Be conscious of what you eat.,
Choose exercises that you enjoy for the weekly workouts.,
Don't do things you do not enjoy.,
Gradually increase the duration and intensity of your exercises.",How to Know How Much to Workout," If you are not eating healthy, then you will never drop any weight no matter how much you workout. You got motivated to go to the gym. An intense workout consisting of resistance training and cardio will burn somewhere between 600-900 calories a session. You worked your tail off and burned 900 calories. Great job!
But instead of going home and eating something healthy, you decide to sit down at Pizza Hut. While eating three slices of a Pizza Hut's pepperoni pizza adds 1020 calories, 111 carbs, and 2760 mg of sodium to your daily intake. The calories you ate have completely trumpeted your hopes of weight loss for the day. Great job in the gym, but your unhealthy choice has set you back.;
, You must mix things up or you will not maintain this healthy lifestyle. If you enjoy swimming, aerobic classes, lifting weights, and running on the elliptical then do just that. Just remember these general guidelines.


When lifting, never train the same muscle group two days in a row. The body needs time to heal the muscles that you worked to make them bigger. Overtraining a specific muscle group will only decrease muscle size. Resistance training for beginners should be done three times a week while more advanced lifters may life as much as six times a week. Remember though, these lifters are not working the same muscle group each and everyday.
Cardio four times a week is recommended. Remember, you must build a lifestyle or eventually all your bad habits will come back and you will be right back where you started. Mix these cardio sessions up and work for duration. If you want more ""bang for your buck"" shoot for forty minutes. This duration will take your body into the fat burn stage for nearly half of your workout. It is important to mix interval training into your weekly sessions as well. Shocking the body with faster paced sprint intervals will burn major calories.
Swimming can be used for cardio as well. Make sure to check our heart rate while in the pool to make sure it is elevated the entire duration.

, Write down your goals and set up a program that works for you. Use these guidelines above and get to work. You can achieve anything you put your mind too.

,

Increase intensity, if that is your goal, gradually over a period of many workouts and record your intensity level.
Record the duration of your workout in a simple format writing on a calender or with more detail in a log.
Eventually when you are at the limit of your capabilities, rely on your log to plan your workout's intensity and duration.

, Consider hand signal systems so you don't give yourself away. Give your second man a room clearing sign and he will throw in a flashbang if he has one. If not, your last man will simply open the door in the best way possible. As your team rushes in, he will come to the back of the line. From here your strategy depends on the number of men in your squad.

Finished.

",How to Choose an Airsoft Retailer," This means less time will be spent asking yourself what it is you desire.;
,,, But be alert! Different websites sell guns, well, differently of course. That JG M4 looks great on airsplat, but then again, the same thing is on airsoftGI but with a red dot sight. Is it the same price for the same thing? THAT'S what you need to look closely at. They should have a list of everything that the package includes. If its just the gun, then it should say gun only (and magazine, charger, etc.).

,, Your shipping address is a HUGE part of your online shopping. If you live in Kentucky, you should expect the shipping times and rates to be different from someone who lives in Alaska. Where the store itself is located is a biggie too. A store in Hong Kong is WAY different from a store in California. Most websites give free shipping over $100 or $150, so that's a big help.


Shipping and handling is a major fear of those who shop online. Many are worried they will receive broken guns or missing pieces or what not. This isn't always the stores fault. They don't handle your product once its out of their storage facility. Its all up to UPS or whatever to get your order to you intact and on time. So if you get a mashed box, don't complain straight to the website you bought it from. Unless of course you can prove the damage was caused before it shipped. However, it IS up to the seller to get you your product on time so that you will be satisfied with their service.

, Blog Mixups - Most everyone has read reviews about certain websites to make sure their services are up to par. In many cases, you will read complaint after complaint, even though most seem true. It is important to remember that whoever wrote that complaint probably doesn't live where you do, and thus may have had a larger chance of a shipping problem or billing problem. Someone who complains about their gun not reaching them in two weeks probably used bad information or there was a freak accident involving their product. Of course, that's not to say it wasn't a problem with the seller too.

, One might offer a better quality guarantee, or another might offer an equivalent exchange for a broken product you received. One of the best things to do when you find a website is to look for their ""About Us"" page and search for their guarantees and return policies.

, Many unfortunate souls are pulled in by impossibly low prices on some websites, and think it's a steal. (This is just an example) A Snow Wolf M24 on ehobbyasia is only $99, and the same gun on evike is $130. Most anyone's brain processes that great looking deal. That M24 sure is nice, and cheap too! Then comes the shipping. It ain't $99 any more! An Asian retailer usually posts cheaper prices, because their country may actually manufacture that M24. Thus, it looks cheaper then it actually will be. Shipping to the US will cost money, and thus that M24 may end up costing $150 or so to get to you! But if you buy from that store located in the continental U.S., it would not only probably be cheaper, but it would be faster too. Imagine that M24 from Hong Kong to New York! Then imagine that same M24 from California to New York! (not to hate on the Asian retailers, this is just how it is)

You (Unit 1) will enter the room first.",How to Clear a Room in Airsoft2," Consider a shout or distraction if no flashbangs were available. You will immediately turn right. Even if there's someone in front of you, leave him. Sweep from right to left after moving against the nearest wall and shoot any enemy you see. Your second man will enter at the same time you do and does the same thing you did with the left. Make sure you and the second man get on walls so 3 and 4 have clear shots to the middle left and right, respectively. Once the threats are taken care of, each teammate should guard an entry (or corner) while you yell, ""Status"". Each teammate will report on who they shot and where they were. Once you are satisfied, call ""stack up"" and line up for the next room.;

, As you move at different angles to the door, you are ""slicing the pie"". Keep your gun at the same place as your eye; not further in, not closer to your body. The point is if you see a bad guy on your section of the pie he doesn't see you first. Keep slicing the pie in baby steps. If you can somehow throw in a flashbang then you could then slice the pie much faster. See Clear-a-Building-with-a-Firearm for more techniques.

Ask questions of the students.,
Try to get feedback and suggestions at the end of the session.",How to Keep Students Attentive During a Training Seminar or Session," This is is the best way to bring others onto your side and ready them for active participation during the event.;
, Before entering the room be well dressed and have an energetic look. This will bring a positive atmosphere into the room. If you are shabbily dressed and wear a gloomy face, it affects the participants' mood. So always give a smile to the participants and have a fresh look.

, Give a brief introduction about yourself. This will help the students to get to know you.

, Have a little session of introduction about the expectations from the session, what the participants can expect to learn and how they will achieve expected outcomes. Explaining this will help in developing a certain bond between you and the participants. It will also allow them to ask questions of you without any hesitation.

, After few topics, try to give a break or interval to ensure freshness. In the middle of the session, give a few real life examples which will divert the concentration of your students, especially if they are in some sleepy mood. Try some good examples which will draw their attention back to the topic which you were explaining to them.

, This helps them to stay participatory and to reflect on what they're hearing and learning. After the completion of any section or topic, try to ask few questions. This ensures a parallel participation between the participants, the trainer and the session will go in a smooth manner.

, At the end of the session, ask for their opinion regarding the session. Having a friendly talk will help to find out whether they need any help on that particular topic and let them know that they can contact the trainer if needed. Share some appropriate jokes and leave the place with a laughter in the room of the participants and a smile and satisfaction on the trainer's face.

Get some face paint.,
Choose which colors to apply.,
Start with light colors.,
Add medium colors to the shiny areas of the face.,
Add dark colors to the outer areas of the face.,
Blend the paint.,
Add an irregular pattern on top.,
Cover your ears and neck.,
Reapply as needed.",How to Camouflage Your Face1," It can be any face paint as long as it has colors that match your environment. You can use wet ashes for black. You can buy camo face paint on Amazon. You can get sticks of camo paint or get a compact. Make sure any pack you get has a light, medium, and dark color with it, for example tan, green, and black. You can get decent camo paint for about $12.If you plan on going in the water (amphibious operations), get grease face paint so that it won't come off.;
, Pick the colors you'll need to blend into where you will be hiding. In forests use green, black, and brown; in deserts use tan, brown and light green; in snow use grey, green and white; in an urban environment use brown, black and grey.If you are going out at night, you can simply paint your face black to blend in.

, Camouflage your eyes, nose, temples, and lower lip with light brown or tan (if not using these colors, simply apply the lightest color you are using). This will obscure the lighter areas of your face and break up your facial pattern, making your face harder to recognize. Make a large rectangle around your eyes so that people don’t see your eye circles. Apply a small amount under your nose in an oval and a small circle under your lower lip. Make sure these are all uniformly colored in.Make sure not to get any paint in your eyes! Exercise caution when painting around your eye area.

, Use a medium green or olive shade on your forehead, cheeks and each side of your chin. Draw a large rectangle on your forehead, two small vertical rectangles on each cheek directly beside your nose, and two small circles on each side of your chin. This will help disguise your facial pattern and obscure areas that are likely to be shiny due to sweat.Instead of a medium green shade, use tan in a desert or grey paint in an urban or snowy environment.

, Use black or dark brown. On the outside of your forehead, draw a square on each side. Draw a medium sized circle on each cheek in the center of the cheek. Draw a small oval on the bottom of your chin in the center. This will further break up the pattern of your face.Covering these areas with darker paint is important because it helps to flatten your face. When your face appears as a flat image, it is difficult to detect., Use your index and middle fingers to lightly rub the paint together so that it gradually transitions from one shade to another. The shapes that you drew should be indistinguishable and have a feathered, airbrushed look., Paint a disruptive pattern on your face on top of the paint. The pattern can help you to blend into the specific area around you, so choose a pattern for your specific location. Use a color based on your surroundings, like a green if you are in the forest. Then blend it in with your fingers so that the pattern doesn’t stand out. This will simulate the texture of your surroundings.In a temperate deciduous forest, use blotches; in a coniferous forest, use a broad slash; in a jungle, use a broad slash; in a desert, use a slash; in the arctic, use blotches; and in grass or an open area, use a slash., Paint your ears a darker color since they stick out and you will want them to appear flat. Use dark green or black. Use lighter colors on your neck such as tan and olive. You can paint a blotch or slash pattern with lighter colors, depending on your location. The important thing is for all of your skin to be covered.If you have a bald head, cover that as well. Use darker colors so that it doesn’t reflect sunlight., When you sweat a lot or your face becomes oily, the paint will begin to wear off. When this happens, wash off your current paint with soap and water or makeup remover and reapply. If this isn’t possible, you can add dust or mud to the shiny areas to disguise them until you can reapply your face paint."
"
Collect grass and leaves.,
Stick foliage into your clothing or gear.,
Remove and replace foliage as it wilts.",How to Camouflage Your Face2," Find them from the area where you will be hiding to best blend in. Don’t use twigs, which will irritate your skin and get in the way. Foliage is best used in addition to another method, such as paint or a bandana. It is difficult to cover your entire face with foliage, but adding some to your camouflage will help you to blend in even better.


Although not very common, applying natural foliage directly on your face is a useful form of camouflage. This works best with the use of a ghillie suit so that your entire body is covered in vegetation.

, If you are wearing a hat, stick a few leaves or blades of grass around the rim. Make sure you don’t cover your eyes. If you are wearing a helmet, you can stick grass or leaves into the strap. You can also cover your neck by sticking some foliage in the top of your shirt.You could also place a few long blades of grass behind your ear.
If the foliage is not staying in place, you could pin, glue, or tape it onto your clothing. Just make sure the adhesive isn’t visible.
Sticking a little mud on the foliage will also help it to stay in place.
You could also buy a mesh mask and place foliage in the holes of the mesh. Just make sure not to cover your eyes, ears, or mouth with foliage.

, For best results, all foliage should be fresh. Wilted foliage will not be effective. Simply gather some more leaves or grass from your surroundings and add them to your clothing or gear."
"
Buy fabric in the color you choose.,
Cut the fabric to fit your face.,
Add more contrast if needed.,
Tie it around your face.",How to Camouflage Your Face3," You could buy a camo pattern, a printed leaf and grass pattern, or a plain color like olive green. Choose the color based on your surroundings. For sufficient material to make a bandana, be sure the fabric is at least 2 feet (0.61 m) by 2ft. Consider using fabric that is 100% cotton or polyester for breathability. You can buy fabric at your local arts and crafts store or on Amazon for around $10., A standard bandana is 22 inches (55.9 cm) by 22 inches. If you want a larger one, you could make it 27 inches (68.6 cm) by 27 inches. To keep the bandana from unravelling, you can sew a hem around the outside. Simply fold the fabric in about an inch and stitch around the outer edge., You can add more camouflage or contrast to your bandana if you would like. Use spray paint in tan, green, and black and add splotches to your bandana. You could also use fabric paint or markers. Feel free to decorate it how you see fit. You could add some stripes to simulate grass or blotches to look like leaves. You can also fasten foliage to your bandana.

, Fold the fabric in half diagonally and wrap it around your face with the large part in the front and the narrow part in the back. The bandana should face down, forming a “V” shape towards your neck. Cover your nose and mouth but keep your eyes uncovered. Tie a double knot in the back of your head with the ends of the fabric. Secure it tightly so that it stays in place, but not too tight where it is uncomfortable.

Find a full face mask.,
Choose a mask with a pattern similar to your surroundings.,
Look at several masks and buy the best option.,
Wear your mask.",How to Camouflage Your Face4," You can buy them on Amazon for about $10. They come in many different forms, from full masks that only have eye holes to a bandana-style mask that covers the lower part of your face. The best mask for you depends on what you will use it for, but for best coverage, buy a full face mask that only has eye holes. Just make sure it allows for full peripheral vision so that you can see clearly., For example, choose one with leaves if you will be in a forest. You can choose one in a color that matches your surroundings as well, like brown if you will be in a forest with bare trees, or green if your surroundings will have a lot of foliage. You can also buy one with a combination of greens and browns, with leaf and grass patterns.The best camouflage will come from a mask with a realistic pattern rather than a standard color pattern in camo. The advantage of masks is that you can make your face look exactly like nature rather than just similar in color.
If you are going out at night in a dark area, an all black mask will work well.

, There are many masks to choose from. Take a look at several to compare and contrast. Pay attention to the color and pattern. You don’t need to worry too much about size because most masks are one size fits all. Many are polyester or spandex for breathability, but you could also get one made of neoprene for added warmth., No other preparation is needed. A mask is instant camouflage! Just make sure it fits securely so that it won’t fall off.

Drill 2 holes in a small container.,
Deconstruct a regular pen.,
Insert the pen into the hole in the bottom of your container.,
Unscrew the cap and put some BBs inside.,
Blow in the hole in the side and watch the BBs come out the barrel.",How to Build an Airsoft Gun out of Household Objects1," An old pill bottle, a film container, a plastic bottle of Coca-Cola, whatever you have lying around (with a lid!) will do. Be sure to wash it first, though; you'll be putting the side of the bottle in your mouth.


One hole needs to be centered on the bottom and the other centered on the side.
A 5/16"" drill bit is best for a standard pen, but it can vary. Choose a drill bit that matches the width of your pen, as the pen will be inserted through the hole shortly.;
, You know, the kind they give you at hotels and seminars for free. A straight-tubed, not fancy, ballpoint pen with no frills. There are three steps to this:


Unscrew the cap surrounding the ink point.
Take out the guts -- the ink, the spring -- to create an empty barrel for your BBs to fly through.
Ram out the lid at the top with a screwdriver or other slim, pointed object.

A sturdy straw will also do the trick.



, It should protrude about 1/2"" (1.25 cm) into the inside of the container. A regular pen should fit fairly snugly into a hole drilled with a 5/16"" bit.


It's a good idea to hot glue the barrel to the bottom of the medicine bottle. Just put a ring of glue around the pen where it meets the edge of the container. This way no air will escape, pressurizing your BBs.

, A little less than half full is ideal.

, Experiment with distance and aim -- you should be able to go a considerable distance away (the length of your garage, say) and still maintain direction and velocity.


Do not inhale with your mouth up against the container. You could inhale pellets and choke. Instead, take a breath away from the gun and then blow inside.

Thread the adapter into the blowgun and remove the nozzle.,
Drill a hole into the side of the soda bottle.,
Insert the nozzle into the hole from the inside.,
Screw the blowgun into the nozzle.,
Drill a hole into your bottle cap.,
Thread the brake line onto the bottle cap.,
Fill the bottle with Airsoft pellets.,
Screw the barrel in place and attach to an air compressor.,
Fire away!",How to Build an Airsoft Gun out of Household Objects2," By blowgun, we mean one that attaches to an air compressor -- not a blowgun you would use to throw poison darts into your nearest enemy. Screw the adapter in until it's sturdy and tight.


The nozzle of the blowgun (where it would connect to the tube of an air compressor) will twist out counterclockwise.

, It should be about 1"" (2.5 cm) below the bulge in the top of the bottle. It should also match the size of the nozzle of the blowgun that you just threaded out.


If you refer the method above, you'll see that a regular pen requires a 5/16"" drill bit. Your nozzle is probably just a bit bigger than that.

, This is the trickiest part:


Put the nozzle into the bottle.
With a metal file or other similar, long, thin object, pick up the nozzle.
Place it snugly into the drilled hole, threaded part sticking out.

, Keep the metal file supporting the nozzle so the weight of the blowgun doesn't dislodge it. Be patient as you thread the blowgun onto the nozzle.


Once it's tightened, the blowgun should be sturdy and unmoving. At this point, the soda bottle and blowgun base should be as one.

, It needs to match the size of your brake line. It's better to start off a bit smaller and have to make it bigger -- though you could always easily find another bottle cap.

, Pull the line through so the entire tube is through the cap, bolts and nut on the exposed end.


If available, it's wise to seal the drilled hole on the cap with hot glue. This will also hold the line in place, creating a foolproof vacuum.

, About halfway is ideal.

, Make sure everything is sealed up nice and tight and attach the base of the blowgun to your air compressor.


Alternatively, you can also use a backpack air supply to fuel your gun.

, Your gun is ready to start decimating. Just unscrew the barrel to refill with pellets.

",How to Be an Airsoft Sniper," No one can tell you how many times an airsoft sniper will go head over heels on his role, knowing nothing about it, and end up getting frustrated, and either leave airsoft entirely, or get a new weapon. Try using an AEG on semi auto only for a while, see how you like it, and if it suits your play style more, then maybe look into buying or making a ghillie suit, and switching to a rifle such as a Maruzen, Tokyo Marui, or Tanaka. Clones (UTG/WELL/BE/AWP) more than often are made in such mass produced numbers that quality will almost always lack, and the 470 FPS that you see with a .2 will wear down to around 410 FPS with a .2 after around 500 shots. Visit online forums for more information on upgrades.;
, They cost about 25-100 dollars. You might want to invest your money in a sidearm as they generally do not cost much and are very handy when you get into a cornered up situation. Nothing is worse than having your position recognized and get charged by the enemy with nothing to defend you but your rifle. A pistol and a holster are recommended. While spring is better for a sniper rifle a side arm needs to be at least semi-auto. If your side arm is a fully or semi automatic then you need to bring an adequate amount of ammunition (Usually 2-3 magazines depending on magazine capacity) with you and still have enough for your rifle. This is because it is embarrassing to have all of your side arms filled and ready, wait two hours, see your target and pull the trigger, then hear the always glorious sound of nothing but air come out of your rifle.

, FPS is not very important, as long as it is at least has 300 FPS. Its not bad to have a high FPS though. You should get airsoft bbs, depending on how many FPS your sniper rifle has. Normally heavier bbs are better than light bbs, due to the fact that heavier bbs will give you more accuracy in normal weather and windy weather.
A spring pistol with at least 275 FPS is good with .20 gram bbs since you'll use them at close range.

, Research your gun's statistics as much as possible. Spend a good amount of time getting to know your gun, and how the shots react under different conditions (wind, temperature etc). Fiddle with the hop up setting on your gun (if it has one) and find where you like it positioned most. Take a while to get to know your guns' unique shots and practice with them all the time. Learn your gun's maximum effective range; that is, the range it'll still be accurate at.

, Usually all airsoft snipers think that they'll be getting more kills than anyone on the field, when in reality, they usually get the least. Also, sniping might sometimes even be boring. Often, you find yourself sitting under a pile of branches and waiting for an enemy to show up (depending on the game). Know that observation and sabotage are your main friends in the field, your rifle only serves as a tool to help you in your various roles needed on the field as directed by your commander or squad leader.

, There are literally thousands of aftermarket parts for airsoft sniper rifles. Depending on your rifle there could be hundreds of upgrades you could do. Some upgrades can include getting a more powerful spring, getting a better scope (if you choose to have one), or even simply a paint job to help it better blend in to your surroundings.

, The bb of choice should also have a heavier weight than most (such as a .43g bb). Brands such as Bioval, Maruzen, Madbull (heavies), and Goldenball are ideal.
Components that help improve your compression are next up. To start off, test your compression by placing your finger over the nozzle of the cylinder head. Fire the action and if the air leaks out, you need to improve compression. Start off fixing your compression by adding teflon tape to the threads of your cylinder head. Next, replacing your piston with one from a reputable brand will help. Other things to help compression is wrapping teflon tape between your bucking and inner barrel. There are also custom made rings that go over the bucking to provide 100% airseal. Contact Noobie and ASR for more information.
Replace your stock barrel with a precision inner barrel. This should be done before any fps mods or upgrades are done. Brands such as Laylax, EDGI, and PDI are regarded as the best. If available (as it is for the vsr-10), replace your hopup bucking.
Reinforcement. This should be done with major fps upgrades. Reinforcement parts include bolt handles, new cylinders, retaping screws, and new screws.

, Leapers(c) make decent entry level airsoft scopes (Remember in airsoft you don't need and $1200 tactical scope). A 3-9x40scope is a classic choice at around $40. But, keep in mind that many actual snipers only use a 4x32 scope, and try to get a scope with adjustable parallax.The more you zoom with a scope, the less accuracy you will have. Bipods are extremely helpful in assisting with accuracy and also they are great for sustaining a stable shooting position for long amounts of time. You can also make field expedient bipods/rests from branches, sticks and other natural features.

, This will hide you from enemies and opposing snipers. Make sure it is comfortable because you will be wearing it for a while. A ghillie suit should be made of generic colours, brown, lighter brown, some green might help. The long strips are handy for tying in natural elements of your surroundings. For instance, if you are in the woods, pick up some sticks and leaves from the forest floor, and tie them on to your suit (the webtex concealment vest is perfect for natural camo). Use enough that you will blend in, but use variety. Also, try to stay in the same type of terrain from your start point to your objective ,otherwise, you must adapt your camo to your changing surroundings.

, Only high-polish BBs will do, others will ruin high-performance sniper rifle barrels and internals. Biodegradable BB's are expensive, and are usually lower quality than normal BB's. Your ammo should weigh at least 0.25 grams, .30 gram or heavier is recommended for maximum accuracy. Remember: Higher weight equals higher accuracy and lower FPS, but heavier BB's carry more kinetic energy for longer distances.

, We suggest practicing the art of stealth at night with your friends(teammates) by trying to sneak back to safe zone undetected. If you are caught you have been captured, therefore you are finished. Alternate between teams, once you are familiar with your guns. Move slow and be sure to watch the enemy. This is the most important step! You must take the time to study your environment. Instead of seeing things as trees or bushes, think of them as a good hiding place or a fallback point. Also, watch which way the wind is blowing. If you are in a grassy field and the wind is blowing south, move south. It will better camouflage your movements. If you are leading a large or maybe a even small group of snipers make the escape route known to all members of the group.

, You may not always get along with your comrades, but when you see one in trouble, help out unless you are in a key position and firing will reveal your location.

, You must know how to snipe in woods and open fields. When you are going to wait for a long period of time, make sure you are in a position that doesn't put much strain on individual muscles. It is not worth it to be detected just so you can stretch your arms or legs. Also, become familiar with changing your ghillie suit to adapt to terrain.  This means it would help making your own ghillie suit and before you start grab some of the terrain from the field.

, Make mental notes of good sniping positions, good observation points, and well covered areas for a retreat, this is very important.

, Nothing is more frustrating then realizing you’re going to be overwhelmed because you had no idea how big the other team was. More than likely you will see them in the safe zone. Use this time to find out more about them.

, Be patient. You may only be able to move a couple feet a minute. Set up an ambush or pick off advancing enemies. The best position for a sniper is the prone position, which keeps you hidden the most. However crouching is an alternative in very dense areas. Standing up is when you are a more obvious target. Don't reveal your whole silhouette, profiles are harder to see.


Don't be afraid to get dirty! Lay on your belly under a bush or crouch on a low hanging branch with lots of leaves. Poke your gun out of the bush. It is better to have some cover rather than none.

, If you are on a deep strike mission (picking off an enemy commander from behind their lines), always know your way out. If you don't, the enemies will hear your shot and hunt you down. (They might not, because this is airsoft). When you set up an area to shoot from, try to have at least two routes of escape. Make sure both have cover should your opposition catch up.

, Take one or two shots and then move on. NEVER STAY IN ONE POSITION FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME unless you are waiting to ambush or trap. But again, stay low on your belly. A sniper should only move when there is assurance of no hostile operatives in the area, and even when he moves, he should move avoiding any detectable changing of position. Crawl with your fingers and toes, not elbows and knees, or any way you see fit. Be patient this might be painfully slow. When you crawl, keep your heels together, and move your toes to go forward. This is known as the sniper low crawl. Never use a crawl higher than the infantry mans low crawl

, When you see something that wasn't there before, get down, pull out your binoculars(if you have any), and take a closer look.

, Learn which shots to take. For instance try to take out high priority targets such as Commanders, VIPs, etc.

, Silicon spray is useful for a full on clean, don't just spray it down the barrel. After you finish spraying, use a cleaning rod and cloth to clean it off. Using rubbing alcohol will also clean out your inner barrel more effectively than silicon spray.

, Remember to know your teammates and what position they are. Nothing is more embarrassing than taking out your own teammate because you thought that you didn't have a support gunner.

, Keep a close eye on your prey and remember the rule of the sniper is to spot them before they spot you.

, Few airsofters realize the importance of stealth when returning from a mission. In airsoft, there is no such thing as a safe zone. Everywhere is a hostile situation, and should be treated as thus. As a sniper, no shot is easier than enemy units returning to their home base (Note that this is two way. While you want to avoid being an easy target while returning home, try setting up near an enemy base, and shoot the patrols as they return)., When in the safe zone, look for important targets and memorize what they are wearing, what gun they are using.

,,
Be careful to not move because it is very easy to spot a moving sniper or walking bush. Remember you need patience.
If you need to move, move slowly. About a foot per minute.

,
If you only spot one target, wait until you have a clear shot and take him down.

,,
If they are more than 100 feet (30.5 m). away try to quick hide after going around a corner and take out your pistol.
If they are closer try to escape them by running around a lot of corners and going over obstacles to try to slow them down.

Know the Airsoft scout's main purpose is to look for the enemy's position and report that information back to the team.,
The weapons a scout would mostly use are Sub-machine gun, shotgun, M4/M16, or any rifle that has a ris rail.,
The gear a scout would use would be light and be able to carry your stuff securely and wouldn't make a lot of noise.,
Know the tactics.,
Do some effective training.",How to Be an Effective Airsoft Scout," A scout could also be a person who's main role is to engage the enemy at close-quarters. You can also have two people be scouts and work together.;
, Also in a scout's arsenal he/she could also have an Airsoft grenade, claymore, or any DD (distraction device).


There are 3 main types of Airsoft guns the first is AEG or the electric Airsoft gun it uses a battery pack and a gearbox and as a rule of thumb if there are more metal items in the internals of the gun then it will be less likely to break. Gas Guns are Airsoft guns that utilize Co2, propane or green gas as its power source.






Most airsoft pistols you buy at a store like Dick's or Walmart use Co2. Higher end Airsoft pistols or small arms you put the propane or green gas in a port at the bottom of the magazine. If you choose to use propane, buy an adapter so you can screw it to the the propane tank and use that.






Spring Airsoft guns or springers are the ones you buy at Walmart and break after a week but not all springers are bad most sniper rifles are spring-powered are excellent. Also all shotguns are spring and if you plan on getting a shotgun go for a tri-shot.







, A tactical vest with pockets for your extra clips, side arm, and any other stuff you might want. For protection, you should always wear ANSI rated full seal Goggles and a wire mesh lower face mask so you don't get a tooth shot out or hit in the face. You can also wear gloves if you don't like getting hit in the hands. Boots or hiking shoes you can run in are recommended. Some sort of camouflage will help you remain undetected in the field. Your gun is one of the most noticeable parts of your person so it is generally a good idea to camouflage it.

, Since a scouts main purpose is to spy on the enemy and battle with them in a smaller area you want to be stealthy, quick, and accurate. Don't be yelling out where you are or stepping on a lot of leaves and branches or randomly shooting.


Move when there is some cover noise so you won't be heard and if you you see the enemy you have 1 of 2 choices either get back to your team or get close enough and open fire. If you decide to shoot then make sure your first shot counts meaning go for the leader or the person with the most fire power. And since you're alone and backup is too far away, you want to make sure you can't be seen. When they hear the first shot they are looking around and that is when you make your move and open fire from you vantage point.







, Practice shooting a target at 10,20,and 30 yards (27.4 m) and try to walk in the area you will be battling most of the time and try not to make a lot of noise and look for vantage spots also. Be able to run in all your gear for at least 2 minutes. Practice shooting while prone, kneeling, and standing up. If you have a two person scout team practice working together and creating crossfire and diversions and set up ambushes. You can also look up Airsoft tactics on other articles.

Make a base block.,
Get a 2 by 4 approximately 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) long.,
Now, attach two 6"" diameter wheels that do not swivel to the underside of the piece.,
Use two 4 by 4 inch blocks of wood about 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) long to attach to the 2 by 4 you already put on the board.,
Put a 2 by 4 about 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) long along the tops of the 4 by 4 blocks.,
Now for the barrel.,
Do not attach the barrel with screws or nails.,
Build a chickenplate.,
Get some ""shells."",
Personalize it.,
If and only if you live in states that allow them, you can use bottle rockets, put them in the bottles, have a buddy light them, and shove them in the breach.",How to Build an Airsoft Artillery Piece," Use a good, strong piece of wood about 2 feet (0.6 m) by 2 feet (0.6 m). This will be what everything else is built on.;
, Attach this to the top center of the 2 by 2 foot board with the end of the 2 by 4 matching up with the opposite side of the board so now it sticks out. This will be the boom that controls the aim of the piece.

, You can get them at any home improvement store, but make sure they're the ones that come pre-assembled so that you can just screw them on. (I drilled pilot holes first and then used a screwdriver.)

, Make sure they are both on the 2 by 4. When you look down the barrel of your artillery piece, they should be in line with each other because they are going to be the things holding the barrel up.

, This will be what your barrel sits on top of.

, A THICK PVC tube anywhere between 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) long is required at about 2-2 1/2 inches in internal diameter (caliber, really.) If the barrel is not thick, the barrel may melt and deform.

, Instead, use string and wrap it around the barrel and the 2 by 4 it's laying on. This, or you could use brackets, but string is easier, simpler, and less expensive. Really any thing that does not interfere with the inside of the barrel could be accepted.

, You may be wondering how you're going to be protected from incoming fire. The answer: build a chickenplate. They are often used on the tops of Humvees to protect the gunner from incoming rounds. Yours could either be made from cardboard or wood. Cardboard is more fair, but I would recommend wood because it holds up better to the elements. Make sure it's something light, like pine, or it'll be too heavy to move around. Get yourself a nice big sheet and cut it down to the size you think is suitable. Remember, this is what's saving yourself from going ""out"" in a firefight.

, Soda bottles work perfectly for this role. Anything under 20 oz should just fit right in the breach. Don't use water bottles because they are too flimsy. Get about 6 ""shells."" You will need them.

, Put your team emblem or name on it. You could add a holster to your side of the Chicken Plate just in case, or even cut a hole in the chicken plate and mount a high capacity AEG (Like a cheap $30 P-90) for use as an ""MG"" so you can rain down fire on a location in two ways. It's up to you, make it what you think is best for your situation.

, I would recommend the tiny ones that whistle and pop for a flashbang effect without the flash. Those deafen the people it detonates next to and could cause them to be combat ineffective for a few seconds while somebody runs for cover or to a flanking maneuver. Bottle rockets do very little in shrapnel damage, but should still never be pointed intentionally at the enemy, just near them is enough.


Another suggestion for ammunition is roman candles. Stick them in the bottles and tape where the stick part comes out so it does not fall out of the bottle. These have some kick and do not stop firing until they are completely done, so make sure you push it securely into the breach, even up the barrel a bit. Either that, or tape it. Trust me, you do not want one blasting its way out of the breach and exploding behind the piece. They can burn quite a bit if one of the balls hit you. Again, this is an area-effect weapon, not to be used for direct fire. Shoot above or to the sides of your intended target so you don't leave your enemy with burns.

Learn the touch.,
Learn the movement: You always need to be on your toes.,
Practice shooting.,
If you think you have mastered this, try it after turning on the ball and after receiving it first touch, then try shooting first time.,
Finish well.,
While different coaches may think different things are more important than others, the listed requirements above are musts.,
Work around your strengths with the team, since it is a team game.

,
Improve what you are good at.",How to Be a Good Soccer Striker," Even the best players in the world work on their 'touch' consistently. This is your feel for the ball and your ability to control it quickly first touch. To begin working on other areas of your game, you need to have a great first touch first. Individually, kicking repeatedly against a wall and controlling it (although simple) is extremely effective. However small possession games like 2 Vs 2, 4 Vs 4, or even 1 Vs 1 with small cones as goals using a '2 touch rule' is ideal. In small possession games be as 'creative' as you can. Even if you think it looks stupid, do it. Creativity is the centre of a striker's game. For creativity and effectiveness, you need constant movement from teammates.;
, Improving speed, strength, and agility. As a striker, it is critical to keep moving (in different directions). As a striker, you must annoy and confuse defenders. Next time you play a game with your back to goal, try running circles around a couple of defenders before curling out for a run or check out before you come in to receive the ball and hold it up. You always have the edge if you are constantly moving. Don't make yourself easy to mark, as it will also give you less time on the ball. The number one rule is not to run straight, but always curl your runs. This will also allow you to beat even the most aggressive offside traps with practice.

, Shooting is a striker's number one skill. Technique in shooting is a fine art. Practice against a wall if by yourself by standing about 5 meters (16.4 ft) away and hit the ball slightly with the outside of your foot, just slightly off the instep. Keep doing this although it seems too 'straight' and a bit awkward with no power. After this move 15 meters (49.2 ft) back and start to drive the ball. You want to hit it so it just hovers a bit off the ground (Cm's) with maximum power and accuracy. Most common mistakes are getting ""cross footed"" which is swinging your leg around too much and leaning back and taking eyes of the ball. Don't be fooled, top corner shots and curling free kicks are attractive but the very best strikers can powerfully drive the ball low.

, Heading is different altogether. Get someone to cross the ball to you and don't be afraid. It hurts when you don't 'go for it' and just let it hit your head. Look closely at the ball (don't close eyes!) and put your head and body behind it. You tell the ball where to go. Don't let it bounce off you.

, Compared to shooting, finishing is a bit of an art. In situations where you have just the keeper to beat or finish a fine passing build-up, you need to have a quick mind and a calm head. Too many strikers try to 'smash it' in these situations where you are more likely to score by 'slotting' it or 'placing' the ball in the net. The only way to practice this is by putting yourself in these situations. Game practice is essential. Good touch is so important again.

, If you master these general concepts entirely, you will most definitely improve. Everyone has their own strengths.

,, Self technique is crucial. It very important for you like when you face enemy defender and you can use your self technique to 'duke them out'. For self technique, don't do dukes and dribble like a robot. Do each one the way you feel natural doing it. If the same duke is done differently each time, then the defenders will be in awe whenever you get past them.

A sniper is not a lone wolf.,
Your spotters job is to spot targets for his partner.,
Aside from the ghillie suit that the spotter should wear matching a sniper’s ghillie the spotter should have several pieces of equipment that the sniper will not.,
Now let’s look at the sniper’s job.,
You need to be a great marksman.",How to Be an Airsoft Scout Sniper Team1," That bears repeating: a sniper is not a lone wolf. He should always have a spotter covering his back ready to call a target, protect the sniper, or even radio information back to the commander.;
, When we watch a movie or play a video game we don’t need to worry about how the bullet travels. This is very unrealistic. BBs which you will be using in your rifle are affected by everything from gravity to wind and you as a spotter needs to be able to gauge how these and other factors will affect a sniper’s shot. This once again show’s us the age old motto, “One shot, one kill.” The only way for you as a spotter to predict how conditions will affect a sniper’s shot is through practice. #A sniper team must be constantly working to maintain their abilities. And this includes the spotter observing the shots even when they are only practicing. Some spotters view the time when their partner is practicing as free time to spend just hanging out but this couldn’t be anymore false. A spotter and sniper need to always work together to assure the best shots.

, One of the most important pieces of equipment a spotter has is either binoculars or some type of spotting scope. The spotting scope he chooses should be of similar magnification to the optics on the sniper’s rifle. He should also be armed with some sort of carbine rifle. The spotter’s secondary job is to provide close quarter protection for the sniper and he can’t do that with a bolt-action rifle. What the spotter needs to realize is that unless they are engaged, the spotter will rarely fire a round. Let’s face it, it is not his job to be the one who triggers.

, He needs to be able to pull off a shot that normal infantry cannot. That’s what it means to be a sniper. He needs to have a good rifle that is maintained and has an fps (feet per second) of at least 450. He needs optics (scope) that has similar magnification to that of his spotter’s binoculars or spotting scope. Aside from the normal rifle a sniper needs to have a sidearm that can protect him in most situations. I don’t recommend any automatics just a simple, reliable, pistol. If on the off chance you are discovered you can’t just sit there while your spotter attempts to hold the enemy off with his rifle, and you definitely can’t do it with your sniper rifle so you need to be a great shot with that pistol and have plenty of ammo for it.

, And that comes from tedious unending hours of practice. So the way to be the best is to waste a whole lot of time firing your guns. Both sidearm and primary weapon. So to help you become the sniper of your dreams I included a few tips on how to become great.

Stopper: A player who is good at stopping attacks in the center. You need only 1 stopper.






Sweeper: A player who plays between the fullbacks and goalie, this player has to be quick and tough. You need only one sweeper.







, For example, take a midfielder who has been proven to score goals. Then take your first pick centre forward. Play the centre forward in the mid-fielder's position and vice versa.

Be prepared for multiple roles.,
Pick your weapon type carefully.,
Make some camouflage.,
Train the position that gets killed most.,
Prepare for the roles you might have to fill.,
Consider using a turret.",How to Become a Multi Purpose Airsoft Teammate," When playing, it is essential to have every role filled. Not a good thing when an important member gets killed in the game. Get a Kalashnikov AK47 Assault Rifle or M4A1/M16A3 Assault Rifle. These weapons and weapons related are great ideas for multiple purpose shooting.;
, Spring is not advised, these take a considerable amount of time and you could be shot in between firing and pulling the spring back. Get Gas, C02, or Electric. Gas is smelly, but works for weapons to get 500fps. C02 is not as advised because of the constant need to change it, but works well for getting fast, close range combat done. Electric is most advised with 450+fps and no need to constantly change it; it is also slightly noisy.

, This is essential. It would not be a good idea to be in a green area with a yellow shirt and jeans.

, If you need a constant role of sniper, train that.

,


When being a sniper, the Kalashnikov AK47 is a good weapon for this. If you need to run or shoot fast, you can switch the fire rate to full auto and gun down multiple enemies. It also has a hop setting that is easily accessed and can be used to manipulate obstacles. If an enemy is hiding behind a tree, adjust your hop to hit them in the side multiple times.
If you are a heavy gunner, med capacity magazines are advised. Even though it is more reloading, it is faster to reload a magazine than to wind 50 pellets. Always wear decent armor. You will be under heavy fire at times. AirSoft pellets are NOT soft.
Support gunners are an important part of your escape from enemies. If an enemy convoy moves on top of you, your support gunner will begin firing at the convoy to get their attention while the rest of the squad moves to a vantage point. You will need lots of ammo for this position. It is advised that you have good armor. A convoy against one person with an Assault rifle is not to be underestimated. The pellets fly fast and many fly at once.
Frontmen are important for a few reasons. They act as an ambusher, but can know when the enemy is coming, this is an important part for the support gunner as he/she is required to cover the frontmen from fire in order to help save the team. Frontmen need to be stealthy too, if you are running from the enemy alone and you run like you just saw a ghost on a hurdle course, you are going to be spotted.
Shotgunner people are good for close range combat, but cannot be used with an assault rifle. Buy a small shotgun to go with your trigger happy personality. These can count as instant kills when used inside range. These can offer a spread shot, but there are also single shot shotguns too. Practice with these by shooting at a close target for single shot. For spread shot, this is not needed, but the spring may be tougher.

, If you have a go cart and a closed course, a turret is advised. Always build some sort of road and stay on it. If you use a turret, high capacity mags are needed. You can also buy two assault rifles of the same kind and create a stand. Two battery powered weapons are recommended. Make sure you have at least 30+ extra mags or someone who can reload your mags fast. The stand should comfortably brace the weapons and be able to rotate. This will allow you to shoot anything to the driver's back. Never shoot to the front, the pellets do not travel very fast and may jam the gun when moving the direction you're firing.

Be aware of the ball and any shooting opportunities.",How to Be a Good Central Midfielder in Soccer," Central midfield is the most challenging position to master because the game revolves around you and it takes time be a good midfielder.;
, Check out How to get fit. Build stamina. It's important to be a good athlete; it is crucial to be fit for this position. It is the most important position on the field. (You shouldn't be pacey; it's actually unnecessary to be fast).

, Work on your skills. Ball skills should be above average or exemplary because you are the man who holds the ball for most of the time and you cannot lose the ball.

You should be able to control, pass and receive the ball well. (Not only with your feet but other parts of your body like chest and thighs.)
Be able to dribble very well.

, If you are not good at passing, do not bother to play in the midfield (CAM ,CM, CDM). The midfield is were the magic happens were the people with the best skill of distributing the ball play. You must to play in the air and on the ground with short passes both of which should be weighted properly. You should be the player who can read and analyse the game and spot runs your team-mates are making and execute a pass.


This is crucial as central midfielders should be able to create more chances for their team to score. This is why they are called playmakers.

, Central midfield is not only about attack. You are the engine that keeps the team going offensively and defensively.

Don't overcommit and stab! Force the offense to make a mistake or force them to play the ball backwards!







, Always take note of who is around you and move into space when off the ball.


Have good vision. This will enable you to move the ball around well and create scoring opportunities. You as a center Mid has to control the play. This means distributing the ball and checking to every ball.
Shoot when you can. It is not a crucial part of midfield but given you are not usually in the box, an occasional nice shot is always a great bonus.

, A midfielder and forward might exchange a few passes on the side and then a defender (a third player) will break towards the goal from behind to receive the ball – almost out of nowhere.

, A player can play a wall-pass (a give and go) just to get more time on the ball if he’s being closed down (static), or can play the ball and then sprint into the space to receive the ball. Keeping the ball moving relieves pressure and opens up space. Quick passes (the ball moves much faster than anyone else) breaks down a defense.

, Two or three passes on one side of the field and suddenly there’s no space, the defense has closed the offensive team down, and that’s when they look for a long switch to the defender or midfielder on the other side. In soccer terms it's called, ‘short short long’ or 'switching play' – a few short passes and then a long pass. At times, this switch, when done cleverly, can surprise the other team, who is preoccupied on one side, and results in a chance for a goal or a cross.

, A team may just hunker down and pack their players into their goal box and leave one player up high, waiting to break down the field when they win possession.

, Don’t knock the long ball. Watch how a team might pick out their forward with a long ball. The forward will control the ball and enable the rest of his team to move up the field. Or, one long pass can lead to a perfect lay off or flick to an on rushing player for a goal.

, A wide defender might make a run around the outside midfielder, who has cut inside, and join the attack. An effective cross creates a goal scoring chance.

, One player might dribble right at another player and exchange the ball, the other player screening the defender for a moment.

, Look for a subtle back heel to an unseen player, looking in one direction but playing the ball the other, dribbling to the right but serving a long diagonal pass to the left side (you know that player is there). Watch for that one more pass that almost doesn't seem necessary but results in a tap in goal.

, Watch how they change pace once they’ve made a move. It could be a cut, a feint, or a step-over. Sometimes it's a fake shot, a subtle shoulder dip and then a burst of speed.

Listen for the whistle.,
Watch for the advantage.,
Watch for direct free kicks.,
Watch for indirect free kicks.,
Watch for the penalty kick.,
Watch for the yellow card.,
Watch for the red card.,
Watch for other signals.,
Watch for goal signals.",How to Understand Soccer Referee Signals," A referee who blows his whistle has seen something, most often a foul, or stoppage in play, which requires him to immediately terminate play and deal with the situation. The whistle tone will often indicate the nature of the foul. A short, quick whistle indicates a lesser foul only punished by a free kick, and longer, harder blasts indicate serious fouls punishable by cards or penalty kicks.;
, A referee who, without blowing his whistle, points both arms out, has seen a foul but has decided to play advantage. In advantage, the referee delays the call because he believes that the fouled team still has the advantage in the situation. Typically the referee will give around 3 seconds to determine who comes out on top. If, at the end of the 3 seconds, an advantage was gained by the fouled team, such as possession being kept or a goal being scored, the foul will be ignored by the referee. If the foul warranted a card, however, he will show the card at the next stoppage in play.

, To signal a direct free kick, or DFK, a referee will blow his whistle and point with a raised arm in the direction of the goal that the team who has been awarded the free kick is attacking. A DFK is awarded when one of the players commits one of the ten penal fouls against an opponent. A goal may be scored from a DFK.

, If after signaling for a free kick the referee keeps his hand above his head then he is signaling for an indirect free kick, or IFK. An IFK is awarded for any foul not falling under the category of penal foul, or a foul which is not committed against opponents. A goal may not be scored from an IFK until it has touched another player. When signaling for an IFK, the referee will keep his hand up until after the ball has been kicked and touched by another player.

, A referee who points directly to the penalty spot, or the spot two-thirds of the way between the penalty area line and goal area line, is indicating that a player has committed a DFK offense within his own penalty area and a penalty kick has been issued.

, A referee who shows a player a yellow card is indicating that the player has committed one of the seven cautionable offenses. A player who is issued a yellow card is noted by the referee, and if a second yellow card is issued, the player is sent off. Under National Federation rules (US high school), a player must leave the field after receiving a yellow card (caution). The cautioned player may be replaced, and/or may re-enter on the next available substitution opportunity.

, A referee who shows a player the red card is indicating that the player has committed a serious offense, one of the seven ""deadly sins"" send-off offenses, and must leave the vicinity of the field of play immediately (in professional matches, this most often means he heads to the change room).

, A referee who points at the goal with his arm pointed straight, parallel to the ground, is signaling for a goal kick. A referee who points at the corner flag with his arm pointed upward is signaling for a corner kick.

, There are no official signals for a goal. A referee may point at the center circle with his arm pointed down however, it is a taken that when the ball has completely crossed the goal line between the goalposts, a goal has been scored (unless of course there has been an infraction of the LOTG in which case the referee will blow his whistle to indicate such and give an appropriate signal as to what the restart will be). The whistle is usually blown to signal a goal, because the whistle is used to start and stop play. However, when a goal is scored, play may automatically stop, so sometimes a whistle is not used.

Always be courteous and have a good attitude.",How to Be a Better Soccer Player," Some players have more natural talent than others. But everyone needs to practice efficiently and train properly to become better at soccer. Set a detailed schedule for practicing that you can follow. Plan out what you will work on before you practice. If your practice is unorganized and you just shoot the ball around or pass and dribble you won’t improve. Think about what specifically you need to improve.
Set a dedicated time for training. You might allow yourself one hour every day to train. During that hour block out specific time to work on a specific skill. For example, you may decide to spend 20 minutes on ball control with your off foot.
Being specific and setting goals will allow you to advance at a faster pace than when you just play around.;
, Advanced dribbling and finesse shots are fun. But you will never be able to perform these advanced moves if you haven’t mastered the basics.


Messi wouldn’t be able to weave in and out of defenders with ease if he never mastered basic dribbling and passing. Ronaldo wouldn’t be able to curve the ball just under the crossbar if he never mastered proper shooting technique.
To be a better soccer player you have to first become a great player when it comes to the basics. The building blocks may not be as fun to learn or practice, but without these tools, you’ll never develop the ability to perform the advanced moves.
Practice simple passing, receiving, shooting, dribbling, etc. Many players never effectively master these basic skills and, therefore, don’t even know how to defend against the simplest attack. Once you can perform basic skills without even thinking, you’ll be ready to advance your training and skill. You’ll also be amazed at how many other players who skipped over the basics can’t keep up with you.

, Look at professional soccer players and you’ll notice the incredible shape these players are in. The shape these players is in isn’t solely due to practicing, playing, and running up and down a field. It’s due to strict diet and exercise that benefits the whole body. While your legs are doing a lot of work you need to exercise and train your whole body so that you can support your legs. Proper exercise will also help you prevent injury.
An elite soccer player will typically run 6-10 miles during a match. So you need to be able to run without getting winded. But, you will notice that much of your running is in shorter bursts and sprints. You won’t train for soccer the same way you would for a marathon. Instead of just running long distances, do interval training.
Do sprint workouts that get your body used to working hard for shorter periods of time. You may be able to run 10 miles at a steady pace, but during a game, find yourself winded after a few minutes of bursts and sprints. That’s because your body isn’t used to this kind of running.
You also need to strengthen your muscles. Lifting weights to build muscles in your legs, back, and abdominal region will benefit you and allow you to improve. Start with higher reps at lower weights to build lean muscle. Squats, deadlifts, and ab workouts are going to help you on the field. High-intensity interval training will help you with strength, endurance, and agility. This kind of training involves working your body hard for shorter periods of time, taking short rests, and then working another area of the body.
For example, to improve your explosive speed and endurance you may train in intervals for 17 minutes. Alternate between sprinting for 15 seconds and then walking for 45 seconds. This kind of training will help your body perform during a game without getting as fatigued. , Elite players may burn between 1500-3000 calories in a 90-minute game. That means that you not only need a proper diet to keep you energized for a game. You also need it to help your strength and endurance training as well.


You won’t become a better player if you don’t take care of your body and mind. A proper diet will allow you to stay energized, focused, and will reduce the risk of injury.
Some basic tips for a soccer player diet include eating the least processed foods you can get. Such foods as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and high-fiber carbohydrates will provide you with proper nutrients to stay in great shape.
Eat fruits and vegetables that are colorful. Foods with natural colors provide plenty of nutrients. Lean proteins like fish, chicken, and even a little pork will build lean muscle. Healthy fats in olive oil, nuts, fish, and avocados are great for restoring your body after intense activity. Additionally, eating breakfast and smaller meals throughout the day will get your metabolism going and keep you energized and focused. After training or working out eat a post-workout recovery meal full of healthy carbs and protein.
After a match or intense workout, eat a healthy post-game meal to ensure your body recovers properly. Try eating three cups of whole grain pasta with one cup of tomato sauce with mushrooms. You can also add a bit of parmesan cheese for flavor. Greek yogurt with strawberries or other fruits can be a great dessert too. Stay hydrated. All that running around and training makes you sweat a lot. The more dehydrated you are, the worse you perform. Drink plenty of water. Finally, get enough rest. Your mind and body need time to relax and recover. If you aren’t getting an average of eight hours a night, your body won’t regenerate and perform as well.

, Often at lower levels players will clump together and not play the correct positions. But if you want to be a better player you will have to learn how to best play in your assigned position. Learn the roles of your position, where your imaginary limits are on the field. For example, if you are a right forward, your zone is the right side of the attacking third. You need to stay in this area of the field so that you can receive passes and loose balls. When you are on offense you will be responsible for using your position to advance the ball and possibly score. On defense, you will fall back to the center circle or near the center line.

, Having a great sense of where the action is happening on the field and where the ball will go next is a necessary skill.


When playing and practicing you should learn to not only know where each player is but also the most likely path of the ball. Even when you’re not close to it.
When you don’t have the ball you still need to be active. Don’t just watch the game as if you were a spectator. Practice predicting what kind of passes will happen, which players will get the ball next, and how those players will move into a new position.
Being able to predict the next action and placement of the ball and players will give you a great vision of the game. It will allow you to position yourself in the right spot to get the ball, block an attacker, and support. Being a great soccer player isn’t only about scoring goals. It’s about being ready at all times to help your team.

, Supporting your teammates means more than just giving encouragement. You need to physically support your team as well. As you progress you will discover that you excel at certain skills more than others. Recognize where you’re most valuable and use your skills to help the team, not yourself.
If you are skilled at dribbling and moving the ball up the field but lack shooting ability, you can easily support your team. You’ll best support your team by getting the ball near the goal and passing it to a striker.
Talk to your teammates on and off the field to build a rapport. During a game, you should be helping your teammates by giving encouragement as well as alerting players to open passes or shots, even if you aren’t sending the ball to yourself. Call for the ball loudly and use your hands to signal. Don’t hog the ball. Your teammates won’t pass you the ball if you never pass it back. Your teammates also won't give you the ball if you always miss a shot or lose it on a run. Remember that you’re not a star and can’t win alone. Make smart passes and learn to get rid of the ball when you need to. If you don't hog the ball, and instead to learn to pass, you'll probably end up getting it back more often.

, Depending on your level you may play many positions or just a few. But you should be able to play effectively anywhere. Knowing what to do in any position will inform you how the game works and help you in your primary position.


You need to be able to react quickly and switch your mindset during a game. For example, if you’re an attacker and loose the ball, you become the first defender. Your job is now to defend and get the ball back.
Playing any role goes beyond your position. You will also have to be a leader, supporter, cheerleader, and coach during your matches. Sometimes your role will be to cheer on your team as the ball advances toward the opponent’s goal. Other times it will be your job to dictate a set of moves and guide the players and ball into the best positions to advance.

, Watching soccer matches is a great way to get better. It’s like studying for a school test. You need to learn how the game works on the whole so that when on the field you know what to do.


Watch how the players move and take notes. Notice how professionals don’t always drive the ball forward toward the opponent’s goal but take time passing the ball. Oftentimes the players will pass the ball laterally and backward to find an open player before advancing.
Pay attention to how the players move around one another and where the imaginary boundaries for each position are. If you watch closely enough you’ll start to see passing and moving patterns.
A lot of times players move in a triangle formation, passing the ball as a unit back and forth. When the ball gets to an area near the goal, players on the wings typically cross the ball to the center for a header. Take notes on how the players get into scoring positions. , Most likely you have one dominant foot that you pass and shoot with. But to advance your skill you’ll need to be able to handle the ball with both. Being able to handle the ball with both feet will greatly open up your ability to pass, move, and score. A lot of players are right-footed, being able to use your opposite foot well will throw off the opponent.
You may also find yourself in a position where using your off foot is the only way to keep the ball, pass, or even shoot and score. Being comfortable with both feet will give you confidence and allow you to succeed in any situation.

, Soccer is not unlike a game of chess. Pieces move across the board in several different ways. Always be thinking three steps ahead.


When you watch matches notice the patterns in movements and formations. Learn the different kinds of formations and know which one your coach typically puts your team in.
Being able to predict next moves is important for field vision and being a great player. If you see that your teammate is going to need to pass the ball, you can get into position to receive it. At the same time knowing where you can then pass the ball will help you be a great team player.
Watch for the patterns and put yourself in the right position. For example, if you see a player moving the ball up and near a corner you know that the player will most likely cross the ball to the center. If you’re a forward, it’s your job to be there when the ball is passed.

, Passing effectively is the best way to move the ball forward. But passing forward isn’t always the best way to get closer to your opponent’s goal. Additionally, when done correctly, finesse moves will allow you to beat your opponent and press on.


Lean the different kinds of passes and when to use each one. You’ll also need to learn how to effectively receive each type of pass.
Run drills where you practice passing and receiving. Pay attention to your foot placement and which parts of your foot touch the ball. As a general rule, you should pass and receive with the inside of your foot, not with your toes. The inside gives you greater control.
Learn to use the correct passes to achieve the best result. You may do a short pass to make your teammate rush to the ball to create space. Or, you’ll need to do a long through ball so your teammate who is running forward can meet the ball without stopping.
Finesse moves are fun but hard to pull off. However, learning a few once you’ve gotten good at dribbling and passing can put you leagues ahead of other players. You have to learn to sell the move. You’re not only moving your feet, but you have to use your body to trick the defender as well. Practice cutting and chopping while keeping your body up and square so as not to give away your move. , Playing against people that are more skilled than you will make you work harder to win. You’ll also be able to see how moves, passing, shooting, etc., are done correctly.


If you’re only playing against people at your skill level or a lower skill, you’ll have a hard time progressing and getting better. When you play against superior players you won’t have any opportunity to get lazy.
Better opponents will also be able to show you how to achieve the results you want. Treat better players like a teacher or coach and use the opportunity to learn.

, Being a great team player is not only the right way to be, but it will make you valuable to the team.


Even if you’re losing, always be encouraging and supportive. Don’t check out just because you think the game is over. Offer support and keep trying until the actual end of the game. Be a courteous loser and a graceful winner.
The more support you offer on and off the field the more people will want you around. If you’re not the best player but always do your best and offer support you’ll have more opportunity to play and practice.
Lastly, have fun! Don’t get too caught up on winning. Soccer should be a fun sport. You play because you love the game. So remember that you’re supposed to be having fun. And that even if you lose, you are still getting better because you paid attention and learned from the game.

Check for offside only on the opposing half of the field.,
Compare the player's position to the ball.,
Look at the two defenders closest to their goal.,
Only check for offside at the instant a teammate touches the ball.,
Expect a penalty only if the offside player interferes with the area of play.,
Watch the referee.,
Understand the penalty.",How to Understand Offside in Soccer (Football)1," A player can only be offside if they are on the side of the field that contains the opposing team's goal. The purpose behind the offside penalty is to prevent attackers from waiting too close to the goal.If you are on the opposing half of the field, and if any part of your head, torso, or legs are over the line, you will be judged offside. Arms and hands do not count.;
, A player can only be in an offside position if they are between the ball and the opposing goal.

, The attacker is ""onside"" as long as there are at least two defenders level with him or in front of him. If there are one or zero defenders between the attacker and the goal, and the attacker also meets the two conditions above, he is in an offside position.The goalkeeper is usually one of the two defenders closest to the goal, but any two defenders count.

, There is no penalty just for being in an offside position. The referee checks an attacker's position only when one of their teammates touches the ball. As soon as an attacker releases a pass, the offside and onside status of each teammate ""freezes."" Each player will remain officially offside or onside no matter where they move. This only changes when the ball touches another teammate (causing offside to be ""calculated"" again), or when an opponent makes a deliberate play with the ball (removing all offside statuses).


This is why you often see attackers sprint past defenders as soon as the ball is played. Even if someone is past the defender when she receives the ball, she is still considered onside if she was behind the defenders when the ball was released.

, A referee can only penalize a player for being offside if he interferes with the play or tries to gain an advantage from being offside. A player can be penalized for this at any point until the opposing team takes control of the ball. Here are a few examples of situations where a referee would call an offside penalty:Teammate passes to an offside player.
Teammate kicks the ball, it bounces off a defender, and reaches an offside player.
Offside player gets in the way of a defender trying to reach the ball.
Teammate shoots at goal, offside player places himself near the goal hoping to get the rebound.

, If you're spectating a game and think a possible offside penalty is coming, watch the assistant referee (AR). If he spots an offside player interfering with play, the AR will raise his flag straight in the air. The referee may then blow the whistle to stop play, and raise his arm to indicate that an indirect free kick is awarded to the defending team. If the referee does not do this, he disagrees with the AR and has decided to overrule him.


If the referee blows the whistle, the AR will lower his flag by a certain amount to signal which player was offside. He will lower it by 45º for a player across the field from the AR, 90º for a player near the center, and 135º for a player on the near side., An offside penalty awards an indirect free kick to the opposing team. This kick takes place where the penalty occurs, and the team that received the penalty must stay at least 10 yards (9.15 m) back until the ball has been kicked.If the penalty occurred inside the penalty area, the attackers must remain outside the penalty area until the ball has left it.
If the penalty occurred inside the goal area, the defenders may take the free kick from anywhere inside the goal area.

You have to know what position you want to be.",How to Train to Be a Professional Football Player1," Each position requires a different amount of skill and strength. If you're unsure, below are some common things that you will want to know about popular positions.

Goalkeepers need to be able to move around freely and catch very well. They need to dive and take risks, have very quick reactions and be very reliable. They are the last line of defense when everything else fails, so they need to be cool under pressure too.



 


Defenders try to stop the other team from getting into their third. Defenders need to be very quick so they can keep up with fast strikers and need to exhibit good stamina. It helps if the defenders are tall so they can clear crosses and prevent scoring opportunities. Also, defenders need to be very strong so they can stop the charging opposition.






Midfielders carry the ball forward. They will need to be very fast and have good passing skills. Also, they will need to be strong so they won't get pulled down by the opposition. Sometimes, midfielders get a chance on goal, so good shooting skills are a benefit.






The strikers wrap everything up by (hopefully) scoring an awesome goal at the other end of the pitch. They need to be quick so they can lose their markers, they need to be strong to stay on their feet and they also need to have very good shooting and heading skills.

Know the situations where an offside penalty is impossible.,
Understand offside resets.,
Take into account defenders who have run off the field.,
Consider offside players interfering from afar.",How to Understand Offside in Soccer (Football)2," A player cannot receive an offside penalty for receiving the ball directly from a throw-in, a corner kick, or a goal kick.In these situations the ball has left play and reset all offside statuses.

, When the defending team takes control of the ball, the offside status of the attackers gets reset. Any attackers who were offside for the last play are now free to interfere with the play without penalty. However, there are some edge cases where it may be unclear whether this has happened. The ref always makes the final call, but these are the general guidelines:If a defender accidentally deflects the ball or it rebounds off her, there is no offside reset. This includes an instinctive reaction to deflect the ball, although this can be a tough ref call.
If the defender makes a save to prevent a goal, there is no offside reset. (This prevents offside players from gaining an advantage by waiting at the goal.)
The defender must gain control of the ball before the offside player can interfere. (This can be subjective, but the offside player is usually safe if approaching from some distance away.)

, If a defender runs off the edge of the field due to his own momentum, he still counts as a defender when working out onside and offside positions., An offside player who does not approach the ball can still receive a penalty if she blocks the vision of a defender in a way that impairs her play. Since a rules tweak in 2013, this is the only way an offside player can receive a penalty without coming into contact with a defender or the ball. Gestures and shouting do not violate offside rules, though they may receive a penalty for unsporting conduct."
"
Learn the rules.,
Watch a lot of games.",How to Train to Be a Professional Football Player2," The rules of football are fairly simple. The only one that is difficult to grasp is the offside rule. Otherwise, the rules are very basic. Here's a quick list of them:

You can't touch the ball with your hands. That's a handball.






If you commit a handball in your own penalty box, you will give away a penalty to the other team. If the handball was on purpose, you can even get sent off.


No reckless tackles. That's a foul.






If you commit a foul outside of your own penalty box, you will give away a free kick.
If you commit a foul inside of your own penalty box, you will give away a penalty kick.
If the foul wasn't too bad but was notable, you may receive a yellow card. Think of it as a strict warning. Two yellow cards means you get a red card.
If the foul was very dangerous, you may receive a red card. Even with just one red card, you will be sent off of the pitch and not be allowed back on until the end of the game. The same rule applies if you get two yellow cards.


You must take a throw in with both feet on the ground and both hands above your head.

, If you have a channel like ESPN or Sky Sports on your television, take full advantage of it. Don't only watch your favourite team play, watch lower and higher leagues play too. This will allow you to notice what the better team did that the lower team didn't do and how it affected the game. For example, one team might have passed really well, leading to a lot of scoring opportunities, leading to a lot of goals. Try to incorporate these kind of tactics into your games. Make sure you take note of every position, but especially the one you hope to become proficient in.

Train daily.,
Run.",How to Train to Be a Professional Football Player3," You will need to be very dedicated if you've set your sights on turning professional. This means keeping fit, eating the right foods and always getting enough sleep. You must train daily but be sure not to train too hard and tear a muscle as this can set you back far. When you feel your muscles starting to burn, do some stretches and take a break. Whatever position you play, you need to stretch your muscles, arms and legs a lot. Here are some stretches.

, Find a route in your local area. This could be a park that you can run through/around or just a few streets/blocks near your house. Where you go doesn't quite matter but be sure to run everyday and try to run faster and further each day. The key to football is small bursts of speed. To practice this, jog for a few meters and then sprint for the same amount of time. Go back to jogging and then sprinting, etc. Try not to stop.

It will also give you a chance to interact with other footballers, coaches and teams. Sharing your tips to playing better or running faster never hurts, and someone might even share theirs with you. When you play in a club or team, your chances of getting noticed and scouted by a team are much higher.

Understand what a penalty kick is.,
Practice focusing and self-composure techniques as part of your regular training.,
Know your penalty kick strengths.,
Understand how the goalkeeper is probably viewing your tactics.,
Take position and work out your tactics while the referee is placing the ball for the kick.,
Focus on where you want the ball to head in your mind's eye, not using your eyes.,
Kick the ball once the referee has signaled by whistling that it's time to kick.,
Stay alert.",How to Take a Penalty Kick in Soccer (Football)," While penalty kicks and kicks from the penalty mark are similar in nature, they are distinct and follow their own rules as part of the game. (Either way, the remainder of this article applies to both types of goal scoring, as the strategies and tactics suggested can be applied in both cases.)


A penalty kick occurs during the game. A penalty kick proceeds following Penalty Kick Law 14. It is a type of free kick that takes place 12 yards (11.0 m) / 11 meters out from the goal, and only the goalkeeper of the defending team is between the penalty taker and the goal.Kicks from the penalty mark occur at the end of a game during a tournament. This is not considered a penalty kick but a method to determine which team proceeds to the next stage of a particular tournament. It takes place only at the end of a game where the game finishes in a draw. While the procedure is similar to the penalty kick, kicks from the penalty mark do not follow the Penalty Kick Law 14 but is outlined in supplementary sections to the Laws.The penalty shootout is popularly referred to as ""penalties"".;
, Even before you are in the position of having to take a penalty goal, part of your training should always be to learn the techniques for keeping yourself calm under pressure.


Learn how to remain focused.
Practice staying calm under pressure, not thinking about the things that could go wrong. Practicing daily mindfulness can help you to stay aware and attentive to the present moment without being volatile or emotionally upset.Practice visualization of positive results.

, Before you are placed in the position of taking a penalty kick, it is important to have spent a lot of time training for this. Know in advance what your best shooting strategies are and practice them. When under pressure, returning to what you know well is always easier and if you've already practiced penalty kicks as part of your training, it will feel like second nature when you're doing the real thing.

, The keeper learns to read the striker's movements as a key part of his or her success in preventing goals. As part of this,


The goalkeeper already knows your playing style and will know how you shoot penalty kicks from previous games. Yet, the keeper will still need to read you in the moments before the shot. This means taking care with where you place your eyes and feet because the keeper will be watching very carefully for all signals.
If the keeper comes up to talk to you pre-shot, give away nothing. Keep in mind that the the keeper is trying to distract you.
Avoid watching the keeper doing anything distracting -- it is a deliberate tactic aimed at unsettling you, such as the ""wobbly dance"" performed by Bruce Grobbelaar European Cup in 1984.Don't bother trying to throw off the keeper by staring in the opposite direction from which you intend to kick the ball. A good keeper is wise to that trick and it won't succeed if that's your only strategy.
Realize that the keeper is checking your feet angles for any signs that give away your intended shot. Chris Jones says that sharp approach angles give away the ball direction and that sharp angle for a right-footed player means a shoot to the keeper's right (player's left, across his body), while a straighter run means that the right-footed player is shooting to his right.

, The important thing is to take the penalty shot in the way that fits best with your abilities, as well as balancing this with a little ""sports science"" knowledge. Consider as quickly as you can which of the following approaches will work best for you at this point in the game:


Shoot with speed. The speed of making a penalty shot has been researched and it appears that a shot taken quickly and with good strength allows you to take advantage of the element of surprise. If you can get yourself together quickly and make a good, fast shot within 3 seconds after the whistle is blown, this can be a successful tactic.Delay the shoot. On the other hand, if you'd rather psych out the keeper, time can be on your side. A delay of more than 13 seconds can unsettle the keeper.Wait for the keeper to move. However, you must be ready to react swiftly once the keeper has moved, or your moment for surprise will be lost.
Approach the ball with a ""stutter"" (paradinha). This is a ""feinting"" move in which you aim to confuse the keeper by making a stutter step as you run up to take the kick. Great care must be taken in doing this, however, as you must not be viewed as feinting to kick the ball once the run-up has been completed, or this will earn you a caution., As explained earlier, the keeper is watching your eyes and the more nervous you are, the more likely you are to slip into focusing on the net direction and the keeper than on the ball. To avoid this, the following tips can help:


Choose the spot where you want to aim the ball before approaching the ball.Avoid looking at the keeper. If it's easier, pretend the keeper is not present.

Stay focused on the ball. Keep your eyes on the ball at all times and remain focused -- once focus is lost, you risk losing your composure.

, Decide first whether you will kick for accuracy or for power (this determines your kick style) and then take the kick as recommended below:



Accuracy - If it's ""precision over power"" you want, then the recommended kick is the inside-foot.







Power - Sometimes power can be enough to take the ball past the keeper: a strong shooter who can kick at speeds of 80 mph (~130 km/h) can shoot the ball to the goal line in 500 milliseconds, whereas the keeper will take 600 milliseconds to move from the center of the goal to one of its posts.To achieve this shot, shoot hard with the instep, i.e., from the laces.






Take a short, straight run up of only four to six steps (this has been found to be the most successful approach). Kick the ball low and hard, and aim for about 3 inches / 7.5 cm inside of each post: Chris Jones says that the low and hard shot taken from a short, straight run is ""impossible to stop"".







, As soon as you strike the ball, do not switch off. Always get ready for a rebound if the keeper saves it, but not if the ball hits the post/crossbar. Remember always take your time.

Practice dribbling and scoring. (Going to an empty field to practice dribbling and scoring is a good idea). However, there is only so much you can do on your own. Ideally, it is best to have a partner or, even better, partners to practice with. Then, you can mimic game time situations and moments, and practice movement with a ball and with other players.
Find a good brick wall, draw a circle on it, and practice scoring into that circle. Practice both feet, because it isn't relevant to be only right or left-footed.;
, If you can’t run a series of sprints without feeling completely out of breath, you need to work on your speed and endurance. Practice doing 8-10 100 yard sprints in a row, at least 3 times a week, in the month before your tryout.


Squatting also helps speed. The overhead squat is a time-tested exercise requiring full-body range of motion. It takes some practice to get it right, but there is no better exercise to encourage maximal gluteal and hamstring activation. You also end up gaining strength and neuromuscular power you could never hope to achieve on a squat machine or with a typical half-depth standing squat. Just try to this with a partner to help analyze your form, if possible.
Stand with heels as wide as shoulders, toes pointing slightly out, and arms overhead, elbows locked. Squat down as low as you can, encouraging gluteal contraction, and keeping your back as straight as possible. Hold this position as long as you can. As you continue to do this exercise, you will be able to do it longer.

, This skill is crucial to learn and requires a lot of practice.

,, It is important to be healthy out on the field. Also, Eating well will indeed increase your stamina.

, It's necessary to be active in soccer, due to the transitions and moving you have to do.

, This means understand your position and prepare to play soccer.

, If you are trying to play in an older league, make sure that the team fits your need for a challenge. If you want to play for a select team, but you are still looking to have fun more than anything else, you will want to be sure you agree with the philosophy of your coaches.

, In other words, make sure you agree with the coach's way of teaching the game. Understand what your coach is trying to tell you. Understand that your coach is looking for soccer skills, not personality.


Respect what your coach says or tells you to do. Make sure you respect your coach, but have enough will-power to decline if your coach wants you to do something that doesn't reach the rules of the game.

, Play the game and pass the ball to other players. Do not hog the ball to yourself expecting to get to the goal in time. Pass the ball. This develops team work and help your team mates want to gain your trust.


Practice passing the soccer ball and get good in your soccer skills.

, If someone has fallen, help them up and play fair.

, Most coaches want to see how well you react to situations and how well you can use the environment or space to your advantage.

, When people work together, honest mistakes and disappointments happen, and it's easy to blame someone who causes these. However, when everyone starts pointing fingers, an unpleasant atmosphere can quickly develop. This lowers morale, undermines trust, and is ultimately unproductive. Instead, encourage everyone in your group to think about the mistake in a constructive way. What can you all do to fix what happened, and move forward together? And how can you make sure that this mistake doesn't happen again?

If you want to keep the ball in your team's possession, you're going to need to dribble well. Dribbling is all about touching the ball strong enough to carry it forward, but light enough so that it stays by your side — and away from opponents.


You can dribble with the inside of your shoe, above the toe (with the foot pointed down toward the ground), and even with the outside of the shoe. Most coaches would tell players to dribble with their foot pointed down and turned in with the ball touching your pinky toe. The safest way to dribble for beginners is probably with the inside of your shoe, but in different situations, you'll have to use different parts of the shoe.
Learn to dribble at different speeds. When you're running down the sideline and you've beaten your man, your dribbling will look a lot different from when you're taking on a defender head on.

When you're dribbling slower, you usually keep the ball close to your side at all times. This way a defender is forced to make a move to take the ball away.
When you're dribbling faster, you can sometimes kick the ball further away and run to the ball. This is usually if you've already beaten your enemy. You do this because most players can run quicker off the ball than they can dribbling it.
You should touch the ball about once every step you take to keep it under control.

;
, Passing is all about putting the ball exactly where you want it. In order to pass a soccer ball, kick the ball using the inside of your foot. This will give you less power but more accuracy. Once you master the basic pass, you can then try to slice and hook the ball in order to pass it to one of your teammates.


Pay attention to where your planter foot is placed. Your planter foot should be right next to the ball. While the planter foot is near the ball, point the foot in the direction you would like the ball to go to.
Pass with your toes pointed upward and your heel on the ground.
Anticipate where a player is going to be. Because you're often going to be passing on the fly, kicking the ball to an open space where you want your teammate to be is essential. If your teammate is running, always kick the ball ahead of them so that they can run to the ball.

, If you're really close to the goal and all you need is accuracy, you can shoot using the sweet spot of the inside of your shoe, like a pass, but usually, you're going to be farther away and will need power as well as accuracy,of course.


Set your planter foot and aim the toe of the planter foot to where you want the shot to travel and always have a slight look at the target before you shoot.
You don't have to get much of a running start, but you do want to bring your foot back, bending it as you do in order to get more power.
Hit the ball on the middle laces of your shoe, with your foot pointed down at the ground. Keep your foot pointed down at the ground as you follow through.
Use your hips to swing through the ball. Bring your foot across your body if necessary to generate even more power. This should cause both feet to lift from the ground.

, Some estimates say that professional soccer players run 6 to 8 miles (9.7 to 12.9 km) during a 90 minute game.That's a lot of running. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that a lot of the running you'll be doing is when you don't have the ball. Learn how to get into open space, how to run to where to your teammate expects or wants you to be, and how to run past a defender who's guarding you.

, Defending the goal is an underrated achievement. It can be extremely difficult staying on your man or getting the ball away from your man. There are three basic things that you need to remember when guarding a player in soccer:


Don't be fooled by feints, tricks, or jukes: keep your eye on the ball. A good soccer player will try to juke or feint with their body in order to get past you. They're hoping that what they do with their body will distract you from what they're going to do with the ball. Don't let this happen. Keep your eyes on the ball at all times, not on the player.
Stay in between the ball and the goal. In other words, don't let the ball get behind you. This is harder than it sounds. It's a delicate balance keeping enough pressure on the ball and giving the person who's attacking enough space so that they don't get behind you.
Learn to anticipate the dribble. Right after an attacker hits the ball on the dribble — that's the time when try to hit the ball away. This is called anticipating the dribble, and it's essential for knocking the ball from an attacking player. Just be sure not to lunge and miss; you're vulnerable when you do this!

, Try hitting the ball with your head right where your hair meets your forehead. Do not use the top of your head! When getting ready to head the ball, don't lift your head back; move your upper torso back instead. This will give you more power and won't strain your neck as much. You have to hit the ball, not let the ball hit you.

, Juggling is very hard to master but an important part of the game. Truth be told, you won't need to juggle very often in a game, but knowing how to juggle does several things:


It helps you control a ball that's coming at you from the air. Not all passes are on the ground. The ones that aren't will need to be intercepted and controlled by some form of juggling.
Juggling helps improve your touch on the ball. If you know how to juggle your touch on the ball becomes a lot more sensitive. Your first touch on the ball is extremely important in soccer.
Juggling will help you use both feet better. Learning how to juggle is an exercise is using your non-dominant foot better. The best soccer players in the world can use both feet as dominant feet.

, It's really important to be able to dribble, pass, and shoot the ball with your non-dominant foot. Good defenders will take away your dominant foot and force you to play with your non-dominant foot. If you can't use your non-dominant foot, you'll be playing with a handicap.


Practice only using your non-dominant foot during practice or when you shoot or juggle by yourself. Accustoming your body to the muscle memory is an important part of being fluent in your non-dominant foot.

, You want to be able to send corner kicks right in the middle of the penalty area, usually up in the air so that a teammate can head the ball in. Free kicks can either be taken quickly and simply passes to a nearby teammate, or you can organize a ""set play"" where you kick the ball in a certain area while your teammates execute a play.

, Try to develop your own playing style, one that suits you. Are you a tricky player who relies on juking out other players? Are you fast enough to beat everyone with sheer speed? Are you great at using your body and power to blast goals? Are you expert at keeping opponents from getting off shots? Find out what kind of player you are, set goals for yourself on how you can become a more rounded player, and remember to have fun. Soccer isn't the most popular sport in the world for no reason.

, The object of the game is to score more goals than the opponent scores. A goal is scored when the whole ball passes the goal line. It must go right behind it with it's all area. Goalies in their own penalty area are the only players on the pitch who can use their arms. All other players may use any part of their bodies except their hands.

, There are 11 total players on the pitch to start the game. Although the positions can be rearranged however the coach sees fit, there is usually one goalie, four defenders, four midfielders, and two strikers.


Goalie: this person protects the net and is the only one on the field who can use their hands in the penalty area. The goalie has to be flexible, quick to anticipate, and good at communication.
Defenders. Defenders usually stay behind the half-way line in an effort to help prevent goal from being scored against them. They make good outlet passes and are usually bigger physically than other players.
Midfielders. Midfielders do the most running, as they play a combination of defense and offense They usually orchestrate the attack. They're exceptionally good at holding onto the ball and passing.
Forwards/strikers. These are the ones who get the most cracks at shooting the ball. They need to be quick, agile, and able to shoot a stunning shot. They also need to be excellent headers.

, One team starts the game by kicking off. The opposite team gets to kick off after halftime. At the time of kickoff, each team's players need to be entirely on their half of play. Once the whistle has blown and the ball is kicked, the players can move freely into both halves of play, provided they are not offside.

, Offside is one of the more crucial rules in soccer, and it's designed to keep soccer players from cherry-picking, or bunching a lot of their players near the opponent's goal at all times.


A player is offside when s/he is:

Ahead of the ball, as well as
In the opponent's half, as well as
Behind the last defender when the ball is passed to him by one of his teammates


Offsides is negated on:

Throw-ins
Corner kicks
Goal kicks



, Throw-ins happen when the ball fully travels outside the area of play. Possession goes to the team who wasn't the last to touch it. This team gets to throw the ball in from the place where it went out of bounds.


A player throwing can get a running start, but must generally stop near the area where the ball went out of bounds.
A player must bring the ball up with both hands behind his or her head and release the ball over his head with both hands.
A player cannot lift his or her feet off the ground while they are throwing the ball. Both feet must stay on the ground.

, A referee issues a yellow card as a warning to a player. Two yellow cards result in a red card, after which that player must leave the game permanently. Reasons for yellow cards include:


Dangerous play. High kicking near a player’s head, for example.
Illegal obstruction. This happens when a player intentionally takes a position between and an opponent when that player isn't within playing distance of the ball.
Charging the goalkeeper in the goal area.
Goalkeeper playing the ball with his hands when the ball is kicked by a teammate.
Goalkeeper Infringements. Unsafe play such as charging the goalie.
Goalkeeper taking more than four steps while controlling the ball.
Intentionally wasting time at the end of a game.

, A red card can be given out before a yellow card if especially dangerous play is involved, although a red card usually results from two yellow cards. Reasons for red cards include:


Kicking a player intentionally.
Jumping up at a player and making contact.
Charging a player in a rough way, especially if hands are involved.
Charging a player from behind.
Tripping a player.
Hitting, pushing, holding, or spitting at a player.
Handling the ball by a non-goalie.

, A direct free kick is when you can kick the ball directly into the goal for a score without the ball touching another teammate first. An indirect free kick must be touched by another teammate before counting as a score.

, A penalty kick happens when a defender fouls an opponent in his or her own penalty box. All other players except the goalie and the player taking the penalty kick line up outside the penalty area. The goalie must stand on the goal line and cannot move off of it before the ball is struck. The ball is placed on a designated area called the penalty spot. After the ball is hit, it is live, meaning that if it ricochets off the goalie or post, it can be played by either team.

, If the ball goes over the goal line (but not into the goal) and was last touched by the defending team, the ball goes to the closest goal line corner and becomes a corner kick, with possession going to the attacking team. If the ball goes over the goal line (but not into the goal) and was last touched by the attacking team, the ball goes to the edge of the 6-yard box and becomes a goal kick, with possession going to the defending team. The goalie usually takes a goal kick.

You're the one doing the kick, so you should be the one to place the ball on the penalty marker. Run your hand through the grass to get any clumps, rocks, or sticks out of the way, then place the ball as high up on the grass as possible.


Ideally, the ball should be fluffed slightly on the grass to give yourself the best chance of striking it clean. If the spot is worn down, don't worry too much. Kicking it along the ground is a high-probability shot, anyway. Just make sure you account for the ball's height in your approach.;
, Plant the ball, then step backward three steps, and take one step to the side of your non-kicking foot. You don't have far to kick the ball, and most players only need one approaching step and one plant step to get enough power behind the ball to score a penalty. More than that is usually unnecessary, but do what feels comfortable. Practice different approaches and find out what works best for you.


Some players think taking a running start from mid-field will give you more power in your shot. While that may look intimidating, the truth of it is that you'll have to slow down as you approach the ball, to make sure you don't end up planting on the wrong foot. Taking fifty steps to shoot a penalty kick accomplishes nothing but tiring you out.

, Don't look at the keeper, listen to your opponents chattering, or pay attention to what anyone is saying. Silence the field, look at the ball, and think about what you're doing. Nothing else matters right now but putting the ball in the back of the net. The keeper will probably be jumping around, waving arms, and acting confident. This is because the keeper knows you're about to score. Stay focused and stay calm, and you'll be that much closer to a goal.


Alternatively, if you're feeling alpha, stare the keeper down for all you're worth. Burn a hole through the back of the net with your eyes. Intimidate your opponent.
Statistically, more penalty are missed than are saved. Your biggest opponent in the penalty kick is not the goalkeeper, but yourself. Remember that.

, The best place to shoot a penalty kick? Wherever feels most comfortable for you. Penalty kicks are a high-probability shot anywhere on the net, but thinking too hard causes a lot of players to get in their own way, and change their decision at the last minute. You're not going to see anything in the split second before you kick that will help you change your mind. Pick a spot and be confident that it's correct. Remember this golden rule, ""The spot once chosen for placing the kick must never be changed. No second thoughts.""


Statistically, it's true that most penalty kicks are scored in the bottom left corner of the net. The top left corner is the second-highest percentage, followed by the bottom right corner. This is because most players are right-footed, and hook the ball left naturally.When in doubt, keep the ball low. Shots aimed at the upper corners are the most seldom saved, but the most often missed. If you're a very accurate shooter, you give yourself the best chance with a shot aimed at the upper post, but statistically the chances of missing are much higher.

, When you've placed the ball and decided where you're shooting, just relax. Feel confident. More than 70 percent of penalty kicks end with goals. Focus on the task at hand, the mechanics of the shot, and wait for the referee's whistle. Tell yourself you're going to score.


Without staring at the spot where you're going to shoot, visualize the shot going past the goalie and into the net. Visualize yourself following through, striking the ball clean and hard, and scoring the goal for your team.
When you hear the referee's whistle, it's best to go as quickly as possible and not give yourself too much time to think about it and make a bad decision. You don't need to psych out the goalie any more. The time is now.

, Plant your non-kicking foot a few inches to the side of the ball and drive into it with the instep of your kicking leg. This offers you the best control over the ball, allowing you to drive it into the spot of your choice, and into the back of the net. Follow through with your kicking motion, driving your leg up and pointing your toe where you want the ball to go.


Some players like to use the laces, driving over the ball to put more power behind it, which is also a perfectly-fine way of kicking. This typically offers less accuracy, but more power.
If you want the ball to go high, plant your plant foot just behind the ball and lean over it to keep it down low enough to stay under the bar. You need to do this if you want to aim for the top corner.
If you want the ball to stay on the ground, use your instep and drive through the ball hard. Don't try to get too fancy with your aim. It doesn't need to skim off the post, it just needs to find net.

, If you should miss, be careful before you charge in and take another shot. Another player, whether it be an opponent or a teammate, needs to touch the ball before you do. If the goalkeeper makes a save, but the ball bounces free, run to it as fast as you can and try to get it in the net. If you drive the ball off the post, another player has to touch it first, or you'll be called for a foul.

, You should have no more than three options for shots any time you get up to the box to take a penalty kick in soccer. Don't make it more difficult on yourself than it needs to be. Practice taking three differently placed penalty kicks, and call that your repertoire of shots. Perfect each one of them, so you know you'll be able to score in any of the three places when the time comes and you make that decision. Wherever your most comfortable, highest-probability shots are, practice them and don't worry about any other choices.


Most goalies will dive left or right at random, making it very difficult to anticipate where the goalie will be when you shoot. Since it happens so quickly, you're playing a game of chance, always. If the goalie is familiar with your style of play, however, it's good to have a few go-to options in your bag at all times. Again, more shots are missed than saved, so it's mostly up to you.Most saves happen in the bottom right corner of the goal. Some goalies guess that right-footed kickers will try to outsmart them by going to the non-natural corner. It's best to go easy and uncomplicated the process. Shoot to the corner that feels best.

, Anyone can blast a ball into the back of the net a couple times, but what about when you've been going hard on the field for half an hour, fighting for balls, taking corner kicks. Your legs will be tired, you'll be sweaty and exhausted and all of a sudden all the eyes will be on you. Your legs might feel like lead, but you've got to come through with a brilliant goal that'll put your team ahead. Train the right way. Take penalty kicks when you're tired and learn to slow down and calm yourself, focusing on the mechanics and the motions to help yourself score.

, For some players, a two-step approach will be plenty to get the power they're looking for. Others might need a different amount of steps, or may want to play around with psyching out the goalkeeper with different approaches and fancy footwork. That's fine. Practice approaching your kicks from different steps back and see what feels the most comfortable for you.


Some players like to take a few more steps back to force a stutter-step, a few little quick strides before driving into the ball. This helps to throw the timing of the goalie off, and can force the keeper to jump early, meaning that you might be able to shoot into an open net.

, Again, easy to blast balls into an open net. Practice with a keeper who's trash talking. Practice while your little brother makes fun of you from behind, telling you that you're going to miss. Practice when there's loud music playing, bugs howling, and it's raining out. Practice in the worst conditions and you'll be prepared for anything.

, Time to get zen on the PK game. If you want to really take your penalty kick shooting to the next level, practice them with your eyes closed. Literally. The distance from the penalty spot to the goal and the dimensions of the goal will be identical every time you want to take a penalty kick. This means that your approach, your mechanics, and your shot-placement should be automatic. You should be able to do this with your eyes closed. Why not try it?

If you have a low budget use cost efficient sites like weaponblender.com, airsplat.com, or airsoftstation.com;
,
For budgets 50-90 dollars, I recommend gas pistols.,
For budgets around 90-100 dollars, you want a metal gearbox AEG (automatic electric gun).,
If you have a 100-125 dollar budget, you can start getting nicer, more durable, and harder shooting AEGs.,
If you have a 125-150 dollar budget, now you can have some fun.,
When using an AEG or a gas pistol, ALWAYS use the .20 gram bb's as opposed to the standard .12 gram.,
Remember to take the cost of bb's and shipping into account.",How to Airsoft on a Low Budget,", There are two types of gas pistols, blowbacks and non-blowbacks. A blowback pistol has its slide blowback, just like on a real gun, and therefore are cooler looking, but use up more gas. Non-blowbacks are more gas efficient and cheaper than blowbacks, but are usually lower in quality. A gas pistol can use green gas or CO2 cartridges. Green gas pistols are around 300 fps and are affected in cold weather, while CO2 pistols can get up to 400+ fps and aren't affected by cold weather, but are generally more expensive. Keep in mind that green gas costs around 11 bucks per container.

, The best gun for this price is probably the Well R8 G3 A3 on airsplat.com. Another good gun is the Galaxy G5K M5K, although it has been known to sometimes contain quality issues. If you don't like either of those guns, search Airsoftstation.com and Airsplat.com. They have a good selection of sub 100 dollar AEGs. Be careful though, make sure it has a metal gearbox and not a plastic one

, When it comes to good quality, durable gun you can never go wrong with CYMA's AK variants. If possible, get a AK without fake wood. The plastic they make for the fake would isn't very durable for some reason. I would personally recommend the CYMA cm.031 AK 74 on weaponblender.com. It is one of the best quality AK and also one of the cheapest. Stay away from any M4s, they may look cool, but at this price range, aren't good quality.

, In this range there's a lot of durable guns made by a variety of brands. The CYMAs AKs are still reliable. Another good, reliable brand is JG and their G36s. I'd say the best gun you can get in this range is the original JG G608 G36 on weaponblender.com. It has a nylon fiber body, making it really durable, while the foldable stock allows it to become compact and small, perfect for close combat while the 375 fps gives it nice range, and it has quality internals, all for just $135. You can start getting m4s in this range, but look at good review to see how good quality one is.

, They provide more density, which allows them to fly further and they also prevent damage to the gun's internals.

, A good 5000 round bag or box of .20 gram bbs costs about 12 dollars. Shipping prices are always only 5 dollars per order on weaponblender.com, and vary on airsplat.com and airsoftstation.com.

Create or join a Airsoft team.,
Make sure you have at least 4 people to be in your team/squad

Divide combat roles to people in your squad: Rifleman, Support gunner, Radioman or Designated Marksman (DM).,
Buy a support weapon like a M249 S.A.W., A&K M249 M240 Bravo, Krytac LMG or VFC M27 IAR...


Buy at least one box/drum magazine that can hold at least 500+ rounds.,Be your squads designated support gunner

,Support Gunner Tactics - The role of a support gunner is to provide covering fire and pin down target areas

,
Find a good area with lots of cover behind you.,
When you are instructed to lay down covering fire or fire upon the objective:


Use short controlled bursts around the enemy.,
When playing in a non-stationary position:


Stay in the middle of your squad, constantly looking for threats
Keep your gun up and ready when approaching and turning corners
If you can let your gun rest against a short wall or piece of cover—this gives your arms a rest and gives you some cover.",How to Be a Airsoft Support Gunner,"(This is not a necessity, but helps greatly.);
,
Great combos include:(4 player team) 3x Rifleman 1x support gunner, 4x snipers, 2x Rifleman 1x support and 1x Designated Marksman or 2x Rifleman and 2x support gunners.

, They will often hold up to 4,000
Buy an extra battery - you WILL need it. Valken batteries, Lipo batteries and Intellect batteries are great quality.

,,, Set up your weapon with a clear view of the enemy position or objective.


Buy and utilize a bipod..they can be lifesavers.
Do not be afraid to go prone (lie down) because it is harder for the OPFOR (opposing force) to see you with a low profile ( keep in mind this will make it harder to get up if in a hurry)

,
Try to hit the cover around the enemy that is very loud when hit: metal objects...
Remember that you are not necessarily trying to get one enemy, you are just trying to pin their entire team down... So you should not focus on one guy, try to fire on the objective as a whole
Fire off a burst to pin the enemy, then hold your fire, when you see him pop back out of cover, open fire again and pin him back down before he can hit your team.
As a support gunner it is your job to listen to your team, and find where they need cover fire
If you are ""stingy"" with ammo the support role is not for you, your job is to cover your squad mates movement and ammo will be your best friend.

,
Always be looking for easily defensible positions with lots of cover.

Buy goggles.,
Consider your options.,
Consider your own desires.,
Get gear.,
Okay, so now you've got your gun, your gear, and you're ready to play.",How to Airsoft Like a Pro," It doesn't matter how good your gun is when you don't have goggles. Many serious airsofters invest in ESS goggles, which the US ARMY uses. These goggles can cost up to $100 depending on what they come with. The basic model is generally $60. Popular alternatives include Bug-Eyez, which use a metal mesh instead of plastic polymer.


Mesh goggles do not fog; however in certain lighting conditions they can be very hard to see through. Lower quality bbs also break and the pieces can penetrate mesh. You can also use a paintball mask. Only use safety or shooting glasses for target shooting, as there is a gap between the eyes and the glasses where a BB could go in to and enter the eyes by deflection. These are available at any hardware or sporting goods store. They are lightweight and don't look much different from sunglasses, but are much safer.
Note: Many ""Army Surplus"" type stores sell (used) issue ESS goggles for reasonable prices. If ESS goggles are not available, another great alternative are the older-issue 'Sand, Wind & Dust' goggles.;
, It's not always possible to spend upwards of $1000 on the best gun ever. The majority of airsofters buy guns in the $200-$600 range. High-end companies such as Tokyo Marui and Classic Army make guns at this price. However, if your budget is tight, clone companies such as ECHO 1/ Jing Gong (JG) and A&K produce clones of high-end guns at reduced prices.

, Do you want to be more up close with your enemy, or would you rather sit back and take shots at your leisure? Many airsoft leagues disallow sniper rifles as many have an unreasonably high FPS (feet-per-second). Depending on your location, it might be smart to buy a CQB (close-quarters battle) gun. Nearly every major airsoft manufacturer makes CQB guns such as the M4A1 and the MP5. However, the choice is yours.

, While most fields do not require specific uniforms or equipment, you will find yourself a bit of a misfit with nothing but sneakers, jeans, and a t-shirt on most serious airsoft fields. For those on the cheap, surplus Woodland BDU's are available at many army surplus stores and online. If you are looking for something unique, consider foreign camouflage patterns. For those with a bigger budget, the Multicam Pattern is popular. One thing many airsofters forget is a good pair of boots. Military combat boots can be expensive, in the $100-$200 range, but a simple pair of water-proof boots from Walmart will do the trick. Yours truly wears a $40 pair of boots from Walmart. Depending on your choice in weaponry, you may want to invest in a chest rig or vest. Many websites such as CheaperThanDirt.com sell chest rigs inexpensively. Chest rigs allow you to buy pouches according to your needs and place them where they make you feel comfortable. Chest rigs can go anywhere from $20 to $100, however higher-end CIRAS vests can fetch prices of up to $700.

, Now what? If you already know of a local league or group in your area, great. If not, think about recruiting some of your friends. Whatever you do, do NOT play in backyards (Unless you get permission from the owner and make sure not to hit anything breakable like windows) or public areas. The risk of being spotted and arrested is too great, and will only damage the public reputation of Airsoft. Many leagues have private fields available for play.

Take precautions:
Anything you do to your gun is at your own risk, and you lose the shop warranty.,
Remove the two pins that keep the stock together with the rest of the gun, and carefully pull the stock from the rest of the gun.,

Select a ball that is size 5.,
Check the weight.,
Get the right material.",How to Select a Netball," This means that its circumference should measure between 69 centimeter (27.2 in) and 71cm (27"" and 28"").;
, The ideal weight is between 400 grams and 450 grams (14 ounces and 16 ounces).

, A netball should be made of leather or rubber. Other materials might be appropriate but check with your local regulations first and also ask the retailer about quality and durability.

Stand inside the shooting semicircle.,
Hold the netball with your dominant hand.,
Steady the ball with your other hand.,
Stretch your arms over your head.,
Have the goal net in your view.,
Bend your knees and elbows at the same time.,
Push up and release the ball.,
Keep practicing.,
Take longer shots.,
Shoot with a feeder in place.,
Shoot with a defender in place.",How to Shoot Accurately in Netball," According to netball rules, you can only shoot when you're inside this portion of the court, which includes the line that marks the circle. Align your body with the netball post, with your feet and hips shoulder distance apart and facing forward.Proper balance is key to an accurate netball shot, so be sure that your weight is distributed evenly between both feet.;
, Position it behind and under the ball, and use your fingertips to cradle it softly.For better control, ensure that the gap between your palm and the ball is minimal.Make sure that your fingers are relaxed as they hold the ball. If they're grasping too tight or are too straight, your shot may be off.

, Stabilizing it allows you to give the ball extra spin when you shoot.However, make sure that your second hand doesn't put too much pressure on the ball because it can throw off your shot.New or young netball players may want to use both hands to hold the ball in order to generate enough power to shoot, but keep in mind that it can actually increase the chance of shooting errors.
While it’s okay to start out shooting with two hands, practice using one hand. Using one hand to shoot and the other only to steady the ball ensures a more accurate shot.

, You want to hold the ball high for the most accurate shot, so your elbows are near your forehead and slightly flexed. Make sure that they're facing the netball post too., Imagine a cone above the net, like a witch's hat, and focus on the highest, most center point -- that's where you want to aim the ball. The best shots fall through without actually touching the ring, so you want to keep the ball as centered as possible.All of your focus should be on the hoop, so do your best to ignore distractions.
It may help to line the edge of the ball up with the edge of the hoop before you take your shot.

, While your arms and hands will determine what direction the ball goes in, the real power for your shot comes from the lower body. That means you have to prepare to push up through your ankles and knees.For the best form, keep your elbows at a right angle, while holding the ball steady. You should also keep your back straight and hold your head up high.

, To generate the most power for your shot, your arms and knees should straighten at the same time, while your dominant hand flicks the ball upwards. That helps create a backward spin that allows for a high ball trajectory as it soars toward the net, so it drops through without touching the ring.For the most accurate shot, you must release the ball when your arms are at full extension. Releasing early can throw your shot off.
In game action, put your hand up as soon as the ball is out of your hands. That way, if you don't get it in, you can have another try.

, It will take time to develop your skills, but shooting goals will get easier the more you try. Test how far you need to bend to create the most powerful shot, and then try to replicate the form each time that you take a shot.

, While you must be inside the shooting semicircle, it is a fairly large area, which means there are a variety of distances that you can shoot from. If you’re new to netball, you’ll probably begin practicing your shooting closer to the goal. As you become more comfortable, though, start increasing the distance of your shot. That way, you’ll be able to shoot from all over the semicircle with accuracy., During game action, you’ll have the ball passed to you before you take your shot. To become comfortable shooting in that situation, it helps to practice with another player feeding you the ball. You’ll learn to receive the ball and shoot it in one smooth motion.You should start outside the shooting semicircle, while the other player begins inside the semicircle with the ball.
The other player should feed you the ball from in front of you, so you can run into it to receive it.
Once you’ve received the ball, take the time to set up your shot properly. You don’t want to just rush through the shooting and possibly throw your shot off.
Practice running into the semicircle to receive the ball from various spots outside and at various speeds. You’ll never know exactly what situation will come up in game action.

, In a game, the other team’s defence will try to keep you from scoring a goal, which obviously makes it more difficult to shoot accurately. That’s why it helps to practice shooting with another player trying to defend you. You’ll get used to the distraction, and learn the best way to get around a defender.Start by standing opposite the hoop. The defending player should stand between you and it, with her arms raised over her head to effectively block your shot.
Try to shoot the ball over the defender’s arms and through the hoop. Remember to practice the right form as you avoid the defender, or your shot may not be as accurate as you’d like.

Position your body to shoot.,
Place the ball in your hands.,
Shoot the netball.,
Stand a little further back, bend your knees and jump then throw to perfect your technique from further away.,
Remember the BEEF acronym.",How to Shoot in Netball1," The proper stance is the foundation to your shooting technique. Keep your feet hip/shoulder width distance apart and relax your knees. Your hips, shoulders, and elbow should be facing forward. Your body should be aligned no matter where you are around the post.Stand close to the ring.









Have someone else watch you as you practice your stance. Another person can see any errors and help you make adjustments.
Practice your stance in different positions around the post. Make sure your feet are always pointed towards the post.;
, Hold the ball with your dominant/shooting hand and keep your fingers soft. Hold the ball as high as you can in both hands. Use your other hand for balance, but do not apply any pressure to the ball with this hand. Your fingers should be touching the ball, but leave a little bit of space between the palm of your hand and the ball.If you are a younger player or a new player, it may be easier to hold the ball with two hands. Holding with two hands will give you more power when you are shooting.
Once the ball is firmly in your hands, hold the ball high above your head. Your elbow should be by your forehead.
You should not be able to see the ball when it is above your head.

, Bend your elbows and your knees at the same time. Keep your elbow by your forehead and only move the top part of your arm. Straighten your elbow and your knees and then release the ball. Toss the ball up in an up-and-over motion toward the ring. Aim at the center point above the net as you shoot and flick your hand forward with your shooting arm.








It is important that you bend your knees before you release the ball because the power of your shot comes from your knees.
Flicking your hand will cause the ball to spin backwards after you release it. This helps with the accuracy of your shot.
Keep your back straight as you release the ball.If you are shooting with two hands, both of your hands will go through the shooting motion.
Think of your elbow as a lever when you are shooting and only move the top portion (i.e. forearm area).

, To be a good Goal Attack or Goal Shooter, you don't have to be able to get goals from a long way away from the ring, it's great if you can though., The shooting technique can be overwhelming. There are so many things to remember. BEEF can help you remember the key aspects of shooting a netball.B for balance. Keep your feet hip/shoulder width apart and pointing towards the goal.
E for eyes. Keep your eyes focused on where you want the ball to go.
E for elbow. Keep your elbows close to your ears as you shoot.
F for follow through. Always flick your hand and wrist at the end of your shot.

Find an indoor or outdoor regulation netball court.It measures 100 feet (30.5 meters) long and 50 feet (15.25 m) wide.,
Form a team of 10 or more players.,
Assign positions to the players.,
Get a referee who knows the rules.",How to Play Netball1," The court has horizontal lines dividing it into thirds. There is a circle 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter in the center of the court. There are 2 goal semicircles, each with a radius of 16 feet (4.9 m) at each end. The 15-inch-wide (38 cm) goal ring extends horizontally from a 10-foot (3 m) post located at the midpoint of each goal line. Not only is the hoop smaller than basketball, there's no backboard.If you're playing in your backyard try to set up a field of this general size. Using a basketball is okay if you don't have a netball, but the nets are pretty important if you want to play the game.;
, If you have over 14 players have some as subs and rotate them in.

, Only 2 players, identified by the insignia GS (Goal Shooter) and GA (Goal Attack), can score. The other 5 positions are Goalkeeper (GK), Goal Defense (GD), Wing Attack (WA), Wing Defense (WD) and Center (C).These identification letters are displayed on the front and back of each player's jersey.The center stands in the small circle in the center of the court. The center is both an attacker and defender because they are in the middle. They are allowed anywhere on the court other than the goal circles. The center circle has a diameter of ten yards.
The wing attack position tries to feed the ball to the goal shooters. They are positioned at the top third of the field toward the opponent’s goal. The wing attack position is not allowed in the goal circle.
Wing defenders defend against the wing attack position, trying to keep the ball out of their third of the court. Wing defenders are allowed in the center third and their own third, but not the goal circle.
The goal attack position is allowed to shoot the ball at the goal and also pass it to the goal shooters in the goal circle. These players are allowed in the center third, the opponents third, and the goal circle.
The goal defense position defends against the goal attack position. They are allowed in all the same areas as the goal attack position.
The goal shoot position is only allowed in the opposing team's goal circle and the opponent's third. Their job is to catch passes from their other two attacking teammates and try to shoot on the goal.
The goal keeper is only allowed in their own goal circle and their own defending third. They must stop the other players from getting the ball and shooting on the goal.

, You don’t need a referee if you’re just playing for fun, obviously, but if you wanted to organize a competitive game you should find an experienced netball player to act as a referee.

"
"
Shoot by yourself.,
Shoot with a defensive partner.,
Combine shooting and cardio.",How to Shoot in Netball2," Shoot by yourself and really focus on your technique. Take shots from different angles around the post. Focus on the quality of the shots you are taking and not the number of shots. Evaluate each shot and ask yourself some questions:Did I flick my hand at the end of my shot?
Did my elbows touch my ears throughout my shot?
Did I bend my knees?
Did I keep my arms stretched above my head?
Did I release the ball above my head?, It is much easier to shoot when you have no one defending you. However, this is an unlikely scenario when you are playing a game. Have a partner defend you as you practice your shooting. Practicing with a defender in front of you will simulate game pressure and teach you to shoot the ball over the defender.


Ask your partner to point out any mistakes in your technique during this drill.This drill can help you build confidence in your shooting abilities.

, Your technique may suffer when you become tired. Incorporating cardio into shooting practice will help you build endurance and stamina. Place a ball anywhere in the semicircle. Sprint to the sideline, sprint back to the ball, pick up the ball, and then shoot. Try to get in 10 shots as fast as you can.You will need a partner to retrieve balls for you during this drill. Your partner should place the ball in a different spot in the semi-circle each time.Focus more on your technique as you become tired.

"
"
Use your fingers when shooting.,
Maintain the correct shooting stance.,
Practice in a focused way.",How to Shoot in Netball3," Keep your fingers relaxed and rest the ball on the pads of your fingers.If your fingers are too straight or stiff, you will not be able to hold the ball in the correct position. Also make sure that your fingers are spread out on the ball.









Be careful not to apply pressure to the ball with your opposite hand. This can change the trajectory of your shot.
It will take practice to correctly balance the netball. You want to cradle the ball and make sure that it is stable, but you do not want to hold too tightly and have trouble releasing it either.

, Make sure your feet are in a good position. If your feet are not hip width apart, you may be off balance when you shoot. Keep your feet parallel and do not let one foot be too far in front of the other. You do not want to be too close to a defender while you are shooting.








Your hips and shoulders should be in a straight line. Many people allow their shoulders to move forward which will cause the whole body to move forward. Leaning forward when you shoot will change the trajectory of your shot.
If you are having trouble keeping your hips and shoulder aligned, have someone hold your shoulders back as you shoot so that you can feel what the correct position is.

, Try to practice shooting for 15 or 20 minutes each day, even on the days that you have a team practice. Shooting will eventually become second nature to you. You will be less affected by fatigue or a defender in front of you if you are comfortable with your shot.








You only have three seconds to shoot when you are in the game. Try not to hold the ball too long even when you are practicing.
Whether you are practicing alone or with a partner as a defender, focus on the back of the ring as you shoot.
Try to practice with a coach or a more experienced shooter. Constructive feedback can help you grow as a player.

Do not move at all with the ball.,
Keep seven players from each team on the court at all times.,
Stand three feet away from the player with the ball if you are a defender.,
Follow the three-second ball possession rule.,
Remain in your designated position zone.,
Keep the ball in bounds.",How to Play Netball2," You cannot dribble, only pivot with the foot you land on first. The number one rule of netball is that you cannot travel with the ball. Although the game has some similarities to basketball, this rule is more like ultimate Frisbee. Basically, once you have the ball you can only pivot. You must always keep one foot in the same place., The only exception to this is if a referee sends off a player from one team for an infraction.

, You cannot be closer than three feet than the player, but you can be as far away as you want. Standing too close is an example of an infraction. You can’t get in another player's face, and you have to give them room to survey the floor. You can jump up and down and defend the pass, but you have to give them room to throw.This means that you cannot snatch or grab the ball out of another player's hands. You can intercept the ball in the air, but if someone has control of the ball you must keep your distance.

, You are not allowed to hold the ball for more than three seconds at a time. Dropping the ball and picking it up again does not reset the possession clock. Similarly, if you try to pass to someone and miss and you grab the ball again the possession clock still does not end. If you hold the ball for more than three seconds you must give it up to the other team.

, Players must stay in position. You can’t run around like a free safety in football. You have to stay in the zones designated for your position.Refer to the position list.

, If the ball goes out of bounds, the team that touched the ball last must give the ball up to the other team. The other team picks up the ball and goes to the line where it went out.They now have three seconds to throw it back into play once they reach this line.

Toss a coin.,
Begin play with a center pass.,
Score a goal.,
Follow the major and minor rules of the game to avoid penalties.,
Play netball for 4 quarters, each 15 minutes long.,
Win the game.",How to Play Netball3," This is how you decide first possession of the ball or which goal end each team starts in. Whoever did not toss the coin calls the coin while it is in the air. If it lands on what they called, they get the ball. You can also do a throw up. A player from each team stands opposite each other, facing the way they are shooting, a metre away from each other. The coach or Umpire then tosses the ball up in between them and the first one to catch the ball decides whether they want the first center pass or they can choose which way they want to shoot. , The Center (C) stands in the center circle and passes the ball to a teammate standing in the center third of the court. After each goal is scored, play resumes with another center pass.

, You can score a goal by shooting the ball through your team's goal ring while standing inside the goal circle. The other team's goalie will be protecting this net. The goal attack and goal shoot players are allowed to score goals.

, There are 2 umpires on the court, who make decisions during the game and call penalties.


Major rules prohibit contact (accidental or deliberate), obstructing play, and intimidating your opponents. Should someone break a major rule, the offending player has to stand out of play while the other team throws a pass or shot from where the offense occurred.Minor rules prohibit holding the ball for more than 3 seconds, stepping while in possession of the ball, moving out of the designated area for the position (offsides) or throwing the ball over a third of the court. Should an infringement on a minor rule occur, the other team gets a free pass from where the offense occurred.

, There is a 5 or 10-minute break at halftime and a 3-minute break after the first and third quarters.

, You win the game by scoring more goals than the other team before the game is over. Easier said than done!

Be confident.,
Watch others play.,
Keep fit.,
Be kind to the opposing team.,
Know your position.,
Play with all your might.,
Don't get discouraged.,
Ask for tips.,
Help your team as much as you can.,
Give it your all.",How to Play Defence in Netball," Confidence is key in netball; every ounce of you has to have the will to succeed. Build up your confidence by improving catching and throwing skills with a partner. Practise the different passes such as Shoulder, Chest, Underarm, Overarm etc. Once you are confident in these two skills, you will be a much more hopeful netball player.;
, They may seem unhelpful but it can also improve your netball skills. Watch others and try to pick out things they are doing wrong, need to improve on and what they are doing right. Then compare their skills to yours- what can you learn from them? Write it down in a notebook and go over the notes regularly, checking off anything you have learnt.

, Exercise daily and eat healthy on a regular basis. This will not only improve mood and confidence, it will improve how you play the game. A more lean body can run faster than a more plump body, for example.

, Instead of being rude, be kind. After all, it is just a game and you will need to keep a calm head to play it. Unkindness can result in arguments and insults, leaving you feeling frustrated and hurt, which can affect your overall performance by miles.

, Know what position you are playing in. Is it WA, GK, C etc? If you know your position, you can focus on what the requirements are and how to play better in it. Say you are GK, you will need to be able to jump up and catch high, move swiftly and fast and you have to stay in the half court. Taller players are usually defence, GK, WA & Wing Defence and shorter players center etc, but this is not always the case.

, Pass powerfully, catch correctly, run rapidly and be happy and hopeful. Shout to your team members when you are about to pass to them, mark your opponents and muster all your strength. Don't be downhearted if you lose, there is always another time!

, Usually taller people are picked for netball because they can block and catch easier and throw higher distances, but if you are short do not get disheartened. Make sure you are part of the team and no one is leaving you out and play well, you will be rewarded for it.

, Ask your fellow team members and netball umpires for tips on netball so you can improve. Know your weaknesses and strength and try to elaborate on them. This will kit only make you a better netball player but a better person.

, Whenever the ball is passed to the player you're marking immediately intercept it and pass it onto one of the players from your team who is most suitable.

, Make sure you never miss a chance where you could've got the ball. Always mark you're player.

Understand the reasoning behind a ""held ball"".,
Be prepared to react quickly with a held ball.,
Practise counting the three seconds and knowing what can be done in that space of time.",How to Play a Held Ball in Netball," Play must remain swift and unimpeded. Without rules as to holding onto a ball for too long, a player could delay a game unfairly for the other team. A held ball concept provides for quick thinking reaction time for the player with the ball and ensures the maintenance of the pace of the game.;
, You will have three seconds to pass the ball on to another team player or to shoot it. If you do not play it within the three seconds, a free pass is awarded to the opposing team at the place where the player over-held the ball.

, Three seconds should be enough time to allow you to locate another team member to pass to, or to take that goal shoot. You can practise ingraining how long three seconds takes at home. Watch the second hand on a watch or clock while you wait in a queue; watch three seconds pass as the microwave cooks. Develop a movement or time sequence in your mind that matches those three seconds to help you make the most of this time on the court.

Completely understand the role before you take it on.,
Deliver the ball to the shooters.,
Outsmart your defender and get into space.,
Execute the center pass.",How to Play Center in Netball," It includes giving that center pass at the beginning of the match, continuously running up and down the court, pulling the team together and supporting shooters in the defender (D). It also involves a great deal more, as you'll discover upon playing.;
, You need to drive down the court and make space to receive the ball.


As soon as the umpire blows the whistle and it's your centre pass, the wing attack (WA) should drive square, a ready option.
When WA receives the ball, goal attack (GA) should cut back down court, but C should drive across, to make a down-the-line option.
Once C receives the ball, GA/GS (goal shooter) should make themselves available, with one of them catching the ball and the other positioning themselves under the hoop, ready for the ball and ready to shoot.

, Fake/dodge or some kind of movement to get past your defender (in front of them).


Run quickly into space for your teammate to pass to you.
Be in a space that your teammate can pass to you without error, without the other team intercepting the ball.

, You and your team need to confirm who is cutting forward and sliding back so you can sharply get that ball to the D.

Stand side on towards the attacker , which allows you to see your attacker but also the ball.,When intercepting the ball side on make sure its always your outer arm ( arm furthest form attacker ) to avoid contact

,
Make sure you push you attacker wide ( not literally )   by stop your attacker from getting close to the net by:

When the attacker/opposing player is passing the ball , as a defender you must make sure to stand one meter / 100 centimeters (39.4 in) with both arms up and on your tip toes to block the attacker.

,
As a GD or GK when the shooters are in position make sure you are one meter / 100 centimeters (39.4 in) away with both or one, depending on how small you are leaning over the shooter.,

Know when a ball is ""out of court"":


The ball touches the ground outside of the court
The ball touches a person or an object situation out of the court
The ball is being held by a player who comes into contact with the ground, another person, or an object situated outside of the court.,
Blow the whistle.,
Provide a throw in to the opposing team.",How to Deal With a Ball out of Court in Netball,";
, When the umpire sees a ball go out of court, the umpire must blow the whistle to stop play.

, The penalty to the team that has caused the ball to go out of court is the provision of a throw-in to the opposing team. This throw-in should be taken from the position at the edge of the court where the ball crossed over the court into the outside grounds.

"
"
Understand the meanings of the relevant terms:


Substitution: a player leaves the court and is replaced by another player
Team change: players already on court change playing positions.,
Know the times when a substitution or team change is permitted.,
Make substitutions or team changes as much as is desired within the times permitted.",How to Make Substitutions and Team Changes in Netball,";
, In general, both teams have the right to make these changes provided they are made within the allowed periods. The changes or substitutions can occur:


During intervals/breaks
As a result of injury or illness, where play has been stopped (the injured party should be involved in this decision where viable)

, There is no limit placed upon the amount of times changes are made, although all changes must be made using the 12 players who were named for the match (i.e., you cannot bring in an additional unnamed player 13).

"
Lock your ankle.,
Pass the ball with the inside of the shoe.,
Position your planter foot.,
Kick a pass on the ground.,
Kick a pass in the air.",How to Kick a Soccer Ball1," Locking your ankle ensures that your foot isn't flimsy and doesn't move at all when it contacts the ball. The foot needs to control how the ball moves. For an inside of the foot pass, the toes should point up to lock the ankle. For a shot, on the other hand, the toes should point down to lock the ankle.








The only way to achieve no spin is to lock your ankle. If the foot is flimsy, the ball will make equally flimsy movements and motions.;
, Never pass on your toe. Soccer players pass using the inside of the foot because it uses a wider surface area and makes for the most accurate kick.









The downside to this kick is that you don't get as much power out of it. Still, it is definitely the most accurate way to pass.

, Turn your planter foot (the foot you are not using to kick) so that the inside of your shoe is facing the ball. Remember, your planter foot will point to where the ball ends up. If you want to kick the ball straight ahead, plant that foot facing straight ahead.







, Follow through with your foot close to the ground. For short passes and passes on the ground, you only need to follow through a few feet. Don't lift your foot far off the ground.








Notice the spin on the ball. An inside of the foot pass should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, you need to lock your ankle, or you might have moved your passing leg in the right trajectory.

, Lean your body back and follow through with your foot in the air. This time, extend your foot fully, and follow through so that your foot ends up several feet in the air. Make sure that if you're passing in the air, you keep your foot closer the the ground than you would for a ground pass so that the ball will go into the air.








Again, notice the spin on the ball. Just like a pass on the ground, a pass in the air should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, make sure you're locking your ankle and watching your passing leg.

"
"
Take a few steps back.,
Lock your ankle.,
Shoot the ball using the top of your foot, on the laces.,
Position your planter foot.,
Follow through on your kick.,
Understand how your lean affects the shot.,
Land on your shooting foot.",How to Kick a Soccer Ball2," Do you ever watch soccer players take a corner kick or penalty kick? Soccer players line up only a few steps behind the ball. You don't need to get a running start from 15 feet (4.6 m) away to strike the ball well. In fact, getting a 15 foot (4.6 m) running start will probably keep you from hitting the ball well.







, This keeps your foot stable so that it doesn't move when it contacts the ball. The foot needs to control how the ball moves, rather than the ball moving the foot. If you're trying to achieve a no-spin shot, the only way you'll be able to is by locking your ankle. If the foot is flimsy, the ball will make equally flimsy movements and motions.







, Never use your toe to kick the ball. Toe-kicking the ball makes it impossible to control where you want to put it. And accuracy is the most important thing you need when shooting the ball.








, Your planter foot is the foot you're not kicking with, the foot that you plant next to the ball. It should be pointed in the direction you want the ball to go. You should also bend your foot and kick the ball with your toe pointed down at the ground. There's a sweet spot on your foot, halfway up your laces, that you should try to use to drive the ball every time.









Don't try to kick the ball too hard, and remember to keep your eyes on the ball the whole time.

, Make sure your toe is pointed toward the ground. The power of your kick might send both of your feet off the ground as you shoot. Bring your leg back to generate force. You'll get speed and power.









If you want to kick a long way, jump at the end while kicking the ball. This will give it your kick even more force.

, Remember that the farther you lean back as you kick, the higher the ball will get. If your body is straight (vertical) when you kick, you should get a shot that's low to the ground or mid-height.









If done correctly, the ball should have no spin once you've kicked it, like a knuckleball shot. If it's spinning outside in, you might have moved your passing leg in the right trajectory or didn't lock your ankle.

, You should jump and leap through the ball as you strike it. Keep your head down. Your knee should be above the ball while you keep your hips pointed in the direction you want the ball to go.








This approach is used to gain more power behind the ball.

"
"
Hook the ball.,
Slice the ball.,
Chip the ball.",How to Kick a Soccer Ball3," To hook the ball, hit it on the inside of your foot, but slightly turn your foot forward as you kick the ball. Your foot should be at a 45 degree angle when you follow through.








, To slice the ball, hit it on the outside of your foot, with your foot trailing away from the ball as you strike it. This time, your foot should be at a 45 degree angle facing the other way (compared to a hook) when you follow through.








, In order to chip the ball, bring your foot down onto the ball and don't follow through that much (if at all). You want to strike the ball right under the tip of your shoe, without using your toe.







"
"
Kick the ball while sitting down.,
Practice your kick standing up.",How to Kick a Soccer Ball4," Lightly kick the ball out of your hands with the top of one foot. Lock your ankles. When your foot connects with the ball, the ball should connect with the ""laces"" part of your foot, or where the laces would be if you were wearing cleats. The ball should only go up a couple feet, with little or no spin.









Try connecting with your dominant foot first, and then alternate to your non-dominant foot. Skilled soccer players can kick the ball just as well with their non-dominant foot as they can with their dominant one.

, Now that you've practiced kicking while sitting down, it's time to practice while standing up. Again, try to kick the ball up only a couple feet, with little spin.









Stand up and do the same thing. Drop the ball over your foot and kick up gently. Practice your coordination here.
Again, look for no spin in the ball when you kick it up.

Be prepared to move often.",How to Become a Professional Soccer Player," It is this love for the game that will drive you to become a professional soccer player. Passion will help you push through the negative and challenging moments. Professional soccer must be something that you want to do. Don't do it because it's expected of you, or because it's someone else's dream.


If you want to be a professional player in today's market, you have to be fully committed. Every inch of your being needs to be determined to play. If you are hedging your bets, you won't be as good of a player as you can be.;
, Learn as much about soccer as you can. Read books, watch matches and DVDs, and talk with great soccer players. Ask them about their tactics and what they've found helpful as they have climbed the ranks.


Have a solid understanding of what famous soccer players have done to succeed and their signature moves.

, Train everyday, make time to train, time to play the beautiful game, because at the end of the day you only get one shot.


You can improve your dribble skills and reflex by seeing yourself as the only hope on a play ground and making up a player to dribble through your imagination; then make use of your favorite moves in dribbling your imagination. 

, Don't worry so much about playing on a team early on. Get your friends and parents to play soccer with you as much as possible from an early age. Shift to playing in organized youth teams some time between the ages of 5 and 14.

, Attend training camps as early as possible. If your club or association of clubs offers training camps, summer camps, etc., make use of these. You'll feed off the enthusiasm and competitiveness of other players. You'll also learn a lot in an intense, short period of time.


Get involved in organized games as early as possible. Try to get into matches and tournaments that represent your school, region, state or country at the youth level.

, Choose a school team, local club, or district team that you can attend regularly and that has a good coach. The best option would be an academy, known for grooming young players to become professionals. Continue with youth teams every year, progressing to more competitive and selective teams every time you level up.


Eventually, move from youth teams to scholastic and collegiate teams. Then move to amateur and semi-professional level teams and clubs. Climb the levels gradually, being sure to play against senior players.If you're in the USA, aim to get into a college that has a top soccer program in place.

, Focus completely on training to become a professional. You'll need to practice nearly every day, regardless of the weather. You'll also need to balance practice with your studies or even part-time work. It is the practice, the daily dedication, that will develop your talent and hone your skills.


If you're a parent of a child seeking to become a professional player, your own level of dedication must be enormous. You may need to transport your child to games, buy soccer gear and membership fees, talk with coaches, help with informal practice sessions, or boost your child's morale. You might even coach youth soccer.

, Accept that turning professional is a gradual process. You'll continue to learn, build your technical skills, learn soccer knowledge, make good contacts with other people.


Look for professional development programs and see how you can become a part of these. Ask your coach or club mentors for advice on what's available.

, After you've played for a while, seriously look at your skills. Find out what position your innate skills are best suited to. When working this out, don't just think about yourself. Think about how your skills feed into your teamwork, and how your strengths fit into the game as a whole. It's important that you are exceptional at what you do because there is a lot of competition.


Seek your coach's honest opinion about your strengths and your chances. Learn from your coach's suggestions about possible ways to improve or hone your natural talent.

, If you're not, make an honest assessment about how you can improve your skills or if you need to shift to a different position. You should also be able to prove that you're good in games. Be consistently good and show that you can deliver every week, not just once in a while.


If you're the outstanding player of the week every week, you're on the right track.

, Soccer is a team sport and good communication is vital. Prove at all times that you are good at communicating. Use your manners, express yourself clearly, avoid unruly or angry behaviour on the field, and be a team-player.


A player who is too much of an individual player, or refuses to communicate properly, is a liability on a team and not likely to go far.

, Your fitness levels matter in soccer. Exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and avoid substances that can impair your performance, such as alcohol. Get enough sleep every night. It is also important to learn how to try to stay injury-free. Learn how to play well from the start and how to keep in good physical shape by stretching and exercising.

, Even when you're not at the club, practice your skills alone or with friends and family members. Try to get good experience with older players as often as possible. Aim to improve your technical ability at all times. Work with the ball until everything you do with it seems like second nature.Work on your weaker skills too, to strengthen your skills-set and adaptability.

, Playing professional soccer is uncertain and unstable. Prepare for short-term contracts, the risks of injury, and inevitable aging and loss of skill. These realities can create feelings of insecurity and burnout.Public exposure can be overwhelming if you do make it to the top. This can be tiring and even lead to depression.


Consider seeing a sports health professional or sports psychologist to develop coping strategies if you don't already have these skills soundly in place. Learn early that it's okay to talk things out with someone you trust rather than keeping worries bottled up inside.

, Clubs might hold trials or talent days. They also tend to rely on the network they have in place to spot the best players and refer outstanding players onwards.Involve yourself in all important tryouts. Make the most of these opportunities by meeting as many people as possible, exchanging details, and following up on leads.


Ask about how or whether your club encourages talent scouts to visit your club.

, A scout might appear at any time to check out your team. A scout will watch your entire attitude, not just your ball play. You'll be watched for character as much as talent.Show your team spirit by helping your team mates. Show your ambition and competitiveness, but don't be mean.


You should also show that you can be calm and focused under pressure. Remember to play your best at all times. You never know who's in the crowd.

, Clubs and agents will expect you to move quickly to meet their wants, without caring much about your personal life or the long-term prospects for your career.Be fully prepared for this and continue to focus on your soccer skills.


Before you move, consider: how often you'll be playing, if you speak the language of where you'll be moved, if the pay is adequate, if the club is challenging and has a good reputation, and if there is good medical treatment if you would become injured."
"
Pick up the ball with both hands, one on each side of the ball.,
Position your feet facing the field, with your toes on the sideline.,
Arch your back slightly.,
Starting behind your head, bring the ball up and over your head.,
Release the ball with a forward flick of the wrists.,
Run onto the field to re-enter play, but don't touch the ball until one other player has.,
Review the rules to ensure perfect, legal throw-ins.",How to Do a Throw in Soccer1," Your hands should be roughly evenly spaced -- if the ball was a clock, your right hand would be at 3:00 and your left at 9:00. It can help to shift them back a bit, too, so your thumbs are almost touching in the back of the ball. This helps you get a bit more leverage on the throw.


Throw-ins only occur when the whole ball passes over one of the sidelines. You must throw the ball from the point where it left the field.;
, Both feet must be behind or on the sideline, and touching the ground, for a legal throw. Separate your feet and point your toes to the field, setting them up however you're comfortable. If you want to try a running throw, stand a few feet behind the sideline so that you can run up to the line without crossing it. Some players like to keep their feet together, while others like one foot in front of the other.


Remember that your feet cannot cross the line when throwing the ball in -- this is an infraction that can cost your team the ball., Many players try to throw exclusively with their arms, but most of the power should come from your back and shoulders, as well as the momentum from your running start. Think of your body like a catapult being pulled back -- your feet are still firmly planted, but your spine becomes a loaded spring. Do this right before you're ready to actually throw the ball.


For now, just work on arching as much as is comfortable. Work on getting proper form first, then throwing the ball further later. A light bend is enough to start learning with.

, A legal throw in must travel ""from behind and over his head.""Referees might be a touch lenient here for a quick throw, but you must, at least, start with the ball held above your head.


You will likely get called for an infraction if you start a throw from your forehead, or further forward. This can happen accidentally on quick throws.

, Bring your arms up and forward so that your hands and the ball travel directly over your head. At the same time, bring your arched back forward like a spring and (if performing a running throw) drag the toe of your back foot on the ground. Extend your arms fully and release the ball from just behind the head. Remember to keep your head up and facing straight after the ball is released so you don't just throw the ball to the ground.


Your release point depends on how far the throw needs to go. For big throws, let go as you pass over your head. For shorter passes, hold onto the ball until you cross your forehead or so.
You cannot spin the ball with one hand. The ball must leave both hands evenly though most referees are okay as long as you don't intentionally spin the ball., You cannot touch your own throw-in until another player (on either team) has touched it. So get back out there to help move the ball into scoring position. If, on the other hand, you accidentally threw the ball to your opponent, you can make up for it by running out to try to steal the ball back. Always follow up your throw by getting back in the game and back in position, ready for play to resume.

, The rules for throws are not super difficult, but you should be mindful of them with every throw. Even the pros sometimes step over the line and get caught, but it is no less embarrassing when you do it in a game. A legal throw-in must have all of the following elements:


You are facing the field of play
Both of your feet are on or behind the line and are at least touching the ground.
You use two hands with even pressure (cannot spin the ball)
The ball comes from behind and over your head.
You cannot score directly off a throw-in."
"
Make gentle contact with the ball.,
Keep the ball close to your feet.,
Use the leading edge of the foot to dribble galloping.,
Keep the ball in the lower edge of your peripheral vision.,
Change the pace.,
Use your body to protect the ball.,
Practice dribbling in a field.,
Practice speed dribbling.,
Dribble in and out through cones with one foot.,
Practice a crossover drill through cones with both feet.,
Practice an inside-outside drill through cones with both feet.,
Practice roll-inside drills.,
Practice passing the ball back and forth without cones.",How to Develop Good Soccer Dribbling Skills," Every time you contact the ball in soccer, it’s called a “touch.” By using gentle touches, you contact the ball more often, which will slow you down initially, but as you get used to making more contact with the ball, it will allow you to advance quickly, but with more control over the ball.









The more your foot touches the ball, the more control you have over the ball's movement.;
, Keep your knees bent as you pass the ball back and forth between the insides of your feet. Against an opponent, your body should be between the defender and the ball.You'll also be able to change direction faster.








When you keep the ball close to your feet, defenders have a more difficult time intercepting the ball.

, Gallop with the same foot forward every time you step forward. This keeps the ball close to your foot at all times. Keep the leading edge of your foot forward as you’re running. This keeps contact between the ball and the leading edge of your foot, giving you the most speed and balance.








This doesn’t apply to making cuts, stops, direction changes, etc. This is just for moving the ball downfield with as much speed and control as possible., Beginners, especially, tend to use most of their field of vision on the ball as they develop dribbling skills. Instead, you should practice keeping the ball at the bottom of your peripheral vision as early in the learning process as possible.








By keeping the ball in your lower field of vision, you can more easily maintain awareness of the rest of the field. This can help you see holes in defenses, open teammates, scoring positions, etc., Proceeding in an easily predictable manner is the easiest way to get hung up by a defender. Practice changes in your dribbling pace. This way, you can more fluidly change pace in confusing ways on the field to throw defenders off balance.








, Shield the ball with your body when a defender gets close. You can use your whole body to protect the ball. Use your arms, legs, and shoulders to keep the defender away from the ball. Make sure that you are between the defender and the ball.You can also try to keep the ball on the foot that is furthest from the defender.








, Find a long open space where you can practice sprinting while using gentle, leading edge touches. Keep the ball within a few feet of you rather than several yards ahead. In an open field, your gallop should change to more of a run, since you don't need as much control of the ball.








, Speed dribbling refers to moving the ball downfield with speed and control. For a proper speed dribbling technique, your foot should be slightly turned in at the ankle with the front of the foot down. This way, the front-outside of the shoe contacts the ball just above the middle toe.








This method should lead to contact with the ball every five to eight steps. Make the contacts in your running stride without having to slow considerably to contact the ball., Set up five cones, each roughly three feet apart, and use one foot to weave the ball through the cones. Alternate between the leading edge of your foot and the inside part of your instep to pass the ball back and forth between the cones.Once you reach the end of the five cones, simply turn around and start back through them in the opposite direction. You can do this drill in several bursts such as down and back three times before taking a break.









If you knock the cones over, you're going too fast or don't have enough control of the ball. Slow down until you don't knock the cones over.
Since being able to use both feet is extremely important in soccer, don’t try this drill using only your dominant foot. Run the drill, take a break, and then run it again with your other foot.

, This drill requires the inside instep of both feet. Pass the ball forward between the cones with one foot, and then pass it back with the other foot while weaving it through the next set of cones.This side-to-side motion is great practice for changing direction of the ball on a moment’s notice.









You don’t necessarily need to make one single touch with each foot between each set of cones. You might stop the ball with the inner part of the foot before using it to pass the ball back. Keep the ball in control and practice doing the drill with as much speed as possible. If you have to look down at the ball while moving through the cones, keep working at it so you know where the ball is without looking.

, Give the ball some momentum between the cones with the inner instep of the foot from the side you’re starting. If you start by passing the ball from the left side of the cones, use the left foot. Then use the leading edge of the other foot to continue the ball’s movement through the same set of cones.








Take another step with the first foot without touching the ball. Then use the inner instep of the previous leading edge foot to catch the ball. Start it through the next set of cones., Place your foot on top of the ball, and then roll the ball between the cones. You should roll at such an angle that the ball passes in front of the foot you use to roll when the foot comes off. You’ll then use the inner instep of the other foot to catch the ball before using the roll maneuver again to pass it back.








Like the inside-outside drill, take another step with the original rolling foot between the inside foot stop and the next roll movement. This allows you to position yourself correctly.

, You can just as easily practice crossover skill without cones. Begin by passing the ball between both feet without any forward movement. Simply use the inner parts of both feet to pass the ball back and forth. Practice this maneuver at varying speeds and also while introducing forward and backward movement.

Move; as soon as the horn/whistle blows get to cover.,
Spread your team out, don’t concentrate your entire team in one section of the course, it makes it far too easy for an opponent to move around your flank and take down half of your team.

,
Move in pairs if possible.,
It is vital that you keep moving, being covered and covering your teammates (shooting down range (at the enemy’s position) when they move).

,
Move down the sides of the course if possible, this gives you a better angle of fire on the enemy to thin their numbers before the eventual run for the flag.

,
Pin down the opposition (fire at them so intensely that they won’t wish to break cover) when moving for the flag.,
Moving back to your base with the flag can be done multiple ways.,
Detail a course of action to be taken in the event that the opposing team reaches the flag before you do.,
Break cover and start firing if an opponent has the flag and is running towards their base.,
Finding yourself cornered, launch yourself quickly and unexpectedly from cover to cover, firing as you go.,
Make sure your team has the whole field covered.",How to Win a Game of Paintball (Capture the Flag)," Don’t waste your time trying to spray down range on your way, just get to cover as soon as possible.;
,, That is, travel in a group of two so one person can cover the other while they move from location to location. This is one of the most effective strategies for a game of this nature. It affords a certain adaptability from a pre-game plan that is vital in effecting a decisive victory.

,,, Have as many of your teammates as possible do so. It’s a huge advantage if the opposing team is unaware of who has the flag and where that person is once it has been removed.

, If there are only a few opponents left then a flat out run towards the base is advisable (zigzagging the entire way). If there is a strong opposing force left then this would be impossible and one’s movements must be covered by teammates. The flag could even be handed to a teammate to throw off the opposition.

, Needless to say this will require you and your teammates to be more brazen in your movements. If it’s a small course a center third of your team should fire on the enemy positions while the other two thirds charge down the flanks. If it’s a large course then it’s likely that a team member located on the flanks of the field can snipe the runner if they make a break for it.

, Better the loss of half of your team than the loss of the game.

, Chances are the opposition will be too shocked to react immediately. There’s still a chance you can win the game by eliminating the other team.

, When playing 2v2 or 3v3, make sure one person is always covering the extreme sides of the course. If you get flanked, you are done for.

Work quickly.,
Aim for your teammates feet whenever possible.,
Put some power on your throws, treating them like passes.,
Scan the field for players on the move.,
Use a running throw for added distance.,
Throw the ball down the line towards you opponents goal when in doubt.,
Never throw the ball in directly in front of you, or ""square"" to the field.",How to Do a Throw in Soccer2," Throw-ins are rarely great offensive opportunities, and this is by design

, The easier you can make it for your teammate to trap the ball and start moving, the better for everyone. Try to land the ball near their feet so that they can treat it just like a pass. Note, however, that there are times when your aim needs to change up a bit:


If you communicate well, a throw to your teammates head, allowing them to flick it on, is a great way to get two quick passes in and scramble the defense.
If there is a lot of traffic, and you're worried about getting picked off, aim for the chest. Your teammate can use their body to trap and shield the ball, and it is a much bigger target to hit., Don't just float the ball in. This gives the defense plenty of time to react and pressure the ball, which generally means your teammate is under attack before the ball even gets there. Put a little ""oomph"" on your throws, really dialing them in like passes. While you don't want to chuck it at a teammate, you don't want to lob it in, either.


If you're flexible and comfortable with a front handspring, try out a powerful flip throw., Deciding where to deliver the ball is the most important step. You may have set plays for this or you may just need to find an open player. Once you've made your decision, you'll need to execute quickly so that your opponent can't detect where you're going to throw. It is always best to hit a teammate on the run instead of standing still. Movement makes the defense react -- standing still makes their lives easy.

, Get a short running start--just 2-4 steps--to help you gain the needed momentum to power the ball to its target. Plant whatever foot is comfortable behind the line as you start your throw. Your back foot, which still has momentum, drags on the ground behind you to ensure you still keep both feet down.


Your strong leg should be forward which is the opposite of how it would be if you were throwing a baseball.
In general, anything longer than 2-3 steps doesn't add much more power to the throw.

, If you've got no options, your team isn't moving, and the referee is telling you to ""hurry it up,"" chuck it down the line towards your opponents goal. This leaves the defense few simple options to handle the ball, and the most likely result will be another throw in further down the field.


Tell your teammates, if possible, to sprint down the line as you're throwing. If you can pressure the defense quickly off the ball you have a better chance of forcing an error.

, Never throw the ball straight ahead, unless there are no defenders or pressure (like deep in your own defensive half). Think about it -- a throw-in is a high, slow, and predictable pass, one that is easily read and picked off. Furthermore, your teammate will receive the ball facing the worst possible direction -- the sideline. The chances of an error or, even worst, getting picked off, are compounded by the fact that the defense running after the ball is heading right towards your goal."

Get a Tippmann 98 Custom, they cost about $50 used on ebay.,
People believe the single most important factor determining the accuracy of a paintball marker is the barrel.,
Increase rate of fire.Speedball is a paintball variation that demands a high rate of fire, especially for back players.,
Polish the receivers When a Tippmann 98 Custom is painted at the factory, paint gets on the inside of the gun where the internal parts move.,
Install a regulator A regulator is a necessity if you want a consistent marker.,
Get a fast loader If using either the response trigger system or an electronic system, a gravity fed hopper will not be adequate, as gravity hoppers can feed only a few paintballs per second and some extensively modified Tippmann 98s can fire nearly 20 paintballs per second.",How to Turn a Tippmann 98 Custom Into a Speedball Marker," You can't build a speedball gun from a 98 Custom if you don't have one, unless of course you want to use the A5. The best Tippmanns are the newest ones that have a system called A.C.T.(Anti Chop Technology). With A.C.T., the marker virtually cannot chop paintballs which is a fairly significant problem when upgrading 98s for high rates of fire, this upgrade kit will cost you an additional $35.;
, If your paintballs fit the barrel well, it will be accurate. Paintballs come in slightly different sizes even though they all say .68 caliber. To compensate for these fluctuations in size, you may want to think about slightly under boring, or using a barrel that is every so slightly smaller than the paintball itself. A barrel kit is a good way to do this ($100+ used) and include different sized barrels or barrel inserts so that you can always have an exact paint-to-bore match, your other option is a single decent barrel ($40 used) or just leaving things be. Ages ago barrels used to be an upgrade to paintball guns, in today's market the barrels that come stock are usually stock performers.

, When deciding on the best way to increase your rate of fire, you can either choose to go with a mechanical system or to convert to electronics. The mechanical response trigger will be cheaper than the electronic E-Trigger system, but is usually not tournament legal because it cannot control R.O.F with precision. The E-Trigger allows for more control over the rate of fire and gives a more typical ""speedball marker"" setup for a paltry price of $80 off ebay.


To continue, the response trigger system by Tippmann is a kit made for the 98 Custom that uses a pneumatic system to reset the trigger much faster than one can pull the trigger, thus allowing for rates of fire. The highest estimates for the response trigger are around 17 paintballs per second.
The Tippmann E-Trigger system replaces the mechanical tripping of the sear with electronic parts that can move as fast as 30 paintballs per second, though most say that the upper 20s is as fast a rate of fire as the 98 can handle, but the rate of fire will be better if the amount of friction in the gun is lower.

, This causes unnecessary friction within the marker. Consistency can be greatly improved by sanding and polishing the inside of the receivers. You're going to want to polish these to a near mirror finish, so having a dremel handy and some very fine sandpaper or jeweler's polish is a must ($40 in polish from Lowes or Home Depot)

, Regulators do just what the name implies; they regulate the air going to the valve of the marker to a set pressure so that all of the gas the reaches the valve is a consistent pressure. Inconsistency is a major problem, especially if using CO2 instead of compressed air or nitrogen. The regulator alleviates this problem. Every shot will have roughly the same amount of air or CO2 behind it, thereby making the marker more consistent, accurate, and efficient. Regulators are one of the best upgrades for any paintball marker. Regulators can be installed via either vertical adapter or to the bottom of the grip where the air source adapter is located, a good regulator can go for anywhere between $50 and $150. I'd recommend staying away from the CP regulators for something made by Dye, AKA, Eclipse, WGP, or Bob Long.

, Without an electronic eye sensor to the Tippmann a fast loader will be the only way to be relatively sure that the gun will not fire with a ball half in the chamber. A good electric hopper will be roughly $150 up to $300 depending on your style. Luckily, this hopper can go with you to any other paintball gun.


The cyclone feed system by Tippmann uses air or CO2 when the gun is fired to spin a wheel at the bottom of the hopper and load as many as 20 paintballs per second into the marker.
Many electronic hoppers are available that range in price from $20 to $150 and can load from ten to 35 balls per second. The better ones will have higher feed rates and will not run continuously, but will be activated by sound or will have infrared ""eyes"" that see when paintballs need to be loaded so that they only turn on when they are needed. This allows for longer battery life and for less noise coming from each individual player.

Know your team.,
Know what the other team has.,
Set up a game plan.,
Attack hard!,
Set a Trap.,
If you win the game...change the plan for the next game.,
Always protect the guy who invited you, or paid for you, if they're on your team.

",How to Win a Recreational Paintball Game," Understand your strengths and weaknesses. If your team doesn't have a strong sniper, you must go on the attack, and take the other team out. If your team has strong snipers, then set up traps, where when the other team comes into a zone you have people shooting from all directions, even experiment with your positions to see find your best two more example if any team member thinks it would be too likely to get tagged in the middle of the paintball war and it is too risky if they get noticed then being a sniper might be a better choice. The second example is if any team member thinks ""Oh, who would want to mess with this person in the middle of the field"", then go for Infantry, Rifleman, Gunner, Guard, Patrol or Scout, these two examples are found out from experience and practice so this may take some practice at paintball to realize this type of suggestion. Please keep in mind that the more noticeable you are, the more prone you are to get tagged; things like sound, improper camouflage,bright colors,radios,loud music,some times you're better off keeping it to your self then saying it to others think of it it's a better choice to keep it to your self about reloading then to yell cover me reloading in case of snipers or other opponents that find you compared to not being noticed from keeping it to self;
, At the beginning of the game, when choosing teams, notice what type of weaponry the other team has. Notice the key players (these are usually the leaders of the teams) and what they have with them. Notice ammo supply that the key players have. You must be very observant!but don't rudely stare at them because then they will notice you and tag you remember to consider the weaknesses in tactics of both your opponents action and weapon for example if there's a whole bunch of opponents you don't use your paintball gun what you use is a paintball grenade, if you think someone is about to paint grenade you or tag you tag them fast before they get a chance

, Figure out where you can make your strong side. Plan for attacks. You must hope for the best, but plan for the worst. Have an attack squad, and a defense squad. For advanced teams, you can make a game plan after the game starts. In order to do this, have 2 or so people sprint forward and take cover. Find out where the other team is going. Then they come back tell the team. Then your team can attack the weak side of the other team. You must be fast, and think quickly.

, Once you start, don't turn back. You can change the plan, but don't give up. The rule""the best defense is a good attack"" works very well in this game.remember you cannot turn back once your hooked to an opponent you can only turn back when the player is not noticed by the opponent do not forget to add your solutions to the issues with your teams issues and vulnerabilities

, If you play in the woods, wear a brightly colored T-Shirt when you arrive. Then after you go in to the field, put on a dark colored or camouflage jacket. Hang your brightly colored shirt so that it looks like you are hiding badly. Conceal yourself nearby. When someone approaches and starts shooting at your shirt, spring the trap! It's also super sneaky to bury yourself with debris.remember to make the traps as hidden as possible

, Even slightly, because the other team knows what you did and will be expecting it in the next game. But if you lose, learn what went wrong. Take the mistakes, and ask the people who got shot if they could survive if they repeated their tasks.

Know the rules.,
Be fit.,
Choose clothing colors that do not resemble or clash with the netball teams.,
Wear appropriate shoes.,
Bring a drink bottle.,
Buy your own whistle.,
Consider contact lenses if you wear glasses.",How to Be a Netball Umpire1," Most likely you have been chosen to umpire because your knowledge of the rules is clear. Some clubs may make you take a test to display this knowledge. Check with your club's procedures first. For your own sake, brush up on the rules before the season begins. For the occasions when you are unsure as to rules at any time during the netball season, prepare a list of people you can contact quickly to ask for advice. (Keep your mobile phone handy.);
, It is important to have a good level of fitness. Maintain your level of activity through regular exercise. Reduce consumption of cigarettes, alcohol and fatty food if you haven't done so already - being an umpire is physically draining and you will need good energy levels.

, An umpire needs to be easily differentiated from the teams; once you know their colors, choose accordingly (or see ""Tips"" for club provision of clothing).

, Buy shoes suitable for wearing on court. The same shoes worn by the players will be ideal. Ask them if you're not sure where to buy them from. Jogging shoes or tennis shoes will also work well.

, You'll be keeping active during the game; having your own supply placed somewhere handy, or wearing it, is a sensible precaution.

, This is hygienic and sensible. Tie it on a lanyard or string for hanging around your neck. It's a good idea to include a name label in case you misplace it during a match.

, The constant movement can be a problem if you wear glasses. Do not go without contacts; this risks having your judgment called into question if someone thinks you cannot ""see properly"".

Identify the reason why you don't feature for the starting eleven.,
Consider your position on the field.,
Assess your level of play.",How to Attain Regular Play As a Soccer Substitute1," Figure out whether there's a certain skill you lack, and if so, focus on improving that skill or working around it. For example, if you can't head the ball, work with your coach to improve, or get good enough at trapping the ball with your chest or knees so that you don't have to head it.


Age might be a factor. This is because young players are not as experienced as their older counterparts as they haven't played many games as yet.;
, Your playing time might be determined by the position you play. Generally, substitute defenders and goalkeepers lack playtime. An experienced defender or a dominant goalie is difficult to displace. If there's someone on your team who is better than you at your position, become a better player than them to win playing time. Or consider trying out a different position that has less competition on your team - if you become good at this position, it might be easier for you to get more playing time.

, Are you good enough? Can you fit in the team? Can your teammates rely on you? If not, then you don't deserve first team play. Work to improve your playing before you worry about becoming a starter.

Do personal preparation prior to the match where possible.,
Know the whereabouts of the First Aid kit and how to use it.",How to Be a Netball Umpire2," Do some stretches to warm up, and take a chance to say hello to the players. It is especially important to introduce yourself to players of a team you're not familiar with.

, If you are not proficient in First Aid, ensure that somebody present is and remains present throughout the match (for example, a coach).

"
"
Check the players for the following:


Proper uniform
Proper shoes
Bibs on properly (right colors, tied on properly, etc.),
Check that the player's fingernails are cut short.,
Ensure that every player has removed all jewellery prior to play.,
Check for any other extruding objects that might cause harm to the player or other players during the game.",How to Be a Netball Umpire3,"
Need for better team identification - if you're having trouble telling the teams apart, now is the time to get new bibs onto one of the teams

, No gloves or Band-Aids™/sticking tape over the nails are permitted; short means short.

, This means: no necklaces, no rings, no earrings. A Medic-Alert bracelet is the only exception.

, Request removal of any such items.

"
"
Collect the official score card prior to the game.,
Speak loudly and clearly.,
Blow your whistle clearly.,
Keep up with the players.",How to Be a Netball Umpire4," It is your responsibility to keep this accurately.

, Whenever you need to address the teams, use a clear voice that carries. Practice at home first! It is also really important to speak with confidence; there will be many times when your call will be questioned and you must feel confident about your judgment.

, When you need to blow the whistle, be sure to blow it with one clear, sharp blast. It must be audible to the players and it must be quick. Practice at home.

, This is where fitness is essential; to be able to make accurate judgment calls, you must keep with the action whilst not getting in the way of the action. This can take practice, but with time you'll improve.

Watch more achieved professionals.,
Learn from your teammates.,
Have good relations with teammates.,
Talk to your coach.",How to Attain Regular Play As a Soccer Substitute2," This helps in gaining skills on the field, but more importantly, it will give you a much better idea of the flow and feel of a high-quality game. Pay special attention to players in your position to understand how you should respond in any situation. For goalkeepers, watch Manuel Neuer or Iker Casillas. For central defenders, you may learn from Thiago Silva or Sergio Ramos. For wing backs, you may learn from Philip Lahm or Fabio Coentrão. For midfielders, you may observe Luka Modric or Andres Iniesta. For wingers, learn from Neymar Jr. or Gareth Bale. For forwards, learn from Leo Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.

, Watch fellow team mates who are in the starting lineup during your training sessions. Learn from how they play and how they improve in general. Compete against them in practice and work hard to improve. If you can figure out their strengths and skills that make them better than you, try to practice these strengths and skills so that you can be as good as them.

, This improves coordination with other players, which is key for a regular team player and will help your teamwork on the field. Also through this, you get the impression of a real game situation.

, Learn from him about first team play and any other important things that will improve your chances. Ask your coach where your greatest weaknesses are, and ask for advice on improving in those areas. In addition to getting some helpful advice, this will show your coach how dedicated you are to improving, which will make him more likely to reward your efforts with playing time.

Take all training sessions seriously.,
Perfect your personal game by training on your own occasionally.,

Be disciplined.,
Take advantage of all the playing time you get.,
The more you improve, the more you'll get to play.",How to Attain Regular Play As a Soccer Substitute3," Show up on time or early, dressed and ready to play. Ensure you follow instructions and take part in the various field activities. Rather than chatting with your teammates, pay attention when your coach is talking, and work hard throughout practice to improve your skills, ball handling, field play, and conditioning. Take practice as seriously as you take games, and you'll see noticeable results in your playing.

, Identify areas you need to improve on and work on them yourself. For example, if you struggle to control the ball in the air, practice juggling for fifteen minutes each night. Pick small, easily identifiable skills and work to improve them on your own.

, Confidence is a major factor in any regular player. If you believe in yourself, then your team will definitely believe in you. This will also become evident in the way you play: you will become more aggressive and dominant a player as your confidence increases.

, Take the game seriously, and work hard both on and off the field. In addition to improving your play, this gives your coach or manager a good impression of a good player.

, If you are accorded a few minutes of play on a match day, do your best for as long as you're on the field. Give it your all and work to impress your coach, but more importantly, try to help your team in any way you can. Work with your teammates rather than trying to show off your skills with the ball. And if you can, it never hurts to please the fans. Being a fan favorite can be a very big advantage.

, Strive to be at your best and you will experience that 90 minutes eventually.

Ask your friends.,
Post flyers.,
Post online.,
Schedule regular practice.,
Seek out sponsorship.,
Pay entry fees.,
Wear protective gear.,
Prepare your gun.,
Get CO2 tanks.",How to Start a Paintball Team," The most obvious place to start in your search for teammates is among your friends. Start with the people you know play paintball.


Paintball is relatively easy to learn and many people consider it fun so consider asking people who don’t currently play if they’d like to start.;
, Posting flyers may be an antiquated way to broadcast a message but it can be very effective, especially if you’re trying to reach a specific audience like people with paintball experience.


Make it colorful and creative to catch the eye of passers-by. If you can, include a picture of a paintball gun or something similar to immediately indicate the type of team you’re building.
Make sure you get approval if you’re going to post at a private business, in a high school, college or at the field. Many of these places will have corkboards just for this purpose that are free to use. Nonetheless, it’s always a good idea to check if you need approval.

, Social media and paintball-specific web forums are a great way to communicate with a large number of people and build your team.


Include information about where you plan to play, the price of tournament admission and other related costs, and your own level of experience.
If your team already has a logo and name, include it with your post to catch the attention of potential players.
Use a catchy but straightforward title for your posting like “Join my paintball team!”

, The teams that you compete against in tournaments will likely have prior experience so you may not fare particularly well if you just show up and wing it. Practice will improve your team’s skills and result in more victories.


It’s best to practice at the field where you will be competing in tournaments. However, you can also practice in an open field, a wooded area or a spacious backyard.
Try to pick a regular time that works for all of your teammates. This will help avoid scheduling conflicts and make sure you can practice with everyone there as often as possible.
Work on your strategy and teamwork during practice. Consider how you’ll provide cover for each other and how you’ll concentrate your efforts on specific parts of the battlefield., Ask local businesses in your area if they are interested in sponsoring your team. This will likely involve wearing patch with the businesses logo on your uniforms.


When speaking with a potential sponsor, start with something simple like “My friends and I are starting a paintball team and are seeking sponsorship. Would you be interested?”
Try to emphasize that a lot of people will attend tournaments to show that the advertisements will be effective.
Find other teams that have received sponsorship to get an idea of what kinds of businesses might be interested. Look for teams in other sports like soccer or basketball that have received sponsorship and see if those businesses would like to add another team.

, The paintball field will definitely require payment for you to play there and may have additional dues related to tournament play. Make sure you know these costs ahead of time and make your teammates aware of them.

, The impact of a paintball can be painful and even dangerous. Making sure you and your team have all of the protective gear you need is both a good idea and most likely a requirement at most commercial paintball fields.


Paint splatter is very dangerous for the eyes so the most essential equipment is a mask. Paintball masks are designed to provide protection to the entire face while allowing enough room so you can still wear glasses, if you need them. The price of a mask will typically range from $15 to $50 and can be found at most sporting goods stores.You’ll want to wear a long sleeve shirt and long pants so that no skin is exposed. While this is enough for many players, some will wear additional layers of clothing to provide additional protection.
A paintball on the bare knuckles can be painful and cause injury so wear protective gloves. Paintball gloves are typically fingerless to make it easier to pull the trigger.A paintball to the neck can be very painful so wear a scarf. Some players wear a turtle neck sweater instead.

, Your paintball gun is your most important piece of equipment and you have to make sure it’s operating properly before each match.


Take practice shots before each match to ensure that the gun is shooting straight and that it’s assembled properly.
Use a chronograph to measure the velocity of paintballs leaving the gun. Many paintball fields will require that guns have maximum velocity of 300 feet per second to avoid injuries.Get enough paintballs. You’ll want to bring at least 800 paintballs per player for a tournament match.

, Carbon Dioxide or CO2 will serve as the gunpowder for your paintball gun. Be sure that your tank is at least half-full before every match. You can find CO2 tanks at most sporting goods stores.


The ideal tank will hold between 12 and 20 ounces or between 340 and 570 grams.

Make sure your whole team knows the signs it doesn't matter if you know every sign in the book but they don't.,
I have eyes on.,
Move to cover.,
Stop- hold hand up in the air with your hand opened.,Regroup- twirl your pointer finger around up in the air that means your team should ""fall in"" from cover and prepare to move

,
Move way.,
Before the game it is a good idea to give each guy a job if you have ten guys you should have a sign that tells two (or more) predetermined people to attempt a flank.

,
It can be a good idea (if a teammate is close by) to tap your teammate on the shoulder to be sure he gets the order.

,Be sure that your team knows that they should not talk (with the exceptions of having walkie talkies or you know no one is nearby) unless you are less than three feet away

",How to Use Different Hand Signals While Playing Paint Ball," Here are some suggested hand signals you could use while playing paint ball;
, this means you have spotted an enemy, put your pointer and middle fingers to your eyes and then point them towards the ""enemy"" that you spotted.

, hold a fist up in the air your team should crouch lay down or crawl to cover.

, everybody should stop and crouch down aiming in different positions.

,, hold your pointer and your middle fingers to together and point in a direction (left right ect.).

When you're first starting out, pick something relatively cheap, versatile, and lightweight, so you can get some experience and find out whether or not you want to upgrade your gear later.


Tippmann 98 Custom guns or Brass Eagle Strikers are lightweight, effective, and generally easy to handle for beginners. You'll also want to get a 200 round hopper for ammunition.
Experienced players use different guns for ""woodsball"" or ""tourney"" style play, so sometimes the best bet is to head out to a field and rent some equipment to try out the different styles and see what you like before you buy something.;
, To power paintball guns, CO2, air, and nitro compresses are all commonly used. CO2 tanks are usually recommended for the first time player, because they're much easier to buy and fill cheaply.


As you get more experienced, you may want to invest in an air tank, which is not temperature sensitive. This has the added benefit of consistent speed and distance in your shots.

, Buy armour. Every paintball facility will sell or give armour. Make sure you have as much as you can to play safe. Eye and face protection are essential to paintball safety. Other armor is often used, though it can be somewhat uncomfortable, and unnecessary the more you play. Paintball shot usually leaves a medium size bruise and a small welt. Protective gear commonly used in paintball includes:


Padded gloves
Full head-shield mask
Knee and elbow pads
Long, dark pants and shirts

, If you plan on playing paintball regularly, a good set of goggles is an important investment. You can always try out other guns besides the rentals, but it's best to have your own goggles as soon as possible, so you're always ready to play.


Thermal goggles are heat resistant, and won't fog up while you're running around, making them a good investment. If you can't see because your goggles are fogging, you will not be able to enjoy playing. If the rental goggles you get are scratched and dirty, ask for a clear set.
Never play paintball without goggles. While paintballs may only hurt a little bit when you get hit in the leg, it can be devastating to your eye. Always wear goggles when you play.

, Once you've got your paintball gun and gear, you'll need something to shoot. Most paint fields won't sell paint (although some do), so it's important to load up before you head out with your friends.


Spend a little extra on paint and you'll hit more of what you shoot at. Well-made paintballs tend to be more accurate and fly more true than cheaper paint, which can pop in the tube and melt more easily.
Buying paintballs in larger quantities (such as 2,000) is usually cheaper per paintball than buying in smaller quantities (such as 500).

, Paintball is definitely a hobby for gear-heads. There are lots of less essential paintball gear items that you can get, which aren't necessary but are a lot of fun to get. There are many things you can get, talk to experienced players, and keep an eye out for ways to outfit yourself.


Ammo belts are available that hold between 700 and 1,000 paintballs.
Paintball attire such as company brand name jerseys and pants.
Military gear, including anything camouflage.
Tank covers, or barrel bags are also nice and handy.

, Practice looking down the barrel and aiming your paintball gun, and take the gun into a safe location with a solid backstop and take a couple shots to get used to the accuracy.


If you have a vertical feed gun, look down the right or left side of the barrel to aim. Even though it looks cool, don't shoot from the hip. Do not just pull the trigger and watch the balls fly. AIM from the shoulder and correct your aim as you shoot.
Learn how accurate your gun is at distance. Most guns will be accurate at 50 feet (15.2 m). If you are farther than 50 feet (15.2 m) you may be less accurate than someone who plays PB well, has a better gun, and has better paint. If you have bad accuracy over 50 feet (15.2 m), get closer so you can make up for it.

, When you run out of ammo, you'll need to be able to load it up again quickly to keep firing when you're playing. Practice unloading and reloading your paintball gun regularly so you can stay in the fight.


Open up your new load of paintballs before you shoot the last of what's in your hopper. This helps keep your opponents' heads down while you reload.
Standard loaders need to be opened up, which you'll usually want to do before you reach for a new load of paintballs. Opening the lid can be difficult without your hands free.
Some paintball guns have ""speed-feeds"" which have no lids and are super-fast to reload. It's good to learn the old-fashioned way, but go for a newer speed-feed if you want to invest.

, Being a crack shot from a standing or kneeling position is one thing, but being able to shoot on the move will help you become a great paintball player. When you've got your gun and have practiced operating and loading it, practice moving safely with your gun, and firing while you move.


Practice moving side to side, and keeping your gun at a steady level. Set up some cans or other targets to strafe as you run.
Only practice in safe areas with a backdrop. The backyard's probably not the best idea. Find a place where you can set up some cans to practice firing while you move.

, Stealth is one of the most essential parts of being a good paintballer. It's not all running and gunning, heading straight into the belly of the beast and coming out having tagged all your opponents. That'll only work some of the time. Learn to hide and to blend in with your surroundings as well.


Run with your legs flexed, your head down, and your body as tight in as possible. The more you run around flailing about, the more exposed you'll be to enemy fire.
Practice finding cover and making yourself as small as possible. Practice firing behind cover, popping out for minute to shoot, then hiding again.

, Get a barrel squeegee, gun oil, and valve o-rings to replace parts as necessary. All of these items should come with instructions so you should be able to figure out what to do.


A clean barrel is an accurate barrel. Squeegee the barrel regularly to keep excess paint gunk from clogging it up. If you continue to play paintball you will want to buy a squeegee to help clean your gun.
If you can, check your barrel between games to make sure it's clean. If you see spray spewing from your barrel, you know it's dirty and won't shoot straight. Clean it or ask someone how to.

, Paintball can't be played alone. It requires a community, or at least a few friends that you an team up with to take on other teams in your area for fun. If you want to know something specific about paintball, you'll have a willing group of people to ask.


Hang out at local paintball fields to meet people if you don't have any paintball friends. Ask around if there are any open teams, or teams that you might join to learn more.
Lots of paintballers talk a big game, but it's supposed to be fun, and it won't take long before you feel like an experienced player. Don't let yourself be intimidated by more experienced guys.

, So the game has started and you will be feeling a lot of adrenaline and may be a bit scared. Shake those nerves off and get ready to play., Your first task will be finding a place that you can regularly play paintball. Urban areas typically have indoor fields and obstacle courses that you can pay to play at, while rural areas will often have outdoor parks in which you can paintball with your friends. All paintball facilities will have different rates, fees, and features, so explore what's available in your area to learn more.


If you don't have access to a paintball facility in your area, it's perfectly fine to paintball on private property, if you choose. Read this article to learn more about setting up your own paintball facility.

, All paintball fields are different, usually set up with a variety of hiding places, alleys, barrels, bins, and other things that you can use to your advantage. Likewise, there will usually be big open places where you won't want to find yourself without protection.


Before the game starts, or just after you get on the field, make sure to walk around the facility a bit and get a sense of the lay of the land. Pay particularly close attention to good hiding areas you might want to bunker down in with your team.
While you're playing, keep your head up as much as possible. Watch for signs of motion. Watch for the glinting light of your enemies helmets as they flash in the sun. Listen for signs of movement. Listen to them talking. Be aware.

, Bad paintballers start shooting the second they run onto the field and don't stop until they're totally out of ammunition. While some paintball guns are more accurate than others, even the best of them aren't super-accurate. Wait until you've got a smart shot, and don't just spray paint all over the field.Different players have different philosophies. You came to play and shoot after all, so let 'er rip if you feel the need. Lay down some suppressing fire to guard your buddies.

, Keep moving, to avoid getting caught in a compromising position, but also keep an eye out for good places your team might be able to guard and stay safe in. Look for big bunkers that you can hide in and lay down fire from. Look for places you'll be safe for a while, to avoid running around like a chicken with your head cut off.Don't run aimlessly. Find a place to go, then move. Practice firing a few shots before you run somewhere, then run quickly and get to where you're going fast.

, Paintball can get pretty intense. Make sure to take deep breaths and calm yourself down, or your panic can cause you to make mistakes. Listen closely, watch the other players to follow instructions and go with the flow of the game. And have fun.


Don't worry too much about getting hit. The first time you get hit, it will sting for a split second and may even surprise you, but it does not hurt that bad. It is also a good incentive to make sure you keep cover.

, A good paintball team talks, verbally and non-verbally. Establish different roles in your team, helping to guard the other players, or find new territory, or go out on recon missions to shoot at other guys. Depending on how you're playing, you might have a more specific objective in mind, so listen up and keep talking so you play well as a team.Listen to your instructor. Just before your game, you may have an instructor explain the objective and useful ways to win. Listen carefully as they do know what they are talking about.
Coordinate attacks and time them well. Split up into a few groups and attack your opponents from two angles at once to pin them down and go in for the kill.
Pay attention to the more experienced players to come up with a good strategy, but chip in when you feel like you've got an idea of your own. If it's good, you'll be helping the team.

Always maintain a balanced platform.,
Stand facing your bunker.,
Figure out where your opponent is.,
Quickly lean out of your bunker so that only about half of your head, your hands that are holding your marker, and the marker itself is exposed.,
As soon as your opponent's balls either fly past or hit your bunker, snap out again and repeat.

,If the snapping is more drawn out than five or ten seconds, as soon as your opponent goes behind his bunker, quickly move to another bunker to get a better shot on him

",How to Snap Shoot in Paintball," While this does not necessarily mean standing athletically with feet at shoulder-width, as this can be difficult in a tournament or high-pressure scenario, you do want to prevent yourself from falling over, or even exposing yourself any more than you need to.;
, Hold your gun up, with your air tank rested against your shoulder (not ON your shoulder), possibly on your bicep. Tuck your elbows in, so that both your elbows face the ground. While you may have to bend your wrist more than you are used to, this is necessary to avoid exposing your arm. Hold your gun in front of your face so that you are looking down the barrel of your gun, with the gun more or less between your eyes.

, Often your opponent may be posted on you, meaning he is looking out from his bunker, watching yours in wait for you to come out. If you are snapping out from the right side of your bunker, face more to the right so that you will be doing a slight lean forward and can avoid awkwardly leaning to the side (this may vary, depending on the comfort and the experience of the player) also, when switching to the opposite side of your bunker, you should also consider switching your gun to the other hand. If you're going to snap left, then have your left hand out in front, and vice versa.

, Shoot a few balls out at your opponent and snap back into your bunker.

Wear all appropriate safety equipment (headgear, barrel bag, barrel sleeve, etc.).,
Play at a certified course with responsible refs and strict rules.,
Never shoot at wildlife or stray domestic animals however irritating they may be.,
Watch out for natural hazards (roots, animals, cliffs, etc.,
Have your CO2 tank inspected as recommended by the manufacturer.,
Keep eyes away from the air release valve.

,
Wear a cup/jock strap, if you are a male.,
Do not necessarily believe the 'facts' that paintball is safer than tennis or bowling.,
Goggles must be worn anytime you're on the field of play or in a place where guns are being fired in unsafe condition.,
Barrel bags and barrel plugs stop balls from being shot out of the gun.,
Do not overshoot people.,
Do not shoot people up close.,
Know your gear.,
Unscrewing your HPA or CO2 bottle from your gun takes about 3-4 full turns.,
Do not shoot anything except paint balls or practice balls.

,
Do not shoot at anyone not wearing proper paintball goggles.",How to Play Paintball Safely," Purchase your own equipment or use the equipment provided by the event organizer. If you're not happy with the safety equipment provided, don't participate. The paintball Mask is the most important piece of equipment. You must always wear your mask when on the field. Do not remove it on the field at any time, even if it fogs up. If your mask fogs up, call yourself out, and ask for a ref to escort you to the deadbox. Keep everything on until everyone is in and the barrels are plugged. It could cause serious injury.;
, This will increase your chance of NOT being hurt in paintball.

, That crow that is blowing your cover, might give away an enemy position later so leave it alone! Cruelty to animals is illegal. Paintball should not be played in areas where wildlife is protected or where rare plants or trees grow.

,).

, If the nozzle comes off, there is a high risk of serious injury and/or death.

,, This will help prevent pain, if hit.

, Paintball is a young extreme sport and has no mechanism in place for proper reporting of paintball accidents. So we have no statistics, therefore there must be no injuries, has been the idea so far. In reality, field owners frequently admit to the increase in injury over the past three years. You are responsible for your safety and that of the others around you.

, A paintball travels at 200fps (feet per second) and can do serious damage to your body. Without proper goggle safety, you can lose an eye. Or worse, you can shoot someone else's eye out because you're too lazy to be safe.

, With the increase in electronic triggers that can be fired with even a light touch, barrel safety using plugs and condoms is vital. Accidental triggering happens ALL the time even among veteran players. When you are not in the game, you must put the barrel condom or plug into the barrel. Even if the gun is not loaded, or there is no air in the air tank. Again, how YOU play affects many other people, not just by being safe, but also by being a good example to others. If you do NOT use a plug or condom because you know the gun is unloaded, someone else may decide to copy you except his gun may be loaded. Be smart. Keep our sport safe!

, Overshooting occurs when you shoot someone more times than needed. Not only is this behavior reserved for mules, it also can be dangerous. Often players make the excuse that the overshot player was cheating and wouldn't call himself out. This may be true, but as often if not more often, the player who's being shot at is afraid to leave cover. It's not appropriate for a 12 year old kid to be cowering in cover, while some 28yr old pounds his position like an insane person because he is certain the kid is cheating and not coming out even though he was hit. Don't overshoot. It takes the fun out of playing paintball.

, If you're in the heat of it, things can get hard fast and sometimes close. That's okay, it's paintball. But if you come up on someone and shoot him from point blank instead of calling out Surrender first, then you're messed up. Shout out surrender, it's much more satisfying and if they don't surrender IMMEDIATELY shoot them once or twice and apologize for shooting at them so close. This is paintball, and it's supposed to be about FUN. Shooting someone at very close range is not fun, it's inflicting pain and physical damage. (If you shoot someone close range a lot of times, they'll be hating you after the game; if you make them surrender, you can all laugh and be friends after the game because you made him JUMP! and it was pretty funny.)

, Read the manual if you own your own gear. It's easy to read, and will teach you how to take care of your gear. Paintball uses gear that is heavy duty, not kids toys at all. Treat your gear with respect.

, If you are turning the bottle more than 4-5 turns, you must stop and inspect the bottle. The valve of a HPA or CO2 bottle holds back up to 4500 pounds per square inch of pressure, if you are unscrewing the valve by accident, you will soon have a murderous rocket in your hand that will fly out and destroy things and kill people. This is serious. There were two sad deaths in 2005 because of bottle flying off and striking people. One was a mother, the other a young player. Learn how to properly remove your bottle and pay attention.an exemption to the 4-5 full turns is a paintball gun like the Tippman 98 custom which says on the owners manual to unscrew it 3/4 turns then use up the rest of the gas and before you unscrew the air tank mark it with paint just a thin line

,, If you're on the field and you see someone without goggles on, yell at them to put them on and go make sure.

"
"
You will start in an area called ""The Break Area"".,
The referee will shout ""Ten seconds in 3, 2, 1 ...,
Sprint as fast as you can to your designated bunker and take cover, your teammates will provide some cover.,
When you're shooting keep most of your body BEHIND the bunker.,
You also want to move around a little.,
If you get hit, stop shooting, put your gun in the air and shout ""I'm hit!""",How to Play Speedball," There you will determine with your team where each player will go. Bunkers are almost always inflated, not solid. There are certain names that refer to each bunker. First is the ""Tombstone"" bunker; it looks like a tombstone. The next bunker is the ""Soda Can"" bunker. There are two types of soda can bunkers: Lay Down or Stand Up. The soda can bunker looks like a soda can. A lay down soda can looks like a soda can on its side, a stand up soda can looks like a soda can standing up. Next is the ""Dorito"" bunker. This bunker looks like a pyramid. There is also a series of bunkers called the ""Snake"". These are short, long bunkers that form a snake - like shape often having ""knuckles"" which are made up of either tombstones or bricks. In X-Ball or Millennium there is also a large X or M bunker in the middle of the field. Finally there is the ""Car Wash"" bunker. These bunkers look like a larger can cut in half.;
, Ten seconds!"" The referee will count to ten in his head. Usually, people on your team will be counting down out loud; you can do this if you want to. Those ten seconds are probably the most terrifying seconds of the game. After the ten seconds, the referee will shout ""GO, GO, GO!""

, You will definitely want to shoot off the break because everyone is moving and you will have a good chance to hit someone. The start of the game is loud and fast. Don't Panic

, Stick your head and gun out. Since the bunkers are inflatable and flexible, you can press your gun and body into the bunker. Only do short pops unless you know that you're clear.

, When you're moving, put your head down, gun up, shoot and run. This may sound difficult, but with some practice you will get the hang of this. Remember that you only have about 3 seconds or less to get to your next bunker. This if figured by the opponent that you are shooting at will take about 1 second to move back into his bunker, 1 second to figure out where you were shooting at him from, and the last second to ""pop"" back out. In that 3 seconds you should be in your next bunker and ready to shoot. Bend your knees, not your back; that way you'll be lower but you'll have better sight of the field and where you are shooting. When you ""snap"" out its all in the waist and mid section. Work on your core and cardio when training to play.

, or if you get hit but don't feel it, the referee may give you a paint check and either call you out or keep you in. Note: Always check yourself for paint before calling yourself out. Sometimes you will get hit and the ball won't break. If that happens, you're still in. Walk off the nearest side of the field after getting out.

Buy or obtain a CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) tank of 12–20 ounces (340–570 g) or HPA- 4500/3000 psi (there are many sizes- cu.,
Find a scarf and wear it!,
Find some sort of hat to wear under your mask.,
Prepare yourself with at least 800 paintballs in pods, that is if you are not the trigger-happy type of paintballer.,
Clean your marker and get it in peak firing condition.,
Make sure that your marker is firing properly before the game, and you are correctly dressed with padded/camouflage clothing, boots with good support, and a very nicely fitting mask!

,
Stretch your muscles too.,
Make sure your team is there.,
Always get your gun chronoed.",How to Prepare for a Paintball Game," in.) and make sure they are over half full before you go onto the field. You don't want to be left in a bunker with no CO2 or air and your enemy approaching, being bunkered hurts bad.;
, It will help protect you from throat or neck shots.

, This absorbs sweat so your mask doesn't fog up, and you don't get paint in your hair if you get shot in the head.

, You may not want to carry 4-6 full pods of paint because this can be heavy, I suggest putting a squeegee and a pack of window wipes to clean your mask in at least one pod. These are usually cheap containers that store your paintballs while you are on the field, best used with a harness to hold the pods, keeping your hands free without having to worry about carrying pods as well as a marker.

, You don't want a marker that doesn't fire well on the field. If you can, observe your playing field, the better you know the field the better you will play! Doing this will give you a chance to make a mental note of the advantage points.

,, It is bad if you get a cramp in the middle of the paintball battle.

, If it's a three man speedball game then make sure you bring two other people.

, A chronograph is an instrument which checks the velocity your marker is firing at. If your velocity is too high, you could injure someone severely and this is against paintball etiquette.

Instead of buying a bunch of gear, rent some at a field that rents out gear to see how you like the game, then consider investing in your own stuff when you're ready.


When you arrive at a paintball center or field, you will be given a set of overalls, possibly body armour, a face mask, and a hopper. This is the container that holds the paintballs and feeds them into the paintball gun.
When you go out into the live fire zone to play your matches, you will be issued a paintball gun. The hopper will usually fit into the top of the gun, and there is a safety switch and a trigger on the gun. Then you're ready to play.;
, Paintball guns are operated with compressed air, which shoot marble-sized balls of paint at a high velocity. A good starter paintball gun usually costs anywhere between $100 and $150 dollars, but higher range models can be upward of $700.


The Tippmann A5 is recommended for beginners and newbies alike. If you don't like the styling on the Tippmann A5, look for a Kingman Spyder gun, such as the Spyder Pilot or Spyder Sonix. These guns are suggested to newer players for the fact of that they are quality, and aren't in the really pricey range.
Spend time with your gun, if you buy one. Learn to clean it and maintain it, to ensure that you'll get the most accurate shots when you're out on the field.

, Paintballs are capsules containing a non-toxic, bio-degradable, water-soluble dye with a gelatin outer shell. When players play against each other individually, each of them gets a unique color set of paintballs. When players play in teams, each team is assigned a unique paintball color. This is done to make it easy to identify the winning player or team.


Mostly, paint will be purchased directly from the arena where you play. If you want to play at other locations, you can buy bulk paintballs at most sporting goods stores.

, If you have your own paintball gun, it's important to familiarize yourself with the action and the range of the gun. Find a proper backstop and shoot your gun a few times to see how it aims and how quickly it shoots. Practice reloading and moving with your gun safely.


Make sure you take off your safety. It might sound stupid but even the best players sometimes forget. So make sure it's off the moment you hit the battlefield.
If your gun jams, make sure you yell out JAM! as loud as you can because if you don't yell and you try to fix it on the field, you're gonna get shot.
Don't flip your gun upside down! This is the cause of jamming and you losing all your paint balls.
Use two hands on you gun. One hand should be beside but not on the trigger. The other hand should be on the stock grip, ahead of the trigger but not too close to where the paint balls are coming out.

, At every paintball range, a proper mask and pair of goggles will be required. You won't be permitted to play without a paintball mask. If you don't have one, you can rent one and other safety gear at the paintball arena, while some players like to invest in their own.


Lots of paintball masks tend to fog up, making it difficult to see. Some players who play a lot like to buy ""no fog"" masks, which help you breathe easier and reduce the fogging that can happen in your mask.

, When you get hit with a paintball, it may leave a small bruise on your skin. It doesn't hurt much, but you'll feel it. The only required gear will usually be some kind of mask and possibly coveralls, but it's always a good idea to protect yourself.


Try to wear thick gloves when you play. It really hurts when you get hit in the knuckle or palm. The rest such as vests and pants are extras.Wear thick clothing, long sleeved shirts and pants every time you play paintball. Many outdoor paintball fields can be muddy, or full of brambles, so it's a good idea to wear protective clothing.
Men may wish to invest in an athletic cup, as well, although in some paintball pants there is a thick pad in the crotch to avoid having to buy one.

, Paintball game fields vary widely in size and layout. It can be played both indoors and outdoors, depending on where you live. Usually, a game field will have bunkers, tables, barrels, stacks of tires, and other types of cover placed throughout the field.


It's also possible to play on private property, or to set up your own paintball field if you've got some land to work with, but it's usually a good idea to find a paintball facility in your area when you're first starting out.

, When you get to the arena, you can pick the type of game you'll play, but a few basic rules will be enforced for all types of games. Most games of paintball are played between teams with a specific time limit, which may be projected on a wall visibly or marked with some kind of buzzer or countdown. Most games of paintball also involve one team trying to shoot as many players of the opposite team as possible. There are a variety of different games you can play, some of which are outlined in the next section.Keep your mask on at all times. There will be a safety zone where you are able to talk and remove your mask, and then the live fire zone, beyond which you must wear your goggles at all times.
Once you are out in the game zone, you may disengage the safety. After that's done, and the game begins, you're free to begin advancing and attacking the other team's players.

, When a paintball hits a player and bursts, they are out and must leave the field of play. Players should raise their hand to avoid being shot multiple times, after being hit once. If a paintball bounces off without leaving color on the player, they are free to carry on.


It's partially up to the player to self-report hits. It's a lot more fun if everyone plays by the rules. If you get shot, you're out.

, Paintballs are heavy and much slower than regular bullets, so they can drop significantly in height over a fairly small distance. When you shoot, you need to account for this. Aim a little higher than what you're shooting at, and ahead of targets that are moving.


A good place to aim is at around neck height, as you can ensure a fair kill and the drop of the paintball shouldn't be too far.
If a player is moving, make sure to aim ahead of them at where they are going to be, so that they run into the paintball. Also, imagine their neck to be a lot wider, as wide as their chest, as this is where the paintball will actually hit.
Don't aim at someone's head or face. Aside from being dangerous and unsportsmanlike, these hits typically do not count.
Some players like to shoot a lot, but paintballs run out faster than you think. And they're not free. Try to take smart shots, rather than spraying paint all over the field.

, When you are on the field, whether it be indoor or outdoors, you should keep moving quickly. Don't just wander around aimlessly. Pick a place to move, then move there, ducking low and moving quickly.


At the same time, it's good to know when to take cover and bunker up and wait. Don't run around like a chicken with its head cut off. Wait for your opponents to reveal themselves and make mistakes.

, Communication is key when playing on teams of any number. Coordinate attacks, movement, and strategy before hand, and listen to each other on the field


Get together with your team before you head onto the field and decide who will coordinate and what your hand signals, or call signs will be. If the team leader yells out, ""Duck duck goose in effect!"" you'll all know what that means.
Yelling out to move up or duck can and will easily reveal your position. Using hand signals and gestures are the best way to operate.

, Paintball games can happen pretty quickly, and you'll have to make lots of decisions pretty fast, or you might find yourself eliminated. Be quiet, and listen for tree branches snapping, gravel crunching, and echoes on cement. Breathe through your nose. Most masks will fog up when you breathe through your mouth. So crouch down look around, breathe easy and pay attention to your surroundings.


Be cautious, but have fun. Paintball should be more than running around, ducking from cover to cover and freaking out. Stay calm!

, Learning to creep around will make you a better paintballer. A game shouldn't be about running around like a chicken with your head cut off, or stalking around like the Terminator.


Try to move quickly between cover, running with your knees bent and your head down. You want to be as small as possible to avoid getting hit.
When you find cover, stay small. Keep your head down and pop up quickly to find a target. Pop back down, get ready, then pop back up to fire a few rounds. Aim carefully and be smart.

, It's easy to run out of paint on the field, which makes paintball a lot less fun. Depending on the size of your hopper, you may have plenty, but it's always a good idea to conserve your shots as much as possible, and only shoot when you have a good shot.


Don't just blast off shots every time you hear something. Wait until you see someone and have a clear shot, close enough to actually hit something.
Occasionally, you'll have to engage in a little running and gunning. If you know how to handle yourself, you'll be in a lot better shape on the paintball field. Practice moving side to side, and keeping your gun at a steady level.

, In this game mode, two teams compete to reach the other side of the map and return the other team's flag to their own base. If you are shot, you are out, as in normal play. If one team loses all of their players, the other team is free to walk the flag back.


Often, this game will be played with a time limit decided by both teams. Even if you eliminate everyone, you still have to navigate to the other side and find the flag and get it back to your side. This game requires teamwork and tactical speed.

, This is as nitty and gritty as it gets. In this game mode, two teams fight to eliminate all other players on the opposing team. The game ends when all of one team's players are out, or the time limit is reached.

, In this game mode, one team has one life each, and must Try to defend a fort from oncoming attackers within a fairly short time limit. The attackers, however, have unlimited respawns, so can wipe off the paint, return to their base, and then start their assault again. The game is over if the attackers infiltrate the base or the time limit is reached.

, This game mode is similar to Deathmatch, but there are no teams. Everyone fights everyone, and the game is over when only one person survives. It's usually common to form alliances in the middle of the game, which will obviously be broken somewhere down the line. This can be a lot of fun.

, All paintballing places will have a strict set of rules, which must be followed at all times for the safety of yourself and of others. For example, many places enforce a 3m rule. If you are closer than 3 meters to another player, you must not shoot them due to the dangers it poses.


Some paintballing places give bonus points based on good tactical skill or plays. There are countless variations and local games, but the basics are usually the same.

, Bend your knees to about a 100 degree angle and duck down at the same time. Now run while keeping your head up. It's hard but this is really useful in a spread out fire fight. (See Tips for more.)

, This is where you shoot while running. But here's the catch: try to keep your hands really steady. This will ensure you are still at least 60 to 75 % accurate with your shots and you are a fast moving target. (You should look to be getting about 80 to 90 % accuracy after a few months of training.)

, Say you are team leader and you walk 20 feet (6.1 m) in front of your team mates. Now the next man walks 20 feet (6.1 m) in front of you. And the last man walks 20 in front of him. And then keep going while scanning the environment.

, This is where you and a few other men each look in a different direction allowing 360 degree awareness!

, This is where you make as a small of a target of yourself as possible. Tuck your elbows to your ribs, crouch down and even tilt your marker about 20 to 30 degrees inward so the hopper covers some of your face. This will maximize your kill round and reduce your death count if used correctly.

, Peek out with roughly half of your face, so only one eye is looking where you want. In paintball, half of someone's face is a really small target to fire at.

Consider renting equipment.,
Put priority on your gun/marker: This is the most important piece in paintball, your gun.,
Get a mask: Your mask is your required safety gear at all fields and anywhere you play.,
Consider your hopper/loader, air source, and extras: These aren't as important as the paintball gun and mask, but without them you can't play.,
Buy protective gear if you want and can.,
Don't forget about paint.,
Find somewhere to play.,
Do your homework.,
Look into used equipment.",How to Play Paintball Cheaply," If you are only planning to play paintball a few times in your life, you might as well rent a gun and equipment. Especially if you are playing with good friends and family, try and split the money to play.


If you are playing frequently, buy a gun and it will pay for itself in no time at all.
Most paintball fields rent out all the equipment that you need, including CO2 or compressed air/nitrogen tanks, gun, hopper, and paintballs.
If your friends have spare items, consider borrowing too.;
, Also called a paintball marker.


If you are playing paintball every week then you might consider buying a high end gun from your local paintball shop. They will have drastically better guns than Walmart and a bigger selection.
If you are playing once a month or so then you might just rent or get a lower end gun.
If you are looking into purchasing your first gun/marker here are some good ideas.

The first paintball gun/marker that the majority of new players buy is the reliable Tippmann 98. It's easy to use and you don't have to worry about breaking it.
The Spyder brand of guns are a close second and are sometimes lighter and more comfortable.
You can get Spyder and Tippmann paintball markers at Walmart and other ""big box"" stores usually. You can get really cheap $20-60 guns at Walmart, but it's usually worth it to get something that's at least $100.



, Some entry level guns come with a mask, but the masks are usually not that great.


Before you decide to replace the mask, go play a game or two with it on and see if you like it. If not, spend around $25 to $45 on a decent mask.
The biggest upgrade you can get for your mask is a thermal or dual pane lens to keep the lens from fogging up. You don't want to be running around with a mask that you can't see out of or doesn't protect you well.
If you want to find a good deal on a mask, search online a little bit and find out where you can get a good mask.

Walmart, Target, and places that sell sporting goods will usually have a small selection of masks for the beginner.
If you know of a paintball-specific shop, try going there. You'll be able to try them on and there will be a larger selection.



,

The hopper, or loader, sits on top of the paintball gun and feeds the paintballs into the gun and the air source is what powers each shot.
Most of the cheaper guns just need a regular gravity-fed hopper and a paintball CO2 tank. Fields also require barrel covers (or barrel bags) that block paintballs from shooting out of the gun when you aren't playing on the field.
It's also nice to have an item to clean out your gun's barrel in case a paintball breaks in there such as a barrel swab or squeegee.

, All fields require a mask and a barrel bag, but there are optional pieces of protective gear you might want. This could include a neck protector, chest protector, knee and elbow pads, gloves, something to protect the top of your head, and a cup for guys.


These will make your first few times playing more enjoyable until you get over the sting of getting shot.
You might have gear at your house that you could repurpose for paintball such as an old hat for head protection, or using bike/skateboard pads.
If you want a chest protector look online. Chest protectors won't cover your kidneys, groin, and sometimes not even your back.

If you don't want to spend money on a chest protector, you can layer up on clothes you don't mind getting dirty.



, Your paint is very important, hence the name of the game, paintball.


There are many different kinds of paint but different paint works better in different guns.
To play for a day, if you're not speedballing and not using an automatic marker, about $35 will get you a box of 2000 balls, and will last you a while. The paint isn't really something you want to skimp on.
Cheap, poor quality, or old paint is not a good idea in paintball. It won't work as well because the shell is worn and will have dents in it, resulting in less accurate shots.

The balls could also break inside the barrel, which will then affect accuracy, and you'll likely have to clean it out.



, The field is another important aspect in paintball. You can't play paintball without a field.


If you are playing in the woods, make sure you have permission to play there.
If you are playing on an actual paintball field, make sure that you follow all of the field rules and ask the people working if you have any questions or concerns.
Playing in your locals woods or backyard is an option, too. Just make sure you're in a secluded area or have permission to play there.

, Do your research about your local fields and paintball shops. Find out how much is costs to play at the fields and look out for deals the fields have.


Some fields will have half off or free entry for, say, moms on mothers day or military veterans on Memorial day.
Local mom and pop, paintball-specific stores can be a huge help in getting you started playing and learning new things. They'll have the best equipment in stock and can fix your gun if it breaks down.

, Buying used gear can save you a lot of money. Make sure that you know what you are buying before you buy it and always test the item before buying it.


If there is a only a small difference in price, you might as well buy your stuff new.

The only problem you need to watch out for while buying used equipment is the condition and value of the product. You're usually getting what you pay for so keep that in mind.
Some worn equipment could easily break, making it a waste of money.


For masks, you might want to buy new or give the used mask a good cleaning and get a replacement lens. The lens can be scratched and weakened from prolonged usage.

Proceed in trying to eliminate every player on the opposing team.",How to Play Different Types of Paintball Games1,";
,

Some games can be played with ""Multiple Lives"". This means a player can be shot 1, 2, 3, or however many times you set up.

Go back to their starting point and can then proceed in re-entering the game if you are shot.
If a player is shot multiple times within a couple seconds of each other it still only counts as one life lost.
The player must go back to the starting point before another life can be lost. This makes games last longer and can also be interesting when you have to borrow paintballs from other players on your team because you run out.

Make sure the trench is deep enough to hold a person squatting down. Dig down about 3 to 3 1⁄2 feet (0.9 to 1.1 m). You may find there are rocks or even boulders that need to be moved. Since players will jump into a ditch rather quickly, it's best to remove these hazardous objects to a safer location.

Decide what kind of paintball you are going to play.,
Be sure you have the proper gear to protect yourself during play.,
A paintball mask should be your first purchase.,
For your first game, wear protective clothing.,
Also, acquire a barrel cover.,
Find a paintball marker that will suit your type of play.,
Paintballs - Often when playing on a field, you will only be allowed to use paintballs purchased from the field owner.,
CO2 or HPA is going to propel your paintball out of the marker itself.",How to Get Paintball Gear As a Beginner," There are two main forms of play, called ""Woodsball"" and ""Speedball"". They have various different subcategories and names, but the most basic distinction is this: Woodsball is played in the woods, Speedball is played with large inflatable bunkers, or man-made objects in a small court.;
, Safety always comes first in paintball.

, You are going to want to look for something that fits well, and provides an accurate amount of coverage. Since Masks tend to fog up over time, looking for a Thermal Lens will help you ensure that your first game is clear.

, A sweatshirt and sweatpants are advised. If you attend a professional field for your first time, which is recommended, then you will be required to chronograph your marker to an acceptable level, usually below 300 FPS. However, bruising may still result. Layers will help keep the damage from the impact to a minimum.

, Barrel plugs are not permitted, because if misfired, they can become a projectile.

, You want a durable marker that will not break down on you over time, and operates simply. Since you are just beginning, I would recommended looking at products produced by Tippmann Pneumatics, Spyder, or Smart Parts, because they have markers that run in the $100-$200 range.


Choose the type of marker you wish to use first. There are three main types: Electronic, Mechanical, and Pump. Electronic Markers use a computer board to make the gun fire faster . These can be adjusted to ""ramp"" or fire more than one ball per trigger pull. Mechanical markers operate on springs or other devices to fire one paintball at a time, except when a Response Trigger or E-Trigger is added to the marker itself. Pump markers have to be ""pumped"" every time a paintball is to be fired.








Smart Parts provides markers that are designed for ""Speedball"" play (Vibe, Ion), with a few notable exceptions (The SP8 and the SP1).






Spyder (Kingman USA) does both, with a woodsball line (MR1, MR2, MR3) and a speedball line (VS1, VS2, VS3). Spyder also produced the Pilot series, which was recently discontinued.






Meanwhile, Tippmann covers the ""Woodsball"" end with their 98 Custom, A5, and X7. Keep in mind that these are not the only markers available, and there are many fine products made by groups such as Worrgames Paintball Guns, Airgun Designs, Dye, Proto, and various other brands.







, However, if you have the choice of what kind of paint to use, do not put too much thought in to it for your first game. Most paintballs will do. Expect to pay $50 U.S. for one case of 2,000 rounds. Take into account what sort of weather you are playing in, some brands of paint do better in certain conditions than others. Visible Impact gets very fragile and breaks easily in winter play but is fine for warmer weather, whereas Monster does well in cold but not in heat.

, CO2 is cheaper, and is recommended for beginners. However, as you advance, you may want to consider upgrading to HPA, as it has much better accuracy, is easier to regulate, and will save you money in the long run if you have access to free compressed air fills.

Think about the compressed air system utilization in your shop.,
Start at the compressor itself.,
Ensure that moisture is removed at every point in the system where water can collect.",How to Keep Water Out of the Paint Gun When Auto Painting," What do you use it for? If yours is like most shops, you use it for everything you can. Is your shop comprised of separate rooms working off a single compressor or just one garage?


Water in the air lines isn't good for any pneumatic tool. But if you are on a tight budget, you can take measures to isolate the areas that absolutely must have dry, clean air to produce the desired results. However, this is a stopgap and will require constant monitoring to avoid contaminating your work.
Ideally, you will absolutely benefit from modifying your entire compressed air system. Regardless of what you do, the air supply cannot be too clean or dry. The investment in keeping water out of your paint gun will pay for itself many times over. The cost of having to repaint just one car would have paid for a thorough and efficient modification to your entire compressed air system.;
, The compressor is the heart of the system. By taking measures to produce clean, moisture-free air going into your plumbing, controlling downstream line moisture becomes easier to maintain.


Install a high-capacity bowl drain off the tank drain. Condensation naturally forms in the tank. This, and all system drains, should be checked and manually emptied at the start of every work day and immediately before shooting paint. Do it more often if conditions warrant.
Install a high-capacity drain/water separator and filter assembly in the air outlet to the shop supply plumbing. This is where most of the moisture removal occurs.
Ensure that the breather filter is clean and dry when you want to keep water out of paint guns. If necessary, consider upgrading the breather with a high-efficiency unit.

, Most plumbing has several to many points where water can accumulate. It doesn't take much collected water before the passing air picks it up, takes it to your tools and contaminates your work.


Install bowl drains at low points in the plumbing system.
Install bowl drains or filter/drain assemblies at every hose connection fitting, according to the jobs performed in that work area. Bowl drains would be fine for power tools. Filters are desirable for painting and pneumatic sanding tools.

Research what is available.,
Talk to a professional.,
Set a budget for the gun and gear.,
Choose a mechanical gun if you want to play casual games.,
Buy an electro-pneumatic gun for competitive play.,
Look for customization options.,
Hold the gun and judge how it feels.,
Test out how easy the gun is to use and adjust.,
Compare various sellers’ price for the gun you choose.",How to Choose a Paintball Gun," If you’re new to the sport, you may not have any idea how many options you have. Look at some sporting goods store sites to get an initial idea, and look at paintball specific retailers. Read reviews on various models to gauge which guns people tend to like most.


With so many choices on the market, it’s really not worth it to try and find the “best” gun, rather to find one that you think will suit you best.
You can gather a lot of information about various guns by going to online stores like Amazon or Ebay and reading product descriptions.
You can also visit specific paintball manufacturer’s sites to see their full selection and find out what advantages different guns offer.;
, If you are buying your first paintball gun, it’s likely that you don’t know quite what you need. If you have a paintball specific store or a paintball field with a pro shop, go there and talk to someone. They will be able to offer you a lot better information than you’ll find on your own.


If you go somewhere where people pay to play paintball that doesn’t sell guns, they may be more honest with you because they won’t be trying to sell you anything.
Ask friends who play often what gun they have and what they think of it.

, Paintball guns can range from $40 to upwards of $2000, so decide how much money you are willing to spend. For a basic gun that is of good quality, expect to pay around $200. Making a firm decision about how much you are willing to spend will help you narrow the focus when you choose a gun.Your budget should account for other necessary gear as well, which includes at least a mask, a CO2 or air tank, and a hopper. This will cost you $75 or more most of the time.
If you buy the gun with the lowest price you can find, you might be getting a low quality product. On the other hand, for most players, a top of the line gun is not necessary.

, These guns are lower tech so they are great if you’re a beginner or you won’t be playing a lot of highly competitive games. Mechanical guns have less parts and don’t require battery power so they tend to be sturdier.They can withstand woodsball where you might get them a little muddy or might be rougher on them.
This is also a good option if your budget is lower because their simplicity makes them cheaper.
One downside is they are not programmable so they are less versatile.
If you plan to play once or twice a month on a field course with some friends, get a mechanical gun.

, These guns are electric and can be programmed for fire-rate and for semi-automatic, burst, or automatic. If you will play competitive speedball, you can do it with a mechanical gun but you’ll be at a disadvantage. The electronic parts of these guns make them a little less durable.


These guns have come down in price a lot since they were introduced but will still typically cost more than a mechanical gun because of the added capability.
One of the key advantages of an electro-pneumatic gun is that you can fire much more rapidly and can program the gun to be automatic, meaning you can hold the trigger to fire multiple balls rather than one ball per trigger squeeze.

, There are lots of different ways you can customize some high-end guns, but others have littler versatility. If you think you may invest more money in your gun later on, you want to pick a gun that allows you to add scopes, adjust fire rate, or attach a new barrel.


Most paintball guns allow you to change barrels and hoppers at least, but higher tech ones will allow for greater customizations.
Balance is important here. You don’t want to buy a low-end gun that won’t let you make any changes, but you may not want an expensive, high-end gun that you’ll never actually add anything to.
It’s also good to choose guns that have mass-produced and interchangeable parts to ensure that you will be able to make repairs on the gun if you need to.

, The best gun is ultimately the one that feels most comfortable to you, not the gun with all the best specifications. See if the gun feels too heavy or too light, taking into account the added weight of the air tank, hopper, and any sights you might add.How the gun looks is somewhat important because you want to like the look, but how it feels in your hands is much more important.
If you are buying online, it is still good to shop around at stores that sell paintball guns so you are able to handle it. You can’t judge a gun fully just by seeing a picture on a screen.

, Squeeze the trigger to see how easy it moves. Switch the safety mechanism on and off. Try out the cocking mechanism. All of these should be easy to use so that you can do them quickly when you need to.


If the seller will let add and remove a barrel, hopper, and air tank, you can see how easy the parts are to adjust. Don’t buy a gun that doesn’t allow you to easily change part out.

, Once you have settled on the specific gun that you want, check with a few stores and online sellers to see if that particular gun is sold at different prices. A local shop might be able to lower the price or throw in extras.When comparing, double check that it’s the exact same model and whether or not the price includes any extras like hopper, strap, or tank.
If you decide on the model that you want, it’s worth looking into buying a used gun, which would save you money. You want to make sure the seller is reliable and that the gun definitely works.
Buying online might get you a lower original price, but make sure you know about any shipping costs as this might end up being more than you expect.

If your first shot misses and the person does not know where you are, wait for another shot.,
If your first shot misses and the person knows where you are follow with a volley of shots, and move away from your target if possible.

",How to Be a Paintball Sniper," Being a sniper is mostly for people who are scared of being in the action (or people who have the patience and skill to do it effectively in big games, in small games snipers are not effective). Most normal people are not snipers and they just play paintball normally. But if you want to become a real paintball sniper then you are at the right place. Actual snipers can take days to move in to their targets, and find the perfect position. In a 10 minute paintball game, this isn't going to be practical. Instead, consider simply playing as a marksman, and taking long distance shots, while being at the front line. However, in larger scenario games, playing as a sniper can be a vital role, and prove to be a very fun experience.;
,,,,,, When moving, keep your profile as low to as possible, by pulling your marker in towards you so that the barrel is pointing away from you, and the rest of the gun is tucked next to your stomach. Keep your head up to look for targets, and take your step at a slow cadence.

, The less movement and work you have to do, the better off you are. Places that intersect or parallel well traveled paths, open fields, and villages or bunkers is going to be the best chance you'll have at bringing in a target. Also remember that unlike a real rifle, your range is going to be limited to a very short distance, at maximum 60 yards (54.9 m). Also try find places that are up high. Having the high ground is always a good tactic.

, Human shapes naturally draw the eyes towards you. Choose areas where there is a lack of light coming in, such as bushes, ridges, or areas where there are lots of fallen leaves or trees. Choose your camouflage according to the area, and the season as well. Laying down will decrease your silhouette.

, Take your time to set yourself up and get comfy. In longer scenario paintball games, you could be waiting from an hour to a half an hour. Depending on the type of game, paintball sniping may not be practical due to time constraints.

, Look for markers from which to judge distance, and base your shots. Remember once again, that a paintball is not like a real bullet, and has a very short range. This range is also severely effected by the wind, and if you are using the Co2, how cold or warm the CO2 is. Once again, time constraints come in to play here. If you are in a short match, then this may not be practical.

, 25% works a general rule, because in short games (5-15 minutes) sniping is not going to be practical, so moving every couple of minutes would be normal anyway. In longer scenario games, if the enemy hasn't advanced to the position you are working at, chances are they won't advance through that position at all. Remember to move quietly!

, Do not fire unless you are in range or your target sees you and shoots first. Because if your paint balls do not make it to your target, that will give away your position and that person could get away or come after you.

, To do this, move your sight or scope over your target, and attempt to center the sights over the target's body, as this is the biggest mass and most easy to hit. If you think you have a good shot and a good line of sight, put your hand on the Marker's trigger/lever and squeeze it to fire off a paintball.

, To aim again, look to where your ball went. If it curved left or right, it is possible you had either a spike in wind speed or Co2 velocity. In this case, adjust for wind, and take another shot.

Move towards the closest bunker to the snake (the snake is a long bunker that stretches most of the field)or right off the break (the start) just run off at it.,
Run towards the snake when things calm down.

,
Make sure your back player is burning your lane to give you the opportunity to advance; if the back player on your mirror is also burning, you have a very slim chance of getting to the snake.,
Lean out and post on him (being in the shooting position and waiting for the opponent to come out) and get the elimination.,
Move down the snake and make sure that your whole body is concealed behind it.,
Start searching for any enemies when you cross into enemy territories.,

,, It is best to slide in on your knees since it allows you to get down low behind it and immediately start firing.

, then bump up all the way while making stops along the way. If you can eliminate the back players directly down the field your life will be so much easier. Look ahead before you start shooting people down on the other side of the field.<When you get in you'll want to be shooting your tape ( the boundaries) If someone else on the other team is in, know where they are. br>

, If there are other bunkers along the way, make sure you know the other side is clear before going around them.

, Usually when you are at the 50 you can shoot cross field to the 50 dorito and hit his back side.

, After making sure the area is safe, dash across assuming 2-3 people on the other team are left. You may have already 3 eliminations. the opposing snake player, 50 dorito, and the back player directly in front of you. Now assume that the snakes on your right side, so the people left are in the middle back or possibly the 30 dorito.That's perfect everyone is on the other side of the field so prepare for your Ollie Lang run. Run them down getting the final two eliminations.

Purchase a decent barrel - There are a variety of lengths and materials that can drastically increase your accuracy.,
Get a good paintball match to your barrel - All paintballs say they are .68 caliber, but all brands still aren't all exactly the same size.,
Learn the importance of consistency - If your marker doesn't shoot an equal amount of air or CO2 each time, a good barrel hardly helps, you will not be able to shoot accurately.,
Reduce friction within the marker -Tippmanns are one of the most popular markers for woodsball and many people ""snipe"" with them, but from the factory Tippmanns have paint residue in the receiver where the bolts move that causes friction.,
Understand the value of a sight versus a scope.,
Getting a remote kit, which is a line that allows you to put your Co2 Tank or Air Tank on your back, will allow you to significantly lighten your marker.,
Understand that camouflage is very important Since the ideal range for a regular player is about like 50–60 feet (15.2–18.3 m),a sniper can be anywhere from 100 feet (30.5 m) to about 200 if you elevate your shot, and if you do it at a 40 degree arch, you'll get about 300 feet (91.4 m), but no guarantees.125 feet (0.0 m) is where you are sure to hit them with one shot,so you need to be able to conceal yourself, and that means your marker and you needs to be camouflaged.,
Be sure to have a stock for stability.,
Almost every paintball marker has a very similar effective range (even 200ft isn't that far, and you probably won't hit them from that range unless you practice with long-balling, where you elevate your paintball gun.),
You can also lower your a5's trigger pull by getting a mechanical pencil spring and swapping it with part #2 in the manual.,
Have fun tinkering with the marker.,
A bipod also helps if you like to crawl around on the field, or are set up in a bunker, or whatever you manage to find.

",How to Build the Ultimate Tippmann Sniper Paintball Gun," The two things that most influence your accuracy are the paintball and barrel combination. A Flatline Barrel System by Tippmann is proven to increase range. If you don't get a flatline, a barrel 14–16 inches (35.6–40.6 cm), possibly a J and J ceramic, a Smart Parts barrel, or an Apex barrel attachment which can effectively increase the range of your marker by 100 feet (30.5 m). Do not get anything long just to maintain the same fps. Barrel kits are often the most versatile and accurate barrels available as you can match the size of your barrel to the size of the paintballs you are shooting. Make sure your barrel has the right threading. Note that the A5 takes different threading than the 98 custom.;
, If the paintballs you are shooting do not match your barrel, they will either not shoot straight or they will burst in the barrel. You can tell if the paintball matches the barrel by removing your barrel and dropping a paintball in it. If it just rolls out, the paintball is too small; if it gets stuck when you blow into the barrel, it is too big. It needs not to fall out but go through easily whenever you blow into the barrel. The best way to get a good bore to paintball match is to get a barrel kit that includes different barrel pieces to match variously size paintballs. When it comes to buying paintballs, you usually get what you pay for. The cheaper the paint, the more dimples and inconsistencies they tend to have. This, of course, hurts your accuracy. Paintballs range in price from $25-$75 for 2000 balls. More expensive paintballs will typically be the best, but not always.

, Consistency is improved by the use of a regulator. Regulators are either high or low pressure. If you get one make sure that the pressure rating of the regulator is compatible with the pressure needed to operate the marker. With most woodsball marker, this will be high pressure. Regulators do what the name says; they regulate the gas to keep the gas getting to the valve at a constant pressure, so each shot should expel exactly the same amount of gas. In combination with a good bore to paint size match, regulators can make your marker shoot paint much more accurately.

, If you polish the contact points between the front bolt, rear bolt, and the receivers, you can drastically decrease friction within the marker, making the Tippmann shoot much more consistently. And consistency is just as important as accuracy.

, A sight is a good idea to get consistently more accurate shots, NOT A SCOPE. Scopes are considered largely impractical in paintball because paintballs don't fly straight, it takes time to focus somebody into a scope, and scopes won't help you by getting a magnified picture of somebody, as you can't hit them anyway. At their maximum range, paintballs go some 200 feet (61.0 m), and the aim range is more like 75–100 feet (22.9–30.5 m). A sight could be a red dot sight or simple iron sights. and if your sniping, you'll likely be aiming your gun up in the air higher than your target, since the paintballs will drop off after a certain distance.

, This allows you to crawl more quickly and bring your marker to bear faster, as well as making it easier to get through the woods.

, Get a ghillie suit if you can afford one, if not use local vegetation, or branches, bushes and twigs, and fasten them onto you. the more natural you look, the better.

, It may, or may not, improve your performance as a sniper it will make your marker more stable though, especially while standing up, and will help you when adjust your marker for a long shot .

, a paintball sniper must get close to be assured a one shot kill, and this means that you are well within the enemies range. You must be well concealed, and you must be able to hit what you shoot at. Your marker should reflect that.

, If the spring is two short it may cause the marker to fire randomly. Get a few springs to see which one works best, but note that this can be illegal in some fields, and you may end up shooting more balls than you need. stick to what you have, but if you don't like the pull, then go ahead and swap out the springs, and save the springs too.

, A5's can be easily transformed into a variety of markers, such as M4's, AK47's and MP5's, but its mostly cosmetic, and won't help your actual game, except for maybe lighter load and steadier shot.

Make sure you know the weight of your equipment.,
To learn the basics you will need to learn ""marker"" positioning.,
Even expensive paintball guns can have bad firing rates (you can fix that).,
Running and shooting: not much to say here; it's mandatory in paintball.,
Master the art of bunkering.,
Learn how to snap shoot (this is where you are in a gun fight and you pop out of a bunker just enough to get some shots off and go back in).,
Be prepared to reload in a gunfight.,
In speedball, most parks will make you put your barrel or gun on the dead box (the place you go behind or in when you're hit), then they will say 3,2,1 real fast or normal take off to your position front, middle or back.,
Learn your positions.,
Walk the field and have a game plan with your teammates.,
In woodsball, sometimes called rec ball, strategy and communication are key.",How to Become a Good Paintballer," Your equipment should not be too bulky or heavy, as this will put you at a great disadvantage on the field.;
, First put on your mask (to make it more realistic). You can use a laser pointer taped to the barrel of the marker to represent were you would hit if you fired a paintball. Now, with the pointer on and the mask on, put it into firing position. Learn that position. If you can, (put the marker barrel-down) and try to estimate were the shot would hit before you even bring up your marker. Quickly bring up your marker into firing position. Practice this for a while, and then without the laser pointer.but do not let the opponent see the light or else the opponent can trace it back it you and tag you if too many opponents notice you before you realize it and then have another target.

, Take your middle and index finger and place them in the air as if they were a pair of scissors. Position your thumb straight and pinkie and ring finger like you're holding a gun. Take your middle and index fingers and place them on the trigger. Start pulling the trigger slowly back and forth, then get faster and faster. This is called ""walking the trigger"". You will have to put more pressure on those fingers in a real marker trigger. Try this out with different guns, and find the one that you can fire with the fastest. There are market triggers available for almost all guns. (This will only work for markers with a ""double trigger."" That is, a trigger that has room for two fingers.) This technique is also called ""spray and pray"" since you are not usually concerned with accuracy; only with getting a lot of paint into the air quickly.

, With the laser pointer, put the gun into firing position. Then aim the laser pointer at a wall inside your house. Try to keep the laser on the wall steady as you go from walk, jog, to running. You will feel comfortable after a while.

, When you're in a three-on-three man match, get into a bunker! When you find your man, start firing. After you do get your man, make sure he is the only threat shooting at you. Keep him in or let him run out of paint then run towards him, fire off a couple rounds and make sure you hit him. You can try to bunker him when he is least suspecting it or have your teammates pin him down, then bunker him.

, Watch your position. One way to perfect your sharpshooting is to practice in front of a mirror. Get behind an object in front of the mirror and practice making accurate shots by popping out of the object, or as called, bunker.

, Make sure you have paintball pods in your harness. Relay information to your teammate (yell ""reloading, cover me!""); ""Cover me"" is the key phrase and not too loud because then if you yell through the sky it will echo and then it could bring opponents when you're reloading, making you vulnerable. Now open your hopper. Keep a finger on the trigger, take a pod out then pop the top of the pod, and pour in the paint into the gun. Throw your pod on the ground (don't worry, you will get them back), close the hopper and start firing. You may not want to yell ""reloading"" because the other team will hear as well, and try to bunker you. Practice reloading and you won't have to ask your team to cover you.

, Start firing now.

, There are 3 main positions in speedball: front, middle, and back.


The Front man is the one who relays information about what is going on to the middle and looks for windows or openings to bunker or take out a player.
The middle player relays the info from the front to the back. they shoot a lot of paint, so they should have a good hopper and be great snap shooters.
Back men shoot a lot of paint to try to get men out and help out with the openings for the front man.

, Making game plans by yourself can lead to confusion of your team. Your plan may not be fool proof because it wasn't viewed with multiple people. Making a game plan with the teammates can lead to better results.

, Have a strategy and communicate with your teammates. Two of anything beats a single ace."

Stretch.,
Do some cardio.,
Make sure to exercise your core, arms, and legs.,
Erg.,
For in the boat, Make a practice schedule for yourself and make sure to vary your workouts between sprint and distance pieces.,
Diet.,
Visualize.",How to Train for Rowing," Remember to stretch before partaking in any form of exercise or strenuous activity. This will greatly reduce the likelihood of injuring yourself.;
, Some great cardiovascular workouts include running and biking. Begin by taking a test run to see how far you can go before you have to stop. Then push yourself slightly farther the next day.

, This includes lifting weights, doing crunches, and running or biking. Again, build on what you accomplished the day before, that way you will begin to see results quickly.

, The erg will give you a great total body workout and will prepare you for using each group of muscles during the appropriate parts of the stroke. Use an erg regularly in order to maintain muscular and cardiovascular strength in the areas of the body used most commonly when rowing.

, Practice all parts of the stroke and try to perfect your technique. Nothing simulates racing better than actually doing drills on the water.

, A proper diet is key to improving your skill in the sport of rowing. Make sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid refined carbs. Do not indulge on sweets too often as these are full of empty calories that are not useful in building muscle and improving stamina. Make sure to hydrate frequently as well since your body is now expending water more rapidly as you train.

, One of the most important forms of mental preparation for rowers is visualization. Sit in a quiet space with legs crossed in ""criss-cross-applesauce"" formation, back straight, head up, and arms relaxed. For eight minutes, run through the race in your head. Imagine every detail that you would see, hear, or feel throughout the race and allow yourself to become immersed in a deeper state of mind.

Avoid moisturizer.,
Wash your hands after rowing or using a rowing machine.,
Cut off flaps of skin.,
Use antibiotic ointment.,
Use athletic tape.,
Don't pick at them.,
Always hold the oar properly.",How to Take Care of Your Hands As a Rower," While moisturizer will do a fantastic job of getting rid of your calluses and softening your hands (after all, that's what it's meant to do), that's exactly what you don't want. When your calluses disappear, all that happens is you need to get them back the next time you grab an oar. Calluses are protective. Let them stay.


Moisturizing soaps are usually best avoided, too.;
, All that backsplash-canal-water hitting your hands doesn't just make the oar slippery, it has all sorts of bacteria in it. And who knows if the handle of the rowing machine was wiped down after the last person used it?


You can also wipe down the rowing machine before you use it to help prevent against bacteria getting in open blisters and rubbed off skin.

, If there is a flap of skin on your hand that won't stay flat to your hand, or has an open side wide enough to let sand underneath, cut it off. A small makeup scissors, nail clipper, or safety scissors will do the trick. If you leave it, bits of dirt and grit will end up underneath it.


You may need to put on a small adhesive bandage for a short amount of time while the skin is still raw, but only do this while rowing as needed. When not rowing, allow the raw skin to dry so that soon it will begin to heal up and not hurt. The side of your thumb where you feather is especially susceptible to these types of wounds.

, Anywhere you have a lack of skin on your hands you should apply antibiotic ointment twice a day.

, While some people swear by athletic tape, others don't like to use it, and others find it more trouble than it's worth. Whatever you feel, band-aids will need to be covered with it. They won't stay on while you're rowing without it. Putting some pre-wrap on before you put the tape on can make it more bearable to wear, and you won't get leftover stickiness on your hands once you remove the athletic tape.

, If you remove your calluses with your fingernails, you'll just have to build them back later. As much as you may feel tempted, avoid it. If skin is protected, don't open it up!!

, While it may be tempting to adjust your grip (by doing something like moving your thumbs to the top of the handle, instead of the bottom where they belong) to avoid putting pressure on certain areas, you'll likely even end up with more painful spots. At the very least you'll have more bad habits and less efficient practice time. Focus on improving your rowing, and let the calluses improve themselves!


If you aren't sure how you should be doing this, ask your coach.

Get in the proper starting position.,
Drive back with your legs and hips.,
Pull back with your arms.,
Go back to the starting position.,
Exhale during the drive and inhale during the recovery.",How to Row Faster1," The starting position is also known as the catch. In this position, your arms should be straight out in front of you and your shoulders should be level. Lean your upper body forward but keep a straight back. Bend your knees and keep your shins as vertical as possible., Push off with your legs and use them to propel yourself backward. Once your legs are extended, bump your hips up. Pulling with your arms in the beginning of the drive will make your rowing less efficient and you'll get tired faster., Bend your arms and pull your hands back to your chest while leaning back so that you can get the most power out of your drive. This is called the finish position.Your hands should come to the bottom of your chest at the end of each drive.

, After the finish, you enter the recovery stage. Don't rush your recovery by aggressively pushing forward. Instead, concentrate on developing a healthy pace rather than expending unneeded energy. Calm your muscles and allow your body to return to the starting position.It's called the recovery stage because you should be exhaling and resting your muscles for a short period.
The idea behind getting faster is setting a good pace, not frantically trying to pull back as fast as you can during every stroke.

, Make sure to inhale during this time and exhale as you pull backward. Taking short breaths will cause you to become tired faster, and will reduce the speed of your stroke over time. Regulate your breathing by inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling out of your mouth."
"
Practice.,
Do three short pulls to get your machine started.,
Adjust the drag setting on your machine.,
Watch your performance monitor.",How to Row Faster2," To increase your rowing times, you'll want your motion to be as smooth as possible. Don't jerk your legs back during the drive or throw your weight into your upper body. Try to transition to each stage of the stroke as smoothly as possible., Instead of doing one deep pull to get the wheel started on a rowing machine, you can do three smaller pulls in succession. Grab onto the handles and pull back slightly as if you're doing a partial pull. Then, do another pull that's about half a repetition before doing one full pull. This will get your wheel started and so that you can find your pace faster., The drag setting will increase or decrease the resistance on the machine. If you're having issues because the resistance is too high, you can reduce this setting to make it easier to row. Adjust the drag factor by going into the machine's settings and lowering it.Play around with the settings until you find a drag factor that you feel comfortable with.

, Depending on what kind of rowing machine you're on, there will be different numbers on a display that tells you important details about your workout. Typically this information will include calories, pace, and stroke rate.Keep an eye on the stroke rate so that you know what kind of tempo you're keeping and how fast you're going."
"
Use your legs, not arms.,
Drill the things you aren't good at.,
Videotape yourself.",How to Row Faster3," Drive the seat back by pushing off with your legs, not pulling with your arms. Keep your elbows straight as you drive back with your legs. You should only pull at the very end of each drive.If you feel yourself coming off the rowing seat, it means that you're pushing up, not back.

, Practice will improve your technique and thus your overall speed. If you notice that you're having a hard time with a particular portion of the stroke, you'll want to concentrate on that stage more. Practice doing the part of the stroke you're struggling with, like the catch or the recovery, without doing the full stroke to perfect your technique., Watching a video of your technique will clue you into the areas that need improvement. Have a friend or teammate videotape your stroke and review the video so that you know what you should concentrate on improving."
"
Workout your lower abdominal muscles.,
Do front squats.,
Practice doing deadlifts.,
Use the pulldown machine.",How to Row Faster4," Your lower abdominals are a critical part of being able to row faster and longer. Use workouts like yoga and pilates as well as traditional core exercises like pushups, crunches, and leg lifts to work out your lower abdominal muscles., Stand with your feet shoulder width and hold the bar on your chest so that it runs under your chin. Front squats will develop your core strength, upper back, and quadriceps, which are all muscles that are heavily used while rowing.Keep your elbows high to maintain good posture.
The bottom portion of the front squat resembles the position you're in during the catch.

, Deadlifts are great because they mimic the action that you do during the drive. Your knees are bent and must drive up. You finish the lift with your shoulders and back, which are the same muscles you utilize when you row., The pulldown machine will work out your shoulders, back, and arms. This is a great exercise to help build power and explosiveness in the final stages of your drive. Grab onto the pulldown grips and pull them down in front of to your chest and down to your waist."

Final preparations.,
Race hard.",How to Prepare for a Regatta (Rowing)," Carbo-loading the night before will never hurt - have a pasta party with your team the day before a race. Make sure you wake up early enough to have a full breakfast before the race and drink lots of water up until about 45 minutes before your start, when you should start tapering off. Don't worry about how much food you consume on race day until about an hour and a half before your start - just eat however much you want and use the bathroom whenever necessary. Stay away from anything sugary. Taper off your food consumption around an hour and a half before your start. A protein or granola bar or two is fine after that. If you are having problems with digestion, try to eat foods with a lot of fiber like prunes, cranberries, and some cereals (like Grape Nuts).;
, Before your first race ensure you apply yourself with liberal amounts of baby oil to reduce friction during the race, top up in between races to keep a plentiful amount of oil on your skin.

, ALWAYS get a full night of sleep before a race day, but make sure you wake up in enough time to eat and digest breakfast before the race. This means you may have to go to bed early in order to wake up early. If your category is not a straight final, or if you are racing in multiple categories, you may want to take a nap in between races. Naps can be great for you. However, you will want to make sure you do not nap in a location or in a position that will make you sore or stiff when you wake up. Stretch before you nap. If you want to eat before your next race, get most of your eating done before your nap. Set a timer for an hour and a half before your start. This will give you time for your body to wake up, time to use the facilities (such as they are), and time to rehydrate. Do not sleep through your race.

, Different psychological race prep methods work for different people. You might want to listen to music to pump or or to calm down, or you might want to talk with your crew to do the same. You may want to be alone or you may want to be with other people. It's probably best not to be too pumped up (don't burn out) or too calm (it is a race, after all). You may want to put together a pre-race playlist a few days before if you like to listen to music. If you prefer a longer warm-up than your team, hit the erg or take a short jog, but DO NOT tire yourself out. Nothing more than 25% effort.

, If your boat has a race plan, know it. Talk with your coxswain about the race if you need to. You may also want to consider making a personal race plan to keep your mind on something during the race. On the other hand, ""get in front; stay in front"" is still a legitimate plan. Figure out what works for you.

, Check your seat on the boat. Make sure your stretchers are tied and your slide is rolling smoothly. If you've rigged the boat that day, check to make sure the riggers are on the right seats - this makes a big difference in the set of the boat! Be sure you have all the clothes you need and a little water. Warm up with your team.

, Give it all you've got.

Stop your boat by digging your blade in the water.",How to Row," The best way to prepare you to row on a boat in the water is by building your body strength on a water rower machine. This machine will target all the areas on your body that you will be using when in an actual boat: your legs, core, and upper body. You can purchase one of these machines for home use, or you can find them in many gyms or work out facilities.;
, There are many exercises you can do to strengthen your core and abs. These exercises will help target not just your core, but your upper body as well:Plank: Lie face down on the ground. Place your elbows on the ground underneath your shoulders with your forearms extended straight in front of you. Then, left yourself up on your toes and your forearms, keeping your body straight. Hold this position for 30 seconds to two minutes, increasing the amount of time you hold as you get stronger.
Side plank: Begin in the same position as the plank and lift yourself up onto your arms and toes. Then, slowly turn your body to the side, so that your weight is resting on one foot and one arm (either your left foot and arm or your right). Make sure your body is in a straight line and you aren't leaning over. Hold this position for 30 seconds to two minutes and then switch to the other side.
V-sit hold: Sit on the ground with your legs straight in front of you and your upper body straight. Then, extend your arms out in front of you and slowly lift your legs off the ground. As you lift your legs off the ground, keep them straight, and slowly lean your upper body back, making sure to keep your back straight as you do so. Hold this position for 30 to 90 seconds.

, Your lower body is important when it comes to rowing because 60 percent of the strength you use to row should come from your legs. There are many exercises you can do to improve lower body strength, but a few to start with are:


Bridge: Lie on your back with you knees bent and feet flat against the floor, hip width apart. Then, slowly lift up your butt, using your glutes, until you have a straight line going from your shoulders to your knees. Hold the position for one to two minutes, or lower your butt and raise it again at a quick pace without letting your butt touch the ground. To make this position even harder, you can extend one leg straight out, keeping it in the air as you raise your butt.
Barbell squat: Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and place a barbell behind your head across your shoulders and grip it with your hands. Squat like you are about to sit down, keeping your upper body straight and your chest out. Go as low as you can and then, stand back up and repeat. Do three sets of 12 reps.Barbell/dumbbell lunges: Start by standing up with your feet together. Position the barbell as you did before, or hold a dumbbell in each hand. Then, take a step forward, bending your front knee so it creates a right angle, and lowering your back knee so that it almost touches the ground. Then, bring your back foot next to your front foot and repeat on the other side. You can do these in place, or you can do them walking. Try to do 50 yards of walking lunges.

, Most rowers actually focus more on their core and legs because that is where most of their strength will come from, but it can be beneficial to improve your upper body strength as well. Along with doing planks, you can do a few of these exercises to improve your arm muscles:Plank push ups: Start in the plank position, but instead of putting your elbows on the ground, you will put your hands underneath your shoulders. Push up to a plank position, with your weight on your hands and toes. Then, lower your body, keeping your elbows close to your body (you don't want them to push outwards away from the body). Don't allow your body to touch the floor, and then push yourself up again into that plank position.
Reverse grip pulldowns: This exercise requires a pulldown machine. Sit at the machine and reach above you with an underhand grip to reach the pulldown bar. Then, slowly pull it down, using your upper body strength rather than momentum, until the bar is in line with your chest. Then, slowly allow the bar to go back to its starting position and repeat.
Barbell rows: This is a great exercise to target the muscles you'll need for rowing. Position your hands shoulder width apart on a barbell on the ground with an overhand grip. Bend your body over so that your back is flat, in a table top position and your knees are straight or slightly bent, depending on your flexibility. Then, lift the barbell up to your chest, keeping your back flat, and lower back down (try not to let it touch the ground). Do five sets of five reps and try to place as much weight on the barbell as possible.

, To begin rowing, you'll need to sit at the machine with your feet in front of you on the machine and your knees bent. Your arms will then be straight, extended in front of you, with your knees inside the arms. You will grab hold of the handle with both hands, and your stomach and chest should be resting against the tops of your thighs. This is called the ""catch"" position., Rowing on a machine consists of several different positions and phases. It's important to know these positions so that you can achieve the right movement on your machine. These movements can then be applied to competitive rowing in the water.You start at the catch position, and then you move to the release position through the drive phase. The drive phase is when you are pulling the handle towards your body and extending your legs. The release position is the position at the end of the drive phase -- your legs are straight in front of you, your body is sitting upright, and your arms are pulled in towards you.
Then, you will move on to the rock over phase, to the recovery phase, and finally back to your catch position. The rock over phase is when you begin to release your arms from the release position, allowing them to go straight, but keeping your legs straight. Then, in the recovery phase, as your upper body bends forward and your arms are fully straightened, you will begin to bend your knees until you've reached the catch position.

, When you row, you aren't engaging your entire body at once -- there is a sequence involved. Rowing involves using your legs first (by first straightening them), then your core (by pulling your upper body back), then your arms (by pulling the handle to your chest). When you allow the handle to move back to its starting position you will do the reverse, first engaging your arms (by straightening them), then your core (by allowing it to be pulled forward), then your legs (by bending them).If you engage your muscles out of order or all at once, it can be difficult to get your timing and rhythm right, and it can also decrease the amount of power you are able to use.
Make sure when you pull the handle back, that you allow your legs to fully straighten before you initiate the power with your core. Then, when moving to your starting position, make sure your arms are fully straightened before you bend your knees.

, You are not engaging all parts of your body equally. When rowing, 60 percent of the power will come from your legs, 20 percent in your core, and then 20 percent in your arms.If you use more arm strength than leg strength, you will be able to pull, but you won't be able to do so for long. Your upper body will get tired quickly and you'll begin relying on your momentum to pull rather than your strength.

, Rowing also depends greatly on your timing. Instead of doing one count out and one count in, you will take one count out and two counts in. This means that as you pull the handle towards you and extend your legs in front of you, you will use one count. Then, as you allow the handle to move back to its starting position, allowing your arms to straighten and then your knees to bend, you will use two counts.To get the right timing, you can practice saying ""one"" on the drive, and then ""two, three"" on the release and recovery phase. Or, you can say ""power"" on the drive and then ""patience, patience"" on the release and recovery phase.
Timing your strokes is important because you want to make sure you have enough recovery. Because pulling takes more power, you'll need double the amount of time to release so that you can recover and prepare for your next pull.

, If you aren't sure where to sit, look for where the oarlocks are located. These are the small rings through which the oars are placed. Because the action of rowing is backwards, that is, the force of rowing propels you backwards, you should sit with your back to the bow (the front of the boat) and face the stern (the rear of the boat).


If they aren't in place already, run the oars through the oar hooks so that the blade is in the water and the handle is in the boat. Make sure the oarlock points towards the back of the boat. If your oarlock faces the bow of the boat, it will be more difficult to row because the pitch of your blade will be off.
Make sure the boat you are using to row in is an actual rowboat. If you row in a boat not designed for rowing, the task of rowing is going to be much more difficult. An ideal rowboat is 12 to 17 feet in length.

, Some rowboats will come with foot stretchers that will need to be adjusted to the length of your legs. If you have longer legs, the foot stretcher may need to be adjusted so that it is farther away from you. To figure out where you foot stretchers need to be, push back in your seat until your legs are straight, and make sure the handles of the oars almost touch your body (but not quite).If you have lots of room between your handles and your chest when your legs are extended, you may need to move the foot stretchers away from you towards the stern. If you don't have much room between your handles and your chest, you may need to move your foot stretchers towards you, towards the bow.
If you have more of a classic rowboat, or one that isn't designed for sports, you may not have foot stretchers or a seat that pushes backwards. In that case, you will still be doing similar arm movements as that of a rowing machine, but you won't be extending your legs.

, Your hand should be at the end of the oar, with your thumb on the tip of the oar. A typical rowboat has two oars, and the oars should be about twice the length of the beam of the boat, which is the width of the boat. For a beginner, it's best to use oars that don't overlap when you are in the catch phase.

, If you have a rowboat that allows you to straighten your legs and push back as you row, you will use the exact same motions as a rowing machine. If your rowboat doesn't allow you to straighten your legs, then use the same arm movements, and lean back as you enter the drive phase, so that you are still relying on some of your leg strength.


Make sure if you don't have the ability to extend your legs that you are using your shoulder and core strength and not your back to pull the oars towards you. However, your upper body should still only be some of the strength you are using. You want to use as much leg strength and lower body strength as possible. This may involve you using your glutes and hips for power.

, In this position you will begin to put your blade into the water. You will sit as you would at a rowing machine, with your knees bent and your arms straight in front of you. The blades will rest above the water, perpendicular to the surface of the water. You will then prepare to move onto the drive.

, In this phase, you will be moving the blade through the water, with the blade going towards the stern of the boat. As you move from the catch position to the drive position, your blade should enter the water, and you will pull the handles of the oar towards you while also allowing your upper body to fall back and your legs to straighten. If you are in a boat that allows you to mimic the drive position of a rowing machine, then do so.Make sure blades are just underneath the surface of the water, and not buried deep into the water, as it will be more difficult to row the deeper the oar is.

, This position is right before you take the blade out of the water, when your arms are bent, your back is straight and upright, and your legs are straight out in front of you. As you finished the drive phase, you should have pulled the handles of the oars towards your chest, and the blades should be in front of you, towards the stern of the boat.Once again, if you can copy the position of the release on the rowing machine, then do so. If not, keep your legs in whatever position you had them in, but make sure your upper body and your arms are positioned as they would be on a rowing machine.

, This phase is when you lift the blades out of the water, feather them, and then bring yourself to the catch position. As you take the blade out of the water, bring your upper body forward and begin to straighten your arms out in front of you. This will cause the handles of the oars to separate, and the blades will be pointed towards the bow of the boat.


Feathering your oars essentially means that once you lift them out of the water, you will turn them so that they are parallel with the surface of the water, and hold them an inch or two above the water. This positioning of the blade will give you less wind resistance.

, Now that you've made one row, you will return to your beginning position and row again. In the catch position, you will turn the blades from their feathered position so they are perpendicular to the surface of the water, and then prepare to take another row.

, If you are looking to turn your boat in a different direction, simply use one oar instead of two oars. If you want to turn your boat to the left, for example, you would use the left oar, and use your strength to pull just that oar. This will cause your boat to turn to the left.If you want to turn on a smaller radius, hold water with one oar and row with the opposite oar. For example, if you are turning your boat to the right, place your left oar in the water and hold water, and row with your right oar.
For an even smaller radius, take a normal stroke with one oar and a back stroke with the other oar. To turn left, do a normal row with your left oar, but then do a backwards row with your right oar. Essentially in a backwards row, you will be bringing one oar through the water and towards the bow of the boat versus a normal row where you move the oars through the water towards the stern of the boat.

, With your blade slightly feathered, meaning it's not totally parallel to surface of the water, but it's not completely perpendicular, dig your blade into the water. As you stick your blade in the water, straighten your arms and your boat should stop in a short time."
"
Get in the boat.,
Push your hands forward.,
Feather the oars.,
Pull the oars back.,
Feather the oars flat, then repeat from step two.,
Practice.",How to Row (Crew)," Have the boat parallel to the dock, unattached. Make sure the oars are in and are pushed as far as they can go until the catch, and that the 'oar lock' on the rigger is closed, to stop the oar from popping out. Move the oars forward and hold them with one hand. Slide the seat back, and put one foot in. Make sure to stand only on the parts of the boat that are marked with tape and do not step in the bottom, or rounded, part of the boat. Then squat down and sit down on the sliding chair. You should then be able to put the foot in the shoe, and then move the other foot in. Hold the oars in one hand and push off of the dock. Always keep one hand on the dock until you push off the dock.;
, The oars will move back. Make sure they're flat on the water when you do this. Keep moving your hands forward until you can't reach anymore. Then bend your body over until it is fully extended. Then you should bend your knees so the seat moves up until your shins are perpendicular to the water. Remember not to lunge (called 'rushing the slide') when you get to the front or reach for too much length.








, This means to roll your wrists so the oars shift so that they are parallel to, yet above, the water. In sweep rowing (one oar), it is important to only roll the wrist closest to the oar blade (a.k.a. the inside hand). This requires very little effort and the oars are built to stay in the flat or squared position, so don't fight it! If you're just starting out, you can row ""on the square."" Though this may unset the boat for new rowers, it is a useful technique in larger boats, especially when rowing half-crew.








, When sitting forward the first motion is to push your legs back in a dynamic motion, and the seat slide back. Do not jerk but apply some force. As you continue to improve, you can start to add more force, but it's helpful to get the technique down properly before you try to go quickly. Then lean back when you are close to the end of the stroke. The final motion should be the arms. The boat will probably spring backwards. Don't be worried, shells only go backwards.








, Be sure to roll up the oar(s) once the handle passes the knees. Continue doing this until you feel you've traveled an appropriate amount, and then row back to where you got on.








, It takes a long time to perfect your proper rowing technique. But do not be discouraged, the sport is great fun and a great workout. The first few times out will be difficult, but the more you get to know the boat you are rowing the easier it will get.

Build your physical fitness with regular exercise, which can consist of rowing, running, cycling and/or weightlifting.",How to Prevent Knee Injuries in Rowing,"


Many cities and towns with a marina, lake, or river have a rowing club where you can take classes or private lessons.
If you don't live by the water or don't feel comfortable on the water, you can use a rowing machine at your local gym or buy one for use at home. Make sure to take some lessons from a personal trainer so you understand the basics of the exercise.;
, A good warm up consists of approximately 10 minutes of aerobic exercise such as light rowing or running.

, Long, sustained stretches of all the major muscle groups such as legs, arms, back, chest and abs are recommended. A healthy stretch is smooth, without bouncing, and lasts between 20 and 30 seconds.

, Listen to your coach's instructions and those of other experienced rowers.


Coming up too fast on the recovery of a stroke can result in too much force on the knee joint. Pay attention to a smooth yet strong transition from the recovery to the next stroke.
Plant your feet correctly. Don't just use the ball of the foot or your heel; instead, push off using the entire foot. It may take some time before your calves are stretched enough but with time and practice you'll most likely be able master it.
Try to perfect your technique. By rowing with better technique, you'll need fewer strokes and have less chance of injuries.

, Straining your muscles, tendons and joints is likely to lead to injuries. Bring your intensity down a notch if you feel discomfort. If you feel any pain, stop immediately to prevent knee injuries.

, Muscles that are properly hydrated function better and are less likely to cramp up and create friction in the joints or tendons.

, After the main part of your training, spend between 5 and 10 minutes rowing at a decreased intensity to bring your heart rate down to normal.

, Spend about 5 minutes stretching your major muscle groups and pay attention to any muscles that feel especially tight.

, Strength and endurance combat fatigue, while fatigue facilitates mistakes.

With the other members of your boat, and probably a few others besides, pick up your boat, gently swing it over your head, and balance it there on extended arms as you walk towards the water.
Place your toes as close as possible to the water and swing the boat down.

,,


Retrieve blades and place them next to the boat.
Undo the oarlocks in order to place the blades in their positions.
Place the blades in their positions, making sure to put the correct blade on the correct side of the boat. Port blades typically have a red band/piece of tape, while starboard ones typically have blue or green.
Lock the gauges again, making sure that they are secure, but not so secure that you won't be able to undo them at the end of the day.

, You will notice that there is a hollow where your feet are strapped in. This is a convenient place to put a water bottle. You will need one.

,


Remove your shoes.
Hold all of your oars with one hand (two or one.) You should move your seat back, and step in the front of its track (not on the track, just where the seat would be if it was all the way forwards. Do not step in the hollow. Your foot may go through the boat, and that would be a bad end to both your day, and your expensive boat.
Sit down on the seat.
Strap your feet into the shoes in the boat. Ideally, you want the shoes secure but loose enough so that you can slide out of them if need be, but you may find (especially if you are rowing with your school) that the shoes are made for giants, and there is no way they are going to be secure. Don't worry about it. Do the best you can.

,


If someone (such as a coach) is on the dock, they may help you push away by picking up your oar and pushing it. If this happens, lean the oar they are pushing.

, They may say something like ""hard on port"" or ""port hard."" (or with starboard.) This just means that port oars should row harder than starboard oars (or vice versa.)

,, This is to ensure that a person rowing does not hit your blades, when you are not rowing. These, therefore, are guidelines, but by using common sense you will get better results.


For sculling: You should sit all the way forward on your slide, with your knees bent.
For sweeping: Flip your outside hand over so it is underneath the handle. Use your other hand to grab the side of the boat.

, This is done whenever you are not rowing to keep the boat level. If the boat is stopped, or other people are rowing, you set the boat. (If you are sculling, do both at the same time.)


If the boat is tipping towards your oar, lift the handle of your oar up. This pushes the flat of the blade on the water, leveling the boat.
If the boat is tipping away from your oar, push the handle of your oar down.

,


Push your hands down, allowing the blades to come off the water slightly.
Extend your arms.
Lean forward from your hips.
Glide forward on the runners by bending your knees. Go almost all the way forward, but not quite all the way.
Square your blades. This means rotate them 90 degrees to get them perpendicular to the water. If you are sweeping, this should be done only with the hand closest to the blade, the inside hand. This should not be done after sliding all the way forward, but should instead be done smoothly while you are sliding forward.
Allow your hands to come up, and let your blades go into the water.
As soon as the blades are in the water, push against the footplate with the balls of your feet to extend your legs, then lean back, and finally, last, bend your arms.
Push your hands down and feather your blades once they are out of the water.
Repeat the whole stroke again…and again…and again…and get into a rhythm.

Consider joining a gym.",How to Do a Total Body Rowing Workout," Some more advanced rowing machines may have a damper lever – look next to the flywheel. If the setting is too high, your muscles will exhaust too quickly and you won't get in an efficient workout.At the same time, you don't want the setting to be too low or you won't have a good workout. Aim for a middle-of-the-road setting where you can feel some resistance as you row, but aren't struggling with each stroke.
If you're new to indoor rowing, this may take a little trial and error before you find the best setting for you.
Keep in mind that as you get more practice rowing, you may want to set the damper to a higher level to increase the resistance.;
, The foot straps on a rowing machine should be secure across the ball of your foot. If your feet aren't in the straps properly, this will mean your legs aren't in the right position. If your legs are in the wrong position, you could end up with an awkward and inefficient stroke.If the strap isn't in the correct place, you may need to adjust the foot rests up or down a few pegs so the strap goes across the balls of your feet.
It may take some trial and error to get the foot rests and foot straps right, especially if you don't have much experience on a rowing machine. Complete a few slow strokes to make sure it feels okay and you're able to take a full stroke.

, Squeezing the handles tightly can cause you to crunch your wrists. Use an overhand grip, and wrap your fingers lightly around the handles while keeping your wrists straight and flat.Throughout your stroke, your wrists should be straight and flat, not curled. Extend your arms in front of you to start each stroke, then pull back from your elbows and upper arms.

, Maintaining good posture on the rowing machine is essential for engaging all muscle groups and avoiding injury. Keep your back straight even as you pull forward into your stroke.Engage your core to help improve your posture, especially if you're accustomed to hunching over a computer all day at work.
You'll also want to avoid the impulse to hunch your shoulders or slouch over your legs when you're pulled forward.
Make sure your back is aligned and your shoulders are flat and relaxed, not pulling up or forward. Push forward through your feet, extending your legs and keeping your shoulders relaxed. When you start the next stroke, pull your arms forward in front of you, keeping your shoulders in the same place.

, While you may be tempted to do all the movements involved in rowing at once, it really is a three-step process. To perfect your form, you should do each movement in the correct sequence.When you try to do all the movements in a stroke at once, you can put unnecessary strain on your upper body, which can lead to injury.
When you first start rowing, focus on pushing with your legs first, without moving your arms.
Get a good rhythm with your legs, then pull your arms back at the elbow. Your body should be leaned back slightly, with your wrists at your sides about where the bottom of a sports bra would be or where the bar would be when you bench press.
Get your arms engaged, keeping your back neutral and engaging the core to get all muscle groups working together.
Isolating movements not only can help you perfect your stroke, it also makes an effective warm-up. Do ""pick drills"" where you just use your legs for 15 to 20 strokes, then just use your arms for 15 to 20 strokes to warm up your muscles before getting into a more intense rowing workout., Rowing is meant to be a low-impact form of exercise, but that won't be the case if you're pushing your legs out too quickly, jerking around awkwardly, or banging your rear end into your heels with every stroke.Focus more energy into the start of each stroke, when your legs are pushing. The back half of the stroke should be more relaxed. Control your movements rather than trying to complete your stroke as quickly as possible.
Your upper body and lower body should be moving together smoothly. Engage your core to keep your upper and lower body working together. If you push too hard or go too fast with your legs, you'll have to jerk your upper body forward to keep up, which can lead to injury and drastically decreases the efficiency of your stroke.

, Using intervals is one of the quickest ways to build muscle while also burning significant numbers of calories. You decrease your total workout time by working out at maximum intensity in short bursts.For example, you might row a specified distance in one minute – start with 200 meters, then work your way up to further distances once it gets easier for you.
After you complete that distance, rest for one minute with slower rowing or an interval of another exercise or stretching.
Then do another one-minute interval of rowing, followed by a minute of rest. Keep up this rotation for 20 minutes, and you're done.

, Your rowing machine doesn't just have to be for rowing. You also can use the machine to increase the intensity and difficulty of body-weight exercises to build strength in multiple muscle groups. You can alternate these exercises in intervals with rowing.To do corkscrew crunches, sit on the rower seat and straighten your legs in front of you. Strap in your right foot, allowing your left foot to hover over the strap. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows out to the start and lean back about 45 degrees. Then raise and rotate your torso as you raise your left knee, bringing your right elbow to meet your left knee. Release to the starting position and repeat. Do 10 repetitions in a set, then switch sides.
Another exercise you can do using the rowing machine is a plank pike. Face away from the rowing machine in plank position with your palms flat on the floor behind the machine and your feet on the seat. Lift your hips and pull your feet toward your hands, then lower. Do two to three sets of 10 repetitions.
You also might try elevated climbers. Push the seat up to the front of the machine, then get in plank position perpendicular to the machine with your feet on the rail. Slowly pull your right knee to your chest, then return to the starting position. Switch and do your left knee to complete the repetition, then do an entire set of 10 repetitions.

, Going at maximum speed and intensity for 30 seconds to a minute, followed by briefer rest periods, will quickly fatigue your muscles and can help you get a better total-body workout in a shorter overall period of time.You may have heard of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). You can use the same principles for your rowing machine workout. This may be especially valuable if you have limited time each day to exercise.
Before you start high-intensity intervals, make sure you've perfected your form. Going at sprint speeds with poor form can overstrain muscles and lead to injury.
Warm up your body with easy rowing for 5 to 10 minutes before you begin sprint intervals. Sprint for 30 seconds at your maximum effort, then rest for 30 seconds. Complete 5 to 10 repetitions of this rotation.

, If you're doing brief one- or two-minute intervals, focus on the distance you're rowing. If you start by rowing 200 meters in one minute, pay attention to how your body feels. Increase the distance as that distance becomes easier to complete in the allotted time.While you don't want to completely wipe yourself out, particularly if you're doing several intervals, you should generally aim to increase the distance by 25 to 50 meters every couple of weeks.
Avoid setting your distance higher than you can accomplish with good form. Remember that strong form is the key to an efficient total-body rowing workout.

, There are several options available for indoor rowing machines. Some of them can get pretty pricey, but you don't necessarily have to invest a lot of money to get a good machine, especially if you're just starting out.If you're on a budget, look for hydraulic rowing machines, which get their tension from compressed air. However, keep in mind that these machines don't allow you to pull in a straight line, so you'll be unable to synchronize your upper and lower body. While they are economical machines, your workout may not be as efficient as with other machines.
Flywheel machines feel most similar to outdoor rowing, and allow you to perform a more natural rowing stroke. These machines are more expensive than hydraulic machines, and are most frequently found in gyms and fitness centers.
You also may want to look at magnetic resistance rowers, which make virtually no sound. This can be a benefit if you're working out at home and need to be able to hear what's going on around you.

, If you want to buy an indoor rowing machine to use at home and you don't have a dedicated fitness room, space may be your primary concern when choosing the rower you want to buy.Hydraulic machines typically take up the least amount of floor space, and you may be able to find a model that folds up for easier storage.

, If you have limited experience on a rowing machine, the best way to decide which machine is right for you is to try them all out. There may be one that just feels more comfortable to you, even if it's not the most popular brand or type of rower.While budgetary or space constraints may figure prominently into your overall decision, if you can't find a rowing machine that meets those requirements while also allowing you to complete repeated strokes comfortably, it may be better for you to wait rather than spending money on an exercise machine that doesn't fully meet your needs.
If the rowing machine you like the best happens to be out of your price range, it might be more economical to join a gym or health club that has those particular rowers. You typically can call different gyms and find out what kind of rowers they use.

, Since most gyms have several rowing machines, a gym membership may fit into your budget better than buying your own machine would. In addition, you'll probably get to use a better quality machine that you won't have to upgrade once your fitness level increases.Having trainers or others around with experience can help you tweak your form and get the most out of the rowing machines.
You also might consider joining a rowing class that meets once or twice a week. Many of these classes operate on intervals, giving you more intense training that you can carry over into your workout sessions at other times during the week.

Avoid sun damage to the skin by wearing protective clothing and applying sun screen.",How to Prevent Rowing Injuries," Always ensure that you are sitting correctly when rowing. Coordinate your rowing motion and maintain a good posture to avoid back injury. For instance, you should be sitting tall on your seat, with your head up and your eyes ahead. Make sure that your navel is pulled into your spine. If you have a rowing coach, ask about your technique and whether it needs improving.;
, If you already have injuries to your back, knees or wrists, then you need to accommodate for them. Contact your doctor or physical therapist to find out the best ways to protect these areas while still rowing.

, Avoid rowing pains by incorporating aerobic training to build flexibility, strength and endurance, in addition to a weight training session. Include a warm up period in your regimen that incorporates sustained stretches. Make sure you provide enough cool down time also, again adding stretches to your routine.

, Just make sure that you don't exert your body by practicing too much or pushing your body before it's prepared. Start off slowly and in short spurts so that your body becomes familiar with the rowing motion.

, Do this by incorporating exercises designed to strengthen your back. Additionally, if you strengthen your stomach muscles, they can take pressure off the back. Make a habit of caring for your back on a regular basis. Take care when lifting heavy objects, and recognize your personal limits when rowing.

, Opt to wear layers of light clothing that cover your body and protect your skin. You can remove layers as your body temperature increases. You should also wear sunglasses to protect your eyes and a hat.

",How to Pack for a Regatta (Rowing)," This will prevent you from forgetting your race gear or bringing too much stuff. If you are going overseas to the Henley or anything like that, find out whether or not you will be allowed to check any luggage.;
, I recommend a duffel with plenty of pockets, but not so many that you can't fit large items inside of the main compartment. Also pick out a sports bag for taking to the actual event. If owned, a bag with your team/organization's name on it can be helpful if it gets lost. Do bring at least two garbage bags, large enough to store your rowing bag. Label them using duct tape, otherwise they WILL be mistaken for trash.

, Also take a complete sweat suit, preferably with your team's name on it. We're talking sweat pants, a fleece/sweatshirt and a t-shirt. Do pack your sneakers, and at least one other pair of shoes. Bring underwear, sports socks, and, if applicable, sports and regular bras.

, Do remember that even though you are sharing your room with friends, they may not want to share. Take shampoo, body wash, deodorant, toothpaste, a comb, toothbrush, and, if applicable, feminine supplies, makeup, and skincare items. Put your toiletries in a waterproof bag so they won't get all over your clothing.

, You can roll, fold, or pack your clothing in packing cubes. Make sure not to forget your singlet and practice t-shirts, as with most clubs, there is a penalty for forgetting them. Put your toiletries and any accessories like jewelry or purses on top.

, The bus and car rides can be quite long!

, Power bars and such, along with chocolate (at least for me) and the occasional fresh piece of fresh fruit are all great ideas.

Make sure all of the oars are in so that they will not fall out (on the blade side of the part that goes into the oarlock, not the handle side) Tell the rowers to count down from bow when ready, 1-8.

,
Call ""one foot in"" and then ""and down."",
Once everyone is in the boat, call to push off the dock.,
Have bow four row to get away from the dock, and let stern four fix their feet.

,
Once stern four is ready, have them start the pick drill, or other drills, and have bow pair fix their feet.,
Continue to row, following whatever practice the coach tells you.,
Call some power tens.,
Spin the boat.,
Dock.",How to Cox an Eight Person Shell," If the boat is on a rack on or under shoulder level, get four rowers on each side of the boat- two at the stern, and two at the bow. Stagger the rowers so when you go up and over heads, people don't run into each other. If the boat is significantly above the rowers, get all the rowers under the boat (four at the stern, four at the bow) and call up and over heads. You may need to go to low heads at first to keep the boat from hitting the boats above.;
, After you do this, or if you do not have sliding racks, call up an inch and walk the boat out of racks. Once you have the boat out of the racks, call the rowers to show sides and split if you were over heads, or to go up to shoulders if you were carrying the boat at waist level.

, You should instruct each rower to watch the rigger in front of them. Once the stern is clear of any obstacles (normally the boathouse bay doors) you can call ""clear"" to let the crew know that they can start to swing the boat without fear of hitting the bay doors, and walk the boat right down to the river. Do not start to swing the boat until after you are clear of the bay doors. Make sure to walk it straight out. Continue to watch for obstacles as you walk down to the dock.

, When the official gives you the all clear, call the boat up to shoulders again.

, Then call ""up and over heads"" and then ""toes to the edge/ready to roll/and roll"" make sure that the rudder (or the skeg in smaller boats) is well clear of the dock, because if it breaks off, you will not be able to steer the boat.

, A good way of splitting is to say ""ports get oars, starboards get oarlocks"" or something like that. One person from each pair (1 and 2; 3 and 4; 5 and 6; 7 and 8) should get oars for the whole pair, while the other person stays and unlocks the oarlocks.

,, Make sure that your rowers keep one hand on the dock.

, This would be said ""one hand on the dock/ready to shove/and shove"" If needed, have the bow, dockside oars push off the dock with their oars. Make sure only the bow rowers do this!

,, Then, switch to bow pair.

, When making calls, call ""weigh enough"" when you want the rowers to stop. It is helpful to call ""in two/one/two"" when you want the rowers to do something, like weigh enough or put pressure. if you want the boat to go to the left, call starboard pressure. If you want the boat to go to the right, call port pressure. Stay to the right side of the river, close to the shore. Watch out for barges and motor boats.

, If your rowers are seeming sluggish, call a power ten. You can also call a focus ten, a timing ten, etc.

, When you are ready to spin, you should have all the rowers in the direction you are spinning towards check their oars and the rowers on the other side row. Then row the boat across and do the same thing on the other side.

, When you are docking, pay attention to the way the wind is moving and come in slowly, with only bow pair rowing. If there is someone on the dock, they can help to pull you in.

Add background shading to the tattoo.,
Avoid hiding it with a skin coloured dye.,
Cover up a scar or blowout with makeup.,
Wait for it to fade.",How to Get Rid of Tattoo Scarring and Blowouts1," Ask an experienced tattoo artist to add some additional shading to the tattoo in order to cover up the scarring or blowout. Typically, a blowout is visible on the outer most edge of a tattoo. To cover this up, you can expand on or add to the tattoo. Alternatively, you could add some background shading to cover the blowout. Choose a colour that matches with the tattoo., Some tattoo artists may suggest covering tattoo scars and blowouts with a skin coloured dye. You should not accept this advice. It will be extremely difficult to find a colour that completely matches your skin and this can actually make the tattoo look worse., In order to cover up a tattoo scar or blow out with makeup, you will need to first put a makeup primer over the area you wish to conceal. Then, using a brush, apply a base foundation that closely matches your skin colour. Next you will want to dab eye shadow on the area. Choose a darker colour such as orange or pink (depending on your skin tone). A dark colour is necessary to cover all of the ink.Then you will spray the area with hair spray to help lock the colour onto your skin.
When the hairspray is dry, dab on a concealer that matches your skin tone. Blend the concealer into the skin surrounding the tattoo.

, In some instances tattoo blowout will fade over time. Wait a year to see if the blowout and scarring is still noticeable. For instance, the blowout may eventually disperse over a large enough area that it is no longer visible.In some instances people may mistake a bruise as blowout. In these cases the bruise will fade and the tattoo will look fine.

Put in a smaller stud when the piercing heals.",How to Pierce Your Own Tongue," Commercial piercing kits are available with everything you'll need to pierce your tongue. A 14 gauge barbell is recommended for the tongue. To do the job properly, you'll need:


1 sterilized 14-gauge piercing needle or cannula (a hollow needle using in piercing)
1 new 14-gauge steel tongue barbell-style piercing
surgical forceps
sterile latex surgical gloves
You should never attempt to pierce your tongue with anything other than a sterile piercing needle or cannula, and should never stud the piercing with anything but a new barbell-style piercing.Good quality piercing kits are sometimes cheaper than having your tongue pierced at the shop, but not necessarily. Usually it's not worth it in terms of value and effort. If you've got a shop you trust, you can have your tongue pierced by a professional, in and out in probably less than 20 minutes.;
, Make sure that you clean everything that you are going to be using with rubbing alcohol. The stud, the forceps, and especially the needle need to be cleaning thoroughly and then sterilized.


It should go without saying, though it bears repeating: Never reuse piercing needles and only use needles specifically used for piercing if you're going to try to pierce your own tongue.

, Before you try to pierce anything, it's important to brush your teeth thoroughly and rinse your mouth out with a gentle anti-bacterial non-alcoholic mouthwash.

, Wash your hands with soap and water, then sterilize them with hand sanitizer and put on some clean, disposable latex gloves.

, While some people with their tongue pierced say that the tongue piercing is one of the least painful piercings you can get, and that it hurts even less than biting your tongue, it still involved jabbing a needle all the way through part of your body. It's no walk in the park. Anticipate the pain of the needle so you don't get halfway through and stop.

, Two significant veins run alongside the bottom of your tongue, either of which--if pierced--will bleed significantly and might cause a dangerous situation in which you'll need to visit the hospital and receive vascular repair. It's an expensive and potentially life-threatening possibility.


Examine the underside of your tongue for the veins, and consider marking the safe spot between the veins with a small marker., The ideal piercing is centered back on the tongue far enough to be out of the way of the primary tastebuds, well clear of any veins that might be in danger of getting stuck.


It's important to check and double check for the possibility of sticking yourself somewhere that will bleed significantly and risk vascular damage. If, when you pierce your tongue, it continues bleeding significantly, visit the hospital immediately.

, Push the needle in straight and firm, using enough steady pressure to get it completely through the tongue. Do not remove the needle from your tongue until you've inserted the bar.



If you're using a solid piercing needle, most piercers like to go from the top of the tongue to the bottom of the tongue.

If you're using a cannulated needle, most piercers like to go from the bottom of the tongue to the top of the tongue.

, Before you pull the needle all the way through and remove it, pull it gently to the side and insert the bar into the hole. Holding it in place, remove the piercing needle.

, Screw the balls on the barbell piercing, making sure it the piercing is comfortable and the balls securing it are tight.

, Wipe up any blood that is on your tongue and rinse your mouth with mouthwash. The mouthwash may sting quite a bit, and it's very important to use non-alcoholic mouthwash that's very gentle. Most piercing shops sell a particular brand of mouthwash recommended for piercing care, usually Tech 2000 or Biotene.

, Typically, the tongue will swell some after being pierced. For some people, it's quite unnoticeable, for some it can be quite alarming. To manage the pain over the next few days, as well as any swelling you might experience, befriend a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen and suck on ice chips to help numb your tongue and keep the swelling down.


Many people with tongue piercings find it helpful to suck on ice cubes immediately afterwards. This can help the swelling from starting, and numb the initial pain.

, You don't need to remove the piercing and clean it. The piercing will heal best when left alone. Focus on keeping your mouth clean, not messing with the piercing itself. As tempting as it may be, don't try to remove it to inspect the healing process, and mess with it as little as possible. Let your mouth heal itself.

, Use a gentle mouthwash and rinse out your mouth regularly to lower your risk of infection. Alternate salt-water rinses with mouthwash.


Saliva has strong antibacterial properties that work to keep your mouth clean, but your mouth is still subject to lots of incoming risk of infection. Take care to clean it out and don't risk a painful infection.

, You'll be able to manage the pain and avoid the risk of infection much more easily if you stick to juice and other foods you can sip for the first two days, at least. Listen to your body, but it's usually best if you avoid chewing and get used to the bar in your mouth for a while before trying to eat solid food.

, As your tongue starts to heal, avoid alcohol and smoke, which can agitate the wound and keep it from healing like it should. To be on the safe side, avoid them.

, One unexpectedly difficult issue that many newly-pierced people experience is that it's somewhat difficult to speak without a slight lisp, or feeling as if you've got a hard candy in your mouth at all times.


The best way to speak properly: ignore it. Try your best to stop ""holding"" the bar as if it were a piece of candy, and just leave it alone as best you can. You'll instinctively try to keep the stud in your mouth, which you don't need to do. It's not going anywhere.

, Total recovery can take up to a month, depending on the job and the person. When it starts to feel comfortable, it's good to switch to a smaller and more comfortable tongue stud than the one you used to get the piercing started. Change the bar to a smaller bar in about two weeks when the swelling has gone down.

Rinse your hands under warm water and then apply soap. Scrub your hands for approximately 20 seconds and then rinse the soap off with warm running water.Sing happy birthday while scrubbing your hands to ensure that you scrub for at least 20 seconds.;
, Prior to removing the piercing, you should rinse your mouth with mouthwash in order to sanitize the hole surrounding the piercing. Use an antiseptic rinse such as Listerine or Scope. To use mouthwash:Pour 4 teaspoons of mouthwash into a cup.
Empty the cup into your mouth.
Swish the mouthwash around for 30 seconds and gargle while swishing.
Spit the mouthwash into the sink.

, Use your fingers to remove any crust that may have built up around the outside of the piercing. This way when you remove the piercing the crust will not get stuck in the hole. This could lead to an infection., Rubber gloves will help you grip the piercing while you are removing it from your upper lip. If you do not use gloves you may find it hard to gain traction and maintain a steady grip on the back of the jewelry."

Give the piercing time to heal.",How to Hide a Lip Piercing from Parents or Bosses," If your piercing has completely healed and you've removed the jewelry, dab silicone primer over the hole. A silicone primer should go on smoothly over the hole and help fill it in a little. Primer will also help cover any blemishes or red areas on your face.You can also put a little concealer over the primer to create the look of an even skin tone.;
, Scar wax will be thick and difficult to work with right out of the container. Take a little out and warm it between your fingers to soften it and make it easier to apply. Thin the wax out so you can cover the hole and surrounding skin with the wax. Place a little spirit gum to the side of the scar wax that you'll place on the skin. Firmly, put the piece over the hole and use foundation to blend in the edges with the rest of your makeup.


You can also find scar wax that comes in a tube, which may be easiest to use in small amounts. You can find scar wax and spirit gum at beauty supply stores, costume stores, or online.
Spirit gum is a quick-drying adhesive used to attach prosthetics or makeup.

, For many people, the hole from a lip piercing won't be very large or noticeable. But, if you'll be talking with your parents or boss and fear they'll see the hole up close, you can always cover it with a bandage. Wear a small circular blister bandage so you don't end up with a large bandage covering most of your lower face.


If your piercing is still healing, you'll need to keep the jewelry. A bandage might be a good option for concealing the piercing as well. Just make sure that the bandage isn't pulling the piercing down or getting the jewelry sticky with adhesive., Since the piercing isn't flush with your skin, makeup may actually make the piercing stand out more. Makeup can introduce bacteria and cause infection if you use it while the piercing is still healing.


You should also cover the pierced area with toilet paper or a tissue when you apply hair spray. This will prevent any from accidentally getting into the piercing.

, Once the piercing has healed, you can wear a clear retainer. The retainer is smaller than a stud and designed to hide your piercing while keeping the hole filled. You should never use a retainer in the first few days after getting your piercing.


Always keep the piercing filled with jewelry or a retainer while it's healing. The opening of the piercing can close up quickly if you remove the jewelry.You can also find retainers in a variety of skin tones or beauty marks.

, You might feel like everyone is staring at your piercing. To ease your mind and take the focus off of your lip piercing, wear distracting clothing or accessories. Instead of noticing your piercing, your parents or boss may be too busy paying attention to your stylish new look.


For example, wear large bright scarves, bandanas or necklaces. You could also wear fun patterned ties or shirts to draw the eye away from your face.

, If you're talking to your parents or boss, it may seem like a good idea to hold your chin in your hand and cover your mouth. But, touching your piercing area can introduce bacteria and cause an infection. To keep your piercing site healthy and clean, avoid touching, picking, or playing with the jewelry.Bringing your hands to your lip may actually draw attention to your mouth and the piercing instead of concealing it.

, If you're a man and are planning on hiding the lip piercing for quite a while, you could grow facial hair. This will easily cover a clear retainer if you have a labret piercing.If you do grow facial hair to cover the piercing, you'll still need to maintain good hygiene by washing and cleaning the pierced area on a regular basis.

, If you're under 18, many states require your parent or legal guardian to give permission before you're pierced. This usually means that your parent or legal guardian will have to accompany you and sign a consent form in person. Your parent or guardian might need to give state-issued photo identification or court documentation to prove your relationship.You can easily search your state's tattoo and piercing laws using an online database., The skin around your lip piercing will be noticeably irritated for a few days after you get the piercing done. Your skin may appear bruised or swollen and the piercing may discharge a white fluid. Because of these hard to conceal signs, plan to get the piercing when you can avoid your parents or boss for several days. If you can't completely avoid contact, try to keep your distance until the piercing heals.


While the initial healing process takes several days, it will take 2 to 3 months for a lip piercing to completely heal., Ask the piercer to use this material because it's less noticeable than a metal loop or stud. Some piercers can safely use bioplast for your initial piercing. But, if your piercer isn't willing to work with this material, choose a plain stud.


You've probably heard that you can hide a piercing by wearing a retainer. Although this is true, you can't use a retainer to get the piercing.

, Follow the cleaning instructions that the piercer gave you. You'll probably need to wash the piercing with antibacterial soap, wear clean clothes, and change your sheets frequently to prevent infection. To keep your mouth healthy, use an antibacterial mouthwash that doesn't contain alcohol. Don't clean the skin around your piercing with rubbing alcohol or peroxide. These can dry your skin out.You should also avoid kissing or oral sex while your lip piercing heals., You might need to tell someone about your piercing and get medical attention if the piercing becomes infected. An infection probably will not clear up on its own and could become serious if left untreated. Keep the piercing in (since removing the stud could trap the infection) and see a doctor if you experience any of the following:Pain that doesn't go away after a day or two
Pain that's getting worse
Unusual pain or swelling in the pierced area
Yellow or green discharge (white is fine)
Bleeding or tearing near the pierced area
Fever

, It will be easier to hide the piercing once it's healed for a few days. The swelling won't be as noticeable and eventually you'll be able to wear retainers or posts that hide the piercing. Avoid rushing to conceal the piercing, since you may increase the risk of infection.If you need to buy yourself some time, you may want to use sick days. This way, you'll be able to rest up while avoiding your parents or boss.

They are trained in proper techniques, safety, and sanitation to ensure that your new piercing is placed properly and heals well., If you are trying to keep your new piercing a secret, you need to be mindful about when you get it done. There will be a healing timeframe during which your tongue may swell significantly which can noticeably alter how you sound when you talk. Try to plan your piercing during a time when you can avoid people for at least a few days to give yourself time to heal.

, Make sure you follow all instructions given to you by the piercer for care of your new piercing. Failure to do so could result in infection or a prolonged healing time, which would make your situation and your pierced tongue more noticeable to those around you., There are many fun kinds of jewelry you can get for your new tongue piercing.

, Try to pick a clear plastic ball or a flesh-colored ball for the ends of your tongue piercing barbell. These will be less obvious than flashy metal or a colorful ball, so they are easier to hide.

, The best way to minimize visibility of a new piercing is by getting a clear plastic retainer. These are much harder to see, especially in a darker place like inside your mouth. However, these plastic jewelry options are not good for fresh piercings. You need to give your tongue piercing several months of healing time before you use any plastic jewelry in it., People talk. The more people who know about your tongue piercing, the more likely it is that someone you don’t want to know will find out about it. Don’t tell anyone you don’t trust and avoid talking about your piercing in general if you want it to remain a secret.

, Tongue piercings can be difficult to hide because they are in such a visible area. Avoid opening your mouth too widely when you are talking or laughing. Avoid yelling, screaming, or singing (or other activities that require you to open your mouth widely) in front of people you want to hide the piercing from. Practice in the mirror to see what methods conceal your piercing the most.

, When possible, avoid the people you don’t want to know about your new piercing. It would be a better idea to take some days off work while your piercing heals than to go to work with an obviously swollen tongue.

Some retainers come with a decorative ending that you can use when you are not trying to camouflage the piercing., Wet the piercing with a little bit water.

Fake nose hoop rings work differently. They come with a small spring that looks like a disc. The spring clips the nose ring onto the nose. These fake nose rings look real to most people.

, You can get these at common accessory stores. Take a hair straightener, and melt the little ball at the end so it’s flat and sets against your skin.

,,, The hardest thing here is keeping the pin straight so you get a straight hole. It's easy to end up with a piercing at an angle - so be careful. If you are piercing your upper ear or through cartilage, be prepared for a weird crunching sound as you break through. Wonky piercings are the most common problem from DIY jobs - so really - be careful! If you don't have the stomach to do it properly, take it out and get a professional to do it for you. You don't want weird sideways holes through your ears. Note in the picture the model has holes that slant upwards. Also you will want the closure of the pin to be at the front of the ear since this will the the easiest part of the pin for bacteria to collect and you will want to keep an eye on it.

, Remember not to double dip if using a container!

, Leave it alone, only twisting it once or twice a day and disinfecting it. Don't touch it with your grotty fingers all the time.

, This means if you put a stud or sleeper in straight away or after it has healed, it will be a lot less painful then if you DIY pierce with a needle.

Understand the purpose of massage oils.,
Learn about the best oils.,
Select the oil suited to your needs and budget.,
Consider other base oils.,
Understand the difference between base massage oils and aromatherapy essential oils.,
Try the most popular aromatherapy oils.",How to Understand Massage Oils," The main purpose of massage oils is to lubricate the skin to reduce friction while performing a massage. This helps give a smooth glide and easy workability to the skin surface. Some of the secondary benefits include nourishing the skin and acting as a ""base"", or ""carrier"" oil for aromatherapy essential oils.;
, The different attributes we can compare are how the oil spreads, how easily it is absorbed, its nourishing and moisturizing properties and the smell. Other factors to consider are the cost, the ease of cleaning, and the way it is processed. Generally speaking, the best oil will be extra virgin cold pressed, as this process maintains the highest level of purity while retaining most of the natural nutrients.

, There are several basic oils that are most popular for massage:



Almond oil: probably the most widely used massage oil is sweet almond oil. It spreads easily, and is very nourishing to the skin. It also serves as an excellent carrier oil because the smell is not too overpowering. It can be found in most health food stores and body shops, and is reasonably priced.

Grapeseed oil: Another popular oil is grape seed. It is easily absorbed by the skin but does not leave a “greasy” feeling after application. It is not as common as sweet almond and is usually a bit more expensive.

Sunflower oil: Sunflower oil is a low cost alternative and can usually be found at your local grocery store. It spreads easily and is a good carrier oil, but can feel a little greasy afterwards. Another thing to consider is that the majority of sunflower oils are heat pressed and have a very short shelf life.

, Other base oils have certain properties that can help specific conditions like dry skin, premature aging or eczema. These can be added in varying proportions to the primary oil and some examples include olive oil, wheat germ, and jojoba.

, Aromatherapy essential oils differ from the base oils in several ways.


These are highly concentrated “essences” derived from various plant and fruit sources which have profound effects on the systems of the body.

, There many essential oils to choose from, each with specific properties that affect the body differently. Here are some of the most popular oils whose effects are beneficial to massage and relaxation:



Lavender oil: Lavender is probably the most well known and widely used of all the essential oils. Not only does it have a calming effect on the mind, it is also an antiseptic and is one of the two oils that you can apply directly to the skin in cases of burns or stings to ease the pain. You can find lavender oil in almost any health food store, as well in many cosmetic shops and other skin care centres.

Ylang Ylang: Ylang Ylang might possibly be the most useful essential oil for doing massage. Its properties include a sedating effect on the nervous system which helps with relaxation, while stimulating blood circulation and the production of endorphins, the body's natural pain killers. It is also perfect for all skin types as it helps dry skin conditions as well as oily skin and acne.

Tea tree oil: Tea tree oil is the only other essential oil you can apply undiluted to areas of the skin as an antiseptic as well as an anti-inflammatory. When used in massage, it helps promote healing to damaged skin while supporting healthy functioning of the respiratory system.

Eucalyptus oil: Finally, eucalyptus oil is also one of the more commonly used essential oils for massage because of its anti inflammatory properties that help treat muscle cramps, spasms and sprains. It also helps with skin problems and even has the ability to prevent and heal scar tissue. Add all this to its ability to help open blocked nasal passages and stimulate the senses, and you have a versatile oil that helps on many levels.

Avoid touching on or around a piercing for at least 24 hours after you get it.,
Know the signs of normal healing.,
Choose your approved aftercare routine.,
Get rid of crusties.,
Shower to help clean your piercing.,
Mitigate trauma to the area.,
Keep away from dirty bodies of water.,
Be patient.,
Sleep on clean bedding.,
Stay healthy.,
Be on the lookout for signs of an infection.",How to Clean a Body Piercing," Even after those 24 hours are over, you should always wash your hands before touching your piercing. Foreign substances like dirt and hand oil can aggravate the healing process and eventually lead to infection. In fact, you should avoid touching your piercing at all times except cleaning.;
, While it's good to be extra cautious, knowing the signs of normal healing will help ease your mind about infection and will keep you from over-cleaning your new piercing. Here are a couple of symptoms that are part of the normal healing process:


Bleeding, swelling, tenderness, and bruising. Small amounts of bleeding and localized swelling are expected right after you get a new piercing. These can often also lead to tenderness and bruising. While these four things are normal in moderation, call your piercer if they are excessive or if the bleeding and bruising continue for more than a week after you get your new piercing (Be aware that genital piercings may bleed freely for the first few days).
Itching and discoloration. Itching is common in any healing process, partly because of new skin growth. Discoloration can often be caused by a whitish-yellow fluid secreted from the piercing. This is called lymph and is nothing to be worried about. However, if you start to notice pus around the piercing you should call your piercer immediately.

, Most professional piercers recommend sea salt soaks once or twice a day for several weeks after the piercing.If you find the method you are using is starting to irritate the skin around the piercing, ask your piercer about other methods.


The saline soak will be easier with some piercings than with others. For lobes, just submerge the piercing in a cup of warm salt water. For belly button piercings, quickly flip a small cup of saline solution upside down over the piercing to create a vacuum for the piecing to soak in. For most other piercings, it's effective to saturate clean gauze or paper towels with the solution and then apply to the piercing.
Make sure the solution gets all the way IN the piercing, not just around it. Though you don't want to rotate the jewelry, you do want to get close enough to the jewelry to ensure the saline solution is getting all the way in the hole. Otherwise, you risk infection inside the piercing.
Use a pressurized can of saline solution. This can be used instead of or in addition to the saline soak; ask your piercer for the benefits of each. Blairex is the most common pressurized saline solution out there and can be purchased from any drug stores, like Walgreens or Rite Aid.
Some people choose to wash the piercing with warm water and a gentle soap as well. If you decide to do this, soap no more than one to two times a day. The best way to use soap to clean your piercing is in the shower: use a pearl sized squirt of mild soap and gently clean the piercing. Rinse the soap off after 15 to 30 seconds.
Avoid harmful techniques and products. There are some cleaning techniques that should be avoided, even if they sound like a good idea to you.

Over-cleaning. Believe it or not, you can over-clean your piercing. Limit your cleaning routine to twice a day to avoid irritation and dryness.
Harsh soaps and anti-bacterial products. Dial, Betadine, Hibiclens, and hydrogen peroxide can all damage your healing cells and dry out the piercing, encouraging crusty buildup. Rubbing alcohol should be avoided for the same reason.
Ointments. Healing ointments restrict necessary airflow and will delay the healing process of your piercing.



, A clear, yellowish fluid (lymph) will come out of the piercing as part of the healing process. Without daily cleanings, this fluid will crust around the piercing, creating unnecessary tension. Be sure to gently clean these off periodically by soaking a towel or Q-Tip in the saline solution and gently rubbing the area. Never force the crusties off.


If you use a Q-Tip or cotton bud, make sure it is fully saturated, and there are no loose fibers to get caught in your piercing. If you do get fibers in your piercing, remove them immediately to avoid irritation. Avoid using cotton balls. Never remove crusties with your fingers—unnecessary touching can lead to infection.

, Showering can also help - direct water stream can help to loosen crusties/remove dirt. Be careful with surrounding area, and talk to your piercer about what kind of soap and shampoo to use in the shower.


Avoid taking baths for the first few weeks after getting your piercing. Baths and bathtubs tend to harbor bacteria that can get trapped in your piercing and cause infection. If you must take a bath, clean the tub well before you get in. Rinse and clean your piercing when you get out.

, Never touch or play with your piercing outside of cleaning it. Avoid friction/rough play, oral contact, and contact with other's bodily fluids. If a body piercing, wear loose-fitting clothing over it until healed. If on the ears, wear hair in a way that it will not get caught on the piercing.

, Lakes, pools, hot tubs, and other possibly harmful bodies of water should be avoided until your piercing is healed. Like bath tubs, these harbor bacteria that can encourage infections in your piercing. If you have to swim, find a waterproof bandage such as Nexcare Clean Seals.

, Remember that piercings heal from the outside in. Therefore, a piercing may seem healed before it is. Removing or changing the jewelry can cause tearing inside the piercing, forcing you to restart the healing process.


Never force your jewelry. If you fail to clean every day, smelly secretions may build up inside the piercing, making it hard to move the jewelry. Instead of forcing it, which may cause inner breakage of the healed skin, continue cleaning until you can easily remove the piercing.

, Be extra vigilant about changing your sheets and pillowcases. Always wear clean and breathable clothing when you sleep. Allowing airflow will help bring oxygen to the piercing, thus helping the wound heal healthily and quickly.

, As with any wound, the healing process will happen faster if your body isn't working to fight other problems or infections. Thus, keeping yourself and your body happy and healthy will help keep your piercing happy and healthy.


Exercise. With some exceptions, exercise is fine during the healing process. Be sure to clean any sweat that may accumulate in the piercing, and listen to your body.
Avoid excessive recreational drug use. This includes nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine.
Avoid stress. Too much stress in your life will also cause stress on your body, slowing the healing process.

, Expect your healed piercing to seem healthy and happy every day, unless it was bumped or pulled on or has had some accident. If you experience pain, swelling, or discharge it is important to contact your piercer or you will be at risk or losing your piercing or causing damage to your body.

, Do not worry about thinking of a lot of characters, and focus on creating good quality characters. More ideas, and thus, more characters will come to you, but value quality over quantity.

, Think about how your character feels, what she/he looks like, and their personality.

, Describe it. Is it in a park or at a factory? Is it sunny or raining? The little details are very important, because they give the work unity and clarity.


Write down the setting place and time for every new scene. When something changes in a scene, record it. You would not want the screenplay to get its chronology mixed up!

, This will make it easy for the actors and actresses to study and practice their lines, and it erases confusion from the mix in the hectic play preparation process.

, Make them fit with your characters' personality and emotions, and make sure that they are not bland or insipid. Be creative, and avoid using overly-dramatic scenes (unless it is a melodrama). Do not necessarily subscribe to theatrical cliches either (Male hero attempting to save a helpless princess). In other words, adapt the play to modern times and avoid centering it on over-used, tired story lines.

, If you are in your school drama program, this will be done for you. If you are allowed to pick the actors and actresses yourself, avoid giving positions only to friends. Choose whomever you know that could play the part well.

, Whether you are performing the play at your school, or with siblings at home, ensure that you are ready and prepared. Do not expect for everything to work perfectly the first time, but persevere even if it was a disaster! If you begin to write very good screenplays, you may have a future job as a Hollywood movie director."

Put both of the oils together.",How to Make Your Own Massage Oils," That is the basic ingredient that provides most of the liquid in massage oil. These are usually vegetable based, and have different properties that may impact your choice. You can usually find these at the grocery store.


Grape seed oil:

a light, gentle, emollient oil with a low odour and good penetration. Readily absorbed by the skin and carries a low risk of allergy. Especially popular with professional massage therapists.


Jojoba oil:

not an oil , but a liquid wax, with natural moisturizing and healing properties and suitable for all skin types. Like grapeseed oil, it is not a nut oil so very suitable for those with sensitive skin.


Avocado oil:

An excellent carrier oil for those with mature skin, or conditions that require special care. Re-hydrates and nourishes sun dried skin, and is easily absorbed


Almond oil:

very moisturizing, rich in essential fatty acids and vitamins A & E. Light both in odour and colour and while it is suitable for all skin types, is particularly useful for dry or sensitive skin.


Apricot Kernel:

similar to sweet almond oil chemically, but with a wonderfully light consistency and aroma making it particularly suitable for facial massage and treatments.


Wheat germ oil:

renowned for its high content of Vitamin E, an antioxidant, as well as fatty acids and is particularly useful for dry or mature skin.


Hazelnut oil:

Has no taste or smell to overpower other fragrances. It penetrates deeply, and has great moisturizing capacity

;
, Essential oils are highly concentrated, and are used at a blend of two or three drops to a batch of oil. They are also prone to breaking down under temperature or light extremes, and should be stored in colored glass bottles, in a cool, dry location. Some good essential oils are:

Be prepared to give up some of your favorite foods if you're into spicy dishes- such as curry, or hot wings.,
For the first few days, most piercers actually suggest you stick to cold, soothing foods, such as ice cream.,
You don't realize how often you use your tongue to push food around your mouth as you chew.,
After carefully following this regimen for one to two weeks- the time varies from person to person, depending on your immune system, diet, etc.- your tongue should be significantly healed, and able to handle solid food again!",How to Eat with a Tongue Piercing," Don't worry, you will be able to eat them once your piercing heals a bit more- but immediately after getting pierced, eating/drinking something very acidic (such as lemonade), or eating something fiery (such as jalapenos) will sting and burn your tongue, causing you a lot of pain. Right after getting your piercing done, it's recommended that you only consume cold liquids for at least a few hours. Try to avoid carbonated drinks- if you're very worried, water is always a safe bet.;
, However, if you are lactose intolerant or have been advised to avoid dairy, water ice is a delicious alternative.

, Once your piercing is able to handle warm foods, and not just frozen ones, begin eating foods that are soft, or involve little to no chewing. Brothy soups and applesauce are a good idea.

, That aside, it's advisable to avoid foods that could become troublesome unless you have mouthwash or a bottle of water on hand to swish with, such as popcorn (the kernels and little bits of it can easily get trapped on or around your piercing). No matter what you eat, be sure to use alcohol-free mouthwash after every meal while out of the house (consider buying a lot of those handy travel-size bottles), as having food stuck around your piercing greatly increases your risk of infection- and is a not-so-flattering look. While at home, you should still use mouthwash after meals, but not necessarily every time you eat, as using mouthwash too often will destroy the natural enzymes in your mouth which kill bacteria.

This can be helpful during the first few days, and can also reduce swelling. Apply something cold, like a bag of frozen peas, or an ice pack to the area during downtime throughout the day.Keep in mind, you may want to place a clean, dry rag over the ice pack or cold object to prevent infection. This can also help prevent freezer burn.
Do not leave the ice on for more than 20 minutes at a time.;
, Many people advocate a chamomile compress as a way to help soothe and potentially prevent scarring. You will need a bag of chamomile tea.Boil some water and immerse the tea bag in the water. After several minutes, remove the tea bag.
Let the tea bag cool for a few minutes. Then, apply the tea bag to your piercing, in the area where you feel pain.

, If you got your lip pierced, eating and drinking something cool can help. Try ice cream, cold water, cold beverages, popsicles, frozen yogurt, and other cold items to ease the pain.There may be certain foods that irritate your skin. If anything you're eating seems to aggravate the piercing, try something else.

, A simple over-the-counter painkiller can help get rid of the pain of a new piercing. Try something like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if the pain is getting bad. This can reduce pain and also take away some swelling.Make sure to check that any chosen painkiller does not interact poorly with existing medications first.
Read the label of any medications to make sure to take the painkillers at the correct dosage.

, When you get a new piercing, you will go home with a set of instructions for care. It is important to follow these instructions carefully. Your piercing will hurt for longer if you don't encourage it to heal properly.Usually, you will have to clean your piercing at least once a day. Some piercings may need to be cleaned more frequently. Before cleaning, wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap.
Your piercer should have given specific instructions for cleaning. Usually, you rinse the piercing in warm water and a saline solution and then clean off any crust using a cotton swab.
Cleaning is very important. It keeps the area free of bacteria that can cause an infection.

, You may be tempted to touch or twist your new piercing. This will irritate the area, causing more pain. Also, touching your piercing with dirty hands greatly increases your risk of an infection., Do not take the piercing out before the healing period has passed. When you get your piercing, your piercer will let you know how many weeks the piercing needs to stay in place. Until this time has passed, do not remove the piercing for any reasons. This will delay the healing process, and putting the piercing back in place may cause pain., If you suspect your piercing is infected, talk to a doctor or return to your piercer. Do not attempt to fix the infection on your own with hydrogen peroxide. This kills healing cells and can cause crust to build up around your piercing., If you handle the piercing for any reason, wash your hands. Use clean, warm water and antibacterial soap. Touching a piercing without clean hands is a major cause of infection.Try to wash your hands for about 20 seconds.
Make sure to get all areas of your hands clean. Pay attention to the backs of your hands, under your fingernails, and between your fingers.

, Regular salt water soaks can promote healing and prevent infection. You may get salt water solution from your piercer. You can also mix a teaspoon of salt (about 5 milliliters) into 8 ounces (about .2 liters) of water and mix thoroughly.Soak a q-tip or cotton swab in the salt water. Place it on the piercing for a few seconds and then discard.
Repeat this process for 5 to 6 minutes.
Do this twice a day for about a month or until your piercing is fully healed.

, Swimming after a piercing is a bad idea. Chlorine from pool water, and contaminants from open water, can irritate a piercing and cause infection. Refrain from swimming until your piercing is fully healed., Keep foreign objects away from the pierced area while you wait for it to heal. Do not, for example, wear a hat if you have an eyebrow piercing. You should always be aware of your hair if it's longer. Keep long hair from touching the piercing. You may have to pull your hair back more often as the piercing heals.Avoid sleeping on the side of your body where the piercing is. Bacteria from your pillow can cause an infection.If you have something like a navel piercing, talk to your piercer on how to best protect it. You may have to wear gauze over the piercing or loose-fitting clothing.

, Use a small 3-D sticker for top part of the jewel, and a somewhat larger one for the bottom part (which goes into the belly button). Use nail polish or craft paint (and a small, slim brush) to paint stickers. Use clear nail polish to coat stickers if the craft paint you're using is matte. This creates an attractive plastic-y effect. Paint a little design (e.g. star, heart, stripes, dots,animal print, etc.) on larger sticker. Use glow-in-the-dark nail polish to create a glow-in-the-dark-effect. Paint a few coats of it onto the two stickers for the best effect; this is great on scary images such as skulls (stud or dangly) and on neon-colored jewelry.

, Make a small metallic sticker for top part of jewel (see step # 2 for how to do this). Use a medium sized (or even large) craft gem or 3-D metallic sticker to glue into your navel. Avoid overly large stones (e.g. 10 mm.), unless you're a belly dancer.:-). Also, try delicate, graceful crystal design stickers for the bottom part of jewel.

, Use Dazzle Tape, or 3-D stickers, and gems or beads. Use silver, gold or black thread for the dangling, or even use transparent thread for a trompe l'oeil, floating effect. Cut smallish piece of thread (e.g. 2 inches long), and stick one end of thread between 2 Dazzle stickers (or a 3-D sticker and a Dazzle Dot). Stick gems and stickers towards the other end of thread with Scotch tape or a Dazzle sticker. Make jewel as long or short as you like (but it shouldn't be longer than 1.5-2 inches!). Form thread into a loop shape to string a bead (or beads) onto it. Use a small metallic sticker or a small gem for top part of jewel (just above the navel). Make a dangle jewel with two or three threads, if you like.

,, This jewel is a lot like the plastic-like stud navel jewel, but the bottom part (that goes in your navel) is a bit larger and has a word or picture in it.

Cut it out and cut it into a circle shape, and stick it onto the back of a larger 3-D sticker. Coat with 2-3- coats of clear polish.

, Shape wire in to a small circle (to make loop). Twist remaining wire around loop to seal, and snip off the rest of wire. Add small gem or pendant, and stick on with a Dazzle Dot sticker. Shape a short bit of wire into a round U shape for a horseshoe ring, and add small gems or 3-D stickers to each end. Secure these two types of jewel with a Dazzle dot, cut in half to be smaller, and stick just above your navel.

, Use a smallish, transparent no-slip stopper that's dome shaped. (these ""stoppers"" are those items people put on the inside of, say, cabinet doors so that the doors don't slam noisily). Use a small, slim brush to paint little shapes (e.g. stars) on the back of the stopper. Paint a bit of glitter paint on the back of the stopper. Make sure the glitter paint is the ""clear with glitter"" kind, not the opaque kind. Stick something transparent and sticky (e.g. Scotch tape) on that back of the stopper (after the paint has dried). This will ""seal"" the jewel. Put this jewel in your navel, not above it.

Brainstorm about the possible combinations of oils.,
Make a note of your ideas for suitable blends in a book made specifically for your creative endeavours.,
Ensure that the blends you choose are hypoallergenic.,
Calculate the costs.,
Make a recipe book for your best and favorite massage oil blends.,
Set aside some time to prepare for the steps involved to make massage oil.,
Pour the carrier oil(s) you have chosen to use into a suitable container.,
Add aromatherapy products.,
Store the oils properly.",How to Make Massage Oil for All Skin Types," What creative ideas do you have to create your special blend of massage oil?;
, Keeping notes will help you to replicate the exact blend again should you discover one that works well.

, Making a massage oil for all skin types requires using ingredients that are hypoallergenic, which means that there is a low likelihood of the oils causing an allergic reaction. You must consider both the carrier oil(s) and the essential oil(s) added to make the blend.


While nut- and peanut-derived oils are usually not allergenic for most skin types, they are highly allergenic to those who have a nut allergy, and are best avoided unless you are absolutely certain the users do not have such an allergy.Carrier oils that you might consider using that are popular for massage blends and that tend to have low allergenic properties include: grape seed oil, soybean oil, corn oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, avocado oil, apricot oil, sweet almond oil (but see note on nuts above), sunflower oil, evening primrose oil, etc.Coconut oil can irritate the skin of persons prone to acne.Essential oils that are low in allergic reactions will depend on which oil but basically, a true essential oil should be hypoallergenic. If an essential oil is marked synthetic or fragrance oil, do not use it, as it will provoke an allergic reaction in susceptible people. Avoid any so-called essential oil that seems to be too cheap compared to what the oil normally fetches, as it's likely to be synthetic. Beware ""single note"" oils too, such as peach scented or apple blossom scented, as these are likely to be synthetic. Moreover, read up carefully on the properties of each essential oil you intend to add. Even though the essential oil is pure, it may still have contraindications for certain persons, such as the sick, the elderly and pregnant women. Some companies will make it very clear on their product that the essential oil is hypoallergenic, especially those using organic sources and processes. Note that some essential oils are produced with linalool, which can irritate the skin of sensitive persons.
You might prefer to choose organic sources for everything you use in the massage blend. This can make for a great selling point or be persuasive with a reluctant family member, although it will raise the cost.

, Tally the cost of ingredients, tools and equipment. This is especially important if you're making blends as part of your massage business or for craft stall sales, as the products used can soon add up.

, Be sure to include the amount of each ingredient used, the costs, tools, equipment and time requirements.

, You'll need at least a half an hour or so to make the oils in any one sitting.

, The container should preferably be made of glass or ceramic and it must be opaque and dark, to help protect the oils from light damage (which can cause oils to go rancid quickly). 


Use a funnel to help you pour in the carrier oil(s).

, Use natural ingredients to scent the massage oil, such as essential oil(s), dried peel, flower buds, etc. Since this is for all skin types, you'll need to consider avoiding any scents that might irritate some persons, such as anything too flowery, too musky or too strong.

, Decide the method you will use to preserve the oil, for example, a dark glass or ceramic bottle or jar. Label the bottle and date it, so that you remember what it contains and how old it is. Also add any special instructions for using it.

Refrain from pools, hot tubs, or the gym for 2-3 days after the piercing.,
Know that all new piercings become inflamed for several days.,
Remove the jewelry if you are worried about an infection.",How to Treat Infected Piercings1," Using warm water and soap, apply a washcloth to gently wash out your new piercing. Keeping dirt, grime, and bacteria away from the wound should be enough to prevent infection.


Be sure to clean the piercing after exercise, going outside, cooking, or cleaning.
Rubbing alcohol, though it kills bacteria, will dry out your skin and potentially cause an infection.;
, While you could buy saline at the piercing parlor, you can also make it at home with only 2 ingredients. Mix 1/8 tablespoon of non-iodized sea salt into a cup of distilled water and stir until it dissolves. Submerge your piercing in the saltwater, or soak a clean cotton swab in the water and apply it to the piercing for 20 minutes twice a day.

, Dirty hands are the number one cause of infection, so always wash your hands before touching or treating your piercing.

, If you have a piercing that is constantly rubbing on your clothes, wear looser clothing. This is especially true for navel, genital, nipple, or other body piercings.

, These places are hot-spots of moisture and bacteria that commonly lead to infections. Your piercing is an open wound and it will absorb bacteria much more readily then unbroken skin.

, Don’t freak out if you see redness or soreness in the first few days after a piercing. This is your body’s normal response to a puncture. Inflammation is common and can be easily treated with an ice-pack and ibuprofen. If the inflammation lasts for more than 3-5 days, however, you may be developing an infection.

, If you are draining pus or have serious pain or swelling, remove the piercing and clean the infected area off with soap and water. However, do not remove your piercing unless you have an infection, as this can make it impossible to return the jewelry without another piercing appointment.Clean your jewelry in hot, soapy water and return it if you only have light redness or swelling. This may prevent and infection from ever forming.

See your doctor if you suspect infection to prevent complications and tattoo discoloration.,
Use a topical ointment to disinfect the infected tattoo.,
Apply a clean bandage to keep germs out.,
Apply a cold pack.,
Let the wound breathe.,
Protect your tattoo when you go out.,
Avoid getting the infected tattoo wet.,
Don’t use any creams or lotions on the infected skin.,
Take medications to reduce pain and bring down swelling.",How to Treat an Infected Tattoo1," Tattoo infections are fairly common, and can become a medical hazard if left un-addressed.


Your doctor is your best resource for diagnosing infection and prescribing the appropriate measures to treat it.
As with most skin infections, the most effective treatment is usually antibiotics.
Additionally, your doctor may order blood tests, if he or she deems it necessary.
Treating your infection early will prevent medical complications, and will protect your tattoo from damage and discoloration.;
,

Use a topical ointment, such as Bacitracin, A&D Ointment or Neosporin if your tattoo is confirmed infected.

Only use a topical antibiotic if your tattoo is confirmed infected, because otherwise you will clog your skin's pores and potentially increase the likelihood of infection.
The ointment will also make your bandage less likely to stick and pull your skin.

, Ensure the cleanliness of your bandage by redressing your tattoo once a day.


Make sure to wash your hands before redressing your tattoo.
The bandage will help to protect your infected skin from abrasion and from germs.

, To minimize itching and swelling, apply a cold pack to your infected tattoo. Do not place ice or an ice pack directly on your skin. Instead, wrap the ice or ice pack in a thin towel so that the ice does not harm your skin or cause tissue damage.Hold the ice on your tattoo for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the ice and let your skin warm back up. Repeat as necessary.

, Expose your tattoo to open air as much as possible. Exposing your tattoo to fresh air, rather than keeping it bandaged up, will actually help it to heal more quickly. It will also help to keep the infection dry.

, While the infected tattoo needs fresh air to heal more quickly, you also need to ensure that the wound is guarded against dust or dirt particles. Use gauze to cover the wound whenever you go outside or do an activity that might get your tattoo dirty.


Change the gauze frequently to help your infection heal.

, Try your best to keep your tattoo from getting wet while the infection heals. As mentioned above, you should try to dry the tattoo out as much as possible.


When taking a bath or shower, cover the tattoo in plastic wrap and hold the edges of the plastic wrap down with tape. This will help to keep the tattoo from getting wet.
Avoid swimming as the chlorine content in the pool water could harm your skin.

, Avoid all chemical products including soaps and creams as they can be harsh on your skin and aggravate your infection.


You should still consider applying sunscreen if you go outside, but try to find a lightweight sunscreen that contains natural products, if you do choose to use sunscreen.

, Over-the-counter medications such as Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin can be taken to relieve the pain and swelling associated with an infected tattoo.


Do not take these medications on an empty stomach as they can cause you to have an upset stomach and can lead to liver problems.

Pain or soreness
Excessive redness
Swelling
Puss, blood, or fluid discharge

, Infections can progress rapidly if not cared for, and most infections can be wiped out quickly if they are properly cleaned early and often. Call your piercing parlor with any questions. When in doubt, always clean your piercing with warm water and soap.

, You can buy this simple antiseptic at most piercing parlors, but it is easy to make at home as well. Mix 1/8 tablespoon of non-iodized sea salt into a cup of water and stir until dissolved. Submerge your piercing in the water, or use a clean cotton swab to press it against your ear for 20 minutes twice a day.

, Use over-the-counter creams like polymyxin B sulfate (Polysporin) or bacitracin to fight off bacteria in your infection. Apply the ointment lightly to the wound with a Q-tip or cotton swab twice a day.


If a skin rash or itching develops, stop using the ointment. The rash may be caused by an allergic reaction.

, An ice pack will lower swelling around your piercing, which can help fight off infection. Never apply ice directly to the skin, as this can cause tissue damage. Put a layer of fabric or a cloth towel between the cold pack and the skin.

, They will have advice for you based on the piercing and symptoms. Oftentimes they will repeat the post-piercing cleaning process, which can help quickly eliminate an infection.


For simple infections, the piercer will likely give you treatment suggestions.
For serious infections, the piercer should send you to a doctor with detailed instructions about the wound, piercing, and potential solutions.

, Your doctor will most likely prescribe something to treat the infection, usually an oral antibiotic. If you see no improvement or your symptoms worsen after treating the infection at home, you should immediately see a doctor. Symptoms to watch out for include:

Monitor your temperature for fever.,
Look for red streaks spreading outwards from the tattoo.,
Feel for any swelling and inflammation.,
Look for a discharge of pus.,
Feel for swollen lymph nodes.",How to Treat an Infected Tattoo2," Infections can cause your skin to emit a bad smell. This is because the bad bacteria causing the infection, which are called anaerobic bacteria, begin killing your cells, which causes a bad smell to occur.

, It is normal to feel pain right after you get the tattoo, but it should start to fade gradually. Pain caused by an infection will persist and get worse as time goes on.


If you are experiencing a serious, sharp and shooting pain in the location of your tattoo, you should consider going to see a doctor.

, When your body senses that you have an infection, it will increase your internal temperature in an effort to burn and kill off the bacteria or virus causing the infection. This makes you have a fever.


Keep track of your fever. If it continues to go up, consider going to see a doctor.
You may also experience muscle weakness when you develop a fever. This is because your body is putting a lot of effort into raising your temperature to combat the infection.

, If the infection has persisted for quite a while, there is a chance that you might develop blood poisoning. If this occurs, red lines will start to form that shoot out from your tattoo and travel up your veins.


If this is left untreated, you could become very seriously ill. Go to the hospital right away if you notice these signs of blood poisoning.

, When an area of your body becomes infected, swelling and inflammation are generally some of the first symptoms that you will notice. If you tattoo is infected, it may look puffy or distorted in appearance.


You may also experience itching and irritation in the area.

, If your tattoo is infection, it may being releasing pus from the wound sites. This pus could be greenish or yellowish in colour. If you see this pus, it means that you have a pretty bad infection and should seriously consider going to the doctor.

, When you have an infection, your lymph nodes may swell up while your body tries to fight the infection. This is because your lymph nodes are part of your immune system, the system in your body responsible for fighting infections.

This will reduce the amount of time that your belly button is tender and easily irritated. Regular cleaning will also help prevent serious irritants such as infection.After washing your hands with soap and hot water, use a Q-tip or cotton ball dipped in saline solution or mild antibacterial soap to wash both holes made by the piercing, as well as your belly button.
Gently rotate your piercing about four times around after washing.
To make your own saline solution, mix a half a teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water.
Continue washing your piercing and the surrounding area once or twice daily until the redness, swelling, and discharge that normally follow a belly button piercing subside.;
, Once the belly button piercing has healed, it’s still important to wash it regularly. Showering is the recommended method of washing, as bathtubs can harbor bacteria that may infect your piercing.Do not use a washcloth or loofah to clean your belly button piercing. These can harbor bacteria and may pull or otherwise irritate your piercing.
Use a gentle soap to wash both holes of your piercing, as well as your belly button and the surrounding area.
Allow water from the shower to simply wash the soap away.

, One common irritant and potential source of infection for belly button piercings is bodily fluid. This includes your own or other people’s fluids. Avoid getting saliva, sweat, and any other bodily fluid on or around your belly button piercing.When you sweat, be sure to wash your belly button piercing at your earliest convenience.

, Do not get in a pool, hot tub, or natural body or water while your belly button piercing is healing or infected. Even a clean, well-maintained, and chemically-treated pool may still contain bacteria that can cause an infection or prolong healing., After receiving your piercing, the professional that gave it to you will direct you on how to properly clean the piercing and help it heal. Be sure to remember everything they tell you, and write their directions down if you may forget.


If you experience unpleasant symptoms or an infection associated with your piercing, call the business where you received the piercing and ask what they recommend for treatment.

, Your belly button piercing will be especially susceptible to irritation for the first few weeks you have it. During this critical healing period, avoid any activities that involve physical contact. More to the point, avoid any strenuous exercise that may disrupt the healing process.Do not play team sports, such as soccer or basketball, until your piercing is fully healed.
Avoid activities that involve extensive stretching for two weeks as well, such as climbing and yoga.

, Very small amounts of chafing or abrasion can irritate your belly button. Especially during healing periods after a new piercing or following an infection, wear loose-fitting clothing that will not constantly rub or apply pressure to your piercing., It’s important to prevent irritating your belly button while you sleep. While sleeping on your side is fine, sleeping on your back is best. Most importantly, avoid sleeping on your stomach., Fiddling with your belly button can cause it to become irritated, and may even contribute to an infection. In particular, avoid absent-minded touching or tugging on your belly button piercing.When you want to adjust your jewelry or touch the area for another reason, be sure to wash your hands before doing so.

, The area around a new piercing may be red, tender, and/or swollen for a few weeks. However, if these symptoms last more than three weeks, they may indicate an infection. Similarly, yellow discharge is normal for about a week after getting a belly button piercing. If discharge continues, turns green, or includes blood, this likely indicates an infection.Other indications of an infection include excess crust around one or both of the piercing’s holes, persistent pain or soreness to the touch, skin sensitivity, the ability to see the piercing through the skin, or any movement or loosening of the piercing itself.
If any of these symptoms are present, see you doctor.

, A saline press is another way to wash and disinfect your belly button piercing that will also reduce pain or other irritation from infection. Dissolve a quarter teaspoon of salt into a cup or so of water that is hot, but safe to touch. Use a cotton ball of piece of clean gauze to soak up the solution. Lie on your back and gently hold the saturated material onto your belly button area for 10 minutes.Repeat this process twice a day to help kill bacteria and reduce irritation.
Dry your belly button with a disposable paper product such as paper towel.

, While these actions may be tempting, they may actually prolong the healing process. In fact, removing your jewelry can lead to other health complications. Similarly, antibacterial ointment can inadvertently trap bacteria within the infected area., Tea tree oil, aloe vera, white vinegar, and chamomile tea are all said to have infection-fighting properties as well. While saline solution is the recommended method of disinfecting your piercings, these may offer supplementary relief from irritation and other symptoms of an infection.Aloe vera gel can help soothe an irritated belly button and may even help prevent scarring. Get aloe vera gel from your local pharmacy.

, Home treatment may not be adequate to rid your piercing of a persistent infection. If you have an infection that lasts longer than a week, set up an appointment to see your doctor.If your belly button gets especially swollen, is significantly painful, and/or continually bleeds or discharges fluid, see your doctor as soon as possible.

Pair journaling with other beneficial activities.",How to Manage Anxiety with Journaling," Physical sensations of anxiety such as sweating, a racing heart, and trembling are connected to your thoughts and these thoughts often start because of a trigger. Your triggers may be almost anything, such as a noise, a sensation, or a situation.To begin to identify your anxiety triggers, start paying attention to what happens before you start to feel anxious and write about these things in your journal.
For example, you might have heard a loud noise and worry that you are being robbed, or you might get a headache and worry that you have a brain tumor. No matter what the cause, take a moment to write it down.;
, When you have identified the trigger of your anxiety, you can start to think about why this is a trigger for you. Some questions you might respond to in writing to understand your trigger include:Why are you worried about this trigger?
What do you think is going to happen?
How strong is your belief that this will happen on a scale of 0 to 100%? (100% being the strongest)

, After you have considered the reasons behind what triggered your anxiety, you will need to think about how you feel. Pay attention to the physical and emotional symptoms of your anxiety and write down a brief description of each one.What emotions are you having along with your anxiety? Are you frightened, excited, sad, angry, etc.? How intense are these emotions on a scale from 0 to 100%?
What physical sensations are you having? Are you sweating, trembling, flushed, dizzy, in pain, etc.?

, Now that you have developed a good understanding of your anxiety trigger and how it is making you feel, you will need to find a way to challenge the thoughts that are driving the anxiety. Some good questions to respond to in writing include:What actual evidence is there to support or refute the thoughts you are having? For example, if you are having anxiety because you have a headache and you think it might be a brain tumor, then you might only have the pain as evidence to support the thought. Evidence to refute the thought might be that you have no other symptoms and that the pain goes away after you take an ibuprofen.
What would you do if the worst case scenario came true? For example, if you did have a brain tumor, you might have to have surgery and/or chemotherapy along with other treatments. You might also feel quite sad and afraid.
What else might explain the way you are feeling? For example, other explanations for your headache could be that you have been straining your eyes too much, that you are dehydrated, or that you are under a lot of stress.
What can you do about the situation right now? For example, you might decide that you can drink a glass of water and take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen.

, After you have gone through these questions to challenge your thoughts, try to identify the type or reaction that you would like to have to these triggers and thoughts in the future. What is the ideal reaction that you would like to have when you experience the same trigger again? Make sure that you write your ideal reaction in your journal.For example, the next time that you have a headache, you might like to calmly respond by drinking a glass of water and pain medicine. Then, if the headache does not go away, you might call your doctor for advice rather than trying to diagnose yourself.

, To close the exercise, take another look at your anxiety level. Consider the current strength of your physical sensations and emotions regarding your original anxious thought. Then, write about how your feelings have changed.


For example, how sure are you now that your headache means that you have a brain tumor? How do you feel physically and emotionally? Have your physical sensations and emotions become less intense? How would you rate their intensity now?, Journaling is easy to do, and need not take much time out of your day — even only fifteen minutes per day is often beneficial.However, as with taking on any new activity, establishing and maintaining the habit of writing down your feelings can be a challenge.


One recommendation is to start the process by dedicating 30 consecutive minutes each day to journaling, for at least three to four days. Ideally, choose the same time and place each day, and avoid distractions or stopping. Do your best to write continuously for the entire half hour — worry less about what you’re writing and more about establishing the habit of writing.Once you get used to the process of emotional journaling, you may be able to remove the dedicated time or place, or reduce the amount of time per day. You may be more comfortable carrying your journal with you and writing whenever the urge strikes you. However, if a set journaling time works best for you, stick with it. The number one rule of anxiety management through journaling is to do what works for you.

, Writing about a relaxing place may also help to calm you down when you feel anxious. The place that you choose to describe can be real or imaginary. Just make sure that you describe it in as much detail as possible. Use lots of sensory details like sight, sound, smell, and touch to bring your imaginary place to life.For example, you might describe your grandmother’s kitchen with sensory details by mentioning the yellow and white speckled linoleum floors, the sound of her humming mingled with the sounds of cooking, a soft, the feel of a cool breeze blowing in from the small window by the sink, and the smell of roasting meat in the oven.
Any time that you feel anxious, you can read the description or write more about your relaxing place.

, If you feel uncertain about your ability to put your experiences, thoughts, and feelings into words, focus first on ""filling in the blanks"" of an established script. With some of the ""heavy lifting"" already done for you, you can focus on expressing the basic details of your particular experiences.For instance, draw up (or find an example of) a text with blanks to fill in, which may remind you of doing ""Mad Libs"":

_____ was a time in my life that I remember feeling good. I would sum up the feeling in a few words as _____. I remember being _____ and noticing _____ . I also clearly recall _____ . I was ____ at that time, and I realize I'll never return precisely there again. But I can return to feeling that way.



, Some people simply aren't comfortable (or don't think they are comfortable) communicating their feelings, even when they are the only audience. Practicing with an established ""script"" that guides you through the process of expressing and defining your feelings can help ease you into a greater comfort level with emotional journaling.Consider using a set of simple analogies, for instance:

If feelings were animals, this one would be a _____.
If feelings were food, this one would be _____.
If feelings were TV shows, this one would be _____.
If feelings were crayons, this one would be the color _____.



, Especially if you are someone who is more comfortable with structured experiences, the notion of free-flow writing may be a challenge. If so, you can eschew a paragraph-style format for a column-entry style of journaling, in which you provide specific types of information in defined places.For instance, create three columns in your journal: 1) Situation; 2) Thoughts; and 3) How anxious do I feel? Then fill in the relevant information about particular episodes during your day that created anxiety, perhaps with a date and time attached for reference.
This method can be particularly useful for “on-the-spot” journaling, where you jot down your feelings immediately or soon after an experience occurs.

, Some people who resist the idea of emotional journaling will say things along the line of “But I don’t know what I am (or was) thinking” or “But I’m not thinking about anything when the anxiety comes on.” You don’t have to have all the answers to benefit from journaling, however. The process of journaling itself helps you to discover the answers you need.If you’re not sure what triggered an anxiety episode, or don’t know how to describe your thought process or how you were feeling, just jot down some possibilities that you can use as clues later. When you come back to your journal a few hours later, you may be able to process the experience more clearly, and use these clues to construct a more complete entry.
For instance, say that you experienced a big surge of anxiety before a project meeting at work, even though you were well-prepared. The meeting itself may not have been the cause, so jot down some other possibilities to consider in greater depth later. Did you have an awkward conversation with a romantic interest at lunch? Did you have a fight with a loved one that morning? Do you have your bowling league championship match coming up that evening?

, Some people will take to journaling quite readily, while others may need some more time and direct guidance in order to establish a beneficial routine. Emotional journaling can be a component of regular sessions with a mental health provider, or done on your own, but it never hurts to get some expert advice.Writing about personal anxieties can dredge up a surge of emotions in some people, so it is advisable to inform a mental health professional — or at least a person close to you whose judgement and compassion you trust — before embarking on the process. A professional can help you determine which types of journaling may be most beneficial for your particular anxieties., Keep in mind that journaling is not a “quick-fix” for anxiety. It is intended to be a way to help you recognize and learn to manage the feelings and factors that create your anxiety, which is not a process that is easily rushed. Just because you don’t feel immediately more relaxed the first time you try emotional journaling does not mean it can’t work for you.Journaling may provide long-term benefits to emotional, mental, and even physical health, but in the short-term it can have either positive or negative consequences. Some people feel worse initially when prompted to recall and rehash anxious moments, which is why it is wise to consult a mental health professional before embarking on a journaling regimen.

, However, the most important part of journaling for anxiety management is to keep on writing — in whatever manner works best for you. Some call it “feeling the wave” — let your thoughts and emotions flow out into words for as long as the “wave” continues to push.Don’t get caught up on grammar, spelling, or structure if doing so interferes in any way with your writing process. This isn't a school assignment, with grade deductions for poor writing.
The main goal is always to identify your thoughts and feelings through the process of writing them down, as the first step toward better managing and adjusting them. What you write down doesn’t need to look neat or sound pretty to be effective., Journaling helps you to identify the connections between your anxieties and experiences. Journaling can also serve as a “checkpoint between your emotions and the world,"" which may make it easier to see when your anxious thoughts do not reflect reality.For instance, if you always experience severe anxiety about failing school exams even though your grades are quite good, the act of writing these experiences down can help you recognize the disconnect between your emotional response and the reality of your situation.
In addition to helping to define distance (between your reality and your emotional responses), journaling can facilitate definition (of the causes of your anxiety and your reactions); release (of pent-up pressure and uncertainty); focus (on the central issues); clarity (through organization of your thoughts); regrouping (by clearing the slate and starting again with new awareness); and maintenance (of enlightenment and coping skills through continued writing).
Along with helping you identify triggers, symptoms, and responses, emotional journaling also makes it easier to prioritize your problems, fears, and emotions. Laying your sources of anxiety out in front of you lets you better see what is worth your concern and what is not., Emotional journaling is all about you. It is your process, done in the manner that works best for you, for your benefit. No one ever has to see what you've written for it to be beneficial to you.If you are journaling under the guidance of a therapist, he or she may recommend that you share the journal with him or her. This can be very helpful for some people, but don't feel as though you have no choice but to comply. If ""push comes to shove,"" you can always find a new therapist.

, Journaling can help you tap into the “stream of automatic thoughts” that runs like background music within all of us, sometimes undetectably. Recognizing the thoughts that are contributing to anxiety is the first step toward adjusting them. Combining journaling with other healthy, calming activities can boost the effectiveness of this process.Relaxation and meditation techniques are obvious ways to deal with anxiety, but doing things like eating well, exercising regularly, getting adequate sleep, and abstaining from drugs and excessive alcohol may seem as odd at first as journaling. However, a healthy body is more calm, focused, and self-aware, and therefore can help enhance the benefits of emotional journaling."

Considering what you need to make your video before you start will ensure that the creation of the video is as smooth as can be.


Pay attention to lighting. Proper lighting is important, so consider filming in a location with good natural lighting during the daytime, or consider bringing your own lights to your filming location so your educational video will have a bright feel.
Locate a decent microphone. A good microphone will help your message come through loud and clear on your educational video. Even a small microphone can improve the quality of your video immensely.
Consider the goals of your video. Are you making this video to be shown at a professional workshop or in a classroom? If so, you may want to invest in a higher-quality camcorder for more professional recording. However, if you are making this video for fun, you may be more comfortable filming on a piece of equipment you already have such as a tablet or smart phone.;
, An optimal location for filming will be a place where you feel comfortable and can set up the necessary equipment to film your educational video. Additionally, you will want a place where surrounding noise is at a minimum, as this will can interfere with your video.Visit the location before you start filming if possible. Pay attention to the noise level at different times of the day, and pick your desired backdrop to film your video.

, After you film your video, you will likely want to make some edits. A tool such as Windows Movie Maker (for a PC) or iMovie (for a Mac) can be very helpful for editing your finished educational video. This software will allow you to import and edit videos, add and edit audio, and share your movie online.Consider using additional technical aids to add in interesting features. Tools such as Go!Animate (which allows you to create cartoons), Google Story Builder (which allows you to create mini-movies and video stories), and Stupeflix (which will animate pictures and videos into a slide show) can make your homemade educational video look professional., Find a site where you want to upload your educational video for the world to see. YouTube is a great option in that it has the best tools for working with your videos and allows you to embed or share videos with ease.Many people choose to upload their educational videos to YouTube.


Watch other educational videos. Before you create your own video, it may be helpful to review some other videos to find out what to do and what not to do.

, A quick YouTube or Google search of your topic can help you determine what kind of videos already exist on the subject matter.


Do not be deterred by the existence of a similar video. Many people will watch multiple videos to learn something new.
Figure out how to make your video stand out from the rest. Identify anything that you may want to know that is not included in any other video, and make sure you include it in your own.

, Pick something that you know best, or learn about something new and tell the world what you have learned.


Determine what kind of educational video you want to make:

Will this be a “how-to” video, or will you be providing in-depth information on a particular topic?
Will there be interactive activities, or will you be talking throughout the video?


Make an outline of how you want your video to proceed before you start filming.

, Adequate preparation for your educational video is key. Many people (especially those who are camera-shy) are more comfortable speaking in front of a camera once they have rehearsed what they want to say.


Make sure you have your facts correct. Before making an educational video, double-check to make sure that the information you will be providing is correct. You don’t know how many people will watch this video!

, The key to creating an educational video in which you seem like an expert is to be confidence in your message. The best way to gain this confidence is through repetition.


Practice in front of a mirror. Doing a run-through of your script with no one around to judge it can be a good way to iron out kinks and gain confidence.
Practice with a friend, and have her give you feedback. It may be beneficial to have another person listen to your script before you film it and publish it.
If possible, practice speaking from memory without the assistance of notes.

, Think about the message you are trying to convey, and locate any props that will make this message clearer and your video more stimulating.


Watch other educational videos to see if and how they effectively use props. While it is important not to directly copy any other video, you may be inspired by what you see on other videos.
Remember that a prop can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. There are no specific guidelines to creating your own educational video! The props that you use in your video will be unique to the topic you are presenting.

, Remember that speaking in front of a camera can feel a lot different from speaking in front of your mirror. The more practice you can get, the better your video will be.


Film your dress rehearsal if possible. This will allow you to watch it over, review your performance, and identify any mistakes you may have made.
Ask a trusted friend to watch your video and provide critiques. A neutral third party may be able to better identify errors or potential distractions in your video.

, While you can make an educational video by yourself, it can help to have someone working the camera so you can focus on the content that you want to convey. In addition, your cameraman can give you instantaneous feedback and can pay attention to things such as lighting and sound.

, As you are making an educational video, you will want your audience to feel like you are an expert on the subject, even if you aren’t!


Dress appropriately for your video topic. If you are talking about preparing for an interview, you may want to dress like you would for an interview; however, if you are explaining how to fix an oil leak on a car, you will likely want to be in different clothing.

, Research has shown that the average attention span lasts anywhere from 7 – 15 minutes.Remember this when making your video, and try to make your video as concise as possible while still getting your message across.

, After you’ve shot the necessary footage, you should upload the video on your computer for editing.


Make sure you save your raw footage as a separate document so that you can edit it and make changes in the future.

, Publish your video to a site like YouTube where it will reach a broad audience. It may even go viral!


Check out wikiHow’s page on editing videos for YouTube as a great starting point.
Consider using the “YouTube for Creators” page on the YouTube site. This site will help you build your video production skills, understand your audience, and improve your YouTube channel., Your audience will be a great source of feedback for your video. Pay attention to how many “likes” and “dislikes” your video receives, and look for any constructive comments that may be posted.


Ignore negative or rude commentary. Don’t pay attention to any personal attacks or criticism that isn’t constructive!

, YouTube, for example, allows you to see who is watching your video, for how long they are watching your video, the ages and locations of people who are watching your video, and other helpful statistics.This can help you understand the demographics of the people you are reaching with your educational video.

Incorporate your students’ specific interests.,
Structure your students’ learning time to meet their needs.,
Provide your students with opportunities to teach each other.,
Get involved in your student’s or child’s learning.",How to Make Learning Fun1," When you appeal to your students’ interests, it is easier to engage them in the lesson and get them excited about the concepts.


As an educator, take time to ask your students about their hobbies and interests. If possible, find a way to incorporate these interests into your lesson plans. Also, allow your students to suggest topics and or bring in materials, such as books, games, or apps, that they enjoy and want to share with the class.
As a parent, find ways to merge your child’s interests with educational content. If they are interested in trucks, find books and educational games about trucks. If they are into music, use sheet music to explore fractions.;
, It is irresponsible to assume that all kids learn in the same way and at the same rate. As parents and educators, evaluate the specific needs of each child. Determine if they have trouble sitting still. Examine how they learn best—are they auditory learners, visual learners, or physical learners? Use this knowledge to structure your lesson plans and at-home lessons.


If they have trouble sitting still, give them plenty of breaks to move around.
If they are visual learners, incorporate lots of images into your lessons., When children are placed in charge of their own learning or the learning of others, they are encouraged to learn the material as thoroughly as possible.


As an educator, provide your students with opportunities to teach each other.

Assign each student a topic and ask them to prepare a lesson on their topic—it is now their responsibility to know that topic inside and out. Once they have prepared a lesson, have them present the material to a small group or in front of the class.
Have students work in pairs or small groups. Instead of asking you for help, encourage them to rely on each other to solve any problems they encounter.
Partner a student that is struggling with a student that has mastered a topic. Ideally, the student that is struggling will ask the other student questions.


As a parent, provide your child with the chance to teach you what they are learning. If your child is struggling to solve a problem, don’t give them the answer. Instead, ask them specific questions about the content, such as “How do you know ____?” or “How would you solve ____?”, When your students or kids are studying or taking part in an educational activity, join in. If you become an active participant in their education, you will model study habits, problem solving skills, and the feelings of joy one feels when learning something new. If they suspect that you do not enjoy the activity or the content, they will assume that the activity or content is simply not worth their time.


Spend one-on-one time with them. Most children like receiving individual attention because it makes them feel important. When you meet a child's desire for affirmation, they are more likely to be receptive to the lesson.
When the kids sit down for quiet reading time, take the opportunity to do some reading of your own."

Reflect on past entries.",How to Manage Bipolar Depression with Journaling," While some people enjoy journaling as a way to chronicle their daily lives, a journal for Bipolar disorder will probably look different. Instead of talking about each day, you may choose to discuss your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors as a way to help you. Journaling is linked to certain health benefits, and it can also help you problem solve and lower stress.If you’re ready to start a journal, make sure you’re ready to be introspective and reflective on your life and in your writing.Decide how you want to set up your journal and what purpose it will serve for you. Your journal format can change at any time so that it is most beneficial to you.;
, For journaling to be most effective, aim to journal every day or most days.Choose to journal in the morning when you first wake up, or at night before you go to bed. You may also wish to carry a journal with you throughout the day to write in.


You may choose to have a paper journal, computer journal, or online journal.
Keep your journal accessible. For instance, if you use a paper journal, keep a pen handy.

, Don’t rely on journaling to “fit into” your day. Instead, make time for journaling. Set aside 20 minutes each day specified for journaling.You may wish to have a special place to journal, or a certain ritual to go along with your journaling, such as enjoying a cup of tea or putting on calm, relaxing music.


Setting the scene and specifying time for journaling can help ensure that you continue your habit each day.

, In order for you to feel safe and able to fully express yourself, keep your journal private.If you keep your journal at home, you may consider putting it in a safe place or telling those you live with that your journal is private. If your journal is online, check your privacy setting to ensure it is locked to outsiders.


Sharing your journal may be beneficial at some time. Feel free to share your journal if you feel it will be helpful.

, Tracking sleep is an important part of managing Bipolar disorder, as changes in sleep patterns may indicate disruption and can contribute to relapse.You may want to describe your sleep (“Went to sleep at 9pm; woke up 2x during the night, then fell back asleep. Woke up feeling rested this morning”) or you may indicate your sleep with a number. If using a number system, decide what each number means. For instance, a one may mean “no rest at all” and a 10 may mean, “overslept and still tired.”

, Journal your emotions every day.You may want to check in each day by denoting a dominant emotion or mood, such “angry,” “sad,” or “confused.” You may also want to check in with your stress level (on a scale of one through 10). Over time, you can reflect on this information to clue you in on any patterns of your behavior.


For instance, you may notice that you tend to show more manic symptoms when you are stressed or very emotional, or your emotions are stronger at night.

, You may choose to track your moods as related to Bipolar disorder. When tracking moods, keep it simple and predictable so you can look back on the information easily. Describe your mood for the day, or if your moods changed, describe the changes. For instance, you may write “stable mood” for the morning, then, “depressed mood” at night. You may feel manic all day, depressed all day, or you may cycle throughout the day. Write this information down as your become aware of it.Throughout time, you may realize that your moods are affected by traveling or by the weather.

, Changes made to any part of your life can be beneficial to have in writing. If you go to your psychiatrist and you change medication, write it down. You can also write down any side effects you experience and how they change. You may also wish to write down any life changes that occur, such as moving, having a fight with your parents, change in jobs, etc., Use your journal to reflect on your current behavior and look back on previous behavior. Ask yourself if your habits have changed recently in a way that suggests mania, such as talking faster, taking on large projects, or running around cleaning. Also, note any changes that denote depression such as slowed speech or body movements, spending more time isolating, feeling apathetic or having no energy.If you are lacking awareness in monitoring your own behavior, ask a loved one or therapist to help you identify manic or depressive symptoms. The honest feedback may help you begin to identify these behaviors yourself., Ask yourself, “What’s occurring in my mind?” Assess whether your thoughts are linear or disjointed. Do your thoughts appear to make sense to other people? Do your thoughts make sense to you? Is it difficult to think or devote energy to thinking?


Your journal may disclose this information by default if you are manic. Notice any changes in handwriting or if your entries have changed at all.

, Identifying your emotions can help you gain control of your emotions even when they feel out of control. You may feel down or depressed. Take these feelings one step further: are these feelings based in guilt or shame? Increase your awareness of each emotion you feel, and this can help you intervene sooner.Where do you feel the emotion in your body? What thoughts or memories come to mind with the feeling?
Increase your awareness of this experience with emotion. Draw a picture that represents the emotion. What color is it or how many colors are present? Are the lines smooth, straight, jagged, or non-existent? How does it interact with other emotions?

, Write to your past self and say the things you wish someone would have told you then. Write to your future self with your hopes, dreams, and goals. What would you tell your past self to do more of, or to let go? What would you tell your future self to work toward?


You can also write a letter to someone in your life, either someone you care about, someone who has passed, or someone you have a grievance toward. What would you say to this person if given the chance?

, Depression can make you feel like you have no options and all outcomes appear dull. Examining situations from different perspectives may help you expand your viewpoint beyond yourself.If you feel stuck in life, helpless or hopeless, think about writing from someone else’s viewpoint, like that of your sibling, an acquaintance, or your therapist.


How would these people interact with your feelings if those feelings were their own? What would they say to you? How would someone who inspires you respond to the situation? What would he or she say in a pep talk to you?

, While you are encouraged to write your thoughts and feelings, be careful not to get “stuck” on negative feelings, regrets, guilt, or shame in your writing. Rumination is a symptom of depression, and can drag you further into feelings of depression.Rumination keeps you from problem-solving. If you find yourself ruminating, focus on solving the problem, or at least coming to terms with problems in a way that you can accept.After writing negative things down in your journal, change the focus into how to solve the problems and move past them.

, You may feel upset or angry or sad about a situation. Write out all of your emotions and pain and why you feel justified in feeling that way. If you’re mad at someone, write all the things you wish to say to that person, even the really mean things. At the end of the letter, acknowledge what happened, how it affected you, and more importantly, that you are willing to let it go and live without it.


When you’re done, you may signify your disengagement by ripping the page out of your journal and burning it.You can also keep it in your journal to reflect upon. You may return to the page to see how the situation or your feelings have changed with time.
You can also express gratitude for the situation in allowing you to learn and grow, despite it being uncomfortable.

, Periodically reflect on past journal entries in order to gain perspective and to gather inspiration.This process can help you track your ups and downs, and can remind you of coping strategies that worked well. It can also remind you of the difficult periods of life you were able to get through and how you did it.


Make a habit of rereading old journal entries.

Create hands-on-learning opportunities.,
Take your students on field trips.,
Allow students to utilize their imaginations.,
Play educational games.,
Make abstract concepts relevant.",How to Make Learning Fun2," Children retain information better when their hands and their brains are simultaneously busy, or engaged. This is accomplished by developing lessons and activities that require students to talk, listen, and move. These types of lessons and activities will benefit active, auditory, and visual learners.


Incorporate more arts and craft projects into your lessons.
Have students move around to different learning stations.
Group students by interests or strengths. Provide them with activities that let them explore a topic in a way that engages them., Field trips provide students with the opportunity to connect the abstract concepts they are learning inside the classroom to the real world.


As an educator, select field trips that promote hands-on learning. For example, if you are studying your nation’s government, take them to your state’s capitol building.
As a parent, you have the luxury to use your time and resources a little more creatively. Take your child to an art museum out of state to see their favorite painting or to a distant historic site to experience your nation’s history. Sign your child up for an engineering camp or have them shadow one of your friends at an office., Instead of limiting or checking their imagination, allow their creativity to run rampant. Foster their creativity by designing lessons that encourage the use of arts and crafts, role playing, or a range of similar activities.


When teaching students about the judicial branch, have your students hold a mock-trial.
When younger students study historical figures, ask them to dress up as their subject for a formal presentation.
Provide your children with the freedom to express themselves through a variety of forms. Older kids may enjoy writing poetry, telling stories, penning a play, or creating collages. Younger kids tend to enjoy drawing and coloring., After teaching a lesson to your students or studying a concept with your child, allow them to play an educational game that will test them on their new knowledge.


Find a relevant educational game through a quick internet search or download an app on your tablet.
Create a review game based on a popular game show or hold a trivia tournament.
Encourage your students or children to play board games or card games., Throughout their educational career, students are introduced to numerous abstract concepts that seem irrelevant to their lives. When you teach a new lesson, it is important to explain how the concepts are used by people on a day to day basis.


To explore mathematical and business principles, have the kids set up a store or lemonade stand. Encourage them to set prices, keep track of the inventory, and account for the money.Ask students to find recent news articles or tv clips that relate to what they are learning in school.
Have your students role play:

Conduct a mock trial.
Host a salon and ask each person to come as an important historical figure.

Allow kids to play electronic games and educational apps.",How to Make Learning Fun3," Today’s children are born into a digital age. They love technology and are very adept at using it. Capitalize on their desire to use technology by incorporating it into their assignments.


Instead of writing a journal, let them to document their experiences with a digital camera.
Allow students to use computers and tablets to conduct research.
Ask students to build websites, create videos, or develop a podcast.
Allow kids to listen to required readings., As educators and parents, you can make learning more fun by capitalizing on children’s love for all things digital.


In addition to lecturing, use digital presentation tools to present your lessons.
If you are a teacher, incorporate brief educational videos into your lectures. If you are a parent, use brief educational videos to explain concepts your child is struggling to grasp.
Instead of learning a world language, allow your kids to learn how to code., As a teacher and parent, consider supplementing lectures and traditional readings with educational videos, podcasts, and plays. Kids that may appear inattentive during a lecture, may be captivated by audio-visual materials.Show and listen to materials that are relevant to what the kids are learning.
As a reward for completing a great work of literature, take your class or child to see the theatrical adaptation.

, Educational apps and electronic games have acquired a prominent role in teaching our children basic skills and concepts. When used as a complement to traditional methods of learning, these educational tools can improve children’s classroom performance. Other benefits include:


Improving kids tech skills
Portability and availability
Exposure to alternative methods of learning

Practice smooth, clear speech.,
Stop using meaningless words and sounds.,
Use specific vocabulary.,
Contributes opinions as well as facts.,
Listen and ask questions.,
Don't try to bluff your way through a topic.,
Tailor your jokes to your audience.,
Use proper grammar when appropriate.",How to Sound Smart1," Enunciate each word so people can understand you easily. Practice talking at a steady conversational pace, making each sound distinct and clear.


Tongue twisters are a good way to practice enunciation. Try repeating ""See these thick trees, a tricky thicket indeed."" keeping each sound distinct.
Try eating peanut butter, then practice saying ordinary sentences. The increased stickiness in your mouth forces you to concentrate on your pronunciation.;
, Even presidents and public figures often sprinkle their speech with wells, ums, ers, likes, and you-knows, but you can do better. These words slow down the conversation and make you appear hesitant or uncertain. Practice thinking of the whole sentence before you open your mouth, then say it at an even, conversational pace without pausing or using these ""filler sounds.""


Keep a jar in your home, and drop a coin into it every time you use one of these words. Let other members of your household trade this money in for favors — for example, they can return $5 from the jar and make you cook dinner.

, There's no need to pick up five-dollar words that no one uses in everyday speech. Instead, think of vague words that you overuse, and come up with more specific, useful terms. Here are a few common examples:


Instead of ""good,"" ""cool,"" or ""awesome,"" describe the situation more accurately. Talk about a ""relaxing day,"" a ""thrilling vacation,"" or a ""friendly, hard-working person.""
Instead of ""crappy,"" ""awful,"" or ""terrible,"" consider whether you mean ""exhausted,"" ""depressing,"" or ""revolting.""
Don't just say ""I loved that movie!"" or ""I hate this weather."" Express an actual opinion, such as ""The jokes and action sequences were perfectly paced. They kept me laughing and excited the whole time.""

, Clearly, knowledge of a topic helps you converse in an intelligent way, but don't go overboard and memorize encyclopedia articles. When you learn a new fact, ask yourself these questions so you can build off of it, instead of just repeating it:


Why is this fact relevant? Should people change their behavior or opinions after hearing it? (For example, does new witness testimony in a court case affect the popular narrative about what happened?)
Is there solid evidence for this fact, and was it collected by an unbiased source? Is there a different conclusion you could reach from that evidence? (For instance, why is GMO food considered dangerous? Is there any evidence, and who collected it?)
Are there related, unanswered questions you think should be explored?

, Don't try to dominate the conversation or show off your intelligence. Demonstrate your curiosity and interest in other topics by letting other people speak, and asking specific questions that show you were listening and thinking about the topic.


Use specific, honest questions, not just ""Why?"" or ""How?"" For instance, say ""I don't know much about welding, but it sounds interesting. What's the last job you worked on?""

, Some people try to project confidence and invent facts and opinions on the spot, even if they've never heard of the topic before. This is a high-risk tactic, since listeners will often respond with irritation instead of admiration. Asking questions and learning from more knowledgeable people will let you contribute more to the conversation.


If someone asks you a question you don't know the answer to, say ""I don't know, but I can find out and get back to you.""
If no one in the conversation knows about the topic, you can try an educated guess, but be honest. For instance, say ""I haven't been following this topic in the news, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Senator's talk about political reform disappears after he's re-elected.""

, When talking to strangers, stick to lighthearted, inoffensive jokes, or avoid them entirely. When talking to friends, try to learn what type of humor they appreciate. Some people think puns are witty and entertaining, while others can't stand them.

, It's not always necessary to be a stickler for grammar, especially among people who use slang and non-standard dialects. You should still learn the rules of grammar so you can make a better impression in job interviews, public presentations, and other situations where traditional, ""proper"" language is expected.

, Many people with low self-esteem or fear of public speaking will undermine themselves by adding ""I don't know,"" ""I guess,"" ""I think,"" ""I'm not sure,"" or ""maybe"" to their sentences. Cut these out of your speech, and you and your audience will both have more confidence in what you're saying.

, Active sentences sound more confident than passive sentences, especially when you use the word ""I."" For example, instead of ""The email will be sent out tonight,"" say ""I will send the email tonight.""

, Smile while you listen or talk to someone, when appropriate. Use an occasional hand gesture, shrug, or head movement to show that you're paying attention.


Try not to fidget, shift from one foot to the other, or tap your fingers. If you can't shake the habit completely, switch to something less noticeable, like wiggling your toes inside your shoe.

, People often judge you based on outward appearance before you even start talking. Wear presentable clothing and pay attention to personal hygiene, especially when you're preparing for an important event.

Be aware of how important your role is as parent, guardian or carer.,
Be curious.,
Be engaged.,
Consider who can participate.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at Home1," In your household, the way in which you perceive education influences how your children see it. If you care about lifelong learning, your enthusiasm for it will be evident in all that you do and say. Your enthusiasm for learning sets the tone in the household and ensures that the tools for learning are always available. Your role is vital in encouraging and praising your children for the self-directed learning achievements that they make.;
, More than anything else, your role is about asking questions that prompt learning journeys. By asking questions, you invite your children to wonder and to ask the same questions in ways that allow them to set off and discover the answers that they don't yet have. Asking questions teaches children that there is no such thing as a stupid question and that it is through questions that we learn more about each other and our world. Any time that nobody in your household has the answer to a question, there is a perfect opportunity to have the children learn what they can about the matter and then tell you what the answer is.


Help your children to formulate questions themselves. Through your example of being a question-asker, they will learn to process the things they don't know as a challenge to find out and not be afraid to ask questions too.
Questions help to inspire the curiosity of your children and encourage them to engage in learning. Teach them not to be afraid of the unknown or a lack of knowledge.

, SOLE is an opportunity to participate in your child's learning. It doesn't replace schooling; instead, it teaches how to bring learning to life wherever a child is, and reinforces school learning. By being prepared to actively encourage learning in your home environment, you help your children to develop a lifelong love for learning and you also help your children to feel comfortable about sharing ideas and information with others. Most of all, it is about teaching children that learning is enjoyable, not a chore. And you'll be learning too, as you see your children discover things for themselves and bring the learning back to you.

, You might want to set up a SOLE activity for your own children. But you might also like to set one up for their friends or for neighbor's children as well. Consider asking other children if you have the space as this will help to ignite the love of learning beyond your home space too and can show all children that learning is fun.

, If your school is no longer in operation, contact the organization responsible for maintaining school accreditation in your area. This organization is usually the custodian of records for schools that close. For example, in Texas, you would contact the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools., If the private school you attended is no longer in operation, and you cannot contact the custodian of records for your school, contact your state’s Department of Education. Most states have a Private Schools Office that can handle your request.Provide as much information as you can, including the school name, address, county, and your years of attendance.

Contact the school board.,
Contact the private school.",How to Request High School Transcripts3," Some provinces, such as Saskatchewan and Alberta, allow online transcript requests for secondary school (high school) transcripts. Check your province’s Ministry of Education website to see whether your province has this option.You can usually pay via credit card for online transcript requests.
Currently, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Yukon provinces allow online requests.New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island require you to contact your school.

, In Canada, the individual provinces are responsible for public education. If you attended secondary school at a public school in Canada, you can contact the school to request your transcripts.Most provinces have a school information finder on their Ministry of Education website that can help you find the contact information for public schools in that province. For example, Ontario’s school finder is here.

, Sometimes, individual schools maintain their records in a central office, rather than keeping them at the school. You may be referred to the school board if this is the case for your school.The Ministry of Education websites for each province usually also have a school board finder to help you find contact information. For example, Ontario’s school board finder is here.
If you left school more than 5 years ago, you’ll need to contact the school board.
You’ll also need to contact the school board if you attended a public secondary school that is no longer in operation.

, Most private schools in Canada keep their transcript records on file at the school. If you attended a private school, contact your school to request a transcript.


If you attended a private school that is no longer in operation, you will need to contact your province’s Ministry of Education with as much information as possible to request your transcripts.

Get the basic equipment.,
Set aside SOLE time.,
Choose a comfortable learning environment.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at Home2," Here's what you need to get started:


A laptop or a desktop computer. Approximately one per four children is needed, although in the home environment, this will depend on the availability of computers and how the children like working together.
Paper and pens. This lets children take notes to share. Remember too that writing on paper has a mind and body connection that is different from typing, and many creative people insist that this connection sparks different ways of thinking, so encourage both.
Webcam, microphone, creative software for graphics manipulation/videos/music making, etc.

, Approximately half an hour to an hour will be needed for your first SOLE session. Choose a time that is relaxed, when school homework is out of the way and when your child or children are likely to be engaged.


You might like to treat this as special time spent together, as you might read quietly nearby or simply be present somewhere in the vicinity. Or, you can get on with the cleaning or cooking while your children are happily investigating the answers (the investigation stage is hands-off, although keeping an eye on progress is recommended).

, Switch off the TV and any other electronic distractions not related to the computers being used for research. Have the children sit or hang out somewhere that is comfortable and enjoyable in the home. This is a fun experience, so it's important for the children to feel comfortable.

"
"
Follow the approach of question, investigation and review.,
Determine a question.,
Provide a prompt to accompany the question.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at Home3," This simple approach gives plenty of room for discovery, research, creativity, analysis and conclusions.

, Make the question an exciting one that sparks the imagination and interest of the child or children. The best questions tend to be those that are large, open-ended, difficult and interesting:


Encourage children to consider theories rather than concrete answers. If the question seems unanswerable, children will be encouraged to posit many possibilities, pushing their thinking boundaries. Nothing is too fantastical or difficult for a child to tackle if you have faith in their ability to get on with discovery.
Broader, harder questions promote deeper and longer discussions.
Consider using a mix of familiar things and less well known things. For example, you may have pets, a garden or noisy neighbors. Questions you could ask about these include things like: ""Why did cats decide to live with humans?"", ""Can a garden be a source of health?"" or ""Why do some noises annoy us more than others?"" Then you can ask bigger picture questions, such as ""Can we use weeds to fuel our cars?"" or ""What was Ancient Greece really like?"".
For many ideas of good questions, check How to formulate questions for SOLE activities.

, There are many possibilities here, such as reading a brief information sheet, showing a video, playing music or audio, showing images, etc., all things related to the question. Basically, look for something that sparks curiosity and causes the child to want to dig deeper and look for the solutions.

"
"
Set aside approximately an hour.,
Explain what SOLE is all about.,
Ask the question (see above).

,
Set aside about 40 minutes for the investigation part of the SOLE activity.,
Review.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at Home4," You might need a little more or less time––that depends on the question, the context and the children involved.

, The first time you perform a SOLE investigation, you'll need to chat a little about the process and what it means. In your own way, make it clear that this is fun, not a chore.


If working with more than one child, delegate a ""helper"" child. This child is responsible for delegating within the group, such as resolving issues, problem-solving, etc. This, in itself, is an important learning process in helping others to get along. For one to two children, this role is not needed, although you may wish to provide question-driven guidance on occasion.

,, If you are working with only one child, have him or her set off online to find the answers to the question. If you have several children, have them work together.


Ask the children to keep records of their investigation. This can be notes, photos, quotes, audio recordings, drawings, diagrams, print-outs, etc.––basically, whatever they feel documents the investigation in the way that explains their findings.

, After the 40 minutes are up, ask the children to come back to you. Choose a comfortable place to sit down together and talk about the investigation. Your role is to facilitate the discussion. Ask more questions and listen actively:


Ask the participants what they felt about the experience.
Ask the participants what they felt they did well during the investigation, including noting what others did well. And ask them what they'd do differently the next time––it's as important to learn about what doesn't work as much as what does.

"
"
Continue using SOLE in your home as a part of your children's regular activities.,
Increase the complexity of the questions as your children grow older.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at Home5," You can implement SOLE beyond your home too, such as when you travel as a family, when you are out and about and when you are stuck in a traffic or a long queue. There are always opportunities to use SOLE, provided you can access the internet.


Use outings to promote SOLE learning at home. For example, if you and your family visit a museum, art gallery or similar place, or you go and see a movie or watch a sports match, you can use these as a basis for asking questions about things observed or not understood related to the event.

, SOLE is great for ages 8-12. During these years, your children's thinking abilities will change quite a lot, and you'll find that giving questions in greater complexity as your child grows older will help challenge them more.


You could also continue the SOLE activities for older children but this will likely depend on the level of schoolwork and other activities that they're engaged in. Hopefully by this stage, having used the SOLE process will set older children in good stead for deeper self-directed learning in their curriculum studies, as they will draw on the skills learned from your home-initiated SOLE activities.

Respond to your audience.",How to Tell a Story," Start your storytelling by interacting with your audience or doing something to grab their attention. Ask them a question, even if it's just rhetorical, that relates to the conclusion, twist, or context for the story you're going to tell. Alternatively you can make a grabbing statement that catches their attention (setting your hook, the equivalent of a click-bait headline). This forces their attention to focus on the idea of your story and makes them want to hear more.


Fairy tale example: ""Have you ever wondered why the moth chases the flame?""
Funny story example: ""I have the college roommate story to end all college roommate stories. Let's just say it involves a toilet."";
, Throughout your storytelling, you want to create an immersive experience. You want to tell your audience the story in a way that makes them feel like they're there. Start by giving them context when you start your story. Continue to create the scene by using details which help them picture the action and feel the things you felt. You'll also want to carefully tailor your language: use words which create very strong, very specific emotions.


Fairy tale example: ""Once upon a time, when the world was old and magic still lived and beasts still spoke...""
Funny story example: ""I'm sort of the quiet, owns-multiple-cats type, right? But my roommate was very much the what's-a-liver partier.""

, Of course, the entire arc of a story should be building tension and building tension, until the climactic point in the story and the falling action of the conclusion. But what you need to remember is that a release of tension should come between the tension points. Without this release of tension, a story can feel rushed or too list-like. Real life includes moments between the things that happen to us. Stories should too. This release can be a description of the scene, and quick filling in of semi-relevant details, or a joke if the story is meant to be a bit funny.


Fairytale example: ""Moth approached the tall, white pillar and there was Flame, burning in her glory. Moth felt hooked somewhere around his stomach and the tug of love set in. Of course, heroes do not rescue their princesses in the same day, and Moth spent many splendid moonlit nights falling deeper in love with Flame.""
Funny story example: ""It was a new year and so we moved into this new neighborhood that was nice and...stabby. So...I'm pretty much set to DEFCON 1 at all times. Good for the blood pressure, you know.""

, When telling a story, it is important to include details, to create that sense of immersion. However, you don't want the story to take on a ""rambling"" feel. This is why it's very important to focus on what's important. Cut the details that aren't important for the story, leave the ones that make the story.


As time allows, keep the details that go the furthest to create proper pacing or set the scene, but adjust as necessary to meet the reactions of your audience. If they start to seem bored, speed it up and pare down to the necessities.

, This is where knowing your story and practicing become important. You know that person that tells a story and they get partway in and then they're like, ""Oh, I forgot to mention...""? Yeah, don't be that guy. Don't stop to back up. This breaks the listener's experience of the story. Tell the story in a way that is logical and flows smoothly.


If you do forget a detail, weave it back in without breaking the experience of the story. For example: ""Now, the Pied Piper wasn't just after the town's money for no reason. You see, they'd gone back on a deal they'd made with him.""

, It's awkward when an audience isn't sure if you're done or not so make the conclusion of your story feel conclusive. There are a number of ways to do this, some examples of which are:


Ask a question and give an answer. ""How crazy is that? I know I'm sure not going to try that again.""
State the moral. ""This, ladies and gentlemen, is an excellent example of why you should never take your cat to work.""
Use tone and voice carefully. Try generally building in volume and speed until the climax of the story, at which point you should slow back down and lower your voice to show you are done.

, Make the different people in the story feel different. If you ""act"" them differently, then you can skip the annoying ""blank said"" parts of the story. You can also make the story feel more immersive. Play with accents, speech patterns, and voices for different people in the story. You can add great comedic value by being silly or stereotyping with the voices.


For example, characterize your father's voice with an overly deep, gruff sound and add in occasional extras to the dialogue like ""Also, I am going out to the garage to build a deck. Or part of a deck. Maybe I will just watch a television series where they build a deck.""

, Match the way your voice sounds to how you want the story to feel at that point. Change your pitch, tone, and volume to make stories seem calm or exciting, depending on where you are in the story. Accelerate your speed and slightly increase volume as you build toward the conclusion. Slow down when you say the conclusion.


You should also experiment with dramatic pauses. A moment of silence and a look can add a lot to someone's experience of a story.

, If you want to really become a great storyteller, you have to master your ability to create and change facial expressions to match what you're saying. Your face should be able to basically act out the entire story. If you really want to learn from the master, watch a lot of Youtube videos of John Stewart or Martin Freeman.


Remember, facial expressions come in more than 3 flavors. You can convey really complex emotions by using very specific facial expressions.

, Talking with your hands can make you go from seeming like a really stiff, boring story teller to someone who commands the room with a story. Hands convey emotions. Hands keep our audience focused. Hands create a feeling of action. If you don't use your body in any other way, at least start talking with your hands when you tell a story.


Of course, you do not want to go over the top. Do not hit anyone in the face or knock over your drink. Or knock your drink into your face.

, If you can, move your whole body to act out the story. You don't have to reenact every motion, but use your body at key points in the story to direct the listener's attention to that point. You can also use this to great comedic effect, of course.


Some stock gestures, such as the Groucho Marx eyebrow lift or the Rodney Dangerfield collar tug, can add extra silliness to a story (Conan O'Brien and Robin Williams frequently used stock gestures).

, Practice telling a story a few times before you tell it to other people. Then practice the story with a few people that don't matter much before telling it to anyone important. You want to be comfortable telling the story and get a good feel for when to add in dramatic pauses, and when to engage that big, building tone of excitement.

, Make sure you know the story backwards and forwards and then focus when you're telling it. This is to help keep you from missing details that are important. It also helps keep the story consistent across tellings, which is important if someone is likely to hear the story more than once.

, Don't turn your stories into ""fish stories"". You know the ones: where each time you tell it it gets more dramatic and more epic, and the details change to become more mythic and characters become less and less real. Listeners tune out when they hear you tell a story like this. Reel that fish back in and keep your story feeling authentic if you want people to enjoy it.

, You want to tell your story and a good place and time if you can. Even the best story can be ruined if you have to stop constantly because of distractions. Make sure the environment isn't too distracting or noisy. If someone tries to steal the focus of attention, direct it right back to you.

, A listener's experience of a story gets even better if they are able to interact and join in the experience. You can ask your audience questions or find other ways for them to interact with the story, if you really want to step up your storytelling.

, The most important skill to work on is being able to respond to your audience. If they start to get bored, wrap or step it up. If they're really enjoying a particular part, build on that. If they're laughing, give them room to laugh. It's tricky, but telling your story around the experience of your audience will make you a storyteller that no one will soon forget.

Understand the military clock.,
Learn how to write the hours from midnight until noon in military time.,
Learn how to write the hours from noon until midnight in military time.,
Learn how to say the hours in military time.,
Learn how to say hours and minutes in military time.,
Learn to convert from military time to regular time.,This is military time chart

",How to Tell Military Time," The military clock starts at midnight, known as 0000 hours. This is called ""Zero Hundred Hours."" Instead of having a twelve-hour clock that resets twice, in military time, you work with one clock that starts with 0000 at midnight and runs all the way until 2359 hours (11:59 p.m.) until it resets at 0000 hours at midnight again. Note that the military clock does not use the colon to separate the hours and minutes.


For example, while 1 a.m. is 0100 hours, 1 p.m. is 1300 hours.
Contrary to popular belief, the military does not also call midnight 2400 hours, or ""Twenty-Four Hundred Hours."";
, To know how to write the hours from midnight until noon in military time, you just have to add a zero before the hour and two zeros afterward. 1 a.m. is 0100 hours, 2 a.m is 0200 hours, 3 a.m. is 0300 hours, and so on. When you reach the two digit numbers, 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., just write 1000 hours for ten a.m. and 1100 hours for 11 a.m. Here are a few more examples:


4 a.m. is 0400 hours.
5 a.m. is 0500 hours.
6 a.m. is 0600 hours.
7 a.m. is 0700 hours.
8 a.m. is 0800 hours.

, Things get a bit more tricky as the hours ascend from noon until midnight. In military time, you don't start a new twelve-hour cycle after noon, but you continue to count beyond 1200 instead. Therefore, 1 p.m. becomes 1300 hours, 2 p.m. becomes 1400 hours, 3 p.m. becomes 1500 hours, and so on. This continues until midnight, when the clock resets. Here are a few more examples:


4 p.m. is 1600 hours.
5 p.m. is 1700 hours.
6 p.m. is 1800 hours.
10 p.m. is 2200 hours.
11 p.m. is 2300 hours.

, If you're dealing with whole hours without any minutes, saying them aloud is easy. If there's a zero as the first digit, then say the first two digits as ""Zero"" and whatever number is next, followed by ""Hundred Hours."" If there's a 1 or 2 as the first digit, then say the first two numbers as a pair of numbers with a tens and ones digit, followed by ""Hundred Hours."" Here's are some examples:


0100 hours is ""Zero One Hundred Hours.""
0200 hours is ""Zero Two Hundred Hours.""
0300 hours is ""Zero Three Hundred Hours.""
1100 hours is ""Eleven Hundred Hours.""
2300 hours is ""Twenty Three Hundred Hours.""

Note that in the military, ""Zero"" is always used to signify the zero digit in front of a number. ""Oh"" is used more casually.
Note that using ""hours"" is optional.



, Saying the time in military lingo is a bit trickier when you're dealing with hours and minutes, but you can quickly get the hang of it. When you tell military time, you have to state the four digit number as two pairs of numbers with a tens and ones digit. For example, 1545 becomes ""Fifteen Forty-Five Hours."" Here are some more rules for this process:


If there are one or more zeros in front of the number, say them. 0003 is ""Zero Zero Zero Three Hours"" and 0215 is ""Zero Two Fifteen Hours.""
If there are no zeros in the first two digits of the number, then just say the first two numbers as a set with a tens and ones digit, and do the same with the last two digits. 1234 becomes ""Twelve Thirty-Four Hours"" and 1444 becomes ""Fourteen Forty-Four Hours.""
If the last number ends in zero, just think of it as the ones unit paired with the tens digit to its left. Therefore, 0130 is ""Zero One Thirty.""

, Once you know how to write and say military time, you can become a pro at converting from military to regular time. If you see a number greater than 1200, that means you've reached the afternoon hours, so just subtract 1200 from that number to get the time using the 12-hour clock. For example, 1400 hours is 2 p.m. in standard time, because you get 200 when you subtract 1200 from 1400. 2000 hours is 8 p.m. because when you subtract 1200 from 2000, you get 800.


If you're looking at a time less than 1200, then you know you're working with numbers from midnight until noon. Simply use the first two digits to get the a.m. hour, and the last two digits to get the minutes to convert to military time.

For example, 0950 hours means 9 hours and 50 minutes, or 9:50 a.m. 1130 hours means 11 hours and 30 minutes, or 11:30 a.m.

Learn about the various types of shorthand, and consider the following factors: Level of difficulty, notable features, and aesthetics.,
Determine your preferred method of learning.,
Consider inventing your own form of shorthand.",How to Write Shorthand1," This will help you decide which system will be most beneficial for you. The following are the most well-known forms of shorthand today:



Pitman. First presented by Sir Isaac Pitman in 1837. Notable features: phonetic (records the sound of a letter or word rather than its spelling); utilizes thickness and length of strokes; symbols consist of dots, lines and dashes; system of abbreviations within Pitman shorthand.Level of difficulty: hard.


Gregg. Introduced by John Robert Gregg in 1888. Notable features: phonetic (records the sound of a letter or word rather than its spelling); vowels are written as hooks and circles on the consonants. Level of difficulty: moderate/hard.


Teeline. Developed in 1968 by James Hill as an easier alternative to traditional shorthand. Notable features: based on letters rather than on phonetics; of the symbol systems, most closely resembles the English alphabet. Level of difficulty: easy.


Keyscript Shorthand. Invented in 1996 by Janet Cheeseman, Keyscript is based on Pitman, but is fully alphabetical, using none of the Pitman symbols, but only the ordinary lowercase letters of the alphabet. It is phonetic. Level of difficulty: easy/moderate.
;
, If you learn best in a structured classroom setting, consider taking a formal course on shorthand. If you are a quick learner and prefer to learn independently, you may be able to teach yourself.

, If learning a traditional method of shorthand seems too daunting, or if you are feeling particularly creative, consider inventing your own form of abbreviated writing.

Be openly curious along with the students.,
Make the space for SOLE activities as part of the regular classwork.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at School1," In class, students can sometimes be worried that they might ask a ""stupid question"". This can stifle learning if children are worried that their peers and teacher are judging them unfairly for a dumb question. As a teacher, you can show that there is never such a thing as a stupid question, and you can help children to see that it is often the person who has the courage to ask a question who is able to get answered what everyone else was wondering!


Have a class discussion about the worth of asking questions. Ask them how they feel about asking questions, who they are most likely and least likely to ask questions around, and why. This will help them to explore what may be holding them back from asking questions in different situations of their life.






Lead discussions by asking questions and getting class participants to do the same with each other.
Invite your class to be a question zone, one where nobody's question is ever ridiculed.
Help class participants to formulate questions themselves. Some of the participants may have a difficult time with question asking as a skill, so it's useful to give them the tools to do this.;
, Once a week, choose a one hour period during which SOLE activities are pursued as part of the usual coursework. The activities can even be based around existing coursework obligations that if that assists you with finding the space for it.


The SOLE activity will require about an hour to complete, although the first session may take a little longer due to you needing to explain what SOLE activities are about.

See whether your local community college or university offers courses in shorthand.,
Find a tutor.,
Consider an online course.,
Set a schedule to keep your memory fresh.",How to Write Shorthand2," Classes will help you learn shorthand in a structured setting, and you will meet other students with whom you can practice and test your knowledge.

, If you prefer one-on-one training, a private tutor is a great option. Though it can be expensive, working with a tutor is one of the fastest ways to learn a skill because you will get immediate feedback on your mistakes.

, There are many shorthand courses available online, some of which are free of charge. Many of them include interactive elements like practice tests, chat rooms, and study rooms that will facilitate your learning experience. Search the internet to find a reputable website that suits your needs.

, This step is crucial, since learning shorthand depends so heavily on memorization. Whether you have decided to take an online course or use a private tutor, make sure you are practicing shorthand multiple times per week. If your class or tutoring session meet only once a week, devote time outside of class to practicing and studying.

, Go through the entire alphabet and learn the symbol for each letter or sound, depending on which type of shorthand you are studying.

, Since shorthand requires a lot of memorization, flashcards will serve as a great tool to help you remember which symbol represents which letter, word, or sound.

, These were designed by professionals to help you learn quickly and thoroughly.

, Until you have completely memorized the shorthand alphabet, practicing writing it will help you build intuition and understand the language more deeply than simply using flashcards alone.

, Just as with any other language, reading and understanding shorthand will improve your ability to write it.

, Using the flashcards you have made, ask a friend to test you on your knowledge.

"
"
Abbreviate words, especially if they are very long.,
Eliminate pronouns.,
Substitute numbers for words.,
Use initials in the place of a person's entire name.

,
Use your imagination!",How to Write Shorthand4," Make sure that when you go back and read your notes, however, you will know what word you were abbreviating.

, For note-taking, pronouns are often unnecessary if the subject is already known. For example, ""She likes cooking"" becomes ""Likes cooking.""

, This is a simple way to save you time. For example, the number 2 can be used in the place of the words ""to, too, and two.""

,, If you want your language to be difficult to decode, you will have to get creative. Come up with substitutions that don't make sense, or that aren't already commonly used. Consider using symbols to write your own unique alphabet, and then memorize it and keep a copy on hand.

Come up with unit tests as you write code, if you need to.,
Write testable code.",How to Write Unit Tests," The key aspect of a good unit test is that it checks just one portion of a program. Whether you are looking to test an existing program, or planning tests for a program that isn’t written yet, you’ll need to break it down into discrete parts (“units”). You’ll then write a unit test for each one.The definition of a “unit” varies widely depending on the type of program you are developing. A unit could be a class, but also a single function or procedure.;
, A unit test can be used to check two kinds of scenarios. State-based testing is used to see if a program unit produces proper or expected results. Interaction-based testing, on the other hand, is used to see if a unit sets anticipated methods into action. To write a good test, you’ll need to identify what you are trying to test for, so keep one of these approaches in mind as a model., Keep in mind that you’ll need to write lots and lots of unit tests. You’ll want to run a unit test for every portion of your program. Keeping your tests simple will have several benefits:Simple tests will help ensure that you really are testing only one unit at a time.
The tests’ code will be reliable. If you have complex test code, it will be more prone to problems, making it just that harder to see bugs in the code of the program you are testing.
The tests will be faster, decreasing the overall amount of time it takes to do the testing.
A simple test will be readable, meaning you may see some potential problems just by looking at the code itself.

, Seasoned developers know that there are different ways to test a program. Unit tests are narrow, specific, and look at only one portion of a program. Integration tests, on the other hand, look at the whole program in a real environment. In other words, unit testing ensures that the individual parts of a program work, while integration testing verifies that the parts work together.Integration tests also usually require external elements, such as web servers or a database. To keep unit tests controlled, write them so that they don’t require external elements.

, To actually run a unit test, you’ll need some input, but this can vary widely depending on the type of program you are developing. Common examples include a few variables or a list of data (such as a number set).You can try running your unit test with really simple data, or ""dummy data."" This can help you quickly assess if the unit works well.

, Set this to happen using the initialization code protocol for the programming language you are using. This step is known as the “Arrange” portion of the AAA approach. The part of the program you are testing is known as the System Under Test (SUT).For example, you might initialize a unit that performs some arithmetic on a set of numbers.

, The next portion of your unit test should ask the unit to “Act.” What you ask the test to do will depend on the language and type of program, but generally the test will do something like invoke a method for the SUT. For example, the requested action might be to give the sum of a set of numbers.

, You’ll need the unit test to include an aspect that will “Assert” whether or not the program you are testing is running properly. With the expected result in mind, write your unit test so that it will “pass” if things go as anticipated, and “fail” if they don’t.For example, if you want a unit to give the sum of only the even numbers from a set, you will expect the sum to also be an even number. If the unit gives an odd number as a result, then it has failed the test.

, Once the test has run its course, is your turn to interpret what happened. Did it pass or fail? Spotting a failure indicates that there is a problem in your program’s code that needs to be fixed. Since you’re just working with a single unit at a time, however, if will be easier to isolate where the problem might be.If your hypothetical SUT from the previous example provided an odd sum instead of an even one, for instance, you can check the code that produced the sum, as well as the code that retrieved the even numbers from the set, in order to see where the error is.

, Expert developers suggest trying this with your unit tests. From a strictly scientific point of view, having a program do exactly what you expected doesn’t prove that it actually will work. Trying bad data will show that the program will recognize problems and respond accordingly.Continuing with the previous example: if your SUT produces even sums, that doesn’t necessarily prove that it’s working correctly--it might just be giving false sums. Try the unit test with some bad data, like a set of only odd integers. The program should indicate that it could not produce the sum of all even numbers in the set because there were none in the set.
If you put in bad data and the test makes it seem like nothing is wrong (for example, it still provides a sum), then you know that there’s a problem with the unit (for example, perhaps the code is retrieving odd numbers instead of even ones).

, It might seem counterintuitive, but developers swear that the way to go is to write code to pass a unit test, rather than using unit tests to see if code will work. This can be the approach to take if you haven’t actually begun to write your code, or if you don’t have much yet. Be goal-oriented: write your unit tests to check if code will do what is expected, then write the code, then test it.Writing the tests first encourages you to write just enough code to make the program do what it needs to, without inadvertently including unnecessary or bad code.

, If you’re well on your way with the writing of your program, you can still make use of unit tests. Just draw on the map you made of your program to break it down into individual units. Run the tests using the AAA approach, and adjust your code as needed based on the test results., One of the hardest things about using the unit test approach in program development is that you must plan carefully to have code that can actually be tested. If your program is full of elements that you can’t actually test, then you won’t be able to use the unit test method to verify that your program will work as expected. Keep this in mind as you write code for your program.For example, avoid things like hidden inputs and non-deterministic factors in your program’s code.

Have the students come up with a topic sentence.,
Have the students expand on the topic sentence.,
Ask for an example.,
Ask for analysis next.,
Have the students close with a summary.",How to Teach Students to Write Main Body Paragraphs Using the T.E.X.A.S. Formula," The ‘T’ section promotes the use of the term ‘topic sentence’ which is something which many educators are asking students to identify and apply to their own writing practices. When teaching students, provide students with models where they are able to highlight key words and cohesive devices which are salient features of a topic sentence. Therefore, it is imperative that the argument, task or essay question has been unpacked to an extent that the key words have been highlighted. Students should be able to pick out a topic sentence in a card sort activity and justify their conviction that it is the topic sentence before they go on to create their own topic sentences. Students should also make the connection that it has a strong connection to the ‘S’ section. Those of you who are familiar with the ‘hamburger’ paragraph will recall the bun analogy. To extend students in their writing and allow them to take more independent ownership of their writing, encourage students to produce a list of synonyms for the key words which they can interchange to avoid repetition.;
, The ‘E’ section is for expansion as students are expanding on their assertion in the topic sentence rather than explaining and justifying themselves.

, The ‘X’ section is the example section and it is important that students briefly contextualise an example, building up to it, before inserting the detail. There may be more than one example to include. In a literary essay, this may mean more than one quotation. Students should be aware that choosing the most appropriate example is in itself a skill as a poor example will lead to poor analysis.

, The 'A' analysis section gives the student the opportunity to extend and refine knowledge, using higher order skills of inference, comparison and abstraction. Use M.E.S. to break this down for students. First explain what your example means (deductive reasoning), then explain its effect (inference) and its significance (making connections to the reader, to the context, to society, etc).

, The ‘S’ section has different functions depending on the level of complex reasoning required. It can mean simply summarising your conclusion. For those seeking a deeper understanding, it can also mean significance and students are required to apply their knowledge meaningfully to offer unique insights into their subject matter. Alternatively, those people who use P.E.E.L. will know that the L is the linking sentence, similarly the ‘S’ can stand for setting up for the next paragraph.

Ensure that the class has the basic equipment.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at School2," It's quite likely that you already have the basics but just in case, here's what you need to get started:


A laptop or a desktop computer. The class will need access to approximately one per four children for this to work well.






A whiteboard or blackboard where you can write down the questions being asked.
Paper and pens. This lets children take notes to share. Remember too that writing on paper has a mind and body connection that is different from typing, and many creative people insist that this connection sparks different ways of thinking, so encourage both.
Webcam, microphone, creative software for graphics manipulation/videos/music making, etc.
Name tags. This is optional but it might be necessary if the children are younger or don't know each other that well yet. And it can be a good way to make it clear who is the helper.

"
"
Follow the approach of question, investigation and review.,
Determine a question.,
Provide a prompt to accompany the question.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at School3," This simple approach gives plenty of room for discovery, research, creativity, analysis and conclusions.

, Make the question an exciting one that sparks the imagination and interest of the class participants. The best questions tend to be those that are large, open-ended, difficult and interesting:


Encourage class participants to consider theories rather than concrete answers. If the question seems unanswerable, children will be encouraged to posit many possibilities, pushing their thinking boundaries.






Broader, harder questions promote deeper and longer discussions.
Consider using a mix of familiar things and less well known things. For example, you might ask questions related to coursework already covered along with questions about things the class participants are yet to learn about.
For many ideas of good questions, check both How to formulate questions for SOLE activities and the SOLE guide at http://www.ted.com/pages/sole_toolkit.

, There are many possibilities here, such as reading a brief information sheet, showing a video, playing music or audio, showing images, etc., all things related to the question. Basically, look for things that spark curiosity and cause the class participants to want to dig deeper and look for the solutions.

"
"
Set aside approximately an hour.,
Explain what SOLE is all about.,
Divide the class into groups.,
Ask the question (see above).

,
Set aside about 40 minutes for the investigation part of the SOLE activity.,
Review.,
Summarize.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at School4," You might need a little more or less time, that depends on the question, the context and the children involved.

, The first time you perform a SOLE investigation, you'll need to talk about the process and what it means. Explain how it differs from a typical lesson and what sort of learning will be occurring. Focus strongly on how this is an exercise is self organization, making it clear that you'll be standing back and simply awaiting the outcomes.

, When forming groups, bear in mind that about 4 person per computer is optimal for the best learning results.


For each group, delegate a ""peer helper"". The peer helper is responsible for delegating within the group, such as resolving issues, problem-solving, etc. This, in itself, is an important learning process in helping peers to get along and learning to lead.







,,


Ask the class groups to keep records of their investigation. This can be notes, photos, quotes, audio recordings, drawings, diagrams, print-outs, etc.––basically, whatever they feel documents the investigation in the way that explains their findings. These notes will help them to give their presentation at the next stage.






When the children are exploring the questions, leave them to it. The peer helper should help to steer the group and resolve issues. Only step in if it's really necessary during the investigation phase.

, After the 40 minutes are up, ask the class groups to come back together as a whole class. Sit down together. Ask them to present their findings and talk about how the investigation went. As a teacher, facilitate their discussion by asking about the investigation, listening and encouraging other groups to make observations. Your role is as a moderator––do not add value to their presentation. For example, if you feel that the children are not answering on point, simply ask them to think carefully about whether they're answering the question when giving their presentation.


Ask what conclusions/answers/ideas the children have reached, on a group-by-group basis. When doing this, encourage each participant to talk, not just the one most willing to summarize the issues. Even within the group, there will be differences of perspective.







, After the children have had a good chance to give their presentations and explore their responses, then you can summarize what the groups have said. This is the time when you can add value.


Ask the participants what they felt about the experience. Ask for comparisons with the children's own lives/experiences and knowledge, etc.






Ask the participants what they felt they did well during the investigation, including noting what others did well. And ask them what they'd do differently the next time––it's as important to learn about what doesn't work as much as what does.
Ask the groups what they feel about the answers and ideas of other groups.

"
"
Respond in a way that gets the participants to find solutions to the problem as much as possible.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at School5," Try not to intervene but give the children the responsibility for resolving the problems. Typical issues that might arise during a SOLE activity in the classroom include:



One member of the group complains that another member isn't doing anything to help: Ask the helper to facilitate getting both children re-engaged. The ability to not run to an adult is part of the learning process.







One member of the group appears disinterested and unwilling to participate: Ask the helper to facilitate re-engaging and have the children understand that they can make changes as the investigation goes along. If you're ever investigating with several groups, children can also change groups, but this is usually only a useful solution for school or classroom situations.

There are squabbles over the computer availability: Help them to discuss ways of sharing the computer––let them find their own solutions by asking them questions about how to resolve it.

The helper isn't behaving: Suggest ways that can help the helper to manage the group. If you need to discuss difficult behavior, do so away from other participants and always praise the good things that the helper did.

The answer isn't correct. This is a good opportunity to explore what sources the children used and why they came to the conclusion that they did; it's a fantastic opportunity to teach critical thinking skills about why the children didn't discard information that isn't actually credible or reliable.

Consider your audience.,
Choose your topic.,
Ask questions.,
Research your topic.,
Make it understandable.,
Use interesting headlines.,
Proofread.",How to Write a Good Newsletter," Before deciding on what content you need for your newsletter printing, take a moment to define your audience; gather demographics, and decide what topics will interest them. For instance, an audience of mostly middle-aged women probably won't be interested in a detailed article explaining a product. Instead, choose a topic that will connect with them--specifically on a personal view.

, Include a variety of topics and sections that will make your newsletter more interesting to a variety of audience. Just as a newspaper contains different sections, your newsletter should incorporate similar sections such as a response section, letters to the editor, industry news, and featured articles. Include tips or customer reviews within boxes to break up the layout .

, Keep all information accurate. Use the six questions to give your newsletter a versatility: who, what, when, where, why and how. The best articles incorporate all six of these questions and answers, if applicable. This may require some research such as interviewing, but it is worth it if you want to make an effective newsletter with your audience's opinions expressed.

, Writing subjectively can severely harm your credibility. Without proper research, you risk presenting incorrect or inaccurate information, which may offend or confuse your audience. Provide information such as statistics, expert opinions, and quotes to prove the validity of your research. Make sure to give the source (e.g., magazine, website, book) credit where credit is due. If you are writing a newsletter on behalf of a company or organization, you should attend important meetings to stay informed about news or updates that are relevant to your audience. For example, customers might be interested in a new product feature, while donors to a non-profit organization probably want to know how successful your latest campaign was .

, Use concise and comprehensible vocabulary to ensure readability. Avoid verbose language. For instance, rather than using an adverb/verb combo, use a verb that denotes the same meaning.

, Write dynamic headlines by using action verbs that evoke curiosity. Without an interesting headline, readers may skim over your articles, because they find it uninteresting. Headlines are one of the keys to creating loyal readers, since a well-written headline means a well-read article means a well-read newsletter. Also, if any of your articles are more than a few paragraphs long, use subheadings to break up the text.

, After writing your articles, proofread for typos and then edit all articles for consistency of tone and voice. Never leave proofreading to your spell and grammar check tools. They are great for preliminary editing but poor substitutes for manual editing. Have someone else look over your newsletter for typos, since you can easily skip over them after staring at the text too long. And don't forget that you can't edit enough. Once you've thought you edited enough, go over it one more time. Even just a few typos will annoy readers enough for them to disregard you as a professional.

Continue using SOLE in your classroom as a regular activity.,
Encourage your students to take up SOLE activities at home.",How to Set Up a Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) at School6," Even excursions as a class can form part of a SOLE investigation, such as museum or gallery visits.

, Help them to explore learning beyond the classroom and as part of their everyday lives.


You could even consider holding a SOLE information session for parents one evening. Show them how the SOLE works and give them some ideas for running SOLE activities in the home environment.






Encourage after-school programs within your school environment to follow SOLE activities as one of the options for children to pursue after class.

Avoid using anecdotes instead of evidence.",How to Write a Debate Outline," Each form has its own organizational structure. You will base your debate outline on that structure. There are two common forms used in schools and competitions. Other forms are simply varieties of these two, changing the amount of time available and the organization of different segments.


Team debates are one of the most common debate forms. In the first half of the debate, each team has two segments to present arguments for their side. In the second half of the debate, each team has two segments to rebut arguments presented in the first half.
Lincoln-Douglas debates are set up to allow one side to present their arguments, and then the other team to cross-examine them. The second team then presents their arguments and has the first team cross-examine them. Finally, each team has an opportunity for a final rebuttal.;
, Whatever form your debate takes, you will have the opportunity to present your side of the issue. Gather all of your research and look for common arguments. On a piece of paper, list different pieces of evidence under each line of argument. This can include quotes, examples, cases, facts, and statistics. Be sure to note all bibliographical information on your notes.


Use the best research at your disposal, not just the first entries on google, in order to find solid evidence. Visit the library and look for peer-reviewed journals for a good selection of research.
For every supporting piece of evidence you find for your case, try to find another piece of evidence to counter it. This will help you build your argument later.
It is better to include more points than you think you will need, than not doing enough research and lacking evidence.

, While the order of your material will be determined by your debate form, the format for your debate outline should follow the basic guidelines for outlining. If you are doing your debate for a class, you were likely presented with a rubric which you should be making sure you are following.


Subdivide information. Main headings will probably consist of arguments, while subheadings will contain different pieces of supporting evidence.
Use correct symbols. Each level of the outline has a particular symbol to use. The main headings will use Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV). Subheadings use capital letters (A, B, C). Sub-sub headings use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). Keep these consistent throughout your outline.
Indent each level. Indentation helps you follow the line of argument and keeps your outline organized.

, Your case is your primary argument: the value you are trying to uphold through a variety of evidence. Start the outline of your debate by compiling a list of evidence that supports your case. Order it so that the most influential and powerful evidence is the first to be presented, mediocre evidence is in the middle, and a final powerful piece is at the end.If you have a fairly lengthy debate planned, break up your case evidence into categorical sections. For example, you could have legal, moral, and economic support for your case.
Aim to have a minimum of three supporting facts or pieces of evidence in your case outline.
In debates in particular, quality is better than quantity.

, You will have the opportunity to rebut or question the arguments presented by the other side. Identify potential arguments they may bring up. Many opposing arguments will probably be addressed in your research. Brainstorm different ways to counter these arguments during your rebuttal should the opposing side bring it up.Look to find rebuttals for both the individual parts of their argument in addition to the whole of it. This will fortify your position in the debate.
Many times their argument will be the opposite of yours, so while your argument lists the pros, theirs is listing the cons of a particular value. If you pay attention to this, you will be able to not only prove their side of the argument invalid, but also help to further promote your own.

, When you have made a bare bones outline of your case and rebuttals, begin adding a bit more detail that will benefit either essay writing or debating on the subject. Keep the outline form of headers, sections, and bulleted lists, but write in complete sentences, add in helpful questions and evidence, and make your argument more well rounded than just a list of a few words.


Write this more detailed outline as if you were speaking in the debate. This will help you with wording and understand your own argument, and coming up with logical questions and rebuttals for your opponent.
Be sure to avoid logical fallacies in your case outline and rebuttal/response. A sound argument will be based on solid evidence that you can back up with if necessary., Often used by beginning debaters in their outlines, the straw man fallacy is when you misrepresent your opponents case by describing it wrongly to the audience. Make sure you don’t do this in your rebuttal, and if your opponent does it to you be sure to call them out on it.


For example, if you’re promoting the abolition of the death penalty, your opponent might commit the straw man by accusing you of lacking sympathy for the families of victims, and that you don’t want true criminals to pay for their crimes.

, When making your outline for your case and rebuttals, it may be easy to refer to using the slippery slope fallacy. This happens when you assume something more extreme will happen on the basis that something less extreme is about to occur.


For example, if you’re arguing for legalizing gay marriage and your opponent says that it is a bad idea, because soon enough we will be legalizing polygamy and bestial relationships in all the states.

, Often used by the losing part of a debate, the ad hominem fallacy is when instead of attacking the merit of a case being presented, the opponent makes personal attacks against the person presenting the case.


For example, if you’ve presented a well worded argument for your case but your opponent has not, at their time for rebuttal they may instead make light of your poor grades or drinking problem. This is unrelated, may or may not be true, and has no effect on the debate.

, When loaded questions are used in debate, they seemingly point to an obvious fault in the argument, when instead they have caught the debater off-guard. Loaded questions are those which have a presumptuous base, so that the person answering the question is forced to defend themselves even if it’s not true.


In a debate about legalizing marijuana, your opponent accuses you of taking drugs by asking, “is it not true that you’re interested in legalizing marijuana because you yourself have done drugs in the past?”

, When someone doesn’t quite know what to say or is trying to avoid saying something that would appear detrimental to their case, they often use ambiguous language. This is where you give unclear explanations and are incredibly vague in your descriptions of things and events.


For example, if you ask your opponent why exactly why we should convert to a socialist system and they say something about how more people will benefit from it, but they aren’t able to supply clear evidence other than emotional reasoning.

, This is one of the most commonly committed fallacies, in which you assume something is correct or good simply because it is of popular belief.


For example, you state in your argument that because most people promote the death penalty, that it is the most effective means of punishment.

, Often used at the end of a debate to highlight the goodness of making a decision in your favor, the false dilemma fallacy occurs when you offer only two final options (black or white) when there may indeed be several other options available.


For example, your opponent states that as a result, the only two options are to legalize all drugs or to outlaw them.

, When presenting to an audience, often it is easier to rely on personal experiences and stories as the basis for an argument rather than finding clear evidence that supports a belief.


For example, your opponent argues that because their friend decided to have their baby instead of having an abortion and ended up happier, all women will feel the same way in a similar position."

Proofread as the last step of the process.",How to Write a Composition," It's important to get a clear understanding of what your teacher expects from your composition. Each teacher will have a different set of things they'll be looking for, both for the topic and the style. Keep your assignment sheet with you at all times while you're working on your composition and read it closely. Ask your teacher about anything you feel unsure about. Make sure you have a good sense of the following:


What is the purpose of the composition?
What is the topic of the composition?
What are the length requirements?
What is the appropriate tone or voice for the composition?
Is research required?;
, When you're first getting started in trying to figure out the best way to approach a topic you've got to write about, do some free-writing. No one has to see it, so feel free to explore your thoughts and opinions about a given topic and see where it leads.


Try a timed writing by keeping your pen moving for 10 minutes without stopping. Don't shy away from including your opinions about a particular topic, even if your teacher has warned you from including personal opinions in your paper. This isn't the final draft!

, A web diagram is good to create if you've generated lots of ideas in a free write, but are having trouble knowing where to get started. This will help you go from general to specific, an important part of any composition. Start with a blank piece of paper, or use a chalkboard to draw the outline diagram. Leave lots of room.


Write the topic in the center of the paper and draw a circle around it. Say your topic is ""Romeo & Juliet"" or ""The Civil War"". Write the phrase on your paper and circle it.
Around the center circle, write your main ideas or interests about the topic. You might be interested in ""Juliet's death,"" ""Mercutio's anger,"" or ""family strife."" Write as many main ideas as you're interested in.
Around each main idea, write more specific points or observations about each more specific topic. Start looking for connections. Are you repeating language or ideas?Connect the bubbles with lines where you see related connections. A good composition is organized by main ideas, not organized chronologically or by plot. Use these connections to form your main ideas.

, Once you've got your main concepts, ideas, and arguments about the topic starting to form, you might consider organizing everything into a formal outline to help you get started writing an actual draft of the paper. Use complete sentences to start getting your main points together for your actual composition., Your thesis statement will guide your entire composition, and is maybe the single most important part of writing a good composition. A thesis statement is generally one debatable point that you're trying to prove in the essay.


Your thesis statement needs to be debatable. ""Romeo & Juliet is an interesting play written by Shakespeare in the 1500s"" isn't a thesis statement, because that's not a debatable issue. We don't need you to prove that to us. ""Romeo & Juliet features Shakespeare's most tragic character in Juliet"" is a lot closer to a debatable point.Your thesis statement needs to be specific. ""Romeo & Juliet is a play about making bad choices"" isn't as strong a thesis statement as ""Shakespeare makes the argument that the inexperience of teenage love is comic and tragic at the same time"" is much stronger.
A good thesis guides the essay. In your thesis, you can sometimes preview the points you'll make in your paper, guiding yourself and the reader: ""Shakespeare uses Juliet's death, Mercutio's rage, and the petty arguments of the two principal families to illustrate that the heart and the head are forever disconnected.""

, Some teachers teach the ""rule of five"" or the ""five paragraph format"" for writing compositions. This isn't a hard and fast rule, and you don't need to hold yourself to an arbitrary number like ""5,"" but it can be helpful in building your argument and organizing your thoughts to try to aim for at least 3 different supporting points to use to hold up your main argument. but some teachers like their students to come up with:


Introduction, in which the topic is described, the issue or problem is summarized, and your argument is presented
Main point paragraph 1, in which you make and support your first supporting argument
Main point paragraph 2, in which you make and support your second supporting argument
Main point paragraph 3, in which you make and support your final supporting argument
Conclusion paragraph, in which you summarize your argument

, In a good composition, your thesis is like a tabletop--it needs to be held up with the table-legs of good points and evidence, because it can't just float there all by itself. Each point you're going to make should be held up by two kinds of evidence: logic and proof.


Proof includes specific quotes from the book you're writing about, or specific facts about the topic. If you want to talk about Mercutio's temperamental character, you'll need to quote from him, set the scene, and describe him in detail. This is proof that you'll also need to unpack with logic.
Logic refers to your rationale and your reasoning. Why is Mercutio like this? What are we supposed to notice about the way he talks? Explain your proof to the reader by using logic and you'll have a solid argument with strong evidence.

, A common complaint from student writers is that they can't think of anything else to say about a particular topic. Learn to ask yourself questions that the reader might ask to give yourself more material by answering those questions in your draft.


Ask how. How is Juliet's death presented to us? How do the other characters react? How is the reader supposed to feel?
Ask why. Why does Shakespeare kill her? Why not let her live? Why does she have to die? Why would the story not work without her death?

, One mistake that lots of student writers make is spending too much time using the Microsoft Word thesaurus function to upgrade their vocabulary with cheap substitutes. You're not going to trick your teacher by throwing a $40 word into the first sentence if the argument is thin as the paper it's written on. Making a strong argument has much less to do with your wording and your vocabulary and more to do with the construction of your argument and with supporting your thesis with main points.

, It can be tempting to want to call it quits as soon as you get the page count or the word count finished, but you'll be much better off if you let the paper sit for a while and return to it with fresh eyes and be willing to make changes and get the draft revised into a finished product.


Try writing a rough draft the weekend before it's due, and giving it to your teacher for comments several days before the due date. Take the feedback into consideration and make the necessary changes.

, Good writing happens in revision. Break down the word: revision literally means ""to look again"" (re-vision). Many students think that revising is about fixing spelling errors and typos, and while that's certainly a part of proofreading, it's important to know that NO writer writes a perfect argument with flawless organization and construction on their first run-through. You've got more work to do. Try:


Moving paragraphs around to get the best possible organization of points, the best ""flow""
Delete whole sentences that are repetitive or that don't work
Removing any points that don't support your argument

, One of the best ways you can improve a draft in revision is by picking on your points that are too general and making them much more specific. This might involve adding more supporting evidence in the form of quotations or logic, it might involve rethinking the point entirely and shifting the focus, and it might involve looking for entirely new points and new evidence that supports your thesis.


Think of each main point you're making like a mountain in a mountain range that you're flying over in a helicopter. You can stay above them and fly over them quickly, pointing out their features from far away and giving us a quick flyover tour, or you can drop us down in between them and show us up close, so we see the mountain goats and the rocks and the waterfalls. Which would be a better tour?

, One of the best ways to pick on yourself and see if your writing holds up is to sit with your paper in front of you and read it aloud. Does it sound ""right""? Circle anything that needs to be more specific, anything that needs to be reworded or needs to be more clear. When you're through, go right back through and make the additions you need to make to get the best possible draft.

, Don't worry about commas and apostrophes until you're almost ready to turn the draft in. Sentence-level issues, spelling, and typos are called ""late concerns,"" meaning that you should only worry about them when the more important parts of your composition--your thesis, your main points, and the organization of your argument--are already as good as they can be.

Think of an animal to use, picking your favorite animal would make this step very easy.,
Put some character into your animal.,
Make a story.,
Share this small idea with friends and family, brainstorm new ideas, expanding the one idea into a great story.,
Chapter one.,
Spice it up!,
Put in enough time to work on your project.,
THE END.",How to Write a Fictional Story from an Animal's Point of View," I recommend that you do so because, not only will it make it convenient, but it would help you love the characters and the book much more.;
, You can't just make him/her have a wooden personality. Put some emotions in there, use some of your own personality and put it in there, or maybe some of your friend's feelings and little quirks. Add some emotion: happy, sad, angry. Your character is putty in your hands, mold it into something awesome!

, There is no book without a story. First, think of an idea. It must be original, yet interesting. Make something that you KNOW is going to attract an audience.

, Once a storyboard blossoms in your mind, it's time to write!

, Chapter one will introduce the animal in the story. Tell what animal it is, its personality, and its name. Make the animal have an unusual name, something that will draw people's attention towards the character, this will make the reader want to read further and further. When writing the story, don't rush through all of your ideas at once, this will make the story look sloppy and of course, rushed. Take a slow approach, letting the reader warm up to the character before getting to the epic adventure.

, Animals are much cooler than people, make the people believe that! Your animal should be believable. A tiger may not know what to call the things around it, a wild creature doesn't have the same mind as we do. Make up words your animal could use to replace human terms (cars, people, etc.), but be very, very, VERY descriptive when using words like this, so the reader actually knows what you are talking about.

, You have a life outside of the computer screen, but it's still be nice to write a few paragraphs once in a while. Try to get at least two hours a week to try to finish it, unless you really like writing and want to make this more than just a hobby. If you want to pursue a career in writing, you will need to commit much more time.

, At the end of your story, please read through it, look for mistakes, and edit them. Once you are finished, print out a few copies, and give them to friends. Ask for their honest opinion. If you get good feedback, then, maybe you can think about sending it to a publisher. But be warned, not all books get published, you may end up just having your friends be your readers.

Learn your company's medical leave policy.,
Get a note from your doctor, if required.,
Verify the dates you'll be absent.,
Format the letter properly.,
Begin by stating the reasons for your leave and its duration.,
Explain your medical condition, if necessary.,
Let your boss know how you plan to handle work responsibilities when on leave.,
Close with information on how to contact you.,
Thank your boss before adding a closing line.,
Proofread the letter carefully.,
Make sure you follow any formal letter writing guidelines laid out by your office.,
Send the letter out according to company policy.",How to Write a Medical Leave Letter," Before you write your letter, make sure you know your company's policy. When asking for leave, you'll want to make sure you're asking for an appropriate amount of days.You can look in your company's handbook, or online, to find their sick leave policy. You can also talk to the HR Department if anything is still unclear.
You'll want to mention your company's policy in your letter. This both shows that you're adhering to policy and reminds your boss of what you are entitled to as an employee.
If you have questions about your company's medical leave policies, you can always contact your HR department and ask about their specific guidelines.;
, A doctor's note may be required if you're requesting sick leave. This is not always a requirement, and it depends on the policy of your company. If you do need a doctor's note, ask your doctor to provide you one. Do so at least a few weeks in advance (if possible) so you can get all your materials together before you need to take sick leave.

, A medical leave letter needs to be specific. Before submitting your medical leave letter, you should make sure you know the exact dates during which you'll be gone.Double check the date of your procedure. Have your doctor verify how long the recovery will be, and how much time you'll need off work.
Make sure your sick leave falls within the appropriate restrictions of your company's policy.

, Business letters follow a specific format. A medical leave letter is not different. Before writing your letter, make sure it is formatted correctly.Write down your company's address at the top of the letter. Below this, write the date in the format month, date, and year. For example, ""June 5th, 2016.""
When you begin the letter, start with a salutation that begins with ""Dear."" Then, write your boss's name using his or her preferred personal title (e.g., Mr., Mrs., etc.).

, Your introductory paragraph need not be long. You simply need to write the reason for writing the letter, why you need a leave of absence, and the dates you'll be absent from work. As your boss is likely busy, keep this letter brief and to the point.You can begin with something like, ""I am writing this letter to ask for a leave of absence from work for medical reasons. According to company policy, I am entitled to 10 days of medical absence a year.""
From there, state the medical concerns and the dates when you'll be absent. For example, ""I am having my gallbladder removed. My surgery is on Thursday the 16th, and I will require 7 days of recovery. I should be back to work by the following Thursday, the 23rd.""

, If you have an unusual medical condition, it may be necessary to explain. Something like maternity leave is largely self-explanatory, but more unusual reasons for medical leave may require some explanation. This can help your boss see why your leave is necessary. You do not need to provide a lot of details, but a little information can help.For example, you can write something like, ""I am having a suspicious mole removed for a biopsy this Monday. There will be further medical tests to assure I do not have melanoma, which is a form of skin cancer. I will be held up in procedures from Monday to Thursday. I should be able to return to work Friday.""
Be brief when writing your letter; there's no need for embellishment. Just stick to the facts to keep it professional.
If you live in the United States, there are specific laws to protect your privacy, known as HIPAA. Your employer should not request more information than is necessary, and they have obligations to maintain your privacy under certain conditions., Your boss needs to know you plan on keeping up with your responsibilities during your absence. Your boss will want to know the status of your work, and how it will be completed while you're gone.If you're assigning your work to other colleagues, mention this. Make sure you ask the colleagues beforehand and get confirmation that they can take on your projects. Write something like, ""The Henderson account will be managed by Charlie Hanson until my return.""
If you plan on working remotely, let your boss know. For example, ""While I will be laid up after my knee surgery, I'll still be able to carry on much of my duties. I plan to work remotely and Skype into meetings during my absence.""

, Let your boss know how he or she can reach you if you're needed during your absence. Include the best phone number and email your boss can use to contact you.If there's any time you know you'll be unavailable, mention this. For example, ""You can reach me on my regular cell phone most of the time. However, my surgery is Thursday so I will be unable to take work-related calls then.""

, Close the letter by offering your boss a sincere thank you for considering your application. For example, say something like, ""Thank you so much for taking the time to consider my medical leave."" Then, add a formal sign off, like ""sincerely,"" before signing your name at the bottom of the letter.If you're adding an enclosure to the letter, like a doctor's note, make sure to write ""Enclosure"" one line below your name at the bottom of the letter, followed by a description of the enclosure.

, It's a good idea to proofread your letter before you send it out to make sure it's free of obvious errors. If possible, have a friend or colleague quickly proofread your letter before you send it to your boss.Set the letter aside for a few hours and then come back to it with fresh eyes. This can help you catch errors.
You could also try to print the letter out if you typed it. You may have a better chance of catching your own errors when not reading on a screen.

, Check company policy again. They may have special policies for business letters. For example, your office may require specific formatting or may ask that you use the company letterhead.

, Send the letter out when you're done. Make sure you follow company policy regarding how to send letters and memos. Do not, for example, e-mail the letter as an attachment if your boss prefers letters be sent physically.

Follow up within the mandatory timeline.,
Attach your supporting documents.,
Ask your doctor to review your letter.,
Send your letter via certified mail.",How to Write a Medical Claim Appeal Letter," Sometimes a claim is denied due to a simple clerical error. These mistakes are usually the easiest to correct. Read through all the documentation from your insurance company, to make sure there are no obvious errors. If you find that a mistake was made by someone at your doctor's office, contact the office staff and ask them to submit corrected forms to your insurance company. If the mistake appears to have been made by someone at your insurance company, call them, point out the error, and ask them to send you updated documents with the correct information.Check that your name is spelled correctly, in case the insurance company has confused your file with someone else's. Also check your insurance policy ID number and the date that the procedure was performed, to be sure they were entered correctly.
Check the procedure code to make sure it is correct. If you aren't sure, you may need to verify this with your doctor, your insurance provider, or both.
Check your doctor's name and information against your policy to make sure that your insurance company has approved your doctor for coverage. Make sure everything is spelled correctly.
Read through the description of the services rendered, and make sure it is an accurate representation of the procedure that was provided.;
, If your insurance company denied a claim for a procedure that your health care provider deemed necessary, there may be a discrepancy between the wording of your doctor's statement and the wording of your insurance policy's guidelines. Take a copy of your insurance company's guidelines to your doctor's office. The doctor may be able to rephrase his or her statement so that it more precisely aligns with your insurance company's guidelines.Print out the part of your insurance company's “clinical policy guidelines” that pertains to your case. Google the name of your insurance company and the words “medical policies” or “clinical policies” to find the correct documentation.
Often, the insurance company's guidelines are posted on their web site for the convenience of practitioners, but are also accessible to members.
Even if you don't understand the technical jargon used by your insurance company, your doctor will. Print out the entire section pertaining to your treatment, and ask if he or she will take a look at it.

, Call your insurance company and ask them to explain why your medical claim was denied. Don't let the agent intimidate you, or try to confuse you – don't end the call until you understand their reasoning completely.Be as patient and polite as possible when speaking with your insurance agent. It most likely wasn't that person's fault that your claim was denied, and they may be more willing to help you during the process if you are on friendly terms. For example, you can begin your call by saying, ""Hello, I'm calling to try to understand why I received a notice that a claim for medical services was denied. Could you explain it to me?"" (The agent will then undoubtedly need some specific information about your claim, which you should be able to provide.)
If you get upset during the call, acknowledge that you are stressed about your claim. Apologize for losing your cool, and tell the agent that you know the situation is not his or her fault. If this happens, just pause, take a deep breath, and then go on: ""I'm sorry, but I hope you can understand how important this is for me to understand. Could you please explain that again?""

, Call your insurance company to request copies of any relevant documentation that is missing from your files. If any corrections or changes were made to your file as a result of a phone conversation, ask your insurance company to send copies of the new, amended documents.You will need the official denial letter.
You will need a copy detailing your policy coverage. Sometimes called the “Evidence of Coverage,” this document should explain the guidelines your insurance company uses to determine whether a medical procedure is medically necessary.
You can also check online to see if your insurance company has posted their Evidence of Coverage.

, When speaking to your insurance company, keep detailed notes for future use. Write a short summary of the conversation, and keep your notes in the same file as your documentation.Make note of the name of the person you spoke with, his or her job title, and the date and time of the call.
Ask for the “call reference number” at the end of the conversation. This may help eliminate the need to repeat your case every time you call.
If an appeal has been submitted, ask for the “document image number.” This may help the telephone agent pull up your information more quickly the next time you call.

, Call your insurance company and ask what steps you need to take to appeal a negative decision. You don't need to make this confrontational. Appealing a claim is just a part of the business. But you will need help in understanding the process.If you have decided that you will be filing an appeal, simply ask, ""Will you please explain to me what I need to do to appeal this decision?""
Ask your insurance company if they require any specific forms. If so, have them sent to you immediately, or find out if they are available online.
The explanation of benefits that you received when you opened your policy should contain details of your insurance company's appeals process.
Find out what your deadline is for filing an appeal. The agent should be able to give you a specific deadline. Be sure that you make a note of it and mark it on your calendar.

, Before you begin writing your letter, collect all the pertinent information in one file. You may want to refer to specific documents when writing your letter. In particular, get together any of the following:notes from your visit to the doctor
a copy of your insurance policy contract, with relevant language highlighted
a copy of the letter denying your claim
a copy of any bills or notices you may have received regarding the claim
any notes you have from prior telephone conversations regarding the claim.

, Call your doctor's office as soon as you become aware of the problem. Ask for written documentation of your case, specifically outlining the procedure and why it was medically necessary.Your doctor may also make copies of notes from your charts that you could include.
Ask your doctor's office to supply you with copies of any medical records that relate to your case. The more proof you have to support your claim, the better., If you find any information about your procedure that supports its efficacy or necessity, make copies of the article. Be sure your information is collected from authoritative, peer-reviewed medical sources., Start with your name, address, policy number, claim number, and any other reference numbers you may have collected (through letters or over the phone) that identify your case.Include your insurance policy number, admission and discharge dates, and the exact amount of charges you are claiming.
Rather than including this detailed information in sentence form in your letter, it is probably most helpful to provide it in a reference line at the top of your letter. For example, your own name and address will appear at the top of the page, and then the address of the appeals office, as in a standard business letter. Then, a line or two below the address, write ""Re: Claim No. 12345, Policy No. A678."" Then go on with your letter, ""Dear Sir or Madam.""

, Note in the first paragraph of the letter your medical provider's name and the date the services in question were rendered.If your insurance company appeals process lists a specific person to whom appeals should be directed, address your letter to that person.
In the opening paragraph, explain your situation: ""I am a patient of Dr. Smith, and I am writing to appeal the denial of a procedure he performed on July 1, 2016.""

, Explain your medical condition and the way that it affects your life. Tell your insurance company why you need the prescribed procedure, equipment, or service.Be polite when choosing your words, and try not to allow your frustration to be too apparent in your letter. It is always more helpful, in a letter like this, to limit yourself to factual information, rather than emotional.

, Outline your reasoning as to why the medical procedure should be covered by your insurance policy. Use your own words and try to avoid medical jargon.If you are appealing only part(s) of a claim, identify which part(s) you are disputing.

, Describe the additional documents you are including, and why you believe they support your case. If you believe the service in question will help prevent future expenses, such as hospital readmission or problematic side effects, be sure to explain why.Make specific references to relevant attached documents as you write your letter. Highlight important passages in your supporting documents. For example, you might say, ""In particular, I believe that Paragraph 17 of the Insurance Policy Coverage Statement (page 26), states that this type of procedure should be covered.""

, A very persuasive argument is to demonstrate that paying this claim will save the insurance company money later on. If your insurance company denies coverage for a certain procedure, you can try to persuade them that approving this claim will cost them less money in the long run.Example of a denied claim: An insurance company denies a claim to pay for equipment needed to administer medication at home via a J-tube (a jejunostomy feeding tube vents a patient's stomach for air or drainage, and/or to supply an alternative method for feeding the patient or administering medication).
Example of the appeals case: The insured explains to the insurance company that if they do not cover this claim of $200 per month, the only alternative would be to have the patient's many medications administered intravenously at the hospital, at a cost of more than $1,000 per day.

, Specifically ask your insurance provider to review your claim again. Indicate whether the information in the first claim was correct or if some information had been amended., Thank the recipient for his or her time and prompt attention. Include your phone number, email address, or any other convenient way you can be reached.


Include contact information for both yourself and your doctor.
A typical closing paragraph might say, ""If you have any further questions about this appeal or my claim, you may call me at 555-1234, or you may contact my doctor, Dr. John Smith, at 555-6789.""

, Preparing your appeal letter may take some time, but you must submit it before the deadline expires. Never expect the insurance company to follow up with you – be proactive. If you miss the deadline, you risk losing the opportunity to have your case reviewed., Include in the envelope any documentation you collected regarding your case. Staple the documents to your letter, so they have less chance of being misplaced when your letter is opened.Attach a letter from your doctor, especially if you were able to procure a rephrased statement that more closely aligns with the stated policies of your insurance company.
Include any medical records you obtained, and any notes your doctor may have made about your case.
Include copies of any relevant medical journal articles you find that support the procedure in question as being medically relevant.

, If you believe that your doctor would be willing to review your case, ask him or her to read your letter before posting it. Your doctor may notice a detail you have missed or an aspect of the case you have misunderstood., Request a return receipt, so you will have proof that your insurance company received your letter by the deadline. If your letter is lost in the mail or misplaced by your insurance company, you will be able to prove exactly when you mailed the letter.Keep at least one copy of the letter, the postal delivery receipt and tracking number, and copies of any correspondence pertaining to your claim.

Come up with a funny scenario.,
Create a humorous character.,
Put an original spin on a familiar idea.,
Read good examples of the genre.",How to Write a Comedy1," Start with a scenario that is funny and entertaining. Think about a funny situation in your own life. Often, a funny scenario will have a minor conflict, interesting characters, and a punchline, or major funny moment. Read news stories and talk to friends to find a humorous scenarioFor example, you may come up with a funny scenario based on your parent’s divorce and then remarriage several years later. Or you may fictionalize a relationship gone bad in your own life and make it funny.;
, Another way you can come up with an idea for a comedy is to build a character that is funny and witty. Use people in your life that you find funny as models for the character. Take an existing fictional character and put a humorous spin on them. The character can then be the protagonist in the comedy and add humor to every scene.For example, you may create a character based on your mother, using humorous things she has said to you in the past as the character’s dialogue. Or you may take a serious historical person like Virginia Woolf and add humorous details like a funny voice to create a character.

, Think about ideas in comedy you have seen or read before. Then, try to put your own spin on these ideas. Turn a familiar idea into an original one using your creativity.For example, you may take the familiar idea of an awkward first dinner with the parents and have the couple dress in matching outfits to make it a bit silly.

, Immerse yourself in the world of comedy by reading lots of good examples of the genre, from novels to plays to short stories. You can also flip through comedy screenplays for ideas and inspiration. Some good examples include:The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare

In your first letter, you should introduce yourself in a general way. Offer info about your home life, hobbies, and interests. Even obvious things that your pen pal probably already knows can be included in your introductory letter.
For instance, you might introduce yourself by writing, “I am twelve years old. I live with my father and two sisters. I am in sixth grade and my favorite subject is history. In my spare time I enjoy reading and playing X-Box.”
Don’t write everything about your life all at once.You'll have plenty of time to share things with your pen pal as you grow closer.
Be specific. For instance, don’t say that you like film, crafts, and exercise. Instead, say that you enjoy Marvel movies, knitting and needlework, and riding your bike.
As you get to know your pen pal better, you will be better equipped to respond to his or her perspectives, sense of humor, and ideas in the body of your letter. You will also feel more comfortable expressing yourself and confiding in your pen pal. The more you write to your pen pal, the easier it will be to know what topics are of interest to both of you.

, If writing to a pen pal in prison, do not include self-incriminating information. Prison mail is screened carefully and you might get in trouble when prison staff discovers your secrets.If you are an undocumented immigrant, do not include this fact in your letters -- you never know who your pen pal is sharing their correspondence with. Information about your income or wages should also remain confidential.


Do not share too much too soon.
You may want to rent a PO box if you don’t feel comfortable with a stranger knowing where you live.

, Ask questions about your pen pal’s work, hobbies, and family. Invite your pen pal to share their feelings on a variety of common interests. Develop a genuine curiosity about your pen pal and don’t be shy when writing.


For instance, if your pen pal mentions he or she does track and field, ask how fast they can run, if they’ve ever participated in a relay race, and what the furthest distance they’ve ever run is.

, While you will have lots of questions about your pen pal and his/her life, you need to stay cognizant of their boundaries. If you’re writing to a pen pal overseas, they might assume a different level of familiarity and comfort with you than you do with them. It may be awkward for them to talk candidly about certain topics. If you sense some reticence on the part of you pen pal, avoid snooping into their habits and life. If your pen pal doesn’t answer certain questions, don’t ask them again and assume the topic is sensitive.


Alternately, if your pen pal is more direct and insists on certain boundaries, respect them. For instance, if your pen pal does not want to talk about their sexuality or family life, do not insist they do so.Similarly, do not feel obligated to confess everything about yourself if you are not comfortable doing so. If your pen pal tries to engage you on a certain topic or issue you do not want to talk about, don’t feel as if you have to open up to them. Let your pen pal know in a direct way if there are any topics which you do not want to talk about. Like any other friend, your pen pal should be respectful of your boundaries and mindful of your feelings.

, The final part of your letter is the closing. Pen a final paragraph saying goodbye to your pen pal and leave him or her with something to think over or answer. For instance, you might close with a few brief sentences which conclude the main idea you’ve traced through the letter.For example, if your letter was mainly about how excited you are for summer, you might write, “With luck, the weather will clear up here soon. I really want to start swimming again. How about you? Do you like swimming, too? Or are there other summer sports you’re interested in? Hope to hear from you soon.”
Skip two lines and write “Sincerely,” “Take it easy,” or “Until next time,” with your signature on the line just below the final word you write.

, The envelope should include both a return address (your address) and the receiver’s address. Write your address in the upper left corner of the envelope. Write your name first, then your street address below that, and then on a third line, write your city, state, and zip code. Follow the same format for the receiver’s address, but put it in the center of the envelope.


Don’t forget to add postage. It’s a good idea to take your letter to the post office the first time you send it out so that you know which stamps you need to mail it, especially if your pen pal is in a foreign country. If your pen pal resides within the US, you could use forever stamps, which cover the cost of mailing a letter no matter how the price of postage to or from a particular place fluctuates.
Drop your letter in the mailbox or bring it to the post office for delivery.

, Your pen pal, like you, is a busy person. Don’t expect a reply overnight. Wait at least two weeks for a reply. If your pen pal doesn’t write back within two weeks, send them another letter or -- assuming you have their email address -- an email.Many people are used to instantaneous communication via email, texting, and phones, and consider letter-writing a waste of time. However, one of the virtues of writing letters is that it does take time and thus requires (and instills) patience.

, If you only want to write twice a month, let your pen pal know. Conversely, if you can write every week, or multiple times each week, tell your pen pal. There are no obligations regarding how often you should write, but whatever you decide, let your pen pal know up front so that they don’t expect more from you.Conversely, if you want a more committed pen pal but have not found one, keep looking. Do not feel that you need to limit yourself to just one pen pal at a time.

, Lots of little things make great gifts for your pen pal. If your pen pal lives in another country, they might be interested in coins from your native country. You could also include recent articles you think your pen pal might find of interest, and reference them in the text of your letter. If you are very close to your pen pal and feel comfortable, you could send a photo of yourself doing a fun activity.If writing to a pen pal in prison, ask if they can receive certain items before sending them.Each prison sets its own guidelines regarding what is and is not allowed in personal correspondence.
Decorate your letter. If you’re artistic, include little drawings or sketches to illustrate your text. Include stickers to add a personal touch.

, If, for instance, your pen pal comments that they started a new job, ask them in your reply how they like it, if their coworkers are kind, and so on. Take an interest in what they are going through.If your pen pal has questions, answer them. If there are any questions you don’t want to answer, tell your pen pal directly.
Ask for photos of your pen pal’s pets, collections, and art.

, Let the conversation between you and your pen pal develop naturally.


Reference major events in your life, like attending a movie, concert, or play; having a good or bad dining experience; getting an award at school; or learning a new skill like cooking. Don’t reduce yourself to a mere reporter; instead, offer a thoughtful analysis of some of the recent developments in your life.
For instance, instead of flatly stating, “I saw the new Captain America movie yesterday,” and leaving it at that, say, “I saw the new Captain America movie. I loved all the characters that were included from the many other Marvel films. The cinematography and acting were, in my view, the best in the series. You should check it out!”

, In your letters, comment upon things that your pen pal might also have experience with or opinions about, such as news stories or your work life. For instance, you could write, “I am really excited about Candidate X. I donated to her campaign and volunteered to go door-to-door on her behalf. How about you? Do you plan on voting?”

, Use social media like Facebook and Tumblr to connect more deeply with your pen pal. Staying in touch this way ensures your friendship blossoms during the interim between getting each other’s letters.Don’t let social media or digital communication replace your letter-writing relationship. While modern forms of communication are important, they offer no substitute for the joy which letter-writing provides.

, Are you doing research on a certain topic? Practicing a foreign language? Learning more about life and culture in another land? Depending on your interests and purpose in writing to a pen pal, you will make different choices about who you opt to connect with.For instance, if you are interested in learning German, you should connect with a pen pal from Germany, Austria, or a German speaker in another country.
If you are interested in learning more about Japan, you should identify pen pals in Japan who can share their insights into Japanese society.

, If you’re interested in simply making a friend, it might be beneficial to write to someone with whom you share some common ground. Try to write to someone who is about your age and has similar interests.


For instance, if you are a 17-year-old punk rocker, you will be unlikely to gain much from your exchange with a 45-year-old businessman. Try to locate pen pals who you think are interesting and who you can really look forward to writing to.
Many pen pal clubs exist which cater to specific subsets of the population. For instance, there are certain pen pal clubs which cater only to teen and tween girls; others are exclusively for students.Of course, you don’t have to find a clone of yourself to have a great pen pal. Sometimes we learn more about ourselves and the world we live in by interacting with people who are very different from us., Pen Pal World, Penpals Now, and Letter Writers Alliance are just some of the many sites which facilitate letter writing connections.


Some pen pal connection services require payment, while some are free. Both can provide good pen pals, but check what kind of service you’re enrolling with before you get too excited about the sign-up process.

Follow the standard comedy plot.,
Use running jokes.,
Build up to a major laugh.,
Include reversals.,
Write with a partner.",How to Write a Comedy2," The plot of a comedy usually involves at least one character who has a want, but a series of funny, unfortunate events get in the way of their want. Their want is what they want to gain from life, from someone else, or for themselves. The plot usually ends with the character getting what they want or failing in a funny, over-the-top way. The key is to have enough funny events to keep the reader engaged, as well as a main character they can root for.For example, you may have a comedy plot where your main character wants to graduate high school and go to college. But his troublemaker best friend comes for a visit. Together, they get into funny and slightly dangerous situations that could prevent the main character from graduating.

, A running joke is a joke that is returned to more than once over the course of a comedy. Running jokes are a great way to call back to earlier moments of humor and make the reader laugh. Sprinkle running jokes throughout the comedy so the text feels concise and smartly written.For example, you may write a joke about a character’s hairstyle. Then, later in the comedy, you may have another character comment on the same hairstyle in a more ridiculous way.

, Most good comedies will have a major laugh or humorous high point. This high point could be the climax of the story or the key moment of humor. It may appear about ¾ of the way into the text or towards the end of the text.

For example, you may build up the text by including small, slightly dangerous scenarios. Keep building until you reach a very funny, intense scenario that means life or death for your main character.

, Reversals are when you reverse or subvert the reader’s expectations. Doing this can keep the reader engaged and force them to pay attention to the text. Try to include as many reversals as you can in the comedy to up the laugh factor.For example, rather than have a regular car come pick up two characters at valet parking, have a cop car come pick them up. Or rather than have a regular server at a restaurant, make the server the father of the main character.

, Many successful comedy writers work with a writing partner or a team of writers. Having another person to write comedy with can make it easier for you to bounce off ideas and thoughts with someone else. Often, if you can make your writing partner laugh with a joke or idea, it’s worth putting in the comedy.You may ask a friend or peer to be your writing partner. You may also approach someone in the writing community that you admire or find funny, and ask them to be your writing partner.

Show the comedy to others.,
Read the comedy out loud.,
Revise the comedy for clarity and humor.",How to Write a Comedy3," Once you have a draft of the comedy, show it to friends, family, and peers for feedback. Ask them if they find the comedy funny and engaging. Notice where they laugh and where a joke falls flat. Be receptive to constructive criticism and listen to what they have to say., A good comedy will sound funny or even funnier than it does on the page. Read the draft aloud to yourself and to others. Notice if any parts of the comedy are confusing or wordy. Adjust them so the jokes land and have the most impact on the reader or listener.If you have multiple characters in your comedy, you may ask friends to read the different voices of the characters aloud. This way, you can determine if each character sounds funny and interesting on the page.

, Edit the comedy so it is easy to follow and has the most laughs. Make sure each scene has been milked for as much humor as possible. This will ensure the comedy is enjoyable and successful for your readers.

Once you revise, you could then consider sending out the comedy to publishers and magazines so you can share it with a wider audience.

Emphasize comedy in screenwriting with dialogue.,
Use long-term character development in a comedic novel.,
Surprise the reader in a comedic play.",How to Write a Comedy4," Use dialogue to add humour to a screenplay. Have witty back and forth between characters. Have one character who is full of funny one-liners. Create running jokes that are said throughout the screenplay by different characters. Dialogue gives you a chance to have your characters tell jokes to one another and be witty.For example, you may have one character who uses a signature catch phrase and tone of voice to say their dialogue, creating humor.

, Develop a character over a long period of a time in a novel so they become endearing, witty, and funny to the reader. Give them a funny childhood or a unique sense of humor. Let the character's voice and actions come through as the novel progresses and add in funny or amusing details about the character. The reader will then get a sense of humor from the character.For example, you may have a character who seems minor in the story but always has a funny aside. You may then have them become more important as the novel progresses, putting their humor front and center.

, The element of surprise can be a fun way to jolt your reader and make them laugh. Have a plot twist in the play that you find funny and surprising. Keep the viewer guessing and use the element of suspense to create surprise and laughter.For example, you may have a big reveal 3/4 of the way into the play where a character turns out to be a woman dressed as a man. You may stage the reveal so it is funny and surprising for your audience.

, For best results, you will want to write a formal letter and address the district attorney appropriately.The envelope: The Honorable (Full name), District Attorney of (city or county)
Letter salutation: Dear Mr. / Madame District Attorney:

, Make your letter as brief as possible while still including all the required information. Even if you are upset – e.g. you are a victim writing because our case is not being prosecuted – try to keep you letter formal and respectful. This is the best way to ensure a positive response., If you are a defendant – in traffic court, for instance – and wish for more time to prepare your defense, you can sometimes write the district attorney for a continuance, though in some jurisdictions, you will need to appear in person to do so.State the reason you need a continuance – i.e. to prepare your defense – in your letter.

, All 50 states allow victim impact statements, which allow victims to indicate the toll the crime has take on them, and which may impact the judge’s sentence. These statements may include descriptions of:Injury caused by the crime
Emotional damage caused by the crime
Financial cost of the crime
Medical or psychological treatments required by the victim
The victim’s views on the crime and the appropriate punishment

, During the course of a trial, you may need to send written statements or other information to the district attorney, or ask questions.

, Anything you write to the district attorney may be admissible as evidence in your case. Accordingly, your lawyer should handle all communication with the prosecution.

, In some states, you will need to write to a special agency to obtain these records, but in most states, you can write to your local district attorney. You can find a form information request letter for each state here. You will typically have to pay a per-page fee for any document produced. Be sure to include as much information as possible, including:Name of defendant(s)
Indictment or docket number
Approximate date of the trial

, If a crime is happening at that moment, call 911. Otherwise, write or call your local police department to report most crimes, including theft, vandalism, assault, or nuisance complaints.

, Cases of public corruption should be brought directly to the attention of the district attorney. Give as much information as you can on the crime. The cases DAs will investigate vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but often include:Public corruption
Criminal acts by members of the judiciary
Election violations
Fraud involving large amounts (typically over $300,000)
Environmental crimes

, DAs typically have 1 to 2 years to bring charges, and a trial may be delayed by workload or the need to gather evidence.That said, if you are a victim and feel that the DA is failing to pursue your case, you can write a letter encouraging him or her to do so. For best results, be sure to add a cc list, letting the DA know that you have also sent the letter to other important people, including his or her boss. People to consider putting in your cc: include:Local officials – the mayor, city council members, judges, etc.
Local leaders- A prominent clergy person, business leaders, etc.
Appropriate organizations and issue Groups – NAACP, National Organization for Victim Assistance, American Civil Liberties Union, National Organization for Women, etc.
State and national officials – attorney general, state and national congress people, governor
Local newspapers and journalists

, All states have laws that require the government to give citizens access to public records. If the government fails to turn over records, the next step is usually to contact the local district attorney to lodge a criminal complaint.Be sure to specify as precisely as possible the documents you requested and to include a copy of any rejection notice sent to you.

, Even if you were at fault, DAs will often reduce the level of the fine or change the nature of the charge so no points accrue to your license if you have a previously clean driving record. There is no guarantee your letter will succeed, but as it only costs you a few minutes and a stamp, it’s worth a try.

, The DA will likely contact the officer who pulled you over to ask about the incident. Officers take notes on each stop, and if you were rude, he will let the DA know. That will likely mean the failure of your request, since the success of your letter depends on the DA’s good will., You can call or email the clerk of the court for the county or city where you received your ticket to discover the District Attorney for your case.

, A clean driving record can help convince the DA to reduce the penalty against you. The state department that issues drivers licenses will also be able to provide you with your driving record. See here for information on how to obtain your record in your state.

, Keep your letter short and to the point. There are several things you will want to include:Mention that you are not contesting your speed or the speed zone in the area.
Explain why you were speeding – i.e. you did not realize the new speed limit after transitioning from a faster speed zone.
Apologize and indicate that you will watch your speed more closely in the future.
Mention your clean driving record and attach it.
Ask for a reduced fine and/or a reduction in charges to a non-point violation.

Prison systems are run by the state, not the county, so in searching for the prison website, you might search for the state's Department of Corrections, before navigating to the specific regional facility where the inmate lives., Some prisons require you to include the inmate's name and number with the address on the envelope. Locate the inmate's number by using the inmate database, or call the prison and request the inmate's number number for the purpose of sending a piece of mail to the prison.


In Arizona, for example, an inmate's number is called the ""ADC"" number, for ""Arizona Department of Corrections.""

If you want to write a letter of a romantic or sexual nature, you can, as long as you are comfortable with prison officials reading it as well.Refrain from writing about illegal activities or ongoing investigations related to the inmate's case.

Determine the content of your signature.,
Print your signature.,
Determine how legible you want your signature to be.,
Begin making changes to your signature.,
Perfect your signature.",How to Create a Personalized Signature1," If you were to look at the signatures of a thousand different people, you would probably notice that they not only vary significantly in their appearance, but also in the content of their signatures. Some people sign their entire name, some just their last, and some just their initials. Start by deciding exactly what you want to include in your signature


If you’re concerned about forgery, it may be a better option to make your signature a bit longer and legible by including your entire first and last name and writing clearly. It is so much easier to forge scribbled signatures than to copy the nuances of a legible one.
Signatures that include just your initials (with or without the middle initial) are typically considered more formal and business-like than full-name signatures.
Sometimes, people who don’t like their first name will leave it out entirely and sign with just their surname, or they may include just their first initial.;
, Before moving up into signing your name, start by printing it over and over. You may find that in the process of recreating your printed signature, you automatically begin to add flourishes and details in appropriate areas. Printing your signature will help you to analyze where you want to add or detract, and what should be embellished and what shouldn’t.


Determine your favorite qualities of your printed signature. Do you like the slant, size, shapes of certain letters? Keep track of these so that you can recreate them when personalizing your signature.
Pay attention to the size of your handwriting. Studies show that people with very small signatures tend to be overlooked, while people with very large signatures often are arrogant or grandiose. Try to keep your printed/signed name at an average size, similar to the size of your regular writing., Before moving from printing to signing, you should aim for a certain level of legibility. Some people’s signatures are equally as legible as their print, while others look like scratches or scribbles on a page and are completely illegible. Although you want to make your signature difficult to replicate (which may come with illegibility), you want to stay true to your personality and avoid cluttering your signature.To make your signature more difficult to read, you can either push letters closer together, or flatten them and spread them further apart.
If you don’t want to make your signature easy to read, avoid doing so by leaving out letters or using bad handwriting. These tactics are unprofessional and won’t make your signature look all that great.

, On a piece of paper, practice signing your name in multiple different ways, trying out some of the changes you would like to make. Start small, and work your way up to bigger changes in the way you sign your name (rather than jumping into something totally new right away). Some options for changes may include:


Greatly increasing the size of the capitalized letters in your name.
Adding a flourish to the tail ends of letters (particularly ‘T,’ ‘Y,’ ‘E,’ and ‘G’).
Changing the shape of round/elliptical letters (particularly ‘O,’ ‘U,’ ‘C,’ ‘R,’ ‘B,’ and ‘P’).
Incorporating traditional cursive and calligraphy into your signature.
Underlining parts of your name.
Adding additional shapes and decorative elements.

, When you’ve chosen all that you want to add/detract from your current signature, start the work of incorporating in each aspect into your handwriting. Don’t make a huge change in your signature right away, as it will feel unnatural and you will likely forget some changes that you intended to make. Instead, slowly add and drop elements over the course of a few weeks until you have created a personalized signature.


Practice writing your signature on a daily basis to help expedite this process.
Consistency is a key element in changing your signature. If you can’t keep your signature relatively the same between each signing, then you should probably limit the number of changes you’re making.
When in doubt, less is more. Although you may want to have a hugely elaborate signature, for the first few months that just might not happen. Keep it simple, and over time add more detail.

Place the source document over a light source.,
Trace over their writing.,
Attempt to recreate the handwriting without a source document.",How to Copy Someone's Handwriting1," In order to trace someone’s handwriting, you will need to locate a good source document that offers examples of most letters. In order to trace it, the document should not be on particularly thick paper, as light will need to pass through.If you find a good example of handwriting you like online, print it out onto a sheet of regular printer paper.
Historical documents with decorative handwriting can be found many places online, and copies of documents can be found at museums and national parks for purchase.;
, There are a number of options when it comes to using a light source to trace handwriting, depending on your budget. Regardless of your choice, place the original over the light source, then place a blank sheet of paper over it. You may choose to use tracing paper, but most white sheets of paper will work provided they aren’t too thick. You should be able to see the handwriting on the original through your blank sheet of paper. Some light source options are:Architect Tables are desks with internal light sources that light your documents from below as you work on them.
Light boxes are usually made of wood, with a white plastic top and an internal light source. They are usually small enough to place on top of a desk or table to use in the same way as an architect table.
Windows can suffice if you don’t mind writing with your documents upright instead of flat on a table. Simply tape your original to the window, then place your blank piece of paper over the original on the window. Pencils work better than pens when using this method.

, Now that you have the original document lit from below or behind and a blank sheet of paper over it, trace over the handwriting on the document. Pay close attention to how each letter is shaped as you trace them.Once you have traced the entire document, use a new blank sheet of paper to keep practicing.
Choose individual letters or words to trace for practice or trace the entire document.
Choosing a document that uses all of the letters in the alphabet will ensure you can capture how each letter is formed.

, Once you have practiced this method a number of times, place the source document nearby as a reference and attempt to write in that style freehand.When you forget how to properly shape a letter, refer to the original document as a refresher.
Form new words so you are not getting too caught up in copying the content of the source.
Keep practicing or go back to tracing until you have mastered the style.

, Make sure you have a dictionary on hand in case you come across unfamiliar or archaic words.

, Looking at the big picture can help identify the document’s intention, which can help you understand the text. Certain documents may use particular phrases, jargon, and abbreviations, so it is important to understand what type of document you are working with.Is it a personal document, like a letter or journal entry? If so, you may run in to more personalized, unique phrases or character formations.
Is it an official government ledger, like a tax record or a census record? If so, you may come across frequently used legal terms and official, government abbreviations. Knowing this information can help point you to the right resources., Placing the document within a historical context is immensely helpful for successfully reading the handwriting and understanding its meaning.

Ask someone else to read your work.,
Revise your work.",How to Write a Summary," Don't take any notes this time -- just take in the bare minimum to wrap your mind around the basic plot of the book or article. You'll be able to concentrate on the smaller things later.


Think of the focus while you're reading. Get down the most basic of questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? This bare bones thinking can help you to effectively and quickly write a pertinent summary., In order to write an accurate summary, you must understand what you're reading. Try reading with the author's purpose in mind.


Take notes and highlight as you read. Take note of the subheadings, even if there aren't any. Dividing it into sections in your mind will help you organize your summary.
Consider why you have been assigned the text. Write down the author's main point and the main points of each section. Look for the writer's thesis and underline it. This is the main idea of the work., This serves as the skeleton of your summary. Write down the support points of each section, but do not go into minor detail.


It'll benefit you to write it in your own words now; that will save you time translating later. If you can't get around copying from the original, put quotation marks around it. Only do this with incredibly important sentences that cannot be reworded., This automatically lets your readers know your intentions and that you're covering the work of another author.


Clearly identify (in the present tense) the background information needed for your summary: the type of work, title, author, and main point. Example: In the featured article ""Five Kinds of Learning,"" the author, Holland Oates, justifies his opinion on the hot topic of learning styles -- and adds a few himself., Omit nothing important and strive for overall coherence through appropriate transitions. Write using ""summarizing language."" Your reader needs to be reminded that this is not your own work. Use phrases like the article claims, the author suggests, etc.Present the material in a neutral fashion.Your opinions, ideas, and interpretations should be left in your brain -- don't put them into your summary. Be conscious of choosing your words. Only include what was in the original work.Be concise. This is a summary -- it should be much shorter than the original piece. If you're working on an article, give yourself a target length of 1/4 the original article.

, This is not a statement of your own point of view, however; it should reflect the significance of the book or article from the author's standpoint.Without rewriting the article, summarize what the author wanted to get across. Be careful not to evaluate in the conclusion or insert any of your own assumptions or opinions.

, A summary is slightly different than any other creative work -- you must maintain a voice that's current with the author's 100% of the time. Revisit the article as you go over your work -- are you jumping to any conclusions?


Does your summary make the same points as the article itself? Have you omitted anything important? Have you concentrated too much on the finer details?

, Another person may see an argument or point in a completely different light than you have, giving you a new feel for the work and yours.


Not only should they be comparing your work for accuracy, ask them to read it for flow and summation. Can that person understand the sense of the article by reading your summary?Don't hesitate to ask for criticism; then weigh those criticisms and make valid changes.

, Now that you've monitored your work for accuracy and efficacy of tone and writing, make your small changes. Tweak the wording and transitions to make it as easy to read as possible.


Don't forget to look for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors! Your credibility will seriously be questioned if you've glossed over the most basic of mistakes.
Submit your work -- before the deadline.

Choose a medium for your source cards.,
Find the author of the book.,
Find the title of the book.,
Look for the publisher, place of publication, and date of publication.,
Add a line about where you found the source.,
Order your sources cards by number.",How to Write a Source Card1," Often, notecards (also known as index cards) are used to make source cards, as they are neat and easy to reference, but you can also create a list in a notebook or on your computer.Make sure to keep all the information in the same place, as this will make it easier for you to write your reference list later, once you've finished writing your paper.
This article will focus on how to write your source cards on notecards, but the same technique can be applied to writing source cards in a notebook or on your computer.;
, The author’s name will be on the outside cover of the book, as well as on the inside title page. As you will eventually alphabetize the source cards by the authors' last names, put the author’s last name in the upper left-hand corner of the notecard, on the first line. Place a comma after the name, then list the author’s first name and middle name or initial (if provided). For example, if the author’s name is “Bobby Dee Brown,” it will look like this:


Brown, Bobby Dee.







, Underneath the author's name, you will include the title of the book, along with the subtitle (if it has one). The title and subtitle will be listed on the cover and the title page. If the book does have a subtitle, use a colon to separate the main title from the subtitle.In the example below, “Cats Like to Jump” is the main title and “Cats and Their Peculiarities” is the subtitle:


Brown, Bobby Dee.
Cats Like to Jump: Cats and Their Peculiarities
When writing out source cards by hand, the title of the book should always be underlined, so it is easy to identify. If you are typing out your source cards on a computer, however, the title of the book should be placed in italics instead.

, All of this information is generally on the back of the title page, though sometimes it can be found on the front side, as well. This information should be written on the line beneath the book title. Put the city of publication first, followed by a colon, and then the publisher. After the publisher, add a comma and then the date. In the example below, “Kansas City” is the city of publication, while “Brown Prairie Publishing"" is the publishing company and “2011” is the date:


Brown, Bobby Dee.
Cats Like to Jump: Cats and Their Peculiarities
Kansas City: Brown Prairie Publishing, 2011.

, With so much information online these days, some citation styles require you to list where you found the information, so it’s important to know where the source came from. Even if you just found the book at the library, you should include that information on the source card, in case you need to find the book again. It should look something like this:


Brown, Bobby Dee.
Cats Like to Jump: Cats and Their Peculiarities
Kansas City: Brown Prairie Publishing, 2011.
Kansas State University Library.

, If you like, you can also include a number in the upper right-hand corner of the card, starting with “1” on your first source.

Then when you are writing out notes for your paper, you can just include the reference number for each source card beside the relevant information in your notes. This will significantly speed up the referencing process when it comes to actually writing your paper.






However, it’s still safer to include the author’s name and the date of publication (or a shortened form of the title) next to the information when taking notes. This way, if you lose your source cards for whatever reason, you can still easily identify the source for the notes you took.

Locate a source document to analyze.,
Find and analyze each letter individually.,
Start with the source document directly above your paper.,
Practice and compare your writing to the source document.",How to Copy Someone's Handwriting2," Find a document that offers as many of the letters in the alphabet as possible to ensure you have a good grasp of how to write each letter. If you can blow the writing up into a larger image, it may help you to identify the correct way to draw each letter.


You may be able to scan a document and then blow up the image with your computer.
The more space between letters and words, the easier it will be to identify the different letters and how they are drawn.

, Look for each letter within the source document and analyze the way it is shaped. Look at the angle the letter is written at, if there are any decorative touches, and the way the letter is shaped as a whole.Recreate each letter individually with a particular focus on the separate elements of the letter. Tails or serifs, for instance, can change the shape of a letter through the use of decorative additions.
Focus on creating one letter at a time until you have mastered it.

, It’s important that you keep the source document close by as you practice the elements of the handwriting you are attempting to copy. In order to do so, keep the sheet you are writing on just below the source document when you begin.Look at the source document as often as you look at your sheet to ensure that the way you are writing matches what you are copying.
Eventually move on to just keeping the source document close by as a reference, once you have a better grasp of the style.

, Once you have practiced the letters individually, it’s time to start forming words with them. Look closely to how the words are spaced within themselves and from one another on the source document.Use the source document as a reference to better understand proper spacing within your writing.
Identify letters you struggle with and go back to practicing their individual elements while analyzing the source document.

"
"
Read the letters “s” and “f” carefully.,
Look for interchangeable letters.,
Notice spelling variations.",How to Read Old Handwriting2," In English, the letter “s” was often written as a backward “f."" In the middle of some words, you may see the modern-day symbol for “f” where an “s” should be. For example, the name “Massachusetts” could be written as “Maffachufetts.”Being mindful of this common character difference can help save a lot of time and patience when reading old handwriting.

, Be aware that some letters were often interchanged in old documents and are not necessarily misspellings.


For example, in English the letter “i” was often changed to “y,” so that the word “mine” can be seen as “myne.”The letters “u” and “v” were frequently interchanged in English as well. For example, the word “ever” could be written as “euer,” or the word “unto” could be seen as “vnto.”
“J” was often interchanged in English with “i,” so that the name “James” may be appear as “Iames.”, Words in old documents were often spelled phonetically, or how they sounded in the local dialect.English spelling was not standardized until the 18th century, so understanding the context of a document may be difficult for modern-day readers. Try saying the word out loud and refer to your dictionary when you come across these spelling variations.

"
"
Understand space-saving characters.,
Look for “th” replacements.,
Look for symbols.",How to Read Old Handwriting3," Abbreviations, contractions, and symbols were often used to save time and space on the paper, which was a very expensive commodity.You will most likely come across shorthand references in your research.

, The letter “y” often stood in for the letters “th” in English documents. You may come across the word “ye” in a document, which could be an abbreviation for the word “the.”

, Signs and symbols were often used to signify a certain word, and you will most likely run across one or two in your research.The symbol “@” can be used to replace the word “per.”If you come across “@ week,” for example, that will most likely mean “per week.”
In English, a short, wavy line that appears over a letter or group of letters is called a tittle. This symbol indicates the exclusion of the letter “m” or “n” or the omission of the suffix “tion.”A very common symbol is “&,” commonly known as the ampersand, and is used to indicate the word “and.” Pay attention to this symbol as it frequently has personal variations and can change from author to author."
"
Transcribe the document.,
Read the document aloud.,
Transcribe abbreviations.,
Trace the letters.,
Take your time.",How to Read Old Handwriting4," Review each word and letter of the document and write down the words, letters, and abbreviations that you recognize on a separate piece of paper. Leave a blank space for the words you don’t recognize.

, Hearing the text may help you to recognize unfamiliar words and can help place antiquated words in a modern context., Writing down an abbreviations key on a separate piece of paper is a great way to keep track of the abbreviations used in the document. It is also handy to refer back to while studying the document.

, If you are having a difficult time understanding the handwriting, try writing the words yourself. Place tracing paper over the photocopy of your document and trace each word with a pen. Creating the characters yourself and understanding the motion may help you understand the differences and the overall context of the primary source. , Be sure to analyze and review the document carefully and slowly, taking time to study each word and letter. You may miss the meaning if you zoom through the document, so be sure not to rush."

Find the author of the article.,
Find the title of the journal or magazine article.,
Include the name of the journal or magazine.,
On the same line, include the date of publication.,
Find the volume and issue number of the journal you're referencing.,
Include the exact page numbers.,
Add the location of the source.",How to Write a Source Card2," Like with a book, place the author’s name on the first line in the upper left-hand corner of the card, with the last name first. Let’s say our author’s name is Jo Ross. It will look like this:


Ross, Jo.

, The title should be at the top of the article. The title of the article we’re looking at is “Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats,” which you’ll add below the author’s name. Remember that the titles of journal articles should go in quotations, they should not be underlined like book titles..


Ross, Jo.
""Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats""

, If you’re working online, the journal title should be listed somewhere below the author in the database page or at the top or bottom of the journal article. If you’re working in print, the journal name should be on the front cover. Our journal is titled “The Sociology of Cats” — it should go under the article title and be underlined:


Ross, Jo.
""Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats""
The Sociology of Cats

, With a journal, the date could be a month and year or a day, month, and year. In this example, the article was published in February of 2002, so write the month and year, followed by a colon:


Ross, Jo.
""Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats""

The Sociology of Cats Feb. 2002:

, One piece of information you need to include with a journal article that you don’t need with a book is the volume and issue numbers. These should be located in the bibliographic information online, or at the front of the journal or in the header or footer in print. In this example, the volume number is 14 and the issue number is 2. Occasionally, journal articles won’t have these numbers.


Ross, Jo.
""Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats""

The Sociology of Cats Feb. 2002:
14(2)

, The page numbers tell your reader where in the journal the article can be found, which is why they are important to include on your source card. In this example, the article is located on pages 22-54. Add it below the volume and issue information:


Ross, Jo.
""Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats""

The Sociology of Cats Feb. 2002:
14(2)
22-44

, Finally, make sure to add the location of the source, whether you found it on a database, website, or in a print publication. In this example, the journal article was found in EBSCOhost on the Sociology Database:


Ross, Jo.
""Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats""

The Sociology of Cats Feb. 2002:
14(2)
22-44

Find the author of the website.,
Write the name of the particular page you wish to source.,
Include the title of the website.,
Add the year of publications.,
Be sure to include the date you accessed the website.,
Include the exact URL of the website.",How to Write a Source Card3," Sometimes the author of a website can be difficult to find. However, on good websites, the author should be under the title, at the bottom of the page, or on the “About Us” page. Write the name of the author on the upper left-hand corner of the notecard. IN this example, the author's name is Greg Haws, so the name is written as follows:


Haws, Greg.

, Establish the title of the particular page you sources your information from, which may be different from the main website. In this example, the specific page being referenced is “Cows Like to Moo”. Write this information beneath the author's name, and be sure to put quotation marks around it.


Haws, Greg.
""Cows Like to Moo""

, Now you’ll need the title of the website. In this example, the website is named “The Story of Cows”. Place this information beneath the specific page, and underline it.


Haws, Greg.
""Cows Like to Moo""
The Story of Cows

, Next, add the year of publication below the title of the website. The year should be at the top of the webpage, under the title or at the bottom of the webpage. If the article also has a month and date, include those too. In this example, the year is 2001.


Haws, Greg.
""Cows Like to Moo""
The Story of Cows
2001.

, In addition to the above-mentioned information, you’ll need to add the date on which you accessed the site. This information is important, as websites can change or disappear over time. In this example, the website was accessed on the 18th of June, 2014.


Haws, Greg.

Place your cards in alphabetical order.,
Order you cards with numbers.",How to Write a Source Card4," Once you’ve written your cards, you can organize them one of two ways. The easiest way is to alphabetize them by the authors’ last names, as that is how you will be organizing your reference page. Just put them in order in a box (or use a rubber band to keep them together), adding sticky notes where you change letters.

, The second way to organize is by the numbers in the right-hand corner, if you’re using that system. You can add sticky notes every tenth number to make it easier to look up information.

"
,How to Write a Source Card5,
"
Before you begin to write your story, find the tone and mood of your story.,
Research writing techniques and styles.,
Plan your characters' contributions.,
Develop a short summary of every scene that will take place until your climax.,
Create the climax itself in your head.,
Build up your reader's sense of what the characters are thinking.,
Draw emotion from characters and have them react differently.,
Don't be afraid to create interactions.,
Have changes/twists that leave your reader in awe, but don't go as far as to satisfy them.,
Create information gaps for particular characters.,
Review your user of adjectives and adverbs.,
Feel suspense yourself.,
Get feedback.",How to Write a Suspenseful Build‐Up in a Story," Will it be dark, deep, sad, grim, edgy, or something else? Once you have clearly defined the overall feel of it (which should be based on mood and tone), it helps to get into that way of thinking, somewhat like method acting, just not as dramatic. The easiest way to do this is through exploring music types that correlate with your overall feel. For example, if you are writing a very dark and suspenseful story, a good dark song to listen to is ""Mad World,"" performed by Gary Jules.;
, How do you want things to unfold in your suspenseful story? How can you make the causes and effects you want in your suspenseful story efficiently?

, You must fully understand how each character will develop and partake in your story, and how that relates to every other character and the story before understanding the climax itself. Make a list of your characters along with all of their intentions, how they will act, react, and end up at the end of your story (or at least to the climax). Study this intently as you will find it is very easy to create plot holes and collapse on your own work.

, Organize a numbered list of all of your scenes, with 1-2 sentences describing what happened in that scene and how everyone reacted and felt. Study this as well, and again make sure that everything makes perfect sense, unless you plan on having a mystery or hidden twist that explains it all (wherever that may be in the story is up to you).

, Use all the notes you've written so far. Will it be grim, sad, horrifying, etc.? Now you should understand the atmosphere of the climax and the tension among the characters.

, If you're writing in third person omniscient, it should be fairly easy to depict the thoughts and intentions of each character towards the reader. Simply creating the events that cause tension among characters or tension itself and providing characters' thoughts on the situations is enough to leave the reader aware of the suspense.

   

If you are writing in first person point of view, you may have to rely on more action-based reactions. For example, say the main character tries to kill another character. How does everyone comprehend the situation? You won't be able to display the thoughts of each character directly, which means you have a few options. You can have them react through dialogue or actions. Dialogue could range from talking to themselves, a friend, the main character himself, etc., while actions could be trying to call the police or attacking the main character. A third option is waiting to reveal one's thoughts until a later time, which may be more rewarding for the reader and create even more tension and suspense.

, An easy way of creating tension is to have varying emotional reactions. This will cause conflict that makes it more enticing and thrilling. Don't have everyone feel the same way as this can dampen a lot of nail-biting moments from the reader and end up causing less drama. To create emotion itself, describe it. Use many adjectives/adverbs that detail what people are feeling or how they act, such as ""gloomily, hopelessly, mournful, enraged, offended.""

, Having many connections in the storyline and interactions among the characters makes the story exciting, as the reader will continue to read so that they can find out how each character will react. Interactions that generally end with unexpected results tend to add more tension as well.


When writing suspense, you must know how to word sentences correctly in dialogue to create the result you were looking for. In easier terms, make conversation with your end goal of that scene in mind, manipulating things until what you wanted to occur occurred, and makes sense that it did.

, The whole idea behind suspense is to leave people lost for satisfaction, only to find it at the end or the climax. For every moment that something worthy or even just plainly positive happens, there should be an equal negative consequence that the readers are aware of. This can give readers more reason to keep reading whilst forging tension.


Some examples of awe-filled moments can be the death of a character (one of the most common ways to create tension/unsatisfaction in suspense stories), the return of a character, a sudden change in judgement in a character, a change in pace of the conflict, or events that make happy endings more and more unlikely.

, Earlier, you made a list about your characters and their feelings and intentions. You can edit this to have some people unaware of certain events. This is done very commonly in superhero shows, where someone very close to the superhero doesn't actually know that the person is in fact, a superhero. This can be extremely awarding for when the character actually does find out the information, but builds a lot of suspense as they may get closer to learning the information throughout the story.

, As you review your work, make sure everything you've written flows towards creating suspense. Don't make someone sad, and then have them go to somewhere lively and fun. It is very important to make sense. If someone is sad but must go somewhere lively or fun, make him sad, but composed, or simply able to do things despite the sadness. If one person feels one way about a certain thing, he/she should feel the same about other similar situations. Everything about each character should be understandable and in turn, relatable to your reader.

, When reading over scenes and lines of dialogue you created, you should also feel suspense. If you don't find yourself on the edge of your seat as you read, you may need to rework the piece.

, To get a better understanding, you can ask a friend or close person to read it over and give their thoughts. Take their advice and see if it helps. Have them read suspenseful parts to ensure that they feel the way they should. Don't be too surprised if they can't stop reading.

You don’t have to follow some love letter template or write poetry or sappy phrases unless you want to. The best thing you can do is be yourself in your letter. , Go somewhere private and shut the door. Try to remove as many distractions as possible, including noise, disruptive electronics and interruptions. Create an ambiance that inspires you with candlelight or music.


Maybe there is a song that reminds you of the person you love. Find that song and play it while you think.
You can also bring a picture of your love with you to look at.

, We all have moments where we feel very deeply about the ones we love. Conjure up that feeling—a moment when all your attention was focused on that one person, and you were completely immersed and lost in your love. Experience the physical and emotional feelings of that moment as deeply as you can. Be sure to jot down a description about your feelings and any words that come to mind to describe the way you feel.

, You fell in love with him or her for a reason. There was something about them that first attracted you and something that helped you fall in love and kept you there. They have special attributes, such as looks, personality, character, temperament, humor or strengths that you want them to know you appreciate. Tell him or her all the things you love about them and how you value who they are and what they do for you.


Think about what your significant other is to you? Your best friend? Your soul mate? Make a list of everything you appreciate and adore about your partner.
Now create sentences with your list. “I love how soft your hands feel in mine,” or “I love the way you look at me and let me know everything will be all right,” or perhaps, “Your smile and easy laughter can make my whole day.”
Don’t just focus on physical characteristics. This can make the letter feel shallow and incomplete. You don’t want to completely avoid physical attraction in your letter either, though, because then it can feel a little too platonic. Love letters are meant to be tastefully sensual and respectful—not necessarily erotic.

, You have probably shared many special moments with your lover. You have a history with your significant other that only you two share. The memories of those experiences enrich your relationship.


Think about the story of when you two first met or felt sparks fly. There was a moment in time when you knew you wanted to be with that person. Write down that story and everything you remember about it—from the clothing they were wearing to the place it happened and how nervous or confident you felt about approaching them.

, Your relationship has a past but it also has a future that you want to encourage in your love letter. If you’re apart, describe all the things you want to do together when you’re reunited. If you’re committed, discuss some goals, dreams and fantasies you have about your future life together. Write it all down.

, Many love letters have made their rounds from soldiers at the battlefront throughout history. It can give you some perspective to think about what you would say if there might not be a tomorrow. Make every word count, and don't be shy.

, Don’t worry so much about grammar and spelling at this point. The message is what matters, and once you get that down you can go over the letter and fix any errors. Your letter is a confession of sorts on how you feel, and right now you want to focus on being completely honest and open about how you feel and why.


Take your time and don’t rush. If this is the first love letter you have ever written, then keep that in mind. There is a learning curve for everything, so accept that you may have some difficulties or make mistakes.
Use your own voice to express how you feel. Don’t imitate the way someone else writes or speaks. You want this message to be uniquely yours and to reach your partner the way only you can. It must be sincere and reflect the real you on paper.
Keep your partner in mind as you write your letter as well as the level of your relationship. Declaring your love to someone for the first time will probably be a little different on paper than writing a letter to your wife of 20 years.
Remember to state your love somewhere in the letter. A simple ""I love you"" works just fine.

, Tell your beloved why you are writing the letter. You want to be clear that this is a love letter right away. Think about what led you to decide to write the letter. You can say something like, “I’ve been thinking a lot lately how much I love you, and I want you to know how much I cherish you.”Don’t insult your lover or depreciate yourself or your feelings in the letter. Be confident about how you feel and what you are saying to avoid confusion., This is where your memories, stories and all the things you appreciate about your partner will come in handy. Tell your lover what you love about them, why you love them, how they make you feel and remind them of a story that is unique to your relationship. Tell him or her how your life has changed for the better, and how your life would be incomplete without them in it.


The goal of the love letter is to express very deep feelings that you have a hard time conveying in person. Take this opportunity to say more than you usually say and to take it to a deeper level. Use the ideas you jotted down earlier to guide you.
If you don’t write poetry, consider including a poem from a favorite poet or a quote that expresses more of what you’re trying to say. Always give the writer credit to avoid looking like you tried to steal it and trick your partner into believing it was yours.
If you want to be cheesy, go ahead. Just be authentic, and if your partner loves you, he or she will love your letter too.

, Everything you are writing is probably going to be saved. Avoid bringing up negative things in the letter as much as possible. Don’t be critical or indecisive either. This is your chance to tell your love how great they make you feel and how awesome your life is with them in it, not to go over your mistakes or rehash bad history.A good way to keep your letter positive is to talk about how you feel right now. Yes, you want to go over those special stories about how you fell in love but you also want to be sure your partner knows that you still feel strongly for them or even more so.
Try something like, “Now, a decade later, I still get butterflies when you smile at me,” or ""I love you more now than I ever have before.""

, Talk about the future you hope to have together. Remind them how important your relationship is and how long you want it to last. Tell them your level of commitment, and if nothing will stand in the way of your love, faithfulness and devotion, let them know. Describe what forever means to you and what it looks like with your partner in it.

, You want to end your love letter positively. You can end with a statement that briefly describes how you feel about your love. You can write something like, “I hope to dream of you tonight,” or “I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”

, Give the person something pretty they can touch, feel, and, if you’re lucky, tuck into their pillow at night. It's best to write on paper that has either a simple (such as white), calming (for example, cream), or sensual (such as flesh-toned) color. Selecting high-quality paper will add a nice touch and show how much care went into writing your letter.


If you don’t have any stationary, a piece of plain or notebook paper will do fine as well. The message is definitely more important than the type of paper you write on.
You can make regular paper look old or even make your own paper if you want to do something fun.
Use either a black or brown ink to keep the writing grounded and classy-looking. Avoid “teacher colors” like blue, green, and red that will make it look like you’re marking up a homework assignment.

, Address the person as “beloved,” “dearest,” “beautiful,” “most cherished,” or, if appropriate, a pet name. If you are already in a romantic relationship, you can say “my” (for example, “To My Dearest ____”), but don’t do this if you’re using the letter to confess your feelings—it could come across as presumptuous and territorial. Instead, use something more detached like “To The Lovely ____,” for example.

, Date your love letter (month, day, year). This is a memento of your love that will be treasured for years to come. The date is important, and will help bring your love back to the moment he or she received the love letter from you. It is bound to be read over and over again, so be okay with some phrases from this time in your life that you put in the letter being quoted to you later.

, Use your draft letter to create your final letter. Make sure there aren’t any smears or marks on the paper and that your handwriting is legible. Penmanship is important here so take your time writing, and try to make each letter as neat as possible. You want your love to be able to read and enjoy looking at your love letter.

, This is your final goodbye. Suitable sign offs include “Yours,” “Yours Forever,” “XOXO,” “Kisses,” “All My Love,” and “Love Always.” If applicable, include a pet name, inside joke or even a reply to a long-unanswered question to make it more personal.


If you want to be a bit more romantic, try a simple but passionate farewell. ""With undying love"" or ""Forever yours"" can work well.

, You can include something special with the letter as an extra token of your love. This may be flower petals, a favorite teabag, even perfume or cologne sprayed on the paper. You can also trace a hand on the back of the letter or leave a lipstick kiss on the paper.

, Fold the letter with the text on the inside, and place it in an addressed envelope. You can choose an envelope that matches your stationary for a beautiful effect. If you want, you can make the envelope or even fold the note itself into an envelope.Alternatively, roll the letter up like a scroll and tie it closed with a piece of nice ribbon or string.
A romantic stamp, such as the Garden Bouquet stamp, can add a lovely embellishment to your envelope. If you want to, put the stamp upside down, which customarily means, ""I love you.""

, Mail your letter through Special Delivery if you really want to get your loved one’s attention. Surprise can enhance the message and make the experience more emotional and memorable for your significant other. You can also choose to hide the letter under a pillow, in a drawer or bring it in on a plate with dinner or breakfast.You may want to wait a little while before you send out your letter. After you have finished, put it away and check it before it is time to send it out. Look for errors and make sure there is nothing that you will regret later in there. Then send it out, and be prepared for a passionate response to your labor of love.

, Don’t make this a one-time event. Make a habit of writing love letters to the person you care about for birthdays, anniversaries, time spent apart, time spent together or no particular reason at all. The more you do, the easier love letters will be to write and the more meaningful they’ll become.

",How to Write a Postcard," Any great correspondence starts with something to write on. For the tourist ""wish you were here"" types of postcards, every gift shop at every resort everywhere in the world will have postcards.


Whether you're at Mt. Everest in Nepal or Thunder Mountain at Disney World, you'll find professionally-shot postcards that look great and will make your friends drool with envy.
Why wait? Sometimes you see a postcard that you just know will make somebody laugh. Get it!
Make a sport of it. Like the gnome in the French film Amelie, or the man who had a squirrel invade his home, sending postcards can be a game. There was a fellow who had a squirrel invade his house one summer. After two weeks of trying to catch it, he finally succeeded. He drove 20 miles (32 km) out of town, and released the squirrel. A few days later, he received a postcard from one ""Mr. Fuzzy."" Then another, then another, as the intrepid Mr. Fuzzy traveled the country. Several friends jumped into the game, and by fall he had received postcards from major cities around the world. You too can create your own “Mr. Fuzzy.” Make up an alias for yourself and send a friend or child postcards from all over, signed by your alias.

, Now that you have your prized possession in your hands, it's time to work on the details. A postcard's format is very straightforward.


Flip the postcard photo side down. The top right corner is generally where the stamp goes (there should be a box in the corner that is perfectly stamp-sized).
Postcards are usually split up so that the right side of the card has lines for you to write out the address you want the card to be sent to. On the left there should be a blank space in which you can write a message, doodle, or create a riddle that will lead the recipient on a cross-country scavenger hunt.

, This is optional but will give your recipient an idea of when you sent the postcard (and can also be a little experiment to see how long a postcard takes to get from Canberra, Australia to San Francisco, USA). You might be surprised at how long or short the postcard’s travel time is.

, Begin by addressing the person (or people) you are sending it to. A simple, “Dear John,” would work, but you can get as creative as you like. Try something like “To the man who once wore a 10 gallon (37.9 L) hat to an ice cream parlor” or “My dearest, Most darling, beloved Aunt Nancy.”

, The first rule of postcard writing is, there are no rules. Write as much or as little as you like. Don’t write at all but instead draw a picture depicting your favorite moment of your trip thus far. It really is up to you. Some people choose to write as much as possible, filling up the text area, then writing along the bottom, up the right hand side, upside down along the top, and on down the left side. Go wild so long as there is space to write your recipient’s address. Here are some ideas about what to write about:


Give your recipient an account of your favorite moment of the trip so far. Something along the lines of: Though this whole trip to Panama has been amazing, yesterday something happened that was truly crazy. I discovered I have a sloth sense. The girls and I trekked through the jungle to find this beautiful hidden beach, and on the way I spotted four different sloths. Each time one was near, I would stop walking and announce that there was a sloth around. I would look up, and sure enough, a sloth! Right above me!

Another idea is to give an account of a weird food you have tried: You won't believe this but two days ago I tried kangaroo tail, crocodile meat, and a green ant, all in the same day! The kangaroo tail was a bit greasy but the Crocodile tasted like--you guessed it!--chicken. But most surprising of all, the green ant tasted like a sour grape! The land down under sure is an interesting place!

You might consider closing with something like, “hope all is well” or “You would love it here!” so that your recipient doesn’t die of envy.

, Since formality is not a requirement for postcards, say goodbye like you were talking to them. When was the last time you said ""sincerely yours"" to somebody, face to face? Instead, there are the old standbys: ""Wish you were here!"" ""See you soon!"" ""LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!"" Or, you can sign off in a personalized way. Examples are “Love, your wandering granddaughter” or “Signed, a broad abroad” or something pun-y like that.

, Some cards will also have lines for you to write the address on. Write the recipient’s name(s) followed by their address (House or apartment number, street name, town, city, country, zip code.)


Don’t forget to add the country name! While you may not have to do that when sending snail mail within your own country, you will have to do that when you’re abroad!

, Before you can make the recipient green with jealousy (or red with embarrassment, if you are in Brazil and sending one of those kinds of postcards), you will need to put a stamp on it—up in the right hand corner. Make sure you put the right amount of postage to get it to its destination, find a post office station, and drop that little slice of cardboard love in the mail.


If you’re not sure how much postage it will take to get the postcard from one place to another, duck into the nearest post office and find out. Make sure to purchase international postage if its required.

Consider sending a gift.",How to Write a Thank You Letter to a Customer," An abundance of market research has found that almost all customer-centered messaging is nearly entirely ineffective if the customer's name is not spelled correctly. It's critically important to make sure that the spelling that a customer uses is what appears at the head of a customer thank-you letter.;
, Make it as specific as possible. Saying something as simple as ""thanks for your purchase"" is fine, but it's helpful to identify what the customer ordered and how it was delivered. This helps to orient the reader back into his or her unique relationship with your business.


This is your time to be as sincerely thankful as possible. Adding a few lines that reference a conversation you had with the customer is appropriate.
Do your best to avoid sounding rote, or making it seem like the same thank-you note is going out to a hundred people.

, A customer thank you letter is an appropriate time to ask some basic follow-up questions to make sure the customer feels that his or her needs are served. Good customer follow-up often keeps customers coming back and increases the bottom line of a business. You don't have to be too involved with this kind of follow-up in a thank you note, but being attentive to customer needs is a major part of serving the public.


Mention that you hope the customer is happy with his or her purchase, and that you're available if he or she has any questions or concerns.
Ask the customer whether there's anything you can do to increase his or her satisfaction.

, It's almost always helpful to present the company name, logo or other branding information in the customer thank you document. Again, this re-emphasizes visibility for the business.


If you're writing your thank-you note on a card, be sure to mention your business name.
If your thank-you note is written on letterhead, your company logo will be visible, so it's not necessary to mention your name in the letter.
If your thank-you note is in the form of an email, your company name and logo should appear beneath your signature.

, It should be in keeping with your established relationship with the customer and the personality you want to project for your business. For example, ""sincerely,"" which is sometimes overly formal, can be replaced with ""take care"" or a similarly informal sounding sign-off if appropriate. Other business-oriented sign-offs are also popular for making these documents sound personal.

, If at all possible, use your own signature to close the letter. Bigger businesses often struggle with the idea of how to make a form letter seem personal. Even a computer drafted signature is often better than a typed name, in that it makes the letter appear to have been sent personally.

, You're writing the letter to thank your customer for doing business with you, so it's no longer necessary to subject the person to advertising. Assume good rapport at this point. Make the customer feel like an insider.Phrases like ""we hope to do business with you again soon"" sound like tag lines; best to leave these out. Don't say something you wouldn't say to an acquaintance.
Don't include a product pitch, a mention of an upcoming sale, or anything else that could be construed as an ad.

, Even if you're mailing dozens of letters, it's better not to use a postage machine. That's a giveaway that this thank-you note is one of many, and it will make the customer feel less special. In fact, it may mean your thank-you note will end up in the junk mail pile.

, Again, the more personalized you make the thank-you note, the better it will be received. If you don't have time to address envelopes, have someone else do it. Even if you're not the person actually writing out the address, the customer will be impressed to see handwriting.

, Make sure your phone number and address are included in the correspondence, and give the customer warm encouragement to get in touch for any reason. If your customer does contact you, be ready to meet his or her needs promptly.

, Printing out a standard form letter is akin to sending your customer an advertisement flyer. Instead of making your customer feel special and appreciated, it might have the opposite effect and cause annoyance. Plan to write out thank-you notes individually in your own handwriting.


If you have too many thank-you notes to write to be able to write each one out by hand yourself, ask another employee to help you out. It really will be worth the time it takes to write out letters individually.
If it's impossible to write the notes by hand, you'll need to find a different way to personalize them. At the very least, the customer's name and your true signature should be included in each thank you letter.
In some cases it might be appropriate to write a thank-you email, rather than sending a handwritten note. This can be appropriate when you have an established personal relationship with the customer. The key is to make sure it's personalized and sincere. If there's any chance your email could be mistaken for an advertisement, send a handwritten note instead.

, Both thank-you cards and company stationery are appropriate for a business thank-you letter. If you have just a few notes to write, an elegant thank-you card, such as the kind you buy in a stationery shop, will make your customers feel that they are a top priority. Otherwise, use heavy-weight paper printed with your company's letterhead.


Avoid using regular printer paper for a thank-you letter.
Choose thank-you cards that would be appropriate to send in any business setting. If your business is quirky and fun, it's fine to use colorful cards that represent your company the way you want it to be represented. Avoid using cards with inappropriate or overly personal images or messages.

, If you want to go even further to express your appreciation, you can send a small gift along with your note. This is not at all necessary, but for special customers it might be just the right thing. The gift should be small and useful. It can be representative of the services offered by your business, or something unrelated to your business but professional in nature.Small gift ideas include bookmarks, magnets, candy, a t-shirt, or a gift certificate.
The gift should not exceed a $25 - $50 value. Some companies have ethics policies that actually disallow them from accepting expensive gifts.

Send it promptly.",How to Write a Thank You Letter," Begin your thank you letter by addressing the person in the way that feels most natural. In almost every situation, starting with ""Dear ,"" is appropriate. Whether the note is for your best friend, your teacher or your mom, this works. If you're looking for something a little more personal, try:


""Dearest __,""
""Hi, __,""
""My friend,""
""To my favorite _____,"";
, Thank you notes are usually short and to the point, so start by thanking the person right away. Be specific about what you're grateful for. Describing the gift a little will make it clear that you've thought about it and it's something you cherish.


""Thank you so much for the darling pair of leggings you gave to Leigh!""
""You are such a dear for coming to my opening night.""
""I am very grateful for your assistance with my senior project this semester.""
""Without you, I wouldn't be the student, or person, that I am today.""

, Even if you don't absolutely love the gift, think about the trouble and expense the person went to for your benefit. Show them that this effort, and the gift itself, is important to you. Try to be honest and sincere.


""She has been begging me for a pair of leggings lately! They fit her just right, and she has a red dress that matches them perfectly. They'll be put to good use this winter.""
""You are such a dear for coming to my opening night. It made me happy to see your bright smile in the audience. Knowing you were there helped calm my stage fright.""
""I am very grateful for your assistance with my senior project this semester. You have a lot of students depending on you, and I really appreciate your taking the time to give me so much individual attention.""
""You did not have to take the time to mentor and meet with me -- most people wouldn't -- but your passion and patience has left an impact on me that I will never wear out.

, Now that you've expressed your gratitude, it's nice to write another few lines that show you care about the person. Ask some questions, and share information about your life. This makes all the difference between a dashed-off note and an actual thank you letter, and the recipient will take even more pleasure in receiving your words. For example, you could write,


""It was fun to catch up with you at the party. How are things going with Bobby's soccer team? He has natural talent, that boy. Leigh has been asking about him every day. We can't wait to see you this Christmas.""
""Will you be returning to New York again soon? Next time, I want to take you to dinner at my favorite spot. It'll be nice to have a full-length conversation, rather than rushing to catch up backstage!""
""I wish you the best with your research this summer, and look forward to seeing you at the NSTA conference in the fall.""
""Best of luck with your new responsibilities and projects. I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to see what you do next, and to keep learning from your from afar.""

, To wrap things up nicely, let them know how much you appreciate their friendship and love. You don't even have to bring up the gift again. Just thank them for being them.


""Friends like you are the best part of this town, and I'm looking forward to the day we can sit down together and catch up.""
""Your support throughout my career shows just how incredible of a friend you are. Your warmth, generosity, and kindness mean the world to me.""
""You give the college a good name, and embody everything I love about my school. I hope I can one day pay it forward to students of my own.""
""Anytime you want to talk, collaborate, or share a cup of coffee, you know where to find me. A conversation with you is something I could never turn down.""

, Think about the nature of your relationship and choose the closing that seems most appropriate. If you can't decide, it's fine to just sign your name. Here are a few examples of popular closings:



To a loved one: Love, Much love, Hugs and Kisses, All my love, Yours,

To a friend: Cheers, Thanks again, Warmly, See you soon, Many thanks,

To a colleague: Sincerely, Gratefully yours, Respectfully yours, Best wishes

, Either a handwritten or typed letter is totally acceptable. A handwritten letter will have a slightly more personal look, but a typed letter is better if you're more comfortable that way. What matters is the effort you're making to craft a letter and send it, so don't worry too much about your choice here.


If you choose to handwrite it, use a pen with black or blue ink. Write in either print or cursive, as long as your writing is legible.
If you choose to type it, use a font that's easy to read, like Times New Roman or Arial. This is especially necessary if you're writing a thank you letter to a professional colleague., While dashing off a note on a torn piece of scrap paper demonstrates your interesting character, it's considered more polite to use a nice piece of stationary or a thank you card. If someone went to the trouble of giving you a gift, the nice thing to do is send them your letter in a format that shows you're sincerely grateful.If you go with stationary, it doesn't have to be fancy. Look for heavier-weight paper made with cotton or another high-quality material. It's fine to use stationary with a design or your initials.
Packs of thank you cards are sold in stationary shops and drug stores. Consider getting more than one so you'll have more cards on hand for next time.

, The style of your note will be a little different depending on who's receiving it. Keeping the nature of the gift in mind, think about what type of note would be most appropriate. No matter what, you want to leave the person receiving the note feeling that you're sincerely grateful.


For example, if you're sending a thank-you note to your boss, and the workplace setting is pretty formal, you might want to choose high-quality business stationary, type the letter and format it according to the standards for a professional business letter.
If the note is for a friend, you can show a little more personality. Write your note on a funny postcard, or make your own cool stationary.

, While sending a thank-you text message never quite has enough oomph to show how grateful you are, sometimes it's fine to send an email. This is especially true if you're not writing the note in thanks for a physical gift. For example, if your aunt lent an ear when you were upset over breaking up with your boyfriend, you might want to send her a thank-you email in gratitude for her patience and understanding.


However, if you need to thank someone for giving you an actual gift or for dedicating a significant amount of time toward helping you, it's better to send a real letter. People realize that it takes effort to write and mail a letter, and that extra time will be appreciated.
If you send an email, it should be as well composed and thoughtful as a regular letter would be. In fact, you might want to take even more time making sure it's well written, since you're not going to the trouble of sending it by snail mail.

, This is a very general rule that works pretty well in practice. A very thoughtful, expensive gift deserves a thoughtful, rather lengthy letter. A tiny gesture may be thanked with a casual, small gesture in return. Think about how much time, effort and money was put into the gift and match your letter's tone and length appropriately.For example, if someone bought you a $100 wedding present, in addition to flying to your wedding and taking time off work to attend, they deserve a full-blown thank you letter on nice paper or a big thank you card.
On the other hand, if you were the recipient of a $5 Secret Santa stocking stuffer, a short, quick note will do.

, Are you having trouble coming up with enough to fill a whole thank you card? If you bought the type of card that comes folded in half, you don't have to fill up the entire blank space. Instead, you can start on the right half or bottom half of the card and write a letter that fills just half the card. It looks more proper than trailing off and leaving a lot of black space, or super-sizing your handwriting to fill it all up.


Of course, take the above rule regarding the length of the letter into account. If the recipient deserves a two-page letter, you'd better match the length to the size of the gift and fill up the entire card.

, Try to send out your thank you letter within a few days (or weeks, at the latest) of receiving your gift. That way the person who gave it to you will know you received it and that you're very grateful. Waiting too long is rude, especially if the gift was sent in the mail. The person who sent it might wonder whether it ever arrived.


That said, it's never too late to send a thank you note. Even if you send it months later, out of the blue, it's better than never sending one at all. If you wait this long, though, make it a good, long letter!

Be your own toughest critic.It’s easy to fall in love with your baby.",How to Write an Epistolary Narrative," You must develop a “narrative arc” before you start thinking about writing the letters in your story. In the simplest terms, a narrative arc should transition from exposition to rising action to resolution. If you mapped the tension of a story on a line graph, it would rise gradually, then climax at a sharp peak, then drop back down as the situation resolves.;
, Once your reader understands these three elements of your story, they will be able to follow the twists and turns of the plot when it gets more complicated.


Characters: Who is the main character, and who are the most important secondary characters? Is there an antagonist? Who is writing the letters and who is receiving them?
Setting: Where and when does this story take place? Paint a clear picture for the reader. “When” a story takes place might even refer to where the protagonist is in his or her life. For example — is your main character an adult reading old diary entries from childhood? A child writing letters to her future self?
Mood: The reader wants to know what kind of story they’re reading. Comedies should be light-hearted from the beginning. If your main character is a tortured hero, you should hint at the angst from the beginning.

, If your story doesn't have conflict in it, your readers won't care enough to keep reading. Conflict falls into three categories: internal, external, and situational. Most good stories will have a combination, if not all, of them.


Internal conflict is the protagonist's struggle with himself: regretting past mistakes, struggling with insecurities, grappling with important decisions. Judy Bloom's books are excellent explorations of internal conflict.External conflict is the protagonist's struggle with an antagonist, whether another person (Edmund in Shakespeare's King Lear ) or an entire societal system (George Orwell's 1984).
Situational conflict arises from circumstances that get in the protagonist's way. For example: your protagonist is rushing home to apologize to his mother before she dies. But he gets locked out of his apartment without his luggage, and then the taxi gets stuck in traffic. When he gets to the airport, the flight is delayed.

, When your readers are on the edge of their seats, have your protagonist face his central, most important conflict head on. Ideally, he will face both internal and external conflict in the moment.


For example, say your protagonist confronts the school bully in your climax. The bully is the external conflict. But the main character’s insecurity and lack of confidence in the internal conflict. He will have to face both obstacles in the climax.

, After the climax, give the readers “falling action.” This is a gentle return from the tensest moment in the story to a place where the reader imagines the character will spend the rest of his life. Note that this doesn’t always have to be a happy ending, though.


In a happy or comic ending, the main character ends up happier than he’s ever been before. Most children’s stories have happy endings — Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, for example.
In a tragic resolution, though, the main character might lose everything. Hamlet, for example, overcomes his obstacles only to die at the end of Shakespeare’s play., This is especially common in mysteries or thrillers, in which the person who solved the mystery might explain how they did so. Even if you’re writing a different kind of story, you may need to explain how things resolved before giving the reader your final ending. For example, if your protagonist dies in the climactic scene, what happens to his children? How do the relationships around him go forward?

, There's no single formula to writing an epistolary narrative. Some novels, like Bram Stoker's Dracula, are written entirely as letters.Others, like Orson Scott Card's Ender's Shadow Saga, start chapters with letters, then go back to traditional narration. But whether you want a ten-page story or a 250-page novel, don't feel pressured to tell the whole story through letters. Especially if you are just starting out as a writer, it will be easier to combine the letters with traditional narration.


Decide how much of the story you want to tell through letters.

, In this novel, all of the letters are written by the protagonist (main character), a teenaged boy named Charlie. You can also choose to present multiple voices through the letters, as Stoker does in Dracula. Each of the main characters in this novel gets their own chapters to speak — Jonathan Harker, Mina Murray, Dr. Seward, and Lucy Westenra., In Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary, all the letters take the form of diary entries. Dracula mixes diary entries with letters written between characters and newspaper clippings. If you are new to the form, you may find it easier to choose a single recipient for all the letters. This will allow you to really develop the relationship — whether the letters are written to a person or as diary entries to oneself. If you're feeling adventurous, though, you can play with a combination of different recipients.

, When we write our thoughts down, we organize our thoughts and say what we really mean. It's likely that a letter to a friend (or enemy) will be more articulate and truthful than a real-time conversation. Use these letters to develop the speaker's voice and personality completely. Show us how their mind works. Think about how the writer feels about the person he's writing to, and pour the truth of those emotions into the letters.Don’t let the writer forget about the person reading the letter. If letters start sounding like diary entries, the audience won’t enjoy reading them.

, As the action begins rising and the conflicts start piling up, your characters likely won’t have as much time to write as they used to. It’s just not realistic to sit down and write a letter to your best friend about an alien attack on the day it happens!


After major events, allow a little time to pass before you date the letters that address them. Have the writer speak of them in the appropriate tense: “Sorry I haven’t e-mailed in a few days. My sister’s been sick, and she’s in the hospital again. The doctors say she can go home next week, but I’m still so scared.”

, Even with something as simple as a diary entry, you have options to choose from. For example, a younger character might choose to begin every diary entry with “Dear Diary,” or even give the diary a name to make it feel more personal. An older character might just put the date at the top of the page and start writing.


If you’re writing letters, you don’t have to format them like you would proper letters in real life. The reader might not enjoy seeing the return address listed on every letter.

, The outline doesn’t need extensive details, but sketch out the main points of the story. This will help you keep track of what you’re building toward as you’re actually writing the story.


When does the initial conflict that sets the plot into motion occur? Usually, it happens at the end of the exposition, and kicks off the rising action.
What conflicts come into play during your rising action? Each conflict should raise the stakes and the tension, building toward the climactic scene.
What information do you want to include in your denouement? Anticipate the questions the reader will have about loose ends that need to be tied up.

, Don’t worry about making mistakes in your first draft: don’t check for spelling errors, and don’t correct your grammar. When you first start writing your draft, you want to focus on getting the story right.It’s about developing your characters and building tension — the things that will make your reader emotionally invest in your story. Use your outline to remind you of how your plot needs to progress.

, But luckily, you don’t have to show it to anyone until you’re ready to. This first draft is for your eyes only. It’s where you’re playing with different ideas and working out how to get from point A to point B in the plot. Instead of getting hung up on how your draft isn’t polished yet, try to enjoy the process. Focus on your accomplishments. Think of how good it will feel when you finally nail this scene!

, Don’t feel alone! Every writer comes across writer’s block at some point or another.If even your outline isn’t helping you move past it, don’t fret. The only thing you can do is keep writing. Remember that your first draft will be heavily revised before you finish your story. You can delete as many terrible versions of a scene as you want!


It may help to put this story aside for a while and write your way through other prompts. You don’t want to start another large project that might lead you to abandon this one. But free-writing about a fond memory or something interesting you say today will help get your hand moving. When you’re ready, you can come back to this story.

, Nobody writes a perfect story on the first try. A good writer will produce several drafts of the story. Give yourself time between drafts instead of writing and revising all at once. A little bit of time will give you distance and perspective. You’ll be able to see where you story is working well and where it needs more work.

, When you write something, you have every right to be proud of it and love it. But while you’re revising, you have to be cold to your own work and look ruthlessly for its flaws. Imagine you’re a reader seeing this work for the first time.


Do sections of the story drag? Shorten them!
Are some transitions unreasonable? For example, is it unrealistic for the love interest to fall in love with the main character as soon as she breaks up with her boyfriend? If not, do the work of ironing out those transitions.
Have you used the strongest language wherever possible? Read the whole draft aloud and look for sentences that sound awkward or weak. Focus on strengthening them.

Don't rest too long on your laurels and keep writing.",How to Write Articles Like a Professional," Read hundreds of articles and opinions until you get a real 'feel' of the subject. Experience your own vague views crystallizing into a strongly-felt opinion.;
, It doesn't matter what the subject is - politics, religion, environment, business. Just scribble some notes on what you feel about the subject. Then stand back and read them and see if they're both factual and rational.

, There are several ways to do this. Some people start at the beginning; others write the 'meaty' middle parts before they bother with the 'intro' or 'conclusion'. If you begin with the intro, it can give you a sense of 'flow' and a good intro always gives you a mental boost. But some people may feel so pressured to write a great intro that if it doesn't meet their expectations, they lose the inclination to continue. One more way is to imagine yourself discussing the subject with a friend who knows very little about it. Keep in mind, having a 'conversational' writing style shouldn't mean you should start with 'Hey, did you hear about the latest controversy over (anything)? I mean, that really sucks, what?' This is okay for a blog, but an editor would never let something like this pass. Ever.

, It's easier to write huge essay-type articles than it is to write crisp, concise copy because the latter forces you to be more expressive and convey your thoughts in fewer words.

, Leave him or her with something useful. A simple insight into a complicated issue. Another perspective to a commonly debated topic. Tips for improving the quality of their lives. Sprinkle a bit of wordplay and add a slice of humor. Stay away from cliches like 'At the end of the day...' or 'a wait and watch approach'. And please, don't have 'favourite' words or phrases that you keep smiting your readers with, such as 'a 110 per cent' or 'basically'. People hate that.

, Then if needed, read again and rewrite, this time, in a slower and more deliberate manner. Writing on a computer can tend to create more mistakes than when writing on paper for some people, so take a printout of your copy and read it sometimes.

, Try to spot obvious errors in other people's articles and make a mental note to stay away from those mistakes. Eventually, you'll develop a writing style all your own. Focus on refining and fine-tuning that style, because that's how all artists work. All the very best!

Keep your letter brief.",How to Write an Investor Proposal Letter," The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows small companies to issue securities under Regulation D. This saves the small company the sometimes prohibitive expense of registering with the SEC; however, issuing securities under this regulation requires that the issuer closely follow a set of rules in their investor solicitations activities and publications. The specific rules depend on whether the issuance is made as private fundraising or as a general solicitation., In general, investment solicitations are required to contain specific information, such as the securities' initial sale prices, the deal terms, the intended use of the funds, and financial statements for the issuer. Private fundraising issuances must also inform investors that they are buying restricted securities and that they cannot be resold for six months after the initial purchase.Businesses issuing through a general solicitation must publicly state they have filed SEC Form D and have followed regulations for advertising a 506(c) offering., Investors in these types of securities offerings must be ""accredited investors."" These investors are those who understand financial markets and can be deemed responsible for their investment decisions. Specifically, these are people who earn over $200,000 per year (or $300,000 when combined with their spouse) or are worth over $1 million. Alternately, other businesses, institutions, partnerships, and nonprofits may qualify. The important thing is that the issuer takes time to ensure that their investors are accredited investors before accepting their investments.Private fundraising offerings may also include up to 35 non-accredited individuals, provided they have a close, personal relationship with the issuer., During the offering process, you will have to register with your state's securities regulatory body. This agency may require additional information be present in your investor solicitation or letter or impose additional restrictions on the number or required qualifications of investors. Check with this agency in your state before moving forward., An executive summary should be a printed version of your elevator pitch for your business and provide the basis for the introductory paragraph of your investor proposal letter.Make sure your executive summary provides the problem your business can solve, as well as how you intend to solve it.
Your executive summary should indicate the progress you have already made professionally, or the research you have conducted regarding the demographics you will market to, as well as your potential for success.
Your summary should include any existing successes you have experienced in your field as well as what makes you qualified to pursue further profits in the industry.

, An important part of your investment proposal letter is an explanation of who you are and why you are well qualified to receive an investment to expand or develop your business.Include any achievements you have in your field to demonstrate your understanding of what the industry requires.
List your experience managing employees in the industry to demonstrate your ability to successfully manage a team in pursuit of your business goals.

, While forming the introduction of your investment proposal letter you will need to convey your level of expertise in the relevant industry.Briefly discuss your experience in the industry as reasoning for your expertise.
Avoid using industry-specific jargon, as investors may not be well-versed in the specifics of your industry.

, If your business involves people other than yourself, you should include them in your investment pitch. Investors tend to fund people as much or even more than ideas, so giving the name and a brief description of the leadership team you have on board can give investors increased reason to provide you with funding.Explain why your leadership team is uniquely qualified to excel in the industry of your choosing. You can do so by describing their experience, talents, or educational backgrounds.
Include any advisors that you utilize that are outside the leadership team you have appointed but that may lend credibility to your endeavor.
Securities laws require certain disclosures to protect potential investors as well as offerer. The issuer must comply or they will be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

, In some cases, federal or state regulatory agencies may require that an issuer create and distribute an offering circular for a private placement. The circular is essentially a summary of the full investment prospectus and hits all of the major highlights of the longer document. It is generally designed to drum up interest in a new issue.This circular is required for ""private placement"" offerings, which are those not registered with the SEC or issued under Regulation D., Investors like to work with concrete numbers, so provide them with specific amounts of money that you will need in order to achieve specific objectives. If you are unable to provide exact figures, include educated predictions based on your existing experiences.The ""use of funds"" section of an investment prospectus is a legally-required section that shows investors what their money will be used for. Be sure to provide them with a solid idea of how much money will be required to accomplish the goals you wish to achieve.
Explain what the exact results of the money invested will be and why you require the level of funding that you do.

, The most important element of your plan to investors is how they will see a return on their investment. Provide them with clear objectives and use financial pro forma projections to show expected returns after the investment. However, be sure to mention that these are subject to specific disclosures and caveats.You cannot provide a guaranteed or estimated return unless investors is receiving a bond or preferred stock.
Provide specifics about what investors will receive in return for their funding. Will they receive a percentage of company ownership? Will they receive a share of the profits? Be clear about what the return on their investment will be.
Make sure the return is valuable enough to warrant the investment and accept the possibility of turning a loss.

, Investors will want to know how their money is being used throughout your plan, so provide them with exact figures regarding what you intend to use the money for in order to establish confidence in those considering an investment.Provide details on funding you will use for recruitment, marketing or operations.
Identify project milestones that can be reached through varied levels of external funding.
Remember that investors are as interested and concerned in your business plan as they are in the business itself. If it appears that you are disorganized or ill-prepared, most investors will be reluctant to invest in even a great business idea.

, Collateral is something you own that you can leverage in exchange for investor funding. Collateral provides investors something they can receive in the event your business is not financially successful in the long run. However, this tactic only applies to debt and not always necessary in that case. Offering assets as collateral reduces future flexibility for financing.Collateral can be anything that you own and are willing to put up against the value of your business. Things like houses offer a large amount of collateral and can give investors the incentive to provide funding to your business.
If you do not provide any kind of collateral your proposal will need to provide an even stronger plan for returning on investments than otherwise, as investors will stand to lose even more if your business does not succeed.
Remember that you will have to turn over the collateral you put up in the event your business is not a success, so it is not recommended that you anything you can’t do without as collateral.

, While it may be tempting to request enough money to grow your business into a Fortune 500 company, typically the prudent thing to do is to request only enough to fund the next phase of your business plan.Investors will not be looking for an extremely long term turnaround on their funding. Instead provide relatively short term plans for their money and how they can receive returns.
By “thinking lean” in terms of your investment requirements you will demonstrate an understanding of the market and a business savvy that may make investors more likely to pitch in.
That said, sometimes the market overvalues a new company or idea. If you think your company can take advantage of this expectation, consider taking as much money as possible with to gain capital with a low outlay of equity.

, While you may believe your business is going to take off and earn your investors a lot of money, you need to be upfront about the risks involved in the investment. You may be tempted to downplay these risks, but legally you need to provide potential investors with enough information to make an informed decision about whether or not this is a good investment. You may wish to work with a lawyer to ensure you disclose enough information to protect you from liability if the investor loses their money.Risk disclosure may include things like location of the business (for instance, if your business is located down the street from a competitor), or risks related to key personnel (such as if the company is overly dependent on the ideas of a single person — think Steve Jobs).
There are specific state and federal rules that require the disclosure of certain information. Consider this the bare minimum, and note that it may not protect you from a lawsuit down the line if an investor loses money. Be as upfront as possible about the risks involved.
Failure to make proper disclosures can have serious consequences, including facing civil and criminal charges.

, After you have sent out your investment proposal letters, wait a week or two and send out thank you notes to those you asked to invest. This demonstrates proper business etiquette as well as keeping your ideas fresh in the minds of investors.The process of gaining investors can be long, so demonstrating your courtesy may be one of the things that differentiates you from other prospects.
Even if an investor declines to participate, establishing a relationship with them can be beneficial for future investments or guidance on receiving investments from others.

, Depending on the size of the investment that you have requested, a prospective investor may need to take some time to weigh the information you have provided them. It is important that you not rush an investor or demand an early decision, as rushed investors tend not to risk their money.Some investors wait to see how other investors respond to your pitch in order for them to proceed. These investors will wait until the first few people pitch in before making an investment of their own.
Prepare yourself for a series of “maybe” responses as investors weigh their options and their possibilities for return on an investment to your business.

, While an investment proposal letter includes a significant amount of information, it should actually be less than a page long. Refine your letter by writing it multiple times and revising the information you choose to include. However, if the proposal is sent to multiple prospects, effectively making a private solicitation subject to investment regulations, the proposal letter would be better characterized as a offering document or circular transmittal letter.


The first paragraph should establish your credibility within the industry as well as the other members of your team as assets that can aid in your success.
Your second paragraph should lay out your plan to use the funding and what each investors can provide to the business.
The third paragraph should lay out your financial needs as well as the possibilities for return on investments and risks involved.

Edit and revise your work.",How to Write an Interesting Article," The first step to writing any article is to research your topic. Whether you have been assigned a topic or you are choosing it for yourself, you need to find out everything there is to know about your topic.


The right kind of research for you will depend upon the kind of article you are writing, For example, if you are writing a news article, you will probably want to get out there and interview people who are related to the story. If you are writing about fitness trends, however, you may be able to do all of your research online.
When doing research, be sure to consult reliable sources. Look for academic articles, published books, and websites that are maintained by reputable organizations. Avoid personal blogs, forums, and promotional material whenever possible.Research and writing will both be much easier if you stay up to date about the topics that you write about, Even when you aren't planning to write an article, read up on industry trends and news. This knowledge will make you more intuitive to the needs and wants of your reader when it's time to choose your next topic.;
, When you begin to plan out an article, it's absolutely critical that you think about who will be reading it. Your audience will determine what kind of questions you should be addressing and what kind of language you should be using to answer them, so you can't skip this step!Think about how much your audience already knows about the topic. If it's geared towards novices, you will need to walk them through the material step by step and provide lots of background information. If it's geared towards people who are knowledgeable about the field, you will need to provide a more in-depth analysis and maybe utilize some industry jargon.
If you know exactly who your audience is, you can make your writing serve a purpose. Always aim to solve a specific problem that your audience is experiencing with each article.

, You may think that the topic you have to write about is boring and that there's simply no way to write an interesting article about it, but that's not true! You can find an interesting way of approaching any subject if you simply ask the right questions about it.Take a moment to brainstorm questions that you have about your topic. For example, if your topic is thunderstorms, you may be wondering what locations have the most thunderstorms, why some places have more thunderstorms than other places, and what kind of damage a thunderstorm can cause. These are all great places to start for your article.
Make sure the questions you're asking are interesting to other people, not just you. Try typing your keywords into major search engines to find out what people are asking about your topic on social media or forums. If people want to know about something, they will find your article interesting.

, In order to make your article interesting, it's important that it be unique.You should aim to provide your audience with information that they can't get anywhere else whenever possible.Even if you know everything there is to know about your topic, it's still important to do research so that you know what else has been published on your topic. If you write an article that repeats information that is available in another article (even if this was not your intention) it will not be as interesting.
If you can't come up with a completely new topic, try digging a little deeper into topics that have already been covered by others. Look for questions that the other articles failed to answer or angles that they didn't cover and make these the focus of your article., The voice of your article will depend on many different factors, including your topic and whether you are writing on behalf of a company or yourself. No matter what kind of article you are writing, however, it's important that you use a personable voice that sounds like a human, rather than a robot.If you are writing for a company, they probably have a manual that outlines what kind of voice they want you to use in your articles. If you ever have any questions about what is appropriate for your article, be sure to ask your editor or supervisor.
While this isn't appropriate for every kind of article, using the first person pronouns ""I,"" ""me,"" and ""my"" can help your writing sound much more personable. Avoid using the first person plural pronouns ""we,"" ""our,"" and ""us,"" even if you're trying to write on behalf of an entire company. This does not sound nearly as personal.If it's appropriate for your article, express emotions and opinions. Readers will appreciate the sincerity that this brings to your writing.
If it is appropriate for your industry, consider telling a joke or making a reference to a current event. This will help your reader connect with you., When writing your article, be sure to think about whether you have answered all of the main questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how. An article that leaves one or more of these questions unanswered will not seem complete.You may find it helpful to write an outline to help you keep track of the answers to these various questions. Whether you do this or not, it is a good idea to confirm that you have thoroughly answered each question during the editing process.
Keep in mind that some of the questions will require more elaboration than others, depending on your topic. For example, if you are writing an article about cooking, you will probably devote the most space to discussing how to prepare the meal and what ingredients are needed.

, To make your writing as interesting as possible, use language that allows readers to come to their own conclusions, rather than simply stating the conclusion for them. This will help readers feel as if they are experiencing the situation you are describing.For example, if you are writing an article about your favorite travel destination, consider describing the white sand, the sparkling blue water, and the warm sun instead of just saying that the beach is beautiful.
This technique works better for some topics than for others, so don't feel that you can never tell. For example, technical articles probably require more telling than showing.

, People love to read a good story, so try to incorporate one into your article if you can. Even if you can't think of a way to tell a complete story, you can incorporate storytelling techniques into your article to make it more interesting.Foreshadowing can add interest to your story. Consider giving your readers hints about what is to come in the title or opening sentences of your article. For example, if you are writing an article about a new business that opened in your town, you might foreshadow information about a major setback that occurred along the way by saying something like, ""The owner never anticipated that she would face as many obstacles as she did.""
Readers will get hooked faster if you start your article in the middle of the action, rather than by providing background information right away. Try to use suspense to keep them guessing about what will happen next whenever you can.Most great stories have some kind of conflict, so make sure this comes through in your writing. For example, if you are writing about a new apartment complex that is being built, it's much more interesting to include opinions from people who are both for and against the project than to simply state that the project is moving forward., To help readers understand the importance of the information you are providing, it helps to be as specific as possible. This means providing hard data and concrete examples to support your writing whenever possible.For example, if you are writing an article about the prevalence of a disease, it would be helpful to include specific figures regarding how many people have been infected, the mortality rate, and how these numbers have changed over time.
Even if your article does not lend itself to statistics, you can engage readers by providing specific examples of the impact of a certain situation. For example, if you are writing an article about dog training, you might include specific information about unwanted behaviors that are common in dogs who have not been trained.

, Whether your article is published online or in print, readers will decide whether or not they want to read it based on its title. On average, only 25% of people who read the title of an article actually start reading the article, but a good title can improve your odds.Make sure it matches the article content. Readers will not appreciate it if they start reading your article because they thought it would be about one topic, only to find out that it's about something else entirely.
Make sure it is easily understandable and unambiguous. Avoid using words that have multiple meanings or could be misunderstood. Keep in mind that readers will not spend much time trying to decipher your title.
Make it as specific as possible. Instead of writing ""How to Decorate a Room,"" consider something like ""How to Decorate Your Living Room Like a Professional for $200.""

, Readers do not like to stare at a long block of text, so be sure to break it up to make your content seem more manageable. Most readers will skim an article rather than reading it in its entirety, so keep this in mind when formatting your work.Readers typically find numbered or bullet pointed lists very easy to read. If you can't make a list, consider breaking up your article into different sections using subtitles.
Make sure readers can find the answers they are looking for quickly. This may mean bolding the most important information or making sure your subtitles are very specific., There is no hard and fast rule for choosing the best length for your article, but it should be long enough to provide all of the important facts, but short enough that your audience does not get bored before finishing it. When deciding how long your article should be, think about who your reader is, how much information they will want, and where your article will be published.Make sure you have completely addressed your topic. If there are questions that have been left unanswered, your article is too short.
Make sure you are not repeating yourself or writing sentences that don't add any important information to your article. If you are, you need to cut back.

, Your article should be extremely easy for your reader to understand. In order to achieve this, use simple language and short sentences. This doesn't mean you can't be descriptive, but never sacrifice the clarity of your sentence for flowery language.Be as specific as possible. When you talk in general terms, you run the risk of losing clarity. It helps to offer examples and descriptions whenever possible. For example, instead of writing, ""There are a lot of different birds in this area,"" consider writing something like, ""Birdwatchers come to this area to admire the many different species that live here, including robins, blue jays, cardinals, and doves.""
When editing your work, be on the lookout for words that are not adding any additional information and get rid of them. For example, if you wrote, ""People love this city for the simple reason that it has so much to offer,"" you can change it to ""People love this city because it has so much to offer"" without losing any of the meaning of the sentence.
Don't feel like you need to use long or fancy words to sound interesting. This kind of language can make your writing more difficult to understand, so stick with the simpler word when in doubt.
It's a good idea to think about your reader when determining how complex your language should be. If you are writing for a general audience, try to write at or near a 9th grade reading level. If you are writing for a more specialized audience, adjust the complexity of your writing accordingly. If you're not sure what reading level your article is, you can try running it through one of many free online reading level calculators., People enjoy reading articles that contain more than just text. Look for ways that you can incorporate images or graphics into your article. The additional media should enhance your article and make it easier for people to understand the information you are presenting to them, so make sure they are clear and relevant.Add photos that will help your reader understand what you are talking about in your article.
If you are talking about numbers, consider adding a chart or graph to illustrate the data. This will make it much easier for readers to absorb.
People also find videos very helpful, so incorporate one into your article if you think it is relevant.

, No matter what you are writing, it's always a good idea to write a rough draft, edit your work, and then write your final draft. Some people find it helpful to start with an outline before they begin writing the first draft as well. Whatever process works best for you is fine as long as you edit for grammar, spelling, and style.


Some people find it helpful to just write without worrying about spelling or grammar for their first draft. This is fine, as long as you are very thorough in your editing process and correct any errors you may have made.
Read through your article very slowly so you will be more likely to catch typos and misused words.
Be on the lookout for any sentence that seems too long or clunky. If it sounds a little confusing to you, chances are it will sound very confusing to your audience.
If possible, have someone else read over your work and give you feedback. It's much easier for someone who did not write the article to pick up on potentially confusing verbiage.
Once you have self-edited your work or had someone else edit it for you, write your final draft, making sure to copy edit it for errors one last time before submitting.

Focus on skills and attributes that relate to the position.,

Read the letter out loud.,
Check that the tone and voice matches the recommender.,
Proofread the letter for grammatical errors.,
Get the letter signed by the recommender.",How to Write Your Own Letter of Recommendation," There are two different types of recommendation letters, a field specific recommendation letter and a character recommendation letter. In general, both types have a similar structure. But determining which type of letter you are writing will help you get a better sense of the voice and content of the letter.A field specific letter will be written from the perspective of someone in your field, such as your manager at work or your professor at school. If you are using the letter of recommendation to apply for a job, you will usually need a field specific letter.
A character letter will be written from someone outside of your field, acting as a testimony of your character. This type of letter is often written by a supervisor at an internship, a volunteer supervisor, or a professor outside of your field. Many academic program applications require two to three field specific letters and one character type letter.;
, Think about the types of skills and attributes required in the job description or as part of being a good student at a university. Make a list of skills and attributes that you possess that connect to the position. Focus on specific skills and attributes you have that feel relevant and important.For example, if you are applying for a position at a non-profit organization, you may list skills and attributes like, “a good multi-tasker, able to be client facing, a confident public speaker, a good communicator, and a strong writer.”
If you are applying for school, you may list skills and attributes like, “able to meet deadlines, an active member of the community, a strong writer and reader, and a good student with a high GPA.”

, You should also focus on two to three accomplishments that relate to the position you are applying for with the letter. This could be a student award you won or a job accomplishment that you are proud of. Pick at least one accomplishment that relates to your experience with the recommender. This way, you can discuss it in your letter from their perspective and use it as evidence of your qualifications.For example, if you are writing the letter on behalf of your professor, you may list an A+ paper you wrote in their class or a project that you completed in their course.
If you are writing the letter on behalf of your employer, you may list a sales target you hit as their employee or a key client that you landed for the recommender’s company.

, Think about one scenario or situation illustrates your strengths as an applicant. Make sure the scenario involves the person “writing” the letter, such as your professor or your employee. You can then use this scenarios or situation as an example of your qualifications as an applicant.The scenario should be short and to the point. You should be able to summarize it in one to two sentences.
For example, you may focus on a scenario where you went above and beyond expectations for an assignment, resulting in a high grade. Or you may choose a situation where you won over a client by doing detailed research for a contract.

, Letters of recommendation are official documents and should start with a formal address, such as “Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. .” If possible, the letter should be written on organizational letterhead. Your recommender may need to print the letter out for you on official letterhead once the letter is complete.Most letters of recommendation are no longer than one page, with one paragraph for an opening, two body paragraphs, and a short ending paragraph.
The paragraphs in the letter should be flush left and written with 11 point or 12 point font.

, Begin the letter by stating the purpose of the letter and how the recommender knows you. Stating the recommender’s relationship to you up front will put the letter in context and show the reader that the recommender is speaking from a place of knowledge and experience.For example, you may begin with, “It is my pleasure to recommend for admission to your graduate program. I have known for nearly three years, during which time she was my undergraduate student as well as my teaching assistant for a leading social change course.”
Or, if you are writing the letter for a job application, you may start with, “It’s my absolute pleasure to recommend for with . and I worked together at for . I thoroughly enjoyed working with and viewed as a valuable employee in my team.”

, Next, make sure you include a paragraph that focuses on your skills and attributes, as well as how they relate to the position you are applying for. Include skills or traits that also show your relationship to the recommender. Use one to two examples to support these skills and attributes.For example, you may write, “knowledge of social justice issues and expertise in leading social change was a huge advantage during the class. put this skillset to work in order to assist students with their questions and guide class discussion. was an invaluable resource for students during the class.”

, Pick one to two accomplishments that speak to the position or illustrate skills that are important for the job. Choose accomplishments that involve the recommender so it feel relevant to them. This will also give the letter more credibility, as you want to include accomplishments that the recommender can speak to or vouch for.For example, you may include an accomplishment like assisting a student when you were a teaching assistant for the recommender’s class. Or you may include an accomplishment like working with a team of coworkers to get a project done that was overseen by the recommender.
You may write, “ability to assist a student who needed guidance and direction in the class was a joy to witness. impressed me with their tact, professionalism, and ability to communicate with students on a peer to peer level.”

, In the second body paragraph, make sure you reinforce that you recommend the applicant whole heartedly. Include one to two sentences that highlight the recommendation as well as a brief summary why. This will underscore the recommender’s high opinion of you and make it clear that you are a strong applicant.For example, you may write, “I confidently recommend to join your team at ” or “Without a doubt, I confidently recommend as a student in your graduate program.”

, Finish the letter by including contact information for the recommender. This could be an email address or a phone number. Then, include a formal sign off like “Best wishes,” “Sincerely,” or “Best,” and the recommender’s name, typed. Leave a blank space between the sign off and the recommender’s name so they can sign the letter.For example, you may write, “Please feel free to contact me at in the event you would like to discuss ’s qualifications and skills in more detail. I would be happy to provide more information on my recommendation.”

, Once you have completed a draft of the letter, sit down and read it out loud to yourself. Listen to how each sentence flows and determine if each sentence makes sense. Revise any confusing words and clarify any sentences that are too long or convoluted. Check that you use language that is consistent and professional throughout the letter.You may also find it helpful to read the letter out loud to someone else, such as a peer or a coworker. Ask them for feedback on the letter to make sure it comes across as professional and effective.

, You are writing the letter from the perspective of the recommender, so the tone and voice in the letter should match their tone and voice in class or at work. Make sure the letter has a tone of professionalism and eloquence. Read over the letter to ensure the language use and word choice follow that of the recommender.When in doubt, keep the sentences simple, polished, and to the point. Trying to include too many obscure references or words will only make the letter more confusing and difficult to read.

, Make sure there are no spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors in the letter. Having even a single spelling error will make the reader suspicious that the recommender wrote the letter or that the letter has been polished so it is at its best.Run the letter through spell check on your computer and read it backwards to check that each word is correct.

, When you feel the letter of recommendation is the best it can be, submit it to the recommender to be signed. The recommender may review the letter and confirm it is to their standard before they sign it. Or they may revise the letter as they see fit and give it back to you signed.


Make sure you submit the letter to the recommender a few days or weeks before the deadline for your application so they have enough time to read the letter over and sign it.

, If the interviewer mentioned a need for specific skills that you have, then remind the interviewer of those skills.

Connect your qualifications with the position.,
Be as specific as possible.,
Don't include information included on your resume.,
Write to get the interview.,
Revise and proofread your letter.,
Keep it simple and concise.,
Format the letter appropriately.,
Think about including a postscript.",How to Write an Introductory Letter," Introductory letters should be addressed to the person who will be reading it, whenever possible. If you're submitting to a general account or hiring company and you're not sure, addressing a letter ""All concerned"" or addressing a letter to the hiring manager or the titled position is also appropriate.


Begin your letter by stating your position, title, or role and explaining why you're writing. You don't usually have to include your name in the letter, because your name will be included in your signature.;
, As early as possible in a letter of introduction, you need to express your reason for writing. What do you want? Why are you writing? If these questions even occur to an employer or company, your letter is more likely to end up in the trash than to end up getting you an interview.


Cut to the chase: ""I am writing today to inquire about openings for a new comptroller"" or ""I am writing to outline the features of a new product recently unveiled by my company"" are perfectly effective statements of purpose, which should be one of the earliest sentences in the letter.

, When writing an introductory letter, it's good to have a consistent, competent style that doesn't stray too far toward familiarity or end up sounding too stiff or technical. For a letter of introduction, your tone should be professional, but not cold or robotic. It's important to have some element of human warmth in the letter, while keeping the overall content professional.


One common mistake that inexperienced writers make is in avoid contractions at all cost, to such a degree the letter ends up sounding like it was translated, rather than written. Use contractions, letting the letter sound conversational, but also professional. Let the letter represent you.
Don't try to sound smart by substituting thesaurus words for words you would normally use. This isn't a master's thesis, this is an intro letter. Use the appropriate words and be concise.

, Explain how you came to learn about the position, the opportunity, or the company to which you're writing, and outline your connection to it. Upon reading an introduction letter, the employer or hiring coordinator should have a clear sense of who you are, why you want the job, and whether or not you'd be a good fit for the position. If this connection is powerful enough, you'll end up with an interview and give yourself the chance to get the job.


If you have any connection to anyone who works at the company, or if you've been referred to apply, or if you know someone who's previously been awarded a grant from your institution for their work, it's good to make a note of that early in the introduction. This can be a way of jogging someone's memory (""Oh, this is who Jim told me about!""), or establish it for the first time.

, If you're trying to explain your qualifications, competence, and your ability to take on jobs or projects, it's important to make those connections clear in a few sentences and explain the ways in which your experience doing other things connects to your ability to do this thing, whether it be a new position, or a transfer, or an entirely new job.


Outline some of the experience that you have in the field or industry you reference in the letter. If you have targeted the introductory letter as mentioned, it will be focused on some kind of professional field or industry. It's helpful to include specific skills and experience in order to make the letter effective.Wanting a job is not the same thing as qualifying for it. If you outline in the introduction that you're interested in interviewing for the job because you'd made an excellent fit, you don't need to repeat yourself fifty times throughout. Writing that you ""really really need this job"" doesn't make you seem like a more attraction candidate.

, Set up a time that you can meet in person, or express what exactly you would like to happen next in response to your letter. If you want to discuss your qualifications further with an interview, say so. If you want the job outright, say so. Learn everything you can about the hiring process, or the application process to which you're writing, then ask for the next step in the process.


Focus the introductory letter toward a specific job level. This job type or position doesn't have to be explicitly mentioned, but keep in mind what kind of result you are going after in order to keep the letter relevant.

, Listing out your degrees, your awards, and name-dropping in an intro letter is a bad idea. Repeating information that can be quickly glanced at on your resume is a waste of space in the letter. You're not trying to write about information that can be gleaned more quickly and easily elsewhere. You're writing to sell yourself and to get your foot in the door.

, It's unlikely that you're ever going to get a job or be awarded anything that you want from the strength of a letter alone. Writing the letter gets you a foot in the door, a chance to prove yourself and your ability to be the person or the employee that the reader of the letter needs. For this reason, it's good to cut to the chase, highlight your qualifications and connections to the position and try to get to the next stage in the process, whether that be an interview or some other hiring step.


Reiterate the most important information in the conclusion. Just before you close the letter with an appropriate salutation, it's a good idea to briefly reiterate the thing that you want, directly.

, After writing a draft, it's absolutely essential to go back over your letter and clean it up on the sentence level and beyond. All good writers know that a piece of writing doesn't happen until it's revised. Once you've written your letter, you've got the hard part done, but you've still got to save enough time to clean it up and make it good.


Revising is more than cleaning up your typos and spelling errors. Give your letter a whole second look and make sure that the subjects and verbs are all in agreement, that your meaning is clear, and that your letter accomplishes what it needs to accomplish.
Once you've gotten the writing as successful as possible, it's ok to start proofreading and looking for ""late concerns,"" the last-minute things, including fixing typos, spelling errors, and formatting your letter.

, Introductory letters, in general, should not be longer than the front side of one page, or between 300 and 400 words. Whatever the reason, it's likely that you're writing to someone who's got a lot of paperwork to go through in a given day, and won't want to sift through an especially long, over-written introductory letter. It'd be a shame to end up with all your hard work in the garbage, so it's important to keep it short. Only focus on communicating the most important information in your letter., Letters need to be oriented on the page correctly, featuring a distinct introduction, body paragraphs, and a succinct conclusion. If you turn in a single whooshing paragraph with no contact information or salutation, you're not going to get the job, or get an introduction.


Include a CV or resume as appropriate, following the introductory letter. The intro should be the first thing in any application packet.
Include good contact information. Going through the final edit of the introductory letter, make sure that important contact information is included, generally in the top right-hand corner of the header. Include your email address, phone number, and other basic contact information.

, Some business writing teachers and expert communicators recommend adding the most relevant or urgent information in a postscript (P.S.) to the letter. The reason that this often works well has to do with how people process communication in the form of a letter. Rather than putting important information in the conclusion, a postscript or P.S. can be more effective. While this can look informal to some, it might be an effective way to highlight the important information and make your letter stand out.

Buy or make your card.,
Consider the nature of the card.,
Write a draft on a spare sheet of paper.,
Be specific.,
Keep it short.,
Write your thank you message inside the card.,
Decide how you will sign off.,
Sign your name.,
Post the card or deliver it in person.",How to Write Thank You Cards," Making a card is a good show of appreciation if you have time and supplies. If you buy a card, make sure that any writing on the front or inside the card is appropriate (don’t buy a birthday card by mistake!). If you cannot find a pre-made thank you card that you like, consider buying a blank card with a nice design on the front.


Supplies for making your own cards are available at craft shops and some department stores, as well as some dollar stores.
Basic supplies for making cards include good card stock (nice thick paper); a paper cutter (if you invest in a cutter, make sure it also has a scoring blade to help create a neat fold in your cards); a glue stick, glue pen, glue dots, or double-sided tape dispenser (or a combination of these); decorative paper; ribbons and/or other embellishments; fancy pens; and envelopes.
Many craft supply shops, department stores, and dollar stores have card-making kits, which may be a better option if you are new to card-making and do not want to spend too much money on supplies.;
, You’ll need to adjust the tone of your card depending on who you are thanking.


If you’re thanking a professional connection such as a potential employer after an interview, your note will likely address the employer using “Mr.”, “Ms.”, or “Mrs.”, and then demonstrate your understanding of the job as well as your ability to do it well.
If you’re thanking a colleague for a gift or favour, you would likely address them by their first name, acknowledge the gift/favour, and then tell them how you enjoyed it/how it helped you.
If you’re thanking a close friend or family member, the card will likely be much less formal, maybe even with some humour in it.

In the example we’ll use throughout this article, you’ll be thanking your friend Pat for helping you move to a new home. As she is a close friend, your options for a card are limitless. Choose a card that is tailored to her tastes — if you’re always laughing together, you might consider buying or making her a humorous card.



, Before writing in the card, write out a draft of what you’d like to say. Make sure you’ve perfected it before writing it in the card. While writing your draft consider who you are thanking, what you are thankful for, and why you are thankful for it.


Continuing from the aforementioned example, you want to thank you friend Pat for helping your move. You are extra grateful to her because it was a stressful day and you didn’t have much help. Her help was invaluable, and you want her to know how much you appreciate it.

, Any details you can give will make the card more meaningful. Acknowledge the specific ways in which that person helped you, and explain why you are so grateful.


In thanking Pat for helping you move, instead of just writing, “Thank you for helping me move!”, specifically outline one or two things that she did that were especially amazing. Let’s say that she was particularly helpful in packing up your kitchen. In fact, you couldn’t believe how skilled she was at ensuring that your dishes were packed safely and with maximum use of space in each box.
How specific you get will depend on how much space you have inside the card. If you don’t have a lot of space to write in, keep your focus narrow.

, Unless you’ve purchased an enormous novelty card, you probably won’t have a tonne of space for your message. Consider the space while writing your draft. You may even want to cut a piece of paper to the size of the card and write your message inside of it to ensure that it fits before finalizing it inside the actual thank you card.


An example of a final message might be, “Dear Pat, Thank you so much for your help on Saturday! My entire kitchen made it to my new place without a single wine glass breaking, and that’s thanks to your insane packing skills. I don’t know what I would have done without you, and I just can’t thank you enough! Big love and hugs, Sally”

If you have enough space, you could also add something about making Pat dinner once you’ve settled into your new home.



, Once you’ve finalized what you want to say, write it neatly inside the card. If you know that you’re a messy writer, slow down and really try to make your writing as legible as possible.


If you really struggle to write legibly, consider typing out your note, printing it, and then pasting it inside the card. A written message feels more sincere, but it’s more important that the recipient can read your message.
Even if the card has a pre-printed message inside of it, your “thank you” will be more sincere if you add your own personal message beneath the pre-printed one.

, Again, this will depend upon to whom your card is directed.


If you are writing to a potential employer or professional colleague, some appropriate closing words include “All the best”, “Regards”, “Warm regards”, “Many thanks”, or “Looking forward”.Some professionals recommend avoiding closing lines like “Yours truly” or “Sincerely”, as they sound dated and cheesy; they also recommend against saying “Thank you for your consideration”, as this suggests that you are already anticipating rejection.If you are writing to a close friend or family member, you can really close it however you like, for example, “Love”, “See you soon”, “Miss you”, “Can’t wait till next time”.

In the example given in this article, the writer (Sally) signs off with “Big hugs and love”, which is appropriate given her close relationship with her friend Pat. That sort of sign-off won’t always be appropriate with a close friend, though. It really depends on your specific relationship.
If you and your friend do not say “love you” and do not hug, signing off with “Big hugs and love” would sound pretty strange! A more appropriate sign-off in that case might be, “Talk soon!” or “Let’s hang soon!”, or something else that better reflects the nature of your relationship.



, Again, legibility is important. Unless your signature is easy to read, you’ll want to print or clearly handwrite your full name.

, Consider your timeline. If you are thanking someone for a job interview, you will likely want to use a fast delivery method to ensure that the card gets there as quickly as possible.


If you choose to post the card, ensure that you verify the address before sending it.
Most businesses have their addresses online, on their websites, but it doesn’t hurt to call and verify their address if you’re unsure — note that many businesses have mailing addresses that differ from their business address.

You should check with your country’s visa office and ask if there are any requirements. For example, in Canada, you must include the following information about the person you are inviting to visit:complete name
date of birth
address and telephone number
the person’s relationship to you
the purpose of their trip
how long the person intends to stay in Canada
where the person will stay
how the person will pay for things
the date the person intends to leave Canada;
, The purpose of the letter is to put your country’s consulate at ease that your friend or family member isn’t getting a tourist visa so that they can enter the country and never leave. Accordingly, you want to make sure that the consulate knows the person intends only to stay for a limited period of time.


Go through your country’s requirements, if there are any. Make sure to include all required information.
Be sure to use your own language. The sample language provided in this article is used for illustrative purposes only. Say what you want to say in your own words and don’t worry about sounding “official.”

, You should open a blank word processing document. Set the font to a comfortable size and style. For example, Times New Roman 12 point works for many people, though you could choose something equally readable.


Set up the letter like a standard business letter. If you don’t know what a standard business letter looks like, then search online for a sample.

, At the top of the page, justified with the left-hand margin, you should insert your name and address. Include your full street address, not a P.O. Box number.

, You need to identify the people you are inviting to come visit.Tab two lines down from your address and then insert the address of the person who will be visiting you. Include name and full mailing address.

, Begin the letter informally. For example, you could write, “Dear Mom and Dad” or something similar.In some countries, you might have to address the letter to your immigration office. Check your country’s requirements.

, In the first paragraph, you should extend an invitation and state what you will do during the visit. Try to work in all necessary details, depending on your country, such as the purpose of the visit and the dates (or approximate dates) of the visit.For example, you could write: “I want to invite you to come visit me in the United States from June 1 to July 7, 2016. It would be great to show you my place and catch up. I also want you to meet my new wife, Sharon. During your visit, we can travel to San Francisco, which you’ve always wanted to see.”, You also need to include information about what financial support you will be offering your visitor.If you are offering financial support for a visit to the U.S., then remember to fill out Form I-134 Affidavit of Support, which you can get online.Sample language could read, “I will pay for everything involved in the trip: travel to and from Los Angeles, California, travel to San Francisco, and all meals and housing. I will make reservations and pay for the rooms on our road trip to San Francisco.”

, If your visitors will be staying at your home for the visit, then be sure to state that. Otherwise, include where they will be staying, such as the hotel where they have a reservation.


You could write, “You will stay with me in our guest room at my home located at the above-mentioned address. Sharon and I will provide for your food and other necessities.”

, Remember to end the letter in a natural way. You are not writing a professional business letter. Feel free to show emotion and excitement that you will soon be seeing your friends or family.


For example, you could write, “I can’t wait to see you! You will enjoy your time here, I can assure you! Love, .”Remember to include your full name (first and last). This does make the letter seem more formal. Nevertheless, the visa office will probably want the full name so that they know who is writing the letter.

, You might have to have the letter notarized. You should check with your visa office to see if this is required in your country.You can find a notary public in most courthouses and large banks. You can also use the notary locator at the website for the American Society of Notaries.Enter your zip code and find the nearest notary public.
Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification to show the notary. Generally, a valid driver’s license or passport is sufficient.

, In some countries, you will need to provide documents along with your letter. For example, in Canada you will need to provide the following documents, so you should get them before you sit down to draft your letter:a copy of your birth certificate, if you were born in Canada
a Canadian citizenship card, if you are a naturalized Canadian citizen
a copy of your PR card or IMM 1000 proof of landing, if you are permanent resident of Canada

, If your friends or relatives are visiting the United States, then you will need to fill out Form I-134, Affidavit of Support. The affidavit requires the following information:your name and address
your date and location of birth
your Certificate of Naturalization, Certificate of Citizenship, or other information if you are not a U.S. citizen
your age and how long you have resided in the U.S.
how many dependents you have
the names and addresses of who will be visiting

Be direct.,

, Avoid being to friendly or informal, and don't air your laundry here. Just be factual, direct, and professional. If there are issues, the boss already knows what they are. If the boss is clueless, this is not the time to educate them.


""Dear Mr. Flitt, I am resigning my position at FlittWidgets effective immediately. You can reach me at the address on file should that be necessary. Sincerely, David Gonaway.""

, It's ok to be friendly here—you're probably talking to somebody you get along with. (Would you bother writing to the coworker you didn't get along with? Probably not).


""Bill, you were a blast to work with—we made a great team! Hope old Flitt promotes you into my spot. If you need to talk about things, you have my number. Give me a call. Best, Dave.""

, Be respectful, be caring, but avoid terms of endearment. They'll either come off as disingenuous, or worse, cynical. End it how you want them to remember you.

Say what's on your mind.,
Consider to whom your letter will be addressed.,
Determine the mood of the letter.",How to Write Goodbye Letters3," There will be many times when a simple ""so long, see ya later"" is not how you want to leave things. For those times, you will want to let them know not just that you're leaving their lives, but why, and what you think of the time you spent together.

, This will determine the basic thrust of what you want to say, and how best to say it.


For example, a goodbye letter to a lover will be dramatically different in content and tone than a goodbye letter to a parent or sibling.

, Are you bidding farewell to your recipient in a friendly way, or will this be your last retribution? This is a serious thing to consider before committing anything to writing. A poorly-executed goodbye letter can be confusing not only to the reader, but to the writer as well.


If you are leaving a professional situation, whether saying goodbye to your company or your colleagues, keep the tone friendly and professional.
If you are saying goodbye to real friends, it's likely this is not a permanent goodbye. Keep your tone light and optimistic, and talk about when you meet again.
If you are saying goodbye to a lover, speak honestly, and remember that while things may have changed, they were once close to you. Do not offer false hope, nor spiteful recriminations.

Choose your medium.,
Create an outline.,
Begin writing.,
Take a break, and then reread your letter.,
Load your envelope.,
Seal the envelope.",How to Write Goodbye Letters4," Will this be a hand-written letter, an email, or a text message? If you do choose to write your farewell letter on traditional paper, investing a couple dollars in some classic stationary is an elegant and thoughtful touch.


Sending a text message is perhaps the most ungracious medium possible. In some cases, this might be absolute perfection.

, Contrary to the dramatic scenes in movies, letter writing should take a bit more effort than tearfully or angrily scratching some words onto paper. An outline is a great way to straighten your thoughts and organize exactly what you want to say before you begin writing. The last thing you want to do is to forget something important, or to ramble on aimlessly.

, Do not be concerned if it takes several drafts; often, the best thought out letters do. Take the time to perfect the letter, as it may well be the last communication you ever have with the recipient. Also, take the time and effort to write neatly and legibly, and to spell everything correctly. This does not change the content of your letter, but it will certainly affect the recipient's final impression of you.

, Before you place your letter in the envelope, or hit the Send button, let it settle. Once it's no longer fresh in your mind, you will find it much easier to correct any mistakes, whether those are simple spelling and grammar errors, or in the tone and content of your delivery. Having a trusted friend look over your letter can be very helpful, too.

, Including some small flourishes to your final correspondence can be a thoughtful and classy way to say goodbye.


For professional farewells to colleagues, your new business card can a nice touch.
For friends and family, a special photograph of yourself or a shared memory is a welcome addition
If the goodbye letter is to a lover, some token of your affection or of your relationship could also be stirring.

, Once you are completely content with your written, reread, and revised goodbye letter, fold it neatly and slip it into an with any pictures, cards, or other mementos. Seal it, stamp it, and drop it in the mailbox or press ""send.""

Be very clear about what you are granting.,
Include the original signature.,
Have the consent letter certified by a notary.,
Include specific details about the child if writing a travel consent letter.,
Check with authorities before you travel to make sure you have the required documents for where you are going.,
Prepare for unique circumstances.,
Bring a consent letter when a minor child is traveling overseas without both parents.,
Understand other reasons a person might need a letter of consent.,
Use standard business letter format.",How to Write Letter of Consent," Consent letters don’t need to be very long. But they need to explicitly say who is granting consent to whom and for what. As in, I (your name) grant (their name) consent to (be specific here about what you are giving them permission for or to do).


Ask yourself why you are writing the letter. This will help you focus it. Be extremely simple and direct in language. There’s no reason to include unnecessary information such as motivation or creative flourishes. Those are bad ideas because they could muddy the message, and the consent needs to be extremely clear. For example, if you are giving consent so your daughter can get a Japanese passport, just say that.Follow the rules required for the specific type of consent. For example, some companies may require that you verify your identity as parent or legal guardian before giving your minor child consent to use their services., You need to make sure that the consent letter is signed, and it’s a good idea if it’s signed in front of a witness who is not the same person receiving consent.If the consent letter is for a corporation, it must be signed by an officer of the corporation.
In the case of Limited Liability Company, the manager must sign the letter. If there is not a manager, a member of the LLC can sign it.
If the consent letter is for something like consent to use a trade name, and the trade name is owned by more than one person, both owners must sign it.

, It’s a good idea to have an official certify, stamp, or seal the consent letter to verify to its accuracy.


You can find many templates for detailed consent letters online that include a section for a notary. Don't skip this part or your consent letter's validity might be questioned. Check at your local post office or courthouse for a notary. Most such offices will have one. A notary verifies that you are the actual person who signed the letter (or that the other parent is the person who did so). It removes doubt.

, If you are writing a consent letter for your child to travel alone or with another parent overseas, make sure that you include pertinent information about the child.


The letter should include the child’s full name, date of birth, place of birth, passport number, date of issuance of passport, and place of issuance of passport. If neither parent is traveling with the child, both parents should sign the consent letter. Include flight numbers and other specific travel information.Write that you grant permission for the child (include child's name) to travel to the country (which you should name) with the name of anyone accompanying the child. Include the accompanying person’s name, passport number, date of issuance of passport, and place of issuance of passport.
Provide the name of the person in a foreign country the child will be staying with, if any, including address, telephone and fax numbers of that person. Write a separate consent form for each child if more than one child is traveling. , This will ensure that you are following all of the rules of the visited country.


Don’t get offended if you’re asked to prove your child’s identity. This is done to protect against child abduction and smuggling. It's also very common for a consent letter to be required.
Check with the airline, the embassy, a travel agency and/or the embassy in the country you’re traveling to. They will know if there are any special requirements., Sometimes a consent letter isn't so easy to get or prove, depending on what's going on with the other parent.


If you want to take your child out of the country but the other parent objects, you could apply to a court to seek formal permission.
If the other parent has passed away and you have a different last name, it’s a good idea to bring the deceased parent’s death certificate, your birth certificate, and your marriage certificate. The goal here is to be able to easily prove what you are saying with certified information.
If you are a foster or adoptive parent or a legal guardian of a parent take a copy of the court order designating you as such. If the child is in your care temporarily, you should get a consent letter signed by the child welfare agency representative.

, Generally speaking, it’s a good idea to have a letter of consent on hand whenever the minor child leaves the country with only one parent or without either parent, even if traveling between the United States and Canada.Some people mistakenly think the letter is not needed if the child is with one parent, is with a parent and a stepparent, or is with another relative, like a grandparent. However, the bottom line is this: if the child is traveling without one living parent, get a letter of consent from that parent.
If your last name is different from your child’s, you may need a bridging document to prove you are the child’s parent. An example of a bridging document is the child’s birth certificate bearing both parents’ names. Make sure it’s a notarized or certified copy.
The letter of consent could also give permission for the “trip custodian” (the traveling parent or adult) to authorize any necessary routine or emergency medical treatment needed during the trip. This clause is especially needed when the child is traveling without either parent, say with a school group or a grandparent.

, Although the most common letter of consent is probably for minor travel, there are other reasons people might need one. Sometimes, it’s another person providing consent to you for research or an interview you conducted.


If you are interviewing someone for a book or using a testimonial or endorsement, it’s a good idea to get an official letter of consent from that person attesting that you are authorized to use the material.Be very specific as to what will be used and where.
When conducting academic research, you will often be required ethically to obtain written consent from participants. Informed consent means you not only gain the consent of the person but that you fully inform them about all rights as a participant in your study, what it will entail, where it will be published, and whether there are any risks.Sometimes letters of consent are written by a property owner granting a person consent to use his or her property, such as a house or car. You could provide some details of how the property will be used and for what time frame and purpose.

, This will look most professional. If you are a company, put the consent letter on formal letterhead. Do not include conditions or stipulations. Consent letters should not have such provisions. They should not be overly complicated.


In business letter format, you want to include the address of the person or company you’re writing to on the top left, the date, and your name and address. Use a formal salutation and conclusion. Be polite but direct.
Although written letters can be accepted, you should type the letter or use a template you find online so that it looks more formal and professional. The signature must be handwritten, however.

Keep a copy yourself.",How to Write Persuasive Letters," Before you start your letter, brainstorm what it is you want, why you want it, reasons why it should be granted, and any arguments against you. Getting your ideas down can help you clearly draft your letter and fully understand your position on the topic.


Start by using this: I want to persuade my audience to my purpose. Exchange my audience with who you want to persuade and my purpose with what it is you want to persuade them to do.
After you have established that, ask yourself: Why? List the reasons why you want your audience to do what you want them to do.
After you brainstorm reasons, sort them by importance. Place all the important details into a column, then place all the less important details in another column. This step helps you narrow your reasoning so you emphasize the relevant, salient points., Make sure you know exactly what you want or need. What are you trying to accomplish? What do you want this office to do?


When you are figuring out your purpose, think about any solutions that you can offer., Analyzing and understanding your audience will help you decide how you should frame your letter. If possible, determine if your reader agrees with you, disagrees with you, or is neutral.This will help you decide how much weight should be placed on each side of your argument.


Try to find a real person to address your letter to. Who are they, and what power do they really have to help you? Will they just pass along your complaint? How should you address them? Are they in a senior or functionary position? Talk to them according to their position.
Try to discover what beliefs and biases the reader has about your topic. What disagreements might arise between you and your reader? How can you present a counterargument respectfully?
Figure out what concerns your reader might have with the topic. Do they have limited funds to distribute? Are they directly affected by the topic? How much time do they have to consider your document?Think about the kind of evidence your reader will need in your argument to be persuaded., Effective persuasive letters contain factual evidence and information that supports the position. Make sure to consider multiple points-of-view. Don't just research your side; mention the contrary opinion and facts surrounded it.


Use facts, logic, statistics, and anecdotal evidence to support your claim.Don't come out and say the other side is wrong; instead, be respectful as you explain why your position is stronger and deserves notice.

, Business letters have a specific format. When done properly, the formatting won't sway your reader one way or another. However, if done improperly, the formatting will reflect badly on you and your reader may toss it aside.


Start by using single-spaced, block paragraphs.
Left justify each paragraph; in other words, don't indent the paragraph like you would in prose or an essay.
Leave a line between each paragraph.
Use a standard font, typically Times New Roman or Arial, in size 12., Start by typing your address in the top left corner. Do not put your name - only type the street address, city, state, and zip code. You may also include a telephone number and an e-mail, each on separate lines. If you live in Britain, the address goes on the right side. Skip a line.


Type the date. Spell out the name of the month, then give the date and year. Skip a line.
June 4, 2013
Provide the name and address of the recipient. Try to find a specific person to send your letter to. Skip a line., Accepted practice is to start with the word Dear followed by the person's name. Make sure to spell the name correctly when you type it. The name should match the name in the letterhead address.


When addressing the person, use their title (Mr./Ms./Dr./etc) and last name. If you are unsure what a woman's preference is, refer to her as Ms.

Always follow this by a colon.
Leave a line between the salutation and the first paragraph.Dear Dr. Brown:

, Think about the tone of your essay when choosing a closing statement. Some things, like Thank you, are pretty standard, while others, like Best regards, are friendlier. Decide if your letter warrants a formal or friendly closing. No matter what you choose, the first word should be capitalized while the following words are not. Follow the closing statement with a comma.


Choose Respectfully yours, for something more formal. Sincerely, Kind regards, Thank you, or Yours truly, are standard for formal business e-mails. Best, Best regards, or Have a nice day, are much less formal and friendly.
Skip 4 lines afterwards to leave room for the signature before typing your name.
Thank you,

, Persuasive letters need to be brief and polite. Busy people seldom read such a letter if it's over a page or if the tone is nasty. Don't be overly wordy. Try to use clear, uncluttered sentences. Refrain from digressing and providing unnecessary information, asides, and anecdotes.


Avoid overly long sentences. Make sure to use strong, declarative sentences. Your writing should be succinct, to the point, and easy to read.
Don't make your paragraphs too long. Don't cram so much information inside that you lose your reader, stray from the main point, or make your point hard to understand. Stick to the relevant information, and change paragraphs when you start a new idea., Start with a friendly opening sentence, then get straight to the point. State your need (that is, your main point) in the first two sentences.This paragraph might only be 2-4 sentences.

, In this paragraph, outline your concern, request, or demand. You are not giving specific reasons, support, or points yet; instead, you are fully explaining your position, the parameters of your concern or request, and why it is important enough to warrant action.Remember to keep it logical, polite, and factual. Avoid overly emotional language, don't demand action, or be rude to the person or company you are writing to or opposing sides.

, The next few paragraphs should justify your position by providing background information and details. Make sure they are logical, factual, reasonable, practical, and legal. Don't base your appeal simply on emotions, faith, or personal desires. Don't bore the reader with a long story; get to the point quickly and accurately. There are a few different strategies you can employ to achieve this:


Cite statistics and facts to appeal to your reader's reason. Make sure your statistics and facts are from credible, respected sources, and that you are using them truthfully and not taking them out of context.
Quote experts on the topic who support your position or disagree with the other side. These experts should be respected in their fields and be qualified to have an opinion on the subject.Provide a reason why your request should be granted. Telling someone they need to do something isn't a very effective persuasive technique, but explaining to them why you believe something should be done can help change their mind.Explain the current situation and why it needs to change.
Provide details, specifications, and limitations to your position and request. Talk about past efforts related to your request, or the lack of any action.
Give examples of testimonials that relate to your position. Think of any other evidence you can provide as to why your position matters.Just remember to limit what you include in your paragraphs. State your case and situation simply. Don't go into excess detail, but do include all the essential points. Choose only the most relevant statistics, experts, and testimonials.

, One key to effective persuasion is to address the opposing side. You want to predict any counterarguments, objections, or questions your readers will have so you can address them in your letter. Find common ground with the opposition, or provide strong support for your own position.


Make sure to openly admit differences between your position and the opposing side. Don't try to hide them; this weakens your argument. Instead, stress shared values, experiences, and problems with the opposing side.
Avoid judgmental statements. That puts too much emotion into your letter and lessens your logical appeal. Being overly negative and judgmental may deter the other side from agreeing with you., Restate your request or opinion at the end. This is the paragraph where you can suggest a solution or call to action. Tell the reader that you will follow up on this correspondence by phone, email, or in person.


Aim to end with a powerful sentence that will help to persuade your reader to be on your side, or to at least see things more clearly from your perspective.
Offer your own solutions or help. Agree to compromise, or meet in the middle. Show what you have already done or are prepared to do to deal with the situation.

, Poor grammar and misspelled words give a bad first impression. You want the reader to focus on your ideas and your request, not the errors in your letter. Reread the letter multiple times before sending it. Read the letter aloud to hear how it sounds.


If needed, have someone check your writing for spelling (or use your spell checker in the software).

, If you are mailing the letter instead of sending an e-mail, then you need to sign the letter. This both personalizes and authenticates your letter.

, If there are other people in the company or at another organization that need to see the letter, send them a copy. This means printing and sending more than one letter, with original signatures.

, Always keep a letter for your own records, along with when you sent the letter and who you sent it to. Write notes on your follow-up efforts until the matter is resolved.

Do not write anything creepy or inappropriate.",How to Write Fan Mail1," Include your name, where you are from, and your age in the letter. Mention your personal connection to the person or the work that they do. You can also mention anything that you and the person may have in common.If you are writing to your favorite basketball player, you might say, ""Hello, my name is ___. I am ___ years old, and I am from ___. I have been playing basketball since elementary school.""
If you were writing to your favorite singer, you may say, ""Hi, I'm ____ from ___. I'm ___ years old. I love to sing and write music just like you do."";
, Are you writing to compliment a specific thing they did? Are you writing a general ""I love you"" letter? Did the person make a positive impact on your life or inspire you? Write what you feel.This will make your letter feel more sincere and genuine.
For example, instead of saying ""I like your music,"" say ""I am a big fan of your music. My favorite song/album is ___. Your music helped get through ___.""

, The person you are sending the letter to probably receives a lot of fan mail. Keep your letter short and to the point. If your letter is too long, the person may not read all of it. You are also more likely to get a response if your letter is short.If you type your letter, limit it to one page, single-spaced.If your letter is specific, you should have no problem keeping the letter short.

, Although you may admire and look up to the person you are writing a letter to, the person is still a stranger. Do not include any information beyond your name, age, and address. This is to keep you safe.Sending your address will increase the chances of you getting a response, autograph, or fan club gift.
Also avoid sending any personal items that you want to get back. For example, you would not send your only copy of a picture or item that you wanted the person to sign. You may or may not get a response, and you will have lost that item forever.

, If you would like for the person to respond to you or send you an autograph let them know. They may or may not respond, but it never hurts to ask. It is best to not expect to hear back. If you do hear back, it will be a nice surprise.Be specific if you want something back. For example, you may say, ""I would love an autographed picture from you. Thank you so much.""
Avoid asking questions in your letter and expecting the person to respond.

, Your letter should simply tell the person that you enjoy what they do, and how it has had a positive effect on you.Do not ask for any personal information, ask to come visit them, threaten them, or talk about anything sexual. You do not want to make the person feel uncomfortable or seem like a stalker.


It is against the law to threaten a person through the mail. You could go to jail or have to pay a fine. If you would not be comfortable saying the content of the letter to the person's face, you probably shouldn't write it to them either.

Obtain their address.,
Include other items with your letter.,
Have enough postage.",How to Write Fan Mail2," Visit the person's website to find their address. The person may have a special address for people to send fan mail to. If you do not find a specific address for the person, you may be able to find the address for their manager, agent, or publisher.


For example, if you send your letter to a writer, send the letter to the company that publishes their books and write ""Attention: Name of Writer"" on the address.
Many celebrities have official fan club websites and official websites. Make sure you send your letter to the address from the official website., You may want to send a photograph or some fan art that you created. This is a nice way to add a personal touch and give the person a gift. Many celebrities display fan art on their social media pages.


You could send a picture of yourself at the person's concert or in front of an advertisement they are in.
If the person is on the cover of a magazine, take a picture of you holding the magazine and send it to them.
If you're creative, you could draw a picture of the person and send it to them.

, Once you have your letter ready, place it in an envelope and send it. Make sure you have enough postage on the envelope. You may need more postage if the envelope is thick and/or heavy.


Also consider the destination. If you are mailing a letter overseas or to another country, you will need more postage than usual.

Limit your email to 4 or 5 sentences.
If the person does not have website, visit one of their social media pages and look for their contact information.

, Another way to contact a celebrity is by commenting on their social media posts. Instagram and Facebook allow you to comment on particular posts. You will not be able to write as much as you would in a letter, but this is a quick way to show your appreciation.


Look through previous posts to find out if the celebrity usually responds to and interacts with fans. If this is the case, you may be able to get a response.
Even if the person does not respond to your comment, they may read what you wrote.
You may get a quicker response by interacting with the person through social media than through sending a written letter., You can send the person a direct message on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. If you do not want other people to see what you write, this is the best way to go. Keep your message short and to the point.


Do not bombard the person with direct messages every single day. This will not make them respond to you.
Also, do not contact a person using all of the methods at once. For example, do not comment, send an email, and send a direct message. This can make you look bad.

They will be dealing with funeral arrangements and preparing for their final goodbyes.If you miss this timeframe or find out about the death months after it has occurred, go ahead and write the letter. There is no need to explain why your card is arriving late.;
, Writing a general condolence letter will not be very comforting to the griever. Be aware that you are writing about the griever’s loved one. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable.Refer to the deceased by name. For example, you may say something like “I am very sorry to hear about Janie’s passing.”

, Each death is different and each person deals with grief in a different way. Avoid telling a griever how to grieve or what to do next. Unless you know and feel comfortable with their religion affiliations, avoid using religious opinions within the letter.Avoid saying things like “everything happens for a reason” or “they are in a better place.”
Avoid saying things like “I know how you feel.” Everyone’s pain is different and this will not be comforting to the griever.

It is important to let the person in prison know how often you can write letters. This allows the incarcerated individual to maintain his or her expectations and allows you to manage your busy life., Writing letters may be one of the only ways that an incarcerated individual can talk about how he or she is managing in prison. In order to facilitate an open dialogue and let the person know that you are interested in hearing about his or her life, ask open-ended questions. The incarcerated person may or may not choose to respond to the questions. However, by asking the questions you are letting the person know that you are willing to listen. Some questions that you can ask in your letter may include:


How are you feeling?
What are you doing to keep busy?
What can I do to help support you?, Having your partner incarcerated places significant strain on your relationship. It is important to find ways to stay connected to your loved one while the person is incarcerated. It is important to communicate honestly, regularly, and when possible to include your partner in decision-making.


Tell your partner about your plans and your regular schedule.
If your incarcerated partner is reading a particular book or watching a particular show, read or watch the same thing and discuss it in your letter. This provides you with a common interest while your partner is incarcerated.
If you have children, share details about your child’s life.
Write about decisions that you are trying to make about jobs, school, friendships and ask for your partner’s advice.
Be clear about what you can and cannot do. For example, if your incarcerated partner wants you to write every day and you are unable to do that, explain that to your partner and talk about your feelings or concerns honestly., Often, letters are the main way that a child can communicate with an incarcerated parent. Writing to a parent can help the child express his or her feelings, feel connected to an incarcerated parent or even lay the groundwork for a future relationship with the parent. If a child has difficulty expressing his or her feelings of sadness, loneliness, abandonment, or anger, it is important for a caregiver to help the child find the words and either write or dictate these feelings in a letter. It is important to share details of the child’s life with the parent, including drawings from the child or schoolwork. Potential topics to write about in a letter include:


Shared interests such as sports, school, or books.
Current events.
Special events, such as graduation, birthdays or holidays.
Favorite memories, particularly about the incarcerated parent.
Provide updates on the child’s life, such as how the child is doing in school or in extracurricular events., When you choose to write a prisoner you must understand that you are not engaging in charity but in taking the time to get to know another individual and potentially making a new friend. Therefore, before choosing to write a prisoner you should think about whether you can make the time to maintain the correspondence. It can be incredibly disappointing to an incarcerated person to have someone reach out once or twice and then never hear from that person again., There are a number of organizations and online businesses that connect individuals with incarcerated people looking for pen pals. You can find these websites by conducting an internet search for the phrase: write to a person in prison.


Some of these websites charge prisoners a fee for them to sign-up and others may charge users a fee to connect with prisoners.
These websites may suggest that you use the website for friendship rather than for finding romantic relationships.
The website may not verify any of the information provided by the prisoner.
Look to see how long the website/company has been in business.
Look for online reviews to see whether the company is considered reputable., When you write an incarcerated individual, it is important to be clear about your reasons for writing the letter. If you are looking for friendship or to offer support you should state this in your letter. You should also state how often you will be able to correspond to the prisoner.


Some incarcerated individuals may be seeking a romantic relationship. If you are not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship you should clearly and kindly explain your position.
Some individuals may ask you for money or to do things for them outside of prison. You can politely refuse the request and explain that you will not be giving them money., When you write your first letter to an incarcerated individual, you should keep that letter relatively short. You can explain who you are and how you got their name. You should also tell the person why you wanted to write to them.


You should be prepared to maintain the correspondence for at least six months.
Do not make any commitments that you feel that you can’t meet.
Make sure that you follow any of the prison’s rules about what can and cannot be included in a letter (discussed below)., If you are interested in getting to know an incarcerated person by exchanging letters, it is important that you share some stories or details about your life. You should only share what you feel comfortable sharing. If you think about the pen pal process of getting to know someone, it is important that they get to know you some as well so that they feel a connection to the outside world.


Your letters will be read by prison officials so it is important to refrain from discussing any criminal activity, or anything else prohibited by prison regulations., When establishing a pen pal relationship, you need to provide the prisoner with an address where you can receive letters. While many people provide their home address, others choose to keep their home address private and instead set up a post office box (P.O. box). Whichever you choose is fine but generally, prisons require letters to have a return address on the envelope in order for the letter to be given to the prisoner., Generally, prisons have specific rules regarding what a prisoner can receive in the mail. Before sending a letter to a prisoner, go online and see whether the prison has a website. You should check the website for regulations regarding mail and make sure your letter meets all of the requirements.


You can find a prison website by searching the internet for the name of the prison and the words: send mail to a prisoner.
This search should direct you to either a website for a prison or to the governmental entity (state or federal) that manages the prison and sets forth regulations regarding prisoner correspondence.

, While you should follow the specific guidelines for the prison where the incarcerated person resides, typically your letter should be addressed to the prisoner’s legal name, followed by the prisoner’s number. The next line should list the cell/bunk location, if given, followed by the name of the prison. The following lines should include the street address or P.O. Box for the prison followed by the city, state and zip code., The prison regulations will outline a number of things that you are prohibited from sending a prisoner as well as topics that you are prohibited from writing about. For example, in many prisons you cannot send a book directly but instead the book must be sent from a publishing house or a distributor. With regard to the content of the letter, you are prohibited from writing about anything that describes or encourages criminal activity. Some additional items or content that is prohibited include:


Letters that have staples or paper clips.
Cash.
Cards with electronic components.
Nude photographs or photographs which reveal genitalia, buttocks, or breasts.
Polaroid photos.
Any descriptions of physical violence.
Any descriptions of drugs or other intoxicants.
Any discussion or description of the use or construction of a weapon."

Consider applying for a protective order.,
Engage in “self help” if you are sure there is no legal tenancy.",How to Write an Eviction Letter," Your legal relationship is with the person named in your lease. You need to address your eviction letter to that individual.;
, You need to state, very clearly and concisely, that the purpose of the letter is to evict the tenant. If you try to be too polite or overly cautious in your writing, you may run the risk of confusing the issue.


Your letter should simply state, in the first sentence, ""This letter is to notify you that you are directed to vacate the property at ___(address)___ no later than ___(date)___.""

, If you are allowing the tenant to remedy the situation and stop the eviction process, state clearly what needs to be done and the date by which it needs to be completed. There are several common reasons for wishing to evict a tenant:


Fails to pay the rent on time;
Breaks the lease or rental agreement and will not fix the problem (like keeping pets when pets are not allowed);
Damages the property bringing down the value (commits ""waste"");
Becomes a serious nuisance by disturbing other tenants and neighbors even after being asked to stop; or
Uses the property to do something illegal., Make sure that your description of the basis for eviction is clear enough to be understood by an uninvolved party. If you allege that the tenant has failed to pay rent, specify the dates that payments were due and the amounts of each one. If you believe that the tenant has damaged the property, clearly identify what has been damaged and what you require to make full repairs.For example, if you are evicting the tenant for failure to pay rent, you might say, ""My records indicate that you have missed the following rent payments: May 1, 2015 for $1,250; June 1, 2015, for $1,250; and July 1, 2015, for $1,250. The total amount due is $3,750.""
If you are evicting the tenant for damages to the property, you may write, ""According to Paragraph 8 of the Lease Agreement, you are responsible for maintaining the property in good order. On my last visit to your apartment, on November 13, 2015, I noticed significant burns on the carpet covering about 3 square feet, scratches and tears in the wallpaper, and at least five separate gouges or holes in the living room wall.""

, Be sure you are within the legal time frame for your jurisdiction. There are state laws that limit how quickly you can demand a tenant vacate the property. The time for eviction usually depends on a combination of the length of the original lease term and the reason for eviction.


For example, if the tenant has a 30-day month-to-month lease, you generally need to allow the end of the current month and one full month beyond.
For some extreme violations, like commission of a crime or repeated failures to pay rent, you may be able to demand a quicker eviction.After you determine what the law allows for a time frame, set a specific date in your letter: ""According to the Lease Agreement, you are hereby directed to vacate the property no later than April 30, 2015.""

, If the situation ends up going to court, you will need to show proof you provided the required amount of time for an eviction notice and followed the law.

, Your eviction letter is not valid unless you serve it to the tenant and can later show that you complied with state regulations for service. The easiest method is simply to hand the letter to the tenant in person. However, many tenants may try to avoid service, if they expect such a letter. For that reason, states will allow alternative methods of service.


For example, in California, you may either deliver a copy directly to the tenant or leave the notice with someone over the age of 18 at the tenant’s residence or place of business. In this second case, you must also send one copy by mail.You can, and should, send a copy of an eviction letter by certified mail. This requires a small fee when you mail it, but then the mail carrier will get a signature from the tenant as proof of delivery.
You may also hire a courier service to deliver the eviction letter to the tenant in hand. This requires a slightly higher fee, but provides a higher degree of certainty and proof.

, Your relationship with your tenant begins with the written lease. In general, you cannot enforce something that is not already made a part of the lease agreement between you. Before you begin taking any steps to evict your tenant, make sure that you are familiar with all the terms of the lease, and be sure that the lease supports your reason for eviction., In addition to violating the lease agreement, a tenant may be in violation of some state law or local housing tenant regulation. Each state has its own laws that govern landlord-tenant relationships. You need to become familiar with the laws of your state.A handy site with links to landlord-tenant laws for all 50 states can be found at http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/state-landlord-tenant-laws.

, If you have any doubt about your right to evict your tenant, you should consult with a real estate attorney. Before you begin taking steps to evict a tenant, you need to be sure that you are acting within the law. If you step beyond your authority, you could cause the tenant to file a counterclaim against you. The law generally places a higher burden on the landlord, because you elected to get into this business.

, Many large cities will have a governmental agency called the housing authority (or some similar title) that sets local regulations. The housing authority also exists to provide moderate legal assistance to landlords and tenants to resolve disputes.


For example, the Boston Housing Authority (BHA), Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) all have websites that contain information for landlords and tenants., If the reason for eviction is something that could be remedied, you may wish simply to speak with the tenant before taking other action. This is not a legal requirement, but it is a simple step to avoid turning something small into a large legal dispute.


For example, if your tenant is not maintaining the property in the way you believe it should be maintained, you and the tenant may just have different standards. If you meet with the tenant and explain your expectations, the tenant may be able to correct the problem.It is a good idea to put your concerns in writing. This is not an eviction letter at this point. It is just a written notice that you would like the tenant to correct some problem. By putting your concern in writing, you will have some evidence later.
A sample letter for this purpose would say something like, ""On my last visit to your apartment on November 30, 2015, I noticed some unacceptable damage to the living room rug and the wallpaper in the kitchen. These need to be repaired promptly, or I will be forced to take action to evict you.""

, Don’t expect the problem to be resolved immediately. When you present the tenant with your concern, allow a reasonable amount of time for the correction to occur. Then, if the tenant does not take care of things, you can proceed with an eviction letter.This time period should be short -- a few days is usually reasonable at this stage. When you submit your actual eviction letter, there will be a requirement for a longer notice period that is usually set by state law.
Be clear and precise. Set a specific date, even if you may extend that date later. For example, your letter might say, ""I expect the repairs for these problems to be completed by December 15, 2015. If they are not done by then, I will have to proceed with eviction.""

, If your reason for evicting the tenant is something clear like non-payment of rent, a mediation may not work. But for a dispute that is less obvious, you may want to consider a mediation session. Mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution that is often successful in limiting legal action and costs.Contact your housing court or city hall to try to locate a mediation service. Many housing courts or housing authority offices will offer free or low cost mediation services to resolve landlord-tenant disputes.

, This seems obvious, but many people in this situation might skip the obvious first step and jump to legal action. If you have a friend or family member who is staying beyond his or her invitation, you should very simply ask him or her to leave. You can be polite and even allow some time to prepare to go, but you should be clear and firm in your expectation.


Say something like, ""I've enjoyed having you here, but I believe it is time for you to move on. Please make arrangements to move out by next Friday.""
This applies equally to your own children, if they have grown but have not moved out yet. If you believe it is time for them to move on and become self-reliant, have a conversation and tell them it is time to go., If you have a formal written lease agreement, then it makes no difference if the tenant is a friend or relative. You must still comply with state and local law regarding evictions. However, more likely, you have let someone stay in your place, and they have overstayed their welcome, without a written agreement. In some cases, under state law, a legal tenancy may still exist.If the friend or relative has contributed to living costs, food or utilities, these payments could be considered “rent.” Under state law in some states, this could be enough to create a legal tenancy. You will need to consult with a local real estate attorney.

, If you decide that a legal tenancy has been created, or if you just want to be cautious, you should proceed with the steps toward a formal eviction. That would include writing and delivering an eviction notice as outlined here. In such a case, you would treat the individual’s tenancy as a month-to-month tenancy for 30 days at a time. This will help determine the amount of notice time you must provide., This is a hearing in court, in which you present the facts to a judge and ask for an order for the individual to leave. You will need to prove that you are the owner of the property and that the friend or relative has no legal right to remain in the property.If you succeed at the unlawful detainer hearing, the judge will issue a date for the friend or relative to leave the property. If he or she does not leave by that time, you will be able to contact the local sheriff, show him or her the order, and the sheriff will remove the individual by physical force if necessary.

, If the friend or relative is abusive toward you and makes you fear for your safety, you can go to court to request a protective order. If applicable, a protective order can be granted immediately, without any of the waiting periods connected with eviction.If you are successful in obtaining a protective order, it is advisable to proceed with formal eviction steps anyway. Even though the individual is out of the house, you should send a formal eviction notice and follow the remaining steps to make the eviction final.

, If you are certain that the person in your house has no legal tenancy right (you should consult with an attorney before reaching this conclusion), you may engage in what is called “self help.” You are allowed to take whatever steps you consider necessary to get the person out of your home. These may include changing the locks or moving his or her property to a commercial storage facility.


Be careful if you choose to take these actions. If you are wrong about the tenancy, you could be facing a lawsuit against you for wrongful eviction. If you engage in self help to remove property, the individual could charge you with damaging or losing any property. You should be careful to keep an inventory and have a witness when dealing with other people’s property in this way.

Acknowledge their loss.,
Express your own sadness.,
Include fond memories.",How to Write Condolence Letters2," There is no reason to ignore the reason that you are writing the letter. It is perfectly acceptable to acknowledge the pain of their loss. Be sure that your letter is more focused on the loss that the griever is experience instead of the death of the person.Say something like, “I’m so sorry for your loss,” instead of something like “I’m sorry that John died.”

, If you have a personal relationship with the deceased or the griever it is important to also express your feelings about the situation. Let the griever know that the death of their loved one has impacted your life as well but be sure to bring the topic back to the griever.Try saying something like, “I was so sad to hear about your husband’s passing.”

, The griever will likely enjoy hearing stories about their loved one. This can be a story that they have already heard or a story that they have never heard before. This story will remind them of the great life that their loved one lived. It will also remind them of the many people that were present in various stages of their loved one’s life.Share a childhood memory by referring to things that happened in your youth. Say something like, “I remember when we were young and we spent our summer days at the pool.”
Remember the deceased's personality and strengths by saying something along the lines of, “Sarah was so funny. She could make anyone laugh.”

Offer to help the grieving person.,
Avoid writing a long letter.,
Consider using a quote.,
End your letter by expressing comfort.",How to Write Condolence Letters3," The bereaver will be offered a lot of assistance by many people. Make sure that your offer is tangible and specific. Be genuine with your offer and follow through if they take you up on it. If you are too general in your offer it will not seem genuine and might be too difficult for the bereaver to deal with while grieving.Make a specific offer by saying something like, “Can I help you by taking care of your pets while you are out of town?”
You might also offer to cook meals or clean for them.
Avoid saying something like, “What can I do to help?”

, Make your letter short and to the point. Keep in mind that they will be reading many letters, emails, and receiving many phone calls over the next several weeks. A lengthy letter might spark tears, which can make reading physically difficult., It is best to use your own words. However, sometimes it is difficult to come up with your own words. If you are having trouble writing something, consider using a quote that conveys what you are trying to put into words. You can also include a quote at the end of your letter to wrap up your thoughts.To make it more genuine, write it out by hand instead of buying a card with a quote printed on the inside.

, You can use a comforting phrase or simply a comforting word. The end of the letter should show your support for their healing. Keep in mind things that you would feel are comforting if you were grieving.An example of a comforting phrase is, “You and your family are in my thoughts.”
You can also end a letter by signing the card with the word “Sincerely.”

Use appropriate writing conventions.",How to Write an Office Letter," There are three popular formats to use: block, modified block, and semi-block. Block format means that all elements of the letter are aligned to the left of the page, modified block allows for some elements to be shifted to the right, and semi-block is aligned left but each paragraph is indented.Block format is the most formal and widely used format. If you are unsure of what type of format to use, this is the best choice.
Keep in mind that different organizations utilize different formatting techniques, so be flexible in your formatting if needed.;
, The standard for font selection is Times New Roman, 12 point. Arial is also considered an acceptable font. The important thing to remember is not only readability of the letter but also who your audience is.


For example, if you are writing to a conservative organization you should choose the standard Times New Roman. Alternatively, if your organization is more liberal, you have more leeway to choose different fonts., Margins are the areas of white blank space around the edge of the writing area.Most word processors are automatically set to the standard (1-inch margins all around), but you can always double check to make sure you are formatting correctly.


Check the proportions of the letter by using print preview.

, Business letters should be typed (single-spaced) on a word processor that is set to print to 8 ½"" by 11"" blank, white paper.

, The heading is the return address (usually 2-3 lines) and it contains information about the organization and where the reader can return any correspondence. It includes organization name (first line), street address (second line), and city and state (third line).


The heading should be placed two inches from the top of the page.
It is also acceptable to include additional contact information (phone, email, fax) after the third line of the address.Try not to use abbreviations (for example, spell street instead of st.). If abbreviating the state, make sure you use the standard postal service abbreviations and capitalize both letters.
You do not have to include a heading if your company has a standard letterhead which includes all of the organization's identifying information.

, When using block style, always skip a line and then include the date under the return address. The standard American formatting for the date is: month, day, and year (including a comma after the day). Do not abbreviate months, and use four digits for the year.The standard British formatting for the date is: day, month, year (with no comma).
If using letterhead instead of a heading, place the date three lines below the last line of the letterhead.

, The inside address is the recipient's title, full name, and address. This should be included one line below the sender's U.S. postal address or one inch below the date. It is always aligned to the left.Always write to a specific individual at an organization. If you don't have a name or title, call or go online to do some research.
Include the highest title possible (Dr., Professor, etc.). If addressing a woman without a professional title, determine whether she should be addressed as Mrs., Ms. or Miss. When in doubt, use Ms.
When using international addresses, include the name of the country (in all capital letters) on the last line.

, Use the same name/title utilized in the inside address. The type of greeting will depend on your relationship with the recipient, but the most common greeting is ""Dear,"" followed by the recipient's name and a colon. The salutation should be placed on the left margin, two lines below the inside address.


If you don't know the recipient's name, you can also use phrases such as ""To whom it may concern"" or ""Dear Sir or Madam.""
In British English, you do not need a colon after the recipient's name. Instead, leave it blank or use a comma., The subject line is a sentence which helps the reader quickly understand the purpose of your letter. It is completely optional. It is usually preceded by the word Subject: or Re: and can be placed either one line below the greeting, or directly after the inside address.To make the subject line stand out, you can use bold font, all caps, or underline the text.

, This is where you introduce both who you are and your purpose for writing the letter. This should be aligned to the left, two lines below the salutation (or whatever is before the body of the letter).


If using block or modified block formats, no indentation is necessary. Only indent if using a semi-block format.

, The additional paragraphs should provide more details, more background information, or clarify any information.This should again be left aligned, single-spaced, and only indented if using semi-block format. Skip a line between each new paragraph.


Add an additional paragraph anytime you introduce a new idea or new information.Remember that it's important to be concise and get straight to the point in business letters. Try not to let your paragraphs drag or run on longer than necessary., This is the final paragraph of your letter. It should remind the reader of your main point and provide the reader with a request for a follow up action (if required)., The complementary closing is a brief, polite phrase that brings your letter to an end. It should be one space below the ending of the body of the letter. Standard closings include phrases such as Sincerely, Sincerely yours, or Yours truly.


The first word of a closing is always capitalized while the second is not.
Align to the left for block format. For modified block, tab to the center and begin typing (so it justifies right). For semi-block, fully center your closing.Other options include: Respectfully, Very truly yours, Regards, and Cordially., After your closing, hit the enter bar four times to leave space for a signature. After that, type your first name, last name and any credentials. Your title can be included underneath your name.


When signing your name, use blue or black ink.
Your signature should begin over the first letter of your typed name., End notations are used for any additional information such as initials or enclosures. The information should be placed on the left margin, two spaces below the signature information.


Initials are included if someone other than the author of the letter types it. The author's initials come first (in capital letters), follow by a colon or forward slash, and the typist's initials in lowercase letters.Enclosures are any other items that are being sent with the letter. It is signified by the word ""Enclosures"" or the abbreviation ""Enc."" or ""Encs."" as necessary. If there are multiple enclosures, it is customary to signify this by putting the number of enclosures in parenthesis: Enclosures (3)., The tone is known as the writer's attitude or feeling towards the writing.It's important to have a professional tone throughout the letter because it reflects both the writer and the organization.


Be courteous and sincere in your writing by using phrases such as ""thank you,"" or ""please feel free to contact me.""
Never use a condescending tone--even if the information is negative. For example, instead of saying, ""You did not read the instructions carefully,"" instead say, ""the system may shut down if the instructions are not properly followed."", Don't use any type of generalizations or language that others could find offensive. Use non-gender specific titles for generalizations and avoid stereotypical statements.


For example, use chairperson instead of chairman or say,""the office staff"" versus ""the girls in the office."", Use complete and complex sentences and avoid fragments and run-ons. Always re-read to make sure your sentences are cohesive and well put together.Don't use slang terms or lower level words, no matter how popular they are. For example avoid using words such as: stuff, like, or really.
Avoid overly used words such as: a lot, good, or nice.
Don't use run-on sentences that seem to have no end and require punctuation but don't use any and put together many ideas into one sentence that should be broken up into a few. (This is an example of a run-on sentence)
Make sure your sentences. (are complete and not fragments like this one).

, This includes punctuation and spelling. When in doubt, utilize your spelling and grammar checker in your word processing system.


Don't use shorthand such as LOL (laugh out loud) or TTYL (talk to you later).
Avoid using excessive punctuation marks!!!!!!

Say why you're writing and what you're applying for in the first sentences.,
Explain why you are the best candidate.,
Keep the tone professional.,
Explain how both parties will benefit from your selection.,
Do some research.",How to Write an Application Letter1," Don't let anyone who picks up your letter be confused about what they're reading. The very first things that someone should read should let them know what this letter is, and how they should read it.


A good example would be: ""I'm writing to apply for the Chimney Sweep position advertised in Rolling Stone. I think my experience in the heating industry makes me uniquely qualified for this position. Please find my application materials and a brief description of my qualifications below.""
Don't write your name until the signature. It'll be in the header and in the sign-off, so there's no reason to put it in the body of the letter itself.;
, What's unique about you? What do you bring to the table? What will you be able to do for this company, better than any other applicant? A good application letter will stand out form the pack.


Be specific. Who are you? Where do you come from? What's your story? These details are important. HR screeners read hundreds of these.
Describe your ambitions. Where do you want to go? How will this opportunity help you get there?
What skills and experiences make you the right fit? Be as specific as possible and avoid vague language. It's better to describe a time you solved a specific problem at your last job than to just write, ""I'm a good problem solver at work.""

, When you're applying for employment, it's important to keep the tone focused on the skills and experiences that make you qualified for employment at the business. It should be less the story of your life and more the reason that you'll be a good employee for the business. Use specific examples to make yourself stand out.


Tailor it to the business. If you're applying to work at a record store, you need to talk about music. If you're applying to work at a tech company that writes, ""Tell us something totally rad about yourself!"" it's probably ok to be a little more informal.

, What's at stake in this decision? What will you bring to the table? How will the business or school benefit from having you around? Imagine yourself going to work there, and describe specifically what you can do to help.


Don't over-promise. Telling someone that you can guarantee that you'll be able to turn around their sales figures in six months or less is a good way to get fired in six months.

, If you want to stand out from the other applicants, do a little research into the history of the business to which you're applying. What do they do? What is their basic business philosophy? What direction is the business moving in?


Any kind of job requires this type of research. If you apply to a restaurant, you need to be familiar with the menu and the kind of customers the restaurant attracts. Consider eating there a few times before you apply.
Don't show you're familiar by criticizing a business and telling them what you can do better. Not the time to offer a harsh criticism of a business plan that you don't really know anything about.

Begin your letter with an engaging opening.,
Think of your letter like an essay.,
Keep the body of your letter interesting.",How to Write an Effective Letter1," If you think of your letter like an essay, the logical first step would be to craft an opening line or paragraph that will catch the reader’s attention, while also briefly outlining the letter’s purpose.


Creative openings are the best way to catch a reader’s attention. Rather than just opening with a discussion about the weather, try something more interesting. It’s unlikely you really started that letter to tell someone about the weather!;
, You probably have written essays before, and you probably opened them with an idea that was related to the purpose of the essay. Try to do the same with a letter.


You must have a purpose for writing, so rather than meandering around the point, just come out with it!

, If you opened your letter and got right to the point, then use the body of your letter to elaborate on that point.


Maybe the purpose for writing the letter is to apply for a particular job. You will want to keep the body of your letter clear and concise, but also interesting and engaging.
If you are still thinking of your letter like an essay, your opening being where you stated your purpose, then your body should be where you would logically “back up” your point, or elaborate on the idea you first brought up."

Address the prompt.,
Tell your story.,
Write about your future.,
Don't include stuff that's also on your resume.,
Demonstrate that you're familiar with the school you're applying to.",How to Write an Application Letter2," If you're writing for a college application or an internship, there will almost always be a short prompt for you to respond to. These are often quite short, which means you'll have some room to get creative.


Common prompts include things like, ""Outline your qualifications for this position"" or ""In writing, explain how this position would affect your career goals."" Sometimes, the prompt will be as short as, ""Tell us something interesting about yourself.""If there is no prompt, but you still feel the need to introduce your application with a letter, it's usually best to keep it as short as possible. Explain what you're applying for, why you're applying, and thank the contact for their consideration. That's it.

, College applications are a unique opportunity to make yourself stand out beyond the numbers of your resume and your transcript. Lots of applicants think the letter should make them sound ""smart,"" but it's better to stand out and make yourself unique. What makes you the unique person you are? Don't worry if it sounds ""smart,"" worry that it makes you memorable.


Often, college prompts will ask you to describe a time you struggled, or a time you overcame some obstacle. Write about something unique, a time that you actually failed and dealt with the consequences.
The board will get thousands–literally, thousands–of letters about someone's first mission trip, and letters about the time someone's sports team was beaten, then overcame the odds, and won again. Avoid these topics.

, Where do you want to go next? Employers and college admissions want to hire people who want to succeed and want to go places. If you're writing an application letter, it's important to stand out by describing that you're an ambitious person who'll achieve at a high level. Describe where you want to go.


Be specific. If you're writing to a college board, don't say, ""I want to go to this college because I need a degree."" That's obvious. What do you want to do with it? Why? If you're applying to a business, don't say, ""I just need a job."" That's obvious. Why this specific job?

, Your application letter is your one chance in an application to stand out. Listing off the number from your GPA and the boring list of achievements from your resume isn't the best way to do that. The purpose of the letter is to get a sense of who you are, not a list of accomplishments. Don't use the letter to describe the list of schools you've attended, your GPAs, and a list of extra-curricular activities, unless it relates to some anecdote in the letter., Lots of people carpet-bomb the same letter to a bunch of different places, because that's a lot easier than actually writing a separate letter to every place you're applying. Research a little bit about each place, and take some time to make each letter unique, even if you're going from a template.


If you're applying to schools, what do you like about the school? What faculty are you interested in? Why this school, instead of another?

Keep it short.,
Only address the letter if you have someone to address it to.,
Use a standard font.,
Use a formal closing.,
Put your contact information in the header.",How to Write an Application Letter3," Cover letters should not be longer than one page, single-spaced. In most cases, you should get some kind of word-count to shoot for, which may be shorter or longer, depending on the purpose of the letter. Always defer to the guidelines you receive.


If you don't get a word-count guideline, just focus on making one or two good points about yourself, and keeping it at that. No need to drone on four several pages.

, Addressing letters to, ""All concerned"" or ""Sir or Madam"" makes your letter look strange and like a computer wrote it. If you're applying, but don't know who is going to read it, leave off the salutation at the beginning and title the document instead, so it will be clear.


Instead of a salutation, write, ""Letter of Application"" at the top left corner of the page, or put it in the header on the left side at the top.
If you do have a contact, address it to them, making sure the name is spelled correctly. Then space down and start the body of the letter.

, Cover letters should always be word processed and single-spaced. Use a normal, standard font, like Calibri or Times New Roman. Avoid childish looking or gimmicky fonts, like Comic Sans when you're applying for jobs and school applications.

, When you get to the end of your letter, add a space, then include a closing, like ""Sincerely"" and sign your name.


Sometimes, it's appropriate to type your name, then print out the letter and sign it in pen. That can be a nice touch., The following contact information should be included in the header of the document, usually over to the right margin:


Your name
Mailing address
E-mail
Telephone and/or fax number

Think of your letter like a story.,
Spend some time discussing what is going on in your life.,
Have fun writing your letter.,
Write things you want your recipient to remember and keep.",How to Write an Effective Letter2," The body of the letter does not need to be especially rigid or too straightforward, but rather more relaxed and friendly. Use figurative language and imagery. Paint a picture for the recipient of your letter like an author might do for a reader.


When telling a story in your letter, be imaginative with your writing. Be descriptive, and even use dialogue if you want to. Allow the scene you are relaying to come through like an image.In January of 1960, Queen Elizabeth wrote a letter to President Eisenhower. She used a specific image to convey the purpose of her letter by writing, “Seeing a picture of you in today’s newspaper standing in front of a barbecue grilling quail, reminded me that I had never sent you the recipe of the drop scones which I promised you at Balmoral.”, Once you have gotten to the point and elaborated on or explained that point, you can always spend a few sentences catching your reader up on what has been going on in your life.


If your recipient is a friend or family member that lives far away, you might let them know how your other friends and family members are doing.
An actual letter from a friend or family member from far away is an easy, simple way to make their day a bit better. We have come to rely on technology so much that most of us probably do not send snail mail very often, so sending or receiving a letter is fun and different. It can help people far away from us feel more connected to us and our lives.If something especially interesting has happened in your life lately, let your recipient know! Tell them exciting news about your career, your love life, or even about recent travels you took. Just try to avoid discussing anything negatively—especially another person. Letters are permanent documents that your recipients could keep for any period of time. You don’t want to write anything that might come back to bite you later. If you have something negative to vent, say it out loud.

, If you use your letter as a medium for creativity and imagination, it will feel just as fun to write it as it will for your recipient to read it.

, Rather than simply having a conversation, a letter is more permanent. It is a physical artifact of your relationship with another person, and that makes it very special.

Think of a hook.,
Write a letter you would want to receive.,
Try keeping to a central theme or idea.,
Close your letter with a recap of your initial thoughts.",How to Write an Effective Letter3," Regardless of if your letter is formal or informal, it’s always a good idea to immediately grab your reader’s attention and get them interested.Some interesting ways to hook your reader might be with a quote, a metaphor (probably related to the point you will be making/information you will be reporting in the letter), or even an anecdote.
Some of the best cover letters for job applications and even college entrance letters are ones that open with a memorable hook.
Let your recipient know that you are looking forward to talking to them, or seeing them, again. It’s a simple and straightforward way to end a letter, and it lets them know that even after writing and sending the letter, you are still thinking of them, and missing them.

, If you read your letter over and find yourself bored with your own writing, you might want to start again.


Don’t feel like you have to be too formal, especially if you are writing to a friend or family member. Be light-hearted, honest, and engaging. Throw in some inside jokes, if you want! A letter is, after all, just another form of communication.

, Like a good story, a good letter does not meander around too terribly much. Instead, it has at least a loose focus on a certain purpose, idea, or thought. Maybe this is the thought, idea, or purpose that first made you sit down to write, or maybe it is one that you came across as your thoughts unfolded while writing.


If you do not have a single reason for writing—maybe you just felt like writing to that person—that is alright, too. Let them know that! It’s never a bad idea to let someone know you were thinking of them. If a friend moved away and you promised to write, do it! Doing rather than simply saying is an easy way to show someone you care.On the other hand, if you do have a specific reason for writing, keep it in mind as you write. If you start a letter saying something like, “I have something really important to tell you” and then skip to talking about the nice walk you went on today, your recipient might get a little anxious to find out what that important thing is.

, Look again at your first paragraph and tie on something from that to close your letter.


Like an essay or even a story, the ending is just as important as the beginning! The ending will be the lasting thought left for your recipient, so try to make it something interesting or impactful.
In a letter to her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald closed by saying, “I walked on those telephone wires for two hours after holding your love like a parasol to balance me.”If you are writing a love letter, go all out! Use poetic language and a lasting image to leave your recipient with something to remember.

You typically can find a business letter template on any word processing application.If you have letterhead, you may want to use it for a more professional touch.;
, Whoever you're writing to request an appeal may have specific information they require on all appeals. They also may have a specific form you must use. Find these out before you write your letter so you don't have to go back and make changes later.You may be able to find this information online or you may have to call somebody in the office. Typically it's better for you if you can get the information in writing, so you can make sure you're including everything.

, On a business letter, the date usually is somewhere at the top of the letter. This date should be the date you wrote the letter. Your word processing application may automatically enter the day's date., Do your best to address your letter to a specific person. If you can't get a specific name, at least use a specific job title. As a last resort, address your letter ""To Whom It May Concern.""""Dear Dr. Drew"" is an appropriate salutation. Include the individual's title if it is important or relevant to your appeal. For example, if you're writing to the Dean to request an appeal from a suspension, ""Dear Dean Drew"" would be appropriate.

, After you've finished typing your letter, you'll print it up and sign it by hand. Leave at least four lines for your signature, and then type your name below the space.You may want to include preferred contact information under your name, such as your phone number or email address.

, You likely will have documents or other information to back up the statements you make in your appeal letter. Use traditional business formatting to list these attachments on the letter itself, so your recipient can confirm they got everything., Start your appeal letter by taking one sentence – two at most – to tell the person reading the letter who you are and your relation to the situation at hand. Keep it brief, and don't include any information that isn't relevant to the appeal.For example, if you are a student appealing an academic suspension, your first sentence might read: ""My name is Katie Parker. I am a junior here at State Tech who has been on the Dean's list three out of my most recent five semesters.""
If you are writing the appeal letter on behalf of someone else, include information about them as well in the first sentence or two.

, The opening paragraph of your letter essentially is a summary of your appeal. It's a good idea either to outline your letter first, or to write your appeal and then come back to this summary.Use the opening paragraph to briefly describe the decision that you want to appeal and the incident that led up to it. Close your opening paragraph with a sentence that tells the reader exactly what you want to happen.
To continue the previous example, the rest of Katie's opening paragraph might read: ""Last semester I was placed on academic suspension, despite the fact that my overall GPA was a B. Since this violates school policy, the suspension should be removed from my record.""

, After your opening paragraph, start a new paragraph and tell your reader exactly what happened that led up to the decision you want to appeal. Provide as many specific details as you can.Make a note of facts you list that you can back up with documentation. The more evidence you have to support your case, the more likely your appeal will be granted.
Keep emotion and appeals to sympathy. Avoid passive voice, which can make it look like you're trying to evade responsibility for your actions.

, Once you've told the story, start a new paragraph to explain to your reader how the decision you described was wrong. Provide copies of rules or policies that back up your interpretation of the situation.If you made mistakes or violated rules yourself, acknowledge them. Describe the surrounding circumstances if they're relevant, but don't make excuses. Own up to your actions.
If relevant, describe how you've grown or changed as a result of the entire incident. Particularly in an academic setting, you can prove yourself worthy of a second chance if you demonstrate sincere personal growth.

, In the final paragraph of your appeal letter, tell the reader your desired outcome. Keep it as simple and straightforward as possible. Avoid making outlandish threats, or any promises you don't intend to follow through on.For example, you may have the opportunity to file a lawsuit if your appeal isn't resolved to your satisfaction. But unless you've already talked to a lawyer and plan to file a lawsuit, leave a threat of legal action out of your appeal letter.

, Any appeal has a greater chance of success if all the facts are thoroughly documented. The type of documentation you'll need depends on what kind of decision you're appealing.Go through your letter with a highlighter and highlight all facts – dates, places, names. Then ask yourself if you have any proof of that fact. If you do, include it.
You'll also want to include identification documentation, as well as anything that connects you to the recipient, such as a membership card or a student ID. Make copies of these rather than sending your originals.

, You run the risk that your appeal will not be taken seriously if your letter is riddled with typos and grammatical errors. Read your letter aloud to pick up on additional errors or awkward phrasing.Go back and check the date on the letter, especially if you've been drafting it over the course of several days. That date doesn't necessarily have to be the date you mail it, but it should reflect the date you signed the letter.
You also want to check your notations for attachments and make sure everything you've included is listed.

, After you've signed your letter, make a copy of it along with a copy of every attachment. You'll want to keep these for your own records, at least until the issue is resolved.You may want to make a separate folder just for this incident. Keep all documents and information related to your appeal until the matter is concluded.

, You want to mail your letter rather than taking it in person so you have proof of receipt. Use certified mail that will require a signature and send you a receipt. Even if you never end up filing a lawsuit, the date your appeal was received may end up being important.For example, suppose you get a notice saying your appeal wasn't received within 20 days of the decision. If you have a certified mail receipt that shows the letter was received 10 days after the decision, you can have your appeal heard.

, Once you mail your letter, mark a date on your calendar within about a week to contact the recipient if you haven't heard from them yet. Since you're the one requesting a second chance, be an active participant in the process and show that it means something to you.Following up doesn't mean being a pest. Call once and find out if they've received the letter. Ask what their timeline is or when you should expect to hear back, and plan accordingly.
If they request more information or other documentation, submit what they need as quickly as possible.

Account for a formal apology.",How to Write an Apology Letter," It’s a good idea to begin by letting them know that this letter is an apology. This will give them the chance to put themselves, emotionally, in the right place to read the rest of your letter. You don’t want them to be confused about why you’re writing or what you’re going to say.


Say something like: “I wanted to write you a letter to apologize”.

, Now that you’ve acknowledged that you’re apologizing, say what you’re apologizing for and why it was incorrect. Be very exact and descriptive. By fully putting it out there in the open, the person that you’re apologizing to will know that you do really understand what you did.


Say something like: “What I did last weekend was horribly inappropriate, disrespectful, and wildly selfish. Your wedding is supposed to be all about your happiness and celebrating your love. By proposing to Jessica, I turned that focus on to me. I tried to steal your moment and that was wrong.”

, Acknowledge that they have been hurt and that you understand just how hurtful it was. This is usually a good time to also mention that you never intended for them to be hurt.


Say something like: “Jacob told me that my actions ruined not only your experience of your wedding, but also are now making your honeymoon less than the incredible experience that it should be. I hope you understand that that was never my intention. I wanted you to be able to look back on this time and remember only happy things but I have ruined that with my selfish actions. I've robbed you of those happy memories. While I can't truly know how this feels to you, I can certainly understand that what I did was one of the worst things I could possibly have done to you.”

, If you want to, though it is not required, you can acknowledge all the hard work and good things that they've done for you in the past. This shows them that you appreciate them and can help show that you really do feel bad about what you've done.


Say something like: “This is an especially terrible thing for me to have done to you after how warmly you have accepted me into your family. You have not only shown your incredible, beautiful love to my brother, but you have also shown me support and kindness that I never could have possibly expected. To hurt you in this way was an insult to all the things that you have done for me and I hate myself for that.”

, This is one of the most important parts of an apology but can be the hardest to say. Even if the other person did make some mistakes, acknowledgement of that does not belong in this letter. What you do need to do is admit your responsibility for your mistake openly and without reservation. You might have had good reasons for doing what you did but that shouldn't keep you from saying that your actions caused someone to get hurt.


Say something like: “I would try to offer an explanation for what I did, but there are no excuses. My intentions, though good, don't matter here: only my poor choices. I absolutely take responsibility for my selfish actions and the terrible pain I have caused you.”
Don't make excuses for your actions but you can explain your reasoning very carefully. If you really feel like it's needed or would make the situation better, you can explain why you made the choice that you made. This should be done only if you think understanding your choices would give the person you hurt some comfort.

, Just saying that you're sorry isn't really enough. What really gives an apology some punch is finding a way to solve the problem in the future. This is better, even, than just saying that it will never happen again. When you offer a plan for change and how you're going to go about it, this shows the person that you're really serious about making the situation better.


Say something like: “But just being sorry isn't enough. You deserve better. When you come home, Jessica and I would love to throw a big welcome-home party in your honor. This will be the party to end all parties and it will be 100% devoted to celebrating the incredible love you share with my brother. If you would rather not do this, that's fine: I just want to find some way to help you create the incredible, happy memories that I took away from you. ”

, You shouldn't just outright ask for forgiveness. This places demands, whether you intend it or not, on a person whom you have already wronged. It is better to express what you really want, which is for the two of you to interact in a better way in the future.


Say something like: “I can’t expect your forgiveness, though I certainly hope for it. All I can say is that I truly want things to be okay between us. I want you to feel okay and eventually even happy when you're around me. I want to earn back the wonderful relationship that we had. Hopefully, in the future, we can find a way to move past this and create happier times together.”

, This is very important. If you made a mistake that you feel you are likely to repeat or that stems from inherent differences in personality or values, you do not want to promise them that you will change. This is because you will likely make the mistake again and future apologies, for anything really, will ring hollow.

, Apologizing is a skill. We naturally don't want to do it and will fight against it a lot of the time. This is why, if you want to apologize correctly, you'll want to be careful about your language. Some phrases and words sound like an apology but actually make the situation worse because they show that you really aren't sorry. It's easy to use these words by accident, so be conscious as you're writing your letter. Examples include:


""Mistakes were made...""
""If"" statements like ""I'm sorry if your feelings got hurt"" or ""If you felt bad about this...""
""I'm sorry that you felt that way.""

, When you apologize, you need to be sincere and genuine about it. If you can't be, in some cases it might be better to wait until you really are sorry before apologizing. When you write your letter, skip the form language and cliches. Don't just copy some letter that you find on the internet. You want what you say to be specific to your situation so that the person you're apologizing to knows that you really understand what happened and why it was bad.

, You don't want your letter to sound demanding, rude, or create further insult. You don't want to try to or appear to try to guilt someone into forgiveness. You don't want to make assumptions about how they feel or why they're upset, because you might end up showing how little you understand about what happened. With all of the language you use, it's better to take a tone that is humble and leaves them feeling in control of the situation. This sort of language is most likely to help them forgive you.

, If possible, wait a few days before sending your letter. You want to be able to read it when you're a little more emotionally removed from what you wrote.

, With an apology, you'll want to start your letter with the usual ""Dear,....."" It is better not to get flowery with your language at the start of the letter and to keep the salutation as basic as possible.

, If you don't know how else to end your letter, default to the basic ""Sincerely..."" However, you can also get a little more creative if you want to keep the letter sounding less like a basic letter. Try phrases like ""I sincerely thank you for hearing me out"" or ""Again, I deeply apologize for the problems my actions caused, and I hope I can work to make it right.""

, If you're writing an apology letter in a professional or formal setting, then you're going to need to be sure that the letter looks formal. Aside from having it nicely printed, you should also add things like the date, your name, the name of your organization, your written signature, and other formatting associated with a formal letter as needed.


You'll also need to adjust the syntax of your letter to sound formal and better fit the situation.

Mail the thank you note.",How to Write a Thank You Note for Money," If you do not have a supply of thank you cards, you will need to go buy a pack. There are a few things to keep in mind:Choose a pack that fits either your personality or the occasion. If you are thanking someone for money given for funeral expenses, for example, you will not want a brightly-colored thank you card. However, that type of card would be acceptable for thanking someone for money given for graduation or a birthday.Buy a pack large enough to send as many thank you notes as you need. Packs of thank you cards usually come in sets of 8-10, but you can also find packs of 20 and 50.
Pay attention to whether the thank you cards have pre-printed messages inside them. Most packs are blank, so be sure to check whether the pack you chose is blank. You may want the pre-printed message, or you may want the blank ones.

, You need only a few things, but having them gathered together helps you avoid having to stop and start while writing your note.


Thank you cards and envelopes
Pens
Address book
Stamps
Return address labels

, If you look through your address book and discover that you do not have your recipient's address, figure out a way to obtain it.


Contact the recipient and ask for it
Contact a family member or friend who knows it
Look in other address books or documents to try to find it

, You may only be writing one thank you note, or you might be writing several thank you notes, if more than one person gifted money to you. Find a space in your home where it is comfortable to sit and write for a while., Make sure that you are comfortable and that you have everything you need to write your note.

, The date goes in the top right-hand corner of the inside of the card. You can write the date in a couple of different formats:


January 1, 2015
1 January 2015
1/1/15
01/01/15
1/1/2015
01/01/2015

, Shift your hand down just a bit from where you wrote the date, and then slide your hand across to the left side. Here is where you should write your greeting. The formality of it will vary depending on who your recipient is; a friend or family member can have a less formal greeting, while a boss, donor, or other important person would need a more formal one.


“Dear Susie,”
“Dear Mr. Brown,”
“Dear Mr. and Mrs. Thomas,”
“Hi Jonathan,”
“Hey Michelle!”
“Hello Mrs. Smith,”

, After you write your greeting, shift your hand downward again and indent about an inch from the left. This is where you will start the first sentence of your card.


Be mindful of the size of your handwriting. Unless you write quite small, most thank you cards can only fit about 3-5 sentences, not including the date, greeting, and closing.

, As you are thanking someone for giving you money, it is important to thank them for their generosity and/or thoughtfulness, express your gratitude, explain how you will use or save the money, and continue your connection with the recipient.“Thank you for the money that you gave me for graduation. I'm so thankful that you made this investment in my future. I'll be putting the money into my savings account to cover college expenses. I'll be home for Thanksgiving, so I hope to see you then.”
“I want to thank you for sending me money for Christmas. That was so generous of you, and it completely surprised me. I'm planning to use the money to buy a dress I really want. Thanks for giving me the means to buy another gift! I hope we can get together at New Years.”
“There just aren't enough words to express how thankful I am for the money you sent me. I've been in a tight spot for a while now, and the money you unexpectedly sent me will help so much in covering some expenses I have right now. I'm so grateful to have someone like you in my life. I'm planning to host a small dinner party in a few weeks, and I'd love it if you could attend.”
“We want to send our sincerest thanks for the money you thoughtfully gave us as a wedding gift. We are saving to buy our first home, so we will contribute this money to that savings fund. Thank you for helping us get one step closer to our goal! We'll let you know when we accomplish it.”, Once you finish writing your message, slide your hand down the card a bit and move it somewhere between the middle and the right side of the card. This is where you will write your closing. Again, which closing you choose depends on how formal or informal you need to be.


“Love, Nate”
“Sincerely, Emily Jones”
“Your friend, Bob”
“Warmly, Kristen”
“Talk to you soon, Ryan”
“Thanks again, Lindsey”

, Then, seal the flap of the envelope. You can lick it, or you might want to use a dampened sponge or an envelope moistener.

, In neat handwriting on the front of the envelope, write the recipient's address. It is important to include all parts of the address, including the zip code.


If the note is going to more than one person, be sure to address it as “Mr. and Mrs. Thomas,” for example. Other options include “Dr. and Mrs.,” “Dr. and Dr.,” “Rev. and Mrs.,” and “The Thomas Family.”

, The return address label belongs in the top left-hand corner of the front of the envelope. In the top right-hand corner is where you should stick the stamp.

, It is important to mail your thank you note in a timely manner. Etiquette usually implies that you have up to two weeks to send a thank you note for most occasions.


Weddings have a slightly different rule. If you receive the gift prior to the wedding, then the 2-week rule applies. However, if you received the gift at or after the wedding, then etiquette allows up to one month after your return from your honeymoon."

Deliver the Thank You Note.",How to Write a Thank You Note to a Teacher2," Brainstorm and write down memories or words that come to mind when you think of this teacher. Use this time to organize your thoughts and really get to the heart of what you want to thank this teacher for, and why. Think about:


Your child’s experience in this class and any positive things they told you about this teacher.
Your own interactions with this teacher. What positive experiences have you had?
What you know about this teacher. What is this person like?
What words would you use to describe this person to someone else?
What might this teacher write in a Thank You Note to you, if they were to?

, Hand written notes add a personal touch that is often more treasured than a computer typed document. Office supply stores are a great way to find cheap stationary. Some stores also sell packs that include decorated cards and matching envelopes.


You can also use blank paper! This gives you and your child an opportunity to add artwork later. Personal art work is just as appreciated, if not more so, than stationary.

, Start with “Dear _____,” It is always better to err on the side of professionalism when writing to a teacher. Address the teacher by the same name that students use.


Say “Dear Mrs. Smith,” instead of “Hey, Diane!”

, Look back at the notes you made in step one to help you write your letter. Use words you are comfortable with and keep your sentences short. There is no need to feel like you should use flowery language. Say what’s on your mind. Try things like:


Thank you for an incredible year!
My son/daughter learned so much from you (you can include specific examples here if you have any)
We really appreciate (give a specific example of something the teacher did, or a fun memory you share)

, Think about ways you can customize this letter so that it couldn’t be for anyone else besides this specific teacher. Take the opportunity to be gracious. Even if you didn’t particularly get along with this teacher, there must be something specific you can praise them for.


If you and your student loved this teacher, sum up your positive experiences into just a few sentences like, “James really enjoyed the board game project. He still plays the board game he made in your class, even today.”
If you and your student had a frustrating year with this teacher, strive to find the things they did well, and thank them for those things specifically. You may be able to say something like, “Thank-you for all the extra time you spent with Maria on her math homework. She has always struggled with math and she has learned a lot from your class.”

, Thank the teacher again and sign your name. Add a formality to your signature like:


Sincerely
With Kind regards
Warmest regards
Yours truly
Best regards
Our deepest thanks

, No matter what grade your child is in, they can help add an additional personal touch to your letter. Individual drawings or artwork are great suggestions. A separate Thank You Note or phrase written by your child is also great. You can also help your child gather some cut outs from classroom received material to color, decorate, sign and include.


If your child is in Elementary School, help them write a short thank you (about ½ a page) at the best of their writing abilities. Or, if you’ve got an artist on your hands, help inspire them. Suggest they draw a portrait of their teacher, or pictures of things they remember from the class. Doodles are great too!
If your student is in Middle school or High school, help them write ½ to 1 page about their favorite memory from that class.
If your child has special needs, help them write notes or draw pictures to the best of their ability.Decorate the card with them using stickers or glitter. You can also draw a picture for them to decorate.

, If you decide to include a gift, make sure to keep it small. Don’t spend a lot of money. There are a lot of great gift ideas for Thank You cards that don’t cost very much. Try:


Flowers. If you know a great place to pick wildflowers, you can arrange a bouquet with your child and present them to the teacher. Or, you can go to a local nursery and select a plant. You may want to consider a plant that thrives indoors. You may also want to include a self-watering pot or a small vase with your plant.
A goodie bag. Find a high quality tote bag from a bookstore or office supply store and work together with your child to fill the bag with goodies. You can include highlighters, post-its, etc.
Gift cards. What teacher wouldn’t appreciate a gift card to Starbucks? Make sure to keep the card value reasonable. $10-$20 is good.

, You can send the card in the mail, but delivering it by hand is great too!

Deliver your letter.",How to Write a Thank You Note to a Teacher3," If you can, a hand written note will likely be more appreciated. However, if you have ended the semester, graduated, or are unsure how to find your teacher again, you can type the letter and email it.

, Think about how this teacher made a difference in your life and what you want to thank them for specifically. Make a list of words to describe your experience with this teacher.


Keep your letter sincere and light.
Avoid stating the obvious or being redundant. You don’t need to say why you are writing the letter.
Avoid saying things like, “I’m writing to thank you for…”
Just thank them!

, Begin your letter with a formal hello to your teacher. Address them the same way you would in class. If you have established a first name relationship with them, use that name in your letter.


Saying “Dear” instead of “Hey” or “Hi” is more professional and respectful.
You may want to write your letter on a nice piece of stationary. You can purchase stationary for a cheap price at Target or any office supply store., Take a few sentences to simply tell your teacher, plain and simple, why you are thanking them. Using specific examples and instances will make your letter more powerful and personal. Include phrases like:


You really helped me understand when I was struggling.
Thank you for encouraging me when I was struggling.
You’re class taught me how to be a better student.
Thank you for your patience.
You helped me see what I could be.
You are the best teacher ever!
I will never forget you.

, Express to them how their class really impacted you. Often teachers go home wondering what, if anything, their students retained from their lecture. Tell your teacher how they matter. At the end of the day, everyone wants to be appreciated for their hard work.


If your professor inspired you to seek out more education in their subject, tell them!
Whether you are your teacher were best friends, or had your share if differences, they still performed a service for you. Let them know that you are grateful.

, Express to your teacher how much you would enjoy networking with them in the future. Invite them to contact you and offer methods for them to do so.

, Thank your teacher again and sign your name. Include your contact information if you would like to keep in touch. Add a formality to your signature like:


Sincerely

Warmest regards
Yours truly
Best regards
Our deepest thanks

, Hand deliver your letter if possible. You may also be able to leave the letter in your teachers mailbox on campus, or mail it directly. If you have no other choice, email your letter.


If emailing your letter, make sure to use a recognizable email address (like a campus email if possible) and write a clear subject line like, “Thank You Note from Eric.”
If your teacher doesn't recognize your email, they may not open it.

Add an inspiring quote.,
Include a joke.,
Tell a story.",How to Write a Thank You Note to a Teacher4," If you are writing a Thank You Note to an English or History professor, this is an especially great idea. Include a quote from the classroom reading that stuck with you.

, Make fun of something you learned in class. Target your joke to the subject matter. Or, include a fun memory you have of that particular class.

, Reminisce with your teacher about what the first day of class was like or how you felt before and after a difficult exam. Let them see their class from your point of view in an encouraging way. If your perception of them changed over time, in an uplifting way, express this to them.

Keep a list of gifts.,
Do not procrastinate.,
Address the recipient.,
State the purpose for writing.,
Name the gift item specifically.,
Explain how you felt when opening the gift.,
Mention how the gift has been or will be used.,
Write about your Christmas experience.,
Ask about the gift giver’s Christmas.,
Make plans for future contact.,
Thank the giver again.,
End the note appropriately.,
Sign your name.This may not be your full legal name.,
Mail the note promptly.",How to Write a Thank You Note for a Christmas Gift," When you receive presents for any event, be sure that you or someone else keeps track of what gifts are received and who sent each one.This will make it much easier to sit down and write thank you notes.

, While receiving a note in the mail at any time can be well-received, it is best to send thank you notes between one day and two weeks after opening a gift.If you wait longer than that, the person may think that you were rude for not sending a note. However, you may also want to follow the old adage of, “better late than never.”

, Most notes and letters begin with the word “Dear” followed by the person’s name and a comma; for example: “Dear Julian,”


You may also want to use a nickname or a relationship name, such as “Dear Mom” or “Dear Junior.”

, Tell the person that you are writing in order to thank them for the gift that they gave you for Christmas. You will likely start out your note by saying “thank you,” but you could also get more creative and relate the “scene” for someone who was not there.


An example of a standard opening might be, “I am writing to thank you for the gift you sent for Christmas.”
A less traditional approach may be “Christmas morning, the whole family crept downstairs. The house was nearly silent until the children started squealing with glee as they saw that there, waiting for everyone, were shiny new bicycles for the entire family!”

, Be sure to explicitly state what gift the person gave you. This will communicate to them that you are aware of their specific contribution.


If you lost track of the gifts and are not sure, it’s better to be vague and say “thank you for your kind gift” than to state the incorrect item.
If you received a gift of money, you may want to say something like “thank you so much for your generosity.”

, Use specific, descriptive language when relating how you felt when you received the gift on Christmas morning. This will make your note come to life for the reader.


For example, you might say, “I was still feeling sleepy and frustrated because our coffee pot broke again. Then I opened your gift, and saw a shiny, new programmable coffee pot, and my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.""
Another example would be, “the children were so excited to open their matching PJs. I had them open the boxes at the same time, and I was so proud to see them hold them up and talk to each other about the excitement of wearing them to bed that very night.”

, Make the gift giver feel successful by explaining how useful or nice their gift has been.For example, tell her that your new coffee pot makes the best coffee you’ve ever had and that the programmable feature makes you feel pampered.
For an item that you haven’t used yet, such as an article of clothing, explain when you plan to use or wear it. For example, “I can’t wait to wear the sparkly black sweater out to the neighborhood New Year’s Eve party.”
For an extra special touch, consider including a photo of the gift in use., After focusing on the gift, it is nice to give an overview of how you spent the rest of the day on Christmas.This is particularly good if you are sending a note to someone that you did not get to spend time with on Christmas.


For example, you might say, “After opening presents, we made our traditional Christmas morning breakfast of cinnamon rolls and fresh-squeezed orange juice, then we went for a walk in the snow” or “We are exhausted from having 4 different Christmases in one day: we had our family morning at home, then went to my parents’ house, then went to my husband’s mom’s house, and then finally my husband’s father’s house. We need a break from Christmas break!”

, Even though a thank you note is a type of one-way correspondence, it is nice to inquire after (or at least comment on) the person’s Christmas. Try to make this as personal as possible.


For example, “How was your Christmas? Did you enjoy the Christmas cruise as much as you thought you would?”
Another example would be, “I hope you had an enjoyable Christmas, filled with love and laughter.”

, If you plan to visit the person who sent the gift, or if she plans to visit you, mention that you are looking forward to the upcoming visit. If it’s unlikely that you will see the person soon, express a desire to talk on the phone or write letters in the future.


For example, “I can’t wait to see you in February; it has been far too long!” or “I hope to hear back from you soon; feel free to call or write any time!”

, This can be a simple “thank you again for the gift,” but this gesture will remind the reader of your note why you wrote to them in the first place.


This step may be skipped if your closing (in the next step) is “with gratitude” or “thanks again.”

, Your relationship with the gift giver will help determine the appropriate closing before your signature. Close friends or relatives may be signed “Love, . Other options are: “best wishes,” “sincerely,” “warmly,” “best,” “thanks again,” or “with gratitude.”

, If you are writing a letter to your child, you might sign it with “Mom,” for example. If the person generally calls you by just your first name or a nickname, it is appropriate to sign that name. You may wish to sign your full name, however, when writing letters to acquaintances or co-workers.

, Place the note in an envelope, write the recipient’s address on the outside of the envelope (be sure the address is current), put the appropriate postage on the envelope, and put the note in the mail.

This is literally presenting yourself to them as a product, considering your potential employer as the target market. Essentially, a value proposition is a statement that you use to compel potential employers to hire you by telling them that you have the solution to their problem.;
, Your value proposition letter is intended to set you apart from your competition. However, it will only do this if it is well written and presented in an organized way.


Since the letter outlines your skills, work ethics and traits, it sets you apart from others during the interview process because you have more to talk about than what was written on your resume. Instead, you get to focus on how the company will benefit by hiring you.
The letter focuses on your value by demonstrating how you will apply your skills to the job opportunity at hand and what financial value you can add to the current functions. Many times a hiring manager is not just looking for someone to fill the position, but is looking for someone who fits into the company culture.
A good value proposition letter demonstrates that you understand the hiring process really well and know exactly what the hiring manager is looking for. It tells them that you have focused on their needs from the very outset of the interview process.

, A value proposition letter:


Addresses a problem/problems that the company is facing.
Provides proof that you are capable of tackling this problem.
Uses short sentences and paragraphs to keep the reader’s interest.
Uses specific metrics and facts for instant credibility.
Is written in a conversational tone and is normally 150 words or less.

, In order to let your prospective employer know your distinctive value, you should first have a good grasp of the basics i.e. understanding your own value. You should do a small self-analysing session prior to actually starting to draft your value proposition letter.

, This pertains to the job title or titles you held while working with different employers. Expand further to describe the duties associated with each title.


If you had been a project manager, your duties might have included initiating, planning, implementing and monitoring the project, supervising the project management team, coordinating with stakeholders etc.

, After listing your previous job titles with duties, start recording your accomplishments i.e. the achievements that set you apart from others at workplace. This is all about answering the following questions (in reference to the account executive job title):


Were your customers satisfied with the value your products and services rendered?
Did you consistently win more business from the same clients?
Did your clients communicate their satisfaction to other companies? Did they recommend you to others for more business?
Upon achieving, were you entrusted to oversee more important clients?

, This means writing down all those projects that you either lead or you worked on in the capacity of a team member. Ask yourself questions like:


What key projects were you entrusted with that contributed to company’s growth?
Did you complete the projects on time and within budget?
Did you efficiently manage the projects?
Did you perform in a leading capacity and supervise other project team members?

, This point talks about the valuable soft skills you demonstrated in relation to working with others at the organization. Here you can think about:


Were you in a capacity to work effectively with people from all areas of expertise?
Did they like working with you?
What might have happened to the project if you were not a part of the team?
Did you share ideas and solve problems by working with others?
Was there a significant degree of cooperation?

, This involves thinking about what you learnt and what led you to discover more about yourself and your abilities. There could be moments which enabled you to realize something new about yourself. For example:


You might have hesitated to work on creating reports in Excel, however, with a self-learning approach you devoted 30 minutes every day and realized that you could actually create appealing graphical reports to present to management.

, Recognition is primarily meant to reinforce your accomplishments. This could range from a simple reference email praising work you did or a certificate to acknowledge the value you added. You can ask yourself questions like:


Were employers pleased with your work and were willing to give you more challenging assignments as a result?
What formal recognition have you received in regard to a job well done?

, You need to start by trying to actively take on board the positive feedback you receive from all sources. This is key, because many of us tend to easily forget when we are praised or appreciated.


Compliments land on us, slide off and we hardly remember them a few seconds later. However, listening to compliments is the fastest way to get an understanding of how others perceive your work. It’s not just restricted to hearing, but you should write down each and every compliment you get, as they will help you to draft your value proposition letter later on. You should:
Practice actively listening to the positive feedback you get and write it down. Go through your old performance reviews, letters of recommendation and thank you notes. Identify and write down the praiseworthy points

, The idea here is to record genuine comments and be careful that you do not alter them to reflect your own beliefs. Remember that other people are more objective about you and their feedback is often more accurate than your own assessment.

, Previously you have been passively accepting positive feedback about you, however, you should go one step further and take a more direct and active approach.


Ask people across the organization to send you their feedback on your personality and performance via e-mail. In case your organization undertakes a 360 degree feedback, you can review that and compile all the messages you receive from all sources into a single document.
Identify 10-15 people whom you regard highly and whose opinion you respect. They will be those who will offer you a candid feedback when asked “What is the single greatest value that I provide?”
Record all responses and compile them, then sort through the feedback and identify common themes. Categorize all feedback and give each category a title. Don’t change the exact writing or descriptive phrases.

, Once you have gotten the feedback you need, you can now draft a headline which will be your value proposition statement. Include at the top left hand of the page:


, The main body of your letter might go something like this:


Looking to achieve a significant boost in your organization's productivity? As a Production Team Lead, I possess skills that can serve to increase the output of your front line employees at a remarkable level, thereby enabling you to save time and resources and invest them on other business initiatives. Below are some of my specific skills and achievements, as described by my previous employers:
Daily parts quota exceeded by 6% on average.
Maintained a consistent output with a team of 7 people reporting directly to me .
Over a period of 1 year, workplace injuries were reduced by 3%.
With my experience and skills, I am proactively looking for new opportunities. Please let me know how I can help. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely,
Name, Product Team Lead, Company XYZ

, It's very important to proofread your letter to look for any glaring typos or obvious formatting errors. These things can make your value proposition letter look unprofessional and can seriously harm your chances of being contacted for a job.


Once you have proofread your letter, ask someone else to look over it for you. Someone looking at the letter with fresh eyes might pick up on any errors you missed.
Once you are confident that the letter looks good and reads well, send it to your prospective employer.

, During the interview or meeting, exchange business cards with your interviewer, or simply ask for his or her card if you do not have one. Getting your interviewer’s card will ensure that you send your thank you letter to the correct location.


If you did not get the business card during the interview, look up your interviewer or the person who gave you guidance on the company’s website, or contact the company and ask where you should direct the thank you letter.

, If you did not find the job engaging, or you don’t think that you got the job based on the interview, it is still important to write a thank you letter. There may be a position open with that company in the future, and a thank you letter may help to create a positive impression that could get you hired in the future.

, If you have participated in several interviews or meetings, make sure to personalize the letters. Mentioning specific instances that occurred during each interview or meeting will help to show that you were really engaged in the interview.


While you can have a basic format that you use for all of your thank you letters, make sure that you had a personal touch to each one, and double check that you address the letter to the correct person.

Address your envelope to the human resources department or hiring manager.,
Mail the letter and follow-up.",How to Write a Request Letter1," Search job postings to see if anyone is hiring your skill set, but sometimes it can be difficult finding jobs that are out and actively recruiting. There are times when it is best to inquire directly with a desired company as to whether they have any room for your unique set of skills. Figure out which one you are writing the letter for.


Do research on the company so you can know exactly what it is they do, stand for, and could be looking for in a new employee. This will also help you to tailor your letter to highlight skills that they value.
Look up employee reviews of the business. You can get a good sense of the work culture and see if it is a good fit for you. If you are laid-back, it might not be a good idea if you see that the company has a strict way of dealing with deadlines. Be wary if you only see good reviews without any of constructive criticism. That could be false advertising initiated by the company themselves.;
, The proper way to format the heading is in the top, left corner. Include your name and contact information such as address, email, and phone number. Beneath that, have the name and contact information for who you are writing to.


Use a clear, legible font. In the professional world is it best to stick with a clear, concise one such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri., It is best to have Dear Mr., Ms., or Mrs. followed by the name of the hiring manager. Do your research to find the name of whoever is in charge of hiring or who your letter will hit first. If you cannot find the name, address the letter to Whom It May Concern.

, This is the company’s introduction to you, so make sure to put your best foot forward. Say what position you are applying for and where you saw the job. Also, mention if you were referred by another employee or professional contact. Highlight the skills that are relevant to the position.


Keep your writing clear and concise. Companies do not want to have to read long, verbose letters. They want to see at a glance whether or not you will be a good fit for their company.

, This is where you can expand on your skills, where you acquired them and, and how these will be an asset to the company. If you are working off of a job description, make sure to address the specific qualifications they have outlined. If you do not have a description, work off of the research you have about the company and what you think would suit their needs.


Include how you would fit in at the company. If you know the job culture, it would be good to say some things about yourself that shows that you would easily assimilate with the company.
Focus on what you can do for them. Do not say what the company will personally bring you. That will sound like you are just using the company as a stepping stone. Even if this is the case, you should not let this be known. Everything you say should emphasise what you can do for them.

, This is where you thank them for their time in reviewing your letter. You should state that you are available for an interview at their convenience. If you plan on following up with a phone call, let them know in this paragraph.


Give a proper closing salutation. Best regards or Cordially work well for a professional letter., You want to make sure that this letter gets into the right hands and is not lost in all the other mail the company receives.

, If the company turns you down for an interview, ask them why. That could be constructive reasons to consider for the next time you apply to a similar job.

Mail your letter.",How to Write a Request Letter2," If you have been at the company for a while, it is normal to want a raise or an increase in responsibility. If it is not an automatic benefit that is outlined in your job, you might have to formally ask.


Ask after you have earned the right to a raise. Do not ask within your first 90 days or before you have really shown your asset and growth within the company. It is unprofessional to inquire about a pay raise or promotion you do not deserve.

, Every company has a different policy. If it is a formal letter, then continue with the next steps.


If it is to ask face-to-face, reference How to Ask for a Pay Raise.

, Sometimes it is your direct manager, but it could be the human resources department or even the CEO of the company if it is a smaller establishment. Discuss what it is you want with your manager and figure out the proper channels to go about inquiring about it.


There are times when you might have to send the letter to multiple people like your direct manager or supervisor as well as the human resources department. Be aware of this so that you fulfill all requirements for your request.
If you talk to your manager and they do not think you are ready for the raise or promotion, listen to them. Ask for constructive criticism and work on their suggestions. Inquire again in a few months when you believe you are more prepared.

, This should include your name and company contact information on the left hand side of the letter, and the name and contact information of whoever you are addressing beneath it by one line break.

, This will show how you have been beneficial for the efficiency for the company. This is also the place to allude to what you are asking for. This is to show that you have done your job and been an asset, and the raise is well-deserved.


Maintain your professionalism throughout the letter. It would be easy to become too familiar since you work with this company everyday. Remember that you are addressing your superior.
If you believe your length of time working at this company warrants a raise or promotion, say that as well. An example is if you worked five years and have never gotten a pay increase or promotion. It is best to tell them all the reasons you believe you deserve what you are asking for.

, If you implemented a new program or made a suggestion that positively benefitted the business, this is where to highlight that. Be sure to talk about the results of your innovative work. If it made a department run smoother or resulted in an increase of revenue, say that. Be specific.

, If you successfully complete your job requirements in a timely and efficient manner, highlight this point. You were hired in to do a job, and you do just that. This further proves your value to the company. It shows you are an integral part of their success.


Highlight any times you have gone beyond your job duties. For instance, maybe you work overtime to make sure projects are completed in a timely manner or you offer your free time to other departments that could use your assistance. If you are going beyond your job description, tell them that.
Show pride in your company and that you work there. If you believe in what the company does and that positively influences your attitude toward the job, make that known so that they believe you are a true team player that is there for the long-haul. If you are not as driven in this area, do your best to show any positivity you have for the company.
Talk about personal characteristics you have that benefit the company. If your professionalism and go-getter attitude works towards things getting done, say that. This is the time to really show how you have shined during your time there.

, You have outlined why you deserve it, now it is time to tell them exactly what you want. If it is a particular amount of money you are looking to make, let them know this. Also, let them know what you will do if you do not get this raise or promotion, such as if you have another job offer that you are considering.


Be open to negotiation. The company might not believe you deserve all of what you are asking for or not be able to afford it; however, they could be willing to give out a smaller amount. Tell them the highest amount you want, but be open to what they are willing to give.

, Thank them for their time and let them know within what timeframe you will be following up. Do not let it go for more than a week. This gives them time to think over your request, but also make sure that it is considered and reviewed. Include a professional closing salutation and your personal signature.

, Decide whether to use traditional mail or your company’s mail system. It also might be acceptable to hand the letter to your manager personally. Ask around to see what is the best protocol and follow-through.

Know what you are requesting.,
Use a professional letter heading.,
Greet whoever you are writing to.,
Ask for what you need.,
Tell why you need and what it will be used for.,
Thank them for reviewing the request.,
Mail the letter and wait for your response.",How to Write a Request Letter3," When you need some information such as past records or assistance with something like assistance with an event you are planning, it is best to write a formal letter that outlines exactly what it is that you need.

, As always, you want to format your letter correctly. The heading is an important part of this. At the top of the page in the left margin, put your name and contact information such as your phone number and address. Below it should be the address for whoever you are asking for information or assistance from.


If you are writing for something personal, use your home address. If it is for a job or company you are volunteering for, use the address for the business.

, If you know you are writing to, then that is great. Use the proper title such as Ms., Mrs., or Mr. Dear Mrs. and then their name. If you do not know, do some research to see if you can find who it should be directly written to.


Call the company or location to inquire about who would be best to ask. If you call the main line and tell them what you need, they could be able to direct you in the right way.
If you cannot find a name, then opt for To Whom it May Concern as your default.

, The first paragraph should explicitly tell what it is that you are requesting Give as many details as necessary so that the person or company you are asking for knows exactly what you need so they can properly decide whether or not they can fulfill your request.


Try not to omit any details. You do not want to spring something on them at the last moment and they decide to not go through with your request. You also do not want to make it more difficult at the last minute. This could lead them to deny you for any requests in the future.
Keep it simple. Do not ask for more than you need. You are requesting a favor, and it would be considered rude to ask for the world when you do not actually need it. Keep your request as simple as you possibly can.

, The second paragraph should focus on what the information or assistance is going to be used for. For instance, if you are asking for a paystub for proof of income in the first paragraph, use this one to state that it is to prove consistent work history for a rental application. This is important so that whoever you are asking knows what their information or request is going to be used for and this could impact their decision.

, Being polite and gracious could positively affect their decision if they know you appreciate their help. This could keep your reputation favorable for possible future requests.


If you are planning on following up, let them know. Let them know the best time to contact you so that they can know when they are able to reach you, as well.
Do not make it seem as if they have to do what you are asking. This is a request and not a command.

, Now, is when you wait. If you stated you will be following up, do so. If it has been over a week of time, give them a call or direct email to remind them of your request or have them go find your letter in a pile of mail they have not yet reviewed.


Be considerate of their decision either way. You do not want to burn any bridges in case you need to ask for another request in the future.
Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope to make it easier for any documents to be sent to you if need be.

Proofread your letter.",How to Write a Retirement Letter," Set up a meeting with a representative of the Human Resources (HR) department to discuss the details of your retirement plan. Doing this before you write your letter will help you to get an idea about how to shape your letter.


When you meet with HR, bring any questions you have with you and take notes during the meeting. Jot down important details, as well as details you feel might pertain to your letter. The person you meet with may give you some pointers about your letter that apply specifically for your company.;
, Keep in mind that you aren’t resigned, you’re retiring. You’ve served your organization with dedication and have gracefully made it to the point of retirement. Therefore your letter should portray this moment in a positive light. You don’t have to praise each co worker individually, but do your best to avoid mentioning any grievances when you brainstorm what to put in your letter.


Make a list of things that you love about the company, as well as accomplishments you achieved during your time working for this employer and other highlights of your career.

, You may be feeling a little sad about leaving your company, or maybe even reminiscent. However, it is important to remember that you should keep your emotions out of this letter; save it for personal letters or emails that you give to your coworkers.


Keep your tone formal because this letter will be a part of your retirement document. As such, avoid referring to your feelings, making jokes, or using sarcasm.

, Your retirement means the company will be losing an employee and will need a replacement to fill your position. In your letter you should provide some instructions about any ongoing tasks or projects that you started, and what needs to be done to completely them if you will not be doing so.


Prepare a plan for each individual project and refer to each in your letter. Each plan should contain details discussing how the replacement can easily pick up where you left off, making your transition out of the company that much smoother.

, You will be giving your formal retirement letter to your boss. As such, you will need to address the letter formally, even if you are on a first name basis with the person you work for. Use Mr., Mrs., or Ms. when addressing your letter.


You can choose to use your boss’s full name, or to only use his or her last name. If you were to use your boss’s full name, you would write: “Dear Mr. Cody Shier”. If you were to use only the last name, you would write: “Dear Mr. Shier”. You would not write “Dear Mr. Cody”.

, As mentioned in the previous step, you will be addressing your letter to your boss. Because of this, you would not address the letter using phrases like “To whomsoever it may concern”. A retirement letter is not an open letter; as such, it must be addressed to a specific person.


Double check that you have spelled the recipient’s name correctly.

, Your retirement letter can be divided into three paragraphs to give your letter structure and clarity. In each of these three paragraphs, you will discuss a different topic or topics.


Each paragraph will be described in detail in the following steps.

, Your first paragraph should be used to discuss your intention to retire, including such details as the name of your organization, your designation, and your planned last day at your company. Always double check these details, as this information will be used by other departments for documentation purposes.


An example first paragraph would contain information like: “I would like to take this opportunity to inform Cool Company of my intended retirement. I will be retiring from the position of Expert Candy Taster on September 18, 2014.”

, Your second paragraph should contain information pertaining to your time spent at the organization. This is when you highlight the enriching opportunities you have had, the people who made an impression on you or inspired you, and the overall general (positive) feeling you have for the company.


Example: “I have been with Cool Company for nearly 11 years, during which time I have had many enriching and rewarding experiences. I would like to thank all of the people (here you would like out people like those in management, colleagues, and subordinates) for their support and assistance. I feel truly honored to have been able to serve by their sides while we worked to provide candy to the world.”

, Your third and final paragraph should express your desire to make this transition as smooth for the company, and the person who will be taking your place, as possible. Mention your intention to provide assistance for your replacement. You can also mention how you are planning to spend your days in retirement, and that you would be happy to assist the company in any way that you can.


Example: “I know that my leaving disrupts several projects, but I have already prepared plans for my replacement that outline in detail each step that is needed to complete the tasks. I will also be available to assist said replacement in any way that I can. During my retirement, I will be sailing my boat around the world, but will be able to be reached by several means outlined at the end of this letter in case there is anything I can do to assist this wonderful company.”

, Your letter should end on a good note that involves extending your best wishes to the organization, your colleagues, and your replacement. You could also include a final word of thanks and acknowledgement.


Example: “Thank you very much for the wonderful memories. I look forward to following the successes of this grand company, and send my best wishes to my dear colleagues, as well as Ms. Matilda Mathers, who will be taking over my position. It has been an honor working here at Cool Company.

, After you have completed your paragraphs, sign off with an endnote such as “Yours truly” or “Sincerely,”. Writing “Sincerely” is generally thought to be the most formal way to sign off.


Below your endnote, you would sign the letter. Below your signature, place your printed name and your position at the company.

, Be sure to provide an email address, a phone number and your current address. The company can refer to these details when preparing your retirement document.


Double check details so that there are no mistakes. A wrong phone number or email address could lead to a great deal of confusion.

, Once you have written your letter, go over it again to make sure that there are no awkward sentences or grammatical errors. Consider having a friend who does not work at the company take a look at it to help you spot any errors you might have missed.

Type your letter using a word-processing application.,
Find a business letter template.,
Enter names and addresses.,
Use letterhead if you have it.,
Create a basic outline.,
Introduce both yourself and the candidate.,
List at least three exceptional skills or traits the candidate has.,
Provide supporting examples.,
Write your concluding paragraph.,
Invite follow-up questions.,
Proofread your letter carefully.,
Sign your letter.,
Submit your letter.",How to Write a Reference Letter," Although it may seem more personal to write your letter by hand, typing it is more professional. A type-written letter also will be easier for the recipient to read.Use a word processing application rather than the basic text application on your computer. Basic text apps lack the formatting options you'll need for your letter.
If the candidate tells you the letter should be submitted through email, you still should type out a separate letter and attach it to your email as a PDF after hand-signing it, rather than simply typing your letter in the body of the email.

, The word-processing application you use typically will have templates available that will allow you to easily format your letter. A traditional business letter template comes with pre-set margins and settings so you don't have to do this manually.Most word processing applications have several letter templates. Choose the formal business letter template, not one for a casual or personal letter.
Use a standard, readable font such as Times New Roman or Helvetica.
Typically the body of the letter will be set up so there is a double-space between paragraphs with no indentation. If you choose to indent your paragraphs, there's no need to double space between them.

, On the top of the first page of the letter, you'll type your name and address in the top right-hand corner of the page. The name and address of the recipient follows on the left side of the page.You also should include any additional contact information, such as your direct phone number or email address.
If you have letterhead that includes your contact information, there typically is no need to include your name and address a second time. However, you should include it if your letterhead refers to your employer as a whole and not you personally.
Following the addresses, there will be a line for the date. Depending on the template you use, there also may be a subject line. For the subject, you can simply state ""Reference Letter for"" with the name of the candidate.
In most cases you want to address the letter to a specific person. If the letter will be reviewed by several people, address it simply to ""hiring committee"" or ""admissions committee."" Speak to the candidate to find out what address is appropriate.

, If your employer has letterhead, or if you have personal letterhead, it will make the letter look more professional. Regardless, make sure you have high-quality paper to print the letter.The presentation of the letter reflects on you as well as the candidate. For this reason, you want it to look as formal and professional as possible.
Plain white paper is fine. Stay away from cheap copy paper. You can find good letter-writing stock at any office supply store and at most large discount stores.

, Generally, it's a good idea to organize your thoughts about the candidate before you sit down to write your letter. Brainstorm qualities you want to include, and select the strongest of them for your letter.Keep in mind that your letter typically should be no more than one page long. Academic reference letters may extend to two pages.
This gives you room for about three short paragraphs in the body of your letter. Because space is at a premium, you need to be able to write efficiently so that every word counts.
You may want to talk to the candidate while you're working on the outline of your letter. Find out more about the job or academic program to which they're applying, and what traits or skills are valued by the person who will evaluate the letter.

, Your letter will open with a line that begins ""Dear"" followed by the name of the person who will receive the letter. Then your opening sentences will provide your name, the name of the candidate, and the reason for your letter.Explain your relationship to the candidate and how long you've known them. If you have any special qualifications that make your reference more valuable, you should include those as well.
Confirm details that are relevant to the candidate's application. If you've been their supervisor at work, you'll want to state the company where you've worked and your position, as well as their position (if relevant), how long they've worked at the company, and how long you've supervised them.
For example, you might write ""My name is Bob Brass, and I am a managing supervisor at Button Factory. I am writing as a reference for Joe Johnson, who has been under my supervision at Button Factory for the past five years.""

, Immediately after your introduction, include a sentence that lists the skills or traits you will discuss in greater detail in the body of the letter.The type of skills or traits you include here depends both on your relationship to the candidate and the purpose for your letter. Character reference letters should focus exclusively on character traits, while employment reference letters should focus on particular skills the candidate has that make them a good fit for that particular job.
Academic reference letters are to some degree a hybrid of these two types of letters. In addition to skills that make the candidate well-suited to that particular course of study, you also might include character traits, such as their intelligence or their inquisitive nature.
This should be the last sentence of your first paragraph. Simply list the skills or traits – you'll discuss them in the next paragraph. For example, you might write ""In my experience, Joe Johnson has the stamina, organization, and communication skills to be a tremendous asset to your firm.""

, In the second paragraph of your reference letter, you will go into greater detail about each of the skills or traits you listed at the end of your introductory paragraph.Keep in mind that space is at a premium, and you don't want your letter to be too long. For this reason, it's best to find a concrete example that shows at least two, if not all three, of the traits or skills you mentioned in the introduction.
A concrete observation of the candidate that displays the skills or traits you mentioned is the most efficient way to get your point across.
For example, you might write ""Joe Johnson showed me he was capable of multi-tasking and performing several different button-pushing or button-turning operations simultaneously. For example, one day he volunteered to take on additional work when he anticipated there would be a slow-down in production because several other employees were sick. He frequently accepted additional responsibility and worked overtime while also maintaining an active role in his community and family.""

, In your third and final paragraph, end on a positive note by summarizing and restating the skills or traits you highlighted in the body of the letter, and indicate that you believe the candidate is well-suited for the job or academic course of study to which they've applied.This paragraph doesn't need to be more than two or three sentences long. Write one sentence summarizing the body of the letter and recommending the candidate. You also may want to include a sentence relating the example in your second paragraph to your future work.
For example, you might write ""To this day, I evaluate the work of my other employees in comparison to Joe Johnson. With his stamina, organization, and communication skills, Joe would be a tremendous asset to your firm.""

, The final sentence of your letter should include the easiest way to contact you if the recipient has any questions or would like to further discuss the information in your letter.Provide a specific way to contact you directly, including any limitations on the days and times you are available.
For example, you might write ""If you have any questions or would like to discuss my experiences with Joe further, please don't hesitate to call me at 555-555-5555. I am generally available at that number Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. through 6:00 p.m."" 

, A letter with sloppy grammar and punctuation reflects badly on the candidate as well as on you. Depending on the type of job or course of study to which the candidate has applied, a poorly proofread letter could backfire.Your word-processing application probably has spelling and grammar checking functions, but you shouldn't rely solely on these.
Print a draft of your letter and read over it carefully. Going through it backwards can help mistakes come to light that you might've missed simply reading the letter.
You also can read your letter out loud. This can help you find grammatical errors, as well as awkward phrasing or sentence structures that are confusing or difficult to read. If you find yourself stumbling over something as you read aloud, consider revising it so it's easier to read.

, Your letter should close with a formal closing line such as ""Sincerely,"" followed by space for your signature. You then should type your full name as you plan to sign it. You also may want to include contact information below your typed name, but this isn't necessary.After you've proofread your letter and are certain it's error-free, print a copy on your letterhead or quality paper stock.
Sign your letter using blue or black ink.
Make a copy of the signed letter for your own records, as well as another for the candidate's personal records. If you're writing the letter in your official capacity as a supervisor of the candidate, you may also need a copy for the business's records.

, Find out from the candidate how the letter is supposed to be sent to the recipient, and follow those instructions. If you're sending the letter using email, you may want to send an additional paper copy through the mail as well.Particularly if you're writing an academic reference letter, or a reference letter for a professional license, there may be additional requirements for the submission of the letter.
In some cases you can simply give the letter to the candidate and they will pass it on to the recipient, but in others you must send it directly to the recipient and it cannot pass through the candidate's hands.
Regardless, it typically looks better if you send your letter to the recipient directly, rather than through the candidate. This way the recipient knows the candidate has not altered the contents of the letter.
Pay attention to the due date. You don't want your letter to arrive late or be disqualified. This could reflect badly on the candidate or cause them not to get the position for which they've applied.

The first step, before you begin to write the letter, is to verify that the client does indeed have the requested funds. You will need to check your bank’s records to ascertain this information., Depending on the client’s needs, you may need to verify more than one account. You should check with the client to determine which accounts may be considered. For example, the client may have savings, checking, money market or other accounts with your institution, but may only want to consider the funds in one particular account. You should fully understand which account or accounts the client wants you to verify., A proof of funds letter generally should be something more than just a statement of the current account balance. You should check with the client to determine the level of funding that is to be represented in the proof of funds letter. Then limit the language of the letter only to that amount. For the client’s privacy, you should not provide more information than is requested.For example, the client may have $2,136,942.27 in a particular account. But at this time, the client only needs to verify proof of funds up to $100,000. Your letter should simply say that the client has “at least $100,000” available. That will serve the purpose but not disclose more of the client’s information than necessary.

, A proof of funds letter needs to appear official. You should use the official stationery of your institution. This should be on letterhead, providing the name of the institution and its address. If the institution has several branch locations, you should make clear which location is providing the letter., This seems like a mere obvious formality, but it is extremely important. You should not only provide a date as part of the heading of the letter but also provide a statement in the body of the letter as to the timing of the proof of funds verification.For example, your letter should say, “As of October 15, 2016, our client John Smith has access to at least $____ in his account at ABC Bank.”
Providing the date allows the seller to consider the validity of the proof of funds letter. For example, if you write the letter on October 15, 2016, but the client does not present it until the following April, the seller may have concerns as to whether the funds are still available. In that instance, the seller may require a new proof of funds letter.

, You must be explicit in the proof of funds letter as to the name of the account holder. If there is any discrepancy between the name of the individual requesting the letter and the name or names on the account, you should speak to the client about this. You should provide a clear statement in the proof of funds letter regarding the name or names on the account and the client who is requesting the letter.For example, if Mr. John Smith requests a proof of funds letter, and the account is a joint account between Mr. and Mrs. Smith, your letter may say, “As of October 15, 2016, Mr. John Smith has access to at least $____ in an account at ABC Bank. Said account is held jointly in the names of Mr. John Smith and Mrs. Alice Smith.” The seller can then review your letter and make its own determination about whether to proceed with the transaction.

, In some cases, a proof of funds letter may be written for a single specific purpose. If this is the case, you should specify any such limitations within the text of your letter. For example, if your client requests a proof of funds letter to attend an auction, your letter might say, “This proof of funds letter applies only to the client’s registration to bid at VanDerKellen Auction House on November 15, 2016. For any other purposes, you should contact the bank for more information.”, For the proof of funds letter to be accepted, it must be signed by an authorized representative of the institution. If you are not authorized to provide such information but are just drafting the letter, then you will need to obtain the signature of someone with sufficient authorization., The signature should be accompanied by the official title of the person signing the letter. This may be something like “Assistant Vice President” or “Loan Administrator.” It should be evident that you have the authority to provide the information contained in the proof of funds letter., In most cases, a notarized letter will not be required, as long as the letter meets all the other formalities. However, in some cases, a notarized signature might be required by the seller. You should ask the client if this is a requirement for this particular transaction., In many cases, a proof of funds letter needs to be completed and delivered quickly, because the client may be working on a time-sensitive transaction. You should find out from the customer if the letter should be held at your office to be picked up, or delivered to a particular address. The client may ask you to deliver the letter by special messenger or overnight delivery, if time is of the essence. In any case, it is up to you to know what is required.

,How to Write a Professional Thank You Note1,
"
Use high quality paper.,
Adhere to a business letter format.,
Specify your reasons for thanking in the first sentence.,
Stress the importance the recipient's help has had.,
Mention an openness for future aid and communication towards the end of your letter.,
End with a reiteration of thank you.,
Add a P.S.,
Complete a first draft, then edit and re-do.,
Print onto good paper and sign your name.",How to Write a Professional Thank You Note2," Even for brief thank-you notes, the type and quality of paper can say a lot by itself. Professional letters should be printed on a strong grade of paper that won't accidentally tear. On the other hand keep in mind that a more simple note or memo isn't expected to be as formal, so you needn't worry about going out of your way to buy the very best if it's not available. In the case of a simple, short note, you should make sure the paper is small too. A few sentences scrawled on a big sheet of paper will look uninvolved. Post-it notes are usually small and perfect for quick thank-you notes.

, As opposed to a quick note, a professional letter tends to be leagues more formal and serious. This entails sticking to pre-defined guidelines for letter writing. Include your name, the date and the addressee at the top of the letter.
Type using a standard font (such as Times New Roman) and size (12).
Include your signature at the bottom. This will give even a typed letter a personal touch.

, Although you will have more opportunity in a longer letter to go into detail, like the short note, you will still want to economize on what you're saying. In the first sentence or two, clearly state that you are thankful and why you are thankful. Due to the effort involved in writing a letter, it should be understood that the help will have been significant as well. If you think the person involved meant the difference between your success and failure, it's a good idea to write a letter.


Compared to a simple note, you can go into more detail about what you're thankful for with a professional letter, and explain how their part has benefited you. For example, if he vouched for you at a meeting, you can expand upon your gratitude by noting all the career doors their support has opened for you.
For example: ""I am writing to thank you for the help you offered at the board meeting today. The advice would offered to me beforehand proved invaluable, and the professionalism, work ethic and integrity you exhibit on a daily basis is a true example for the rest of the company to follow.""""

, Although your letter should still be a few paragraphs at max, you should still make sure to repeat points of interest, most notably your gratitude and the importance. Giving the recipient a feeling of personal importance will make him that much more likely to help you again in the future.


For example, if the recipient helped you through openly vouching for a project idea of yours, you can explain specifically how that will help you in the long run: ""Thanks to you vouching for me, I'll have my chance to show what a capable and innovative worker I am. I am confident that this tentative project will be a great success, and I am certain they'll want to see a lot more of me once it's done!""

, In a letter, it's important to leave the door open for future correspondence. Stressing that you would like to continue and develop a professional relationship with them will add substance to your gratitude, and make the recipient feel like his help has been taken to heart.

, The first and last thing the recipient reads will be the most memorable parts of the message, so it's important to end the message with another thank you before your name. Keep the thank you formal, but don't be afraid to dress up the gratitude a bit. For example, writing ""A thousand sincere thanks!"" sounds more impassioned than a basic ""Thank you"". , at the end if you're on personal terms. If you and the recipient are friends or connected in some way beyond a purely professional capacity, adding a P.S. at the end with a less formal greeting is a great way to add warmth to an otherwise austere correspondence. If the person knows you well enough, you'll want to let your personality shine through. For example: ""P.S: If this interview goes through, I'll buy us a round at the pub this weekend!
Or, if you and the recipient are on equal footing in the career hierarchy: ""P.S: I'll make sure to do the same for you next time! Together we'll be heading straight to the top!""

, A good professional letter will take much longer to plan than to write. Writing a second version will take a fraction of the time as the original, and on your second time around you'll be able to make it as good as you want it to be. Decide what parts of your letter you like the most, and do without the weaker elements, replacing them instead with sentences and ideas you think will best convey what you're trying to say.


If you're having any confusion regarding whether your letter works or not, try reading it out loud. You'll find reciting the letter (or any written document, for that matter) will bring attention to issues and areas for improvement you wouldn't normally pick up from reading alone.

, Once you've finished the draft, you should print it off as soon as possible and give it your signature in pen. Even with a typed document, you still want to give it a personal touch. A good way to cap off a professional letter is to type your full name, then make your pen-made signature right below it.

"
"
Keep your writing brief.,
Specify why you're thanking and how the recipient's help has benefited you.,
Include your name and date somewhere in the note.",How to Write a Professional Thank You Note3," Unlike a full-bodied professional letter, a simple note is not likely to be more than a few sentences in length. This means you have to economize on what you have to say. Get right to the point with your message. You don't need to be near as formal here, so you can dispense with a lot of the traditional formatting, so long as you remember to state your name, and to whom you're writing.


Using a pen with legible handwriting is preferable in this case.

, In a short thank-you note, you'll have to economize on the amount of things you want to say. While making sure to say thank you is the most important thing, it's just as vital you specifically state why you're thanking the person, and how you'll put the recipient's help or advice to good use.


For example, if the recipient gave you advice on an upcoming job interview, you can say: ""I'd like to thank you for all the advice you imparted regarding the interview. I'm going to keep it in mind while I'm preparing for it; I'm confident it will help me land the job!""

, Even if a post-it thank-you note is relatively informal, you shouldn't go without giving the name and date. Particularly if the individual is very busy, it may not be clear who sent the message without a name. Adding a date also helps to give the note more context and professionalism.


If space on the page is an issue, you can just go the formal route and write the date in shorthand (e.g. 09/27/15).

Skip mailing services for resumes.",How to Write a Professional Mailing Address on an Envelope," No matter where the letter is going, it's best to address it to a person, if possible. Figure out who would be the most appropriate person for the letter to find. If you can't find a person's name, consider using a department, such as the HR department.Do your research to find out who you should send it to. For example, if you are sending in a resume, look around online to figure out the appropriate person. If you can't find a person, it's acceptable to call the company and ask who the letter should be addressed to.

, Honorifics are things like ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."" that go before a person's name. However, always pick a professional designation or title over MR, MS, MISS, or MRS. For example, if you're writing someone with a doctorate, you'd use ""DR"" before their name., On the next line, place the individual or professional title of the person, such as ""CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT."" On the next line, use the person's title within the company, such as ""HEAD ACCOUNTANT."" If you can only find one, use that one., If the letter needs to go to a specific department once it reaches the business, you need to include that department in your address. It should have its own line underneath the person's titles, such as ""ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT."", The name of the company or main recipient goes next, if applicable. Like the other elements, it receives its own line, below the division or department the letter is being mailed to. Make sure to get the name of the company completely correct, such as ""ARIEL'S ACCOUNTING FIRM."", Now, you're down to the street address, the place the business is actually located. The street number goes first, followed by a directional abbreviation (if applicable), such as ""NW"" or ""S."" Next, place the street name, as well as any suffixes to the street name, such as ""ST.""You may also need to at a suite number, such as STE 118.

, Next, write the city and state. You don't need a comma between the two, and make sure to use the state code abbreviation. After that, use the 5-digit zip code, as well as the 4-digit extension with a hyphen in between. If you don't know the 4-digit extension, you can look it up using the other information you have on the USPS website., The font should be large enough so that's easy for a post office employee to read it. The standard is the font should be readable when held at arm's length. If your font is too small to read at this distance, switch to a bigger one.USPS recommends at least an 8-point, legible font., The USPS prefers that you don't use punctuation when writing out the address. That is, don't use commas or periods, even to divide the state from the city. Also, don't use periods after abbreviations such as ""ST"" or ""NW.""However, you can use hyphens if the street number calls for it.You can also use a hyphen between the 5-digit zip code and the 4-digit extension.

, The USPS doesn't require that addresses use all uppercase letters. However, it is the preferred method for writing an address. Therefore, make sure to capitalize the whole address, not just the beginning of each word., The USPS has standard abbreviations for things like directional words, street suffixes, and states. Find the correct abbreviations for the words you're using on the USPS website, to make sure your letter gets to where you need it to go., Remember, you also need to include your return address. Both addresses should be on the same side. Your address should be in the upper left-hand corner, while the main address should be over towards the right, but more centered vertically., The best option is type the addresses. You can either use labels that you print on or print directly on the envelope. You can also just print on a plain piece of paper, cut the label out, and glue it on, though that can end up being messier.Your word processing software should have templates for printing on both labels and envelopes. Pick the template that matches the labels you bought, then type out the address for both the sending address and return address. Alternatively, pick the template that matches your envelope, then type in the addresses and print it.

, When mailing a letter such as a resume, think about using a 12 by 9 envelope. That way, you don't have to fold your letter to fit in the envelope. When the recipient gets it, it will look more professional. Keep in mind, though, that larger envelopes cost more to mail.Keeping it uncreased also allows the employer to make copies more easily.

, Paperclips and staples can make the resume look less professional. A better option is to use neither, and just make sure you have your last name and a page number on each page, so if one gets mixed up with other papers, it can be placed back in order., Some people use mailing services to send out large numbers of their resumes to potential employers. However, many of these companies use the same fonts and styles for all their resumes, and employers will reject them without even looking at them. Stick to doing it yourself."

Do some research to make sure that you are aware of all of the different 'sides' on this topic. Your experiences and how you survived or accomplished it!

, Kids? School principal? Parents/ Adults?

,, One of these charts is the ""Arguments For"" chart, and one is the ""Arguments Against"". In the ""Arguments For"" chart, fill in the four left boxes with reasons supporting your argument. On the right side, give evidence supporting your reasons. Do the same on the ""Arguments Against"", except use reasons against your argument.

, There are two layouts to choose from: a letter where each paragraph is a separate reason supporting and also against your argument; or, one paragraph with supporting reasons and another paragraph with reasons against.

, The topic sentence does not have to be great. You can simply state your argument. (i.e. Marine animals should not be captured for scientific studies.) This is a good way to start if you want to get straight to the point.

, Don't constantly go back and edit; just write the whole letter, print it out, and then mark it up!

, Realize that you may have to edit it many times before it is perfect. When it is as good as you can get it, look up the address of the person/people you're sending it to, then send it to them!

Understand the purpose of a pitch letter.,
Target the appropriate media.,
Pay attention to suggested format and style.,
Include the right information.",How to Write a Pitch Letter," Pitch letters are letters written to producers and editors, asking them to interview you or another individual for their show or news article. These letters are meant to pique their interest enough to ask for more information. Offering a fresh story or an unusual angle to a current trend will better the chances of your pitch being accepted.;
, Take the time to research the publications and media that are best suited for your subject. It is important to find the right fit before sending your pitch letter. Otherwise, you may be sending a good letter to the wrong publication or media outlet, which is a waste of time for all concerned.


Explore potential media outlets. Familiarize yourself with the type of issues they cover and who they typically interview. Determine which one is the best fit for you.
Show how this interview or article connects with their company and audience. If it is a local media outlet, tie it to your community. If it is a national publication, connect it with a recent nationwide trend or interest.
Find the appropriate individual to whom you should direct your pitch letter. Addressing your letter to a specific person increases the chances of having your letter read as well as having someone follow up with you.
Spell his or her name correctly. Also include the appropriate title. Making mistakes in these two areas hurts your credibility and decreases your chances of being asked for more information.

, Though format can vary a bit, the basic structure of a pitch letter remains the same.


Limit your pitch to 1 page with 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins. Keep your letter concise and to the point.
Watch your words. Be direct instead of elaborate. Do not say that they ""must"" interview you; instead, invite them to take advantage of an upcoming opportunity.
Use your company letterhead. If you do not have letterhead, be sure to send a well-designed letter that looks professional and clean.

, Not providing the appropriate information will quickly send your pitch letter to the trash pile.


Grab their attention at the beginning of your pitch. Producers and editors receive hundreds of pitch letters every week. Your letter needs to begin with a strong hook that will grab their attention and entice them to keep reading.
List the basic details. This includes the ""who, what, where, when, and why"" of your event or company. Do not make them hunt for this information.
Leave your contact information in the last paragraph. Include your website, if appropriate. Do this even if it is listed on your letterhead. Make it easy for the producer or editor to follow up with you.

"
"
Decide how important and formal the letter is, and deliver it accordingly.,
Post it somewhere visible.,
Seal your letter in an envelope.,
Attach a minor gift if appropriate.,
Wait until an appropriate, quiet time if you choose to deliver the letter personally.,
Be polite and gracious while delivering your letter.",How to Write a Professional Thank You Note4," It would be silly to seal a two sentence thank-you memo in an envelope and formally present it to the recipient. On the other hand, you might come off as rushed or even lazy if you deliver a formal letter carelessly.

, The best way to give a smaller thank-you note is to put it somewhere he will normally go. Personally handing someone a thank-you note will come off as redundant, so it's best for the recipient to see it when you're not around. For example, if it is a fellow co-worker, you could attach it to his cubicle as soon as you get to work. Another opportunity would be to be to stick it to the recipient's door.


Although it's not a likely risk in a professional note, it's a good idea to exercise some discretion with a note. Assume that anyone could potentially read it, especially if you're leaving it in a high-traffic area like the office space. If there is any doubt, it's best to seal your letter in an envelope.

, Unlike a simple note, which is more informal and spontaneous, giving a letter can involve some ritual and formal courtesy. Feel free to seal it in an envelope and place it in their inbox, or even hand it to them personally. If you give it personally, make sure to bolster the letter with a smile and a firm handshake.

, In some cases, it may be appropriate to attach something inexpensive (>$10) to the note as a way to better manifest the gratitude. Take care only to do this when it is appropriate however; you don't want to make it look like you're trying to bribe someone. If you attach a gift, it is best to deliver the letter and gift personally.

, It's not recommended you personally give a short note to someone personally, but a bigger letter (especially when coming with a gift) may be appropriate depending on the circumstances. If you decide it's best to give it to the recipient directly, you should keep surrounding circumstances in mind. If the recipient is bogged down with work, he might be annoyed by any new distractions. Waiting until a lunch break or a lull in the day's busyness is a good time to hand it over.

, You would give very mixed messages if you don't personally show the same gratitude you wrote in your letter. This is especially true if you have written the letter purely as a professional gesture. If and when you deliver the letter, you need to make sure your personal behaviour is in line with the meaning of the letter. Be confident, and remember to smile.


If you're feeling anxious, take a moment to remember the fact that very few people have felt anything other than gratitude and satisfaction for being thanked for something!

Decide if you know the person well enough to write the reference letter.,
Ask the candidate to provide your with their transcripts.,

Relate the candidate’s skills to the school and program that the person is applying for.,
Give plenty of examples that substantiate your claims about the candidate.,
Provide a well-rounded view of the candidate.,
Avoid stating what the transcripts have already said.,
Take your time when writing the reference letter.,
Proofread your letter once you are done writing it.",How to Write a Reference Letter for Graduate School," Before you begin brainstorming, consider whether or not you feel you know the person well enough to write a letter that could really help them to get into graduate school. Crafting a relatively generic letter because you do not know the person that well will not help the person to get into graduate school. Ask yourself:


How long have you known the person?
Can you list some of their best qualities off of the top of your head?
Can you think of things that will make them stand out from the crowd?
If you have not spent much time with the candidate, but have done so in the past, consider setting up a time for the candidate to meet up with you and tell you a bit about their life now, what they hope to do, and what they feel they have accomplished recently.;
, While it is important to come up with unique information about the candidate that you have witnessed firsthand, having the person’s transcripts in front of you can help to jog your memory and inspire you. Ask the candidate to provide you with:


Their up-to-date resume
Transcripts
A list of their achievements over time (as detailed as possible)
Their goals and ambitions and how these relate to the program they’ve applied for

, Do a bit of research to assess the school that the candidate is applying to. Try to determine the values that school might wish to see in a student, or what achievements might impress the school the most.


Look at the school’s website and learn a bit about the culture of the school, what they expect out of their students, and what kind of talent the school appreciates or encourages.
If you do not have time for this research, you can ask the candidate to bring you information about the school. This should be relatively easy for the candidate, as they have most likely done extensive research on the school.

, Aside from learning about the school as a whole, looking at the specific program can also help you to decide what information to include in your letter. Doing this research will also help you to determine what information is unnecessary to include.


For example, if the candidate is applying to a nanotechnology program, you should be able to write something about how the candidate has always been fascinated by technology, or to discuss papers or speeches that the candidate has given on the subject. You might include information on projects you have collaborated on together in this field.

, These achievements do not need to be limited to academics or work experience, though you can certainly include information on these topics. You should also include achievements in extra curricular activities, like sport, volunteering, or music, and a discussion of the candidate's skills and personality.


Make a list of all of the skills or achievements the candidate has, as well as examples that support each of these subjects. For example, if you say that you have been impressed by the candidates commitment to the stray dog community in the area, back this statement up with a discussion of the fundraiser the candidate single handedly ran.

, This means that your letter should be a sources of information that cannot be found on transcripts, in applications essays, or through test scores. A reference letter is an opportunity to help the review committee gain insight into the candidate’s personality and abilities in a way that cannot be done by looking at transcripts.

, Consider the program that the candidate is applying for when deciding what information to include in your letter. If you want to include information that does not specifically pertain to what the candidate will need to be successful in the program they are applying for, keep your discussion of these extraneous skills brief.


For example, if the person is applying for a biomedical engineering program, discussing the person’s ability to write beautiful poetry, or give an incredibly engaging speech may not be necessary. Keep discussion of these traits to a sentence or two at the most.

, Structure your letter so that the text appears to flow together. Start with a brief overview of your relationship with the candidate, as well as a discussion of the purpose of the letter. After this, discuss the candidates achievements. After discussing the candidates achievements, spend some time talking about your observations regarding the candidate’s skills, personality, and capabilities, followed by your recommendations.


Create a bare bones outline that covers all of these topics. List your examples or the information you will use in each of these sections.

, This letter will be read by the admissions committee; as such, it should be addressed to them as a whole, rather than being addressed to an individual.


For example, you could write “To the Santa Clara University Admissions Committee” or “To whom it may concern”.

, Spend a couple of sentences discussing yourself and your relationship with the candidate. You should also introduce the candidate, along with information about yourself. For example:


”As an English professor at ERL University, I have seen many students both succeed and fail. One of the most successful student’s I have seen in my thirty years at this institution is John Smith, who has reshaped our entire nonfiction writing program. John Smith attended this university from Fall 2009 to June 2013.”.

, The application committee will be hoping to learn how admitting the candidate will affect their school, and what sort of benefits and skills the candidate will be able to bring to the program. Your goal is to present the candidate’s personality and skills in a way that help the committee to see that the candidate will be a benefit to them.


At the same time, you should also take a moment to mention how the program will benefit the candidate. For example, you could say something like “This nonfiction writing graduate program will help John Smith expand his already inspiring abilities by allowing him to hone his magazine journalism skills”. However, try to be more specific regarding both the program and the candidate’s skills.

, For each skill or achievement that you mention, you must also relate that thing back to the program and how the two tie together.


How will that skill help the candidate succeed in this program?
How does that achievement lend itself to the abilities need to be successful in this program?

, Each time that you make a claim about the candidate’s abilities or personality, you must back these claims up with examples of how the candidate has demonstrated these qualities.


For example, if you say that the candidate is very dedicated to his craft, mention how on multiple occasions you came into the English department early in the morning, or late at night, to find John Smith still reading or writing, coffee cups strewn across his desk.
Or, if you say that the candidate goes above and beyond the basics, discuss the time when you asked your students to give a speech and the candidate came in with not only a speech, but also a visually stunning slide show that perfectly accompanied the speech.

, Recommendation letters shouldn’t be restricted to academic achievements; selectors don’t want to see grades alone. They want a well-rounded person who can benefit from the program and seamlessly adjust to the institution. Mention the applicant’s personality and interests.

, Try to discuss information that is not covered in the candidate’s transcripts or application essay. Instead, discuss things that you experienced first hand with this person, or qualities and achievements that are not listed on other documents that the candidate will be sending into the application committee.


For example, look over the candidate’s transcripts and then discuss qualities, personality traits, and achievements that you have seen the person demonstrate, but that are not necessarily written about anywhere else.

, If the candidate gives you a date that they will need the letter by, set aside plenty of time so that you do not have to rush through the writing process. This letter is a very important part of the candidate’s application process; as such, you should put some time and effort into it.

, Once you have finished writing, set the letter aside and do other things. The next day, read over the letter and correct any awkward sentences or grammatically incorrect parts of the letter.


Double check that all proper nouns, including the candidate’s name and the name of the institution are spelled correctly.
Have someone else look over the letter if you feel uncertain about a specific part of the letter.

Support your statements with research.,
Look for bias within your sources.,
Present all sides.,
Report only what you see and write only what you have learned from credible sources.,
Include both male and female pronouns when referring to people in general.,
Change gender-specific professional titles to gender-neutral.,
Refrain from using gender roles.,
Eliminate derogatory statements and racial slurs.,
Avoid stereotypes.,
Be politically correct.,
Treat everyone as unique and individual people.,
Stay away from making generalizing statements.,
Never include your own biases.,
Look for any bias you may have written.,
Make sure all your facts are either common knowledge or fact checked.,
Ensure that you did not add your opinion to something that was a fact.",How to Write Without Bias," Do not make statements based solely on your own personal experiences or opinions. The statements you make need to be backed up by concrete and proven facts from reliable sources.When writing, ask yourself if everything you are presenting as facts are things you believe, things you remember, or things you have researched.
When they are things you believe or things you remember, always fact check them with credible sources before including them in your writing.
Remember that references to credible sources add a lot of weight to the points you are laying out in your piece.;
, Use reliable and credible sources. Using scholarly journals and websites that have “.edu,” “.gov,” or “.org,” are good ways to ensure that you are accessing reputable sources that should be free of their own biases. You can also look to reputable news stations like CNN or magazines and newspapers.These types of sources are known for holding their writers to higher standards. This is what makes them more credible.
Cite these types of sources when possible so that readers will develop a sense of trust in what you have written.
Remember that over-relying on citations can make you seem as if you can’t expand ideas. This may make you seem like a less capable writer.

, Make sure your paper is balanced by presenting all sides of a topic. Provide your reader with research-based facts for each side of a topic and both sides of an argument. You can refute one side of a topic or argument within your paper, but only by proving that particular side is stronger based on evidence.This requires a great deal of research and fact checking.
Doing what it takes to get all the facts you can about both sides of an argument will greatly enhance the credibility of your article.
The more credible your articles are, the more credible and respected you will be regarded as a writer.

, Your objective is to give all of the relevant information so that your reader can draw their own conclusions. Taking this outsider and observational approach will help you avoid bias and write objectively.It is easy to add opinions without knowing. For example, writing, “The accident probably happened because he was distracted,” without knowing for sure if the driver was distracted, is adding information based on opinion not facts.
If you are writing on a topic related to an event, ask or consult a credible source for details of which you are unsure.
Don’t rely on your memory alone. Always check the facts.

, Instead of using “he” or “him” to represent a group, include “he or she” and “him or her.” Using only the male pronoun to refer to both men and women is bias.For example, it is bias to say something like, “Every person at the meeting said that he would be at the fundraiser.”
Instead, include both gender pronouns. “Every person at the meeting said that he or she would be at the fundraiser.”
Some people are beginning to use they or their instead of gender pronouns.For example, ""The shopkeeper paid their bills on time.""

, Gender neutrality is key to writing free of bias when you are talking about both sexes. When referring to a group of law enforcement officers, it is not fair to assume that they are all male. The same goes for any profession.Instead of saying fireman, use firefighter. Change chairman to chairperson, stewardess to flight attendant, mailman to courier, and actress to actor when referencing a profession in general and not writing about a specific professional.
Using gender neutral titles is not only politically correct, it is also a way to be inclusive.

, Not all women are stay-at-home housewives and not all men are the breadwinners of the family. Do not perpetuate ideas that are not factually backed.For example, “A single parent has to divide her time between her career and her children.” This statement is stereotyping that all single parents are women, when a single parent can be a man or a woman.
Instead rephrase this statement to say, “A single parent has to divide their time between their career and their children.” Or, you can replace “their” with “his or her.

, Never write about a specific group of people for the purpose of humor. Racial jokes are distasteful and serve no purpose in your writing. Report the facts about a group of people, not opinions.


Doing so may infuriate many people.
It may also make you popular with people or groups with whom you may not want to be affiliated or associated.
Avoiding these things keeps you credible.

, To make a statement about a particular group, there must be evidence and statistics to back up your objective statement. Some examples of non-factual statements include:""All white Americans are obese.""
""All African Americans are good at basketball.""
""Elderly citizens are helpless and need to be put in a home.""
""All Jews are good with money.""

, Refer to a specific group of people (racial, religious, sexual orientation) by what they prefer to be called. When in doubt, always research the politically correct title. Politically correct lexicon has changed over the years and continually changes. Avoid offending anyone by being respectful and well-informed.Become familiar with websites and other sources that provide current guidance on politically correct terms.
Politically correct titles change from time to time for different groups, so always check.
Once you start being aware of being politically correct, it may become second nature.

, A person’s sexual orientation, skin color, religious beliefs, disabilities, age, gender, or occupation do not define them wholly. Only report these details when they are essential to your topic or argument.For example, it is not necessary to include a person’s sexual orientation as a means of describing them. If you were writing a current events article about a firefighter who saved a kitten from a tree, it would be unnecessary to mention that the firefighter is a gay man, if that was the case.

, Do not make a statement within your writing that ropes everyone together by using the term “all.” Use specific numbers based on credible research to make informative claims. Present specific facts and numbers.


It is bias to state something like, “All criminals have troubled backgrounds;” this is making a general and opinionated statement. Your writing will be a great deal more credible with facts that are researched instead of generalizations.
Rephrase your statement to express free of bias facts, “According to a study of 1,435 newly sentenced prisoners performed by the Ministry of Justice, 49% reported having a troubled childhood.”

, Regardless of your personal feelings, it is imperative that you do not include those in your writing. Do not make assumptive statements about gender-roles, cultural backgrounds, religious beliefs, occupations, or socio-economic classes.Doing these things has the potential of angering some or all who read your piece. This can create hostile feelings towards you.
Instead, always ask yourself if what you have written applies to everyone in the group about which you have written or if it is just what you believe.
Statements like ""all Christians believe that,"" or ""Sarah did that because she is a lesbian"" should be warning signs that you are being biased about a group.
It is best to write about individuals and not include things like linking them to religion, racial groups, sexual orientation or socio-economic statuses. For example, write, “John won the award,” not, “John, a gay man, won the award.”

, Once you have completed your piece, read over it carefully. You would be surprised how often your opinions or beliefs sneak in, even when you know what to avoid writing.


You may find that you have included information you believed to be true, but did not check.
While proofreading, if you see something in your piece that makes you ask yourself about its veracity, it is in your best interest to check it.
It doesn’t hurt to have another person read your piece. They may be able to spot questionable content.

, Common knowledge would be things like who was elected president and the length of his term. Uncommon knowledge would be things like his stance on given issues.


If you only believe you know something, fact check it. Don’t just rely on memory for details about anything.

, When we fact check something that many people are talking about, we may insert information that many agree upon but is their opinion.


An example would be, “Donald Trump said that Muslims would be fully vetted before entering the country. This is because he doesn’t trust them.” When adding, “This is because he doesn’t trust them,” you added an opinion. It is easy to commit this kind of error. Make sure you have only written the facts.
Think if you have ever read in credible articles or books or heard reported on credible news stations those things you are adding .

Mail the letter.",How to Write a Payment Reminder," Your letter should be set up like a standard business letter.Set the font to something readable—usually Times New Roman 12 point works for most readers.


Remember to include the date that you are sending the letter.
If you don’t use company letterhead, then you need to include your business address at the top.;
, You should mail out an initial reminder the first day that payment is due.You want to use a friendly tone. After all, the customer may have simply forgotten that payment was due or a check might even be in the mail. Make sure to give the customer a deadline for paying.


You could write: “This letter is to remind you that payment on your account #45667 was due on April 12, 2016. As of today, we have not received payment from you. Kindly submit your payment within seven days.”
You might be willing to offer a payment plan. If so, then mention that in the letter. For example, you might accept half of the amount due this month and the other half a month later., You don’t want the customer to send you payment using a method you don’t accept. To protect yourself, explicitly state what payment methods you accept—personal check, money order, cash, or credit card (such as Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, etc.)If credit card payment is an option, include lines at the bottom of your letter for the card number, expiration date, cardholder name, signature, and the amount to be charged.
For example, you could write: “You may pay by check or money order, made payable to . As a courtesy to our clients, we also accept payment with Visa, Master Card, or American Express. If you choose to pay your balance with a credit card, complete the form at the bottom, sign, and return this letter to our office. Alternately, you could call to set up credit card payment.”, You should tell the customer what attachments you have included. Also make sure to tell them to disregard the letter if payment has already been sent. If your letterhead doesn’t contain a phone number or email address, then you should provide that information as well.For example, you could write, “I have enclosed a copy of the invoice I sent. Also enclosed is a stamped, addressed envelope you can use. If you have already sent your payment, then please ignore this letter.”Remember to sign your letter. Also include your title, e.g., Patient Account Coordinator.

, You can send the letter using email or by mail. If you send by mail, then it’s best to send certified mail, return receipt requested.This will show that the customer has received your reminder.


Don’t forget to include any enclosures, such as a copy of the invoice or an envelope.
If you send this notice by email, then send attachments as PDFs.

, Prepare a second letter using the same format as the first. Remember to mention that you have already sent a first notice but you haven’t heard anything. If you’ve added late fees, charges, or interest, make sure to mention that. Adopt a serious tone. Your first reminder was friendly, but now you need to start being serious.


For example, you could write, “As of today, we have not yet received payment from you although we sent you notice on April 13. As a result, your account is overdue. We have not yet applied any late payment or interest charges.”, Give the customer another seven days or so to send payment. Also remind them of the consequences if they don’t pay up. For example, you might add late fees or other charges.


Sample language could read: “If we don’t receive payment in full within the next seven days, we may add a late penalty of $50 to your account.”You can remind the customer of your acceptable payment methods, using the same language that you used in your first notice.

, You can tell the customer what will happen if they don’t pay up. For example, you might have a policy of no longer doing business with someone if they are late with their payments.


For example, you could write: “Please note that we have a policy of refusing service to any individual who has an account more than 14 days overdue. We trust it will not be necessary to stop doing business and look forward to your payment. If you have already sent payment, then please ignore this letter.”You shouldn’t email this notice. Instead, mail it certified mail, return receipt requested. Always keep a copy for your own records.

, Set up the letter as a standard business letter. However, also include a heading, such as the words “Final Demand.” Put the words in bold and underline them.You want the recipient to know that this is their last chance to pay up before you take additional action.

, You should tell the customer that they are now in breach of your agreement and that you have added interest or a penalty for being late. Then tell them the new total amount they need to pay.


Sample language could read: “Despite previous reminders, your account remains delinquent. Because you are now in breach of our payment terms, we are adding a $50 late payment penalty per our ‘Late Payment of Debts Terms of Agreement.’ The total outstanding debt is now $225.00.”, You should tell the customer how much time they have to make final payment. You should not give them too much time. For example, you could set a 72-hour deadline. Explain what will happen if the customer doesn’t meet the deadline. For example, you might pass the account onto collections or sue the customer in court.


Sample language could read: “It is now crucial that you pay your outstanding bill in full within the next seventy-two hours. If you don’t, then we will have little choice but to pass this account to our debt collection agency, who will add more charges to the account.”You can bold the “seventy-two hours” to make those words stand out.

, Emphasize that the client should take this final demand letter seriously and pay up. For example, you could write, “We therefore suggest that you take this matter seriously and pay your balance in full as soon as possible.”, You should send this one through the post, using certified mail, return receipt requested.If you don’t hear back from the customer, then go ahead and send the account to collections or sue—whichever you threatened in the letter.

Balance both professional tone and personal information.,
Remain honest.",How to Write a Motivation Letter," During the entire brainstorming portion of the process, take detailed notes that you can refer back to while writing the letter. Include both primary information and secondary details, regardless of whether or not you think you'll actually use them for the letter itself.;
, Read through any print or digital literature provided to you by the university, including its website. Pay close attention the the school's admission requirements for the program you're pursuing.The university will usually describe the qualifications they hope to see from perspective students, and you can use that information to tailor your motivation letter toward that specific school.
For instance, if the university is heavily involved in humanitarian efforts related to the program topic, you could give more attention to your own humanitarian interests. On the other hand, if the school literature strictly focuses on academics, you'll know to keep the letter equally focused on academic aspirations and experiences.

, The program admissions board will want to know why you should be chosen over someone else, but before you can give the board that information, you'll need to have the question settled for yourself.


Review your academic career through now. Figure out what courses, instructors, and influences led you to the path you're presently pursuing and determine how it happened.
Think about why you chose this school and this program. Consider all of your motivations, including the personal and professional ones.

, Gather your notes together and try organizing them into an outline. Your outline should include separate sections for the introductory statement, each separate body paragraph, and your closing remarks.


If you're not comfortable making an outline, consider arranging your notes into a flow chart or similar organizational tool. The important part of this step is to provide structure to your previously unstructured ideas.

, As soon as you've organized you thoughts, you should begin writing the first draft of your letter. Understand that this should only be a first draft; you'll need to make revisions before it's ready to send.


Include everything you can think of that seems important, and describe it with as much sensory detail as possible. You might end up with way too much information and way too many pages, but you can trim away the unnecessary points during the editing portion of the process.Refer to both your informal notes and formal outline for this part of the process. Also note that you should follow the guidelines provided in the “Structuring Your Letter” section of this article.

, After completing your first draft, step away from the letter for at least one or two days before you think of editing it.At a very basic level, you need to proofread the grammar and structure of the letter.
Even more importantly, you also need to proofread the letter for accuracy and consistency. Your facts should be correct, your ideas should be original, and your tone should be evenly professional.

, While not strictly necessary, it may help to get external opinions from qualified sources. The best people to ask include professors and students currently enrolled in graduate school.


Ideally, you should try getting in touch with someone already enrolled in the specific program you're applying to. That individual will have a clearer understanding of what the university wants from its students.

, Analyze the motivation letter using your own critiques and the critiques of others. Don't be afraid to rewrite the letter several times until you get it right.


Remove redundant language or ideas, as well as information that isn't directly focused on the main idea of the letter. On average, the letter should only be about one full page in length; anything longer is usually considered unnecessary and discouraged.
Note that some programs may look for letters ranging between two to three pages long. It's best to read through the application for specific information regarding length; if you are unable to find such information, sticking with one page should be safe.
Make sure that the most important arguments are positioned earlier in the letter than less significant points, and rearrange the contents of the letter as needed to make it flow well.

, If you know the name of the individual who reviews admissions applications, it's best to address the letter to that individual by name.If you are unable to track down a specific name, you should at least try to address the reader by position. Options might include:

“Dear Admissions Counselor,”
“Dear Admissions Board,”
“Dear Admissions Director,”


Only use generic forms of address (e.g., “To Whom It May Concern,” “Dear Sir or Madam”) as a last resort.

, The first paragraph of your motivation letter should concisely summarize the rest of the letter, giving the reader an accurate idea of what to expect.


This first paragraph should only consist of one to three sentences, and you should indirectly state that you are presenting a motivation letter for your chosen program.
For example, your opening line could be as simple as: ""I am writing this letter to express my interest in the ABC Program of XYZ University."", For the body of the letter, you need to tell the application board why you think this specific university and its program are your best option. You also need to explain why the program should accept you over other potential candidates.


Refer to the note you took previously regarding your own motivations and qualifications.
Explain why the school should choose you. Describe your past academic and professional experiences as they apply to the program you're interested in. You need to provide facts here, but you also need to show how those facts affected you as a person.

For example, you might mention how you reacted to the topic courses at an earlier academic level, like undergraduate school. Instead of merely stating that you took courses in the topic, describe how the content of those courses left you feeling fascinated, determined, or curious.


Explain why you chose this school, program, and location. Most universities are interested in accepting students who have a strong passion or motivation for attending.Note your professional goals and why you think this program offers you the best chance of achieving them. You can refer to the program's common selling points as long as you don't quote them directly.
Indicate what appeals to you about the university itself. If you'll be an international student, you should also describe why you're interested in studying within the applicable country in particular. For example, if the school is located in Germany, explain why you wish to pursue graduate studies in Germany.



, While demonstrating why you're a good fit for the program, you'll need to cite academic experiences, personal qualities, and other related experiences. Focus on the points most directly related to the program itself.


Consult your CV, but don't copy it. Typically, you'll need to include a copy of your Curriculum Vitae (CV) in the application paperwork that accompanies your motivation letter. You can use information from your CV to trigger your memory while writing, but the letter should not be an exact duplication of the CV itself. If necessary, refer the reader of your letter to the CV to provide any supporting detail you cannot concisely list within the letter itself.
Support your claims. Each time you mention one of your strengths, you need to qualify it with adequate supporting detail. It isn't enough to say that you're a hard worker; you need to provide examples of experiences demonstrating that idea.
Don't brag about yourself. You shouldn't go out of your way to seem humble, but you also need to avoid language that seems arrogant or overly confident. Do this by adhering mostly to concrete fact and leaving subjective analysis out of the equation.

, For the concluding paragraph of your letter, briefly restate your desire to enter the program. Offer a polite expression of gratitude for the admission board's time and consideration before closing and signing the letter.


Your concluding paragraph should be around three sentences long. Rephrase your introductory line and summarize the main points of each body paragraph in one sentence each.
Finish by thanking the readers for their time and consideration, and sign off with a professional closing (e.g., ""Respectfully yours,"") and your full name.

, Remain focused on the point of the letter, using grammatically correct language that describes your intent and qualifications in direct terms. Maintain an active voice and stay away from flowery or muddy descriptions.


Avoid cliché phrases or terminology. Phrases that are frequently relied upon actually reflect poorly on you since using them implies a lack of creative thought. When you feel tempted to use a particular cliché, dissect the idea into its ""why"" and ""how"" aspects, demonstrating the truth of that idea through active examples instead of flat statements.

Examples of common clichés
""I am highly motivated to...""
""I have always loved...""
""My greatest goals are...""


Don't plagiarize content. Even though you used information from the program literature to help you form your ideas, you should not repeat that information word for word. If the program highlights its ""state-of-the-art equipment,"" stay away from the phrase ""state-of-the-art equipment.""
Don't copy form. You might find it helpful to look at sample motivation letters for additional insight into the structure and tone you'll need to apply, but you should avoid copying the form too closely. After all, anyone can copy a form letter and fill in the blanks; you need to show that you're just ""anyone,"" and using an original tone can do just that.

, Your letter should focus on positives rather than negatives. If you choose to describe hardships or challenges faced in the past, emphasize how you overcame those difficulties instead of stressing the severity of the problems themselves.


Stay away from your weak points. You'll probably be asked about your weaknesses during an interview, but the motivation letter needs to sell your strengths.Focus on the future. While you do need to describe your past qualifications, you also need to demonstrate that you're looking ahead at what's to come. For instance, instead of describing your lack of experience within a certain field explored in the broader program, state that you are eager to learn about that field and feel eagerness toward the novelty of it.

, While you need to personalize the letter to show your experiences and your interests, it is definitely a professional letter and should be formatted and phrased as such.


Keep the attention on intellectual motivations. While you may have religious, altruistic, or other personal motivations related to your “heart,” admissions personnel are more interested in motivations related to the “mind.” Emphasize your academic and professional goals.
At the same time, you should stand apart from the crowd as much as possible. Don't generalize your professional goals too much; be as specific to yourself as you can be without diving into your emotional or private motivations.

, No matter what you write, you need to be honest about it. Avoid exaggerating past experiences or other qualifications beyond their actual scope.


On an ethical level, the position you're aiming for should be filled by the most qualified candidates. You need to believe in your own level of ability to survive in something this competitive, and lying about your qualifications can be an indication that you aren't confident about the truth of who you are.

Send the pain letter to the hiring manager.",How to Write a Pain Letter," The purpose of a pain letter is to connect more directly to a hiring manager and demonstrate your skills in a more forward way. The pain letter is a good idea for entry level jobs as well as higher level positions. It will often get your resume more attention than a traditional cover letter.The one possible downside of the pain letter is that it may take more time to draft than a cover letter. This is because each pain letter should be unique to the needs of a specific company or organization. You will need to research the company beforehand to write a good pain letter.;
, Review the job description for a list of issues or problems that the company would like to address. Look for statements like, “We are seeking…” or “Our company needs…”. Identify one pain the job description is addressing.For example, the job description may note, “We are looking for someone who can help us restructure our Human Resources department.” This is the pain you will then address in your letter.
If you are not responding to a job description and are writing the letter blind, do research on the company or organization. Look at their “About” page on their website. Review their client list. Ask yourself, what do they need help with? What kind of problems do they need to solve?

, Think about any skills or abilities you have that can help you solve the problem. This could be past experience in the field or in your education. You may also have current skills that you can lean on in the pain letter when you talk about your solutions to the problem.For example, you may write down, “I can solve the problem of how to boost employee morale during slow season” or “I can solve the problem of employee training on a budget.”

, Pain letters follow a four part structure. The letter should be no longer than one page long, with four short paragraphs. Make an outline for the letter with the following sections:First paragraph: the hook. In the first paragraph, you will grab the reader’s attention and make it clear you have researched the company or organization.
Second paragraph: the pain hypothesis. In the second paragraph, you will address the hiring manager’s pain.
Third paragraph: the solution. In the third paragraph, you will discuss your solution to the pain.
Fourth paragraph: the closing. In the fourth paragraph, you will wrap up the letter concisely and confidently.

, Like any professional letter, the pain letter should begin with “Dear .” The hiring manager’s name should appear in the contact section on the job description. You can also look for the hiring manager’s name on the company website., The hook should praise the company on a recent accomplishment. Do some research to find a recent win by the employer that has happened within the past six months. This could be a recent award they received or a new facility they just established. Maybe they hit a recent sales goal or broke into a new market. Make the hook the first sentence of the letter.For example, you may write, “Congratulations to you and your team at Buzz Company for winning the recent Innovators Award! I was able to catch the keynote speech at the awards, given by your CEO, and was impressed by your company’s dynamic approach to the sales market.”

, In the second paragraph, focus on one pain the hiring manager may be having. Refer to the issues mentioned in the job description. Do not try to address every pain point. Instead, focus on just one so your letter is clear and to the point.For example, you may write, “I can imagine that keeping up with new hires and payroll issues as you expand may be an ongoing challenge. With the constant changes in the market, it’s not easy to keep employees paid correctly in a growing company.”
In this section, do not tell the hiring manager what to do or how to do their job. Simply outline a possible pain point that you feel you can address or offer solutions for.

, In the third paragraph, tell a one to two sentence story that discusses your solution to the pain. Discuss a time when you addressed a similar business pain by listing your actions and your necessary expertise. This will let the reader know that you have the experience necessary to address their pain. For example, you may write, “When I ran the HR department at Fizz Limited, I created a new hire training program tailored to the needs of the company. I also kept payroll in compliance with industry standards and responded to employee needs as the company grew from 10 to 500 staff members.”

, End the letter with a short one to two sentence closing paragraph. Briefly note the pain you have addressed in the letter as well as a gentle call to action about getting in touch with the hiring manager. Include a friendly sign off.For example, you may write, “If HR leadership and payroll accuracy are two skills you are looking for at your company, I’d love to talk in more detail about how I can be of service. Best, .”

, Once you have a draft of the pain letter, take some time to make sure there are no errors or typos. Read the letter out loud to catch any spelling, grammar, or punctuation issues. Circle all the punctuation marks in the letter and make sure they are all correct.You can also read the letter backwards to check for spelling. This will force you to focus on each word to confirm it is spelled correctly.

, Check the organization of the letter to ensure it contains all the necessary information. Compare the letter to your outline and make sure you have all four sections of a standard pain letter in your letter.


You can also make a reverse outline using your pain letter. Write down each section in the margin of the letter to confirm all four are present.

, Once the letter is at its best, send it in an email to the hiring manager. In the email, note you are responding to a job description and include a friendly sign off, such as “All the best,” or “Yours.”If you are sending the pain letter blind, you may write a short note in the email outlining the pain you are addressing in your letter and a sign off like, “Hope to hear from you,” or “Please reach out if my solutions seem attractive to you.”

Include other general provisions.,
Sign the release.",How to Write a Medical Release Letter1," You can set up your letter like a standard business letter. Make sure to use a font that is readable. For example, Times New Roman or Arial 12 point works best. You can address the letter to the doctor or medical provider who maintains the records you want released.


If you are a medical provider, then you might want to draft a form that your patients can use. Set it up as a template, and insert blank lines for information that will change depending on the patient.;
, You need to explicitly identify which doctor you are giving permission to release your information. You also should identify who they should release your medical records to.


You could write: “I authorize Piedmont Medical Practice to use and disclose my protected health information described below to Dr. Caryn Smith, 2222 High Street, City, Nevada, 12345.”

, You should identify what time period of treatment this release relates to. For example, you could have seen your doctor for the past 10 years, but you only want to release information from the past two years. You should specify.


Sample language could read: “This authorization for release of health information covers the period of healthcare from August 1, 2013 to April 2, 2016.”
Alternately, you could state that your release should cover “all past, present, and future periods.”, You can release all of your medical information or you can release only certain records. You should specify so that your doctor knows what to release.


If you want to release everything, then include this language: “I authorize the release of my complete health history (including all information related to HIV or AIDS, mental health care, communicable diseases, or treatment of alcohol and drug abuse).”If you only want to release specific records, then you can state exactly what you want released. Alternately, you could state that you release your complete health history except certain information. State what information should be held back.

, If you don’t give your doctor a date, then they might think the authorization lasts indefinitely. Accordingly, you should state when it expires, which might be a date or an event.You can write, “This authorization shall be in effect until August 31, 2016.”
Or you could write, “This authorization shall be in effect until the date of my surgery.”

, You also want to include some general statements about your right to withdraw the authorization and how the information may be used. This information is particularly important if you are a medical provider who is drafting a template for your patients to use. Include the following:“I understand I may revoke this authorization in writing at any time. My revocation is not effective to the extent someone has already acted on my authorization or if my authorization was obtained so that an insurer can contest a claim.”
“This medical information may be used by the person I authorize to receive it for medical treatment, consultation, or other purposes as I direct. I understand that my payment, enrollment, eligibility for benefits, or treatment will not be conditioned on whether I sign this authorization.”
“I understand that the information used or disclosed by this authorization may no longer be protected by state or federal law.”

, Your release isn’t effective until you sign it. Accordingly, include the closing words “Thank you” and then include your signature as well as a line for you to print your name.Remember to keep a copy of the release letter for your records.

However, if you are drafting a release for a different situation, then you should set the font to something readable—Times New Roman 12-point type works best.


You don’t have to type a business letter, though you can if you want. Instead, you can just type up a form so long as it includes all of the necessary information.
If you are creating a template for parents to use, then include this information as a header: “This form grants temporary authority to an adult to arrange for and provide medical care in the event of an emergency for an unaccompanied minor when it is not possible to contact the parents or legal guardians. Please give your signed form to the trip leader.”, At the start of the letter, you should identify who you are and your child. Include the child’s full legal name. Also identify the adult you are giving permission to seek medical treatment for your child.

Start this section with the words, “I have legal custody of this child and I authorize and consent for Melissa Jones to do the following….” Consider giving the following:administer general first aid
summon emergency medical personnel if the injury is life threatening or requires immediate emergency treatment
X-rays
anesthetic
blood transfusions
medication
any other treatment deemed advisable by appropriate medical professionals

, State that you are giving this authorization in advance of any medical treatment and also include the date when it expires.


For example, you could write: “This authorization is given in advance of any medical treatment. However, it is given to provide the Designated Adult with the expectation that he/she will use their best judgment upon the advice of medical personnel. This authorization is effective through September 1, 2017.”, You should include your signature, printed name, and the date. You should also have a witness or notary public sign along with you as well.You can find a notary at most courthouses, town or city offices, and large banks. Make sure to bring sufficient personal identification, such as a valid passport or state-issued ID. You will probably have to pay a small fee to use a notary.

Crime stories are separated into three areas: Fiction, Non-Fiction and Half-Fiction.,
If you want to write true crime stories, you will need to gather data.,
Research about that crime.,
After gathering all this information, write in your journal or some notebooks, piecing the small bits into a coherent whole.,
Then a choose two or more themes for your story (eg: Romance, Violence, Humor/Comedy, Epic/Heroic, Religious, Friendship or anything that comes into your mind).

,
Choose your title first before the body of the story as the title will help you follow the theme.,
Jot down the sequence/plot of your story before you write the actual scripts, in chronological order.,
List the characters.,
And finally, come up with your story.",How to Write True Crime Stories," The NON-FICTION are stories those that really happened with people who really existed. It is the same with the setting, occurrences. Every detail has been investigated properly, with reliable data and information. In short, it really happened. It's like being a detective, reporter, journalist or a blogger. Next, the Fiction. These are stories that are often created by the author with no sources and no evidence of existence. And lastly, the Half-Fictions. Half-Fictions are crime stories about something that really happened, but the characters (mostly the conversations) and the procedures regarding how the crime was committed is not really based on a definite source but simply just a theory. But I will just teach to you how to write Non-Fiction and Half-Fiction stories (For this is the title of this article).;
, First, choose a crime, make sure it is popular or significant.

, The killer, the victims, the concerned ones and resolvers. Gather every little bit data if you want your story to be more fascinating.

, (If you do this on your computer you can easily print it out as needed.).

,, So make sure your title is appropriate with your theme.

,(This is also called an outline.)

, The name(s) of the Protagonist(s) and Antagonist(s) must be real. You can add/edit names of some supporting characters but this is not recommended.

, Don't just work on it for a day. Write about it for a couple of days or even weeks for your mind to be always afresh.

Read.,
Observe.,
Learn to really develop characters.,
Come up with ideas for plots.,
Get writing.,
Think about all the great books that you have ever read.,
Don't expect to write an amazing novel in one go.",How to Write Well As a Young Teen," There are so so so so so many ways of telling a story - which point of view, how to decide on a title for each chapter, where to set the story, etc. Read at least a chapter of a book every day, and make a mental note of interesting things the writer put in - for example, in Confessions of a NOT IT Girl, Melissa Kantor put in a few of Jan's fantasies, in script format. In The Tale of Despereaux, Kate Dicamillo told 3 separate character's separate stories, which all occurred at the same time, and then pulls all together in the last few chapters.;
, Look around you. Wondering how everyone but you seems to be able to get their hair into an amazing ponytail, and yet you have to resort to telling people you, ""liked the casual look""? Write that down. Notice interesting conversation snippets? Commit 'em to memory. Sometimes it takes years for a story you can actually use them in to come up, but it'll happen.

, Please, please don't resort to every popular girl being a rich cheerleader who dates football players and is super mean to everyone. And the stereotype that all mathletes are nerds has gotten very, very old. Not to say that in every story you every write, the queen bee is a mathlete with no fashion sense(not that mathletes have no fashion sense - another lame stereotype) or anything - that would be, like, an ideal universe and not very realistic(though, if you want to write a story about ideal universes, like a teen utopia, go ahead, that could work). And also, the ...darker-dressed people... have really somehow got this stereotype that their evil. Just learn to create unique characters. Oh, and no matter how much you love a character, don't bring him/her into every story you ever write with a different name every time. Write a sequel instead.

, To be totally honest, there are really only about one hundred stories out there, we just change the time period, characters, details, etc. The Illusionist, Princess Bride, and Shrek are really the same story under different trimmings. It's basically all in the trimmings. Gossip Girl, The Clique, and The A-list are also pretty much the same story line, concept, etc, so is The It Girl. But the ages, locations, and characters are varied, and that's why people bother to read all those series, instead of just paging through the first two clique books and being done with it. It's very easy to come up with one liners, but to find characters to say them and situations to have them say them in can be very difficult. Try to just think of an interesting situation, whether it's Chick Lit or fantasy, and go from there. If you really are having trouble, modernize something(you know - make a Great and Terrible Beauty take place in the 21st century, turn Romeo and Juliet into a Vegas lounge act, whatever floats your boat).

, Pull up Microsoft word(or whatever your computer has) and go for it!

, What was it about them that inspired you? Think about what inspires you or what you want to do and write it as a book. You can make the characters have different names but be based around people who you see in your everyday life. :D

, Keep going back to it and work on it, reading it critically and always improving your technique. Go back to it after a few days and re-read. Like what you see? keep going then if not edit it again!

Vowels are defined by the height of the tongue in the mouth (high, mid, low) and its position with regard to the lips (front is towards the lips, back is away). The tension in muscles when the sound is made (tense or lax) and rounding of the lips (rounded or spread) are also significant when distinguishing one vowel from another.In the Received Pronunciation accent of English, there are 12 pure vowels and 8 diphthongs (also called gliding vowels).Vowels are spoken with an unobstructed vocal tract. When making a vowel sound, your tongue should not touch your lips, teeth, or roof of the mouth.;
, Front vowels are generally described as “bright” because their tone is often brighter than those farther back in the mouth. The IPA lists over 12 potential front and near-front vowels. The four most common American English front vowels follow:: “bit” , “ship” , “grip” : “sheep” , “treat” , and “reap” : “bed” , “head” , “instead” : “cat” , “bat” , “sand” , The IPA distinguishes three central position vowels in General American English. Each central vowel requires the tongue to be approximately halfway between a front or back vowel. Use the following symbols for central vowels:: “curve” , “bird” , “stir” : “syllable” , “moment” , “felony” : “cut” , “glove” , “gun” , When making a back vowel, the tongue is positioned as far back in the mouth as possible without significantly impacting airflow. Opposite of front vowels, these are frequently called “dark vowels” because of their darker sounding tone. American English has the following four back vowels:: “you” , “chew” , “tool” : “put” , “could” , “full” : “saw” , “dawn” , “wall” : “bra” , “calm” , “dark” , Diphthongs combine two different vowel sounds in the same syllable. Separate vowels frequently get absorbed into a single diphthongized sound when people speak quickly. American English uses the following diphthongs:: “wait” , “pray” , “say” : “like” , “sight” , “pie” : “coin” , “oil” , “voice” : “mouth” , “found” , “count” : “show” , “boat” , “coat” , Also known as a stop or an oral occlusive, a plosive is a consonant that blocks and cuts off airflow when making its sound. This blockage is sometimes done by the tongue, though this may also happen in a part of the throat called the glottis.Plosive sounds, and many other classes as well, like fricatives, are usually divided into pairs of voiced (v+) and unvoiced (v-) sounds. The only difference between the two is that voiced sounds, like , cause the throat to vibrate, whereas unvoiced sounds, like , do not., These sounds are bilabial, which means they’re made with the lips. The sound is unvoiced, and is voiced.Examples of include the words “pet” , “pea” , and “lip” . Examples of include “boat” , “bet” , and “trouble” ., These sounds occur along the sloping region of the roof of your mouth behind your teeth.is unvoiced and is voiced. The sound occurs in words like “tree” , “ten” , and “lot” . Words that use the sound include “den” , “dog” , and “dint” ., The soft tissue at the back of the throat, called the soft palate or the velar region, is where these sounds happen. The voiced sound in this pair is , while is voiced.Words that use sounds include “kit” , “coin” , and “cuckoo” . Words that exemplify include “go” , “give” , and “toggle” ., Nasal sounds are those made where the soft tissue (vellum) at the back of the throat lowers. This allows air to move through the nose as sound is made, nasalizing the tone of the sound. All nasals described in this section are voiced, though some could potentially be unvoiced.Some languages have nasalized vowels or consonants. These are usually marked by a special symbol called a diacritic. Nasalized sounds are marked with a tilde (~) above the sound symbol, as in .Some languages may not have a large pool of nasal sounds. For example, the sound used to represent ""-ing,"" , is relatively uncommon when compared to other nasal sounds, like or .

, The nasal occurs at the lips, so it is bilabial. The soft tissue at the back of the throat lowers and air passes through the nasal cavity when this sound is made.Some examples of the sound include “mouse” , “me” , and “minimal” ., The sound is similar to the sound, but unlike which is bilabial, requires the tongue to be positioned on the sloping ridge behind the teeth.Sounds using include “now” , “neat” , and “tint” .

, The sound, also called eng or engma, occurs in the soft tissue in the back of the throat (vellum).This sound is relatively rare among language families. Examples of include “thing” , “hung” , and “bringing” ., Fricatives make up the largest class of sounds. Fricatives restrict airflow when making a sound without completely blocking it. They are generally divided into two main types: sibilants and non-sibilants. Lateral fricatives, though related to normal fricatives, are distinguished from them and usually called by the term ""affricate.""In some situations, the terms “spirant” and “strident” may be used as a synonym for the word “fricative.”

, These sounds occur in the front of the mouth. Air is interrupted by the lips and teeth, which is why these are referred to as labiodental. The voiced member of this pair is . Some examples of you might find useful include “free” , “briefly” , and ""affluent"" . Words like “vine” , “revere” and “relieve” typify the sound., These sounds are made with the teeth, so they’re referred to as dental. , frequently called theta, is unvoiced. , referred to as eth, is voiced, though in normal English writing, both sounds are usually represented by the letters “th.” Some examples follow:


: “think” , “thing” , “math” : “this” , “father” , “then” , This pair of sounds is one of the most common in human languages. is unvoiced and is voiced. Both sounds are made with the tongue pressed to the sloping ridge on the roof of your moth behind your teeth.can be found in words like “tense” , “lace” , and “steel” . Look for in words like “zoo” , “zigzag” , and “zone” ., These two sounds occur at the rear of the ridge on the roof of your mouth behind your teeth. is unvoiced and is voiced.can be found in such words as “sheet” , “sheep” , and “establish” . Voiced examples of can be found in words like “azure” , “television” , and “revision” ., These sounds, much like and , also occur at the sloping ridge on the roof of the mouth with being the unvoiced of the two.Look to words like “chill” , “leech” , and “inch” for examples of . , on the other hand, can be found in “jet” , “judges” , and “enjoy” .It is common for sounds in this class to be called “affricates.” The key feature of affricate sounds is a brief stop followed by the release of that stop., There are many other kinds of fricatives, some of which might only exist in a few specific languages. The sound , as in “hat” , is considered a pseudo fricative, though it is listed with common fricatives. Some other fricative symbols you might see include:, a voiceless bilabial fricative.
, a voiced bilabial fricative.
, a voiceless velar fricative.
, a voiced velar fricative.
, a voiceless uvular fricative.
, a voiceless pharyngeal fricative., Approximants transition between articulators like the lips, tongue, and teeth. This creates air turbulence when making the sound. Two common sound classes, retroflex and lateral , only exist in English as approximants. In some situations, you may hear and described as “liquids” and and sounds described as “glides.”Instances where the or sound are made by a tap of the tongue on the roof of the mouth are sometimes called taps or flaps, like in the words “pity” and “water.”Some languages utilize trills where an articulator, like the tongue, vibrates when producing sound. Trills are considered distinct from taps and flaps.

, Sometimes retroflex is written as and other times as . The English retroflex approximate is made when the tip of the tongue curls backward toward the sloping region on the roof of the mouth. Some words that use this sound include “read” , “arrival” , and “deer” .

, Any sound that is made when air passes on the side of tongue is a lateral. There is only one lateral in English which is also an approximant: .Some words that employ this lateral include “leaf” , “relax” , and “curl” .

, These sounds can also be called semivowels or glides. Both and are voiced. requires lip rounding and a raising of the soft tissue at the back of the throat. When making the sound, the tongue approaches the hard, smooth portion of the roof of your mouth.: “will” , “towel” , “owl” : “yes” , “toy” , and “envoy” "

Make outlines.,
Use symbols.,
Learn a shorthand writing system.,
Learn boustrophedon.,
Practice.",How to Write Faster1," As long as you know how best you remember things, use keywords instead of trying to write word for word what your professor or interviewee is saying. Make sure that you're using an outline that makes sense to you. If you can't understand it later, then it won't be very useful., Make up some symbols for important concepts related to what you're doing. You already probably do this to an extent – using ""&"" for ""and,"" ""+"" for ""plus,"" &c., &c. Well, don't just stop there! No matter what you're doing, you will end up using some words and nouns much more often than others.


Symbols should be memorable, if you plan on writing notes for yourself. Draw from your mental gallery of pictures to come up with symbols. For example, use the symbol ""θ"" from the Greek alphabet to represent ""cell"" or ""cellular"" in your notes. It's a circle, like a cell, but it has a horizontal line, which reminds one of cell division.
Symbols are like alphabets. They should be fast to write. Generally, if the making of the symbol takes more than half of the time it would take to write the word, you need to simplify it.
A great way to get symbols from the alphabets of other languages. Look at them, and store them in your mental gallery for later on. Who knows? Maybe they'll be useful someday!
Symbols should be easy to read, if you are taking notes that will be used by others. An arrow to demonstrate the verb ""is"" is easy to understand. A circle with a diagonal slash like ""/"" going through it will usually mean ""no,"" ""not,"" or ""impossible.""

, This is by far the best way to write faster. Using shorthand, your written speed may be able to, if you work hard at it, reach 200 wpm – the speed of a court stenographer! Gregg shorthand is the fastest and most popular system in use in the United States; if you do not have enough time to learn a non-symbolic shorthand, however, a symbolic shorthand like Speedwriting can still increase your speed to 60-100 wpm.


Gregg shorthand is somewhat phonetic based and somewhat spelling based. It uses differently squiggly lines to designate words. It is often considered better than Pitman for taking dictation.Pitman shorthand is a line based shorthand technique that uses the sounds of speech rather than the spelling. For instance the sound ""f"" is going to be written the same whether it's in ""elephant,"" ""find,"" or ""tough."" Pitman relies on a series of slashes, curves, and dots to stand in for the sounds of the language.Speedwriting is also a phonetic system which condenses words so that you don't write out the silent letters. It uses certain symbols and letters to stand in for sounds (a ""."" for ""the"" or a ""+"" for ""and""). Speedwriting is considered to be more than twice as fast than longhand writing.
Keyscript shorthand is also phonetic. It uses only the lowercase letters of the alphabet, and allows you to write 2½ times as fast as longhand.

, Boustrophedonis when you write from left to right for line 1, right to left for line 2, and you repeat that for each line. If you can learn to effectively read and write in boustrophedon, you can eliminate the time it takes for your hand to reach the next line--something that really adds up over time.

, Practice makes perfect! Write about anything that you think of, all the time. Write in prose and poetry, long- and short-hand, in ""note-taking"" and ""official document"" form. (Practice is one of the few ways that you can increase longhand speed, too, as well as shorthand speed.)


Shorthand is only useful if you have it memorized. Otherwise you're taking more time to recall the shorthand than you would be simply writing in longhand.

Divide the task into baby steps.,
Start each step with an action word.,
Follow a logical progression.,
Choose your words carefully.,

Include a list of tools or supplies needed.,
Provide warnings where appropriate.",How to Write Clear Instructions," When you're writing instructions, you must first be familiar with the task personally. Get all the tools and supplies you'll need and lay them out in roughly the order you'll need them.Write down everything needed. When you write your instructions, you may want to include a list of tools or materials that are necessary to complete the task.;
, Even if you've successfully completed the task several times, it's still a good idea to walk yourself through it before you write your instructions, so you don't forget anything.If you're familiar with the task, you may be prone to taking short cuts. For your instructions, make sure you don't skip any steps or leave out any information your reader may not have.
Think in terms of telling someone a recipe. If you make the dish often, you may be able to simply know by sight how much of an ingredient to add. If you're telling someone else, though, they would need exact measurements.

, As you perform the task, take a moment to write down what you've done. This helps you keep the instructions in logical order. If you're doing the task as you write down the steps, you know exactly what needs to be done and when., Instructions for the same task may be written in different ways depending on who will be reading and attempting to follow your instructions. You'll write differently for teenagers than you will for adults.This also affects your audience's reason for completing the task. The purpose may be different if you are writing for young students working on a project, as opposed to adults who need the task completed for work.

, The introduction tells your readers what your instructions will enable them to do and what the final outcome will be if they complete all instructions. Keep in mind that most people will skip the introduction, or at most skim it, so don't include vital information or key warnings in the introduction.For example, if you are writing instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you might briefly mention that peanut putter and jelly is a wholesome and simple option that kids love for lunch or an afternoon snack.
If you do feel it necessary to include an important warning in the introduction, you also should include it elsewhere in your steps for those who skipped the introduction.

, Each step should have a single action, not several. If you have more than one or two sentences per step, it probably can be broken up into smaller, less complex steps.For example, suppose you're writing instructions on how to walk a dog. A step that says ""Put the dog's collar around its neck and attach the leash"" is a compound step that includes two actions: putting the dog's collar on and attaching the leash to the collar. Instead, write ""Fasten the dog's collar around its neck"" as one step and ""Attach the leash to the collar"" as the second step.

, Every step you write should be actionable. Use verbs that show your readers exactly the action they must take to complete that step of the task.Word your instructions in terms of what someone must do, not what someone must think or know.
For example, suppose you're writing dog-walking instructions and you have a step on the fit of the dog's collar. For this step, ""check the collar's fit"" or ""measure the dog's neck"" are more actionable than ""Know the dog's collar size.""

, Assume that your reader is going to jump right in and start working on the task as soon as they read the first step. Typically they aren't going to read your instructions through all the way to the end. If there's something your readers need to know to complete a step, include that information with the step itself.If there is any inherent danger in a particular step, include this warning with the step itself, not in your introduction or at the end of your instructions when it's too late.
Include guides where appropriate, so your reader will know when they've performed the step correctly. For example, you might tell your reader ""Your dog's collar fits properly if you can place two fingers between the back of the collar and your dog's neck.""

, Use simple language that anyone can understand. In most cases you want to avoid any jargon or technical terms. If you must use a technical word, provide a short and simple definition.For example, if you're writing instructions on how to file a legal brief, you may need to use some technical legal terms. Place the plain-language definition first, then afterward give the term used in the courts.

, Generally, it's better to tell your readers what they should do to complete the task, rather than what they shouldn't do. As someone reads instructions, they're in the mindset to complete the task. If you start telling them what not to do, they might get confused and do that thing anyway.For example, if you're writing dog-walking instructions, it's better to say ""check the collar's fit"" or ""fit the collar properly"" rather than ""don't fasten the collar too tightly"" or ""avoid using a collar that's too small.""

, The pronoun ""you"" allows you to address your reader directly and can avoid confusion. When you use the pronoun ""you,"" the reader knows exactly what they must do to complete the task, and doesn't have to guess.For example, if you wrote ""the lever should be pushed,"" you leave your reader wondering who should push the lever. ""You must push the lever"" or even ""push the lever"" leaves no doubt that this is something your reader must do.

, For some tasks, there will be more than one way to accomplish a step or group of steps. Provide the alternative along with the step so that the reader can choose how they want to complete the task.For example, if you're writing instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you might want to include other spreads that can be used: ""Substitute almond butter in case of peanut allergies.""

, You may have heard the phrase ""a picture is worth a thousand words."" When it comes to writing clear instructions, sometimes a picture or diagram will make a particular action more understandable for your reader.For more technical instructions, make sure the reader can clearly see what's going on in the picture, and the action isn't obscured by tools or hands.

, Some complicated tasks have more than one part. If you're writing instructions for a larger task that includes several smaller parts, separate them into separate sections.If you're numbering your instructions, start the numbering over with each section. The reader following your instructions will feel a sense of accomplishment after completing each part.
Even if your task doesn't have any semi-independent parts, you still want to break it into parts if it has a large number of steps. Too many steps can be overwhelming for your readers.

, If you can't follow your instructions as written, nobody else will be able to follow them either. Enlist friends to complete your instructions as well and let you know if they found anything confusing.You may have to test your instructions several times, particularly if they are lengthy or complex.

, Typos and grammatical errors can ruin otherwise clear writing, making your instructions hard to follow. Read through them backwards and forwards to make sure they're error-free.If you're not confident in your editing skills, you may want to get a friend to look over your instructions for you.

, Particularly if a task requires specific tools or materials, a list can be helpful for your readers. Put the list towards the beginning of your instructions so your reader can gather materials before they begin the task.Think of this like a recipe in a cookbook. Recipes always provide a list of ingredients and cookware at the beginning, so you can gather all these things before you start making the dish.

, After testing your instructions, you may realize that there are hidden dangers you didn't address when you first wrote your instructions. Alert your readers to these dangers so they can take precautions.For example, if you're writing instructions on how to boil water, you may want to include a warning that the pot will be too hot to touch even before the water starts boiling.

Know the idea you want to communicate.,
Write a draft of your sentence.,
Cut out the fluff.,
Focus on nouns and verbs.,
Practice and perfect your skills.",How to Write Shorter Sentences," Before you put pen to paper, know what you are about to say. If you're vague on your subject, think it out. If you don't, your thought process will end up cluttering your writing.
, Don't worry about brevity yet. Get your idea and any important points down so you will not lose them., Many writers say in twenty words what they could in five. Take this sentence, for example: ""In this day and age, many students find themselves faced with a seemingly insurmountable number of homework assignments."" Maybe it sounds intelligent, but as Shakespeare once said, ""brevity is the soul of wit."" This sentence can be cut down to ""Today's students are overwhelmed by homework."" How?

Some phrases can be replaced by a single word. ""In this day and age"" was replaced by ""today.""
Modifiers like ""very"" and ""most"" are often unnecessary. ""Many students"" became ""students.""
Many verbs can be made more active. ""Find themselves faced with a seemingly insurmountable"" became ""overwhelmed.""
Often people use redundancies without realizing it. ""Homework assignments,"" for instance, can be cut down to just ""homework"" or ""assignments.""

, Short sentences focus on actions. The most basic sentences consist of a noun and a verb/subject and predicate -  ""Jane walked"" or ""Max barked,"" for example. While a whole passage of these sentences would be awkward and childish-sounding, they serve as a basis for quality short sentences - ""Jane walked to work that day,"" or ""Max barked at something outside."", Brevity is something you need to develop. One exercise you could try is limiting yourself to a certain number of words - the ""six-word story"" is one popular variant of this. As the name implies, you must tell a story, usually your life story, in exactly six words. Reading the work of masters of the short sentence, such as Ernest Hemingway, could also help. And above all, practice."

Choose simple words that rhyme well.,
Give yourself a word limit.,
Don’t be afraid to make up words.",How to Write Like Dr. Seuss1," Kids love to read rhymes. They’re a fun way for kids to feel as if they’re interacting with the text and also help to develop phonemic awareness. When deciding what words to use in your book, pick ones that will lend themselves easily to rhymes such as cat, hat, mat, rat, sat, pat. , Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat uses a total of just 236 words. Using constraints like word limits can boost your creativity and force you to choose your language carefully. Try giving yourself a word limit of around 200-400 words and challenge yourself to pick simple words that lend themselves easily to repetition and rhyme. , Part of what makes reading Dr. Seuss so entertaining is his use of made up words such as glipputy-glup, schloppity-schlopp, sneetches, and wumbus. Made up words are great for kids because they let them see that language can be fun, silly, and creative. Plus, made up words can often be funnier than real words, which helps kids stay engaged with the text.


For a fun exercise, try making up a word starting with every letter of the alphabet. Arkity-ark, blooble, callywickle – don’t worry about them sounding good, just let loose and write!
Made up words also help children develop awareness of the sounds of different letters. Nonsensical words challenge kids to figure out the phonetics of the word with no prior knowledge of the word’s use in common speech. "

Set a timer.,
Write for clarity not quality.,
Get a writing buddy.",How to Write Faster2," This is incredibly important if you've got a deadline coming up. You won't have anything to write if you haven't already done your research before it's time to write. Once you have the research out of the way, the writing part is actually really easy.

, Think about what you want to write and what you're trying to get across. This can be as messy and vague as you need it to be as long as it helps you format your writing before you start. Remember, this is only your first draft, so the outline and the draft can change once it's written.If you're writing an essay, map out your thesis statement, and provide keywords for each topic you're covering, or each paragraph.
For an article, you could map out your writing by subheadings.
For a novel, you could outline your writing by chapter or by plot, depending on how in-depth you need it to be.

, You're not going to get anything written if you're constantly being interrupted, or you keep getting distracted by people watching. You know what works best for you. If you work best with a bunch of people around you go to a cafe, or the library. If you need some background music, put on something that either inspires you, or doesn't distract you (music without vocals is usually best for this).


Use a program like RescueTimeto minimize your time spent on Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, etc. If you can't constantly mess around online, you'll have more time to spend writing.
Turn your phone off. It's incredibly unlikely that you're going to have an emergency in the couple hours you're going to spend writing. Get that distraction out of the way!

, While this can be incredibly irritating and stressful it will help you get finished with your writing and do so quickly. You probably have a good idea how long it will take you to write an article, essay, or chapter without distractions.


You don't even have to use an actual timer. If you've made a batch of cookies, your timer is the cookies. That way you'll get a treat at the end of your writing.
If you can, write while on the bus or the metro. This way you'll have to have something written by the time you get to your stop.

, When you're trying to get something written quickly, you need to stop worrying about the quality of it. Focus on getting it written before you focus on cleaning it up. It's easier to edit something when you actually have something written.Turn off spellcheck while you write. You can turn it back on once you've finished, but while you're just getting words on the page, it will only slow you down.
Don't worry about your own personal voice (even if you're writing a story or poem). All that will come through when you polish it. Or, if you're writing a news story or essay, you don't particularly need a personal style as long as it is clear what you're writing.

, Especially get someone who has to write something, too. For instance, if you're both participating in National Novel Writing Month, or you both have the same class. Having someone else paying attention to how quickly you're churning out words will hold you accountable and it will keep you motivated.


Make sure that your writing buddy won't just distract you. You need to pick someone who is as dedicated to getting it done as you are.

Are these people experts or novices? Knowing your audience helps you choose your words, your level of detail, and the way you structure the instructions.For example, if you were explaining how to bake a cake to a professional chef, you wouldn't have to explain how to fold in the ingredients, why it's important to bring the eggs to room temperature, or the difference between all-purpose and self-rising flour. If you were explaining this to someone who doesn't know how to cook, these definitions and explanations may make the difference between a good cake and a bad cake.
Err on the side of caution and don't treat the audience as an expert. This ensures your instructions are always clear and able to be followed.;
, Before you begin, you want to make sure you state clearly what is required to successfully complete the instructions. This might be a list of ingredients or a group of tools.

, One great way to get clear instructions is to go through the process yourself. This way, you can write down specific steps. If you try to do something from memory, you may not remember everything. Then have someone else perform the task. Ask them for feedback about any confusing or unclear steps.


Be careful not to leave something out. If you skip important steps, you make it impossible for the reader to complete the task. Also make sure you don't write the steps out of order.
For example, if you say, ""Mix the ingredients with a mixer. Place in the oven at 350 degrees,"" the reader may think you place the mixing bowl in the oven.

, Effective instruction is simple. Don't use long, involved paragraphs. Instead, use short, clear sentences, bullet points, and visual aids., Instructions should be full of active, descriptive words. Start your steps with action verbs.This gives the reader a clear action to perform.Each step should read as a command and use the imperative mood.When defining or explaining, use as much descriptive language as possible.
For example, say ""Add two eggs"" instead of ""Two eggs should be added to the cake mix.""

, When you include additional information, make sure that you are including only what is necessary. Ask yourself, ""Does the reader need to know this definition to understand the instructions?"" or ""Does the reader need this tip to successfully complete this task?""


Refrain from adding unnecessary information. Unneeded definitions, tips, steps, or information can confuse your readers, making it difficult to follow the instructions.

, When writing instructions, you should address the reader. Do this using the word ""you."" This helps lead the reader personally through the steps.

, When writing instructions, be as specific as possible. Outline exactly what they do. This includes which way they turn a wrench, how many feet they walk, or what the consistency of the cake should look like when they are done.


Give all measurements exactly. If someone needs to cut off 5/8-inch of a board, say that.
For example, if you are baking a cake, don't wait until step 4 to say, ""Before mixing the ingredients, sift the flour and bring the eggs to room temperature.""

, Transitions help connect the steps to each other. They also help relate the ideas. In instructions, you will use sequence and time transitions. This helps the reader understand the step-by-step instructions.


Some common transitions are: first, next, then, finally, after, before.

, Before you start detailing the instructions, you need to give the reader a brief introduction. This introduction explains what the reader should be able to do after the instructions. It also provides an overview of the procedure. This should be written in clear, plain language.State the purpose of the instructions, who should read the instructions, and what situation might need the procedure.
You can talk about what the procedure doesn't do.
You can also provide background information in the intro.
The introduction can mention any warnings or important information that is needed before the reader begins the process. But remember most people will skip the intro, so don't put anything important in the introduction that you don't put somewhere else.For example, ""These instructions provide information on how to bake a chocolate cake. The first section explains how to combine the wet and dry ingredients, and the second section explains how to bake properly.""#Place the steps in sequential order. Instructions need to be in a specific order. The tasks should logically follow one after another. Step 1 has to be completed before you can move on to step 2. Organization is pivotal for writing instructions.If it doesn't matter which order something is done in, start with the most important.

, Instructions are made up of sequential interrelated tasks. Before you start writing your instructions, you have to decide which steps are prerequisites. This means that you have to decide what has to be done first to complete the overall task.


For example, if you are baking a cake, you have to heat the oven, mix the ingredients, and make the frosting before you can complete the cake., Most instructions contain multiple tasks that must be completed for the procedure to be finished. Organizing the instructions into separate parts for each task helps the instructions read clear and as simply as possible for the reader.For example, if you are working on a car, there are different things you have to do before getting to the engine. You have to place the car on a jack, remove other car parts, or remove covers. Each of these tasks require their own sets of instructions. You should break each task down into a separate part with its own unique set of instructions.
These parts, just like the steps, go in sequential order. You can't remove the engine cover before jacking the car or removing the part blocking it. Parts should be listed in the order that they need to be completed.
Try to keep each task around 10 steps. If you go over 10 steps, find another task or part to break the procedure into.This helps people be able to go back and track their progress. They will know when they have successfully completed a part. Additionally, if they made a mistake, they can go back and fix it without having to redo the entire set of instructions.

, To help the reader understand the instructions, label each section of the instructions clearly. The heading of the task should summarize what that specific task or part covers. The reader should understand the task they will learn how to do before they begin., The sentences for the steps should be short and only include one step per sentence. This ensures that you break down the task into separate actions instead of making each step with multiple actions.


If a step has a related action that must be completed together, explain them in their sequence in the same sentence. For example, ""Before pouring the cake in the pan, coat the pan with cooking spray"" or ""Coat the pan with cooking spray. Then pour the cake into the pan.""

, One important key to instructions is helping your reader track his or her progress. Provide substeps that allow them to see they have done something correct. It might look like this: ""When you have ___________, you will see _________.""


For example, ""When the cake is done, insert a toothpick into the middle. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.""

, For some steps, there might be multiple ways of doing the same thing. Make sure to explain the different ways the step can be accomplished.


If there are conditions which make one step better in a certain situation, make sure to discuss that.
If one step is easier, cheaper, or more effective, make sure to explain that., For some procedures, you may need to break it down further with substeps. Substeps should only be used if they are too small to be considered their own step. Substeps help break down the step into separate parts or sequences of events.Add supplementary information into the substeps. This information gives you further detail about the step, such as what something might look like before and after or why the step is important., If there are things the reader needs to know, do, or understand before beginning the task, make sure you tell them that at the beginning of the step., Think about places where your readers might run into problems. Then offer troubleshooting advice. You can also provide examples of things that might go wrong if they have completed a step incorrectly.


This step is extremely important. If you have completed the instructions yourself, you will already know where you might encounter problems. That's why it's important to go through the process as you are writing the instructions.

, This is very important. Some instructions are not complete when the last nail is hammered or the cake comes out of the oven. Think about what else the person needs to do. If you can think of a ""Now what?"" you still have other steps to add., When writing instructions, make sure to format them clearly. This helps the reader understand how to read the instructions and not get confused.


Use a headings to label each discrete part of the instructions.
Use numbers when listing the steps in order.
Use bullets to list alternatives, additional information, or anything else under the steps.
Visually separate the steps. Place a space between the steps to show a difference.

, The title of the instructions should give an exact preview of what the instructions will explain.


For example, ""Instructions for Baking an Eggless Chocolate Cake"" is much more specific than ""Chocolate Cake.""

, Some instructions require diagrams, pictures, charts, or other visual aids to help. Supplement the instructions with these visuals when needed. The visuals should repeat the ideas in the prose, not present any new information. Visuals are supplement material.


Make sure visuals are near the prose. It should go above, below, or beside the step.

Use internal and end rhyme.,
Be repetitive.,
Don’t sound patronizing.",How to Write Like Dr. Seuss2," Once you’ve chosen a good number of words that rhyme, experiment with writing sentences that use rhyme in creative, weird, and varied ways. Two common forms of rhyme are internal rhyme, which uses rhyming words within the same sentence, and end rhyme, which rhymes words at the end of two sentences.


Internal rhyme uses words that rhyme within the same sentence, such as “There is fun to be done” from The Lorax. Try writing 10-20 sentences with internal rhyme: “There is glue in my shoe” or “I’m in Heaven with Kevin,” for example.
End rhyme uses rhyming words at the end of sentences, such as “Would you? Could you? In a car?” Eat them! Eat them! Here they are,” from Green Eggs and Ham. A great way to practice end rhyme is to write a few poems using potential characters from your story. Try using an ABCB rhyme structure, where the two B lines rhyme. For example: “It’s in my hair / it’s on my nose / but luckily / I have a hose.”

, Repetition gives your writing energy. Children especially love repetitive language, because it makes lines catchy and easy to memorize. Part of what makes the line “I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am” is the repetition of “I do not like.”


Play around with similar repetitive structures in your writing so that kids will want to repeat your lines again and again and again. Don’t be afraid to use questions! Questions lend themselves well to repetition and rhyme. For example, “A boat? A plane? A flying car? Not here, not there, not where you are!”

, Kids will immediately recognize language that reads as too adult or filled with obvious morals. Give in to the silliness of the world you are creating.


Focus on using rhyme, repetition, and nonsense words in a way that is fun for you and the reader. This will make the moral of your story seem more natural and intrinsic to your story, instead of blatant and overstated. "

Mix reality with fantasy.,
Create vivid characters.,
Draw from myth, folklore, pop culture, and travel.",How to Write Like Dr. Seuss3," Part of what makes Dr. Seuss so fun is his ability to create weird and unrealistic situations out of everyday life. The Cat and the Hat begins with two normal children playing inside on a rainy day, and escalates into a life-sized, bow-tie wearing cat pulling two mythical creatures out of a box. Kids love to see relatable, real life situations devolve into complete chaos and fantasy.


Try starting your story in a normal location – a house, school, bank, park – and letting your imagination run wild from there. , When most people think of Dr. Seuss, they can remember some of his most vivid characters by name: the Grinch, the Lorax, Thing One and Thing Two. These characters are so memorable because of their imaginative and wacky appearances and personalities, and also their funny names.


Create characters that are brimming with life, fantasy, silliness, and completely unique traits. Write a list of a few potential character names and some of their physical as a writing exercise. For example, the Flaren might have green wings and wear a rainbow baseball cap.

, Myth and folklore are great resources for learning more about fantasy, compelling characters, and timeless storytelling. Brushing up on some of these classics can help spark your own imagination.


If you are able to draw inspiration from pop culture, kids will instantly find your story relatable.
Travel is another great way to broaden your horizons and expose yourself to new situations and people that you can use later in your writing. "

, How much time are you given to finish the assignment? Knowing this will help you manage your time wisely.

, Carefully look over your assignment. Make a list of sections that define what you need to accomplish, questions that need to be answered, and details you need to include. Brainstorm what steps you need to take to write this assignment as well as possible. Take these ideas and prioritise the most important things which would stop you from writing the assignment if you didn't do them.

, Consider your deadline and what you need to accomplish in that amount of time. Decide how much time you will spend on each section. Sections you have a good grasp on should be allowed less time than those you need to think more about. Divide your time in a way that allows you to complete the assignment on time and answer all sections.

, . What way do you work best when writing. Do you write best if you develop a really detailed plan then write the essay in one go. Or does this make you feel overwhelmed and you prefer writing in shorter sections, say 500/700 words and doing this more often. Do you find your writing is better if you don't write it all in one go?

, This is crucial to working efficiently.


Start by creating a calm environment: tidying your study, collecting all your materials together, listening to classical music.
Follow or adapt your timetable. Using a timetable makes working less stressful as you are less likely to feel overwhelmed by the assignment.
Take time off. Taking time off to socialise, be with your partner, or do things you enjoy is particularly important when you have a lot of work. This will make you feel more resourced so you can work more efficiently under pressure.
Exercise.
Stop procrastinating. Just get on with the work. Procrastinating can cause more anxiety than simply getting on with your work. When procrastinating it can be useful to try doing something else. So if you are stuck writing, try reading, or planning.

, This is the statement that expresses your opinion on the topic.

, List all the reasons you can think of for having the opinion you expressed in your thesis. Then list all the reasons you can think of against that opinion. This will help you find any possible faults in your argument and support your thesis in your writing.

, Put your thesis and all other sections or questions that need to be answered in an order that flows well as a whole. Fill in each section with as many details as you can that help answer the question. These do not need to be in complete sentences. If any research sources are used, cite them here.

, Now that you have all your ideas organized in a manner that flows well and answers all the questions of the assignment, you can begin writing. You already have your ideas in order (with citations, if applicable), so all you need to do is make your notes into sentences. If you are stuck maybe it is because you feel overwhelmed in which case focus on individual paragraphs, rather than trying to tackle the whole essay.

, Sometimes the hardest part of writing is getting started. Don’t worry about your introduction until after you have written the body of your assignment. Once that is finished, it will be easier for you to pull out the main ideas and put them into an effective introduction that summarizes what you will talk about in your assignment.

, When you have finished writing, read over your assignment to make sure there are no mistakes in spelling, grammar, or details. If you left something out, misspelled something, or need to rearrange a section, this is your chance to revise.

, When you have spent so much time writing something it can be hard seeing what final adjustments need to be made. Send it off to someone who's advice you trust.

, If time allows, draft another copy of your assignment, fixing any problems you found during proofreading. Make it as clear and as polished as you can.

, Reading more, especially difficult books can vastly improve the speed you write at.

Copy the Masters.",How to Write Effective Headlines," A successful headline has 4 very important jobs to accomplish:


Get attention.
Select an audience.
Deliver a complete message.
Draw the reader into the body copy. Most people skim-read, so your headline has only an instant to capture your reader's attention.;
, On a subconscious level, we have learned to recognize the ""shape"" of words. If your words are all in capital block letters, they appear as RECTANGULAR BLOCKS OF PRINT, and a person quickly skimming a page will miss your entire message.

, Periods, commas, explanation marks, quotations and even question marks act as ""full-stops"" to the reader. You don't want anything to stop the reader's flow from advancing from your headline directly into the main body of the ad. The best headlines will appear as though the headline is merely the first half of a longer sentence, thus the reader does not stop reading to discover more. You do not win awards for proper prose and grammar in advertising. Your goal is to keep the client reading to toward a decision concerning your offer.

, Do not use abbreviations, technical jargon, or hard to understand words. A well written headline and the following copy, should be written at a grade 7 reading level.

, Deciding to spend one's hard earned dollars is serious business. People demand precise facts and a guarantee that one is receiving the best merchandise for the dollar. Today's consumer has zero patience at any hint of a condescending, dancing, juggling, singing entertaining sales person.

, Do not be fooled into believing word-play, puns or ""cute"" copy has any place in a headline. Humor is exceedingly difficult to pull off in advertising with profitable results.

, The best typeface for both headline and copy, are fonts people are already accustomed to reading. These fonts include the Century family, Caslon, Baskerville, and Jenson, to ""mirror"" the exact same font as the editorial content of the publication in which you are advertising. If you get creative with fonts, colors, negatives (white type on black background) plus the vast array of other options now available with computers, you will only ""lower"" readership, and by a great margin! It is a myth that fancy headlines get seen above the crowd, and thus increase readership. If your headline screams out ""Advertisement"", it jumps to the front of the ""Mental ignore list"".

, Try to target your customer specifically in your headline. If you attempt to reach everyone, you'll come across as vague and impress no one. If you have a remedy for kidney stones, then mention kidney stones in your headline.

, Avoid writing ""Blind Headlines"" that reveal nothing about your offer. A headline must stand entirely on it's own merit, without the reader being forced to read on to discover what the headline was meaning. They won't read on.

, Headlines containing 10 or more words with factual or newsworthy information, outsell short headlines. ""At 60 miles (97 km) an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock"". This 18 word headline of a highly successful full-page ad, composed by David Ogilvy (Ogilvy & Mather) was followed by 719 words of factual copy. ""The more you tell, the more you sell"" is true of both headlines and copy.

, Engage as many senses as possible (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) to vividly engage the readers imagination, both in the headline and the ad copy. Remember, ""Don't sell the steak, sell the sizzle"". It's not merely a chunk of meat sitting there, it's the fragrance of hickory, of searing juices spattering and hissing upon the red-hot coals, the succulent aroma of tender sirloin dripping with flavor and the barbecue sauce staining the front of proud ""Dad's the Cook"" crisp new Birthday Apron.

, The knack of skilfully weaving a story through an advertisement helps to greatly engage both the reader's imagination and focus. When the reader identifies with the main character's dilemma, curiosity will carry the reader to the conclusion of the story to seek ""their own"" solution. You want the reader thinking ""I have this exact same problem. Just how did this woman get rid of her annoying allergy?""

, Always include a captivating caption directly under every photo. People always look at the pictures, and a great photo with an intriguing caption, will draw the reader's focus back to either the headline or the main body of the ad.

, A presentable meal served on a hot plate greatly out sells raw ingredients lying on a counter top. If your promoting a cook book, don't show the raw ingredients in a sink. Show the finished product on a set dinner table, with a glass of wine and a fork in hand, and reflect this in your headline. The lead selling benefit is the end result, not all the prep work, cooking and clean up that come first. Keep this in mind for any situation or product.

, Do NOT use a headline or even the top three quarters of the ad space to say anything about yourself, your company, your business name, Logo or anything else related to the vanity of wanting to see your name in lights. A headline's purpose as the gateway into reading an advertisement's copy, must contain a leading benefit; intriguing wordage; spark curiosity or ask a thought provoking question. Nothing else. Save you name and contact info for the fine print hidden down at the bottom of the page. If your ad succeeds, your client will seek you out. The sad truth, is your customer does not in the least care about you or your business. The customer is selfish, self centered and very impatient. Don't allow your grand-standing to get in the way of a client and the job your headline and ad copy must do first.

, Gather as much information as you can about both your product, and your target audience to discover the ""hook"" that can be used in your headline. The best headline is often discovered while working through all the information in the creation of the advertisement it's self. Writing great copy and a winning headline takes work and lots of research.

, When composing a headline, look up every word of your headline in a Thesaurus to find better words, then look up each of the new words you have found to find even more.

, Keep reworking the headline, rearranging the words, and write several versions of a headline always trying to tweak and improve upon it. Then select the best one. A great headline will often take longer to compose, than the entire ad to follow. Try to find a new angle, direction, or twist at looking at your subject matter from the readers perspective, so your headline is not boring and engages the reader.

, A great headline should contain a leading benefit that triggers some level of excitement. This could include any of the following:


fear
a need
want or desire
curiosity
factual news or statistics of interest
or a gripping question.

, Creating an entirely new blockbuster headline is no easy task. Successful copy writers stay close to proven formulas that work, by reworking classic models that have weathered the test of time. The following list of successful headlines, can be used as a foundation to fit most any situation:


""Dear Lord, Please Give Me the Strength to Go On"" (fear/curiosity/great for selling insurance)
""Please God Help My Children Through This""
""How to get your cooking bragged about"" (vanity/curiosity)
""How to save over 15% on auto insurance before Nov 20th"" (precise facts/dead line/incentive to act)
""How to increase the value of your retirement portfolio by 14.55% this year""(precise statistics)
""How to reduce your home insurance by up to 28%""
""Quick Relief for Tired Eyes"" (precise solution to a common problem)
""When Doctors Feel Rotten This Is What They Do"" (expert testimony/curiosity/authoritative figure)
""How A Man of 40 Can Retire in 15 Years"" (precise numbers & facts)
""How to noticeably get six pack abs, and leave your relatives envious"" (engage the vanity of others)
""Can You Spot These 7 Common Advertising Errors?"" (curiosity)
""Are you guilty of these 7 common dating Sins?"" (curiosity)
""Does Your Husband Brag About Your Cooking?"" (vanity)
""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" (double benefit)
""Here's a Quick Quiz for Pregnant Woman"" (engages a specific audience through curiosity)
""They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano, But When I stated to Play..."" (curiosity, story appeal)
""My best friend was so envious after I used this simple facial cream technique"" (vanity/curiosity)

Decide that a quote is needed.,
Contextualize the quotation.,
Introduce the quote.,
Check your format.,
Cite the author.",How to Write in Your Own Words2," The concept of using a quotation may seem like the opposite of “writing in your own words.” However, learning to use a quote the correct way is an essential writing skill. First, you must understand when to use a direct quotation. Use a direct quotation in order to:


Argue against another author’s specific idea
Continue another author’s specific idea
Prove your own point with the help of another author
Add eloquence or power with a very meaningful quote, A quote should never appear all by itself. Instead, you need to place the quote into the context of your essay. Write a sentence or two that leads up to the quotation, demonstrating the need for this particular voice. Be sure to provide the reader with any information they may need to understand this particular quote., The first time you bring a writer’s words into your own text, introduce the quote with a “signal phrase.” This should always include the name of the person (or persons) who wrote the words, as well as the full title of the work from which the quote is taken. Here are two examples:


In his book End of Humanism, Richard Schechner states, “I prefer to work from primary sources: what I’ve done, what I’ve seen” (15).
As Dixon and Foster explain in their book Experimental Cinema, “filmmakers assumed that the audience for their films was to be an intimate group of knowledgeable cineastes” (225).

, The proper way to format both your quote and the citation for your quote will depend on the style-guide you are following (MLA, APA, AP, or Chicago style). The specific rules of block-quoting, citation, and even the placement of the quotation marks will be determined by the style guide you use. (The citations provided above are done in MLA format).


In general, your quote should not exceed 3-4 lines of text. If it does (and it is truly necessary), you will need to use block quote formatting.
At the end of the quote, include any relevant data that you have not already stated, such as the name of the author, the page number, and/or the date of publication. , No matter what style guide you choose, you must always cite the author you quote. This is a crucial step and must never be skipped. Anytime you use the exact phrasing of an author, you must place this phrase in quotation marks and include the name of the author. Forgetting this step is unethical. It also puts you at risk for plagiarism."

, Literary devices, such as theme, symbolism, and dramatic irony, can be used to make your essay more interesting and to express a deeper message. Even academic essays can benefit from the use of appropriate literary devices.Theme: A common thread or idea that is appears throughout a literary work.
Symbolism: An object, character, or color that is used to represent an important idea or concept.
Dramatic Irony: Irony that occurs when the meaning of the situation is understood by the audience but not by the characters.

, Try to write using a variety of locations and tools. For example, try using a notebook and pen at a coffee shop, or typing on your laptop at home. In fact, writing with a paper and pen will make you less likely to copy, and more likely to paraphrase. Try composing a personal diary entry or a letter to a friend. All of these methods will help you to further develop your own writing style, as well as improve your skills of organization and composition. "

Keep on revising.",How to Write a Tutorial," If there is something that you are interested in or that you want to know how to do, it is likely that it is on someone else’s mind too. Brainstorm some interesting topics to write about., If you really want your tutorial to be read, it is best to pick a topic that hasn’t been written about too often. Look online for existing tutorials and see what you will be competing with., If your topic is too broad, you will find it difficult to cover everything important. Many people will lose interest because they need to wade through material that isn’t relevant to what they are interested in. If you have a broad topic, try to think about a way to define it more narrowly.For example, instead of writing a tutorial on how to use Microsoft Word, write a tutorial on how to insert chapter breaks in a Word document.

, Don’t use big words or go off on irrelevant questions. Be sure that the reader can quickly skim the article and get the point.For example, if you are writing a tutorial on how to clean up a stain simply say “apply dishwashing soap to rag.” Do not give the chemical name for the type of soap and go through a list of alternative soaps and why they don’t work as well.

, Don't skimp on the details. Describe each step as clearly and precisely as possible. Don’t leave anything to the imagination., Pretend that you are having a conversation with a friend. Try not to sound like you are talking down to the reader or that you believe you are smarter than them. Make your writing seem natural; like something you would say out loud when speaking to someone.Say something like “write useful notes in the margin” instead of “enumerate analytical and thematic observations on adjacent pieces of the text.”

, Some of the material in your tutorial may be protected by a copyright. If you use images, information, or other materials from another source, then you will need to credit that source. Otherwise you may be violating copyright laws, not to mention the ethical implications of taking credit for someone else's work, images, and/or ideas.

, It will be a lot easier to follow your directions if you have pictures or videos that show what you are doing. Screenshots are often good illustrations. Try to have an image for each step.


To take screenshots press Print screen and Ctrl. You can clean them up in a photo editing software program like Photoshop or Gimp. Some programs will allow you to write additional directions on the image. With these you can, for example, point to a particular button the reader should press.You can use programs like Camtasia or an open source program like Camstudio to make a video.
If you are filming a video tutorial, show your audience more than just your face. Include some screen shots, pictures, or images of you physically performing the task that will help your viewer conceptualize the process., It is good to list several ways to do things. That way, if people have trouble with one method, they have other options.

, For less concrete topics, it can be important to give examples that will make what you are saying clearer. Don’t, however, let your article become overburdened with examples so that it becomes long or bulky.


If, for example, you are writing a tutorial about how to introduce yourself to new people, you could provide several examples of specific things you could say to break the ice.

, People are more likely to read your tutorial if they know what it can do for them. In the introduction, explain the benefits of learning the skill. If, for example, you are explaining a photo processing program, tell the reader some of the fun things it can do with pictures., If you are doing a video tutorial, be sure to record it some place with few distractions. A basement, far removed from the sound of nearby traffic, is ideal., For any audio and visual tutorials, it is important that you not speak fast. The slower that you speak, the easier it is for your viewers to understand you. Clearly enunciate your words., The title should clearly describe what the tutorial is about. It should be brief and precise.


Consider the title “How to insert page numbers in Microsoft Word.” If you left out “Microsoft Word,” the title would not be precise enough and the reader wouldn’t know which program you were working with.
Consider the title “How to insert footnotes, endnote, references, and citations in Microsoft Word.” Footnotes and endnotes are all types of references and simply be labeled references. So, for a brief title, you would write “How to insert references in Microsoft Word.”

, Write a quick paragraph in which you clearly tell the reader what you are writing about. Explain to them why this subject will be useful. Try to get them excited.


It can help to include a picture of the finished product at the end of the introduction. If you give the reader some idea of what they’re working toward, you’re more likely to get them excited about the tutorial., Each step should be clear and brief. Try to include a picture that illustrates each step. Do not leave anything to the imagination.

, If you find that the step is getting overly long or complicated, ask whether it would be better to split up into two separate steps. You should be able to summarize the gist of each step in a sentence. It is better to have multiple short steps than one long one., After you finish, try following your own tutorial. Perform each step. Ask yourself if there was anything you needed to do to finish the project that wasn’t included in the step. If so, add that step to your tutorial.

, A frequently asked questions section can be a good way to add more information without interrupting the flow of your steps. Consider if there are any terms or subjects that you discuss in the tutorial that might not be obvious to all readers. If so, discuss this in the FAQ section.


For example, if your task involves using a computer program the reader might not be familiar with, you can use the FAQ section to point to them where they can download the program., Even if you are recording a video tutorial, you need to have a draft written out. If you wing it, you will likely go off topic. As with a written tutorial, you should have an introduction and several clearly defined steps. You might want to do a conclusion, summarizing problems or explaining questions your audience might have., Who is your audience? Is the tutorial meant for beginners or for advanced users? Consider what additional information your audience might need to understand your tutorial.

, Even the best writer needs to read a piece several times over to catch all their errors. Try to set the article aside for a few days and then go over it again so that you can look at it with fresh eyes.Check for the basics, like spelling and grammar. Make sure the tutorial flows logically and is easy to understand.
Consider having another person look at your tutorial to see if they can spot typos. They can also tell you if there is anything else you need to add to the tutorial to make it clearer.

, You can publish your tutorial on your website, wikiHow, or on your blog. If you made a video tutorial you can upload it on YouTube.

, Just because your tutorial is published doesn’t mean that you are done. Once you get comments, it should be clear that there are more ways to improve on your article. Pay attention to comments and consider where you can add or subtract to the tutorial to answer readers’ concerns."

You don't have to have every tiny detail planned out; all you need is simple bullet points reminding you about the characters, problems, solutions, and setting. Whether you like outlines, diagrams, or sketches, come up with a general plan for your story and write it out so that you can reference it later.;
, Think carefully about this because this is undoubtedly one of the biggest factors in your book, as it will guide your plot, characters, and writing style. Think about what your favorite genres are when reading, and consider the kind of story you want to write. There are huge differences between science fiction, memoir, and historical fiction, for example, so it's important to choose the genre that best fits the story. Bear in mind that no matter what you choose, there will always be a group of people that are interested.


Don't be afraid to combine genres or choose more than one. Some of the most interesting and entertaining stories out there are combinations of fantasy and historical fiction or realism and sci fi.

, Choose their names and basic descriptions first, and then begin to flesh them out. The best writers think of almost everything about their main characters, about their qualms, traits, hobbies, likes and dislikes, and everything. They create a fictional living being in their minds. Even though some traits may not be expressed in the book, doing this will help you understand your characters so that they come across as more authentic.

, This is where you explain anything your readers will need to know before they can understand the rest of your story. If your book has an extensive backstory (a war, the dynastic succession, details about the setting, etc.), explain it here. Alternatively, use it as a hook to get your reader interested. Inform them of what is about to happen in broad and mysterious terms, or tell them something that happens in the middle or at the end. You must give some information to the reader to get them hooked on, but not enough so that you spill all the beans on the first page itself.


It's often effective, particularly in fantasy books, to have an explicit introduction before the book begins. However, you can integrate this information into the story itself if that works better for you.

, Make sure the plot stays intriguing as you go along, rather than getting boring as characters stall in their quests or wait for something exciting to happen. To keep your plot interesting, consider introducing a big mystery for the characters to solve, adding surprising plot twists, or simply shortening your book so that it doesn't have time to get boring.

, You can have the most exciting of plots and the most interesting of characters, but if your writing style is dull or boring, your book will be, too. Spice up your writing by adding jokes or other humor, using surprising metaphors in your descriptions, or leaving each chapter on a cliffhanger and then resume the story in the next one.

, The title can be vaguely related to the plot or main character, or use something cryptic, a spin on a well-known quote, or a made-up word. Make sure the title fits your novel, but above all, it should be interesting enough to pull your readers in and make them want to read the book.

, Do not leave any holes and gaps in your book. Tie up any loose ends, and settle all the story lines and secondary plots you may have created in the course of writing your book. This will leave your readers satisfied and happy with your book.


If you want to write a sequel, you may choose to leave some loose ends. Don't quite resolve a relationship between two characters, or simply banish without killing the villain, leaving the door open for a resurgence. This will keep your readers interested so that they want to read the next one.

, Generally a novel will not contain many illustrations. However, adding one will make your book exciting to read and will give the readers something to think about. An illustration will often catch the eye of a reader first, so strategically placing illustrations at various points in the book may make its read-value go up significantly.

, If you've written a long novel then this may be difficult to do all by your self. You may want to take help from a computer or a few of your friends. Proof-reading should be done lots of times to remove every single error that may pop up. Distinguished authors get their books proof-read several dozens of times.

, Ask a few of your friends and family to try out your book. If you get positive feedback then consider publishing your book, or writing more.

Role play a storyline.,
Research in depth.,
Write using appropriate language.,
Use short sentences for effect.,
Allow your characters to have real attributes.",How to Write an Engaging Story," Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, temperature. All these senses provide anchor points with which to relate to the story, the characters and its setting. Put simply, it makes the story more real. Too many writers can ""see"" what they are describing in their mind's eye, but they give us few if any sense-anchors to see it ourselves.;
, Character development is crucial. Too often authors have a conversation between ill-defined characters where each speaker is a cardboard reflection of the other and both have the same ""voice"". Two ways of developing characters are populating and planning:


Populate your characters with real people you know then put them in a situation and see how they write content for you.
Otherwise, try planning. When sketching your plot, establish some characters. Have some cups, one filled with traits (tall, hairy, lanky, short) and one with flaws. Take some from each and see how this influences your plot ideas.

, For example, if you're obsessed with describing exteriors without describing feelings, you'll lose the readers who would like to see feeling explored more. On the other hand, if all you do is describe feelings and get stuck on writing an internal monologue, you'll lose the interest of those readers who want the characters to spring into action and do something. Avoid putting your readers through Sleepless in Seattle on endless loop, or the Rocky movies on a loop. Find a balanced approach suited to the genre in which you're writing, to capture a broader readership.

, Here is Tolkien's description of Aragorn at Bree: ""a shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes"". While earlier description on the same page hints that Aragorn might be tall, it is the reader who decides Aragorn's jawline, nose, physique and height. The beauty of this from an authoring/marketing perspective is that the reader paints these pieces of blank canvas and becomes attached to their creation. It is the reader's emotional investment in your work. If you describe everything absolutely, and readers don't like it, their only choice might be to leave.

, Some words describe, others do the same but carry implications of emotions or sense with them. Invade the senses of your readers as the chocolate sauce of your words invades the vanilla pages they turn.

, Got an awkward scene? Set it up as a roleplay for friends and maybe de-identify the characters. Let your friends play it through and get ideas from where it goes. When Tolkien wrote about Aragorn at Bree, he had no idea of his eventual significance to the finished plot.

, If you are mirroring a period of actual history or creating a fantasy world with historical equivalents, do your research; more importantly, get it right. For example, bathing was rare in western Europe for centuries, so stories set in this period should have a big ""nose component"". The first fork in Italy came with a Byzantine princess, whereas before this a short knife and hands were the rage when eating.

, Medieval townspeople shouldn't be discussing philosophy and surgery using polysyllabic terms invented after WW2. Read literature from the period for ideas, but decide how you will limit or flavour your dialogue vocabulary so it feels appropriate or evocative of the period. Advanced concepts such as occupational health and safety would be ludicrous, unless that was the whole point (in the spirit of a Douglas Adams spoof).

, Drag readers in. Lock down, then knock down. Short paragraphs can be powerful. ""The thicket exploded into anger and movement and something striped launched at him"". ""Clearly outnumbered, she saw silence was essential -- until that twig snapped"".

, For example, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep, or getting caught flatfooted while taking a pee.

Include raw data.,
Put in supporting graphs, charts, or images.,
Note your research instruments in the appendix.,
Add in interview transcripts or surveys.,
Title the appendix.,
Order the content in the appendix.,
Place the appendix after your reference list.,
Add page numbers.,
Revise the appendix for clarity and cohesion.,
Check for spelling or grammar errors.,
Refer to the appendix in the text of the paper.",How to Write an Appendix," The appendix should be a space where you can include raw data that you collected during your research for your paper or essay. You should include any raw data that you feel will be relevant to your paper, especially if it will help to support your findings. Only include raw data on information that you refer to or discuss in your paper, as you want to make sure the data feels relevant for your reader.Raw data may include sample calculations that you refer to in the body of the paper as well as specialized data that expands on data or information you discuss in the paper. Raw statistical data can also be included in the appendix.
You may also include contributory facts from other sources that will help to support your findings in the paper. Make sure you properly cite any information you are pulling from other sources.;
, The appendix should also include visual supporting documents, such as graphs, charts, images, maps, drawings or photographs. Only put in visuals that will support your findings in your paper.You may include graphs or charts you have created yourself or graphs or charts from another source. Make sure you properly cite any visuals that are not your own in the appendix.

, You should make sure you note the instruments you used to conduct your research. This could be a video camera, a tape recorder, or any other device that helped you gather your information. It can be helpful for your reader to understand how you used that device to conduct your research.For example, you may note in the appendix: “All interviews and surveys were conducted in person in a private setting and were recorded with a tape recorder.”

, The appendix should also include transcripts of any interviews or surveys you conducted as part of your research. Make sure the transcripts cover the entire interview, including interview questions and answers. You may include photocopies of surveys written on by hand or saved copies of surveys completed online.You should also include any correspondences you had with subjects in your research, such as copies of emails, letters, or notes written to or from your research subjects.

, The appendix should be titled clearly on the top of the page. Use all capital letters, such as “APPENDIX” or sentence case, such as “Appendix.” You can use the same font and font size as you used for your chapter headings in your paper or essay.If you have more than one appendix, order them by letter or number and be consistent about the ordering. For example, if you are using letters, make sure the appendices are titled “Appendix A,” “Appendix B,” etc. If you are using numbers, make sure the appendices are titled “Appendix 1,” “Appendix 2,” etc.
If you have more than one appendix, make sure each appendix begins on a new page. This will ensure the reader is not confused as to where one appendix ends and another begins.

, You should order the content in the appendix based on when it appears in the text. This will make the appendix more user friendly and make it easier to access.For example, if raw data is mentioned in the first line of your paper, place that raw data first in your appendix. Or if you mention interview questions at the very end of your paper, make sure the interview questions appear as the last point in your appendix.

, The appendix or appendices should appear after your reference list or list of sources. If your professor prefers the appendix to appear in a different space after your paper, such as before the reference list, follow their requirements.You should also make sure you list the appendix in your table of contents for the paper, if you have one. You can list it based on title, for example, “Appendix”, or “Appendix A” if you have more than one appendix.

, You should make sure the appendix has page numbers at the bottom right corner or the center of the page. Use the same page number formatting for the appendix that you used for the rest of the paper. Continue the numbering from the text into the appendix so it feels like part of the whole.For example, if the text ends on page 17, continue numbering from page 17 when you put in the page numbers for the appendix.

, There is no standard page or word count for an appendix but it should not be long-winded or unnecessarily long. Go back through the appendix or the appendices and make sure all the included information is relevant to the text. Remove any information that does not relate to the text or illuminate it in some way. Having an overly long appendix can appear unprofessional and clutter up your paper as a whole.You may find it helpful to have someone else read through the appendix, such as a peer or a mentor. Ask them if they feel all the included information is relevant to the paper and remove any information they deem unnecessary.

, You should review the appendix to make sure it is free of any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Use spell check on your computer and also try to review the appendix on your own.Read through the appendix backwards so you can make sure there are no spelling errors. You want the appendix to appear as professional as possible.

, Once you have completed the appendix, you should go back into your paper and make sure you cite information in the appendix by title. Doing this will show your reader that the appendix contains information that is relevant to your text. It will also allow them to use the appendix to access supplementary information as they read through the text.For example, you may note an appendix in the text with: “My research produced the same results in both cases (see Appendix for raw data)” or “I feel my research was conclusive (see Appendix A for interview notes).”

End the brochure with a call to action.",How to Write Brochures," A brochure is a valuable, tangible piece of marketing material that is ultimately used to sell. Unlike a website, you have a limited amount of space on which to provide information. When writing a brochure be specific with what you are selling. Don’t try to cover too many topics in one brochure. While a brochure can be used to highlight your overall offerings, it's often good to have multiple brochures. You should have a brochure for each individual product or service.
For example, if you’re a company that builds beautiful custom rooms in people’s homes, like kitchens, bathrooms, living rooms, you may have more success in your brochure if you only cover one room.
Instead of offering a lot of broad information, you want your brochure to focus on one topic. Perhaps you write one brochure on only kitchens. Get specific to one room so you can explain every detail from the type of tile you offer to the colors of the cabinet handles.;
, Pretend you’ve come across your own brochure. When looking at the front ask yourself what kind of information you would want to find inside. Write down and answer any questions you may have. You can use these in your brochure.


Identify your target audience. You want to think about where people will pick up this brochure. Who these people are. Are you writing your brochure to an individual consumer who is looking for a product or service? Or are you writing your brochure for a team of investors and board members?
Your voice and tone and even the information you provide will be different based on who is going to be reading your brochure.
If you’re writing about all the ways you can customize a kitchen to a potential customer, your tone may be more lighthearted and include more lifestyle information. Include info for options on materials and different builds. Focus on how what you offer will make your customers feel. You want to create content that the benefits you can provide.
If you’re writing to more of a corporate crowd, or in a B2B (business to business) setting, you might want to include more hard facts and numbers. Focus on information that shows investors or other businesses how your product will have a positive monetary impact.

, Instead of just providing an overview of the basic features, you want to focus on a specific topic that lets you get detailed. Features describe the product or service; benefits describe how the features will help the reader. Consider including an FAQ section of common questions that you’ve gotten before and provide answers.
Your brochure is a product someone will take away. Therefore, you need to provide enough relevant information quickly and effectively. Your brochure will serve as a salesperson of sorts.

, You won’t be able to fit everything you might want to say into one brochure. Since you have limited space, it’s important to remember that not all your information is relevant. Leave out information that doesn’t directly impact the main product or service.


Leaving out information doesn’t necessarily mean leaving out core marketing materials. You should still include your company’s logo or image, a blurb about the company, and a section on where to find more information and who to contact.
For example, if you are writing a brochure on designing custom kitchens, you don’t need information on what you can do in other rooms. You may simply want to include in your about section the other rooms you offer. Don’t waste space going into detail on those rooms in this brochure.

, Brochures come in many styles and layouts. The most common is the tri-fold brochure. However, you should free to choose a different layout depending on the information you are providing. Now that you have a topic narrowed down, you can begin writing copy. Pay attention to how many sections you need. Create an outline to help you discover how much room you'll need.
In a typical tri-fold brochure, a piece of landscape paper is divided into 6 sections. Sections 2, 3, and 4 are your inside sections and usually contain the most valuable information. Section 2 is the inside flap and usually contains broad information with questions and answers. This information compels the reader to believe that the product will be the answer to any problems the reader has. Sections 3, and 4 typically expand and go deeper. These sections explain the information, affirming the reader that a solution is contained within your brochure. Section 1 is the front cover. This area entices readers to pick up your brochure. It often depicts an image that conjures up positive feelings. The aim of your front flap is to make the reader open your brochure. There should also be a line or two of copy that promises the reader a benefit.
Section 5 is the back flap and usually contains testimonials and coupons.
Section 6, which is the middle back third, usually contains contact information like a phone number, website, and map.
There are plenty of folding types and layouts when it comes to brochures. Some brochures are more like books or pamphlets. Some include inserts or cutouts. Don’t feel like your brochure has to be a typical tri-fold. The organization of information is essentially the same whatever your layout. The front is used to depict a lifestyle that can be achieved by the product or service within the brochure. The next pages contain answers and offers. And the last sections provide incentives to move forward and contact information.

, Whatever style or layout you choose, you need to make the most of the physical space. This means finding a balance between words and images.


While your copy provides readers with valuable information, you don’t want to fill entire pages or sections with blocks of text. No one will read your brochures if you write too much. This is where pictures and graphs help you.
Don’t make your text size smaller to accommodate more words. If you can’t fit what you want to say on a page or section, you’re saying too much.
Pictures and graphs are a great visual way to provide valuable information. You can also include little blurbs of text that explain a photo or graph.

, Your front cover is what will get people to pick up your brochure. An eye-catching photo or graphic is more effective than a bunch of text.


Use a photo that showcases the product or service you are selling.
Depict people enjoying your products or services. Along with a great photo, be sure to include text that speaks directly to the reader. Ask a question or state a benefit that someone picking up your brochure will want.
A tagline and a line or two of text on your cover give readers enough information to pick up your brochure. It also creates just enough mystery to entice readers to flip to the next page or section.

, On the inner panels, use headings to break up long blocks of text. Brochures have limited space and you don’t want to use up all the space with long blocks of text.


Too much text looks intimidating to the reader. Instead of long paragraphs or sections, keep sections and sentences short.
Bulleted or numbered lists further separate the text and make information easy to digest. These elements will also bring the readers’ eyes into the brochure. Use bold headers to separate sections and break up your brochure. Provide different types of content and information for different sections. If you talk about appliances in one section of your custom built kitchen brochure, use another panel or section to showcase another aspect of your offerings like lighting or cabinets. Breaking up your brochure into sections allows readers to compartmentalize information. Sections help the flow of information and keep readers interested without getting overwhelmed.

, Address the reader as “you” to establish a relationship with the reader. Making your copy personal creates a relationship between you and your customer. Talking directly to the reader as an intelligent person will help to keep your potential customers interested.
Your brochure should begin and end with your customer. Before you get into the meat of your brochure explaining all the great things you offer, you should entice your customer by answering questions and overcoming potential objections.
Focus your content on providing information which sells your features through benefits. Cite real-world examples or case studies.
Aim to answer the question of how your customer will benefit from your product or service.

, Your goal is to keep earning your reader’s focus and attention. Cater your content to the type of reader you are hoping to attract with your brochure.


If you’re writing a brochure to generate leads include info that prospects don’t know about your company. Give a brief blurb on the history of your company and why you are different and better than the competition.
However, if your brochure is a sales closer your customers already know your company’s history. Don’t bore readers with information that gives a potential customer a reason to stop continuing on to the next section.
Keep the content relevant to your brochure’s purpose. But also brief enough to not run out your reader's interest. .
Your content should highlight the benefits of what you are offering, not just features. Instead of only providing content that shows your product, include a lifestyle atmosphere. Show how your product will benefit your customer’s life. You can do this with pictures and copy that show people enjoying your product. Explain why current customers are satisfied.
Leave boring specifics out. In your brochure, your readers don’t need to know right away every small detail of how you build a custom kitchen. Your readers will benefit more from how your premiere craftsmanship and design expertise creates reliable products and the right atmosphere.

, Get quotes from satisfied customers to include in the brochure. Be sure to include the customer’s full name, as well as any other relevant information that helps to make the testimonial seem legitimate.


Testimonials are a great way to further provide potential customers with a reason to keep reading. They also back up the lifestyle and solutions you are promising throughout your brochure.

, Direct your reader to the next step.


This could be done by asking your reader to visit your showroom or call your office to schedule an appointment.
Try to create an emotional call to action. Once again, consider using words and pictures to elicit an emotion. People are more likely to act if you can create empathy. If your brochure is selling custom kitchens, use a picture that shows a happy family sharing a delicious meal in a beautiful kitchen. Then, in your call to action, invite readers to contact you to get a kitchen that will make every night as perfect as the one in your photo.

Plan your topic sentence in support of your thesis statement.,
Organize your main points in a logical order.,
Consider how each paragraph flows from the preceding paragraph.,
Use transitions to ease the flow of your argument.,
Check your topic sentences for clarity.,
Clearly state your main idea.,
Hook your reader.,
Keep it short and sweet.,
Make a statement that you can back up.,
Consider making a two-part ""hook"".",How to Write a Topic Sentence," In most essays, the thesis statement lays out the main argument--which usually comprises several points--in the introduction. After the introduction, you'll write a series of organized paragraphs, each of which fleshes out a point that you mentioned in your thesis. The topic sentence of each paragraph re-introduces the point.


Before you can even begin writing, you must compile all of the information you have and decide what is relevant to your central idea. Wade through all of your sources, ideas, and opinions, and select main points based on quality rather than quantity. It is better to have fewer main points that are fully developed rather than many main points that don't have enough evidence to prove them.Each paragraph should start with a sort-of ""mini-thesis"" for that paragraph. Since each paragraph should only contain one idea, the topic sentence will be a straightforward sentence encompassing what each paragraph is about. This sentence will provide a clue to the reader as to what point you will be making in that particular paragraph.

, One idea should flow into the next. Order the information so that readers won't get lost, and don't be afraid to switch paragraphs around if you find a better way to make them flow. Make an outline of your paragraph: map out exactly where each point will fit into the broader picture.As a rule of thumb, build your first and last body paragraphs around your two strongest points. Don't bury your strongest point in the middle of an essay. If your first point out of the introduction fulfills the reader's expectations from your thesis, he or she may be more likely to keep reading to the end. If the final point wraps up the rest of the essay with a powerful, revelatory idea, the reader may come away from your essay feeling more enlightened than otherwise.Put your main points in an order that your readers can follow easily. Consider what information readers need to know before reaching each of your points, and make sure that it is ordered in that way. For example, if you want to use the high production cost of meat products as a talking point to explore the roots of the California drought, you might discuss meat production in one body paragraph, and the effects of the drought in the next.
Consider how the points build from one to the next. Your points may be presented more strongly if ordered in a specific way. When you are planning your topic sentences, write out each of the ways that you could organize your main points and decide which order is the most effective.

, Topic sentences serve as an organizational tool; they help readers follow your ideas as you weave them into complex thoughts. When you have finished explaining one point, you need to take a step back from specificity and begin again with a new thought.


If you are having a hard time connecting one paragraph to the one before it, reconsider how you have organized your points. Have you arranged ideas for optimal flow?

, Consider writing a transition sentence at the end of each paragraph: a few words that link the main point of the paragraph with the point of the paragraph to come. This is especially important if the two points don't follow each other in an obvious, linear progression.


If you're writing an essay about the fast food industry, and you're moving from a paragraph about systemic obesity into a paragraph about factory farming, say something like, ""However, it is not just America's youth that are being plumped with chemicals and artery-clogging fats: the cows and chickens that make up the meals are artificially fattened far beyond healthy weights, fed diets that are inconsistent with their natural needs, and made to stand crammed stock-stuck in dark cages and pens where they never see the light of day as they await slaughter.""
You need not necessarily end each paragraph with a transitional sentence. You can just wrap up an idea with a conclusive statement, then move on to the topic sentence of the next paragraph. A transitional sentence may help you check that your main points are in the right order, but it can be redundant to have both a transition sentence at the end of a paragraph and a topic sentence at the beginning of the next.

, Ideally, you should be able to scan through your thesis statement and each following topic sentence and have a good idea of what the paper is about. Make sure that these sentences are simple, clear, and concise--no run-ons. Once the paper is finished, read over your topic sentences to assure clarity and cohesion among your main points.

, The topic sentence is usually the first sentence in the paragraph, so it should prepare the reader for what you're going to talk about in the rest of the paragraph without being wordy or difficult to understand.


Do not simply announce your topic. Don't be bland. ""Now I'm going to talk about the benefits of recycling"" is not an effective topic sentence--it's too casual, it isn't informational, and it doesn't make the reader particularly excited to read further.
Make your intentions clear without stating them explicitly. Use a fact, a description, or an assertive statement to introduce a topic. Don't tell the reader that you're about to start talking about something; just start talking about it.

, A strong topic sentence should draw the reader into a paragraph and make them intrigued to read more about the topic. Bring up questions in their mind that you intend to answer. One way to immediately hook the reader is to drop him or her straight into the action:


Describe a character, real or fictional. The description can be physical (Sam Collins is tall, muscle-bound, and broad in the shoulder--not the physique one would expect from a three-time world-champion horse jockey.) or emotional (When Sam Collins' father told him that he would never become a world-famous jockey, the boy was crushed; it was all he had ever wanted since that fateful day at the racetrack.)
Describe a scene. Paint a compelling image that will make the reader ask, ""and then what happened?"" For example: ""The Smith family was asleep when the fire started.""
Use a powerful fact or statistic to convey the gravity of the topic. If you're writing a nonfiction piece--or fiction that imitates nonfiction--consider leading into your topic with a compelling or shocking ""did-you-know?"" statement. For instance: ""Every fifteen minutes, someone in the United States is killed by a drunk driver. Think about that statistic for a moment."" Make sure that your fact isn't
Make a statement. Especially in expository and persuasive essays, your topic sentences should make a point that you can back up in the following paragraph. For instance: ""Steak is a staple of the American diet, but the water-intensive nature of the cattle industry means that we may not be able to keep our heavy consumption up for much longer."" Make a solid argument: your research should suggest your assertion, not the other way around.Avoid rhetorical questions like, ""What is the meaning of life?"" You want to prompt the reader to ask these questions, but you don't want to suggest them yourself. Avoid addressing the reader directly, like ""Have you ever wondered what it's like to be an astronaut?""

, Clarity is key. Avoid run-on sentences and do not try to say too much. A topic sentence should act as a transitional gateway to its paragraph: it should be slightly more specific than your thesis, but it should not summarize all of the information from the paragraph. Keeping the sentence short may also aid the flow of your paragraph--it'll be less daunting for readers to jump in.

, The body of your paragraph is meant to prove your topic sentence. Your topic sentence, in an expository or persuasive essay, should put forth an assertion or opinion for which you are prepared to provide evidence. Only state an outright opinion if you think that you can prove it.The topic sentence ""growing your own herbs will deepen your appreciation for fresh cooking"" states a belief, and you can't expect it to persuade anyone unless you go on to make a case for how exactly growing herbs creates this effect.
Avoid using solid facts in your topic sentence, unless they are particularly engaging or they beg further explanation. Consider saving your facts to use as evidence in the body of the paragraph. Ask yourself whether a piece of information is ""Hook"" or a supplement. ""Every fifteen minutes, someone in the U.S. is killed by a drunk driver"" might be a hook: it's shocking, simple, and it begs further investigation. However, ""In the U.S., adults are not allowed to drive with a B.A.C. higher than 0.08%."" is less engaging and less relevant to the main point, so it might be something to save for the explanation.

, Use your second sentence to add emphasis to a point that you make in your topic sentence. If the topic sentence is especially long, punctuate it with a short, powerful follow-up: ""Americans slaughter 31.9 million head of cattle each year and produce 25.8 billion pounds of beef--and a steak produced in California uses up as much water as six months' worth of a single consumer's showers. This is not sustainable."" If the topic sentence is short and dramatic, follow it up with a more informational second sentence. Unless your paper is highly formal, don't be afraid to get creative with your lead-ins to better hook the reader.

Introduce the topic.,
Outline why the topic is relevant or interesting.,
Refer to previous research.,
Make a counter-claim.,
Identify a research gap.,
Continue developing your own line of inquiry into a topic.,
Outline your objectives.,
Explain your methodology.,
Identify the structure of your writing.,
Evaluate your findings.",How to Write a Swalesian Introduction," When writing a Swalesian introduction, begin by setting up the field you're writing about in a succinct summary. This first sentence (or sentences) holds a lot of weight as it sets up the focus for the article to follow. Your lead-in should be brief and clear enough for the reader to understand what the article will pertain to.For example: ""Autism Spectrum Disorder refers to a group of brain development disorders, often characterized by repetitive behaviours, and problems with social interaction and communication."";
, Your introduction should now establish the topic within the realm of real world circumstance or present-day research. This part will flesh out the context of the subject and point to its relevance. In essence, this is where you let your reader know why your own research is relevant, also.You could write something like, ""In today's world of social media, the socialization of children must involve many different mediums and approaches.""

, At this point you may also introduce reviews of previous research undertaken in the field. This will substantiate your lead-in statement and establish your familiarity with relevant scholarly work on the topic. This sentence (or sentences) will connect what has been proposed to who proposed it.For instance: ""American theorist John Dewey concluded that human beings learn best from a 'hands on' approach to education.""

, The next step in a Swalesian introduction is to create a niche for your research, which you can choose to do by making a counter-claim about the subject of your article. To make a counter-claim, opt to introduce an opposing viewpoint, or point out flaws in already-estabished research in the field. This kind of negative evaluation will clear the way for you to establish your own niche within relevant research., Another option for establishing your niche is to demonstrate a lack, or deficiency, of research on the topic. Try to outline previous research and show where this scholarship has missed the niche that you are outlining in your article (e.g. ""However, little research has been conducted on...""). Avoid this option if you have referred to other research in your introductory lead-in.You can also raise a specific question with regard to established-research in the field (e.g.""The question remains, is Freud's theory of psychosexual development relevant in today's social climate?"")

, If you do not wish to refute or undermine established research on a topic, you can establish your own niche by proposing to build on work that has already been done. To do so, you should establish what has been concluded about this topic and use a connector statement (e.g. ""therefore"", ""so"") to connect it to your own work. In essence, you are respecting and continuing a tradition of research within the field., Identify the purpose of your research to help the reader follow the development of your thesis statement. Clearly outline what you intend to accomplish in conducting the research and what the article will convey to the reader. This should be a definitive statement (e.g. ""My study will evaluate the link between anxiety disorders and internet usage"")., Next, outline the methods you used to reach your results. Explain this succinctly to give the reader a sense of how you reached your conclusion, but avoid going into too much detail at this point (e.g. ""I will argue that the use of electronic readers has had an improvement on literacy rates amongst grade school students""). Your full methodology will be fleshed out over the body of the article., It is helpful to detail the organizational flow of your work in the article before the reader reaches the more substantive part of it. Doing this in the introduction will give them a sense of how information will be sequenced and presented as they read further. Outlining the structural breakdown of your work is ideal (for example: ""This paper will be divided into four main sections: Hypothesis, Initial Research,Comparative Studies, and Final Results"")., To conclude your introduction, offer a quick summary of the results of your study. You can also add how these findings contribute to the pre-existing body of research on the topic. In addition, you might consider noting what future research should be done given your findings.E.g. ""These results show that there is an observable correlation between social media activity and test scores in high school students. The results support popular scholarly theories that traditional high school curriculum does not engage today's generation of students. Further research could examine the links between social media and educational reform.""

Understand your characters and their emotions.,
Take a minute to observe the people around you, or run to the window and stare at passing strangers.,
Note that people's personalities are different.,
Find a person who has a personality similar to your character (eg: easily scared).,
Imagine what would happen if that person was trapped in your roleplay.,
Write according to that person's reaction.

,
Pick out the right words to describe emotions, using an image.,
Use other objects to describe emotions, instead of nature.,
Realize that the human body often betrays its inner thoughts without realizing it.,
Use the human body to betray emotions as much as you can.,
Make it easy for other roleplayers to read your character's emotions.,
Think of emotions as people - very cute people.,
Have your character interact with the emotions.,
Limit the emotions that appear in your story.,
React appropriately according to your character's personality.,
React to other characters' emotions appropriately.",How to Write Emotional Roleplaying Posts," Realize that people are capable of expressing the same emotions and feelings. Don't be afraid to use them to help write your characters' reactions.;
, Watch their facial expressions and reactions to people or other objects. Many emotions are most likely crowding their face, unless if they're hiding it. Even the British man with the stiff upper lip has feelings ready to explode inside of him.


Characters have emotions. Unless if they're cardboard boxes that are incapable of expression any emotions, they come with feelings too.

, Because of this, not everyone may show all their emotions. Some may hide certain ones and display others, while others might carefully slide an emotionless mask over their face. The same goes for your characters.


For example, the happy, go-lucky girl doesn't hesitate to throw her joyfulness all over. However, she might hide her depression. The next-door bully tries to shield his feelings from anyone else, but he releases everything - including laughter - when he's with his best friend.

, It would help if you knew that person well enough (eg: friend or family member). Otherwise, you might confuse yourself.

, For example, picture them stuck with a robber grinning at them. Your easily frightened neighbor would scream bloody murder and run around like a headless chicken, right? Your character would most likely do the same, if she has the same personality as your neighbor.

,, While it may be easy to imagine a scene, you might find it difficult to choose enough words. Fortunately, it's not that hard. Let's take a look at a few examples:


If you were to use images to describe joy, you might imagine sunshine, brownies, hot chocolate, etc. Take those images and inject them into your posts about joy. For example:

""She had always wondered what joy felt like, but she no longer needed to wonder. A warm feeling began to tingle inside of her. It was like hot chocolate on a cold, winter night.""
Sadness is another popular emotion. The words in bold will be the images: ""He tried so hard to hold back his tears, but in the end, he had to give up. They came pouring out rapidly like a flood. His screams were the thunder, and his sobs were the lightning, striking suddenly and unexpectedly while choking him.



, Look around you, and select everyday household items. Don't limit yourself. Use your imagination, and be as creative as possible. Examples are:


Ugly green curtains - ""He felt like an ugly, green curtain - worthless and unloved.""
A broken clock - ""The sadness in her heart was painfully frozen like a broken clock.""
The awkwardly clogged toilet - ""Her emotions wouldn't disappear, no matter how hard she tried to shove them away. They were accumulating rapidly in her body like a clogged toilet that refused to flush.""

, The subtle clenching of a fist may suggest boiling anger. A quick flash of sadness in the eyes is more than enough to reveal feelings of betrayal or hurt. This is what makes roleplaying fun. By using the body (body language), you can tell other characters what your character is feeling without saying anything to them at all. The great thing is that they can simply react to those emotions while continuing the roleplay's story.

, Take a look at these two posts. Compare them, and see which one expresses the girl's emotions the best:


First Post: Belinda walked into the kitchen. She saw Mike. ""What are you doing here?""

The first post positively reeks of lameness. It's tasteless, unappetizing, and probably causes the reader to turn away in disgust. You can barely tell what she was feeling.


Second Post: Belinda slammed the door and stormed into the kitchen, her eyes boring in on Mike. Her hands clenched into fists at the sight of him, and her entire body stiffened. ""What are you doing here?"" she snapped, hatred dripping from her words.

The second one is a little different. While the roleplayer never said that Belinda was angry, Belinda's actions suggested it. Look at the way she closed the door and reacted to Mike's presence.



, While you don't need to make them an open book, at least prevent them from being emotionless. There is no such thing as a person without emotions - it's not natural, unless surgery has been done or something drastic has erased their emotions.

, Their personality will be according to the emotion they represent. However, be careful when trying to personify them. Don't get them mixed up with other emotions (eg: Anger is happy).


Let's imagine Joy for a moment. She can possibly be pictured her as a delicate, skipping figure with golden hair and merry blue eyes. Joy could also be described as a happy, go-lucky boy with messy brown hair and rosy cheeks. In this example, Joy will be a girl:

""Joy gaily skipped around me, her musical giggles causing my heart to rise. She blew a kiss at me, tossed me a wink, and disappeared. I tightly hugged the warm feeling she left me. A smile tugged at my lips, and I let it blossom.""



, Remember that you can choose for the emotions to appear invisible or visible to other characters. Note that visible emotions may get confusing, especially since people experience so many. Here is an example of invisible emotions (visible only to the main character):


Fear slides up behind me and grasps my shoulder. I try to pull away from her, but her grip tightens. My eyes widen as Anger shoves Fear aside and unexpectedly slugs me in the stomach. I wince and throw a dark glare at him, but a smirk lifts his mouth.

, Only allow a few main ones (ex: Love, Hatred, Anger, Fear) or it'll get too confusing since there are so many different types of emotions. You can have a few minor ones (ex: Common Sense restrained me) that pop up once in a while.

, It's only natural for him to tolerate his emotions in his own way. Depending on his personality, he will either react to them in the right or wrong way. However, we live in a fallen world where no one is perfect. That means your character can't be perfect either. Of course, he will have to make mistakes once in a while and choose the wrong decision.

, If your character happens to stumble upon a girl crying, he may stop to comfort her or look around for her parents. If he isn't good in social situations, he might awkwardly stand there or ignore her. For a character with a nasty personality, he might seize the chance to steal her backpack or laugh at her pain. His actions will depend on his personality, but remember that people can change.


For this example, let's take a shy, nervous guy who is socially awkward:

Rick couldn't stop staring down at the crying girl. She was tightly curled up into a ball and clinging onto his legs. Quiet sobs exploded from her mouth, and her shoulders were shaking. Rick thought he heard her saying something, but she was pressing her face into his faded jeans. It muffled her words and made it impossible for him to understand her. He wished he was back at home, safely nestled in front of his laptop. Unfortunately for him, he was in an old alley, being hugged by a broken human being.

Practice every day.,
Practice with lined paper.,
Create some guide lines.,
Write slow while practicing.",How to Write Straight1," Daily practice will help you see results when you are working to improve your handwriting. You will want to examine your handwriting as you practice, evaluating your results and making any changes that you think are needed. Regular practice has been shown to be a great way to learn and maintain skills.Many worksheets are available on-line and have examples that you can practice with.
Regular and consistent practice is critical to learning and mastering a new skill.
Practice with both lined and blank paper.;
, Before you begin to practice at keeping your sentences straight without lines, you will want to use lined paper to help guide your writing. These lines will help you practice keeping your writing straight, allowing you to have straighter writing when you write without them.Letters known as “descenders” should have their body sitting on the line while their stems dip below the line. The letters g,j,p,y,q, and j are all descenders.
Letters that are classified as “ascenders” should have their body sitting on the line and their stems should extend upwards, about halfway to the line above. The letters b,d,h,t,l, and k are ascenders.
All other letters should rest directly on the line.

, If you have trouble writing straight without lines you can try adding some of your own guide lines to the blank sheet of paper. You will need a ruler or straight-edge and a pencil to draw your guide lines. These lines can help keep your writing straight and can be erased after you are done writing.


Place your ruler straight across the page where you want to write a line.
Lightly draw a guide line with your pencil.
Remove the ruler. Use this guide line to keep your writing straight.
After you are done writing, you can erase the guide line and leave your straightly formed writing.

, Taking your time when writing can help make handwriting look clean and sharp. Writing slowly can also help you to write straighter, as it gives you time to adjust the slant of your writing as you go. Always relax and take your time when writing to help you keep your sentences in a straight line.Rushing to write can cause your handwriting to slant or look untidy.
As you write slowly, focus on keeping your sentences in straight lines.
Slowing down can also help you learn better during practice sessions.

Find the perfect paper.,
Fill a cup with water.,
Print out an Old English font.,
Pick up your pen.,
Trace the letters on your print out with your pen.,
Dip your pen in the ink.,
Start simple with the letters “i” and “l.” Lower case letters are generally less elaborate in the Old English alphabet and therefore easier to begin with.,
Add curves to your writing.,
Practice the entire alphabet.,
Experiment with variations on Old English fonts.,
Know the history of the Old English alphabet.,
Learn the lost letters.,
Translate your sentences.",How to Write Old English Letters," This is the first step to building your dip pen. The nib holder is the main stem of the pen. They are molded in a sweeping shape and are thinner at the top then the swollen area where you will hold it. It comes in different materials like cork, wood and plastic, as well as straight or oblique.


You will want to start with a straight nib holder and maybe move on to the oblique holder when you start experimenting with different angles and scripts.
Most nib holder are plastic or wood. This comes down to a matter of preference. Pick them up and play with them. Some will be heavier or wider. Choose whichever is most comfortable for you.;
, Nibs are the metal writing apparatus at the end of the pen. They come in different shapes, sizes and levels of flexibility. The mount on the nib, where it attaches to the nib holder, also varies. Be sure that the nib you choose is compatible with your holder.The easiest shape to begin with is the italic nib. This has a single, blunt edge and limited flexibility. This will help you create a more consistent line.
Choose a nib with a mid-range tip size. Avoid one which is too thin or too thick.
The italic nib should not have much flexibility. Flexibility is more suited to point nibs which have two tines that separate with added pressure.

, As you may guess, ink comes in different colors, but they also come in waterproof and not waterproof, and pigment or dye-based, transparent and opaque and various levels of ""lightfastness."" Before you get too overwhelmed, know that dip pens will work with all of these and the choice is largely a matter of preference.


Start with a black ink.
For your first ink, try something with a decent flow. Pelican 4001 is water-soluble and easy to use. Higgens Calligraphy Ink is waterproof and free-flowing.

, It is best to start with a calligraphy practice pad. This paper will be thick enough that the ink won’t bleed. It should be lined to assist you in creating consistent letters., This will be used to clean your nib periodically. It will become ink stained, so make sure that you use a cup which will be dedicated as your drawing water cup from now on.

, There are several Old English fonts available online.Clearly you would prefer to draw your own, but these are helpful tools for practicing. Choose a relatively simple version of the font to begin with. Avoid fonts which looks complicated or have a lot of decorative flourish.


It may also be helpful to search for blackletter typeface is another term which refers to the font which is found in the Gutenberg Bible.Blackletter typeface is recognizable by its extreme thin versus thick strokes.
Gothic and Fraktur are other terms sometimes used to describe the same font.

, You will want to hold the pen by the holder as opposed to the nib. You can hold it just like you would a fountain pen, between your thumb and forefinger. You generally want to hold the tip at a 45 degree angle on the paper so your nib would produce a diamond shape when you move it in the same direction it is angled.

, Start this with no ink at all before you move on to using ink. Get a feel for how to hold the pen and move it over the paper. Test out turning the tip at different angles. Repeat this process after inking your pen.

, Only dip it as far as the vent hole. This is the hole in the center of the nib. Dipping further than the vent hole will likely provide too much ink, which will then pool on the paper.


If the ink seems stuck and isn’t flowing, dip the very tip of your nib in the cup of water to draw it out.
Dip the entire nib in water every couple of minutes to rinse it. This is especially important with permanent inks as it will be difficult to remove the ink from the nib once it dries.

, These two letters also involve only one simple line. This will be the basis for the rest of your practice.


Ink your pen and place it on your blank piece of paper with the tip at a 45 degree angle. Draw the pen in the same direction as the nib is angled until you have made a diamond with approximately equal sides. This is the top of your “i” and is known as a lozenge. Starting in the center, bottom portion of the lozenge, still holding the pen at a 45 degree angle, draw the pen straight down to create the stem, or minim, of the “i.” Repeat the process of creating a lozenge to cap off the bottom of the letter. This time, keeping your pen at the same angle when you reach the bottom, draw the pen up and to the right at the opposite 45 degree angle to make a thin upward tick like a tail. You can also repeat this tick move to dot the “i.”
Create an “l” using the same process as creating the “i.” The difference here is that the minim will be longer by several nib lengths. The trick is to maintain a steady hand to keep the line straight and constant.
Repeat these two letters several times before moving on to letters involving more curves and pen strokes.

, All letters are made of a combination of pen strokes. At this point you will want to add curvature to a letter. This is done by either elongating the stroke you used to create the tick at the end of the “i,” or by changing the direction you pull the pen after a couple of nib lengths.


To create the bottom of a “u,” simply make the same tick you used at the end of the bottom lozenge of the “i,” but elongate it to 1-1.5 nib lengths. Use the exact same process as creating an “i” to finish off the “u.”
Reverse the tick move to create the top portion of the letter “c.” Begin by moving your pen upward to create a thin tick, then pulling it back down at the 45 degree angle to make the top of the “c.” Return your pen to the beginning of the tick mark and pull it straight down for a couple of nib lengths, then 45 degrees to the right for another couple of nib lengths to create the curve. Then draw the pen up to create an elongated tick of about 1.5-2 nib lengths to complete the “c.”

, These few strokes are all you need to be able to complete the alphabet. Practice them in different combinations to complete all of the lower case letters several times, then move on to making capital letters

, There are some which are more decorative than others. As your skills increase, consider adding more detail to your letters.


Increase the size and detail in the first letter of a paragraph or page.
Draw a box around the first letter and fill it with vines, flowers, or your own design.

, Old English, also know as Anglo-Saxon, was the Germanic language used in England between the 5th and 11th centuries. It entered into writing in about the 8th century. The style of writing was largely influenced by that of Irish monks., There are several letters which were used in Old English, which no longer exist in our modern lexicon.Learning these letters will enhance your Old English writing with authenticity.


”Thorn” looks like a “b” with an elongated stem and represents a hard “th” sound and is often used at the beginning of words.
To create the softer “th” sound like in the word “clothes,” the letter ”edh” is used in the middle or end of words This letter is drawn as an “o” with a tick on top, or as a capitol “D” with a line through the straight side when it is used at the beginning of a word.
The letter “ash” looks like a combination of an “a” and an “e.” It creates an “a” sound like in the word ran.
”Wynn” looks a little like “P,” but with the curve drawn all the way to the bottom of the stem and creates a “w” sound.
”Yogh” looks similar to the number 5 and is meant to represent a gurgling “g” sound, which can’t be compared to any sound in modern language.

, Old English often interchanges letters like “j” and “i” or “u” and “v.” Comparing Old English to Modern English, there are quite a few differences.A simple way to change your spelling into Old English is using an online translator."

Reread your work.",How to Write a Satire," Satire writing is a particular genre of humor in which the writer uses his or her humor to criticize some part of human society. The presentation can be harsh or gentle, but the aim is always to draw attention to some flaw in need of correction.When writing satire, it is important to write from the perspective with a desire to correct broken parts of human nature and society rather than a desire to break these elements down further.;
, Horatian satire is gentle, and the general idea is to persuade people to fix wrongs with sympathetic laughter.


Good examples of Horatian satire include The Spectator by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele or Candide by Voltaire. In the latter, for instance, Voltaire creates caricatures of various ideologies to laughingly point out the folly of each one.

, Juvenalian satire has bitter and angry overtones. The general idea is to demonstrate a sense of moral outrage by using sarcasm, parody, and similar techniques to show how broken things are.


One of the best examples of Juvenalian satire is Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal. Swift makes the very immodest suggestion of eating surplus children to ease the economic burden of his country, and uses logical language and arguments of the time to justify the proposal. In doing so, he shows the flaws of the same arguments he pretends to use., Satire is meant to be read. In order for people to really get something out of your work, you need to choose a subject that people are familiar with, even if they do not necessarily know all the details about it.


For this reason, current events are often used as subject matter for satire. You could also draw from pop culture or point out societal flaws, however.
Even though choosing a topic people care about is important, you also need to make sure that the topic you choose is one that you care about, too. Picking a moderately popular topic that you are very concerned with is generally better than choosing a very popular topic you barely even care about.

, You can usually get away with criticizing someone famous as long as you criticize that person's ideas or behaviors and not the actual, physical person.


Typically, you should stay away from making fun of someone's race, religion, or family background. It's also advisable to stay away from disabilities or medical conditions. If that person is constantly drawing attention to one of those elements, however, you can probably still use it as long as you only make fun of it in the context used.

, This primarily refers to ethnicity and race, but on a larger scale, it could also refer to certain medical or psychological conditions. Pointing the finger of criticism at a group you do not belong to could make you look bigoted toward that group.


For example, African-American comedians can usually get away with being satirical about African-American subculture, just like Asian-Americans can usually get away with joking about elements of Asian or Asian-American culture. A white person joking about either group would not get many laughs, though, and would only come across as being racist.

, Politicians are good targets, but so are political parties and overall events within the political realm. Most people who would pick up a work of satire have at least some basic familiarity with current events, especially major ones, and you can almost always find someone who appreciates biting humor on them.


Just keep in mind, though, that you can also almost always find someone who will be offended or upset by your stance on current events and political issues.

, Writing satire about tragic events can be extremely difficult, so you need to exercise caution in choosing the right tragedy to satirize. Moreover, the satire should be aimed at the people responsible for the tragedy or those who try to write it off as being no big deal.


Any tragedy labeled as a “scandal” is usually fair game. The term “scandal” suggests that there is a person or group of people behind the event, in which case, there is also some policy or vice responsible and in need of correction.

, Religion is another iffy topic, and when writing satirically about it goes wrong, the results can range from distasteful to downright dangerous.


The safest bet is to write satire about your own religion. As with other people group topics, people generally take criticism a bit better if it comes from someone “inside” the group instead of someone “outside” the group.
You might be able to get away with writing about another religion if you are writing about a particular public figure within the religion or the leadership of that religion. You can also direct your criticism at a sub-faction of a religion that most people of that religion refuse to claim. For instance, not many Christians would get upset at a satire written on the Westboro Baptist Church.

, Self-depreciation is the safest form of satire. Since the idea of satire is to draw attention to something wrong in society, though, you need to do it in a way that connects to something larger than yourself.


One way to do this is by making fun of yourself in the midst of making fun of something else.
Another way to do this is by drawing attention to one of your own vices, when that vice or one closely related to it is one you hope to correct on a broader scale.

, In order to have a valid argument, you need to make sure that your evidence is accurate and factual. Basing your satire on something that isn't true will only discredit you now and in the future. Thorough research is vital.


The way you present these facts is just as important. Typically, you should make sure that the facts are either completely right or completely wrong.Presenting true facts in the midst of sarcastic remarks and ironic scenarios will give your argument support, but weaving in one incorrect fact can put your entire argument in question. On the other hand, getting all the facts wrong, and making them obviously wrong, suggests that you know the truth of the matter and are intentionally getting things wrong to make your point.

, Your audience needs to understand what you are trying to say. Fancy words are only impressive to other people with vast vocabularies, and substituting someone's name for a fake name only works if you provide enough detail to let the reader know who you are talking about.


One way to come up with a fake name for someone is to use a name that is close to the original name while providing details that match those of the actual person.

, Your humor should have an edge when writing satire, but you should avoid being downright vicious, even if you are writing with a Juvenalian tone.


For example, you can draw a connection between a singer's number of breakup songs and her number of ex-boyfriends, and that can work. Implying that the same singer is somehow unlovable, however, starts becoming too vicious to be funny.

, The best satire is very literate and mature. Being obscene tends to make you seem juvenile and childish, which undermines the validity of your argument.


Obscenity is usually pretty easy to identify and stay away from. For example, excessive swearing, vulgar remarks about an individual's mother or hygiene, or implications about one's private bedroom matters are usually off limits.

, Good satire is subtle, rather than being over-the-top. When you make a satirical argument for something, it should be in a serious or matter-of-fact tone.


Even though satire needs to be obvious, unlike other types of humor, it requires a sophisticated and mature tone in order to really work.

, One of the easiest ways to write satire is to take the exact opposite stance as the one you are actually trying to take. In doing so, you can show how preposterous the opposing side actually is.


Refer back to Swift's A Modest Proposal. He wrote from the perspective of someone who used humanitarianism to justify acts that were very inhumane and, in doing so, shined the spotlight on people in his society that used the same methodology in less dramatic ways.

, Another way of putting this would be, “understand the audience of the publication you're working for.” A serious newspaper or media outlet rarely uses satire, so if you want to deliver your work to a publisher that will use it and an audience that will appreciate it, choose a publication that frequently uses satire.


Context is also an important part of understanding. It is much easier to accept and understand satire when you expect to read it, but less so if it jumps out at you when you were expecting something straightforward.

, You might think that it's unimportant, but without a good title, you might not convince anyone to read your satire in the first place.


Your title can also play into the satire itself. Refer back to Swift's A Modest Proposal, which was anything but modest.

, If you are writing satire for a newspaper or magazine, you need a good picture or photo to go with it. Like a title, a good picture will grab readers and convince them to read your article.


In some cases, the picture is the publisher's responsibility, so you may not need to worry about it.
Note, also, that this is less significant if you are writing a book.

, As with any other form of writing, you need to make sure that your satire piece is as perfect as you can make it before you try sending it off to publishers. Sloppy spelling and grammar mistakes can be enough for some publishers to turn you away immediately.


Also note that, oftentimes, your work will be edited even after being accepted. These edits might be big or small, but they are always done with the intention of improving your work. Understand that ""editing"" is not the same thing as ""censoring.""

Choose a direction.,
Practice.,
Make a mirror code.",How to Write Upside Down2," Most people find it much easier to write upside down English from right to left, instead of left to right.This results in texts that looks normal if you turn the page upside-down. However, if you're right-handed, the right-to-left method can lead to smudging or discomfort. You can try writing sideways or at an angle instead, but this is more difficult to learn., Teach yourself to write upside down the same way you learned to write regularly - by tracing the letters repeatedly and putting in lots of practice. Keep working on this, and you'll see your upside down penmanship improve.


Try practicing individual letters first. Once you have them down to muscle memory, start stringing them together in words and sentences. Move on to cursive if you're ambitious!

, Take writing upside down one step further with a small hand mirror. Hold the mirror at a 90-degree angle to the paper, facing you. Now try writing such that your words are legible in the mirror. Your text will be not only upside down, but backwards, and will require a mirror to read easily.

Keep your arm and wrist in the same position.,
Check your posture.,
Properly grip the pen or pencil.",How to Write Straight2," When you are writing, you will make use of many small movements in your fingers, wrist, hand, and arm. By focusing on using your entire arm and wrist, instead of just your fingers, you can help your writing to look clean and straight.Practice by making large letters, drawing them in the air with your hand.
Avoid using your fingers to draw a letter. This can result in slanted handwriting and may cause your hand to cramp up.
Use your entire arm and wrist to form your letters which will make your writing more fluid and straight.

, Although it may seem like a small part of your handwriting practice, using the proper handwriting posture can help keep your handwriting straight. By sitting in the right way, your movements will shift and allow you greater control over your handwriting.Sit down with your feet flat on the floor and keep your back straight.
Place your non-writing hand on the table to balance yourself.
Don't practice writing while sitting on something soft like a couch or reclining chair.

, An important part of improving your handwriting, and keeping it straight, is gripping the pen or pencil properly. Holding your writing utensil incorrectly can cause you to lose control over it, resulting in sloppy or tilted sentences and letters. Always make sure you are holding the pen or pencil properly when you are practicing writing.Hold the pencil close to the tip, using your thumb and pointer finger to grip it.
Let the pencil rest on your middle finger, near the last knuckle.
Don't grip the pencil too tightly.

Proofread your work.",How to Write a Proposal," You need to make sure that you think about your audience and what they might already know or not know about your topic before you begin writing. This will help you focus your ideas and present them in the most effective way. It's a good idea to assume that your readers will be busy, reading (or even skimming) in a rush, and not predisposed to grant your ideas any special consideration. Efficiency and persuasiveness will be key.Who will be reading your proposal? What level of familiarity with your topic will they have? What might you need to define or give extra background information about?
What do you want your audience to get from your proposal? What do you need to give your readers so they can make the decision you want them to make?
Refine your tone to meet your audience's expectations and desires. What do they want to hear? What would be the most effective way of getting through to them? How can you help them understand what you're trying to say?

, It is clear to you what the issue is, but is that also clear to your reader? Also, does your reader believe you really know what you are talking about? You can support your ethos, or writing persona, by using evidence and explanations throughout the proposal to back up your assertions. By setting your issue properly, you start convincing the reader that you are the right person to take care of it. Think about the following when you plan this part:

What is the situation this issue applies to?
What are the reasons behind this?
Are we sure that those, and not others, are the real reasons? How are we sure of it?
Has anyone ever tried to deal with this issue before?
If yes: has it worked? Why?
If no: why not?

Don't: write a summary obvious to anyone in the field.Do: show that you've conducted in-depth research and evaluation to understand the issue.


, This should be straightforward and easy to understand. Once you set the issue you're addressing, how would you like to solve it? Get it as narrow (and doable) as possible.Don't: forget to comply with all requirements in the RFP (request for proposal) document.Do: go above and beyond the minimum whenever budget allows.

Your proposal needs to define a problem and offer a solution that will convince uninterested, skeptical readers to support it.Your audience may not be the easiest crowd to win over. Is the solution you're offering logical and feasible? What's the timeline for your implementation?
Consider thinking about your solution in terms of objectives. Your primary objective is the goal that you absolutely must achieve with your project. Secondary objectives are other goals that you hope your project achieves.
Another helpful way of thinking about your solution is in terms of ""outcomes"" and ""deliverables."" Outcomes are the quantifiable results of your objectives. For example, if your proposal is for a business project and your objective is ""increase profit,"" an outcome might be ""increase profit by $100,000."" Deliverables are products or services that you will deliver with your project. For example, a proposal for a science project could ""deliver"" a vaccine or a new drug. Readers of proposals look for outcomes and deliverables, because they are easy ways of determining what the ""worth"" of the project will be., Depending on your proposal and who'll be reading it, you need to cater your paper to fit a certain style. What do they expect? Are they interested in your problem?

Don't: overuse jargon, obscure abbreviations, or needlessly complex language (""rectification of a workplace imbalance"").Do: write in plain, direct language whenever possible (""letting employees go"").How are you going to be persuasive? Convincing proposals can use emotional appeals, but should always rely on facts as the bedrock of the argument. For example, a proposal to start a panda conservation program could mention how sad it would be for the children of future generations to never see a panda again, but it shouldn't stop there. It would need to base its argument on facts and solutions for the proposal to be convincing.

, This will not be part of the final proposal, but it will help you organize your thoughts. Make sure you know all of the relevant details before you start.Your outline should consist of your problem, your solution, how you'll solve it, why your solution is best, and a conclusion. If you're writing an executive proposal, you'll need to include things like a budget analysis and organizational details.

, This should start out with a hook. Ideally, you want your readers enraptured from point one. Make your proposal as purposeful and useful as possible. Use some background information to get your readers in the zone. Then state the purpose of your proposal.If you have any stark facts that shed some light on why the issue needs to be addressed and addressed immediately, it's a safe bet that's something you can start with. Whatever it is, make sure what you start out with is a fact and not an opinion.

, After the introduction, you'll get into the body, the meat of your work. Here's where you should state your problem. If your readers don't know much about the circumstance, fill them in. Think of this as the ""state of affairs"" section of your proposal. What is the problem? What is causing the problem? What effects does this problem have?Emphasize why your problem needs to be solved and needs to be solved now. How will it affect your audience if left alone? Make sure to answer all questions and cover them with research and facts. Use credible sources liberally.

Don't: rely solely on generic appeals to emotions or values.Do: tie the issue to the audience's interest or mission statement as directly as possible.


, This is arguably the most important part of your proposal. The solutions section is where you get into how you will address the problem, why you will do it in this way, and what the outcomes will be. To make sure you've got a persuasive proposal, think about the following:Discuss the larger impact of your ideas. Ideas that seem of limited applicability aren't as likely to spark enthusiasm in readers as ideas that could have widespread effects. Example: ""Greater knowledge of tuna behavior can allow us to create a more comprehensive management strategy and ensure canned tuna for future generations.""
Addressing why you will do something is as important as stating what you will do. Presume that your readers are skeptical and will not accept your ideas at face value. If you're proposing to do a catch-and-release study of 2,000 wild tuna, why? Why is that better than something else? If it's more expensive than another option, why can't you use the cheaper option? Anticipating and addressing these questions will show that you've considered your idea from all angles.
Your readers should leave your paper assured that you can solve the problem effectively. Literally everything you write should either address the problem or how to solve it.
Research your proposal extensively. The more examples and facts you can give your audience, the better -- it'll be much more convincing. Avoid your own opinions and rely on the hard research of others.
If your proposal doesn't prove that your solution works, it's not an adequate solution. If your solution isn't feasible, nix it. Think about the results of your solution, too. Pre-test it if possible and revise your solution if need be.

, Your proposal represents an investment. In order to convince your readers that you're a good investment, provide as much detailed, concrete information about your timeline and budget as possible.Don't: include objectives that are vague, impossible to measure, or don't relate to the stated problem.Do: detail responsibilities and time commitments on the level of departments or individual staff.

When do you envision the project starting? At what pace will it progress? How does each step build on the other? Can certain things be done simultaneously? Being as meticulous as possible will give your readers confidence that you've done your homework and won't waste their money.
Make sure your proposal makes sense financially. If you're proposing an idea to a company or a person, consider their budget. If they can't afford your proposal, it's not an adequate one. If it does fit their budget, be sure to include why it's worth their time and money.

, This should mirror your introduction, succinctly wrapping up your general message. If there are consequences to your proposal not being undertaken, address them. Summarize the benefits of your proposal and drive home that the benefits outweigh the costs. Leave your audience thinking ahead. And, as always, thank them for their consideration and time.If you have extra content that doesn't exactly fit into your proposal, you may want to add an appendix. But know that if your paper is too bulky, it may scare people off. If you're in doubt, leave it out.
If you have two or more appendices attached to your proposal, letter them A, B, etc. This can be used if you have data sheets, reprints of articles, or letters of endorsement and the like., Be meticulous in writing, editing, and designing the proposal. Revise as necessary to make it clear and concise, ask others to critique and edit it, and make sure the presentation is attractive and engaging as well as well organized and helpful.Have another set of eyes (or two) read over your work. They'll be able to highlight issues your mind has grown blind to. There may be issues that you haven't completely addressed or questions you've left open-ended.
Eliminate jargon and cliches! These make you look lazy and can get in the way of understanding. Don't use a long word when a short word will do just as well.Avoid the passive voice whenever possible. Passive voice uses forms of ""to be"" verbs and can make your meaning unclear. Compare these two sentences: ""The window was broken by the zombie"" and ""The zombie broke the window."" In the first, you don't know who broke the window: was it the zombie? Or was the window by the zombie and just happened to also be broken? In the second, you know exactly who did the breaking and why it's important.

Don't: muddle your proposal with I believe that..., this solution may aid... or other qualifiers.Do: use strong, direct language: The proposed plan will significantly reduce poverty rates.



, Editing focuses on getting the content as clear and concise as you can make it. Proofreading makes sure that your content is free of mistakes. Go over your proposal carefully to catch any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.

Any mistakes on your end will make you look less educated and less credible, reducing your likelihood of getting approved.
Make sure that your formatting is in line with whatever the guidelines require.

Specifically, does your marketing get the attention and interest of prospects? Are you converting enough of those prospects into clients?;
, Before you can identify your customer's need or problem, you must identify your target or typical customer. Your target audience is the specific customer profile your are trying to reach. This could be people of a certain gender, age, profession, interest set, group, or any other quality that you think makes a customer want to buy your product. In other words, these are the people who are most likely to buy your product and the people that you tailor your marketing to.The more specific you can be about the identity of your customer, the better you can address their needs. Ask yourself, ""Who am I targeting with this product?"" and ""What do they want?""
Look at your current customers. What's the average age? Gender? Education level? Personality? Lifestyle? Hobby? Occupation? Marriage status? Values?, Consumers buy products to solve a specific problem. Your customers will only buy when they feel that solving the problem is urgent.For example, based on customer surveys and your industry knowledge, you uncover a customer problem. In this case, customers are losing time working or studying when their cell phone dies. If they forget their charger, they may lose hours of productivity.

, Think about how exactly you went about responding to the customer's problem. Why did you solve it that way? What make you think about the problem in this way? What exactly does your product or solution do or include?


For example, to solve the problem of dying cell phones, you create a phone charger built into a backpack. Your customers use backpacks to store computers and other work or school items. As a result, the worker or student can always charge their phone.

, Figure out whether or not your product has reduced the impact of the problem you saw. This is also a good place to determine whether or not your problem needed solving in the first place. If sales are consistently low, this may be a sign that your solution was unnecessary.


Over time, more customers buy your backpack and like using the built-in phone charger. These clients also believe that your product is different and better than competing products. You are building brand equity with your customers. To find out more about brand equity, see how to build brand equity.

, Examine your competitors' products and how the solutions that they provide differ from your solution. In other words, look at what your product is able to provide to customers that your competitors' products cannot. What makes your product unique and better? The goal here is to identify a competitive advantage and focus on that advantage with marketing efforts. If this advantage can be sustained, it will lead to higher sales and greater customer retention., The idea of market research is to understand how you market now and how well clients respond. Analyze the steps you currently take to market your product.For example, if you market your product online, you may be using some of the following strategies:


You continually add blog posts, articles and other content to your website. Adding content drives traffic to your site. Your content also keeps a percentage of your audience coming back for new content.
Your site offers an opt-in button for readers to subscribe to additional content that is emailed to them. This group gets a weekly email from you with new content links.
You have an attractive home page that includes a picture of someone using your backpack phone charger. The site allows the user to easily navigate to your content page and to web pages with product information.
You provide an e-commerce option for customers. Clients can buy your product online and receive their backpack in just 2-3 business days.
This should also include information about the sales channels used, like online, bricks & mortar, types of retailers, etc. Analyze how well your product is doing in each of these channels.

, Is marketing doing a good job of getting your product information to potential customers? If you are using blog posts or articles, are they actually being read? Determine if your marketing efforts are actually leading to traffic to your website and then if this traffic is converting into sales. If not, you may want to include ideas for a revised marketing strategy in your marketing report.


Note your market share compared to competitors and market share trends. Are you gaining market share, losing it, or holding your own?
For more on market share, see how to calculate market share.

, The results of your market research should be compiled and detailed in a market report. A market report includes a 1-2 page executive summary and a longer detailed report section.


Your report should include such items as definition of the market size, competitors and their marketing size, as well as estimates of market share.
You can use the market report to make changes to your marketing process. These changes can help you get more business from the time and money you spend on marketing.

, You need to provide a one page, or at most two page, summary of the results of your marketing research. Be sure to hit all of the major points of the rest of your report in this summary. Many people will read the summary first, to get a quick overview of your results.The summary should include specific, numeric details from the rest of your report. These details should be condensed into bullet points and made prominent on the report., The summary should provide a basic account of what your company does, where it is located, what type of employees (if any) you have, and any other organizational details. Also describe your products and goals for your future products or sales.


For example, if your backpack charging company had plans to expand into purse chargers or another similar product line, include these plans in your summary.
This should also include the sales channels being used by your business, as well as competitors and their sales channels. Are you different? Why? If not, do you have a competitive advantage that can be exploited in your marketing and sales efforts?

, Your report should specify what exactly you were trying to determine in your marketing research. This could be whether or not your marketing was effective in content, whether or not it reached the right audience, whether or not it properly informed customers about your product, or any other determination you wished to make.

, Typically, the objective of your market research is to assess how well you are convincing people in your target audience to buy your product. You need to be making sure that you're reaching an audience that will actually be purchasing your product. If you're not doing so, explain why you think this is the case and offer suggestions for different courses of action.


For example, you could be examining how well advertisements for your backpack are reaching college students, as they would be a likely audience for your product. If your ads are primarily reaching adults, who don't generally carry backpacks, this would be an issue to raise in your evaluation.

, This figure represents how many potential customers or visitors to your website actually purchased a product. This can be evaluated with site traffic counters. If this number is particularly low, you should offer explanations as to why this might be the case and how you can improve on it.


For example, if only 1 in 20 of your site's visitors actually buy one of your backpacks, you may want to reconsider the design of your websites, the ease of purchase, or the price of your product.

, Your executive summary should also include a section where you explain whether or not you had any difficulty attaining the data within. This could help explain incomplete or omitted sections or topics. Sometimes, there's no way to obtain a certain set of data reliably. If this is the case, explain why it is so in your summary.

, Rather than just analyzing the effectiveness of past marketing techniques, you should also look at how effective these campaigns will be in the future.Explain any factors that you think might come into play. This can include more people coming online, more traffic coming to links to your website, or any other trends that you think might help or hurt your marketing techniques.


You should also consider the fact that other competitors will arise if you are successful. Significant returns attract more competition, so if you don't have direct competitors now, rest assured that you will in the future. Have a plan in place to sustain your competitive advantage in spite of new entrants to the market.
For example, perhaps you perceive that college students may be carrying backpacks less often as they switch to an all-digital education. You could remark on how this will hurt your business and explain how you will respond to it.

, It's also important to know if the money you're spending on advertising is increasing your revenue enough to make it worth it. Simply total your expenditures on certain marketing campaigns and compare that to how much your sales have (or have not) increased in the time since beginning those campaigns. Keep in mind that there may be a significant delay between implementing your marketing campaign and the resulting bump in sales. Consider the value you are getting for spending your money on advertising., You can conduct surveys on your website or by using a email marketing campaign. You can also get information from focus groups. Your focus group should include people in your target audience.To get the most out of your focus group, carefully plan the exact series of questions you want to ask. Your marketing report should include the questions you ask and why those questions are important to you.
In your survey or focus group, ask people how they first heard about your product. If you’re the backpack company, you might determine that most customers find you when they read a blog post or article that is posted to your site.
Document the results of both your surveys and your focus groups. Your report should provide both questions and responses. Give the reader the percentage of each type of response. For example, maybe 40% of respondents first learned about the backpack company by finding a blog post or article that was posted on the website.
Your qualitative research (survey and focus group questions) may be 5 to 10 pages of your report. The responses to those questions will also be 5 to 10 pages of material.

, The purpose of your market research is to find out what is working and where you need to improve. If you can make the right changes, you can market more effectively without increasing your marketing budget.Evaluate the extent to which your customers view your product as different and better than the competition. If they don’t see a difference, dig into their responses and find out why.
Say, for example, that most clients see you backpack and built-in phone charger as about the same as a competitor’s product. In fact, your phone charger includes a reinforced case that makes your charger much more durable.
Decide on some conclusions. You conclude, for example, that your website needs to emphasize that your phone charger case is much more durable than the competition.
You decide to make changes to your website and your other marketing communication pieces. After a period of time, you can assess these changes to see how they have impacted your market share. Perform more market research to evaluate the impact of your changes.

Once you’re more experienced with cursive, you can move on to special calligraphy pens that have wider tips., The lines will give you guidance as you practice your letters. You can just use regular notebook paper, or print off the sample paper at the beginning of this article. The sample has a dotted line halfway between each solid line to give you another reference point while writing., There are two worksheets attached at the beginning of this article that feature the lowercase and uppercase cursive alphabets. The arrows show you the direction your pen should go when you start each letter. Use these as a reference as you begin writing.


If you want a more detailed guide, you can also search online for worksheets that show the direction that each individual stroke should go., Good posture is important since how you sit will affect how you hold your pen. Straighten your back, relax your shoulders, and sit with your feet flat on the floor., Pinch your thumb and forefinger together to hold the pen, then let it rest on your middle finger. Keep your grip loose and comfortable. If your fingernails are white, you’re holding it too tightly. A too-tight grip can lead to writing that looks stiff., Aim for about a 45-degree angle between your pen and the page. However, the specific angle you choose isn’t as important when you’re just starting out. What matters is that you keep the angle consistent while you’re writing., If you’re right-handed, turn the paper counterclockwise until the top right corner and bottom left corner line up in front of your nose. If you’re left-handed, turn the paper clockwise, and reverse those instructions.Your free hand should rest on the edge of the paper to hold it still.

, Speed will come with time, but you need to learn accuracy first. If your letters aren’t coming out the way you want, you probably need to slow down even more. It may seem tedious at first, but once you have mastered the shape of the strokes, then you can practice them faster and faster.







, In the lowercase alphabet, b, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z all begin with an upward stroke. It’s easier to practice these letters together because your pen will be making a very similar motion each time you start a letter., In the lowercase alphabet, a, c, d, e, g, o, and q all begin with a curved stroke. Practice these together to get the feel of this curving motion with your hand., Uppercase cursive letters are often slightly different from their lowercase counterparts. Wait until you’re comfortable with all the lowercase letters before moving on so that you don’t get confused.While you mostly just use your fingers to write lowercase letters, you should use your whole hand to write uppercase letters. This will vary up your movements to prevent cramping., When you’re comfortable with all uppercase and lowercase letters you can begin connecting them. Once you finish a letter, rather than lifting your pen to start the next one, keep it on the paper. Glide from the end of one letter into the beginning of the next.







, Some letters are easier to connect than others, but the trick to smooth writing is developing a rhythm. In general, your upstrokes should take the same amount of time as your downstrokes. If you’re having trouble keeping it consistent, slow down, then work your way back up to speed.








If you’re using a felt-tip pen, listen to the squeak of the tip as you write. This noise can help you get a sense for your rhythm.

, Like any other skill, you need to practice cursive regularly to master it. Aim to write in cursive for about 20 minutes a day. Even if you only have one minute, you can still do some movement exercises.


Use your pen to draw connecting ovals or connecting curves all the way across the page. These exercises will help to tone and train the muscles in your hand."

A calligraphic writing tool such as a pen or brush
Ink
Paper
A smooth, hard, flat supporting surface
A seat at a comfortable height
You may also want a ruler and pencil (to make lines to write along);
, For calligraphy, you have different pen options. You can use a felt calligraphy pen, a fountain or cartridge pen, or a dip pen. All produce beautiful results with slight variations.


A felt calligraphy pen is similar to a marker. This kind of pen is good for a beginner because it gives you more control with your strokes. Harder tips are more predictable, while soft tips respond to your hand as you get more advanced. These pens can easily be held on a horizontal surface. Choose a fine tip for extremely detailed work and larger tips for bold strokes.A fountain pen has a nib for the tip, but contains a cartridge of ink inside the pen. A fountain or cartridge pen can be used on horizontal surfaces, won't run out of ink mid-word, and doesn't require open bottles of ink. The nib is extremely rigid, so it doesn't respond and isn't flexible. They also leak, can clog, and get messy when you have to change the cartridge. It is good for beginners.A dip pen is the original calligraphy pen, which is related to the early pens made from reeds or feathers. To use a dip pen, you dip the nib into ink. For a dip pen, you need two items: a metal nib and a handle. Dip pens can use India ink, drawing ink, and acrylic, and other inks that destroy fountain pens by clogging. There are different size nibs you can get to make various lines in different widths. You can also change color if you're using different color inks. Using a dip pen is harder, but most serious calligraphers use a dip pen., Because of the kind of ink used in calligraphy, regular paper is not the best choice. Printer or graph paper is thin, so the ink bleeds through. Any type of regular paper can be used while practicing, but if you are completing a finished product, you want to choose better paper.


Look for ""sized"" paper. Sizing means the paper has been made so that the ink won't absorb into the fibers of the paper. This helps you achieve clean, sharp letters.
Get acid free or pH neutral paper. This paper won't yellow over time.
Buy heavy paper. Heavier paper gives a rigid surface for your calligraphy. Calligraphy pads range from 20-70 lbs. Start with at least 60 lb paper when completing any final projects. That's good for most calligraphy projects.
There are three types of paper surfaces: hot-pressed (smooth), cold-pressed or not hot-pressed (some roughness), and rough (very rough). Smooth surfaces are usually good for calligraphy, though a little roughness can help grab the ink. Start with hot-pressed paper at first. Try cold-pressed once you become more advanced and use a dip pen.You can buy calligraphy pens and paper at most art and hobby stores.

, When writing calligraphy, you want to have straight lines to write on. Use a ruler to draw lines on the paper. The height of your letters will depend on nib widths, if using a dip pen.


For practice, draw parallel lines on a sheet of paper 3/4"" apart.If you want to practice upper and lowercase letters, place dashed lines halfway between the parallel lines.
You can also use lined practice paper that elementary students use when learning to write.

, Dip the pointed end of the nib into the open ink bottle. Hold it there until the ink reaches 3/4 up from the tip. Tap the nib on the rim of the ink bottle to shake off any lingering ink.


If there isn't enough ink in the pen, it will run out faster. This will cause scratchy lines. You will also have to stop to refill. If there is too much ink, it can overflow, which will cause the ink to drip or spurt.Hold the pen horizontal after you put in it. Keep it over the paper to avoid getting any ink in your lap.
Test the ink flow of the pen on a scratch sheet before beginning., Grip the pen in whichever hand is your writing hand. Don't grip the pen too tightly. That might cause shaky letters. Make sure you are sitting comfortably. If you want, you can write on a slightly angled surface of 30 degrees.Hold the pen like you would a normal pen.


Although you hold the pen like you do a regular pen, you won't write with it the same way. You will vary pressure and use different strokes than when you write normally.To get the best release of ink, hold the pen against the paper horizontally at a 20-45 degree angle.Keep the pen angle constant as you write.

, When you get the pen filled and positioned above the paper, it is time to write with it. The pressure you apply varies depending on the kind of stroke you make. To make a downward stroke (from top to bottom), press hard. When you make an upstroke (from bottom to top), use a light pressure so that the pen is barely touching the paper. If you press too hard on the upstroke, you will get ink splatter.


Make sure the tip of the pen is always in the same position and facing the same way. No matter if you are going up, down, or sideways, it should remain in the same place. Don't turn the tip of your pen; instead, move and turn your hand.
Lead the nib with your hand. Don't push it.Wipe off the nib every couple of minutes. Dip it in a cup of water and then wipe with a paper towel., Just like normal writing, calligraphy has both uppercase and lowercase letters. Where these letters fall on the page is very precise. There are three areas you need to know when thinking about writing with calligraphy.


The baseline is the bottom parallel line. All the letters sit on this line. Always return to this line.
The ascending line is the top parallel line is where all tall letters reach.
The waistline is halfway between the baseline and the ascending line. On a practice sheet, it may be invisible or dashed lines. This is where the lowercase letters reach.
The descending line is the same width from the baseline as the waistline. This is where any letters that reach below the baseline fall., The downward stroke is one of the two main strokes in calligraphy. It is one of the first things you want to practice and perfect. Before you start practicing this stroke, though, use some practice sheets just to draw lines, curves, and loops. Get a feel for the pen and paper while practicing filling up your pen.


Place your pen at the top line. With the tip of the pen flat on the paper, move your hand downward. Don't keep the line straight; instead, the line should slant to the right if you are right-handed. If you are left-handed, let it slant to the left. The stroke should extend from the top line to the bottom line.
There should be a little tail at the bottom when you finish.
Fill the whole page with downward strokes. Work on improving your lines and getting used to the feel of the pen.

, The basic curve is the second of the two main strokes in calligraphy. The basic curve looks like lowercase c.


Start with the tip of the pen in the middle of the two parallel lines. If you made dashed lines between the parallel lines, start at that line.
Curve your pen down and left. Pull up when you reach the bottom line.Practice by filling a whole page with the basic curve.

, Draw lines parallel instead of downward. Keep the nib at the same angle and in the same position as when you did the downward stroke and curve.


Next, practice making diagonal lines. Make sure to keep your pen in the same position no matter which direction you go. Make a diagonal from right to left. This will produce a very thin line. Then, make a diagonal from left to right. This will make a wider, bold stroke., After you get the basics, learn some letters. Letters consist of a bunch of strokes placed together. Practice stroke basics before starting to learn letters.


For the letter h, start with a roundhand script. Place your pen tip on the ascending line. Make a downward stroke all the way to the baseline. Lift your pen and place it on the downward stroke just below the waistline. Make an arc towards the right and then downward.
The letter a in roundhand script will take 3 strokes. Start a little to the right at the waistline. Make a curving downward stroke to the baseline. The bottom should end approximately the same perpendicular line as the top. Make a short left to right stroke at the top of the curve. Then, place your pen right where that left to right stroke ended and make a downward stroke towards the baseline. There should be a little flourish towards the end.To write a different a, start with a downward stroke from the waistline to the baseline. It should have a rounded flourish at the top and bottom. Then, make a half curve on the left side of the downward stroke. It should start halfway between the waistline and baseline and curve towards the right, ending at the downward stroke. Then, make a left to right stroke from the top of the half curve to the downward stroke. This completes the a."

Set up your header.,
Update your template.,
Fill in the fields provided in the template.,
Professionalize your memo.,
Don't overlook information.,
if you wish, customize the document.,
Save the template.",How to Write a Memo by Using Templates," Your first course of action should be to search online for some good memo templates. This will allow you to find templates for memos of virtually any kind.


Take some time to look around and see which templates you like best. You can then download the templates that best fit your needs so that you can begin creating memos that work well for you. Because there are several different templates available, you can download one for every type of memo that you may need and then you will have those to go back to from that point forward.
If you need to write a business memo template, you can look around the site and then download the correct template in order to create a business memo. You always have the opportunity to preview each template before you actually download it and if you like what you see, downloading is as simple as pressing the download button after you have previewed it and decided that you want to add it to your computer files.;
, After you have pressed the download button, the template will automatically download into your computer or may take few steps to start download. It is downloaded as a zip file, so you need to unzip the file and then open it in Microsoft Word. It is always a good idea to use the latest version of Microsoft Word in order to ensure that you will not run into any unforeseen software problems and that the template will operate as it was designed to function. If you are operating on an older version of Microsoft Word, simply update your software before downloading any templates. This should eliminate many of the traditional problems that people typically have when they download large files because it gives you all of the latest updates.

, Keep in mind that everything on the template is basically an example and you can customize every portion of it to fit your particular needs. For instance, you can add your logo and copyright sign in the header section of the template simply by clicking on that section and then typing in the information that you need to have for your own personal document. One word of caution that you should know before you get started is that it is always a good idea to read the terms of use before using any templates from Dotxes, or from any other website for that matter.

, Click on the section that says ""memo"" and update your template with your own title. Again, everything that is already written into the template is there in order to provide you with an example of how your template should look when you are finished. You can customize your template by clicking on the desired section and typing in your own information. It is equally important to make sure that you have also deleted the words that are there for the sake of example and carefully proofread your memo before sending it.

, Be sure to fill in the ""to"" and ""from"" fields, as well as ""Cc,"" ""subject"" and all the other fields. Use caution when filling these fields to ensure that you have not skipped over any field, leaving some of them blank, or that you have not made an error in typing somewhere along the way.

, Make your memo look more professional by using bullet points or lists and ensuring that you align justify for all paragraphs. Furthermore, you should use the same font size in your message as you have used in the previous fields, with the exception of the title. Start each topic with the proper headings. This will make the memo look more professional and will also leave a better impression on the reader, not to mention making the memo read more clearly. If necessary, you can even customize the memo to use a table. This is sometimes a good idea, especially if using a bullet list or something similar makes the memo look too crowded and difficult to read.

, Make sure that you do not overlook the information that is provided in the footer. This is where you should put your company information or your personal contact information. It is vitally important that you take the time to ensure that this information is correct. The last thing you want to have happen is to write an excellent memo and then have incorrect contact information or have that information missing altogether.

, One of the most appealing things about the template is that you can even change the color of the document. This allows you to exercise a certain degree of personality and makes the entire document stand out more precisely. It also allows you to choose a color that is appropriate for the situation at hand in order to ensure that the memo is visually striking, yet professional.

, Save the template so that you can use it again and again in the future when your memo is ready. This will always give you something to fall back on and also provides proof of all documentation that you have written in the memo. Whenever you need to use it for a slightly different subject in the future, simply do the same thing as you did this time and change each field to suit the particular situation that you need to send out a new memo for. This will save you time and will also help you create a memo that is professional and that will get the attention of people so the memo will be read in a prompt manner.

Start with a meaningful question.,
Think about your audience.,
Brainstorm your ideas.,
Research.,
Write an outline.",How to Write a Manifesto1," This a way to help you form inspiring ideas. These meaningful questions can give you focus. You may wish to ask more than one, or to focus on topics surrounding a particular question. Some examples of meaningful questions include:


What do you want your legacy (as an individual, group or organization) to be?
What gives your life purpose and meaning?
What types of actions are aligned with your values?
How do you want to show up in the world?
What do you want to accomplish in your life?
What are you willing to do to achieve those accomplishments?;
, To whom are you writing the manifesto? Will your work be read by your colleagues, the general public, or clients? This may change how you choose to use language. A theological manifesto might have a lot of academic terminology if your audience is academics, but it might use very plain speech if it is directed at a wider audience.

, When you're first starting out, don't feel like you have to know exactly what you're going to say. Just write down your ideas in little brainstorming sessions. There are lots of ways to go about brainstorming. Choose one which suits you best, and which enables you to most freely jot down your ideas. The key is not to criticize, but to open yourself up to ideas.


Thought webs can help you to connect many different ideas. Make sure you are adding as many connected details as you can. This will also help you to build an outline.
Lists are a great way to get a lot of ideas down quickly. Make a list for each section of your manifesto, and to title them appropriately.
Stream of consciousness writing can help you to get your brain working on the topic. By writing whatever comes to mind, and not worrying about the punctuation and grammar conventions, you can feel free to express important concepts. Give yourself a time limit, and see how much you can jot down in that time.

, By researching your topic, you will strengthen your ideas. Provide yourself with sources to back up your argument. Also, survey other manifestos to see if anyone has written something similar which can provide you with models.


Read other manifestos on a similar topic for useful tools and arguments. Famous manifestos include: The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx, ""I Have a Dream"" by Martin Luther King, or John F Kennedy's ""Man on the Moon"".
Strengthen your arguments by reading the opponents of your views online. Take a class if you have the time and the money.
Familiarize yourself with theory surrounding your topic. Go to your local library or bookstore and ask a librarian or clerk to help you find similar writers.

, Once you have enough ideas that you see a unifying point, make an outline. This will help you to arrange your ideas once you write. Put them into a logical order. Make sure to include an introduction and a conclusion in your outline. You don't need to write full sentences here. This is a point where you're just trying to figure out the flow of your writing.


Use Roman numerals to number the major sections.
Use uppercase letters to list details about the major sections.
Use Arabic numerals (1,2,3) to give specifics or examples about the details of your major sections.

Gather the best materials.,
Find a good writing table.,
Develop good writing posture.Once you’ve found a table that will discourage you from slumping or hitching your shoulders up, you need to hold your body in a way that prevents the back, neck, and shoulder pain that can accompany improper posture.,
Position the page at an angle between 30 and 45 degrees.Sit flush with the edge of the desk, then turn the page you’re writing on until it sits at an angle somewhere between 30 and 45 degrees to your body.,
Stretch your hands before writing.The rise of computers and cell phones for written communication has had a significant negative impact on handwriting — one study revealed that 33% of people have trouble reading their own writing.Another symptom of this decline is the infrequency with which people write by hand these days; if you don’t stretch your hands to prepare them for a sudden increase in activity, you’ll find yourself cramping up sooner than you’d like.",How to Write Neatly1," All you need is a piece of paper and either a pen or a pencil — it seems simple enough, right? However, poor quality materials can make a significant impact on the legibility of your writing.


The page should be smooth — not rough enough to catch the tip of your pen and create snags in the line of your letters, and not so smooth that the tip of your pen goes sliding about without your control.
Use lined paper sized appropriately for your comfort level — wide-ruled if you write large letters, college-ruled if you write small letters.
Note that in many professional contexts, adults are expected to write within the limits of college-ruled paper, but feel free to use wide-ruled if you are still young and in school.
Experiment with different types of pens to see which one works best for you. There are several styles, each with their own benefits and drawbacks.Fountain pens use liquid ink and have a flexible writing tip that allows for stylized handwriting. While it delivers a beautiful line, a good fountain pen can be pricey, and it takes a good deal of practice to perfect fountain pen technique.
Ballpoint pens use a paste ink which some find unappealing compared to liquid ink; however, they can be extremely inexpensive. Note that you’ll get what you pay for with ballpoint pens — a cheap pen will deliver poor handwriting, so it may be worth it to spend a little extra money.
Rollerball pens have a “ball” delivery system much like a ballpoint pen, but many people prefer them because they use the higher quality liquid rather than paste ink. However, they don’t last as long as ballpoint pens do.
The gel ink used in gel ink pens is thicker than liquid ink and results in a smooth feel and line that many people enjoy. Gel ink pens come in a wide variety of colors but can dry out quickly.
Fiber tip pens use a felt tip to deliver ink, and many writers enjoy their distinctive feel when drawn against a page — smooth, but with a little friction or resistance. Because the ink dries quickly, these pens are a good option for left-handed writers whose hands smudge their words from left to right.;
, The first step to developing good posture while writing is actually to use a good writing surface. If the table is too low, people have a tendency to slump down and round their spines, which can result in chronic pain and injury. If it’s too high, people carry their shoulders higher than is comfortable, resulting in neck and shoulder pain. Sit at a table that allows you to bend your elbows at approximately a 90-degree angle when writing.

,


Sit in your chair with both feet flat on the ground.
Sit up straight, keeping your back and neck as straight as possible. You can take breaks from time to time if the posture is difficult, but over time, the muscles will develop and allow you to maintain good posture for extended periods.
Instead of dipping your head down to look at the page while you’re writing, keep your head as straight as possible while casting your eyes down. This will still result in a slight dip of the head, but it should not be hanging down toward the page.

, If you are left-handed, the top edge of the page should point to your right; if you are right-handed, it should point to your left.


As you practice writing, make small adjustments to find the angle that feels most comfortable to you and allows you to write most legibly.

,


Clench your writing hand into a gentle fist and hold the position for thirty seconds. Then spread your fingers wide and stretch them for thirty seconds. Repeat four to five times.
Bend your fingers down so the tip of each one touches the base of each finger joint where it meets the palm. Hold for 30 seconds, then release. Repeat four to five times.
Place your hand palm-down on the table. Lift and stretch each finger up one at a time, then lower it. Repeat eight to ten times.

Elaborate on your ideas individually.,
Be concise.,
Make sure to have a conclusion.",How to Write a Manifesto2," This might include your personal beliefs, your worldview, and your experiences that directly inform your manifesto. By introducing yourself, your readers will have a better sense of your life course.Make sure that you share life details related to your ideas.
Relate important experiences from work, school, or life that help readers see you as an authority.
Mentioning your degree in art might be useful in an artist's manifesto, just as civil service would be worth mentioning in a political manifesto.

, There should be some unifying point to your manifesto. This is delivered in your introduction. It will be a compelling argument, connecting all your ideas together. Make sure you take time to craft a well-written thesis statement.

, A precept is an actionable ideal, an instruction meant to regulate behavior or thought. Tell your readers a little about what ideals they're going to read about, before they go into it. You don't want to say everything, just a little bit, so that readers can engage with your manifesto's larger picture. Give yourself at least one sentence to mention the main points of your manifesto.


You can use bullet points to list your precepts.
Follow a precept up with a sentence explanation if you need clarity, but save most of your explaining for the body paragraphs. If it isn't merely presenting the precept, don't put it in the introduction.

, Don't just provide your ideas. Offer a direction for change. Manifestos are revolutionary by nature.Though not all revolutions are equal in scale, all share in this desire for change.


Focus on verbs to evoke a sense of action. Avoid verbs like ""am/is/are"", ""have/has"" and other passive constructions. For example: ""Every artist manifests Art itself,"" instead of ""Every artist is Art itself.""
Use concrete details. Avoid words like ""thing"" and ""something"", as these are not specific. For example: ""Something in our political system disturbs me"" becomes ""Negligence in our political system disturbs me.""
Take a current problem and re-imagine it changed through your ideology.

, Even for a short manifesto, you will want to make sure you devote a section to each of your main points. This will make your points more concrete for readers. It will also help to make sure you address any questions your readers might have.


Give each precept its own paragraph.
For longer sections, use a subheading.

, A well written manifesto is crisp and sharp. The focus is clear and there is exactness in the intention. Its meaning and purpose are unmistakable. By keeping your manifesto concise, you avoid getting off-topic.

, This way you can remind your readers about what they've read and the main point of your manifesto. The conclusion will help give readers a sense of closure. Make sure to restate your thesis at some point during your conclusion.

Read it out loud.,
Revise your work.,
Edit your manifesto.,
Ask someone you trust or respect read it.,
Proofread your manifesto.",How to Write a Manifesto3," Especially once you've gone over your work several times, it can sometimes be difficult to see what is on the page. You lose focus. You read sentences half-way or you read too fast and you miss mistakes. When you read your work out loud, you're more likely to catch some of these errors you missed. It can also help you catch awkward sentences, but also will give you a sense of how it feels.

, This means making changes to the big picture. By revising your work, you take your rough draft and turn it into something that is better developed and tailored to its purpose. Don't worry about all the little things in this phase. What you want to do is to make broad-stroke changes.


Rethink structure, such as paragraph order and focal points.
Elaborate where needed.
Cut out anything unnecessary.

, This is different than proofreading. When you edit, you go through your work with a sharp eye, crafting style and coherence. When you edit, you also correct awkwardness in your writing.Check for cohesion and flow by assuring each sentence connects to the sentence which follows.
Make sure your information is accurate.
Use stronger language.
Seek ways to build sentences that are more clear and exact.

, It can often be very helpful to have someone else read your work. This can give you a new perspective on the ways you present your ideas. Talking about your manifesto with someone else can also help you to develop stronger ideas and more specific articulations of your aims.

, Proofreading is very important to help maintain your credibility. This means looking for all the little errors you made while you were writing. These can make your work look sloppy and not credible. Do this once you're sure you won't be making any more big changes. It will be the last stage of your editing process.Look for incorrect words.
Find punctuation mistakes.
Fix all the little errors.

,How to Write a Manifesto4,
"
Hold your pen/pencil properly.Many people grip the pen too hard in an effort to gain control over their strokes, but that often results in sore hands which lead to sloppy writing.,
Engage your whole arm when writing.,
Practice with simple lines and circles.,
Move on to writing individual letters.Once you’ve gotten comfortable using the proper posture, hand grip, and writing motion with your lines and circles, you should turn your attention to actual letters.,
Practice writing out entire paragraphs.,
Take it slow.,
Write by hand whenever possible.",How to Write Neatly2," The pen should lie lightly in your hand.


Place your index finger on the top of the pen, about one inch away from the writing point.
Place your thumb on the side of the pen.
Support the bottom of the pen against the side of your middle finger.
Let your ring and pinky fingers hang comfortably and naturally.

, Much bad handwriting results from a person’s inclination to “draw” their letters using their fingers alone. Proper writing technique engages muscles all the way from the fingers up to the shoulder and results in a smooth movement of the pen across the page rather than the start-and-stop motion often found with “drawing” writers. Your fingers should act more as guides than as the force behind your writing. Focus on the following:Don’t write using your fingers alone; you should engage the forearm and shoulders as well.
Don’t pick up your hand to move it every few words; you should be using your whole arm to move your hand smoothly across the page as you write.
Keep your wrist as stable as possible. Your forearms should move, your fingers should guide the pen into different shapes, but your wrist should not flex very much.

, Using the proper hand position and writing motion, write a row of lines all the way across a lined sheet of paper. The lines should slant slightly to the right. On the next line of the page, write a row of circles, trying to keep them as even and round as possible. Practice proper technique on your lines and circles for 5-10 minutes every day until you see in your pen control.


Focus on keeping your lines the same length and at the same angle. Circles should have uniform roundness across the board, be the same size, and should close cleanly.
At first, your lines and circles may seem sloppy. Your lines may be of varying lengths, they may not all be drawn at the same angle, etc. Some of your circles may be perfectly round, while others more oblong. Some may close neatly, while others may have an overlapping hang-off where the pen mark ends.
Even though this activity seems simple, don’t be discouraged if your lines and circles are sloppy at first. Keep working at it for short periods of time on a regular basis, and you will see a distinct improvement with practice.
This increased control over lines and curves will help you shape clearer letters.

, But don’t jump ahead to practicing with full sentences just yet — instead, practice writings rows of each letter, just like you did when you were first learning to write as a child.


Write each letter at least 10 times in capital and ten in lower-case across a lined page.
Go through the alphabet at least three times each day.
Work toward uniformity across the board: each individual “a” should look the same as all the other “a”s, and the angle of the letter “t” should be the same as that of the letter “l.”
The bottom of each letter should rest along the line on the page.

, You can copy a paragraph out of a book, write a paragraph of your own, or simply copy a paragraph out of this article. However, you’ll cover all your bases if practice writing with pangrams, or sentences that include every letter of the alphabet.You can have fun trying to come up with your own pangrams, look them up on the internet, or use these examples:


The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.
Jim quickly realized that the beautiful gowns are expensive.
Few quips galvanized the mock jury box.
Pack my red box with five dozen quality jugs.

, Don’t expect your handwriting to miraculous improve overnight — it might take a long time to erase the improper muscle memory developed over years of writing poorly. However, with time and patience, you’ll see a marked improvement in your handwriting.


Don’t rush your words. Although in some contexts — for example, if you’re taking notes for a class or business meeting — you may have to write quickly, whenever possible slow down your writing process and focus on creating uniformity throughout your letters.
Over time, as your hand and arm grow more accustomed to this new writing motion, you can speed up your writing while trying to maintain the same legibility as your slower practice-writing.

, If you’re serious about improving your handwriting, you have to make a commitment to it. Although it may be tempting to simply take notes on a laptop or tablet rather than a pen and paper, your handwriting will begin to slip back into sloppiness if you don’t keep training your writing hand and arm.


Bring the techniques from your practice sessions into the real world: carry a good pen and pad of good paper with you; look for writing surfaces at an appropriate height; maintain good writing posture; hold the pen properly, with the page at a comfortable angle; and let your fingers guide the pen while your arms do the work of moving it across the page.

"
"
Use the same quality materials and posture as you did with print.,
Jog your memory on the cursive alphabet.,
Practice each letter in upper and lowercase.,
Perfect the connections between different letters.,
Write out sentences and paragraphs.,
Move your pen slowly but surely.",How to Write Neatly3," The only difference between writing in print and in cursive is the shape of the letters. Keep all of the advice from the first two sections of this article in mind as you practice cursive: have good quality materials, a writing desk of appropriate height, good posture, and proper hand positioning around the pen.

, You were probably taught how to write all the letters in both lower and uppercase as a child. However, if you, like many adults, have gone many years without practicing your cursive script, you may find that you don’t recall how all of the letters are formed. Though many of the letters are fairly close to their print counterparts, some — the “f” in both lower and upper cases, for example — are not.


Purchase a cursive handwriting book from the “school” aisle at the store, or go to a teaching supply store if you cannot find it there. If neither of those options pans out for you, buy one online.
You can also find the letters easily online for free., Just as you did with print writing, you should practice each cursive letter discretely, like you did as a new student of cursive. Make sure that you are following the correct stroke pattern for each letter.At first, leave each letter isolated. Write a row of ten capital A-s, a row of ten lowercase a-s, a row of capital B-s, etc., making sure that each iteration of the letter stands alone.
But remember that in cursive, letters connect to one another. After you’ve grown comfortable practicing the letters in isolation, repeat the previous step, but connect each letter to the next.
Note that there is no convention in cursive for uppercase letters being connected in a row; therefore, you would write a single uppercase A and connect it to a string of nine lowercase a-s.

, The biggest difference between cursive and print, other than the shape of the letters, is obviously that the letters in a word are all connected by the pen stroke in cursive. As such, it’s important that you be able to connect any two letters together naturally without having to think too hard about what it should look like. To practice this, follow staggered patterns through the alphabet, rotating through day-to-day to both keep you from getting bored and to help you cover all the various connections over time.


Front to back, working to middle: a-z-b-y-c-x-d-w-e-v-f-u-g-t-h-s-i-r-j-q-k-p-l-o-m-n
Back to front, working to middle: z-a-y-b-x-c-w-d-v-e-u-f-t-g-s-h-r-i-q-j-p-k-o-l-n-m
Front to back skipping one letter: a-c-e-g-i-k-m-o-q-s-u-w-y; b-d-f-h-j-l-n-p-r-t-v-x-z
Back to front skipping two letters, and always ending with : z-w-t-q-m-k-h-e-b; y-v-s-p-m-j-g-d-a; x-u-r-o-l-i-f-c
And so on. Create as many different patterns as you’d like — the goal is simply to focus thoughtfully on creating the connections between different letters.
The added benefit of this exercise is that since the letters do not create actual words, you cannot speed through the writing. By forcing yourself to slow down, you will practice writing the letters and connecting them in a deliberate and thoughtful manner.

, Just as you did in the previous section, you should move on to actual words, sentences, and paragraphs once you have grown comfortable with the individual letters. Use the same pangrams you practiced on with your print handwriting.

, With print handwriting, you lift the pen after every letter or couple of letters, depending on your personal style. However, with cursive, you will have to write many letters before you can lift your pen. This can cause problems in terms of fluidity of penmanship.


You may be tempted to rest your hand after every letter or two. Not only does this interrupt the flow of the word, it can also result in ink blots if you are using a fountain or other liquid ink pen.
Write as slowly and deliberately as necessary to make sure you don’t have to rest your pen in the middle of a word. The cursive script should progress through a word at an even, smooth pace.

Write the rest of your essay, referring to your outline as needed.,
Don’t get bogged down in minor details.,
Include any necessary citations.,
Review your introduction.,
Make any desired revisions to your essay.,
Format your essay properly.,
Proofread your essay thoroughly.",How to Write a Paper Faster," Avoid anything that you know tends to distract you from work—social media, television, chatting or texting with friends, etc. To write an essay quickly, you’ll need to focus.


Be persistent if people distract you from your writing. For instance, put a status up on social media that you’re going to be working for a while, but will catch up with people afterwards. If friends text or call, let them know the same thing.;
, If you were given a prompt or guidelines for writing your essay, read them very carefully. You can make a good start on writing an essay quickly if you make sure that you understand what the assignment is asking you to do.This means making sure you understand any instructions you are given about length and format, but also about the kind of essay you are asked to write.For instance:


A research paper will ask you to incorporate outside sources.
A narrative essay will ask you to tell a story about something that happened.
A literary analysis will ask you to quote and analyze a text.

, Sure, you want to write an essay quickly, so it seems like writing an outline will just make the process take longer. However, having an outline helps you focus and write more quickly, by giving you a “map” to follow once you begin writing. This sense of direction will keep you from rambling in your essay.Choose whatever style of outline you prefer (bullet points, a diagram, brief sentences, etc.). At the very least, jot down the main points you think your essay will make., You’ll need the tools to actually write your essay (computer, paper and pen, etc.), but also any other sources required to write your essay. If you are writing a literary analysis, for instance, you’ll need a copy of the text you are writing about. If you’re writing a research paper, you’ll need the articles, books, or other sources that you will cite.


You might also be able to find sources as you write, but make sure to keep a detailed list of them so that you can cite them correctly in your essay.

, Start at the beginning of your essay, with its introduction. Don’t agonize about how to begin, or about making an especially creative introduction. Just focus on writing one that is clear, and get it out of the way.Typically, an introduction can be just a few sentences long. Touch on the topic of your essay, and what you will be covering in it. Use your outline as a reminder of this, and as a guide to write something in your introduction like: “In this essay, I will describe X, then Y, and then Z.”
The introduction can be the most important part of an essay, because it explains your idea and outlines your essay for your readers.Get something down in a first draft, and you can come back and tweak it if you have time after writing the rest of the essay.
If you are really stuck on your introduction and don't know how to begin, you can start with the body of your essay instead, and come back and write the introduction later. Just make sure you have a clear idea of what to write your essay on, and that you leave enough time to write the introduction at the end.

, Now that you have your introduction drafted, you’ll need to move on to the rest of your essay. Write quickly and stay focused. If you refer to your outline frequently as you write, you’ll remember the next part you need to work on. This will keep your essay from rambling, and shorten the amount of time it takes to write it.

, Your writing will need to be clear and precise if it is to be successful, but you don’t have to agonize over every word choice. If you find yourself staring at a sentence, unable to find a word that sounds “right” or “better,” just pick something quickly and move on. You don’t want the writing to take too long, and if you have time at the end, you can go back and improve minor details like this.Focus on getting the main points down, simply and clearly. This will keep you motivating and moving.

, If you did not cite your sources (if you have any) in your essay as you wrote it, then after finishing a draft, go back through and include them. In addition, make a works cited page or bibliography if your assignment instructions ask you to.


Cite your sources according to the style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) that your instructor wants you to use.
Citing your sources is really important. If you don’t do it properly, it can be considered plagiarism. As a rule of thumb, if you got an idea or information from a source outside of your own head, you should cite it., If you have enough time, go back and reread your introduction. Make any improvements that you can. Since the introduction is such an important part of your essay—and the first thing your instructor will read—you’ll want to make a good impression.


Make sure that your introduction reflects your essay’s content, is clear, and avoids sweeping generalizations like “Since the dawn of mankind people have….”, While still writing quickly, you can review your first draft and make any revisions to it that you think will make your writing better.An effective and fast way to do this is to make a reverse outline..To make a reverse outline, write down the main ideas of your essay as they are presented paragraph by paragraph. The result will look much like an outline you would create before writing an essay, but you can use it to double-check your finished product.
A reverse outline helps to spot things like paragraphs that can be moved to make the flow of your ideas clearer, and places where you might need to cite sources. These are revisions you can take care of quickly, and improve your essay.

, If you weren’t sticking to formatting requirements as you were writing, go back and check your instructions for directions regarding these. Make any changes you need to in your essay, keeping an eye out for things you might be asked to format, like:


Line spacing (single, double, etc.)
Font and font size
Margin size
Name, date, and essay title

, After you’ve made any formatting and/or organizational changes to your essay, do a quick review of your essay to correct spelling and grammatical errors, and any other minor issues.If you are proofreading from a hard copy of your essay, use a pen or pencil to make notes on the paper of the changes you need to make. Correct the mistakes immediately and congratulate yourself on a speedy essay.


Don’t rely solely on electronic spelling and grammar checkers if you can. They’re better than nothing, but they’re far from perfect. If you can spare a few minutes to do a proofread, it can pay off.
A quick and thorough way to proofread is to read your work aloud. This tends to be the fastest way to catch any mistakes.If you can ask a friend to proofread your paper, that can be even more effective, because he or she will have fresh eyes and can catch mistakes you might overlook.

You'll need to analyze it for your handwriting tendencies. This will help you focus on improving and embellishing the words. You particularly want to see if you write with a loose, relaxed and easy hand rather than a cramped, tight hand.Determine what letters you naturally embellish. Which have curls and flourishes?
Look at your spacing. Is it all over the place or are your letters more evenly distributed on the page?
Look at the pen or pencil strokes you use. You'll want a mix of thin and thick strokes in your letters.;
, Writing with a looser more relaxed script will be determined by which muscles you use when you're writing. You don't want to write only with your hand or your fingertips. Beautiful writing comes when you use your whole arm and shoulder as you write.To determine this, write a paragraph as you normally would. Pay attention to which muscles you're using. This will tell you if you're writing too much with only your hand rather than your whole arm in a loose, relaxed manner.
Your fingers are there to be the guides on the page, but they shouldn't be doing all the work, otherwise your writing will be cramped and tight.
Your arm and shoulder should be moving, but not your wrist and fingers.

, You'll need to find the right writing utensil, and paper for your writing. Every person is different, although there are some general ideas about what is easier to write more beautifully with. For instance, a pen is typically better than a pencil because a pen will usually give you smoother lines.Nicer paper (usually more expensive) rather than computer paper will make your handwriting better, because you won't have to deal with smudges and tears and bleeding ink. You can find some at a stationary shop.
Moleskin journals can be very good for practicing beautiful writing in, because the paper helps your handwriting become smoother.
People often use fountain pens rather than a cheap plastic ballpoint, because nicer pens have a better ink flow, but you could also use something like a calligraphy marker or Sanford elegant writer, which make nice variations in length and width of your letters because of the flat tip. They also tend to have bold colors.

, Fast handwriting is choppy, small, and has a great amount of applied pressure. Write slowly and gracefully with slow, light marks. You will have smoother pen-strokes and more consistent lines and curves. Make sure you are never straining your hand when writing or else you are pressing down too hard.


Write as if your hand is moving through water.

, As with anything important, you will have to practice your beautiful writing before you will be confident in it. Write as often as you can, paying attention to how you're writing and what muscles you're using.


Practice writing on lined paper to learn spacing. Spacing between letters and between words (you want it to be pretty uniform) is incredibly important for creating beautiful handwriting.
Doodle constantly. Doodle on the margins of notebooks, while you're waiting for the bus, while you're on the phone. It will help you relax and get accustomed to your more beautiful writing.

, Grab one of those old cursive practice books that you had to use in elementary school and start practicing each letter in the alphabet. Just remember that everyone's writing is distinctive, so your handwriting will be cursive (and attractive) it will be unique to you.You want to make sure that your letters are evenly spaced, so practice on lined paper so you can see the spacing.
There are lots of free cursive worksheets and workbooks, either on the internet or in your local library.

, The best way to write cursive is to put the writing utensil between your forefinger and your middle finger, with fingertips and thumb place near the pen or pencil's tip.


This position helps to alleviate the pain in forearm, wrist, and thumb.

, Cursive is basically all about the connections between letters. It is supposed to be used as a rapid method of writing. As such it comes from the Latin word ""currere"" which means ""to run"" and so cursive translates as ""a running hand."" Keep that in mind when you're forming the connections.The connections are simply the ""air"" between the letters when you would normally lift your writing utensil.
Make sure to close gaps on the tops of words. If they aren't closed it will be difficult to tell if a lowercase letter is an ""a"" or a ""u.""

, This means that your feet are firmly on the floor, you are comfortable and your back is straight. It also means that you need to have the right pen hold.The pen should sit between your first two knuckles, gripped by your thumb and first finger. It should rest against the middle finger.
For the proper position of the pen you need to make sure that you're holding it at a 45 degree angle. To test this, draw a right angle (90 degrees) with a pencil. From the corner of the angle slide your pen upward cutting the right angle in half. It should be a thin stroke.

, You will want to make sure that you give the appearance of a weighted line, meaning that your strokes appear thick and thin, as needed. To do this you'll need to pick the pens and paper and ink that work best for you.


Broad edge writing tools that work well for calligraphy are markers, fountain pens, staff with inserted nibs (tips), brushes, quills, or reeds.
You will want paper that doesn't bleed ink through. You can practice on regular notebook paper. Check the cotton content of paper, because papers with a cotton content to give a crisper line. Of course you can always find paper specially for calligraphy and if you have a calligraphy set it often comes with appropriate paper.
In terms of inks, you want to stay away from india drawing inks, because the lacquer in them has a tendency to rust the nibs of pens and to clog pens. It's better to find a water soluble ink.

, This means understanding where the lines go so that your calligraphy has uniformity of appearance. You'll need to set a nib height, which can be anything, but the 15th century italic has a height of 5 nibs, which will be used in the example of proper lines.


Baseline is the writing line that all letters sit on.
Waistline is the line above the baseline, which changes according to the x-height of the letter (in this case, 5 nibs above baseline).
Ascending line is the line that all ascending letters hit. It should be 5 nibs above the waistline (or whichever nib length you're using). Ascending letters are the letter like a lowercase ""h"" or ""l.""
Descending line is the line that descending letters hit. It should be 5 nibs below the baseline. Descending letters are the ones like a lowercase ""g,"" or ""f.""

, You will, of course, need to practice the letters of your chosen calligraphy style, so that you become accustomed to them, but you'll also need to practice the angle of your writing utensil and the movement of your hand.


Play around with your pen and ink. Make circles, tents, and lines as practice so you get the feel for the angle and the press of the pen.

, You can have beautiful handwriting that is based on one of the styles above, like calligraphy or cursive, but you can spice it up by using ideas from other creative sources.Look at the works of artists, graphic designers, calligraphers and see how they use their words to create a distinctive style.
Pay attention to things like billboards, signs, menus, posters for the styles of writing that they use.
Look at patterns (like quilt patterns, drawing patterns) for inspiration on how to make your writing more interesting. You can even look at the shapes and lines of trees.

, For instance, look at the illuminated medieval manuscripts and the first Initials of writings which were often inhabited by figures, animals and historical scenes.


There are lots of ancient scripts that could be interesting and creative to incorporate into your own writing style. Check out Ancient Egyptian hieratic or hieroglyphic scripts or Norse runes.

, Of course you can always write beautiful cards to be your friends and family, for holidays and birthdays and thank yous, but you can also use your handwriting in other projects.


You could make a hand lettered ornament, by using a permanent type pen on a plain round ornament with words you have chosen.
You could make a poster with the words of a poem or quote you like.

Don't get upset if they don't pursue cursive.",How to Teach a Child to Write in Cursive," Once your child is in about third or fourth grade, or expresses a wish to learn cursive, get them started on learning. It's best to have a sheet that shows every letter in cursive, in uppercase and lowercase, and start them on reading it, as cursive can be very difficult to read initially.


You can start your child on writing cursive, if you wish, but if they begin reading it first, you will be able to show them an example of what cursive typically looks like, how it's connected, and what letters are what.;
, When your child is able to read cursive writing, have them begin to practice writing it. Start off with things such as cursive practice sheets that show how to write the letters, and make sure they're doing both uppercase and lowercase letters.


It's best to get them to try writing all of the letters, and then seeing which letters were difficult for them. Ask your child which letters were the hardest for them to write, and then help them practice.
Be aware that your child may find another way of writing a letter, such as writing their lowercase F so the lower loop is to the left of the line. Don't chide them on this - as long as you can still tell what the letter is, it doesn't need to be corrected.

, When writing sentences, your child will be learning how to connect the letters. Teach your child how to connect letters, and which letters don't get connected to other letters.


A good sentence, when your child is comfortable with cursive, would be ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"". It contains all letters of the alphabet, making it possible for your child to try connecting all letters.
You can also start them on simple sentences, such as introducing themselves in cursive.
Keep in mind that they should get a chance to use both capital and lowercase letters so that they learn to connect all letters, or which letters generally don't get connected.

, If your child is having trouble learning cursive, write it yourself so that they can see how you do it. Who knows - maybe you're out of practice, too!

, If your child doesn't want to learn cursive, don't force them into it. You can tell them that it's a useful skill, but if they don't want to learn cursive, don't get upset with them and don't make them learn it anyway.


Your child may learn cursive but feel that writing in print is more efficient. That's okay. Many children write in print now, and it's common for some students to write partly in cursive and partly in print, or write in a cursive-print hybrid.
Keep in mind that your child may just not want to learn cursive now. If they tell you they don't want to learn cursive, they may just not want to learn it in this time of their life for whatever reason - many children can be stubborn about learning. Keep the option open for them and let them come to you if they want to learn it.

Practice is everything.,
Have patience.,
Be a Good reader.,
Grammar also counts.,
Essential favors you should take care before writing.,
Save your writing and re-read it from time to time.",How to Make Your Writing Look Natural," The single best way for you to improve your writing is to, well, keep writing. Practice may not necessarily make perfect, but it can help to develop those skills and improve them. Keep writing, daily if possible. It is only through continued practice that you will improve.


Be determined and develop a regular schedule that you can live with. Along with studying, set out some time for writing.;
, Patience also plays a major role in improving your writing because practicing your writing it requires a large amount of time, concentration, and control. Don't give up if you don't improve at all because making your writing look cool and natural may take some time.

, This may sound backwards, but to be a good writer, you need to be a good reader. Try to read something everyday. Expand your knowledge by reading different types of writing. If you are primarily a fiction reader, start reading the newspaper or non-fiction books. Read articles online versus magazine articles and see if you notice the differences in writing styles. If you happen to read something that you really enjoy, study the article or story. Use the tips you find to improve your own writing. On the other hand, when you read something you don’t care for, make mental notes of the mistakes the writer made and try to avoid them when you sit down to write.

, Like it or not, your grammar skills play a big part in your writing. You may not want to think about nouns, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions or prepositions, but if you want to be a good writer you need to know what they are and how to use them correctly. Using the proper punctuation will ensure that people are reading your sentences correctly. For instance, if you intended a sentence to end, but didn’t end it with a period, your readers wouldn’t be able to make sense out of your writing. Don’t forget to use the spell-check function that came with the word processing software on your computer.

, If you are determined to improve your writing skills,read on.


First of all, find a pen you like to write with. Finding the right pen might take a while, but it's definitely the most important step. But, remember that a costlier pen doesn't necessarily mean it's better for you.
The second most important thing is, of course, a good notebook. Choose the ruling which you are most comfortable with - be it wide, college or narrow.
Find a good spot for writing. The place you choose should not be distracting.
Now, find a sample of some handwriting you like and want to imitate. This will give you a goal. However, this is not mandatory.
Now get to writing. Slow down your writing considerably. Always remember that legibility is more important than aesthetic beauty.
Observe your writing very closely. Are there particular letters you write in unique ways that are not legible? If so, practice more standard formations for the whole alphabet. Concentrate on overall letter formation, the slant of each letter and the beginning and ending of your strokes.
Move on to complete words once you've made it all the way through the problematic alphabets. Pay attention to character spacing, the way your letters flow from one into the next, and also the spacing between words.
Try to make writing a habit. Write letters instead of e-mails whenever possible. Keeping a diary is extremely useful.
Try writing with your non-dominant hand. This will slow you down, help you think about the writing.
Develop a test sentence for yourself and write it every week. This will help you gauge your progress at the end of the month.

, You will see the improvements you have made. As your skills and your confidence grow, you will find that writing not only comes easier to you, it becomes something you enjoy doing!

Look at the size of the letters.,
Examine the gaps between words and letters.,
Check out the margins of the page.,
Study printed letters.,
Observe cursive letters.,
Scrutinize the shape of letters.,
Inspect the signature.,
Look at the slanting on the words and letters.,
Determine how much pressure they used to write.,
Look for sections of handwriting that stand out from the rest.",How to Tell What Someone is Like from Their Handwriting," This is the first, and most basic, observation you can make about someone’s handwriting. To determine what size the handwriting would be classified, visualize the paper you might have learned to write on as children. It is lined paper, with faint mid-lines down the center of each line. Small letters would fall below the midline, average letters hit the midline, and large letters take up the entire line. Large letters are a sign that someone is pretty outgoing, sociable, and may like being the center of attention. However, it can also indicate false confidence and a desire to be something they're not.
Small letters can mean someone is more shy and timid. Small letters can also indicate meticulousness and intense focus.
Average size letters mean the person is well-adjusted and adaptable. They occupy a nice middle ground between two extremes.;
, Words that are scrunched together tightly indicate that the person dislikes being alone. They probably choose to be around people as much as possible, and may have issues respecting “the bubble” of personal space. If they use wide spaces between words and letters, they enjoy independence and open spaces. They don’t like to be overwhelmed, and they value their freedom., Did they write all over, or did they leave spaces around the edges? If they left a larger margin on the left side of the page, they may be someone who dwells in the past a bit. On the other hand, those who leave spaces on the right hand margin may worry too much about the future, and get anxiety thinking about what’s ahead. A person who writes all over the page is probably a bit spastic, with a racing mind., There are several letters in the alphabet that can be written different ways, and everyone develops their own style and preference. Someone's method of writing certain letters can be great clues into their personality.A narrow loop in the lowercase “e” can indicate skepticism or suspicion towards others. This person may be guarded and stoic. A wide loop can show that the person is more open to new people and experiences.
A person who dots their lowercase “i” very high may be more creative and free-spirited than a person who dots the “i” right on top. Those people tend to be more structured and detail-oriented. If the dot on the “i” is an open circle, the person may be more spirited and childlike.
When it comes to the capital I, look how the writer uses it. When they are referring to themselves by saying “I,” is the letter bigger than the rest of the words? Someone who uses a large “I” may be cocky and a little overly confident. If the capital “I” is the same size or smaller than the rest of the words, they are content with who they are.
Crossing a “t” with a long line indicates enthusiasm and determination. A short cross can be a sign of apathy and a lack of determination. Crossing a “t” very high up can mimic having high goals and high esteem, while crossing the “t” low can indicate the opposite.
If their “o” is left open, the writer may be more of an open book. They tend to be expressive and willing to share secrets. A closed “o” can mean that someone treasures privacy and may tend toward introversion.

, Of course, not every writing sample you obtain will contain both printed and cursive letters, but you will get the most information if you can examine both. Cursive writing provides new clues that you cannot get from printed writing.Look at the lowercase “l.” A narrow loop in the “l” can be a sign of tension, caused by limiting or restricting yourself, while a wide loop may mean you’re more unstructured, easy going, and relaxed.
Check out the lowercase “s.” A rounded “s” may mean the writer likes to keep the people around them happy, preferring to stay out of confrontations. A pointier “s” is a sign that someone is curious, hardworking, and ambitious. Finally, if the “s” widens out at the bottom, the writer may not be pursuing the job or relationships that they genuinely desire.
The length and width of the lowercase “y” can tell you something. A skinny “y” can indicate that the writer is picky when choosing friends, while a broad “y” probably means they approach friendship with a “more the merrier” approach. A long “y” suggests a person loves to explore and travel, while a short “y” may suggest the person would prefer to stay at home.

, A writer that uses loopy, rounded letters tends to be more imaginative, creative, and artistic. Pointed letters can indicate intensity, aggression, and intelligence. If the letters all connect together, the writer may be more orderly and methodical., An illegible signature can be a sign that the writer is reserved and private. A legible signature indicates that they are more self-assured and content with themselves.


A quickly scrawled signature may also mean that the signer is impatient and appreciates efficiency. A careful signature can show that the signer is precise and independent.

, The words may slant to the right or the left, or they may be perfectly upright. If they slant to the right, the writer is probably more on the easygoing side, always looking to try new things and meet new people. Writers whose words slant to the left may keep to themselves a bit more, enjoying their solitude and anonymity. If a person’s writing is straight up-and-down, they are probably rational and level-headed.There is one catch to this. If the writer is left-handed, the analysis of the right and left slanting should be switched. In other words, if a left-handed person slants their words to the right, they may be more shy, while if they slant their words to the left, they may be more outgoing and sociable., You can figure this out by the darkness and intensity of the ink on the page, or perhaps by flipping the paper over and seeing if there are indentations from the pen. People who write with heavy pressure usually take things pretty seriously, but they may also be rigid and volatile.People who write very lightly are generally sensitive and compassionate, although they may also lack energy and liveliness., This could be a tiny, cramped writing that looks out-of-place in a document filled with large, spacey handwriting. Maybe there is a segment of writing that looks rushed, while the rest looks meticulously written. Pay close attention to this. Writing that looks different from the rest can indicate uncertainty, or even a lie."

Be very sure to keep all of the lettering in proportion.

,
Be sure to keep the space between the letters consistent.,
Have a consistent space between lines.",How to Space Calligraphy Letters," Your general spacing will depend upon the style of writing, the amount of text written and the width of the nib you are using.;
, Depending on what you are trying to say or show, space it out, or crunch it up.

,, Try using a spacer between each letter so that it doesn't vary.


One rule of thumb is to use the size of the letter ""o"" between the letters for consistency.

Look at the letters that make up your name, and think about how you can best emphasize them: note the interesting letters (with a lot of loops, dots, and crosses, like G, X, or B) and the plain letters (especially those that look similar between uppercase and lowercase, like S or O). Look for any areas that could become focal points of your signature.;
, A simple and clear signature will be easier for people to read, but a more complex signature might show more flair. The more flourish you put into your signature, the more flamboyant you may seem. Consider how your signature might speak to the luxury of time. Busy doctors often scrawl hasty, illegible signatures, whereas famous writers often take the time to orchestrate intricate designs.Signatures that include just your initials (with or without the middle initial) are usually considered more formal and businesslike than full-name signatures.
If you’re worried about forgery, consider making your signature longer and more legible. Include your entire first and last name. Be sure to write clearly. It is easier to forge scribbled signatures than it is to copy the nuances of a practiced, legible signature.

, Some people sign their full name, and some sign only their first or last name. Some just use their initials. If you are known only by your first or last name—like Beyonce or Ronaldo— then you might consider using just the first name. If you are a professor who typically goes by their last name, you may just sign your surname.

, Look at the signatures of famous people, and consider whether you want to emulate anybody. Kurt Vonnegut, Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, Picasso, and John Hancock (among many others) are all known for their unique signature styles. Don't be afraid to borrow eye-catching elements and add them to your own signature., Rewrite your signature over and over to explore the possibilities. Have fun with it. Play with a variety of styles and flourishes. See what feels comfortable to write, looks good with your name, and isn’t too hard to copy repeatedly. Use a writing tool that feels right in your hand. Consider using pencil if you want to erase and rework your signature.

, Make a letter larger so that it stands out, or make it very small so that it blends in. This can give your signature a bold look without slowing your signing time down to a crawl. Try exaggerating the first letter of your name, or the first letters of your first and last name.If your signature is messy or curly, you can emphasize one letter by making it sharp and clear. Likewise, make a single letter sloppy or fancy if you want it to stand out from an otherwise clean-cut signature.

, This is a classic way to make your name look more ornate. Underlining can also take more time to write out than a simpler style – so consider whether it's worth it.


Turn one of your letters into an underline. This is commonly done with the last letter, but feel free to add a flourish to any letter that lends itself to the style. Letters with a long tail (y, g, j) are perfect. Drag the tail out beneath the signature.
Underline your signature with loops. This is a very fluid, ornate way to spice up a signature.Underline your signature with zig-zags. These are similar to loops, but spikier and more angular.

, Double up on your horizontal crosses, and end your looped letters in hooks and flourishes. Use a fountain pen, if possible. Draw inspiration from calligraphy, from old signatures, and from Gothic lettering. This adds flair to even a simple signature.

, This can be a great way to make your style more unique. Look for letters that lend themselves to an exciting twist, and experiment with ways to make them look fancier. Try the following ideas:


Use repeating elements. The three large ovals in this signature create an echo effect and help tie the whole design together.
Allow your capital letters to encircle the lowercase letters. This is a useful way to spice up a name that doesn’t have any lower loops (g, j, etc.) to play with.
Encircle the signature with loops. This creates a very regal, official-looking signature.
Enlarge the bottoms of your letters. This is one of the simplest and most common ways to spruce up a signature.

, The symbols might include a team jersey number, a simple sketch, or a graduation year. If you associate a specific number or symbol with your identity (for instance, if you are well-known for your role on a sports team), this may be a good way to publicly distinguish yourself from people with similar names. If you want to go this route, it’s best to keep the rest of your signature straightforward to save time. Too many symbols can overwhelm the design and make for a long signing process.

, Find pieces of signatures that you like. Consider what works, what doesn't, and what suits your personality. As you practice your signature, tweak small details and flourishes until you've come up with something that feels right.

, Don't pick a signature only because it looks cool. Choose a signature that is stylistic, but also practical.


Your signature should be easy to write and reproduce. It should feel good coming off of your hand, and it should be simple enough that you can dash it off in a matter of seconds.
Your signature should suit your purpose and personality. If you want to show your dramatic side, use a signature with flair. If you want to tell people that you are neat and ordered, your signature should reflect that.
Your signature should be identifiable. It shouldn't just look like a scribble on the page – unless it's a recognizable scribble, and it comes out like that every time. Make your signature unique so that people know it's yours.

, Remember that you can always change it, up to a point. If you use a certain signature on all of your legal documents (driver's license, passport, credit card, bank records) then it may be inconvenient to change it. In some cases, your signature actually serves to identify you, and you may arouse suspicion if you sign in a way that doesn't match the records.

, The coolest, most complicated signature in the world is useless if you can't quickly sign it onto new documents. As you practice your signature, think about practicality: consider how fast you can sign it, whether you need any special writing tools, and whether you can make it look the same each time. If you can't easily reproduce your signature, you might want to simplify your design.


Bear in mind that this does not apply to digital signatures. Most digital document-signing applications will save your personalized signature for later use. Sign it right once, and you can copy it to any future document. However. it may be wise to keep your digital signature consistent with your analog signature."

Use a separate signature from your official one.,

Practice your official signature and your autograph back to back.,
Arrange instances for signing.,
Treat your fans with dignity and social grace.,
Equip yourself to autograph.",How to Sign Autographs," Once you sign an autograph, you have no idea where it might end up! It might be sold at an auction or on an auction site, like eBay, it might be awarded as a prize or reward to someone in your fan club -- in the worst case scenario, it might even fall into the hands of someone disreputable.


You should have two separate signatures, one for autograph signing and one for signing official documents. This will cut down the chances on your signature being forged.
Now that you're famous, your name, signature, and reputation are in the spotlight. This means you'll have to be even more careful protecting yourself from identity theft and fraud.;
, There are many different kinds of signature you might use, and each of these will signify something different to your fans. An elegant signature penned in flowing cursive may give your fans the impression of breeding, culture, and manners. A quick scrawl might make it appear as though you're hurried, driven, and certain of yourself.


You may have to experiment with various kinds of signatures before you find one that best suits you. See how loops, flourishes, tall letters, short letters, narrow and wide scripts look with your signature.
You may want to include a symbol that is significant to you in your signature. For example, if you associate yourself with an eagle or lion, or if you have a family crest that uses these symbols, you might weave a simplified version of this image into your signature., You may find that other famous people in your industry use similar signatures. You may want to imitate this style and add your own flourish, or you might want to ignore the conventions of your peers completely and make something uniquely your own!


When viewing the signatures of others in your profession, you might want to ask yourself why a certain style is being used. A basketball player, for example, may have a very simplified style to make it easier when signing basketballs.

, To further differentiate your official signature with your autograph, you may want to abbreviate your name or use an initial. An abbreviated name can be a huge benefit if you think you might be signing a lot of autographs; shortening your first and middle name to initial letters will cut down on the writing you do considerably.


You may not want to limit your first name to its first initial, but you may want to use a more casual form. For example, you might use a nickname, like ""Tony"" in place of ""Anthony"" or ""Ly"" instead of ""Lyla."", A paraph is a special mark or flourish that you add to your signature to make it unique.Some examples of this include using the tail of a letter to cross a ""t"" or two crossing lines at the beginning or ending of your signature. A paraph can make your signature harder to duplicate, and can also give it more character, setting it apart from others.


You might add a thick, half moon stroke to a section under you signature that you wish to make more prominent. The first president of America, George Washington, did so under the middle part of his last name.
You could separate the last letter of your name from the rest of your signature, and either simplify the letter or add a flourish. An example of this can be found in the signatures of American president John F. Kennedy.
Napoleon Bonaparte, while only usually signing his first name, would often use the tail of the last letter to add a bold underline to his signature. You might do the same in yours!
If you want an especially elegant signature, you should experiment with using the tails of the initial and ending letters in the parts of your name to make looping designs below it. Queen Elizabeth I of England would extend first ""E"" in her name, using the bottom strokes to entwine with the tail of the ""z,"" which she also enlarged so the bottom could loop in an intricate paraph., You never know what you'll be asked to sign. Presidents, for example, have signed novels, hats, golf balls, pictures and more!You should have a practiced hand when it comes to signing autographs so you can do so easily and without hesitation when the time comes -- even if you're surprised by a request to autograph something odd.


You might want to spend a few weeks doodling your autograph wherever you can for a few weeks until you are completely comfortable with it. You might even turn your practice into a game with a piece of chalk! Simply write your autograph wherever you go.

, If you're an author, it's likely you'll mostly be signing books. If you're a rock star, you may find that you spend most of your time autographing albums and maybe even fans themselves! It's good to practice your signature on various surfaces, but you'll need the most practice signing the thing you are known for or an item in the industry you are associated with.


Sports players, especially, are often asked to sign the equipment of their sport. Many fans have sought the autograph of boxers on boxing gloves, hockey players on sticks and pads, and basketball player on jerseys and balls., You don't want to confuse your official signature with your autograph! This could result in fan frustration. For example, what if a fan waited patiently for your autograph only to get your official signature? This might result in that person being accused of forgery by other fans who have never seen your official signature!

, You may be accosted by fans as you're leaving the stadium, or if you are a notable personality, you might be stopped on the street for an autograph. However, many famous people dislike being bothered during their free time. Having specific times for autograph signing gives you a polite excuse to decline.


For example, if you are stopped on the street by a fan you can let them down easy by saying, ""I'm sorry, this is my personal time. I don't sign autographs in my free time, but I do have a signing coming up. I'd love to see you there!""
By taking time for your fan base and signing autographs, you'll also be doing good PR for yourself. The connection your fans feel after getting your signature and meeting you face to face can do wonders for your reputation, popularity, and sales., It's easy to get overwhelmed by overexcited fans, or to get frustrated by repeated interruptions during your personal time.However, many fans have difficulty thinking of their idol as a person outside of the idol's celebrity identity.It's up to you to be polite and gracious even when your fandom is thoughtlessness.


By acting with politeness and grace, you'll earn even more points with your fandom! This can translate to greater popularity, and can win you respect from fans and non-fans alike.

, In some cases, a fan might request an autograph but have forgotten to bring along an item for you to sign or a pen for you to sign with! The can result in disappointment that is easily preventable on your part. Carry a ballpoint pen and a felt tipped market with you whenever you are out and about.


This way you'll be able to easily sign most items brought to you for signing. In the event a fan has forgotten to bring something to sign, you can use your felt tipped marker to sign an article of clothing."

Choose a pen that is comfortable.,
Grasp the pen loosely.,

Repeat 5-100 times.

",How to Prevent Hand Pain from Excessive Writing," In general, look for a wider barrel (larger diameter) with a padded grip.


Make sure the pen writes smoothly, without skipping or dragging along the page.
Avoid buying pens that rattle or leave behind blotches of ink.

, Do not clench your fingers around the pen or grip it too tightly. You don't need to strangle it, just pull it against the page.

, Get a good pen so you don't have to press hard, then pull the pen lightly and evenly against the paper. If you prefer pencil, try the next softer lead.

, Writing is not drawing! Keep your hand and wrist still, and move your whole arm using the elbow and shoulder (like you are writing on a whiteboard).

, You may not have paid much attention to how to hold a pen since you were in early elementary school, but pay attention now.


Is your hand position neutral? Try to hold your wrist straight and don't turn or bend it as you write.
Are you reaching or straining in any way to reach the page or the desk? Move the desk, chair, and paper until you are comfortable.
Is the rest of your work space comfortable? Are the chair and desk at the right heights for you? Can you see and reach the page without straining or crouching? Are other items you need (such as the stapler or telephone) within easy reach?
Are you relaxed?
Are the rest of your wrist, arm, and elbow supported, at least when you are not actively writing?

, If you lean over your work, your neck, shoulders, and arms will tire that much faster. For longer writing sessions, vary your posture. Lean one way and the other in your chair. Lean back for awhile.

, Leave yourself extra time for writing. Unless this is the big, final test and you have no choice, stand up every hour, or less, and walk around for a minute or two. Relax your hands, arms, and wrists during this time.

, For instance, if you pause for a few moments to compose your next thought, set the pen down, relax your hand, recline in your chair, and even stand up and walk around a bit.

, Grab the pen or pencil and twist it between your fingers. Open and close your hand. Gently stretch your fingers and wrists.

, If you've been at it for several hours, come back later or even the next day.

, If you have a lot to write, try writing in several smaller sessions rather than one long one.

,


Keep your wrist position neutral. Do not bend your wrists in or out, up, or especially down while you type.
Use a keyboard tray to adjust the position of the keyboard.
Make sure your arm position and body positions are neutral.
Do not hammer the keys. Computers, unlike typewriters, work best if you use a light touch, and you'll be far gentler on your hands.

, If a test, writing assignment, or some important thought kept you writing extensively yesterday, use today to get some exercise and get out a bit.

, If most of your writing is for school or work, ask whether accommodations or arrangements can be made. Effective accommodations may be very simple and inexpensive, but you must first ask for them. Remember, you are the only one who knows what it feels like to you to write. Your doctor can help to make recommendations and ask that they be implemented. Would any of these accommodations make your work more manageable?


A workspace more suited to your size or work habits (e.g. a chair and table of a more suitable height, a slanted or elevated work surface)
A different selection of writing implements

A different means of writing (such as dictation or typing in lieu of writing longhand)
A different blend or proportion of writing and non-writing tasks.

Use fun pens.",How to Have Girly Handwriting," There are an infinite number of possible handwriting styles, and a large number of factors that determine an individuals handwriting style. This means that everyone's handwriting is unique, which is why it is sometimes used a legitimate method of identification, such as during court trials., Although there are many theories about the differences between male and female handwriting, it turns out, people aren't actually that good at differentiating between the two. Some generalities can be made, such as women's handwriting being neater on average. Women tend to write slower, and larger, with more attention to detail.One study found that prenatal hormones in women can predict the femininity of their handwriting., Since one of the major differences between male and female handwriting is neatness, you can make your handwriting more girly just by improving your handwriting in general. The first step to improving your handwriting is analyzing how you write now.Take out a sheet of lined paper and a pen.
Write the sentence ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" a couple of times. This sentence contains the whole alphabet.
Note the areas that could use improvement. Does your handwriting slant or is it upright? Do you vary the length and height of your letters? Circle the letters you like the look of the least.

, Find a spot to begin practicing. You should have a hard, flat surface to write on, paper, a pen, and a chair. Sit with your back straight. Use your non-dominant hand to balance yourself., Stretch your arms and hands. Loosen up your wrist and get your hand nice and relaxed before you begin to practice each day., The best way to hold the pen is to grip it between your thumb, index finger, and middle finger, with the back resting on your first knuckle., Your handwriting will instantly become more relaxed and flowing if you start moving the pen by moving your arm, while keeping your wrist and fingers still. This may make it harder to write carefully at first, but it's a habit that will help you in the long run.When first practicing writing like this, make big letters on the page. Exaggerate the size of your words and slowly bring the size back down as you get used to writing with your arm.

, Good letter formation takes careful concentration, especially if you aren't used to writing well. This means you need to take your time with each word and each letter. You can start to speed up slowly as you improve., You should be practicing all of these handwriting techniques every day. Start each day with simple lines and shapes. Make vertical lines over and over, working on keeping the lines straight and the spaces between them even. Do the same with some circles, and slanted lines. Then move on to writing letters over and over, until you consistently like the look of them., Once you've got a better handle on the shapes you're forming, focus on consistency. Your letters should be sized consistency across the page. This will make your handwriting look neat and orderly. Try to keep the angle of your handwriting consistent too, both the slanting of the letters and the angle at which you draw crossbars on letters like ""t"" and ""f""., The easiest way to get a head start on making your handwriting more feminine is to copy handwriting that you consider feminine. Find an example of feminine handwriting, print it out, and use tracing paper to trace over the writing. Then try copying the handwriting style from sight, rather than tracing.If you have a female friend or sibling with particularly feminine handwriting, you can ask to borrow an example of theirs.
In addition to tracing and copying examples of feminine handwriting, you also spend some time just analyzing what about the handwriting gives it a feminine look.

, One generality that separates male from female handwriting is that women tend to use less pressure when writing. Writing with your arm rather than your fingers will do a lot to help this, but it can't hurt to take some extra care to lighten your pressure as you write., Feminine handwriting tends to borrow some its characteristics from cursive. So one way to add a more girly flair to your handwriting is to start introduction more curves to your letters.For example:


You can write ""t""s with little curves at the bottom, rather than just a simple straight line.
You can exaggerate the curves in the feet of letters like ""a"" and ""Q"".
Use flourishes to add feminine detail to your letters. For example, maybe the bottom foot of your lowercase ""k""s can flourish upwards at the end. Or maybe your ""w""s can start with a small upward curve instead of just going straight downwards.

, Feminine handwriting tends to have fuller counters, meaning that the space within each letter is fuller. You can also add space in places which normally have none, like making your dots (as you would on the letter 'i') small circles. This is an easy way to add a stereotypically girly flair to your letters., Slanting your letters can add to the cursive quality of your handwriting. Whether you slant your words to the left or the right, just make sure your slant is consistent. This goes along with keeping your handwriting neat and tidy, a characteristic of feminine handwriting., If your handwriting is already girly, try experimenting with your own styles. Curve your A's at the top, or dot your lowercase I's with special symbols like stars or hearts. Personalize your writing and make it beautiful!

, Vibrant, glittery colored pens, though not technically part of your ""handwriting"", can add just the right amount of pop to your girly handwriting. If you write with friends, the outside of the pen can be just as important as the color, so try to pick pens that look pretty and colorful. Make sure to avoid using pens in classes like Math and Science, because these subjects often have strict teachers who only accept work written in pencil. Sometimes these teachers do allow erasable pens, so don't be afraid to ask!

Weight train with your left hand.,
Do daily tasks with your left hand.,
Switch your computer mouse.,
Try catching with your left hand.",How to Learn to Write With Your Left Hand1," Use light weights to strengthen your fingers and wrist.


The stronger your left hand becomes, the easier it will be to hold a pen/pencil.
You’ll be able to focus on writing well if you’re left hand is stronger. This is because it won’t get fatigued as you attempt to write.
Flexibility is just as important as strength. Keep your hand flexible to keep it from cramping when you start writing.;
, Once you’ve strengthened the fingers and wrist of your left hand, begin doing basic daily tasks. The more you use your left hand, the more comfortable you’ll be with it. Start out with the most basic tasks and work your way to more difficult ones.


Eat and drink with your left hand. Cutting your food the opposite way and pouring drinks with your left hand will engage your brain as well as continue to strengthen your left hand. This is a good place to start because it won’t interfere with your daily schedule.
Open and close with your left hand. Doors, buttons, bags, and drawers are all great places to start using your left hand. Remember that buttons and doorknobs that twist will be more awkward than drawers that simply slide open.

, Many of us use our computer mouse for hours on end. Start to use your left hand to use the mouse of your computer. You can switch the mouse’s buttons easily with your settings.Enter “mouse” in your Start menu search and select the first entry.
Check the “Switch primary and secondary buttons” box.
You can either use your mouse with your left hand from here, or you can download left-handed mouse pointers to make the process easier.

Start with the alphabet.,
Move on to sentences.,
Keep an eye on your grip.,
Write without comparing.,
Begin to freewrite.",How to Learn to Write With Your Left Hand2," Write the alphabet out with your right hand. Underneath it, attempt to match each letter using your left hand now that it is strong enough to do so. Remember to practice uppercase and lowercase.


Write in the mirror. Place a mirror facing your paper and write with your right hand. This mirror image will help your brain imagine the same action for your left hand.
Buy a writing book. Trace the dotted lines to form letters and get the form correct on your letters.
Repeat as necessary. Some letters will be more difficult than others for you. Repeat the difficult ones as many times as necessary to get it right.

, Remember to start small; just write a few lines each day and you’ll see improvement over time.


Continue using guide sentences as necessary. Just as you did with the alphabet, write these sentences with your right hand and copy them beneath with your left hand.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence has every letter in the alphabet; therefore, it is a great sentence to practice.

, If you feel that your hand is cramping, or you’re having difficulty holding the pen/pencil, buy a left handed grip for your writing utensil. They have them with the finger form built in, so that you know how to hold your hand on the pen/pencil.

, Now that you’ve mastered short sentences, you will begin to trust your left hand more. You no longer need to have writing examples around you to compare your letters and words to while writing with your left hand.


Write out your planner (if you have one) with your left hand. These short sentences through the day will help you advance the skills of your left hand.
Take your time. Without having examples to compare your writing to, you’ll be engaging your brain more than before. Be patient and get each letter right.

, Freewriting will help you write more naturally and quickly with your left hand.


Come up with a topic to write about. It can be as random, realistic, or significant as you wish.
Give yourself an allotted amount of time and begin a timer.
Start. Using your left hand, let your mind take control. Write as much as you can about your topic in the allotted amount of time.

Practicing your left handed writing daily will keep your cognitive performance at a high level.

, Continue improving on your left handed writing by beginning to draw.


Begin with very basic shapes: squares, triangles, and circles.
Work your way up to more difficult drawings. The more your movements become directed but natural with your left hand, the easier it will be to maintain your left handed writing.

, Using both your right and left hand improves connection of the left and right brain hemispheres. If you switch entirely to your writing with your left hand, you will lose writing skills in your right hand.

Practice tracing these letters on a blank piece of paper.First trace the letters on a lined sheet of paper and then move to a blank sheet.
Some pens work better than others. Try gel ink pens and calligraphy pens, however, if you cannot find those then a pencil will work just fine but will not have quite the same.
A light box will be very useful for tracing the letters.;
, Instead of printing, try writing your daily notes, homework and other handwriting in a distinctive cursive style. Emphasize the loops in letters and try not to jumble words together. Take your time and really concentrate on making your cursive look pretty.

, It might help your writing if you practice copying something that you enjoy reading. In your elegant cursive, write what you are reading into your journal or notebook. Take your time and emphasize your style. You can also use line paper if you are still trying to master your style.

, Elegant handwriting can be thicker or thinner depending on the type of writing utensil used. Markers are going to give you a larger font, while pens and pencils will be skinnier. Try out different writing tools and find one that works for you.


Your art teacher or an employee at an art supply store should be able to recommend different writing tools for you to use.

, Buy a lined paper that has an extra-large space for writing. Think of the kind of paper that you learned to write on when you were little. Slowly write your elegant letters, being sure to fill up the entire space. With practice, you will eventually be able to do this without the lines.


Take your time and really concentrate on filling the space.

, By practicing this visual art, you will learn how to write multiple styles of elegant handwriting. Calligraphy teaches you how to write elegantly with different tools in different medium. You will also develop the skills produce your own unique styles and fonts. If you stick with it, you will eventually be able to print, paint or chisel beautiful words on almost anything. There are workbooks and classes that you can take online to learn calligraphy.
Your local community center or YMCA may also offer classes in calligraphy.

, The muscles in the arm, shoulder, chest and back should be conducting all of the action while you write. Your forearm, hand and fingers should be still. Writing from your shoulder results in movement that is more intricate and gives you greater stamina. It also creates smoother and cleaner looking writing.


This movement will likely feel unnatural at first but it is crucial to developing your writing.
Avoid writing with your fingers. The majority of people “draw” their letters by moving the pen across the paper with their hand. This method is more tiresome and gives you less control over your writing.
Be conscious of writing with your shoulder, making it a part of your writing practice.

, Concentrate on writing using your shoulder and not your hand. Practice this until it feels natural. As you become more comfortable with the movement, make the letters smaller.You can also practice this method on a marker or chalk board.

, Start with big letters and gradually move to smaller ones. Again, remember to avoid writing with your fingers and concentrate on your shoulder.

, Start making Xs and ///s and OOOs and overlapped OOOs and spirals and | | | |s. Work on making this figures smoothly, uniformly, and evenly spaced. Practice drawing these figures daily emphasizing your strokes and movement. Repetition is important so practice these movements daily.

, Focus on making clear, well-formed letters and words. Hurriedly writing results in messy or illegible writing. Remember that you want to write elegantly and that takes time., If you begin to get sore or fatigued, your writing will suffer. Get out of your chair and walk around. Stretch the muscles in your shoulder and hand. , There is not magic bullet for developing elegant handwriting. Daily practice is the only way to hone your skill and, luckily, there are many strategies for doing this.Set aside at least 20 minutes a day to write. Begin with five minutes and work your way up.
Follow the curriculum laid out in a handbook or online lesson. These tend to have daily exercises as part of their instruction.
Write things out by hand more. Hand-write your notes and grocery lists. Start a journal and send written letters to friends and family. Keep a pocketbook.

, Hold it near the writing end. It is important to have the proper grip on your writing utensil. Think of your hand as the vice that holds the pen in place while you write. Try not to rest it between the thumb and index finger with the barrel on the middle finger.
Avoid placing the pen between thumb and the index and middle fingers with the pen resting on you ring finger.

, Relax your hand while you hold the pen. Your grip needs to be firm but not so tight that your hand is tense. Having a loose grip helps relax your arm and give it greater dexterity. Imagine that the pen is made of soft rubber and that squeezing it too tightly will cause ink to blot everywhere.

, Do not curl your hand over and write to the left of your palm. That position can leading to hand cramping and discomfort.This is an important tip for lefties to remember since they are more likely to curl their hand.

, This will help you steady yourself and provide better control to your dominant hand. It will also keep the paper from moving around. Be sure you are practicing on a surface that has space to balance yourself with your other arm.


Think about your dominant hand and position yourself in a way that gives you room to both balance and write.

, The paper position ensures the correct slant of your letters. Your letters should ideally have a 35-degree slant.If you are right-handed, the bottom-left corner of the paper should be aligned with the top-right.
If you are left-handed, the top-left corner should be aligned with the bottom-right corner.

, Keep your spine straight and be sure to have enough space to move your shoulder freely. Try to stay loose and not be too tense while writing. Find a comfortable hard-backed chair to sit on.Avoid sitting on a couch or a recliner.

, It needs to feel comfortable to hold and move across the paper smoothly without requiring you to push it too hard on the paper. Depending on how elegant you want your handwriting to look, you may want to invest in different writing utensils.Fountain pens are believed to be the superior tool for handwriting. The expenses associated with a fountain pen are slightly higher due to the need to buy ink.
Mechanical pens and pencils are also great choice. They allow you to try out different sized nibs and thicknesses, as well as colors.
If you are left-handed, there are special pens designed just for you.
For those looking for a more rustic look, a quill might be worth looking into.

, For practicing, you will want grid-lined paper because it will help you write lower and upper case letters, as well as track your progress. There are colored and raised papers for the visual perceptual challenged., If you have access to it, a drawing or drafting table is ideal for handwriting. Experts recommend writing at a 45-degree angle; however, a kitchen table or office desk will also work.Depending on the type of handwriting you are doing you might want to invest in a light box, which will help you write on paper without a grid., These workbooks have daily exercises to help you refine your writing. Depending on your skill level, there are also advanced books teach specific styles and scripts. You can take handwriting courses online and some tablets have tools that will help you practice your writing.

Always handwrite things.",How to Improve Your Handwriting," Choose a topic—anything really—and write at least five sentences about it. If you’re not feeling too creative, simply copy a passage out of a book or newspaper. The goal is to get an idea of what your handwriting looks like on average. The more you write, the more accurate your analysis will be.
;
, Is your handwriting full of loops and curves? Is it primarily straight lines and stiff in appearance? Do you have hard corners, or do your letters blend together?


, The angle at which you write your letters can make or break your handwriting. Is your handwriting perpendicular to the lines under it? Does it fall to the left or to the right significantly? A slight slant is typically not a problem, but too much of one can make reading difficult.


, Do your words tend to be written on an upwards or downwards angle? Do they overlap with the lines on the page? Is every word individually angled, or do your entire lines of text head in a similar direction away from the line?


, The distance between your words and letters helps determine the quality of your handwriting. There should be enough space between each word to fit the letter “O.” Using more or less space than this can be an indicator of poor handwriting. Pay attention also to the closeness of each individual letter. Cramped writing or letters that are spaced far apart are also difficult to read.


, Turns out size does matter, at least with handwriting. Does your writing fill up the entire space between two lines? Can you write all your words in less than half the space between two lines? Taking up a large amount of space or using too little are both things to avoid.


, Look at the actual lines that comprise your writing. Are they drawn with heavy pressure, or are they faint and hard to read? Are your lines straight, or are they kind of squiggly and uneven?


, Considering all of the aforementioned, what is it that your handwriting needs in order to improve? Possible changes can be made to the shape of letters, your spacing, alignment, writing size, line quality, and the slant of words. Changing one or more of these will improve your overall handwriting legibility., So now you know your letters are too large and your shapes too round, now what? Go onto font websites and look for handwriting samples that you like. Make a copy of each style of handwriting that is feasible for you to mimic. Don’t be afraid to look for samples that might vary significantly from your own handwriting, as you can pick and choose certain aspects of different handwritings rather than adopting an entirely new one.


, Most of the time, people with poor or illegible handwriting simply haven’t properly trained the correct muscle groups in their hands, arms, and shoulders. Avoid “drawing” letters with your hand, and instead write by moving your entire arm up to the shoulder. To practice doing this, the easiest thing is to write sentences in the air using your finger. This forces you to use the muscle groups in your arm and shoulder that help to improve handwriting and keep it from looking messy or cramped.









, Your pen or pencil should be held between your thumb and index and (optional) middle fingers. The end of the writing utensil should rest against either the web of your hand or against the knuckle of your index finger. Holding your pencil too tightly or loosely (in this position or others) will result in poor handwriting. Hold the pencil in the bottom ⅓ for the best results., A consistent flaw in poor handwriting is irregularity and inconsistency between letters and shapes. All the letters are made up out of straight lines and circles or semi-circles, so put in some time drawing these. Fill an entire sheet of paper with parallel vertical lines, and parallel diagonal lines. Do the same with a sheet of ‘o’ shapes as well. When you can consistently make the same line over and over, you are ready to move onto complete letters.








, Although everyone seems to do it a bit differently, there is a certain way to write each letter of the alphabet. Following the correct direction of the line that forms each letter can greatly improve your handwriting. For example, rather than starting a lowercase ‘a’ with the tail, begin at the top of the loop. Practice writing every letter in the correct direction, just like how you were taught in kindergarten.









, Although it may seem nit-picky, different people are able to write better (or worse!) using different writing utensils. Try a variety of tools including a ballpoint, roll-on, and felt pen in addition to traditional and mechanical pencils. Finding one that you enjoy writing with may be enough to improve your handwriting on its own.


, Yes, just like in first grade, fill up rows upon rows of lines with each letter of the alphabet in lower and uppercase. Use your font inspiration that you gathered as well as your handwriting analysis to focus on what you need to change. If slanting is your problem, make it a point to keep your letters vertical. If you are trying to change the shapes of your letters, concentrate simulating the shapes you see in the handwriting inspiration you’ve chosen.


, When you’re certain of your every letter’s perfection, practice writing them in full words and sentences. Write the phrase “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” over and over again—this particular sentence contains every letter of the alphabet, giving you ample practice time. Although it may seem monotonous, the adage ‘practice makes perfect’ certainly applies here.


, Pass up the option to type that essay outline or to pop off an email catching up with a friend, and instead make the effort to handwrite your work. Taking the opportunity to write things by hand whenever possible will be the most beneficial practice in improving your handwriting. It may take a bit longer, but you’ll be building up the muscles that are necessary for easy and smooth writing."

Choose the right tools.,
Sit upright but comfortably.Yes, your mother was right -- posture counts.,
Hold on loosely.,
Make your content more beautiful.,
Seek inspiration.",How to Have Beautiful Writing1," Some people prefer pen, others pencil. Some like them larger, others smaller. The important thing is to find a writing instrument that feels right in your hand.Consider a pen or pencil with a soft grip, especially if you tend to grip too tightly.
Use lined paper for practice, and sturdier paper if you are writing something to keep.;
, Hunching over your paper will make your neck and back sore after a while, and it also restricts your arm movement so that you will over-utilize your hand and wrist in writing (see Method 2, Step 3 below).


If you can sit up straight as a rail and be comfortable, great. But don’t make yourself overly rigid and uncomfortable. Beautiful writing should not be a painful chore.

, Grasp the pen, don’t choke it. (They say a good craftsman never blames his tools.) If you have an indentation or red mark on your finger when you finish writing, you’re holding on too tight. A looser hold enables a better range of motion and allows the letters to flow more freely from your pen.


There are plenty of “right” ways to hold a pen or pencil. Some pin it against the middle finger with the index finger and thumb, some press with the fingertips of all three fingers; some rest the back of the pen on the index finger base knuckle, some on the webbing between index finger and thumb.
Instead of spending time forcing yourself to utilize a new grip, go with what is comfortable for you -- unless you find that you use an awkward grip that negatively affects the quality of your writing.So long as you’re utilizing your first two fingers and thumb, it should work fine.

, Sure, it’s fine to use abbreviations, symbols, non-sentences, etc. when jotting down notes, but especially when something that another person will see, take the time to write properly. A shiny, clean car that’s missing two wheels and the hood doesn’t look as beautiful as a complete one.


Make sure you have the appropriate capitalization and punctuation marks.
Don't use text speech or internet abbreviations. If you are writing anything other people are going to read, don't use text writing: Gr8, bcuz, u, soz, lols, etc.

, Do you know someone with beautiful handwriting? Watch him or her write and ask for some pointers. You may even want to look at word processor fonts for inspiration on letter shapes.


Don’t be too proud to seek out writing lessons and workbooks marketed for schoolchildren. For that matter, if you have children, practice together. Turn family bonding time into better penmanship for all.

If you’d prefer, you can purchase a handwriting workbook, such as Write Now by Barbara Getty and Inga Dubay.

, In order to improve your handwriting, you need to evaluate your starting point. Take out your pen and notebook and write a paragraph (at least 4-6 lines of text) about anything you want (even nonsense words). Then spend some time carefully evaluating each aspect of your lettering. What are your strengths and weaknesses? Try to notice:

The shapes of your letters
The slant of your words (and whether or not it is consistent)
The spaces between letters and words
The size of your letters
The alignment of your writing (moving upward or downward; overlapping with other words)

, To best improve your handwriting in 30 days, you need to focus on some specific elements you’d like to improve. Choose one or two elements of your handwriting that you’d really like to change, and focus on these as you practice.Some areas for improvement might include:

Letters that are squished together
Letters that are too far apart
Letters that are difficult to read
Too sharp of a angle to your letters

, In order to improve your handwriting, it can be helpful to see examples of handwriting that you like. You can follow Instagram accounts dedicated to bullet journaling or calligraphy. Or you can visit some typography websites in order to see a wide variety of letter types.Some websites include:

Google fonts
Typewolf
MyFonts
FontShop

, In order for this to work in just 30 days, you have to be dedicated every day. Fortunately, you only need about 20-30 minutes of practice daily. Schedule your handwriting practice each day, and do not allow other obligations to get in the way.It can be helpful to do this at the same time each day, so that you form a habit.
If other people try to interrupt this time, explain that this is important to you.

, Each day, the bulk of your practice will involve the handwriting worksheets you have chosen. Whether you are using downloaded worksheets, or you have purchased a workbook, the sheets should be organized from the most basic to the most difficult. Carefully complete three worksheets every day, following the instructions provided. Remember to focus on the 1-2 areas you specifically want to improve.

This should take 15-20 minutes.
If it takes you a bit longer, that’s OK. Just do as much as you can, and don’t rush.

, The second part of your daily writing practice will be writing the entire alphabet (in capital and lowercase letters). As you do this, slowly refine each letter, creating the look you desire. Keep in mind the slant of your letters (aiming to be consistent), and the spacing between them.This should take about five minutes.

, Look back at some of your handwriting inspirations from before. Each day, choose one that you’d like to emulate. Then try to copy the look of that handwriting, letter by letter. Pay attention to how they connect letters (or not), any decorative flourishes they use, and the shapes and angles they create.Spend around five minutes on this.

, If you want to maintain an attractive handwriting, you will need to continue practicing even after your 30 days are up. Fortunately, you can make this fun, and put your new and improved handwriting to good use. Find a handwriting project that inspires you, and commit to working on it at least three times per week.You might:

Start a bullet journal

There is more than one style of cursive, of course, and it is fine to give your cursive an individual flare, as long as it is still legible. But it’s probably best to start out by copying an existing style.
Seek out websites with study tutorials and printable practice sheets.Some even have animations of the pen strokes used to make each letter., Most people write by manipulating their fingers, what is called by some “drawing” the letters. Handwriting artists utilize their arms and shoulders as they write, which facilitates a better flow and thus less angular, choppy handwriting.Try “air writing.” You may feel silly doing it, but it will help re-train your muscles.Pretend you are writing large letters on a chalkboard. (In fact, you can practice writing on a chalkboard.) You will naturally use shoulder rotation and forearm movement to construct your letters.
As you become more proficient at air writing, reduce the size of your invisible letters and assume the positioning you would take to put pen to paper.But continue to focus on using your shoulder and arm, not your fingers.

, The two essential moves in cursive handwriting are the upsweep and the curve, so practice them first before writing full letters.You'll want your practice stokes and eventually letters to be evenly spaced, so lined paper will be really useful here. If you want to write on a blank piece of paper, put in light, evenly spaced pencil lines with a ruler and erase the lines once you've written your letters.
To practice the upsweep, start the pen just above the baseline, brush against the baseline as you pull down and slightly forward, then turn the curve upward into a straight line (angled slightly forward) through the midline and to the topline.
The basic curve practice stroke resembles a lowercase “c.” Start just below the midline, pull up and back to make nearly a complete counterclockwise, forward-leaning oval (taller than wide), brushing against the midline and baseline as you go and stopping about three-fourths of the way up to your starting point.
As you move on to practicing whole letters and combinations, don’t forget about the connections. In cursive, they are the “air,” the space between pen strokes when the pen is lifted in script writing. Proper connections will make your cursive writing not only more beautiful, but faster.

, Cursive writing is about writing faster by reducing pen lifts, but start out by practicing forming each letter and connection deliberately and precisely. Pick up the pace only as you master the form. Think of cursive writing as an art, because it is one.

Get the right tools.,
Set up your paper properly.,
Position yourself and your pen.,
Practice primary strokes.,
Take your time.,
Consider taking a class.",How to Have Beautiful Writing3," To get the attractive appearance of your calligraphy strokes appearing thick and thin, you'll need to make sure that you have the proper pens, paper and ink.


The best writing utensils for calligraphy are broad-edged ones like markers, fountain pens, brushes, quills, reeds, or staff with inserted tips (called nibs).
Make sure that you have paper that ink won't bleed through. Practicing on plain, standard notebook paper is fine, but you'll need to test that the ink won't bleed through. Most stationery stores sell paper that is made for calligraphy.
If you're going to use inks, avoid India drawing inks because the lacquer in them has a tendency to clog the pen and rust the nib. You’re better off using a water soluble ink.

, This means understanding where the lines go so that your calligraphy has uniformity of appearance.


You definitely want to choose lined paper for practice. Either use pre-lined paper, place paper with dark lines under your practice sheet, or use a pencil and ruler to draw parallel lines on your practice sheet.
You'll need to set a nib height -- that is, the space between guide lines as measured by the width of your pen nib. (The width of the widest part of your pen tip equals 1 “nib” in this equation). A common standard is 5 nibs between guidelines.The guidelines include the baseline, the waistline, and the ascending and descending lines.
The baseline is the writing line that all letters rest on.
The waistline is the line above the baseline, which changes according to the x-height of the letter (in this case, 5 nibs above baseline).
The ascending line marks the height that all ascending letters (such as a lowercase “h” or “l”) hit. It will be 5 nibs above the waistline (or whichever nib height you're using).
The descending line is where descending letters (such as lowercase “g” or “p”) hit below the baseline. It will be in this example 5 nibs below the baseline.

, As advised to improve any style of writing, sit with your feet on the floor and your back straight (but not uncomfortably rigid). Likewise, hold the pen so that it is under control but not in a vise grip, or your hand may cramp.Calligraphy requires you to hold your pen nib at a 45 degree angle. To make sure that you're holding your pen at a 45 degree angle, draw a right angle (90 degrees) with a pencil. Draw a line upward from the corner of the angle that cuts the right angle in half. If it's a thin line, then you're holding your pen properly., In calligraphy, these include the vertical downstroke, push/pull strokes, and branching strokes.For the vertical downstroke, practice drawing thick, straight lines down from the ascending line to the baseline and the waistline to the baseline. Slightly lean the line forward after some practice. Eventually you will add “tails” (short thin-line strokes) to the beginning and end of your downstrokes, but save that for later practice.
For push-pull strokes, make short, thick horizontal lines along the waistline. This stroke will make the tops of a lowercase “a,” “g”, the cross of a “t,” and others. You may eventually add a slight wave and/or tails to this stroke, but stick to a straight line at first.
For branching strokes, make a curved line, slightly leaned forward, from the baseline to the ascending line and waistline to baseline. You will use this motion to make lowercase “n” and “v,” for example. Practice starting the line thick and ending thin and vice versa -- you will need to be able to do both.
As you improve with these motions, make shapes like boxes, triangles, and ovals before moving on to the actual letter forms. Pay special attention to keeping the 45 degree angle.

, Unlike cursive, in calligraphy each letter requires one or more pen lifts. As you move into practicing letters, focus on each stroke used to make a letter. Get each piece of the puzzle in place, then assemble that letter.

, If you are serious about learning calligraphy, you may want to consider seeking out a calligraphy class at an art school or perhaps even a community center. Calligraphy is truly an art form, and proper, guided instruction can prove very helpful to many aspiring calligraphers. But even self-taught calligraphy can be beautiful and improve your writing form in general.

Study your current signature.,
Research signatures.,
Identify what font you like.,
Write capital letters.,
Practice constantly.,
Be consistent.,
Choose a size.,
Assess legibility.,
Consider your initials.,
Decide which names to use.,
Use post-nominal titles sparingly.",How to Have a Nice Signature," Sign your name on a piece of paper and look at it carefully. What do you wish you could do differently? Identifying the changes you would like to make will help you make a plan for improving your signature.


Assess readability. Could someone decipher your name or initials easily by looking at it?
Think about whether you would prefer a cursive or print signature, or a mixture of both.
Look at specific letters, particularly your initials. Do you like the way they look, or is there a particular letter that you think is not very appealing?;
, Finding a style that you like may help you decide what changes to adopt. Begin by researching the signatures of people that you admire. You may find inspiration in their autographs.


If you are an artist planning to sign your work, focus on the work of other artists. Consider the medium used; a painted signature is often more simple than a written one, but it should still be distinctive.
Research historical signatures. In the past penmanship was a more important skill, so you may find examples of beautiful handwriting from people in the nineteenth or early twentieth century. The signatures of presidents or prominent writers are easy to find online.

, If you are drawn to ornate cursive letters, vintage penmanship manuals may provide good inspiration. You may want a more angular and jagged look. Searching through font databases, or checking a calligraphy book out from a library may help you decide on a preferred style.


When you find a font, print or make a photocopy of the suggested alphabet. You may find several that appeal so choose your favorite letters from each.

, Your initials will be the most prominent part of your signature and should be both personal and legible. You may often be writing only your initials.Try out flourishes such as loops to see how you like them.
Practice the capital letters in your name over and over until you are pleased with how they look.

, In order to consistently produce a signature that you like, you need to practice at every opportunity. Your hand will learn the rhythm and pattern of your signature through repetition until finally you don’t need to think consciously about it.


Every time you need to sign something make a point of trying to do your new signature.
Write your name over and over again on a notepad. You can do this during classes or meetings when you might otherwise doodle, or sitting at home while watching television.
Eventually your signature will become second nature.

, Your autograph is an important identifier. When you have established a new signature be sure that it is on the back of any credit cards and that you use it consistently when signing documents and receipts. When others compare your signature to verify your identity it should be a close match.

, How large your signature is sends a message about your confidence in yourself. A signature that is larger than the surrounding print sends a message of high self-confidence, but it may also be read as bravado or a front. A signature that is smaller may reflect self-motivation but it can also appear that the writer lacks confidence.To begin with it may be best to use a medium size signature. This conveys a sense of balance and modesty.

, Often those who write illegibly attribute this to lack of time, but it does not take significantly longer to write a readable name.


A signature that cannot be easily deciphered or read may send the message that the writer believes his or her identity should be obvious to all.
This may come across as arrogant or careless., Using an initial in lieu of a first name can send a message of formality. Some initials spell out words with which you may not want to be associated.


If your initials form an acronym or a word, avoid using them.
If you are trying to promote a friendly casual atmosphere in your workplace, use your first name as part of your signature and in your communications.
If you are trying to establish a businesslike hierarchical relationship, use a first initial in place of your given name to send a message of formality.

, How much of your signature you write may depend on the circumstances. Very few people are universally known by only one name. Celebrities can get away with signing just their first name to everything, but in most cases this is not a good idea.


If your name is very common, and the recipient of your communication might be confused, it is best to write both names or even include a middle initial to distinguish yourself.
If you have a close relationship with the reader and wish to send a message of intimacy, consider using only your first name. Letters to family members are a good example of this.
Use a job title such as Professor or Doctor only in formal communications with subordinates. This can be helpful in reestablishing a businesslike atmosphere with someone who is too casual.

, If you have worked hard to earn a professional or academic qualification it can be tempting to add letters such as BA or MD to the end of your signature. Post-nominals are used only professionally and should never be used socially.Add post-nominals when professionally relevant. RN, MD and PhD all convey a professional qualification. Associates and bachelor’s degrees generally do not, and so should not be added to a signature. The information can be included in your resume.
Military ranks and professional or academic degrees are not used together. If you have both types of honors, use only the military distinction. If the context clearly indicates use of the professional degree, omit the military rank.
Consider the context. If you are a professor and everyone in your department has a PhD you may come across as foolish by insisting on this designation amongst your peers. In such cases be formal with subordinates if you choose and less formal with peers.

Place a piece of tracing paper over the original signature.,
Use a pencil to lightly trace the signature.,
Place the tracing paper over the blank spot where you want to copy the signature.,
Make a signature impression.,
Remove the tracing paper and write the signature in pen.",How to Forge a Signature1," Tracing paper is made to be translucent, so you can clearly see what's underneath it. If you don't have a piece of tracing paper handy, you can use a piece of thin white computer paper.;
, Use a steady hand and slowly trace over the lines, loops and dots in the signature. Try not to shake your hand or pick up the pencil as you trace. In order to produce a convincing signature, pay attention to the following:


The thickness of the lines. People naturally apply more pressure to certain parts of their signature. Maybe the right side of the person's ""l"" loop is thicker than the left side, for example.
The slant of the signature. As you trace, pay attention to the natural slant of the signature and be sure to follow it.
The order of the letter formation. For instance, does it look like the person crossed his Ts dotted his Is after completing the rest of the signature? This can affect the way the final signature looks. It's a subtle matter, but it can mean the difference between a decent forgery and one that's easy to call out as fake.

, Be sure it's aligned correctly so that it will look like it was signed in a natural way. Many people don't sign their signatures neatly and in a straight line, so take this into account when you're positioning the signature.

, Use a pencil or another pointed instrument to press fairly hard over the traced signature to make an impression of the signature on the desired forging area. Don't press so hard that you tear the paper or change the way the signature will look.


A deep impression will be noticeable as a sign of forgery, so try to make it as faint as possible while still leaving enough of an indent that you'll be able to go over it in pen.

, Carefully go over the indented signature with a pen. Don't lift your hand or make any shaky movements - try to make it look natural.

Introduce the author in the sentence.,
Alternatively, name the author in the parentheses.,
Specify the year of publication.,
Separate multiple citations with semicolons.,
Substitute the title for the author's name, if needed.",How to Write In‐Text Citations1," Whenever it is available, you must include the last name of the author or authors responsible for the work. One way to name the author is to introduce him or her in the sentence before you introduce the information provided by that author.


According to Jones, this premise is false (2010).
A study by Smith, Doe and Rowell indicates that this is only a misconception (2002).;
, If you do not introduce the author or authors in the sentence, provide the last names in parentheses after the borrowed information. For works with multiple authors, separate the last two names with an ampersand (&).


This premise is false (Jones, 2010).
Even though it was previously accepted as fact, this is only a misconception (Smith, Doe & Rowell, 2002).

, Whenever available, include the date of publication in parentheses following the borrowed information. If the author's name is included in parentheses, as well, separate the two with a comma. If no date is provided, indicate as much with the abbreviation “n.d.”


Erikson claims otherwise (1999).
Some experts claim otherwise (Erikson, 1999).
Research shows that this long-held belief is “nothing more than an old wives' tale, at best” (Johnson & Smith, n.d.).

, If the quoted or paraphrased information comes from multiple sources, cite the author and year for both sources in parentheses as normal and separate the individual sources with semicolons. Alphabetize the studies as they would appear in your reference list.


Many wonder if the facts have been exaggerated (Doe & Simmons, 2009; Williams, 2007).

, If the author's name is not provided, include the title of the book in italics or the title of the article in quotation marks. Follow the title with the year of publication as usual. If not publication date is provided, use the abbreviation ""n.d.""

Study the original.,
Try turning it upside down.,
Trace the signature several times.,
Practice freehanding.,
Write it with confidence.",How to Forge a Signature2," Look closely at the signature and pay attention to how it was formed. Everyone writes their signature a little differently, and chances are if you try to reproduce it without studying it first, you'll make some obvious mistakes. Pay attention to these factors as you take in the contours of the signature:


Look at places where the letters connect. Is there a lot of overlap between letters, or are there spaces between the letters?
Check out the formation of the letters. Are they legible? Misshapen? Scrunched together? Do they have dramatic flourishes?
Look at the height and size of the loops. Are they big and billowy? Small and sharp? Getting the loops right is central to a good forgery.
Examine the slant. Does the signature slant to the right or to the left? How much does it slant?
How much space does the signature take up on the line?

, It can help to look at the signature from another angle. Look at it as a drawing instead of a signature. This will help you approach it more objectively and enable you to recreate it for what it is, rather than getting your personal signature-writing habits involved.

, This will help you get a feel for the lines and curves of the other person's handwriting. Take care to try to mimic the motions of the person who originally signed his or her name.

, Now that you understand the signature, start writing it freely. You're going to need to practice a lot before it looks anything like the original. The difficulty of getting it right might surprise you! Signatures are tough to forge, which is one reason why they're still used as a way to verify a variety of legal documents.As you practice, note minor differences between the original signature and your practice signatures. Make adjustments as necessary.
Keep practicing until the act of writing the signature feels natural, and you can sign the name without pausing.

, When it's time to put pen to paper, you should be confident enough to sign the name without lifting the pen or spending too long writing it. A signature signed with confidence will look more authentic than one where it's obvious that a lot of time and care was taken to write it. Sign the name quickly and resist the urge to make changes - there's no going back now.

"
"
Pay attention to what you're writing.,
Don't retouch.,
Don't lift the pen.,
Make each signature a little different.",How to Forge a Signature3," Many first-time forgers pay too much attention to the original signature and forget to pay attention to what they're writing. If you're looking at the signature instead of your own pen and paper, your forgery is going to come out shaky and strange-looking. That's a dead giveaway that you've just signed someone else's signature.


If you don't have a lot of time to practice a signature before signing on the dotted line, your best bet is to first study the signature, taking note of all the important elements, and then sign it as naturally as possible while actually looking at what you're doing.

, Another big clue that a signature has been forged is when it's apparent that the signature was retouched. Think about it - do you go back and adjust your letters after signing your own name? No, you're probably fine with a slightly sloppily crossed ""t"" or a half-formed ""b."" It's abnormal to see spots where these natural errors have been painstakingly corrected.

, Again, think about how you sign your own name. You do it in one smooth motion, keeping your pen to the paper the whole time. A signature with little gaps indicating the person signing paused, picked up the pen, then started again is a big sign that it was forged. When you're forging a signature, avoid this big mistake and sign it as naturally as possible., People don't sign their names the exact same way every time. It's easy to spot forgeries when you see a series of signatures on many different documents that all look exactly the same. This is a problem you can run into if you're using tracing paper to forge signatures. Be sure to do something a little different every time to make the signatures look authentic.

Learn to hold your pen comfortably.,
Experiment with different writing utensils.,
Analyze your handwriting.",How to Develop Your Own Handwriting Style1," In order to develop basic penmanship skills, you should begin by learning how to hold your pen properly. Comfort is obviously the most important element when it comes to holding a pen or pencil, but you should also make sure that you are evenly distributing the pressure. For example, try and balance your pen evenly between your thumb, pointer, and middle finger. This will help you avoid cramping when you write and will give you the most control over your lettering.Hold the pen close to the tip for better grip and control.;
, In order to create a unique and personal penmanship, you should also find a pen or writing utensil that is comfortable to you. Pens can come in a variety of different types, most commonly ballpoint and gel, and you may find that you prefer one over the other. Consider the comfort level of the pen, thickness of the ink, and level of control you have while writing when testing out new pens., In order to create your own writing style, you will want to start by analyzing your current handwriting and looking for any areas or things that you would like to change. Try copying out a few paragraphs of text from a book or the internet in order to see any patterns in your writing that may emerge. Once you have analyzed the lettering, try writing the same passage again and this time concentrate to correct or change some of the things you didn’t like about the initial writing. Pay specific attention to the following features of your handwriting:Spacing
Slant
Style
Height of letters
Consistent baseline for letters

Use a comma to separate the author’s last name and initials. Then, place a period after the initials. If you need to list two authors for the same source, then use an ampersand between the two authors’ names instead of using the word and. If you need to list three to seven authors' names for one source, then place commas between the authors’ names and place an ampersand before the last author's name.To list more than seven authors, add a comma between the authors' names, then use an ellipses to stand in for any authors between the sixth author and the final author.

, After the date, the next item in each of your references should be the title of the source followed by a period. Also make sure that you only capitalize the first word in the title and the subtitle, if there is one.Italicize book titles. For example, Call of the wild.

Do not italicize journal, newspaper, or magazine titles. Just include these as normal text. For example, “Making the grade in chemistry: A story of trial and error.”

, You only need to include the publisher's location and name for books. After you list a book title, list the place of publication of the book. Include the city and state for U.S. Publications, or the city, state (or province) and country name for non-U.S. Publications. Follow this with a colon, then the name of the publisher. Follow the publisher's name with a period.Example: Boston, MA: Random House.
Example: New York, NY: Scribner.
Example: Palmerston North, New Zealand: Dunmore Press.

, After the title of an article, include the name of the publication. Use the full name of the journal, magazine, or newspaper, and use the same capitalization and punctuation that the publication uses. Capitalize all major words in publication titles and italicize the publication's name as well.For example, ReCall instead of RECALL, and Knowledge Management Research & Practice, not Knowledge Management Research and Practice.

Use the ampersand if the journal does, instead of spelling out the word and.


, Following the publication name, include the volume number, then the issue number in parentheses, and then the page numbers of the section you referenced in your essay.

Increase speed with dictation exercises.",How to Learn Shorthand," There are several systems of shorthand, and they differ from one another. You need to consider a few different things:


How much time do you have to learn the system?
How fast do you ultimately want to be able to write?
Is there a standard system of shorthand for your profession?;
, Gregg and Pitman have been the leading competing systems in English shorthand since the 19th century, and both have been adapted to several other languages, as well.Gregg was developed by John Robert Gregg in 1888 and has since undergone several adaptations. Gregg Pre-Anniversary and Anniversary refer to the system as outlined in 1916 and 1929, respectively. There is a heavy load of symbols to memorize, but the trade-off is writing over 200 words per minute.Pitman was developed by Sir Isaac Pitman in 1837. New Era Pitman, a streamlined version of the original theory dating back to 1922, is quite complex but also lets you write over 200 words per minute.Since thick and thin strokes represent different pairs of sounds, you'll need a steel-tipped pen to write. Also, you need lined paper, since the lines are also part of the system., Gregg Simplified can still get up to 200 words per minute. This version, introduced by McGraw-Hill in 1949, was the first shorthand intended for business rather than court reporting. There are significantly fewer things to memorize compared with Gregg Anniversary. , With these methods you can still write up to 160 words per minute, but they require a significantly shorter investment of time., Unlike symbol systems, where lines, curves and circles represent sounds, alphabetic systems are based on the alphabet. This makes them easier to learn, though you won't be able to achieve the same rapid speeds. Still, a good speedwriter could get up to 120 words per minute.Three examples of these are Speedwriting, AlphaHand, and Keyscript.

, Teeline is a hybrid system largely based on the forms of the alphabet. It is the preferred shorthand theory of the UK's National Council for the Training of Journalists and is taught to journalism majors there., Alternatively, you can order books about shorthand online.


Lots of books on shorthand are probably out of print. This is why the library, used bookstores, or online bookstores may offer you a wider selection of texts.
Some shorthand books are in the public domain and available for free download online.

, If you want to teach yourself shorthand, these kits are designed for you. They include records or tapes with dictation, texts, self-tests, and additional materials.


Bear in mind that these probably require a record player (phonograph) or cassette player., These publications can show how different words are written in shorthand.

, These include tutorials, dictations, and shorthand samples.

, Such classes may be offered online or in person.


Make sure you understand the terms of the course and that you have adequate time in your schedule to meet the workload.

, Claims that you can learn shorthand in a few hours should be taken with a dose of skepticism. The time it will take you depends on how often you practice, the difficulty of the system, and your goal speed. It may take as long as a year of hard work to really master a useful shorthand., You need to fully absorb the word-building principles first; speed comes from them., Try for at least 45 minutes to an hour, if you can. Remember, though, that even daily short sessions are better than one or two longer ones per week.

, Start with the alphabet, filling each line of a piece of notebook paper with one letter. Next, you'll move on to words, doing the same thing. When you're ready, you'll move on to common groups of words.Saying the words aloud as you write them helps your brain make the connection between the phonemic sound and the symbol., Shorthand dictations come in different speeds (words per minute), so you can work your way to an increasingly rapid pace.


Practice each speed (30, 40, 50, 60, etc.) until you're comfortable, then move on.
If you want to practice as much as possible, put dictations on your MP3 player and practice whenever you have a few extra minutes."

Look up fonts and handwriting styles on the internet.,
Copy handwriting that you like.,
Create consistent letters.,
Find a handwriting style that matches your personality.",How to Develop Your Own Handwriting Style2," Try a simple google image search to find unique ideas. Try searching penmanship styles and see what different types of lettering you can uncover. This is a great way to get ideas and choose a style that fits both your personality and penmanship style.


Pinterest also has numerous different ideas for writing fonts that you may want to explore while creating a unique handwriting style.

, Do you have a friend, family member, or colleague whose handwriting you like? Closely examine their handwriting and try to determine exactly what it is that you like about the style. Perhaps you are drawn to the way their letters flow together, or the consistency in size. Once you have discovered what you like about their writing try to incorporate some of their technique into your own penmanship.Try tracing their writing. The more you practice the easier it will be to bring some of their writing style into your own handwriting.

, Regardless of the type of handwriting you have decided on, cursive or print, you should create a set of consistent letters that you like and that look good together. When you write a letter the way you like it- with the appropriate height, curve, and slant- continue to write that letter over and over again and fill up an entire page. This will help you develop consistent lettering that is unique to your own individual style.Try writing a full page of upper and lower case letters for each letter in the alphabet.

, Many people believe that you can learn a lot about a person from studying their handwriting. Think about the type of person you are and try and come up with ways to make your personality shine through in your unique handwriting style. For example, if you are considered tough you may want to develop bold and angular lettering. Similarly, if you are an organized and tidy person, allow that to be reflected in your handwriting by creating crisp, neat, and uniform letters.

Use your handwriting on a daily basis.,
Slow down your handwriting.,
Ask someone to read your handwriting.",How to Develop Your Own Handwriting Style3," In today’s vastly digital world, many people can go days at a time without using their own handwriting. If you want to develop your own handwriting style, it is important that you practice handwriting daily. Although this may seem like a boring chore, there are ways to make writing fun:Start a daily handwritten journal.
Write letters to your friends and family. Who wouldn’t love to receive a handwritten note?
Write your name and practice your signature.

, While you are in the process of learning new handwriting skills, it is important to concentrate and write slowly. Writing neatly takes a lot of control, so you should not rush your writing while you are trying to change or create a new handwriting style., Once you have successfully developed a personal handwriting style, write a paragraph and ask a family member or friend to read it. If they can read the paragraph without any difficulty, congratulations, you've made your own personal handwriting script! If they have trouble, either practice more, or try to clean up the script. It is important to make sure that your handwriting is legible and easy to read.

Choose an online generator.,
Select auto-fill or manual-entry mode.,
Enter the title or url.,
Locate the correct work from the list provided.,
Click on the appropriate book title.,
Click on “Create Citation.” There should be a button at the bottom of the form prompting you to create the citation.,
Save your citations as you go.,
Check your work.",How to Write an APA Style Bibliography2," There are many good generators online that will format your citations automatically. Most of these are free services. Free generators that provide formatted citations instantly include Bibme and Citation Machine.Find a generator, and click the box that says “APA.”


Some generators require you to supply your email address and they will send you the citations. It's best to avoid these, because they may sell your information to businesses that will clog your inbox with spam.
Many searchable library databases also provide citations in multiple styles, such as EBSCO. If you are using your university library’s databases, then you should have the option of getting an APA style citation for the source from the article’s page in the database.
Just remember to check any references that you get from an online generator for accuracy because they may have errors.

, Most online generators default to the automatic entry method, but you should check to make sure you're in the right one. If you want to use the manual method instead, check that option now. Whether you use auto-fill or manual-fill is your personal preference.The auto-fill method will supply a lot of information instantly, which you will then verify to make sure it's correct.
The manual entry method will give you a form to complete yourself, and you will enter the appropriate author names, dates, and other relevant information manually.
Make sure to select the type of work you are citing. The BibMe generator has five main boxes: Journal, Website, Book, Video, and Other. Click on the box that corresponds to the type of work you need to cite., Depending on the type of source you need to cite, you may have a title or a url. You can enter either the title or the url into the generator's text entry box.For a journal, enter the title of the journal.
For a website, enter the URL or a keyword. Generally, using the url for the source will get more accurate results.
For a book, enter the book title, author's name, or ISBN. You can find the ISBN on the book jacket, usually next to the price and the barcode. The ISBN will provide the most complete information.
For a video, enter the URL or a major keyword. The URL will yield more specific results.
If you choose “Other,” you will see a long list of alternative formats to choose from. Select the one that is appropriate (e.g., Magazine Article, Blog/Podcast, Painting/Artwork), and follow the prompts to enter the publication details manually.

, The generator will come up with a list of possible alternatives that match the work you need to cite.


If you supply specific information (such as a URL or ISBN), this will be a short list.
If you enter less specific information (such as a keyword), you will get a longer list. Your source may or may not be included, depending on whether the generator located it. If your source is not on the list, then try supplying more specific information, or using the manual-fill entry mode.
If you enter a common book title, then you will see a list of options. Check the author and date to be sure you're choosing the right one. For example, the book title Nemesis will return a list of 20 different books, each written by a different author.

, The generator will provide a form with all the possible details you might need to supply for that type of work. The relevant information should be filled out for you, although you may need to fill in a few blank boxes yourself.Your references should always include title, author, publication date, publication location, and publisher. If any of these are missing, then you'll need to refer to the work itself to find that information.

, When you select “Create Citation,” the generator will format the reference for you in proper APA style.Copy and paste the generated citation if you want to add it to your references manually.
Continue to enter more works if you want the generator to compile an alphabetized reference list of all your references.

, If you choose to create multiple citations, most online generators will compile the complete list for you, and you can copy and paste it (or download it) when you are finished. However, it is a good idea to cut and paste them into a temporary list as you go, to prevent accidentally losing your work., When you have compiled your references, read through them to make sure there are no mistakes. The OWL Purdue Online Writing Lab has a comprehensive APA style guide, which you can check against your list to make sure everything looks correct.Check for misspellings or glaring omissions, such as missing dates or author names.
Check to be sure you have included every source you wanted to include.

Create your “References” page.,
Use hanging indentations.,
Alphabetize your sources.,
Order titles by the same author chronologically.,
Alphabetize group authors as you would single authors.,
Use the book title if there is no author name.",How to Write an APA Style Bibliography3," Your references page should be a new page after the last page of your paper. Type the word “References” on the first line of the page, and center it.Do not use bold, italics, or quotation marks on the word “References.”
Double space the entire “References” page.
Do not add an extra line between the title '”References” and your first reference item., When including references, indent all lines except the first line. The first line should be flush with your left margin. The second and subsequent lines of the citation entry should be indented ½ inch from your left margin.In your word processing program, you can apply hanging indentations to the entire list of references.


To set your indentations to hanging, open the “Paragraph” dialog box by clicking the small arrow to the right of “Paragraph” near the top of your MS Word document.
After the box opens, look for the section called “Indentation.”
Click on the drop down menu called “Special” that is in this section and select “Hanging.”
Your entries will now automatically have hanging indentations.

, Create an alphabetized list of your sources using the author’s last name. If the source you are using contains two or more authors, use the last name of the author listed first in the citation.Alphabetize letter by letter. Remember that “nothing precedes something,” or in other words, the shorter version of two similar names should come first. For example, Brown, J. R. would come before Browning, A. R.
Alphabetize the prefixes M', Mc, and Mac exactly as they are shown. Do not alphabetize them as if they were all spelled out (Mac).
Ignore apostrophes in names. For example, MacNeil would come before M'Carthy.

, If you have two or more works by the same author (or two authors with the same name), list the works chronologically with the earliest publication first and the most recently published last.List one-author entries before multiple-author entries, when the first author is the same. For example, “Alleyne, R. L. (2001).” would come before “Alleyne, R. L. & Evans, A. J. (1999).”

, Alphabetize group authors (or no authors) by the first significant word in the name. Use the full official name of the group or organization. A parent company or organization should be listed before its subsidiary group or organization.


For example, “American Society for the Prevention and Cruelty of Animals,” not “ASPCA”.
For example, “University of Michigan, Department of Psychology,” not “Department of Psychology, University of Michigan”.

, When there is no single author or group author listed for a publication, the title of the work moves up to the author position in the citation. Alphabetize these listings by the first significant word in the title.For example, “Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary (11th ed.). (2005) Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster.""

Keep a journal.",How to Improve Your Handwriting Style," Having the right instrument to write with will help you improve your handwriting. If the ink doesn’t come out easily, or if the pen leaves globs of ink on the paper, it will detract from your ability to write in a relaxed way. Find a pen with good ink flow. Also consider the size and shape of the pen, as well as the point of the pen.Slim pens may be harder to hold, causing your hand to cramp up more quickly. Thicker pens can offer a better grip, making it easier to write.
If you are left-handed, choose a pen with fast-drying ink so that the ink doesn’t smear as you write.;
, Paper is another essential part of creating good handwriting. Find lined paper with lines that are not too close together. Starting with wide-ruled paper can be a good idea. Alternately, start with grid-lined paper or kids’ handwriting paper, which has more lines on it. This will help you practice writing upper- and lower-case letters., Stack 3-4 sheets of paper to write on. If you keep the paper in the pad or notebook, the added height might make it more difficult to write smoothly. If you only have one piece of paper, you might feel the imperfections of your writing surface too acutely.

, Do some simple stretches to get your hands and arms warmed up to write. This will help prevent your hands from cramping up too quickly when you write.Wiggle and stretch your fingers around for a couple of minutes.
Make a fist and then stretch out your fingers, pushing the fingers upward to feel the stretch.
Stretch your wrists around, moving them in a circular motion.
Pretend you are playing a piano to get your arms moving sideways.
Roll your shoulders around several times.

, Sit at a desk in a straight-backed chair or comfortable desk chair. Sit with your feet flat on the floor. Rest the forearm of your writing hand on the table.Make sure you have plenty of space on the table or desk around you so that your arms don’t feel cramped for space. Clear coffee cups, old mail, books, and other items out of the way.
Many experts recommend writing on a surface that is at a 45 degree angle. This is impractical for many people, unless you have a drafting table or similar surface. A flat surface will be fine for improving your handwriting at this point., Having the paper sit directly in front of you is best, but make minor adjustments to ensure the most comfortable position for you. If you are right-handed, you might choose to rotate the paper slightly to the left. For a left-hander, position the paper at a 45 degree angle to the right. This will enable you to see what you’re writing.When you get near the bottom of the page as you are writing, move the paper upwards, rather than continuing to move your hand downward.

, Hold the pen with a firm grip, but don’t squeeze it tightly. Your hand will tire and cramp if your grip is too tight. Likewise, if it’s too loose, the pen will slip out of your hand periodically as you write.


Hold the pen between your index finger and your thumb, and rest it slightly on your middle finger. The top of the pen should rest on the base knuckle of your index finger. , Your fingers and hand should not move much when writing. They are most responsible for gripping the pen. Your arm and shoulder are the parts of your body that should control the pen’s movement. As you write, notice which part of your body moves: do your fingers move? Your wrist? Your arm or shoulder? Start concentrating on moving the arm and shoulder while holding the wrist and fingers stationary., Instead of writing on paper, bring your arm out in front of you and write letters in the air. Focus on using your arm and shoulder to write the letters, keeping your fingers and wrist stationary.Write the alphabet in the air, making printed letters and cursive letters. Make large letters, sweeping your arm to shape the letters. Gradually decrease the size of the letters.
Write on a vertical surface such as a chalkboard. To write effectively on a vertical surface, it’s nearly impossible to write with your fingers. Writing here will force you to use your arm and shoulder.

, Write circles, spirals, Xs, vertical lines and slanted lines. Try to get into a rhythm to write them consistently and uniformly. Remember to use your arm and shoulder to make the writing motion, rather than your hand.As you progress, add other shapes, such as Us and mounds, zigzags, and other shapes that are found in letters.As you practice these more, you will notice more consistency in the writing.
These can be practiced anytime, even during meetings or waiting for someone on the phone.

, Many people have become trained to write fast because they type fast. Keeping up with your thoughts can be difficult when you are handwriting, but slowing down the process will help you improve the quality of your handwriting. Form each letter slowly and deliberately, especially in the beginning.


If you think you will forget what you want to write, write out a rough draft and then rewrite it more slowly.

, In order to write your letters correctly, use a template to help you rethink how to write letters. Search online for handwriting templates or worksheets. Trace over the letters and then practice writing them yourself.Do this for both upper- and lower-case letters, and both printed and cursive letters.

, Certain letters are written with 1, 2 or 3 strokes of a pen. Practice pairs of these letters together to work into a rhythm of writing.


Letters with one stroke of a pen: L, V, U, W, Z, C, O, S
Letters with two strokes: B, D, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, T, X, Y, G
Letters with three strokes: A, E, F, H, I

, Make sure the height of any letter is correct in comparison with the other letters. All capital letters should be the same height. Most lower-case letters are about half the height of upper-case letters, although letters like “k,” “f,” or “d” can extend to the top of the top line., Letters should be certain widths relative to each other. As you practice your worksheets and write more, try to make the letters proportionate to each other, width-wise.

, There are about 220 words in the English language that are most frequently used in writing. These include words such as “the,” “and,” “is,” “was,” and so on. Search online for “Dolch list,” which is named after Edward Dolch, the creator of this list of words.Add some of your most frequently used words to the list. For example, add your name, the names of your family members, your town, and your address to the list. If you find that you write a lot about a particular topic, you might have other words to add as well.

, Don’t try to squeeze your letters into a small space. Particularly as you are working on improving your handwriting, allow yourself plenty of space on the paper to write the letters. Write them with a flourish, almost decoratively, so that you can get the flow and rhythm of writing by hand.

, Take a bit of time every day when you feel relaxed to practice your handwriting. Spend some time writing certain letter pairs or pangrams (sentences with all the letters).


An example of a pangram is: “A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Search online for other examples.

, Unless you need to, skip typing things out on the computer or on your phone. Handwrite reminder notes to yourself or family members, shopping lists, postcards, letters, envelopes, and so on.


If you need to fill out a form, you usually have the option of printing it and filling it out by hand. Filling out forms will help you practice your capital block letters., Writing in a journal is a good way to keep you writing every day. Just a few minutes can be helpful for improving your handwriting. Plus, there’s the added benefit of reducing stress that comes with journaling."

Cite a journal article.",How to Write in MLA Format," According to standard MLA formatting rules, a cover page, or separate title page, is not necessary and should not be added to most papers.


With that in mind, sometimes an instructor will ask students to create a cover page for an MLA style paper, especially for long papers. There are guidelines concerning the type of information that should be included in this event.;
, Your title should be centered and typed one-third of the way down from the top of the page.The title of your page should be informative yet creative.
If you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title.
The first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like “the,” “and,” or “to,” unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle.

, In the middle of the page, still centered, you should type your name proceeded by the word “By.”


Type “By” on one line, hit the “Enter” key on your keyboard, and type or full name on the following line.
Your name should be in FirstName LastName format.

, Two-thirds down from the top of the page, you should include this block of essential information about the assignment itself.


Type the class and section number on one line.
On the line immediately after, write the instructor's name.
On the final line, type the date your paper is due in Month Numerical Day, Numerical Year format.

, The top, bottom, left, and right margins should each be 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.


For most word processing programs, you can change the margins by heading into the ""Page Layout"" settings, usually located under a ""File"" menu. There should be a ""Margins"" heading in the dialog box. From there, change each margin to the appropriate size.

, From the first page on, your entire paper should be double-spaced. Note that you do not need to include any extra space at the end of a paragraph.


For most word processing programs, you can change the spacing by going into the “Page Layout” settings, typically accessed from a “File” menu.” There should be a “Line Spacing” heading in the dialog box. Under that heading, select “2.0” spacing.

, The preferred font and size for MLA papers is 12-point Times New Roman.


If you opt to use another font instead of Times New Roman, choose a font that is simple, easy to read, and not excessively large.

, A running header will appear on each page in the same spot. It should include your last name and the page number of each page, and should be positioned in the upper right corner of the page.


Access the ""Header and Footer"" tool in your word processor, often found under the ""View"" menu. Type your last name and hit the page number icon in the options box to automatically insert the current page number on its corresponding page.

, The heading essentially includes all the information a cover page would include when used. Type your full name, instructor's name, course name, and due date in the upper left corner.


Type your full name FirstName LastName on the first line.
On the next line, type your instructor's title and name.
On the third line, type the the class course number.
Include the date your assignment is due on the last line. It should be in Numerical Day Month Numerical Year format.

, On the line immediately following the date, you should type your paper's title. This title should be centered.


Do not make the title larger, italicized, underlined, or bold printed.
The title of your page should be informative yet creative.
If you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title.
The first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like “the,” “and,” or “to,” unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle.

, On the line immediately following the title, left-align your text and begin writing the introduction paragraph of your paper.

, The first line of each paragraph must be indented by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


Indent the first line by hitting to “Tab” key on your keyboard.
You do not need to separate paragraphs with extra line spacing. This indentation alone is enough to mark the start of a new paragraph.

, If your paper is long, your instructor may request that you separate certain portions of it into various section headings.


The recommendation for section headings under the MLA style is to number each section with an Arabic number and a period. Follow the period with a space before typing the section name.The first letter of each word in the section name should be capitalized.
Section headings should usually be centered on the page and given their own separate lines.

, When you include a table or figure in your MLA paper, center the figure and provide a figure number, label, and source information.


Use ""Fig. 1,"" ""Fig. 2,"" etc. for illustrations and photographs. Use ""Table 1,"" ""Table 2,"" etc. for tables and charts.
Quickly label the figure with a descriptive term like ""cartoon"" or ""statistical table.""
Provide the creator's name, the source the figure was published in, the date of publication, and the page number.
All of the information should be included on a single line below the picture.

, Whenever you include a direct quote, paraphrase, or summary in your paper, you must cite the source of that material in parentheses after the material is presented.


When the information is available, include the author's last name and the page number from which the material came.
If the materials came from an online source and no page number is available, you only need to include the author's name.
If no author's name is available, include an abbreviated portion of the source material's title.
Note that if you introduce the author's name earlier in the sentence, you do not need to include the name in the parentheses, as well.

, Most quotations will be “in-line,” meaning that no special formatting is required and they can be treated as normal text.


Always include a quote as part of another sentence. Never write a “hanging quote,” a type of quotation in which only the quote is presented without any lead in.
Commas and periods should follow the parenthetical citation, and the parentheses should fall outside of the ending quotation marks.

, Quotes that are longer than three lines should be separated from the rest of the text in the form of a block quote.After you type the last word that comes before your quote, hit the ""Enter"" key to move to a new line.
Each line of a block quote should be indented another 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in.
You do not need to include quotation marks for a block quote, but you still need to include a parenthetical citation.

, Do not italicize, bold, or underline this heading.If you inserted any notes into your document, the notes themselves should be included as endnotes that are listed on a separate page after the main body of the paper. Do not include them as footnotes, which are listed at the foot of each page as they appear.

, If you inserted your endnotes using an endnote tool on your word processor, the numbering should already be done for you.


Otherwise, make sure that each endnote is proceeded by an Arabic number that corresponds to a number places in the section of the paper's body that relates to the information provided by the endnote.
The first line of each endnote should be indented by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, Endnotes should be used to discuss information that does not coherently fit into the paragraph it relates to.


Your endnotes should not exceed three or four lines in lengths. Avoid long discussions. Endnotes are not the right time to bring up entirely new points.

, Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading.


If including multiple appendices, label each as “Appendix A,” “Appendix B,” and so on.

, The information in an appendix should relate to the information in your paper, but it should not be crucial or essential to your argument.


An appendix is a way to include related information without distracting from the main argument of your paper.

, Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading.


Your “Works Cited” page should include all the texts you directly referenced in the body of your paper.
All papers written in MLA format must include a “Works Cited” page.

, All of your citations should be listed in alphabetical order according to the authors' last names.


If a text does not have a known author, arrange that citation in alphabetical order according to the first word of the article or book title.

,


Write the author's name in LastName, Firstname"" format. Follow with a period.

Italicize the book title and capitalize the first letter of each word. Follow with a period.
Write the city of publication followed by a colon, and include the publisher's name after that. Follow this with a comma and the year of publication. End with a period.

Collect all data of the cited materials.,
Review appropriate styles.,
Format your Works Cited page.,
Review the course syllabus, if your works cited page is for an academic course.",How to Write a Works Cited Page1," Every published work that you cite in your paper needs to appear in your Works Cited list. When pulling material during your research, take note of all of the important data so that you can accurately fill out your Works Cited page:


Author(s)
Title
Published date
Publisher
Publisher location
Medium (Print, web, film, DVD, etc.)
Page numbers/Act, or section and line numbers;
, There are three major styles that you may be asked to use when creating your Works Cited page. The most common is MLA (Modern Languages Association), which is used in liberal arts and humanities. Also used are Chicago (for publishing) and APA (for sciences).


Chicago Manual of Style refers to the Works Cited page as a Reference page using the author-date system.
There is a difference between a bibliography and a Works Cited page. A bibliography includes any sources that you used while researching and preparing your paper, even if you don’t reference them in your writing. A Works Cited page only includes sources that are directly referenced., According to MLA guidelines, a Works Cited page should be formatted with the following rules:


One-inch margins all around.
Label the page “Works Cited”, and center it on the top line.
All citations should be double-spaced, with no extra lines between entries.
Indent all lines after the first of an entry by 0.5 inches (1.3 cm).

, Most academic instructors include a paper syllabus at the beginning of a course. The syllabus lists most of the assignments and may provide helpful information about how to comply with specific rules from a program or professor.


Not all instructors in the arts follow MLA guidelines for formatting, so make sure that you know how your instructor would like the Works Cited page formatted.

"
Include the author’s last name for in-text citations.,
Cite the name of the corporation as the author’s name.,
Cite the article’s title if the source does not have a given author.,
Include information about the edition when you cite classic literary works.,
Include first initials when you cite two (or more) authors with the same last name.,
Cite sources with three or more authors.,
Include “et al” in citations with three or more authors.,
Cite multiple works with the same author.,
Cite multivolume works.,
Cite the Bible.,
Use “qtd” when citing indirect sources.,
Cite internet sources.",How to Use Internal Citations1," Print sources include magazines, books, newspapers, and scholarly journal articles. When citing these kinds of sources that have a known author, cite the author’s last name and a page number. If you use the author’s last name within the text, you don’t need to repeat it in the citation; just include the page number within the parentheses.Example of a citation with name in the text: “Smith stated that the findings in his experiment were surprising (Smith 30).”
Example of a citation without name in the text: “The findings in this experiment can be described as surprising (30).”;
, Some sources have a corporate author (the individual writer is not specified)—in these instances, simply use the name of the corporation as the author’s name. In cases in which the corporation has a long or complicated name, use its abbreviation to make for more fluid reading., Follow this with the page number the passage was taken from. This is common for smaller website pages, which often do not list an individual author. (For long titles, instead of using the title in its entirety, use a condensed version.)If the source is a short work—like a journal article, book chapter, or poem—put the title in quotations when citing.
If the source is a long work—like a book, play, or even a television show—italicize the title.

, Well-known literary works—especially those written before the 20th century—will have multiple published editions. In order to avoid confusion between the different editions, in addition to providing the author and page number in your in-text citation, provide more information about the source such as the volume (vol.), chapter (ch.), book (bk.), part (pt.), or section (sec.) number. Use a semicolon to separate these from the page number.In-text citation: “Smith and Jones conducted the experiment with the help of their colleagues (30; vol. 2).”
Parenthetical citation: “The results of the experiment were inconclusive (Smith 30; vol. 2).”

, If you find that two or more authors within a source share the same last name, use their first initials for differentiation. If two or more authors share both the same last name and first initial, use their full names.In-text citation: “Some scientists believe the results of the experiment were inconclusive (A. Smith 13), while others found them to be quite grounded in research (B. Smith 30).”
Parenthetical citation: “Scientists conducting this experiment had differing views on the evidence, some believing the results to be inconclusive and others finding them grounded and quite conclusive (Alex Smith 13; Adam Smith 30).”

, If citing a source with three authors or more, include the author’s last names plus the page number the passage was found on.In-text citation: “Smith, Jones, and White suggest that the results to the experiment were inconclusive (30).”
Parenthetical citation: “The authors state, ‘Significant evidence suggests that the results to the experiment were inconclusive (Smith, Jones, and White 30).’ ”

, If your source contains more than three authors, you have two options for proper referencing. You may use just the first author’s last name, followed by “et al.” (This is a common Latin phrase which means “and others”), or you may use all of the authors’ last names in your citation. In cited works with a longer list of authors, consider using the “et al.” option.In-text citation using et al.: “Jones et al. counter Johnson and White's argument (30).”
In-text citation using all last names: “Jones, Smith, White, and Johnson counter Jackson, McMahon, and Kent’s argument (30).”
Parenthetical citation using et al.: Legal experts counter Smith, Jones, and White's argument by noting that the current evidence suggests otherwise (Marks et al. 4).
Parenthetical citation using all last names: Legal experts counter Smith, Jones, and White's argument by noting that the current evidence suggests otherwise (Marks et al. 4).

, When referencing several sources with the same author, cite the work using a condensed version of the title followed by the page number.When citing articles and other shorter works, use quotation marks.
When citing books and other longer works, italicize the title.

, Some sources have multiple volumes. When referencing different volumes of one particular source, be sure to include the volume number along with a page number and separate the two with a colon. When citing just one volume within a multivolume source, just the page number should be provided in parentheses.Example of citation: “…as Smith wrote in Experimental Thesis (1: 30-31).”

, There are many common translations of the Bible, including the King James Version, English Standard Version, and New International Version. As such, you want to distinctly identity which Bible translation you are referencing and then be sure to name the book, chapter, and verse within your citation.When stating the version of the Bible, italicize or underline the title.
When stating the specific book from the Bible you are referencing, do not italicize or underline its title.
Example of citation: Ezekiel saw “what seemed to be four living creatures,” each with faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle (King James Holy Bible, Ezek. 1.5-10).

, Indirect sources are secondary sources that are already referenced within a source. When citing this type of source write “qtd.” before the name of the source, followed by the page number. For example: “… (qtd. in Smith 230)…”, For sources found electronically, page and paragraph numbers may not exist; you do not need to include them within your citation. Simply cite the name of the article, film, or website when citing an internet source."

Cite two or more poems by the same author.",How to Quote and Cite a Poem in an Essay Using MLA Format," Any time you borrow information from another source, you must indicate this in your paper, otherwise it's plagiarism. Use quotation marks (""Quote"") around the words that you take verbatim (word for word) from another source with an in-text citation in parenthesis at the end (more on this in Part 2). Paraphrases (summarizing in your own words) don't require quote marks, but they still need an in-text citation at the end of the borrowed idea.


If you don't take these steps correctly, then you aren't giving credit where it's due to the original author and your teacher may consider this plagiarism.;
, Do not underline or italicize them.


Example sentence: Robert Frost’s poem, “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” discusses the idea of solitude versus living in a world of other people and obligations.

, Insert a slash with a space on each side to separate the lines of the poem. Type the lines verbatim as they appear in the poem--do not paraphrase.Capitalize the first letter of each new line of poetry.


Here is an example of several lines of poetry from Robert Frost’s “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening”:
The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
Here is an example of how to insert several lines of poetry into an essay: In ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"" Frost writes, “The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, / But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep.""

, These quotations should be indented 1 inch (2.5 cm) or 10 spaces from the left margin. Do not add quotation marks for a long quote. Add the line numbers inside parentheses right after the closing punctuation of the quotation. Do not put another comma after the in-text citation. Use a colon after a complete sentence that introduces a quotation to avoid a comma splice.


Example: Robert Frost writes about solitude and man’s relationship with nature:
                    Whose woods these are I think I know.
                    His house is in the village, though;
                    He will not see me stopping here
                    To watch his woods fill up with snow. (1-4)

, Use an ellipsis when you have a long quotation that needs shortening or when you need to leave out material that is not relevant to the point you are making.Example: Robert Frost discusses solitude and a desire to forget obligations when he writes, “The woods are lovely...but I have promises to keep” (13-14).
If an ellipsis covers a line break, do not worry about including a backslash inside the ellipsis, as in the above example. But if you continue on without an ellipsis, include the backslashes that indicate line breaks.

Example: Robert Frost discusses solitude and a desire to forget obligations when he writes, ""The woods are lovely...but I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep"" (13-15).



, Again, delete lines that are not relevant to the point you are making. Make the line of ellipses approximately as long as the lines of poetry to keep the symmetry of the poem.Example: Robert Frost discusses solitude when he writes,
                    Whose woods these are I think I know.
                    ………………………………………….
                    He will not see me stopping here
                    To watch his woods fill up with snow. (1-4)

, Add the line numbers, if provided, in parentheses right after the closing quotation marks. Place the closing punctuation after the parentheses. You do not need to put the author’s name or the name of the poem in the parentheses if you include the author's name in your introduction to the quote (eg Robert Frost writes about...). However, if you do not include the author's name in your quote introduction (eg Some poets write about...), then you need to include it in the in-text parenthetical citation before the line numbers with only a space in between the two--no comma!Example: In ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"" Frost writes, “The woods are lovely, dark, and deep / But I have promises to keep / And miles to go before I sleep” (13-15).
Example: The notion of solitude appears in many notable poems including the famous lines, ""The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, / But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep"" (Frost 13-15).

, Add a line number at the end of your sentence when you only quote one word.


Example of one quoted word: Robert Frost uses the word “sleep” to imply fantasies about solitude and perhaps death (15).
Example of multiple words: Robert Frost uses a variety of words and phrases such as “frozen” (7), “darkest evening” (8), and “before I sleep” (15) to imply thoughts of solitude and the desire to not return to his obligations.
Just make sure that you include the proper line numbers, whatever the form. If you are citing a longer section of the poem, you will include more line numbers (12-32). If you cite two separate sections using an ellipsis, indicate the range of the sections with a comma separating them (11-15, 18-21).

, In MLA format, any quote over three lines is considered a long quote and should be formatted and cited differently. As previously mentioned, long quotes are indented 1 inch or 10 spaces from the left margin and aren't surrounded by quotation marks. Because there are no quotation marks for a long quote, the punctuation goes at the end of the quoted material, not after the citation, whereas the punctuation appears after the in-text citation for a short quote.


Example of citing a short quote: In ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"" Frost writes, “The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, / But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep” (13-15).
Example of citing a long quote: Robert Frost writes about solitude and man’s relationship with nature:
                    Whose woods these are I think I know.
                    His house is in the village, though;
                    He will not see me stopping here
                    To watch his woods fill up with snow. (1-4)

, If you're using two or more poems by the same author, then just using the author's last name isn't a clear enough indication for the in-text citation for which poem you're discussing or quoting from. In this case, put the author's last name, a comma, the poem title (or a shortened version) in quotes, a space, and then the line numbers from the poem.


Example: The notion of solitude appears in many notable poems including the famous lines, ""The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, / But I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep"" (Frost, ""Stopping by the Woods"" 13-15). This idea is mirrored in the lines ""And both that morning equally lay / In leaves no step had trodden black"" (Frost, ""The Road Not Taken"" 11-12).

, List: the author’s Lastname, Firstname. “Title of Poem.” Title of Book. City of publication: Publisher, year. Page number range. Publication medium (Print.)

, If you have two or more poems by the same author, list them alphabetically on your Works Cited page. The first entry (alphabetically) will appear normally, but the second (and any other subsequent entries by the same author) entry will have three dashes (-) instead of the author's name.This indicates that the author listed is the same as the previous entry.

Practice whenever you can.",How to Have Better Handwriting," Spending a few minutes stretching will help your muscles used for writing become stronger and more flexible. This will help prevent your hand from cramping or tiring out quickly. You will want to focus these stretching exercises on the hand you write with, but your non-writing hand can help out too. Here are some possible stretches:


Wiggle and stretch your fingers using both hands.
Match your hands up (like you're giving yourself a high five), and push your fingers against each other.
Interlace your fingers and push your hands out in front of your body.
Alternate between making a tight fist, and then opening your hand wide to stretch your muscles.
Flex and reach to touch each of your fingers to your thumb. Try to coordinate each touch with the beat of a song.
Roll your wrist around in circular motions. You can also flex your wrist back and forth.
Roll your shoulders in forward circular movements and backward circular movements.;
, Before you start practicing your handwriting, you will want materials that will help with your practice.Some helpful materials include:


A table or a hard surface to write on. Having a smooth, hard surface to write on will immediately increase the readability and clarity of your handwriting.
A lined notebook or lined paper. This will help keep track of the size of your letters.
A writing utensil. Some people debate over which is better to use for handwriting: a pen or a pencil. A pen can sometimes write smoother because of the free flowing ink, but a pencil but might better for someone looking to work on technique and correct mistakes. Either way, pick a writing utensil that is comfortable to hold in your hand.

, Many teachers would say that having proper posture is a must for having legible handwriting. Having proper posture constitutes as sitting up straight with your shoulders pushed back, and sitting with your legs uncrossed, and feet on the floor.Usually, a chair with a high, flat back is suggested for added back support. While practicing proper posture might be helpful in terms of writing in a balanced seated position, and relieving some tension on your back, it is not something you should get hung-up on. Sit in a comfortable position that gives your arm and hand enough room to move freely as you write.

, Everyone holds their writing utensil differently, but a common way of holding a pen or pencil is gripping it between your thumb, index finger, and middle finger, while resting the middle part of the pen on either the index finger knuckle, or in the webbed part of your hand between the thumb and index finger.You want to grip the pen with enough pressure that it won't slip from your hand while writing, but gentle enough that your hand isn't shaking and cramping within minutes.


For people who write with their left hand, it may help to write with your hand hooked, creating a mountain shape between the forearm and thumb of your hand. It may also help to hold the pen a little bit higher up, so you can see what you are writing.

, Most people write using their fingers to create the shape of their letters. This is called finger-writing. Using only your fingers to draw out the letters can put a lot of strain on your finger muscles, causing your hand to tire and cramp more quickly. An alternate and less strenuous way to write, is relying on your shoulder and arm muscles to do the work instead of your finger muscles. You will know if you're using these muscles correctly if your forearm and shoulder move as you write. Some people who write or draw for their profession (calligraphers, architectural drafters, etc.) have found it easier and more precise to write and draw using their shoulder muscles. Using your forearm and shoulder muscles to write are beneficial because surprisingly, these muscles are capable of fine, intricate motor movements, and also tire out a lot less easily than your finger muscles.Here's how to teach yourself to write using your shoulder and forearm muscles:



Write big air letters. Writing in the air simulates the same movements you would use to write on paper using your shoulder and forearm muscles. It's just like writing on a blackboard. Remember that your forearm should guide the shaping of the letters, while your shoulder should provide the power.Once you get comfortable with the shoulder and forearm movements, make the size of the letters you are drawing out smaller and smaller.Then, once you feel you are ready, practice with pen and paper.
Concentrate on keeping your fingers, hand, and wrist steady while your forearm and shoulder provide the movements.



, Doodling is a simple way to practice making writing movements with your shoulder and forearm muscles without having to construct precise letters. You can doodle some shapes and symbols used in the alphabet to get move comfortable with curves and angles. Common alphabet shapes you can practice are /////s, \\\\\s, +++++s, and OOOOOs.You can also practice waves and zig-zags for other letters of the alphabet., It is easiest to begin with the individual letters of the alphabet before moving on to more complicated words and sentences. Begin by writing the alphabet in all uppercase letters and all lowercase letters. Then, you can start writing the individual letters both uppercase and lowercase, together (for example, Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd, Ee, Ff, etc).

, Practicing writing the alphabet letters in small groups can help you conquer writing out similar letters in smaller portions. By focusing on groups of letters that have similar shape, stroke count, and structure, you can solidify the the movements necessary to write out those letters.All uppercase letters should be the same height. The uppercase letters of the alphabet can be divided into these smaller groups:


Uppercase letters made using one stroke of the pen.L,V,U,W,Z,C,O,S


Uppercase letters made using two strokes of the pen.B,D,J,K,M,N,PQ,R,X,T,Y,Z


Uppercase letters made using three strokes of the pen.A,E,F,H,I



, While uppercase letters should all be the same height, lowercase letters should vary in height.For example the letters in group 1 should be smaller than the letters in group 4, since the letters in group 1 are all rounded letter whereas the letters in group 4 have have longer tails and stems.


Lowercase letters - group 1.m,n,r,u


Lowercase letters - group 2.a,c,e,s,o


Lowercase letters - group 3.b,d,h,j,g,p,q,f,y


Lowercase letters - group 4.v,w,x,z



, Everybody has their own style of handwriting, but there are certain sequences when writing out the letters that make it easier to move on to the next letter. For example, rather than starting a lowercase 'e' with the bottom tail and bringing your pen up and around, begin with the short line in the middle of the letter, and bring the pen out, up, around, and down, so you can move to the next letter naturally.


Handwriting notebooks usually consist of writing spaces that are lined in different ways to help with letter sizing and proportion. Repetitive practice writing out letters and sentences can make your handwriting neater and easier to read.

, Maybe you noticed your handwriting looks a lot better when your letters are more curvy and loopy. Maybe it's easier for you to write comfortably when your letters are bigger than your usual handwriting. Whatever it may be, practice writing with different styles like loopy, bubbly letters, angled, sharp letters, or narrow, tall letters to see what is easiest for you to write and for others to read. There are a million ways to write your letters, experiment to find what works best for you.

, If you just received a birthday card from your uncle, and you really like the way he writes his J's and c's, get some tracing paper, place it on top of his writing, and trace away. This will help with recognizing and imitating different elements that you want to incorporate into your own writing.

, As you progress to writing words and sentences, writing slowly will help you identify areas of your writing that need improvement, such as letter spacing, word spacing, letter size, and slant. By taking your time, you can focus on making your letters uniform and sharp.

, Write out your to-do list or grocery list by hand. Doodle while you're on the phone. Keep a journal and write about your day. The more you practice, the better you will become.

Use both authors’ last names when citing a work with two authors.,
Name each author the first time you cite a source with three to five authors.,
Cite sources with six or more authors.,
Include the source’s title when the source’s author is unknown.,
Cite organizations as an author.,
Use a semicolon to separate two or more sources that are cited within the same parentheses.,
Include authors’ first initials to avoid confusion between two cited authors with the same last name.,
Cite two or more sources with the same author and year.,
Cite introductions, prefaces, forewords, and afterwords.,
Include name and date when you cite personal information.,
Use “qtd” to indicate an indirect source in a citation.,
Cite electronic sources like any other kind of source, using the author-date approach to referencing.",How to Use Internal Citations2," When referencing a source with two authors, be sure to use both last names within one single phrase. When citing within the text, the names are joined with the word “and,” followed by the date of publication in parentheses. For parenthetical citation, use an ampersand, followed by a comma and the year of publication, all within parentheses.As in MLA, the parenthetical citation should appear after the sentence has ended, but prior to the period. For example, “(Smith & Jones, 2001).”


Name both authors every time you cite this source.
An example in-text citation would look like this: “Information gathered by Smith and Jones (2006) indicated that….”
Parenthetical citation would look like this: “ … (Smith & Jones, 2006).”

, APA style requires you to name each author within a single phrase only the first time you cite this source. Join the authors’ names with an “and” within the text and with an ampersand for parenthetical citation. For successive citations, just use the first author’s last name and “et al.”In-text citation for the initial reference: “…Smith, Jones, White, Johnson, and McMahon (2006).”
Parenthetical citation for the initial reference: “(Smith, Jones, White, Johnson, & McMahon, 2006).”
Subsequent referencing for in-text citation: “Information gathered by Smith, et al. (2006).”
Subsequent referencing for parenthetical citation: “(Smith et al., 1993)”

, When referencing sources with six authors or more, use the first author’s last name only for both parenthetical and in-text citations, followed by “et al.” In-text citation: “Smith et al. (2006) stated…”
Parenthetical citation: “(Smith et al., 2006)”

, Sometimes a source has no author or the author cannot be found. When this is the case, use the source’s title; if the title is lengthy, you can shorten it and include only the first word or two within the parentheses.Cite sources with unknown author. As with MLA style, use the article’s title (or a shortened version of the title) in place of an author’s name: “The experiment yielded multiple results (“Learning Theory,” 2006).”
Titles of web pages, articles, and chapters are cited using quotation marks.
Titles of reports and books are italicized.

, As in MLA style, if your source is a government agency or an organization, use the entire name during your initial citation. If the name has an abbreviation, indicate it within brackets the first time citing this source. For subsequent citations, only use the abbreviation.First citation: (Public Action to Deliver Shelter , 2006)
Second citation: (P.A.D.S., 2006)

, There are times when you may need to reference two or more sources within one parenthetical in-text citation. When doing this, separate the two sources using a semicolon, then the sources in alphabetical order by author’s last name. Your citation would look like this, (Smith, 2006; Jones, 2008)., At times you may run into two authors with the same name. When this occurs, simply avoid any uncertainties by using first initials along with the last names of both cited authors. Your citation would like this, (A. Smith, 2005; B. Jones, 2008)., When using two or more sources published in the same year and authored by the same person, simply use lower case letters, alphabetically, after the year of publication to distinguish them. For example:


“Discovered by Smith (2006a) during his experimental testing….”, Treat in-text citations for introductions, prefaces, forewords, and afterwords like you would a simple author-date citation. Your citation would look like this, (Smith & Jones, 2005)., Personal communication includes information gathered from interviews, e-mails, letters, and any other type of person-to-person communication. To reference any of these sources, include the communicator’s name, the date of communication, and identify this source as “personal communication.”In-text citation: Smith stated that he conducted the experiment with the help of colleagues (personal communication, December 2, 2005).
Parenthetical citation: “(Smith, personal communication, December 2, 2005).”

, Indirect sources are also called “secondary sources”; these are sources that are already cited by another source. The information from an indirect source is not the original source from which the information was initially collected. To cite this kind of source, use the original source in your single phrase and use the secondary source in parenthesis. Your citation would look like this: Smith proved within his experiment that….(as cited in Jones, 2006, p. 30). , Your citation should look like this, Smith (2006) stated… If you come across an electronic source with no author or date provided, use the entire title or the first word or two of the title, plus “n.d.” to denote “no date”.
For electronic sources without page numbers, try to incorporate as much information as possible that would help the reader find the text being referenced.

Group together multiple citations.",How to Reference in Numeric Style1," Numerical citations should be placed in sequence throughout the paper, starting with “1”. The citations should go directly after a mention of a source (e.g. “In his final publication, Foucault (16) claimed that…”) Format your numerical citations in round brackets, square brackets, or superscript.When referring to indirectly to a source, place the number at the end of your sentence. For instance, “Gender is a social construct perpetuated by social norms (3).”;
, Indicate direct quotes from a source clearly, with quotations marks. If you are inserting a long quote (more than four sentences) into your text, indent the block quotation. Avoid using overly long quotes unless they are directly pertinent to your paper.E.g., “McLuhan wrote, “the medium is the message” (12)…”.

, Add a page number to the in-text portion of your numeric citation if you’ve borrowed content from a specific part of a document. This may include using a table, picture, or diagram from a source, or borrowing a concept or argument specific to a certain part of a document. To reference multiple pages, use the abbreviation “pp.” instead of “p.”.If the page numbers are listed in roman numerals, do not include the abbreviation “p.” or “pp.” in front of them.

, Do not use more than one number for the same document. If you cite the same source more than once in a paper, re-use the number that you used initially. If you are referencing a different part of the text, indicate a page numbers or a section number., If you cite more than one source in the same sentence, there are two options for how to format it. Group the citation numbers together by placing the numbers in the same set of brackets, separated by commas. Alternatively, present each citation number in its own set of bracket, and separate these individual citations with commas.For instance, write either “""Several recent studies have suggested that..."" or “Several recent studies , , have suggested that..."".
If you are using superscript for your numeric citations, place the citation numbers together, separated by commas."

Understand how paraphrasing is used.,
Understand when to use paraphrasing instead of quoting.",How to Paraphrase Quoted Material1," Paraphrasing is when you read and absorb a quote and then restate its main ideas in your own words. When you paraphrase, you don't have to echo the sentences in your own words exactly, but you do have present the essential information and points made by an author with new phrasing. When you paraphrase, you should slightly condense the quote to cut down on any verbiage and get to the main idea.
An accurate paraphrase should be different enough from the original material to not be plagiarism. Even if you're citing the source, if you're not citing it in quotes but your ""own words"" are very close to the original, that is still plagiarism.
Paraphrasing is different from a summary, which is more broad and focuses on the main points of an entire text. Paraphrasing focuses on one main idea or concept at a time.
Paraphrasing is also a great way to avoid quoting from sources too much and not expressing your own thoughts in the paper.
When you paraphrase, you gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of the passage you're quoting, so you're gaining knowledge just by paraphrasing.;
, Quoting directly from a source is important when the way the words are used is important. For example, if you were quoting Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream Speech,"" it would be best to quote it directly, because the way he uses the words in the speech is particularly eloquent and poetic. But if you read something about racism in a dry textbook, then the ideas in the book are important, but not the words, and you should paraphrase them.


Paraphrasing is useful when the quote contains data, facts, or statistics. There's no need to quote a source directly just to show the importance of the data.
Quoting is useful if you're citing the words of a political figure, celebrity, or writer, and making a point about the way that language is used.
If you're close-reading a text for its use of language, then quoting is best; if you're discussing a paragraph or longer passage of a novel, then paraphrasing or summarizing is more useful.

Add the heading “References” to this list., If a source has multiple authors, list all of them in the full citation. Write each other’s family name, then the initial of their first name separated by a comma. The word and should be included before the final author’s name. List authors in the same order that they are listed on the publication., For the sake of precision, reference specific parts of websites instead of just the general homepage.

Read the original quote.,
Take notes.,
Rewrite the original quote in your words.,
Compare the original quote to your paraphrase.",How to Paraphrase Quoted Material2," First, carefully read the quote that you've chosen to paraphrase. It should be no more than a two or three sentences long. Take the time to really absorb its meaning and reach a deep understanding of what it means before you move on.

, As you keep reading the quote, jot down the main ideas in the quote. You can write down the main argument, and a few key words that help illustrate the argument. When you're done taking notes, put the original quote away.

, Using your notes and your knowledge of the quote, write the original quote in your own words. Take care to not only mix up the language but the sentence structure, so you're not just substituting different words and keeping the same structure.


If you're stuck with finding a different way to say something, use a thesaurus for help. Just make sure you're comfortable with the words you find and don't end up using words that are not quite the same as their counterparts. This would change the meaning of your statement.

, Once you've rewritten the passage in your own words, read it aloud, and then go back to the original quote and read it side-by-side with your new passage. You should make sure that two things are true:


The words in your passage and the structure of your sentences should be different enough that you would not be accused of plagiarizing. It should sound like you, not the author.
Your words should still clearly convey the main ideas in the original passage. You shouldn't change your paraphrase so much that you've lost the intended meaning.

Example of an original passage:""These days, too many high school students spend all of their time cramming for standardized tests that don't teach them anything. They would not only gain more knowledge if they spent more time learning the school curriculum instead of studying for tests, but they would also become more open-minded human beings.""

Example of a paraphrase: ""High school students are so obsessed with studying for SATs and other standardized tests that they don't have time to process the material they learn in their school courses. Studying for standardized tests not only offers them little real knowledge, but it keeps them from being broad-minded individuals.""

Don't take graphology too seriously.,
Get a good sample.,
Look at the pressure of the strokes.,
Check the slant of the strokes.,
Look at the baseline.,
Look at the size of the letters.,
Compare the spacing between letters and words.,
Watch how the writer strings letters together.",How to Analyze Handwriting (Graphology)1," Graphologists claim to find traces of personality in handwriting. There's probably a grain of truth in this — we can all imagine what ""energetic"" or ""careless"" handwriting looks like, for instance. However, since these claims have failed every scientific test, scientists consider graphology pseudoscientific and ineffective.At best these correlations are informed guesses with many exceptions. They're fun to find, but don't use them to judge job applicants or alter friendships.


Never trust anyone who claims they can tell a criminal or adulterer from the handwriting. This is not possible, and the accusations cause unjustified harm to their victims.;
, If possible, ask for a cursive writing sample on unlined paper. This tends to be easier to analyze than printed words or lined paper. Even better, get several handwriting samples at least a few hours apart. Handwriting changes with mood and circumstance, so a feature in one sample could just be a temporary artifact.

, Some people press hard into the paper, while others use a light touch. You can see this by how dark the writing turned out, and by pressure marks on the backside of the paper. Here's what graphologists say this means:High pressure means high emotional energy. The writer may be intense, sensual, or vigorous.
Average pressure means a relatively calm but anchored person. They might have good perception or memory skills.
Light pressure is a sign of introversion, or someone who prefers low-energy situations.

, Writing, especially cursive writing, tends to slant to the left or right. Try analyzing it like this, paying special attention to cursive letters with upper loops (such as b, d, or h):


A right slant shows up when the writer is eager to write, or writing quickly and energetically. If this happens often, the writer might be assertive and confident.
A left slant could mean an unwillingness to write, or a desire to hide emotions. Some say these writers are less cooperative than people who slant to the right.A straight vertical slant might mean the writer keeps her emotions in check.Note —This may not apply to left-handed people.

, When writing on unlined paper, people tend not to write in a perfect straight line. Put a ruler down straight across the paper, and compare it to the angle of the sentences:Upward writing is said to show optimism and a happy mood.
Downward writing may be a sign of discouragement or fatigue.
Wavy writing that moves up and down could mean an unstable or uncertain person, or an unskilled writer.

, Large letters mean the person is outgoing and extroverted. Small letters mean the person is reclusive, introverted, or thrifty.

, Does your friend cram letters close together? If so, he could be self conscious or introverted. If he drags the letters out, he might be generous and independent.Graphologists also like to look at gaps between words; the closer they are, the more the writer enjoys crowds.Others take a different approach and claim that more spacing between words shows clearer, more organized thought., Connections between cursive letters is a rich source of analysis, since there are so many possible variations. Graphologists rarely agree on these, but here are a few common interpretations:Garlands: these curves are cup-shaped, open at the top. It may show people strength and warmth.
Arcades: downward-facing curves are slower and more dignified, but also associated with creative types.
Threads: the pen stroke becomes lighter and lighter at the end of a word, sometimes trailing dots on the page. It's usually a rushed and sloppy style, though there are other variations.

Find the right pen.,
Take your time.,
Practice good posture.,
Try air writing.,
Don't press too hard.,
Practice daily.",How to Change Your Handwriting1," The right pen will be different for each person, but in general, you should look for one that flows well and that you won't grip too tightly. Larger grips can help you loosen your grip., Good handwriting takes time, and if you rush through it, your writing will be sloppy. If you catch yourself being sloppy, take a deep breath, slow down, and start again., Sit up at a table with your back and arm straight. Don't grip the pen or pencil too hard, as that can make your hand cramp., This method teaches you to write with your arm instead of drawing the letters with your finger, making for better writing.Holding your hand in the air, mostly use your forearm and shoulder to write large letters in the air. This practice will help you feel what muscles you should be using when you write.
Move to smaller letters in the air.
Use paper. When you first move to paper, try simple strokes like circles and slashes. Keep them as evenly spaced as possible, while still using the muscles in your arm., Pressing too hard can lead to crooked letters. Instead, lift up a bit and let the letters flow smoothly., Take some time each day to actually use your handwriting.One easy way to get your practice in is to keep a daily journal. Write about what happens in your day or what you're feeling."

In spite of any special circumstances, most MLA in-text citations are “straightforward and simple to remember” (“MLA Citations” 3).
In “MLA Citations,” the author notes that most MLA in-text citations are “straightforward and simple to remember” (3).

, If multiple authors wrote an article or book, the last name of each author should be included in the citation. This is only true if there are two or three authors for a work, however.

Smith and Hoffman insist that “most academic writers get used to the MLA style guide once they have used it a few times” (62).
Some students can balance knowing multiple style guides while others find it difficult to remember the specifics of each one (Johnson, Smith, and Doe 102).

, If more than three authors wrote an article or book, only the last name of the first author listed on the work should be included in the citation. The rest should be indicated with the abbreviation “et al.”

The MLA, APA, and Chicago style guides all share similarities, but each one also has its differences (Doe, et al. 44).
As noted by Doe, et al., the MLA, APA, and Chicago style guides all share similarities, but each one also has its differences (44).

, If you are citing a work that has been republished multiple times as multiple editions, you should consider noting the chapter, part, section, paragraph, volume, or book that the cited information came from in order to make it easier to find the same quote or paraphrase in a different edition.

From Austen's perspective, “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife” (4; ch. 1).
In the first chapter of Pride and Prejudice, Austen states, “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife” (4).

, If you are citing two separate works from two separate authors, but the authors happen to share the same last name, you need to distinguish that the two authors are separate people by including the first initial for each one.

Some believe that MLA citations are the most practical (J. Doe 17) while others believe that APA is a superior style guide (B. Doe 9).
J. Doe believes that MLA citations are the most practical (17) but B. Doe argues that APA is a superior style guide (9).

, If you are citing two works that were written by the same author, you should distinguish that two works were used by listing an abbreviated version of each title in parentheses.

According to Smith, in-text citations are simple enough (“MLA In-Text Citations” 92) but the “Works Cited” page can get complicated depending on the “variety and particular types of sources used in a given paper” (The Fun of MLA 13).

, If you are paraphrasing or summarizing information from two sources within the same line, cite each source as normal in parentheses but separate the two different sources with a semicolon.

The rules of MLA citations have been discussed by many (Smith 16; Doe 32).

, If you came across the quote you are using in a work other than that which the information originally came from, introduce the original author within the sentence but note the author and page number from which you accessed the information. Proceed this information with the abbreviation “qtd.”

Doe notes that ""in-text citations are fairly easy to write"" (qtd. in Smith 102).

Practice these techniques daily for at least a month, maybe longer.",How to Write With Your Opposite Hand," Every day, write out the alphabet using your non-dominant hand in lowercase, uppercase and cursive (if you know how). At first your hand will be shaky and the letters won't be nearly as neat as with your other hand. However, keep practicing and your writing will start to get better.


If you're a lefty attempting to write with your right hand, turn the page 30 degrees counterclockwise. If you're a righty attempting to write with your left hand, turn the page 30 degrees clockwise.
Do not ""claw"" your hand. It may be tempting to grasp the pencil as tightly as possible, causing your hand to ball up like a claw but this will stop you from writing effectively and can end up hurting. Take note of how your hand is positioned and loosen it up now and then as you write.;
, Try lifting weights with your opposite hand to help strengthen the muscles. Start with light weights and as you get stronger, use heavier and heavier ones.

, Throw it higher and higher, but don't break anything fragile! This is a good excuse to get involved in juggling!

, This gives you a clear visual cue to the method and helps your brain to picture the same action for your non-dominant hand.

, Swap sides with the mouse at your computer so that your non-dominant hand is doing the mouse work––this is actually a good occupational health trick to help prevent repetitive strain injury and it can balance your visual coordination on the screen too.

, Soon you'll be writing fluently with your non-dominant hand, with very few mistakes.

Use your opposite hand to write ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog decides to wake up and be non-lazy"", or similar for practice.

Another way: Find a small paragraph and practice writing the paragraph over and over again. Also, look at the difference in the writings, and see which letter you need to get better at.

, To take this all to the next level, write from left-to-right (normal direction) with your right hand, and from right-to-left with your left, writing backwards sentences that look correct when held up to a mirror. (This is called boustrophedon.) This is useful because righties are used to writing ""from thumb to pinkie"", and may write more naturally with their left hand while writing backwards.

Understand forensic document analysis.,
Request writing samples.,
Look for differences first.,
Compare baseline alignment.,
Measure the space between letters.,
Check height relationships between letters.,
Compare letter shapes.,
Find signs of forgery.",How to Analyze Handwriting (Graphology)2," This field is often mistaken for graphology, especially in Europe where graphology has more of a following in courts. Document analysis can occasionally reveal small hints about age and sex, but it does not try to identify personality.Its main purposes are to identify forgeries, and to compare a suspect's handwriting with a ransom note or other piece of evidence., All samples should be written voluntarily, with similar ink and paper. To practice your first analysis, ask a group of friends to write the same long paragraph of text. Have each person write it twice, on different pieces of paper. When they're done, shuffle them all together and use the techniques below to match each pair.


Criminal investigators like to use at least 3 copies of a full letter, or 20+ copies of a signature.

, A common mistake is to find a couple similarities between the samples, conclude they're the same writer, and stop looking. Challenge yourself to find differences first, then move on to similarities.With that in mind, continue on to find out what to look for.

, Look at the line on the paper, or put a ruler down underneath the writing if the paper is unlined. Different writers tend to write above or below the line. Some will stay level and even the whole way, while others are sloppier and move up and down.

, This is a little finicky, but also more objective than most comparisons. Take a ruler with millimeters and measure the space between letters or words. A significant difference in spacing could mean different writers. This is especially likely if one writing sample connects words with pen strokes, and the other separates them with gaps., Does the writer write the cursive l or k high above the other letters, or compressed down to the same height? This is a more consistent characteristic than the width of the loop or the slant of the letter., There are dozens of curves, loops, connectors, and letter endings that distinguish a writer. Without taking a formal course, the best way to learn these is to inspect a single, long writing sample, then compare it to someone else's. Here are a couple examples to get you started:


No writer writes like a machine. Look for different versions of a letter within the same sample to find out what kind of difference is unreliable. For example, if someone writes two fs with a fat loop and a thin loop, you can't rely on that shape for identification.
Now look for a letter with similar characteristics every time it shows up. For example, in cursive writing a person generally sticks to either a cursive capital I, or a simple vertical line stroke, or a line with crossbars. It's rare to see one writer use more than one of these.

, If you want another exercise, have your friends try to copy each other's signatures and present them in a pile along with the real thing. Here are a few telltale signs:Forgers have to write slowly to copy the writing. This can lead to slight tremors (wiggly lines) and a constant line thickness and shading. (Real signatures usually have lighter and darker shading as the speed changes.)
If the forger hesitates or pauses, you might see ink blots or pen lifts (small gaps in the signature). These are especially common at the start and end of the signature, or between letters.
Try writing your own signature five times, and you'll probably see significant variation. If two signature are extremely similar, down to every curve and line, one of them could be a forgery.

Check out each letter.,
Use bigger letters.,
Look at the heights of your letters.,
Watch out for spacing.",How to Change Your Handwriting2," Do any of them look squished or not formed correctly? Practice writing that letter in good form by comparing it to an online chart., For a period of time, try using bigger letters when you write. That way, you can see if you are making letters in the right way, and you can correct as you go.One way to encourage larger writing is to use wide-ruled paper., Your letters should all come up to about the same height, and any descenders should go about the same length below the line.For instance, your lowercase ""g"" and ""y"" should go down about the same length. Also, they shouldn't be cramping the line below.Use a ruler to check your height. If you lay it across the top of your uppercase and lowercase letters, you can see if you make certain letters shorter or taller.

, Make sure you aren't spacing your letters too far apart or too closely together. Half of a lowercase ""o"" should fit between letters, no more."

Use tracing paper or other lightweight paper.,
Move on to copying.,
Try it on your own.,
Practice the font.",How to Change Your Handwriting3," That is, if you want a new style of writing, you need to relearn the way you write, which won't be that different from the way you learned to write as a kid., You can use font sites to find a font that you admire or even just use your word processing software.

, You can also include pangrams such as ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" Pangrams are texts that contain every letter in the English language, so they are good for practice.Start out using a larger size for your font, such as 14 point.

, Place the paper over the page you printed. Trace over the letters with a pen or pencil., Once you've traced the letters a few times, move on to copying the letters by looking at the letters and trying to write sentences. This forces you to look at how the letters are actually formed., Without looking at the font, try writing in the same style. Though it will not perfectly match the original, you will be using a different handwriting style.

, To make the font your own, you must practice it often. Try writing in a journal or writing out your grocery list in that style. Over time, it will feel more natural.

Strengthen your non-dominant hand.",How to Become Ambidextrous2," Try lifting weights with your opposite hand to help strengthen the muscles. Start with light weights and as you get stronger, use heavier and heavier ones.

"
Do everything with your non-dominant hand.,
Try cooking with your opposite hand.,
Perform simple tasks with your non-dominant hand.,
Start doing fine motor tasks such as mirror writing, playing pool, and cutting cords out of shrimp with your non-dominant hand once you have practiced with simpler tasks.,
Keep using just your non-dominant hand for all complex, non dangerous tasks.,
Learn juggling.,
Play an instrument that involves two hands.",How to Become Ambidextrous3," Even if you only care about becoming ambidextrous for a specific task, it's still better to use your non-dominant hand for everything because skill of the other tasks in your non-dominant hand will partly transfer to the skill of that task, making it faster and less frustrating. Use your non-dominant hand all the time for each task, not half the time. If your goal is to get the highest efficiency at completing a task with either hand, then it's pretty useless to make your dominant hand even more skilled and is more important to focus your attention on gaining skill in your non-dominant hand. Another reason not to use your dominant hand at all is, that although using your dominant hand can't remove skill from your non-dominant hand, not using your dominant hand will lower it's skill and make it feel like less of a nuisance to use your non-dominant hand.

, Mix the eggs or the cake mix with your weaker hand. Stir or beat with a whisk using the same writing motion you'd use for that hand if doing cursive.

, Where you usually brush your teeth, eat with a spoon, smash meat with a tenderizing hammer, or bounce a ball with your dominant hand, try doing those things with your non-dominant hand. There are hundreds of simple tasks that you perform every day, so getting good at doing those with your other hand will help you become more ambidextrous.

, Doing this will also help you to practice the general skill of automatically transferring skill from an action to its mirror image, so that the next task you start doing with your non-dominant hand will be a tiny bit more skilled at doing it with your non-dominant hand than when you first started. The ability to transfer a skill from an action to its mirror image also gets built up each time you do a task with the opposite hand. You can also skip the first 3 steps if you want to hurry to become ambidextrous and can't handle the boredom of completing these tasks more slowly at first.

, Once you do this, your originally non-dominant hand will exceed your originally dominant one in skill level. If you were to instead start by using both hands, one would catch up to the other in skill level and you would start to drift back to being having a slight bit of the dominance you originally had. This would happen because the muscle memory in your originally non-dominant hand will be a shorter term memory than that of your originally dominant hand.

, Try starting with three and four balls. This is a great way to train your weaker arm.

, For example, learn the piano, flute, guitar, saxophone, etc. This can help strengthen your weaker arm and give you greater dexterity in both hands and arms. In piano, however, the main parts are given to your right hand, and it will only make your right hand stronger

, In your word processing software, highlight the text. Move your pointer to the top of the page where two tiny triangles sit on top of each other on a ruler.


Move the bottom one by itself to create hanging indention (1/2 an inch), where the second and subsequent lines of a citation are indented while the first line is all the way to the left.

, Make sure the works cited page and the rest of the paper are in a readable font. Times New Roman is fairly standard.


Format the font to be 12-point.
The margins on the works cited page, like the rest of the paper, should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) all around.

, The title should be centered and also in 12-point font. It should simply be “Works Cited.” Do not bold or italicize it.


Always begin your works cited page on a new page after you finish your paper.

, An example entry would look like this: French, Joe. City of Lights. Akron: Ohio Books, 1994. Print.


In this case, “Joe French” is the author’s name, so you reverse it for the citation because you alphabetize citations by the author’s last name.“City of Lights” is the title of the book, while “Akron” is the city of publication.
“Ohio Books” is the publisher, and “1994” is the publication date. The publication information can be found on the back side of the title page, though if you are using a catalog to look up books, you can usually find it there, as well.
“Print” is the medium of publication.

, For a scholarly article, use this basic format: Smith, George and Jessica Handler. “Kitten Sleeping Patterns.” Cat Behaviors 4.3 (2012): 22-43. Print.


Like the first example, the first author’s name is reversed; it’s normally “George Smith.” However, when you include a second author, his or her name is written in the typically Western way after an “and.”
The title of the article is “Kitten Sleeping Patterns.” Notice that for titles you use title case capitalization, meaning you capitalize important words. “Cat Behavior” is the title of the journal the article is published in, while “4” and “3” are the volume and issue numbers.
Journals are divided by year, and each year is a volume. So the first year is volume one, the second year is volume two, and so on.
Each issue in the year also receives a number, beginning with one and starting over each year. “2012” is the publication date, while “22-43” is the page numbers where the article is in the journal. That is, the issue has a number of articles in it, and these page numbers designate where it is located within the book, not the ones you use.
You designate the page numbers you use within your paper, not on the works cited page.
Finally, “Print” is again the medium of publication.

, For an article from an online database, it would look like this: Smith, George and Jessica Handler. “Kitten Sleeping Patterns.” Cat Behaviors 4.3 (2012): 22-43. JSTOR. Web. 18 November 2014.


The only additions made to this citation are adding in the database name (JSTOR), changing the medium to “Web,” and adding the date you accessed it., For a page on a website, use this format: “How to Find Cats.” AlltheAnswers. Big Internet Company, 2011. Web. 18 November 2014.


In this case, “How to Find Cats” is the name of the webpage. If the webpage has an author, place it before this title like you did in the other cases.
“AlltheAnswers” is the title of the website.
“Big Internet Company” is the publisher and “2011” is the date on the webpage (use “n.d.” if you can’t find a date). Be more specific if possible.
“Web” is the medium of publication, while “18 November 2014” is the date that you access the page.

Look for your author.,
Find the publication date of your book.,
Choose how you will create your in-text citation.,
Cite multiple authors if your book was written by more than one person.,
Write the page number if you are using a direct quote.,
Make sure to put the punctuation in the correct places.",How to Format APA Citations1," The author will be on the outside of the book or on the title page. It’s ok if there is more than one author. For our example, let’s say your author’s name is Georgia Smith.;
, The publication date should be on the back of the title page. Use the most recent date.


For the example, let’s say the book’s publication date is 1995.

, You have two basic ways that you can make a citation. You can name your author at the beginning of the sentence like this, using only the last name: “According to Smith (1995), leaves turn red in the fall.” Notice that in this instance, the date is in parentheses while “Smith” is not.


The other way you can make an in-text citation is to put a citation at the end of the sentence without directly referencing the author in the sentence. This would look like the example: “Leaves turn red in the fall (Smith, 1995).” In this case, both the author and the date are in parenthesis, divided by a comma. Always put the author first and then the date.

, If you have two authors, you can separate the authors’ last names with an ampersand (&). If you have more than two authors, you separate them with commas and an ampersand.


Example of in-text citation for two authors: “Leaves turn read in the fall (Smith & Davis, 1995).
Example of in-text citation for three or more authors: “Leaves turn red in the fall (Smith, Davis, & Baxter, 1995).” With three to five authors, you always list all the authors the first time you cite the source. After that, you’ll use “et al.” in this way: “(Smith et al., 1995).” “Et al.” just means “and others.”
If you have six or more authors, you will always use the “et al.” version, even with the first citation you make.

, In some instances, you’ll also need the page number to explain where you found the information. You must have the page number if you are using a direct quote. Let’s say you found this quote on page 123: “In my experience, leaves change from dark green to red in the fall.” You can cite this information in one of two ways. Whichever way you choose, always put the page number at the end of the sentence, even if you introduce the author and date at the beginning.


Method 1: To use this quote, you would cite your source this way: “Smith (1995) discusses the process this way: ‘In my experience, leaves change from dark green to red in the fall’ (p. 123).” The page number is always last, and you put a “p” followed by period before it.
Method 2: You could also write it this way: “Another writer put it this way: ‘In my experience, leaves change from dark green to red in the fall’ (Smith, 1995, p. 123).” Just like before, you put the information in parenthesis at the end of the sentence and separate it with commas.

, When making an in-text citation with a direct quote, the end quotation mark will come before the citation, followed by a period, like the sentence from above:


Example: “Another writer put it this way: “In my experience, leaves change from dark green to red in the fall” (Smith, 1995, p. 123).”

"
"
Begin with the author’s name.,
Add the date of publication to the citation.,
Write out the full title of the book.,
Write down the city and state where the book was published.,
Add the name of the publishing company to your citation.",How to Format APA Citations2," Just like with an in-text citation, start your reference list citation with the author. However, when you make a citation in the reference list, you’ll also need the author’s initials, too. Put the author’s last name first, followed by a comma and the initial(s) with periods. For example:


One author: “Smith, G.”
If you have more than one author, your citation would look like: “Smith, G., Davis, D., and Baxter, R.”

, Next, you’ll put the date in parenthesis, followed by a period. Here’s an example:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995).”

, Now, you’re going to add in the title of the book. Unlike titles in other types of citations, in APA, you only capitalize the first word of the title, along with the first word of the subtitle. To introduce the subtitle, you use a colon. All the words in the title are italicized. In our example, it would look like this:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995). The world in our words: Why things happen.” In this case, the main title is “The World in Our Worlds,” while the subtitle is “Why Things Happen.” Follow the title with a period.

, The city of publication is usually on the title page or the back of the title page. If there are multiple cities, pick the one closest to where you are. Use the postal abbreviation for the state, and don’t use periods between the letters. Do use a comma between the city and state. If your book was published in New York City, the citation would be:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995). The world in our words: Why things happen. New York City, NY.”

, Place a colon between the state that the book was published in, and the name of the publishing company. Let’s say our book was published by Treehouse Publishers. Our example would therefore look like:


“Smith, G. Davis, D., and Baxter, R. (1995). The world in our words: Why things happen. New York City, NY: Treehouse Publishers.”

Understand what a hanging indentation is.,
Make sure all of your citations have hanging indentations if they are long enough.,
Double space your reference page.",How to Format APA Citations3," The main thing you need to worry about when formatting citations in your reference list is to make a hanging indention. That means that the first line of each citation will be all the way over to the left hand margin, but each line after that will be indented.

, To make a hanging indention, highlight your set of citations, then use the ruler bar at the top of the page. Click on the bottom arrow only, and move it over so that it form a half-inch indentation.

, To make sure that your page is double spaced, highlight the text, and right-click on it.


Find “Paragraph” in the list that appears. Under “Spacing” and “Line Spacing,” select “Double.”

You can also practice good handwriting by borrowing notes from people who have good handwriting. See how they have written each letter and word and copy it.;
, Don't try to change everything all at once. Start with the letter that is sloppiest. If your A looks like a giraffe with eight legs, change it. It'll be easier to see progress this way, too.


Place a letter sample on the side of your paper. Have a short line next to it for practice. Continue this for the whole width of the paper. Skip a line and then do this again with a sample for copying each time. Never do a row of letters; you will tend to copy the one you just finished.

, Take for example lowercase letters ""g,"" ""c,"" ""o,"" and ""e."" They all have that same rounded shape. Good handwriting is consistent, and all these letters should have the same round-ness about them. Once you've worked with letters separately, work with them in their groups.


""M,"" ""n,"" ""u,"" and ""w"" is another common set of letters that may need working. You may also want to consider making your tails consistent (""y"" and ""g,"" for example) or your longer letters the same, like ""h,"" ""p,"" and ""b.""

, Now that the letters are easier, what about writing them in actual works? It is usually best to write down a sentence and then start writing that same sentence a few times slowly. As it gets easier, aim to write faster and faster.


The key is to remember to try to keep each letter the same size. For example, tall letters like ""t,"" ""l,"" ""k,"" etc. should all be the same height. Then letters like ""a,"" ""o,"" ""e,"" etc. should all be the same height, too. You'll need to concentrate at first, but it gets easier! Keep the letters rounded and take your time.
""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" has all the letters of the English language. It's a good sentence if you want to work on every letter!

, Practice connecting the letter before and after with another letter you know well in the same group, such as ""adc,"" ""aca,"" ""ada,"" ""gag,"" etc. When you get good at that, start working in different groupings.


Hard to make letters like ""f"" in cursive can be done with notebook paper turned sideways ¡ using the line as the down stroke for the f. lowercase b and q are other ones that can be successful with this approach. They all have the loop going to the right unlike ""g,"" ""j,"" and ""y.""

, This will make it easier for people to distinguish between letters and joins. Ensure that spaces between words are consistent, too.


A sloping desk encourages more rounding of letters. If your angle isn't what you want it to be, consider changing the angle of your paper or the surface you're writing on.

, You're never going to be perfectly happy with your writing, but you've got to realize that you can write, and that is something to be thankful for. Just find a style that suits you, regardless of what it looks like.


Good handwriting is like a ""good painting"" – subject to fashion, technology and personal judgment. The Mona Lisa was not considered to be a good painting for many centuries until Franco-Italian nationalism made it the focus of attention. Similarly, we consider the serif Renaissance style of handwriting to be barely legible and now encourage our children to write in a sans-serif style resembling digital fonts like Arial. Neither can be considered ""good"" in the long term, but there have been times when each was seen as ideal.

, There is an inverse relationship between legibility and credibility: doctors are universally respected for their knowledge yet derided for the illegibility of their prescriptions; manual laborers receive less respect even though it is generally very easy to read their handwriting. If your handwriting is hard to read, don't stress it. No one is judging.


A similar pattern can be seen between male and female handwriting: the latter tends to reflect the shapes of letters as taught much more closely than male writing, yet people are less likely to be promoted if their handwriting is seen as childish, simplistic or lacking individual identity.

, If you try your best, you will definitely see an improvement in your skills. Keeping a diary or journal is a good way to practice without it feeling like a chore. Go off of the computer for a bit and write instead. Make small efforts to see large changes.


Everything gets better with practice. When you have a bit of spare time, write down everything you can. Write letters to your friends, even if you don't send them. Write notes to your friends in class; or even write notes to yourself. Think of it as doodling.

, Take it slowly at first; when you practice more only then will you get faster. When it comes to handwriting, to be neat takes time. You'll get into the habit of writing clearer and you'll be able to read what you've written. In the end it will pay off.


Write slowly and take the time to make sure each letter is the perfect shape. Speed will come later. Don't stress about it now. You have to walk before you can run. This isn't a race; you have years to perfect your handwriting skills.

Start your entry with the Wikipedia entry title.,
Include the date, if it is available.,
Write the words ""In Wikipedia."",
Follow with the retrieval date.,
End with the URL.",How to Cite Wikipedia1," When citing Wikipedia in APA style, first list the name of the article. You do not need to use quotes or italics. Simply write down the article's title followed by a period. For example, if you were citing an article on Jimmy Carter the beginning your citation would look like this: Jimmy Carter., In APA style, it's customary to include the date an online source was published or last modified. If you cannot find the date, you would simply write ""n.d."" in parenthesis after the entry title. After the date, add a period.For most Wikipedia entries, there will not be an applicable date of publication, because it is edited regularly.Returning to our example, your citation would look like this: Jimmy Carter. (n.d.).

, In APA style, it's customary to mention where you found an electronic source. When citing Wikipedia, you would write ""In Wikipedia,"" italicizing the word ""Wikipedia."" Then add a period.


Let's return to our example to illustrate. Our citation should read as follows: Jimmy Carter. (n.d.). In Wikipedia.

, This is the date you accessed the information. Use the word ""Retrieved"" and then write the date. In APA style, the date is written ""Month Date, Year."" For example, if you retrieved your source on the 15th of October in 2015, you would write, ""October 15, 2015."" Add a comma after the date.To illustrate, here is what our example would look like so far: Jimmy Carter. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved October 15, 2015,

, After the comma at the end of the date, write ""from"" and then include the full URL of the Wikipedia page. In our example, our final citation would read as follows:


Jimmy Carter. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved October 15, 2015, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter

Understand the complexities of writing with your left hand.,
Start slow.,
Practice writing every letter.,
Draw basic shapes.,
Learn mirror script.,
Use the right kind of pens.,
Be realistic.,
Resist the urge to lead with your right side.,
Do simple, everyday tasks with your left hand.,
Practice more precise movements.,
Tie up your right hand.,
Practice throwing a ball.,
Play racket games.,
Lift weights.,
Use your left hand to operate the controls on your computer.",How to Write With Your Left Hand (if Right Handed)," Understand that in order to control your non-dominant hand, your brain will literally have to form new neural connections.


This is not a fast or easy process, so you will need to be prepared to put in many hours of practice if you plan on becoming ambidextrous.
Developing these motor skills will probably give you a whole new appreciation of what babies’ lives are like.;
, Begin printing the alphabet in both capital and lowercase letters, then move on to sentences. When printing becomes comfortable, you can start practicing your cursive.


If your writing is very messy in the beginning, start by tracing large text out of a book or magazine. It may also help to buy children’s paper, which has widely spaced lines for large printing and dotted center lines to control the letter proportions.
Another good thing to do is to observe the way left handers write or just ask them for some tips.

, Write ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" or ""Five boxing wizards jump quickly"" over and over to improve left hand neatness. These sentences are good because they use every single letter in the English alphabet.


You should also practice writing the most common words in your language, as this will teach your muscles common letter combinations. Lists of the most common words in each language can be found on Wikipedia.
Be prepared for the fact that your left arm and hand muscles will be quite sore after writing practice. This is because you are training certain muscles for the very first time.

, Drawing basic shapes will help to strengthen your left hand and give you more control over the pen or pencil.


Stick people, square houses with rectangular chimneys, round-headed cats with triangular ears…the goal here is to become more dexterous, not to produce a Rembrandt.
Try coloring them in, too, to make you feel more comfortable with your left hand
Also, try drawing straight lines from left to right using your left hand. It'll teach you to push, not pull.

, For left handers, it's easier to pull the pen to the left than to push it to the right. Therefore writing backwards with your left hand is easier than writing forwards.


You can just write backwards (from right to left) or you can practice mirror script, where the letters themselves are flipped around.
Writing backwards is also helpful because you won't smear the ink or tear the page when you write with a pen -- however, it won't be that easy for others to read, so try to save it for your diary (just like Leonardo DaVinci!)

, Liquid ink pens and especially gel pens are worth trying, as they require less pressure and strength when writing.


This makes writing more comfortable and leaves your hand less likely to cramp up at the end of your practice session.
Be sure to use quick-drying ink though, or the text may get smudged as your left hand moves across the page.

, Don't expect results in just one day. It takes lots of time to get achieve neat, legible writing with your non-dominant hand.

, You may be surprised to discover how deeply ingrained this habit is -- both physically and mentally. Breaking it will help your brain cope with attempting more involved tasks down the road.


If you open doors with your right hand by default, start opening them with your left.
If you usually take the first step on a staircase with your right foot, do it with the left.
Keep working at it until leading with your left feels natural and easy.

, Good activities to start with include:


Eating your food (especially using a spoon).
Blowing your nose.
Scrubbing dishes.
Brushing your teeth.
Dialing phone number and writing SMS on a cell phone.

, Now that your left hand is comfortable with sloppier movements like scrubbing and brushing, begin refining your hand-eye coordination.


Tracing is a great place to start: having a defined edge to work with will help force your eye, which is visually tracing the outline, and your left hand, which is physically tracing it, to work in sync.
Trace your right hand onto a piece of paper. Pushing the pencil against 3-D contours will help guide the left hand.
Graduate to tracing 2-D images. You can think of this as taking down the gutter guards at the bowling alley.

, The hardest thing is to actually remember to use your non-dominant hand consistently during the day, so you need a good way to remind you not to use your dominant hand.


The thumb is used in almost every situation you use your dominant hand. Not being able to move it freely is an excellent way to make you aware of all the times you're using it -- so try tying your right thumb to your right index finger with a piece of string.
You could also try wearing a glove on your right hand or putting your right hand in your pocket or behind your back.

, Throwing and catching a ball with your left hand is a fun way to strengthen your left hand while also improving your hand-eye coordination. Simply squeezing the ball firmly in your hand will also help to strengthen the fingers.

, Playing tennis, squash or badminton while holding the racket in your left hand is a great way to strengthen the hand, which will give you greater control when writing.

, Use a small 5-pound (or less) weight and lift it with your left hand. You can also try to exercise each finger individually by lifting a very small weight with each finger of your left hand.

, Switch the controls on your mouse so you can use it with your left hand. Also, try pressing the spacebar with your left hand. It's harder than you think!

Create a sentence that needs a citation.,
Add an in-text citation.,
Make a reference at the end.,
Add a date as needed.",How to Cite the Constitution1," Your sentence will need a citation if you paraphrase or quote parts of the Constitution. You can use information from the Constitution to back up an argument, such as arguing for a certain freedom in an opinion paper.For example, you might write the following: ""In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.""
You may also write the following example that quotes the Constitution: The U.S. Constitution notes that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."";
, An in-text citation generally goes at the end of a sentence, though in some cases it follows an author's name or article in APA. Nonetheless, for the Constitution, it will often go at the end of the sentence.Start with the open parenthesis, followed by ""U.S. Const."" and the amendment or article number. For an amendment, use ""amend."" and for an article, use ""art."" and ""§"" for the section. Follow with a close parenthesis. The citation goes before the period but after any quotation marks.
Use Roman numerals for amendments and articles, and Arabic numerals for sections and clauses.
The first example would look this way: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion (U.S. Const. amend. I).
In the second example, you could add the citation after the mention of the Constitution: The U.S. Constitution (amend. I) notes that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""

, While you've noted where it came from in your paper, you also need to add it to your citations at the end of your paper. The basic format for citing the Constitution is the same for both in-text citations and end references.An end citation would look like the following example: U.S. Const. amend. I.

, If an amendment or clause is currently in use, you don't need to add a date. However, if you're referring to an out-of-date part of the Constitution, you should add a date stating when it was repealed.The date will go after the citation: Prohibition was the law of the land in the 1920s and early 1930s (U.S. Const. amend. XVIII, repealed 1933).
The end citation would look like this example: U.S. Const. amend. XVIII (repealed 1933).

Take note of every source you use during the research process.,
Keep the notes on your sources organized.,
Track which sources you actually use.,
Place your reference page at the end of your paper.,
Format each reference according to the appropriate style guide.,
Alphabetize your reference page by the authors' last names.,
Make sure to include every resource you used in your paper.,
Use the correct spacing and indentation.,
Learn how to reference books according to the appropriate style guide.,
Learn how to reference journal articles according to the appropriate style guide.,
Use other resources to learn how to format more complicated sources.",How to Do a Reference Page for a Research Paper," When you are reading and writing notes, take down all relevant information about the source.


For books, this includes the author, the title of the book, the editors (if it has named editors), the name of the essay plus the page numbers of the essays, the publishing company, the place of publication, the date of publication, and where you found the book (more for your own purposes).
If you are using a journal article, you'll need the author's name, the name of the article, the name of the journal, the volume and issue number, the date of publication, the page numbers of the article, and likely the DOI (digital object identifier—a number like an ISBN for books) and/or the database or website you found the article.;
, When taking notes, make sure you mark down which source the information came from. Also, try to keep all of your reference page materials in the same place, as this will save you significant time when writing your reference page.


One helpful way of keeping track of your sources is to write source cards. These are small note cards that contain all of the relevant information on a particular source.
Source cards are a neat and convenient way of organizing your sources - you can store all of your source cards in a small box or folder, in alphabetical order.

, Typically, you will only include the resources you actually cited or paraphrased in your paper on your reference page. Therefore it's important to make a note of which references you actually cite within your paper and which references you merely use for background reading.


However, in some instances, you may also need to reference sources that were beneficial to your argument, but that you didn't end up citing in the paper. These sources shouldn't be listed on the reference page itself, but on a separate page, such as the Modern Language Association's ""Work Consulted"" page.
It is more common to use only a ""Works Cited"" page, therefore you should only include a ""Works Consulted""page if your teacher or professor requests it.

, Your reference page comes at the end of your paper, usually before any appendices or glossaries. Place the reference page on a new page directly after the end of your paper.

, Begin inputting your resources according to the standard required by your school.


For instance, you may be required to use American Psychological Association style (APA), the Modern Language Association's guidelines (MLA), Chicago style, or American Sociological Association style (ASA).
You'll find examples of each of these styles in the section below. Each will have you create slightly different references, though you will use the same basic information.

, Once you have typed up all of the references, organize them according to the authors' last names. If a source doesn't have an author, use the first part of the title to alphabetize it.


When you have multiple works by the same author, you can also use the title to decide which reference comes first in an alphabetized list.

, A reference page is a compilation of all of your cited sources. Forgetting to provide a reference for a source you cited in your paper could leave you open to charges of plagiarism, even if it was accidental.

, After you have written your reference page, you'll need to revise it to ensure the formatting is correct. Two basic formatting considerations are as follows:


Double-space your reference page just as you double-spaced the rest of your paper.
Use hanging indention. Hanging indentation is when the first line of each reference is all the way over to the left, while any subsequent lines are indented.

, In the following examples, ""Georgina Roberts"" is the author, and ""Eating Pie for Dinner"" is the title of the book. The publisher is Great Books for Eating, located in Waco, Texas. The date of publication is 2002. ""Print"" is the medium of publication.



MLA: Roberts, Georgina. Eating Pie for Dinner. Waco: Great Books for Eating, 2002. Print.

APA: Roberts, G. (2002). Eating pie for dinner. Waco, Texas: Great Books for Eating.

Chicago: Roberts, Georgina. Eating Pie for Dinner. Waco, Texas: Great Books for Eating, 2002.

ASA: Roberts, Georgina. 2002. Eating Pie for Dinner. Waco, TX: Great Books for Eating.
Note that the two styles used most often in the sciences, APA and ASA, both place higher value on the date, pushing it closer to the beginning of the reference. Chicago and MLA are used more often in the humanities, so the date is not quite as important in those styles.

, In the following examples, ""Joy Thompson"" is the author, and ""Pie for Life"" is the name of the article, which was published in the journal ""Bakers Anonymous."" The volume and issue number are 8 and 2, respectively. It was published in 2005, and the page numbers for the article are 35-43. The medium of publication is ""web."" The digital object identifier (DOI) is 102342343. It was accessed on the February 2, 2007.



MLA: Thompson, Joy. ""Pie for Life."" Bakers Anonymous 8.2 (2005): 35-43. Web. 2 Feb. 2007.

APA: Thompson, J. (2005). Pie for life. Bakers Anonymous, 8(2), 35-43. doi:102342343

Chicago: Thompson, Joy. ""Pie for Life."" Bakers Anonymous 8, no. 2 (2005): 35-43. Accessed February 2, 2007. Doi: 102342343.

ASA: Thompson, Joy. 2005. ""Pie for Life."" Bakers Anonymous 8 (2):35-43.

, If you are curious about how to make more complicated references in each style, Purdue's Online Writing Lab (OWL) is a good resource for figuring out style guidelines. It provides examples of each style, as well as information on how to cite different types of sources.

Compare the source page approach.,
Compare page number application.,
Compare source dating.,

,


For sources with the same author surnames include a first name initial. For example: J. Johnson 12-13
For sources having authors with the same initials include their full names. For example: John Johnson 12-13
For two or three authors of the source include their last names in the order they appear on the source. For example: Smith, Wollensky, and Johnson 45

,


For sources with two authors: Example - Smith, J. K., & Sampson, T. (Date). Title
For more than two authors: Example - Smith, J. K., Sampson, T., Hubbard, A. J., Anderson, J., Thompson, T., Silva, P.Bhatia, N. (Date). Title

, In APA style, author’s name is followed by date of publication and is in parenthesis. On the contrary, in MLA style, date follows the publisher and is not in parenthesis.

, Only the first word of the title, the first word of a subtitle, and any proper nouns (like names) are capitalized in APA style. Everything else is lowercase. Also, the title is written in italics. All major words in the title are capitalized and the title is underlined in MLA style.

, The source page is called a “Works Cited” in MLA style, whereas APA uses the word “References” for the source page.

, MLA does not allow commas to separate the material or p. pp. before the page numbers. But APA does use commas and, if a page is mentioned, uses p. and pp.

, MLA exhibits little concern for the age of a source unlike in APA, which exhibits a preference for current publications by providing a means of referencing in sources in progress or not yet accepted for publication.

, MLA style prescribes reference formats for a variety of unpublished sources. But APA does not approve any unpublished interviews, and non-archived electronic communications for inclusion in the reference list and thus are cited only in the text.

"
"
Begin with the article title.,
Add the larger source.,
Include the publisher.,
Add the date of publication, if possible.,
Write the media format.,
End with the date you found the source.",How to Cite Wikipedia2," In MLA style, you would usually begin an online citation with the author's name. As Wikipedia articles do not have authors, you would simply skip to the article name. Put this in quotations and include a period inside the quotations. Using Jimmy Carter as an example again, you would start your article with ""Jimmy Carter."", MLA style dictates you must include the larger source from which you found the article. If you pulled an article from the New York Times, you would write New York Times in italics after the article name. As you pulled your article from Wikipedia, you simply need to write Wikipedia. Follow with a period. Using our example, our citation would not read as follows:


""Jimmy Carter."" Wikipedia.


, In MLA style, you're supposed to include the publisher. When working with online sources, this information is not always known. However, when working with Wikipedia, it's appropriate to write Wikipedia.org as the publisher. Follow with a period. Our example would now read:


""Jimmy Carter."" Wikipedia. Wikipedia.org.

, You should usually include the date of an online publication. You may be able to figure out when a Wikipedia article was first published by clicking on the ""History"" tab on the top of the page. However, as Wikipedia articles update so frequently it can be hard to find the precise publication date. It may be best simply write ""n.p."" to indicate the publication date is unknown.Using our example, we would now have the following citation:


""Jimmy Carter."" Wikipedia. Wikipedia.org. n.p.

, MLA style requires you to write the media format of a source you're using. This indicates if the source was in the form of a book, journal, web page, and so on. As you're using the Internet, you would write ""Web."" Follow this with a period.Our source would now read as follows:


""Jimmy Carter."" Wikipedia. Wikipedia.org. n.p. Web.

, In MLA style, you would end citing a web source by listing the date you accessed the information. In MLA style, you write the date, then the month, then the year. You do not use commas. For example, if you accessed the article on February 2nd, 2016 you would write ""2 February 2016.""Our final citation would read like this:

""Jimmy Carter."" Wikipedia. Wikipedia.org. n.p. Web. 2 February 2016.

"
"
Begin with the title.,
Add the access date or the date the site was last modified, if possible.,
Add the URL.,
Try to mention website citations in the text.",How to Cite Wikipedia3," In Chicago Style citations, web sources are usually cited very briefly. To begin, you would simply write the title of an article in quotations followed by a comma. For example, ""Jimmy Carter,""., You should include the access date or the date the site was last modified. This is to indicate to readers how up-to-date the information is. As Wikipedia changes so frequently, it makes sense to add the date you accessed the information. In Chicago style, you list the month, then the date, a comma, and then the year. For example, if you accessed the information on March 11, 2015 you would write ""March 11, 2015."" Include a comma after the date.The example citation would now read: ""Jimmy Carter,"" accessed March 11, 2015,

, You should always add the URL after the date. List the full URL and end with a period. This is all the information required for Chicago Style citations when citing Wikipedia.The example citation would now read: ""Jimmy Carter,"" accessed March 11, 2015, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter.

, In Chicago Style, it's generally preferred that you do not cite web citations in your bibliography. Instead, include footnotes or cite the information in the text itself. For example, ""According to the Wikipedia page, Jimmy Carter was born in 1924."""
"
Create your sentence.,
Place the in-text citation at the end of the sentence.,
Make an end reference.,
Add a year if necessary.",How to Cite the Constitution2," Just like in APA style, you need to create a sentence where you need a citation. You can cite the U.S. Constitution as a reference for making a legal argument, for example, when creating an opinion paper.


For instance, you can use the same example from above: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.
Another example is the following sentence: The U.S. Constitution notes that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""

, Unlike APA, the in-text citation always comes at the end of the sentence, before the period and after the quotation mark. However, like APA, you can leave off ""US Const."" in the citation if you use it in the sentence.Start with an open parenthesis, then add ""US Const."" Follow that with the amendment, section, article, and/or clause and a close parenthesis. Use Roman numerals for amendments and Arabic numerals for sections.
The example would look like this sentence: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion (US Const. amend. I).
The second example would look this way: The U.S. Constitution notes that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" (amend. I).

, Like APA, the MLA end reference is fairly similar to the in-text citation. However, unlike APA, you'll spell out more of the reference at the end than you do in the in-text citation. Also, you'll usually use more capitalization and italicize ""U.S. Constitution.""The end-text citation will look like this example: U.S. Constitution. Amend. I

, If the amendment has been appealed or you want to place emphasis on the year it was enacted, you can add a date. Simply add it after the amendment or section with a short description before it, such as ""repealed 1933."""
"
Create your sentence.,
Add a footnote.,
Create the footnote.,
Skip the final citation.",How to Cite the Constitution3," Of course, first you need to write a sentence that needs a citation from the U.S. Constitution. Try writing one that directly references or quotes the U.S. Constitution. Only then will you need a citation at the end.


Take the same example from above: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.

, Chicago style works a little differently in that you add a footnote rather than a citation in text. Basically, you tell your word processing software to add a footnote at the end of the sentence, after the period this time. It creates a number that connects to the same number at the bottom of the page.For example, your sentence would look this way: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.1

The number will be in superscript, as it is in the example.
To add a footnote, put the cursor at the end of the sentence. Choose ""References"" and ""Insert Footnote."" The word processing system will do the rest.

, The footnote at the bottom of the page is where you'll put your reference. Start with ""U.S. Constitution."" Follow that with the amendment, section, article, and/or clause. Use Roman numerals for articles, and Arabic numbers for everything else.For example, your footnote would look like the following example: 1. U.S. Constitution, amend. 1.
When naming a section, use ""sec."" not the section symbol ""§.""

, Unlike APA and MLA, you don't need an end citation when you're citing constitutions. The main reason you don't need the citation is that these are common documents that are easy to find, and the point of the end reference is to point the reader to the source."

Understand the difference between Chicago and MLA in-text citations.,
Open a parenthesis at the end of the sentence you wish to reference.,
Type the author's last name.,
Include the page reference, then close the parenthesis.,
Delete the Chicago citation.,
Alternatively, include the author's name in the body of the text and just cite the page number.,
Understand the difference between Chicago and MLA reference page citations.,
Write the last name of the author, followed by the first name.,
Put the title of the book in italics.,
Include the city of publication, the publisher and the year of publication.,
For MLA style, include the medium of publication.,
Remember to alphabetize your reference list.",How to Convert Chicago Style to MLA Citation," The method of doing in-text citations varies significantly between Chicago style and MLA citations. In Chicago style, the in-text citations take the form of footnotes at the bottom of the page (or at the end of the paper). In MLA, the citation is given in the body of the text, in parenthesis.


In Chicago style, the footnote is basically a full reference like you’d normally use at the end of your paper, with slightly different punctuation. A Chicago style citation would look something like this: “Peaches are best in August.1” The corresponding footnote (which is referenced by the number in superscript) will have more information: “1Gretchen Jones, Peaches for Everyone (Seattle: Pine Books, 1992), 393.”
In this example, “Gretchen” is the author’s first name; “Jones” is the author’s last name. “Peaches for Everyone” is the title, while “Seattle” is the place of publication and “1992” is the date. Finally, “393” is the page number where you found the information.
Follow the steps below to find out how you would convert Chicago style to MLA, using this specific example.;
, After the sentence you wish to reference (in this case ""Peaches are best in August"") open a parenthesis, leaving the period and superscript number in place for now. If you delete the number in superscript, the footnote at the bottom of the page will be deleted. It's more convenient to leave the footnote in place for now, so you can refer to the information it contains when writing your citation. At this point, you citation should look like this:


""Peaches are best in August (.1""

, After the open parenthesis, type in the author's last name. You can get this information from the footnote at the bottom of the page. In this example, the author's name is Gretchen Jones, so the citation would be as follows:


""Peaches are best in August (Jones.1""

, The next thing you need to do is include the page number of the quote you are referencing, then close the parenthesis. There's no need to include any periods, commas or semi-colons. For example:


""Peaches are best in August (Jones 393).1""

, At this point you have finished the MLA citation, but you still need to delete the Chicago citation. Typically, if your paper was formatted correctly using the built-in footnote function in your word processor, all you need to do is delete the number in superscript at the end of the sentence. Usually, that will also make the footnote disappear. If it doesn’t, go down to the bottom of the page and delete the footnote. The finished MLA footnote should look like this:


""Peaches are best in August (Jones 393).""

, Another, alternative way to do in-text citations using MLA is to include the author's name in the text. When you've already referenced the author in the text, there's no need to repeat this information in the citation, so all you need to do is include the page number. For example:


“Jones wrote the following about the subject: ‘Peaches are best in August’ (393).”
Keep in mind that the quotation mark will come before the parenthesis, while the period will come after.

, With reference page citations, the citation method is almost exactly the same. The only difference is that MLA includes the medium of publication (print, web, etc) at the end of the citation, after the year of publication. For step by step instructions on how to do reference page citations for MLA, see below.

, To begin the citation, write the last name of the author, a comma, then the last name, followed by a period. For example:


Jones, Gretchen.

, Just like Chicago style, the next step is to place the name of the book in italics, followed by a period. For example.


Jones, Gretchen. Peaches for Everyone.

, After the title of the book, you should include the city of publication, followed by a colon. Then put the publisher, a comma, the year of publication, followed by a period. For example:


Jones, Gretchen. Peaches for Everyone. Seattle: Pine Books, 1992.

, At this point, the Chicago reference is finished. To do an MLA reference you need to include one final piece of information — the medium of publication. If you are referencing a book, all you need to do is write the word ""Print"" followed by a period. For example:


Jones, Gretchen. Peaches for Everyone. Seattle: Pine Books, 1992. Print.

, Whether your reference page uses MLA or Chicago style, you will need to put your references in alphabetical order from A to Z. If two authors have the same last name, use their first names to decide the order.

For the tweet or Facebook post: “To make less dense cakes, make sure to sift the flour when adding dry ingredients (Knight).”
For the YouTube video, use a shortened form of the title instead: “Green objects come in a variety of shapes (All Things).”

Recognize different citation styles.,
Create in-text citations.,
Note the author’s name.,
Report the title information.,
Designate the format.,
Indicate publication data.,
Provide the source.,
Include web data if necessary.,
Review your citations.",How to Cite Primary Sources1," Depending on the discipline or preferred tastes, there are different styles of citations for published primary sources such as books, memoirs, and reports.However, these styles contain the same basic information and only vary in the format in which you write the citation.The two primary forms of citing published primary sources are:Chicago, used mostly in history and other humanities fields. This is also sometimes called ""Turabian"" style. For the specifics of Chicago citation format, see: http://www.loc.gov/teachers/usingprimarysources/chicago.html


Modern Languages Association, or MLA, used mostly for literature. For the specifics of MLA, see: http://www.loc.gov/teachers/usingprimarysources/mla.html.;
, In addition to creating a bibliography of references at the end of your text, you will usually need to cite your primary sources as you go. There are different ways of doing in-text citations, depending on the style guide you use.


Chicago style does not generally use parentheses to mark in-text citations.Instead, you place a superscript number after your reference to indicate a footnote or endnote, like so: ""In Chicago style, use a superscript number to indicate a citation.""1 For Chicago style, you list the full reference in the footnote.
MLA style uses parenthetical citation to cite sources within texts. In most cases, you will use the author's last name and the page number.You can cite the author's name in the actual sentence, followed by a parenthetical citation: According to Wordsworth, poetry expresses ""the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings"" (263).
You can cite the author's name and page number in the parenthetical: Poetry is the ""spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings"" (Wordsworth 263).



, The first entry of your published material citation is the author’s name. This gives the author credit for the work while helping your reader more quickly locate the source if she chooses.Write the author's last name, first name, and then middle initial.If there is no author that you can find, write “anonymous” or “author unknown.”
For example: O’Connor, Edward M.

, The second entry of your published material citation is data about the title. This gives your reader further information about how to best locate the source.Italicize the title information.Keep the title information within manageable limits.If the title is three lines long, use the primary title and first clause. For example: The Final Report of the United States Displaced Persons Commission instead of Memo to America: The DP Story: The Final Report of the United States Displaced Persons Commission.

For example: O’Connor, Edward M. The Final Report of the United States Displaced Persons Commission.


, For published primary material, your third entry within the citation should designate the format of the source. This information, in particular, can make it easier for your reader to find the source.Describe the format type with designations such as manuscript, letter, pamphlet, map, chart, photograph, film, or newspaper.In some cases, websites may be primary sources.For example: O’Connor, Edward M. The Final Report of the United States Displaced Persons Commission. Manuscript.

, The fourth item of information in a published primary citation is the publication data. This ascribes credit to the proper company or body, and may help you or other readers obtain a copy of the source.Record the publication city, publishing company, and copyright date. This information is generally located in places such as the inside cover of manuscripts, the back of photographs, or the box of films.You may not be able to locate this information. In this case, note as much publication information as you can.
For example: O’Connor, Edward M. The Final Report of the United States Displaced Persons Commission. Manuscript. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1952.

, You may need to indicate where you found your published primary source if it did not come from the general library stacks. This information can allow you and your reader to more readily access the material either at the source or order it.You should always know the source of your material. This is absolutely vital to proving you’ve done the work.
For example: O’Connor, Edward M. The Final Report of the United States Displaced Persons Commission. Manuscript. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1952. From Library of Congress, The Papers of Edward M. O’Conner, 1942-1955.

, Institutions are increasingly digitizing their collections and making sources available online to the public. If your published source is from the Internet, you will need to include the website and last time you accessed the page.For example: O’Connor, Edward M. The Final Report of the United States Displaced Persons Commission. Manuscript. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1952. From Library of Congress, The Papers of Edward M. O’Conner, 1942-1955. http://xxx (last accessed May 1, 2014).

, Before you publish or submit your work, review your citations. Because of the amount of information required in citations, it is easy to conflate items or miss a vital element. This can protects you from allegations of not doing the work or misrepresenting your sources.

Cite a ‘tweet’ in APA.,
Begin with the person’s username for a Facebook post.,
Create your Youtube citation.,
Write your in-text citation.",How to Cite Social Media Using MLA and APA2," For Twitter, begin this time with the person’s Twitter handle with a period at the end. Place the date it was published in parenthesis, beginning with the day and following it with the month and year with a period afterwards. Enter the full text of the post next, followed by a period, “,” a period, and the website; don’t use the quotation marks in the citation.For example:


“@CakesforLife. (2013, January 22). Always sift your flour before adding it to the cake. . Retrieved from www.twitter.com”

, The username should be followed by a period and the date in parenthesis; add a period afterwards. Use the full post next, followed by “” and the website:


“Rfitz. (2012, May 24). I baked the best cake today. Stay tuned for the recipe. . Retrieved from www.facebook.com”

, For a YouTube video or other video site, begin with the author’s last name, followed by his or her first initial(s) and a period. Use the date of publication next in parenthesis, followed by a period, the title of the video, and “.” Add the website at the end:


“Gross, J. (2004, April 22). All things green . Retrieved from www.youtube.com/greenthingsforlife”

, For an in-text citation, use the author’s handle or last name. In the sentence you are citing, place a parenthesis at the end before the period. Put the author’s last name or the handle in the parenthesis, followed by a comma and the date:


“To make less dense cakes, make sure to sift the flour when adding dry ingredients (CakesforLife, 2013).”

"
"
Place the author’s name and the page number in parentheses.,
Include the most relevant information for non-print sources.,
Place the parenthetical citation at the end of the line of text.,
Alter the basic format if necessary.,
Use a limited citation if your text contains signal words.,
Keep track of consecutive citations.,
Check the MLA style guide if you are doing more advanced research.",How to Cite Sources in MLA Format1," Whenever you quote from or paraphrase a source in your writing, you should include an in-text citation. The basic format recommends putting the last name of the author of the source, followed by the page number, in parentheses.For example, if you are quoting from page 28 of John Francis’ book Planetwalker, you would reference this as (Francis 28).
If the work has multiple authors, list them. For example: (Ohlin and Upson 127)
If the source has more than three authors, just use the first one and the abbreviation “et al.”: (Ohlin et al. 127);
, Many digital, visual, and auditory formats do not have page numbers or other information that corresponds to that used when citing traditional print sources. The MLA recommends using the most relevant information you can find (like an author’s name or title) when citing such sources. For instance:If you are citing an article by Frank Miller from CNN.com called “Midnight in Gotham City” that does not have page numbers, your parenthetical citation can be simply (Miller).
Since page numbers for ebooks will vary from device to device, include the chapter number or other section heading instead, if possible: (Miller ch. 2).

, Position the parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence where you include the quote or reference. Normally, the parenthetical citation should come before the period at the end of the sentence. If you are including a long, indented block quote, however, place the parenthetical citation after the final period., If a source does not have a named author, just put a shortened version of the title followed by the page number in the parenthetical citation. If you are citing multiple works by the same author, include a brief title of the source. For example, you may have parenthetical citations that look like:(“Report on International Banking Regulations”), for a website with this title but no listed author or page numbers.
(Franken “Wake Up!” 99) and (Franken “Dawn in America” 87), if you are citing two works by Franken.

, You don’t have to make your writing cluttered with repeated information. If your text makes clear the source/author you are citing, just include the page number in parentheses.For instance, you may have a sentence that looks something like: “Jasmine Whitaker discusses the concept of ‘hyperspeed reading’ in her second book, Read ‘til You Drop (45).”

, If you reference the same work several times in row, you can use a short form parenthetical citation. Your reader will assume the subsequent citations reference the same source. Give a full citation when you reference a new work. For instance:

”The concept of ‘hyperspeed reading’ describes a method for reading far more quickly than normal (Whitaker 45). It asks that readers ‘guess what a text will say before they actually read each line’ (47). Other scholars doubt that readers can make substantial use of this technique, citing concerns like ‘the lack of attention given to things one hasn’t seen yet’ (Jackson 128).”

, The basic format of in-text citations is useful and acceptable for many forms of writing. However, if you are doing specialized research or writing for a specific audience, you may be expected to include additional information in your citations, such as edition or chapter numbers.The MLA Handbook contains official guidelines on more specialized citation needs.
If you are a student, check with your teacher about what kind of citation requirements you may need to follow.

Understand archival citations.,
Check your source for citation guides.,
Specify the repository.,
Reveal the record group.,
Disclose additional provenance information.,
Provide item information.,
Cite web sources.,
Review your citations.",How to Cite Primary Sources2," In many disciplines and types of work, you may need to draw upon archives to compose your work. This can help you and your readers quickly and easily access the material if you want to revisit it or they want to check your work.Take very detailed notes when you research so that you can include the most comprehensive citation information possible., Many archives have preferred citation formats for their records. This can help you, your readers, archivists and other organizational personnel more quickly locate the material if necessary.Ask the archivists or staff when you visit an archive if they have preferred methods of citation for their documents.
For example, the National Archives of the United States lists the repository as the last item in a citation.By contrast, the German Federal Archives lists the repository as the first item., You will need to give the specific repository, which is the location that holds the archival material, in your citation.This shows your readers where they can find the material, and can help you relocate the material if need be.


Many national archives have multiple repositories, and you will need to also designated this information.
For example, the National Archives of the United States and the German Federal Archives have several locations across each country. In these cases, you would note: National Archives and Records Administration- College Park (NACP).For the Bundesarchiv in Koblenz: BArchK., Most archives are organized into distinct record groups by subject. The overarching record group is the most important pointer to you and your readers about where to find the specific document(s) you cite.Include the record group, even if you don’t note any other information. This information gives credence to your citation.
If you are working at a smaller repository without record groups, provide the best information that you are able.
For example: NACP, Records of the Occupation Military Government for Germany, Record Group (RG) 260.Likewise, BArchK B 106., Depending on the repository and record group, you may have additional data such as series and file units. Provide as much of this information as you are able to help support your work and give other readers the opportunity to consult the same material.Additional types of provenance, or source, information include: subgroups, series, file units, and page numbers.For example: Files 1-D/ 2.1 to 1-D/ 3, Box 10, Records of the Bureau and Consular Affairs Lot File 62-D-146, Central Records of the State Department, Record Group 59, NACP.Likewise, BArchK B 106/ 1659., Record the specific information about the item that you are citing. Not only does this provide your reader context about the document, but it can also make it easier to locate at a later date.Item information comes from the document that you cite. It should include recipients, authors, date, and title of the document.For example, Secret Non-Regional Program US-Escapee Program, undated. Files 1-D/ 2.1 to 1-D/ 3, Box 10, Records of the Bureau and Consular Affairs Lot File 62-D-146, Central Records of the State Department, Record Group 59, NACP.Likewise, BArchK B 106/ 1659 Verzeichnis von Legionsrat von Puttkamer, Auswärtiges Amt an Innenminister Robert Lehr, Bundesministerium des Innern, 05 Januar 1978., Just as with published primary sources, many archives are digitizing non-sensitive material and making it available to the public. If you accessed your archival material online, include all of the aforementioned citation information and the website at which you accessed it.For example, Secret Non-Regional Program US-Escapee Program, undated. Files 1-D/ 2.1 to 1-D/ 3, Box 10, Records of the Bureau and Consular Affairs Lot File 62-D-146, Central Records of the State Department, Record Group 59, NACP. http://xxx.xxx.xxx. (last accessed September 8, 2015).

, It’s very important that you review your archival citations before submitting work. This can help minimize the risk of accusations that you haven’t done the work or incurring difficulties from archives for incorrectly citing their collections.

Reach your own conclusions as to the possible definitions.,
View the definitions together as constituting a movement.,
Note that the term ""digital rights management"" is not exclusive to copyright protection.,
Note that the context of file sharing is not as the wording suggests (the sharing of files of information in files from hand to hand), but rather the concept, the freedom, and the availability of online sharing of information.","How to Define Open Source, Digital Rights Management, and File Sharing Concepts"," These are open to interpretation and will expand or change over time as new elements arise and as aspects of open source, DRM, and file sharing solidify across all communities of users. The definitions at the moment are considered to be as follows:



Open source: This means “a program in which the source code of a computer program is made available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.” The code is typically developed by larger “group of programmers improve upon the code and share the changes within the community.”

The idea of open source “rejects secrecy and centralized control of creative work in favor of decentralization, transparency, and unrestricted (""open"") sharing of information.”
Source refers to the human-readable source code of computer programs as opposed to the compiled programming language, or object code, that run on computers but cannot be easily understood or modified by people.
There is no direct law regarding open source. However as open source is related to IPR protection and copyrights issues, you can look at EU legislation at the moment.



Digital rights management (DRM): This is a generic term which is used to described a secure technological framework (system) to prevent redistribution of digital content (such as: music, movies, audio CDs, computer games, e-books, documents, raw data or any other electronic data) in a manner contrary to the will of the rights owners.

Rights owners are usually copyright-holding companies such as Amazon, Sony, Microsoft, Apple Inc., AOL or the BBC. These companies are using DRM systems to control how the digital content is distributed.
DRM technologies play vital roles in processes involving in the flow of digital content.
The legal regulations of DRM are stipulated in a WIPO Copyright Treaty and in the EU Directive 2001/29/EC.



File sharing: This is the public or private sharing of computer data or space in a network with various levels of access privilege, the term file sharing almost always means sharing files in a network, even if in a small local area network. File sharing allows a number of people to use the same file or file by some combination of being able to read or view it, write to or modify it, copy it, or print it. Typically, a file sharing system has one or more administrators. Users may all have the same or may have different levels of access privilege. It is the activity of making files available to other users for download over the internet, but also over smaller networks.

Usually file sharing follows the peer-to-peer model, where the files are stored on and served by personal computers of the users. Most people who engage in file sharing are also downloading files that other users share.
There has been great discussion over perceived and actual legal issues surrounding file sharing. In circumstances where trading partners are in different countries with different legal codes, there are significant problems to contend with. Read the existing case law and media stories for more information.

;
, The main thing for “this movement is that programmers not concerned with proprietary ownership or financial gain will produce a more useful and bug-free product for everyone to use. The concept relies on peer review to find and eliminate bugs in the program code, a process which commercially developed and packaged programs do not utilize.”


The concept relies on peer review to find and eliminate bugs in the program code, a process which commercially developed and packaged programs do not utilize.

, You can also refer this term to the restrictions associated with specific instances of digital works or devices.


The fact of use of DRM is controversial in itself. Some proponents of DRM are state that copyright-holders have to prevent themselves from unauthorized of their work in order to ensure revenue streams and artistic integrity. The other group of opponents states that word ‘right’ is confusing and in that place they are proposing term digital restrictions management.
Consider the possibility that the digital rights management term is adequate to use for general description - it is a generic term describing many technologies which ensure unauthorized redistribution of digital content.

, Therefore, it is important to filter through various definitions until you find the one which actually refers to file sharing in the IT context.

Gather the information that identifies each source.,
Put the author and title of the source first.,
Indicate if the source is located in a “container.” Some sources are contained within other other works.,
List other contributors, if applicable.,
Provide the edition, version, volume, and number information, if present.,
Identify the publisher and date.,
List location information.,
Indicate whether the source has a second container.,
Format your works cited page.",How to Cite Sources in MLA Format2," The most recent set of MLA guidelines relies on a set of principles that will allow you to cite any type of source, rather than a set of separate rules for different media (book, website, film, interview, podcast, etc.). You will list the details, with a period between each. Include any information you can find on the work’s:Author(s)
Title
Version
Number
Publisher
Publication date
Location (where you found the source)

, List the author (if known) starting with the last name. Follow with the full title of the source. If there is no author, just begin with the title.For instance: Francis, John. Planetwalker.
Generally, the titles of things like songs, poems, and articles are given in quotation marks. Books, films, television series and other large works are italicized.
If a work has multiple authors, list them in the same order they are given in the source. Put only the first author in last name, first name order.

, This applies to both traditional and new media, so for simplicity the MLA now refers to the works sources are nested in as “containers.” If your source has a container, list it after the title. Examples of containers include:An article in a journal title (follow the article title in quotation marks with the journal title in italics: Jacobus, Francis. ""Early American Pottery Designs."" American Historical Review.)
A website hosting an article (follow the article title in quotation marks with the brief web address in italics: Miller, Frank. ""Gotham City at Night."" CNN.com.)
A poem in a poetry collection (list the title of the collection in italics after the title of the poem in quotation marks: Yeats, William Butler. ""Sailing to Byzantium."" Twentieth Century Poetry.)
A television series (list the television series in italics after the episode title in quotation marks: ""Hush."" Buffy the Vampire Slayer.)

, Some works may have contributors other than the primary author. For instance, a book may have a translator, editor or illustrator. If this applies to your work, give the other contributors after any details about containers.For example: Dostoevsky, Fyodor. Crime and Punishment. Translated by Constance Garnett.

, For example, an article in a journal will typically belong to a certain volume number, some books will be published in different edition numbers (first, second, third, etc.), and television episodes will be a certain number in an ordered series. If any of this information applies to your source, list it next.For example: Jacobus, Francis. ""Early American Pottery Designs."" American Historical Review. Vol. 6, no. 2.

, For traditional print sources, the publisher is the organization that issues the text. Other examples of publishers might include a television show’s production company, a scholarly organization that issues a journal, or a museum that hosts a webpage on modern art. Follow this information with the date of publication.For some media, like books or journal articles, the publication date may be given as a year. For example: Francis, John. Planetwalker. National Geographic Society, 2005.
For others, like newspaper articles, the full date is provided in date/month/year format. For example: Frankl, Jo. “Killer Bees are on the Rise.” Dallas Times. 14 June 2017.

, An MLA works cited entry should list information about where the information was found. For a source like a chapter in a book or a journal article, you could provide page numbers. If you are citing an artwork, list the museum it is located in. If you are citing a website, include the URL.The MLA now recommends including URLs for internet sources. If you are a student, your teacher may or may not ask for these.
You can include a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) instead of a URL, if one is provided.
For example: Jacobus, Francis. ""Early American Pottery Designs."" American Historical Review. Vol. 6, no. 2, 2016. DOI: 10.1326/history.1064107

, Some sources are nested within larger containers, particularly when it comes to ones accessed electronically. For instance, you might cite an article in a journal that is hosted on JSTOR, a television series episode you watched via Netflix, or see a music video that is hosted on YouTube. If this applies to your source, include the information at the end of the entry.For example: Jacobus, Francis. ""Early American Pottery Designs."" American Historical Review. Vol. 6, no. 2, 2016. JSTOR. DOI: 10.1326/history.1064107

, Put all of the source entries you have together in a page or section called “Works Cited.” List the sources in alphabetical order. Double space and use hanging indentation to make the list easier to read."

Place a reference next to each statement that you've cited.,
Place citations Author-date style.,
Place citations Notes-bibliography format.",How to Cite Sources in Chicago Manual of Style Format4," You do not want to forget to include a citation, as this could constitute plagiarism. Being accused of plagiarism, especially in a university or college setting, can get you a bad grade or even expelled.

, Write author last name and publication year in parentheses. If it is a direct quotation, add the page number after a comma. If the author is already mentioned in the statement, just put the year and page number in parentheses. If there are two authors, name them both with ""and"" in the middle. Use commas if there are more than two authors. Place the citation before a punctuation mark.


E.g. Leaving the ground in sod increases the organic matter of the soil by 15% in 10 years (Alison 1993).

, Add a superscript number at the end of the statement to denote which source it is referring to. Even if you refer to the same source multiple times, it gets a new superscript number every time. Start the superscript numbers from 1 every time you start a new page. You will need to list the source as footnote at the bottom of the page, as well as in the bibliography at the end of the paper.

,


Write speaker's full name as the beginning sentence of a footnote source. Place a comma after the name, and follow with the lecture title in quotation marks.
Next, in parentheses, include the word ""lecture,"" followed by the name of the institution, the city and state where it took place, and the date. Separate these with commas.
Months should not be abbreviated in the date (e.g. February 16, 2009).
Indent the first line of text for sources listed in the footnotes.

Use only the interviewee's last name when citing personal interviews.,
Eliminate the parenthetical citation if you use the last name in the sentence.,
Give the last name and page number for a print interview.,
Place short quotations from interviews in quotation marks.,
Format long quotations with a block quote.",How to Cite an Interview in MLA Format1," Personal interviews are interviews that you have conducted yourself. They have no page number because they have not been published in a book. When you cite a personal interview in the body of your paper, place only the author's last name in parentheses at the end of the sentence.Periods go after the parentheses. Think about the parenthetical citation as being part of the sentence. The period goes at the end of the whole sentence, so it goes after the parentheses.
The superintendent stated that there would be money in the budget for new computers (Jones).
Emily said, ""Training for the Olympics was the most challenging thing I have ever done"" (Walker).;
, MLA guidelines state that if you state the last name in the sentence, you do not need that same information in the parentheses. The parenthetical information complements, not repeats, the information provided in the sentence.Jones stated that there would be money in the budget for new computers.
Walker said, ""Training for the Olympics was the most challenging thing I have ever done.""
The difference between the examples in step 1 and step 2 is the way the last name is presented. In step 1, the last name is in the parenthetical citation because it does not appear in the sentence. In step 2, the last name appears in the sentence, so it does not need to be repeated in a parenthetical citation.
The reason why the last name must appear in either the sentence or the parenthetical citation is because the last name corresponds to the entry on the works cited page. Every citation must link directly to the works cited page.

, If your interview is printed in a book or other print source, provide the author's last name and the page number. You cite this just like you would any book or journal.Emily trained so hard that she bruised her foot and had to take a break (Walker 45).
Walker explained that she had to take a break from training after bruising her foot (45).
Remember, MLA does not put a comma between the last name and the page number in a parenthetical citation.

, Short quotations are no longer than four typed lines. When you cite short quotations from an interview, enclose the directly quoted words in quotation marks. Place the parentheses after the closing quotation mark but before the period.If a quotation ends with an exclamation point or a question mark, place it inside the quotation marks.
Dr. James Hill said, ""The virus starts by affecting the brain"" (56).
Dr. James Hill asked, ""If we can't find a cure, how will we save the human race?"" (57).

, Long quotations are longer than four typed lines. When you cite a direct quote from an interview this long, you must place it into a block quote. Do not put quotation marks around the quoted words. Instead, the words will be freestanding from the rest of the paragraph. Start the quotation on a new line after placing a colon after the lead-in text, instead of the comma like for short quotations. The entire quote will be indented one inch from the margin. The parentheses come after the punctuation, unlike in short quotations.Start your block quote like this: In an interview from 2002, Peter Jackson stated:
Punctuate the end of your block quote like this: Jackson said he will always keep making movies. (34-35)

Dates should be formatted with the numerical value for the day, followed by the three letter abbreviation for the date followed by a period, and then the numerical value for the year.

September is abbreviated using 4 letters: Sept.
For type of interview, state if it is a personal, telephone, or e-mail interview.
Example: Gambill, Mike. Telephone interview. 1 Apr. 2003.

, Published interviews include both print and broadcast outlets. If the interview is part of a larger work like a book or TV program, the title of the interview should be included in the citation, along with the medium of the interview (print, web, DVD). The title of the interview goes in quotation marks and the title of the book/TV show should go in italics.


For an interview published in a print source, start with the interviewee's last name, followed by a comma and then the first name. Add a period. Place the name of the interview in quotation marks, with a period inside the quotation marks. Next, list the name of the larger book or journal where the interview was published in italics.

"
Insert the author's last name in parentheses after the clause or quote being cited.",How to Cite an Author in MLA Format1," Include the relevant page numbers too. No comma necessary, punctuation goes outside the parentheses. Example: (Dickens 25).


If you can work the author's name into the text, you don't need to repeat it in the parenthetical citation; just include the page number. Example: As Dickens famously wrote, ... (25).
If the work in question has multiple authors, list them all in the parenthetical citation or in the text. Use a terminal comma if you're listing more than three authors. Example: (Jones, Barney, and Statham 89).
If you're citing multiple works by the same author, dispel any ambiguity by including an abbreviated version of the appropriate title in the parenthetical citation. State the author's name, followed by a comma, then the abbreviated title, then the page number. Example: (Ward, ""One Hundred Poems"" 42). If you can work the author or work's name into the text, there's no need to repeat that information in the parenthetical citation.;
