Don't forget about stretching, too!",How to Perform Aquatic Exercises in a Swim Spa," You can simply immerse yourself inside this lap pool filled with lukewarm water to sooth your tensed nerves and muscles. Swim spa provides you with a wonderful option of relaxing after a tiring and sweaty day.;
, You can control the speed and direction of the jets of water currents in order to perform swimming inside the pool. Free hand swimming promotes muscle movement of your entire body.

, By attaching resistance bands to rowing bars, you can perform strength exercises for your hands and legs.

, In some cases you can use ankle weights to achieve well-shaped thighs and calves. Strap your ankles with buoyancy cuffs to increase resistance without weight for better performance.

, Usage of foam buoyancy belts is useful for walking and running inside the pool, as these promotes toning up of abdominal muscles, support lower back and helps in correct posture.

, You can use the paddle wheel for rowing exercises to increase strength of your upper body.

, Certain swim exercises can also be performed using kick board, dumbbells and dragging balls.

, Perform some stretching exercises with the help of stretch belts and stretching machines.

Walk to the end of the board, watch the water behind you (this is optional), and turn your back to the water.,
Stand on the balls of your feet.

,
The first times you try this dive, start with your arms straight above your head and close to your ears.

,
Drop your arms to your sides while bending your knees.

,
At the same time, swing your arms back up to your ears and push off the board.,
Once in the air, you have three options for your body position - tuck, where your knees are tucked tightly to your chest, pike, where your body is bent at the hips and forms an ""L,"" and layout, where your body is completely straight.,
Unless you are very comfortable with this dive, do not attempt to tuck or pike.,
When you are completely vertical, (but upside-down over the water,) you're ready to twist.,
You should now be facing forward.,
Finished.

",How to Perform a Back Dive With a Half Twist,";
,,,, You don't want to jump straight up if you are on a recreational diving board, because then you will hit the board on your way down. If you are on a real diving board, then it works best if you jump straight up. However, you also don't want to jump straight back. Try jumping as high as you can in the air and about two to three feet back, depending on how tall you are.

, Layout is the easiest to twist, but it takes the most effort to complete the flip.

, For a layout, once you are in the air, tuck your chin to your chest and focus on pulling in your stomach muscles and straightening your back, helping your feet go over your head.

, If you are a lefty, snap your right arm down towards your left hip, keeping your left arm straight. As your arm turns, turn your hips. The turn will be completed. If you are a righty, snap your left arm down towards your right hip, keeping your right arm straight. As for lefties, your hips should turn with you arms and your turn will be completed.

, Make sure both arms are by your ears. You can untuck your chin now. Enter the water with your arms down, your toes pointed, and a big smile!

Go to your bathroom and fill your sink with water.,
Put your face in with eyes closed.,
Submerge yourself in a bathtub.,
Find a minimally treated water source.,
Submerge yourself and open your eyes.,
Practice adding time with your eyes open.,
Practice keeping your eyes open and seeing underwater.",How to Keep Eyes Open Under Water," You will want to ease in and start with tap water as opposed to pool water or open freshwater and saltwater. The sink should be full enough that you can submerge your face at least halfway. Avoid temperatures that shock or scald the skin with cold or hot to make the process easier.;
, Let your face adjust to the temperature and make sure you feel comfortable and calm when you are submerged underwater. If your nose is irritated at this stage, you should stop, as your eyes are likely to become more irritated by chlorine or cleaning byproducts from halogen-based cleaners. , Practice keeping your eyes open underwater as long as you can hold your breath. The temperature of the water should be moderate to cold, as in pools or the sink earlier. Continue practicing this until you have no trouble and don’t mind the irritation of exposing your eyes to water.

, Practice swimming in a pool that uses non-chlorine based cleaners or fresh water. While chlorine has not been conclusively found to cause eye irritation or corneal damage, it has been found to increase this activity in by-products of pool cleaners. Larger pools should be avoided, as they are most likely to use hypochlorite or elemental chlorine to maintain water quality. , If you are in fresh water, you should expect a minimum of irritation, but treated or saltwater is far more likely to contain irritants. While your eyes might become irritated and your corneas irritated, loss of visual acuity is unlikely without excessive time spent practicing. , Work at this, minding irritation to your eyes or exhaustion swimming until you can keep your eyes open underwater as long as you can hold your breath. Focus on increasing the time you keep your eyes open and focused underwater each time. Avoid deep or treacherous areas if you are not already a strong swimmer.

, You will likely want to spread this over several sessions to minimize risk of irritation if you are in a treated pool or saltwater, though it likely should not take too long before you are comfortable. You will want to practice in multiple water sources, which can vary considerably in their visibility and color. Avoid any unsanitary or stagnant water while practicing, as waterborne infections are a risk in small lakes and ponds.


You will need additional practice to parse visual information underwater accurately. Practice estimating distance with objects that you know are a certain depth or distance from you, and estimate how long it takes you to reach the object to get a sense of your ability to react to these things.
If you are diving, avoid going too deep in an unpressurized suit. Pressure changes during ascent can easily cause burst capillaries and damage to the ears. Make sure you can easily equalize the pressure when you dive with ease. "

Practice in cold water.,
Breathe slowly and deeply before taking in and holding a breath.,
Hold air in your nose.,
Release air slowly.,
Hold your breath for as long as you can while being still.,
Hold your breath while swimming, gradually increasing your speed.,
Lose weight.,
Do cardio.,
Increase your lung capacity.",How to Hold Your Breath While Swimming," Human exposure to cold water slows the heart rate,reducing oxygen consumption.;
, This will rid your lungs of poor-quality air before you attempt to hold your breath., If you have a tendency to breathe out through your nose to keep water from getting up it as you swim underwater, learn to hold the air there instead, as this will use oxygen more efficiently. Start by filling your lungs with air, pressing your tongue to the roof of your mouth to close the back of your throat, holding your breath, and lowering yourself straight down into the water; since the air in your nose will have no place to go, it will block the nostrils, making the water unable to enter. Once you’re comfortable with this, practice tilting your head underwater. The closer your head gets to being horizontal, the likelier the air bubbles are to pop out; however, there is quite a bit of leeway with this, so learn your boundaries. When you’re comfortable holding your head at the right angles, practice swimming that way. Only when your lungs begin to tire or you need to tilt your head further (such as when diving downward or doing a flip) you should blow air out your nose

, Jetting out a sudden burst of air makes you likelier to release more than necessary. Whenever you need to take the pressure off your lungs, release air slowly; this will provide relief without wasting your oxygen supply.

, The more you move, the more oxygen you consume, so get comfortable holding your breath for long periods while remaining motionless before trying to do it while swimming. Exhale slowly as necessary.

, Start by kicking off of the edge of the pool and allowing the momentum to carry you as you hold your breath. The next time, combine this momentum with your own efforts to build up your stamina. Finally, learn to build up your own momentum while holding your breath, which takes the most energy.

, If you’re serious about swimming, shed a few excess pounds to become a more efficient breather. The bulkier your fat stores, the more oxygen you will use., A strong heart with a low resting heart rate will use less oxygen. For fast results, do interval training, which is simply alternating between low- and high-intensity activity (ex. 10-minute stints of jogging or brisk walking interspersed by 2-minute sprints). This is not only an especially effective way to improve heart health and endurance, but also takes effect much faster than other forms of cardio., Larger lungs can hold more air and therefore more oxygen, making you able to hold your breath for longer.

Prepare.,
Get a good night's sleep now that you've prepared and have all the things you need.,
Wake up early.,
Eat a good breakfast.,
On the way there, reassure yourself.,
If the pool is unfamiliar, it's best to arrive as early as possible because you could get lost and waste time.,
Go to the locker rooms and change if you haven't already.

,
When you've gotten to the pool deck, find a suitable place to sit.,
Start your warm ups.,
After warm ups, just sit around or go to see your family and/or friends if you have the time.,
Now you can relax until your event.,
Swim your event.,
Repeat the last two steps for all of your events.

,
Now that your events are swam and over, you're done for the day!",How to Go to a Swim Meet Alone," You'll, of course, need to prepare first of all. Here's a list of some necessary items you'll need as well as some optional ones. You don't have to follow this list exactly; make adjustments as needed. Always bring an extra! This step should be done the night before the meet. (Or, if you're swimming on a Friday night, during the day.)


Your team suit. always bring your good meet suit so you can swim fast.






two or three towels. If you know you're going to a place where you have to sit on the floor, bring three; one to sit on, and another two to dry off and etc. You will need two to dry off with because when you get out of the pool you are very wet. If you want, you can still bring two or three even if you're not sitting on the ground.






A pair of goggles. Bring only one pair of goggles because usually your coach will have an extra pair.






Water/Energy Drinks. You can buy them at the meet, so it's optional. Gatorade and Powerade is good for energy drinks, but you can also use other brands. It is also a good thing to bring a bottle and fill it up at a water fountain. Or bring a pre-packed bottle of water.






Two swim caps. You should bring one team cap and one plain cap. Don't bring one that has another team's logo on it or you could get disqualified!






Something to kill boredom. Aside from talking with other people, you will get bored. Bring something like a notebook, a book, or a game like the Nintendo DS.






A sharpie or pen. This is the method most swimmers use to keep track of their events. If you've been to one with your team you may have used one before. If not, you'll have to use the sharpie or pen and write your event number, heat, and lane on your hand.






Directions and maps if you've never been to the pool before bringing directions to get there.






A camera. make sure you can take a picture with out using the flash






If you're going to an out-of-town meet and want to stay somewhere, be sure to pack your clothes and other necessary belongings.





;
, You probably are nervous, and that's completely normal! Try to sleep earlier than usual since your swim meet will likely be in the morning. If it's in the afternoon, it's still good to sleep well!

, If your warm-ups start at 7:30 AM, be sure to be there before 7:15 at the latest! That means waking up at 7 or earlier. Likewise, be sure to arrive at least 15 minutes before warm ups. You wouldn't want to miss check-in, would you?

, You might not be hungry or you might feel too worried to eat. Even if you're feeling like that, it's good to eat at least something, even a bagel or some cereal. Try some bagels, toast, or something along the line, even pretzel snacks! DO NOT EAT FAST FOOD!

, This could be about anything you might be anxious or worried about. Swim meets are tiring and stressful events, even if it's not your first meet alone. You can ask for emotional support from your family and/or friends. Don't worry!

, If it is, first find an entrance. If you see a parking lot with a lot of people and cars with people walking to the building, it is most likely your best bet. Go with the flow and follow where everybody's going.

,, This spot could be by yourself or you could ask a coach to let you sit with their team. They will most likely say yes. This is the easiest way, since the coach will probably help you out.

, You'll have to, of course, wait until the announcement. You can now warm up alone or with the team you've chosen. Just warm up like you usually do when you're practicing. Stretch if you like. This should, at the very least, take 15 minutes.

, The wisest thing to do, though, is to check your events. They may have not put up the heat sheets up yet, though. If not, wait until they do so. If so, go look up your events and write your event, heat, and lane number on your hand. You could have the coach you're with look it up for you.

, You can do anything that time permits. You should arrive about one to three heats before it starts. Try not to be nervous.

, If it's a longer event (200 yards/meters and up) remember to pace yourself. For 50s and 100s, sprint! Or just do whatever is best for you.

,, Cool down (if the pool has a warm up and cool down pool) and hit the locker rooms! Shower if you want, dress, and walk out with your head high. This meet might not be the best or it wasn't what you expected, but it was your first meet alone! Pat yourself on the back, hug yourself, and prepare for tomorrow if you have another meet day ahead of you.

Hit the pool, and start practicing your stroke.,
Do drills while you are practicing.,
Take breaks between practice sessions.,
Don't focus on speed, focus on the stroke.,
Correct your stroke.You should be rolling your body side to side.,
Come to the meets prepared, practice for a few days before the meet.,
Conserve you energy.,
Relax and swim.",How to Improve Your Freestyle While Swimming," Do this about 3 weeks before the meet. Your stroke's fluidity doesn't just come overnight. It takes some time. Be sure to taper yourself about a week before the meet.;
, Don't just swim laps of freestyle. That will tire out all of your muscles. Instead use fins, kickboards, floats or buoys. Have a friend or sibling time you.

, You risk damaging your muscles due to constant exertion. Take breaks to let your body recover and to restore normal oxygen levels.

, Even if you are really fast, you will be disqualified if you do not do the stroke correctly.


Try speed after mastering your stroke. One way to become faster is to wear a swim cap. Also, try to find smooth swim suits.

, For each pull, your body should roll to the side even though you are not breathing every single stroke.


Don't breathe after each stroke. That would make you slow.

, Avoid strenuous practice a day before as it would tire you.


If you are nervous it will make you swim slower so don't be nervous.

, Don't use it all on the first 50 or 100 meters (164.0 or 328.1 ft), especially if you are in a long race. If you are in a 50 then try your best to go fast the whole way because that is not a very long race. 100+ meters are harder so save up your energy.


Try to dive as far as you can, and dolphin kick as far as you can. Do not exceed 15 meters (or yards, depending on the pool). Try to also have a fast flip turn, and push off the wall as hard as you can. It will save you a lot of energy and time, and you could possibly drop time! The more strokes you take, the more you will surely waste energy.

, After all you are doing this because you enjoy swimming, don't let the pressure of winning overwhelm you.

"
"
Get a dive buddy.,
Breathe in as much air as you can before you hold your breath.

,
Let the air out slowly.

,
Relax before you go underwater and during the time you're underwater.

,
Continue this exercise about 5 to10 times.

,
Lie still in the water.

,
Breathe in 3 times as much air as possible.

,
Think about something to keep your mind off the fact that you're not breathing.

,
When you feel you need some fresh air, come up to surface.,
Sit down and breathe for a couple minutes to fill your lungs.

,
Don't do this again for at least 10 minutes, or you may feel dizzy, which could cause a headache.

Use the hug hold.,
Try the face-to-face hold.,
Practice the modified face-to-face hold.,
Use the pass hold.",How to Hold Your Baby in the Swimming Pool," The hug hold is the foundation of all the holds outlined in this article. Why? Because it is the hold that your baby feels most secure. Use it when getting in and out of the pool, use it while your baby gets acclimated to the water, and use it any time your baby needs a little TLC!;
, The face-to-face hold is one of the most versatile holds a parent or teacher can use. To perform this hold, simply place your hands under the baby's armpits with your thumbs wrapped around his/her shoulders. Not only is it great for kicking exercises, it also allows the teacher or parent to make sure that the baby's face is always out of the water, preventing any accidental facial immersions which can be dangerous if they happen repeatedly.

, This hold is performed like so: Simply place the infant or toddler on your chest while your hands are positioned just below the baby's knees. The advantage to this hold is that as you walk backwards around the pool, you can manipulate the child's legs as you cue: ""kick, kick, kick."" Now the baby/toddler gets both verbal and kinesthetic feedback which promotes learning skills. It is recommended that you alternate the face-to-face hold with the modified face-to-face hold, so that the infant-toddler learns what you want when you give him/her the cues.

, The pass hold is another really effective hold but it is also one that must be used with caution when utilizing it for kicking exercises. When you use the pass hold, you are holding the baby to your side, with your left hand under the child's left armpit and the right hand under the child's right armpit. While this can be a great position to have the child in to practice his/her kick, it is critical that you keep a constant eye on the child's mouth in relation to the water. Once again, you do not want a baby to have multiple accidental facial immersions because they could take in water, which can be dangerous, not to mention at the very least, it could create a bad experience and cause the baby to become upset and water-shy. It is really good to use this hold on two year olds who also have a noodle under their chins when performing kicking exercises. In addition, it is an awesome way to spot the baby (using a pass hold) for safety skill entries and drills (as seen video below).

Go into the draft with a plan, don't just wing it.Most money leagues have a salary cap of $260 on draft day.,
Get a season preview, preferably the most recent edition; most of the time they are weekly publications.

,
Rank players for each position -- do about the top 50 or so for each position, and more than that for pitchers, utility players, and corner men and middle infielders.,
Determine what players are really worth $40, what players are worth $20, and what players are the minimum ($1).,
Find the middle-priced guys that will help back up your highly-priced star players.

,
Decide if you are going to build your team around pitching or hitting, either strategy can bring you success, but ensure your team is strong in one or the other so you can take all available points in the categories.,
Think hard about in-season pickups, especially if pickups cost additional money in your league.

,
Look for ""the redeemers"": stars who disappoint for one year and fall in the fantasy draft.,
Make sure you are making good trades.,
Read ""Moneyball"" by Michael Lewis.,
Forget a lot of what you know about advanced baseball statistics.,
Prey on the ignorant owners.",How to Win Your Auction Style Fantasy Baseball League," How will you spend that money on the 23 positions available?;
,, On this list, have the most you are willing to pay for a player, and set yourself at that price. Don't go too hard after certain players because they play for your home team.

, $1 players are usually the backups, or subpar starters.

,, A well-balanced team may leave you smack dab in the middle of the standings, unable to dominate in any particular statistic.

,, Take the redeemers and reap the rewards.

,


If your league has minor league and minor league picks, use those in your trades.
Trade for categories you are in need of, not something you are already strong in.

, If you read the book, you realize Billy Beane is just running a de facto fantasy baseball team. Though you needn't overanalyze your fantasy team, general principles outlined in the book for picking players can be useful. Joe Shlabotnik's .350 batting average means diddly squat next year, because he can't walk and can't hit for power. Only fools would pick Shlabotnik high in next year's fantasy draft.

, Advanced statistics can be good as predictive tools, but in the end the league will likely be scored based upon more simplistic statistics.

, As the great P.T. Barnum once said, ""there's a sucker born every minute."",and this applies even in fantasy baseball leagues. You will almost surely have someone in your league who insists on buying high and selling low and riding every player's short-lived wave of success for all it's worth. Use them to purchase players with high upside for nominal prices.

, The middle layer has three real parts - a left siderail, a center real-time image and a right siderail - with the left siderail being a text-based representation and information collection of the direct center's field-of-view area.

, Not only will the left-hand siderail ticker tell you who's at bat, but it will also tell you the pitcher and his current pitching details (including name, jersey number, his pitching hand, ERA data, and total pitches (which are subdivided into strikes and balls) the batter details (including the name, jersey number, his position, game At-bat to hit ratio, batting average, total amount of home runs and total RBI's to date) has to face. Also the left ticker is the current score and additional details of exact breakdown of how each pitch fared in relation to the balls and strikes issue and a breakdown of each pitcher-batter matchup along with any substitutions the feed may have encountered.


Look for some of the additional details in the left siderail as to indicate what types of pitches are being thrown along with the speeds on these balls as they are being tracked on radar. Also, look for the result of the batting performance in this siderail.

This siderail contains data such as the radar gun speed on the pitch, the type of pitch that MLB believes could have been thrown due to curvature of the ball portrayed in the center area, along with the markup of how the balls and strikes were thrown along with the resultant to the player workup.
All pitches and information is tracked in almost realtime (with little delay after real pitch is thrown).
Look for the details that display times when runs are scored. This is denoted by the words ""in play. Runs scored"" along with how many runs were scored in that play.



, On top of the center tile looking like that of what the player may see when they step up to the plate (with some iconic backgrounds at the back wall of the stadium), this center tile of the center layer also shows the approximate location the ball was thrown, along with where the batter is most comfortable hitting.


The center of the middle layer of the screen provides a detailed look at the hitting location of the batter, along with his ""hot zones"" (where the player is good at batting). The hot-zones also show the approximate projected path of the thrown ball.

The zones where the player is great at hitting is indicated in a red coloring. The zone the player tends to miss pitches is indicated in blue, and when the player has a 50-50 chance of hitting this zone is indicated in white.


The background remains unclickable throughout the entire game.
The background of a spring training game is generically made, since the MLB doesn't have these illustrations to show it's users.
Read the results of each pitch thrown. Balls are denoted in green, strikes are denoted in red, and blue icons denote pitches thrown that resulted in a hit ball to somewhere that was on the playing field which is/was playable.
Understand about the makeup of what shirts these players are shown to wear are made to represent. The shirts the players on the screen are wearing, are supposed to look identical to the ones the player is wearing in real-life.

Look at what the player looks like. Along with the current jersey that look's like the current batter's jersey, you can also observe the side the player is currently batting from. For switch hitters though, this may not work too well, as the system isn't currently set up to monitor this situation very well and hasn't been fixed to show these batting position changes.



, You can also obtain other miscellaneous media about the game from either the ""Plays"", ""Video"", ""Field"" or ""Feed"" buttons above the boxscore.


No longer is the field information shown to the viewer as a default option. You must access the ""Field"" tab here instead to see field dimensions for that particular stadium's playing field as well as which players are on which bases (players on the bases appear with a darker colored brown background)
Look for the current box score along with the current lineup and stats for all players who have played a pivotal role in the lineup for both teams. If your current team is up to bat and you haven't yet touched the icons from the right side, you can switch between the two teams' lineups by clicking the appropriate team name icon button.
Watch the pitching situation's stats below the batting stats under the team stats chart. This will tell you the order each pitcher's has pitched in, along with their pitching stats. (No, only pitching stats are displayed in that displayed box below.
Look for additional pitch stats below the pitching information. These stats include ratios of pitches to strikes, along with groundouts to flyouts, total batters faced per pitcher, names of the umpires, weather at time of first pitch (temperature and weather conditions), wind speeds, time of first pitch (adjusted to locations time zone) and the name of the venue.

Look for the names of each of the umpires listed below the ""batters faced"" line of this screen, if you scroll this siderail down enough with your mouse's scroll wheel. This is no separate scrollbar for these siderails and scrolling on the page's scrollbars won't help the situation any- but will make this situation a lot worse.



, The bottom has quite a lot of information for the viewer to understand the game.

, However, here, you also get an icon that designates the status of the Manager's challenge. The yellow dot indicates if the manager still has a challenge that they can utilize to help their team better win and challenge the calls on the field.


The Manager's challenge icon is an almost new feature to professional baseball games. This new feature first began in the 2014 season, and can be changed, and there are so many ways these can be utilized, that these will not be provided here. The rules for this are written here for anyone to read, though this shouldn't be an everyday need when this page is needed to verify whether it was a contributable play that could be challenged.

, As each base fills up in color, these base indicates that there is someone on-base.

,, This information is also given to you from the bottom of the screen.

, This area shows a short animated clip of what happened. Although it displays this animated clip, the clips are only text-based and can fly in and change quickly, but change back out prior to the game continuing.

, Look for Gameday Mini and Classic Gameday to be shown to you, if this Gameday View is too powerful for your computer, or is way too appealing to look at that you can't stand looking at it for too long. Look for the ""Game Preview"" either before the game or during the game to see what's about to happen in the game as the game takes center stage. Classic Gameday has a lot fewer features and is less pleasing to the eye than the current rendition of the PC app, but there are still some who still like the less pleasant taste to this day.

, The footer of the MLB.com site includes such links as the MLB.com Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Legal Notices and a Contact Us button which don't tend to have much to-do with the game itself unless someone has a question about the MLB in general or a feature about the Gameday screen that isn't/wasn't answered already.

Get approval from your coach on whether or not you can taper.,
Don't waste your energy.,
Eat healthily.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Stick with your routine.,
Continue to stay in shape, even if you shouldn't overexert yourself.,
Stretch yourself out for the race.",How to Get the Most out of Your Taper," Most swimmers start tapering a week or two before Meet. Most coaches will know what's best for you.;
, After beginning your taper, you'll probably find yourself full of energy. Don't go out and run 10 miles (16 km) just because you feel like you can or stay up all night. Go to bed at your normal time and try not to exert yourself.

, Don't eat too much because since your practices will be getting easier, you won't burn calories as quickly. Snack on fruits, vegetables, and anything high in protein and carbs. Cut down on sugar and sweets.

, The reasons should be obvious. NO SODAS!!!!!

, Keep going through your days as you would without being on taper. This means eating around the same time and going to bed at a reasonable hour. Try not to do anything drastically different from your normal daily life.

, Don't spend the whole day just lounging around and watching t.v. Get up and stretch a little and do a couple crunches.

, If you always go to pool on a Friday, go! Even if you have to race later that afternoon. Do a couple of long swims and get yourself stretched out. Stretch again right before the race.

Conduct a visual inspection of your memorabilia.,
Authenticate your autographs.,
Compare your items to similar memorabilia found online.,
Have your items appraised by a memorabilia dealer.",How to Sell Baseball Memorabilia1," In order to properly assess the value of your memorabilia, you will need to know what condition the items are in. Check each individual item for visible wear, crease marks, scuffs, or anything else that may devalue it. Have a magnifying glass handy when inspecting smaller items or specific areas of larger memorabilia.;
, With fake autographs a major problem in the baseball memorabilia market, the only way to get top dollar for your signed material is to have your autographs authenticated. This is done by certified sports authentication companies. You can either send your items to them, or visit their booths at memorabilia shows. If the autograph is authentic, you will be given a certificate of authenticity you can use to verify to a potential buyer that your baseball autographs are the real deal.

, Visit auction sites and conduct keyword searches to get a sense of the going rate of a wide assortment of baseball memorabilia. Be as specific as possible when conducting your searches. Even the most minute detail can have a significant impact on the value of a piece of baseball memorabilia.

, No one knows more about the value of your 19th-century baseball or Rod Carew autograph than a certified memorabilia dealer. They can be found in cities and towns across the United States, and they are usually willing to offer quick and free appraisals to store patrons. For a nominal fee, most dealers will provide a more detailed assessment and might even offer to purchase your item on the spot!

"
"
Craft a detailed listing of each item.,
Post your listing.,
Set up a time for buyers to see the item(s).,
Finalize the sale.",How to Sell Baseball Memorabilia2," Be sure to include the following information:



What is it? Be specific here; there are several different types of baseball glove, so rather than say “glove,” indicate whether it is a catcher’s mitt, an outfielder’s glove, a batting glove, or some other type.

Who owned it? A baseball bat from the 1920s is valuable enough. A baseball bat from the 1920s that once belonged to Babe Ruth is a real treasure. If you have a piece of baseball memorabilia that was once the property of well-known player, you need to make sure it’s high in your listing.

What era is it from? If you don’t know the exact year your item is from, do your best to identify the era. A 1930s baseball has different value than a 1950s baseball, and the more information you can provide for prospective buyers, the more likely you are to generate a sale.

Is it autographed? Autographed memorabilia tends to hold its value better than non-autographed items. If you took the step to have your autograph authenticated, make sure you mention that in the listing. Most collectors prefer authenticated material, and some won’t even bother with any signed item that hasn’t been authenticated.

What condition is it in? Condition is everything for memorabilia collectors. Take multiple pictures of each item, detailing any flaws or imperfections that buyers should know about. Failing to disclose nicks, scratches, or scuffs can earn you a bad reputation in the memorabilia industry and make it difficult for you to sell anything.

How can interested parties contact you? Try to leave two ways in which buyers can get in touch with you. Some people prefer email to the phone, while others feel the opposite. More contact options will appeal to a larger cross-section of buyers.

, Use every avenue at your disposal, including newspapers, classified ad magazines, online buy-sell-and-trade sites, and message boards. Be willing to pay a little extra for prime listing placement, if it’s offered. A little investment can make a significant difference in the level of interest in your item.

, Make sure you leave enough time for the buyer to sufficiently inspect the item(s) and ask any questions he or she may have.

, Be polite and helpful as you close the transaction. You may be dealing with the buyer again down the road, so leaving a good impression is vital.

"
"
Set up your auction(s).,
Answer all questions promptly.,
Await payment.,
Ship the item.",How to Sell Baseball Memorabilia3," Use the item description(s) you wrote earlier, and be sure to include as many pictures as you can. You’ll need to decide on a number of settings:



Auction length: How long you want it to run. The top sites allow for short (1 to 3 day) or long (7 to 10 day) auctions, depending on how much of a hurry you’re in to sell your baseball items. The longer the auction, the greater the number of bids you’ll receive.

Starting price: The minimum bid for your item. Keeping the starting price low usually encourages a frenzy of early bids, since people see what they perceive to be a great deal and jump on it. Higher starting prices occasionally come with extra fees, so be wary.

“Buy it Now”: Bigger auction sites offer sellers the chance to set a price at which buyers can simply purchase the item outright. If a buyer selects “Buy it Now,” the auction ends automatically, and no more bids are accepted. This is a good option if you have a value in mind for your item and you suspect you can get someone to pay the set price.

Shipping price and options: How much will it cost to send your item? Do you plan to charge extra for insurance? Are there countries where you will not ship your item? Research your shipping options and include them with the item so bidders know how much more it will cost them to have it delivered.

, Auctions are time sensitive, so any inquiries you receive should be addressed as quickly as possible.

, Once the auction ends, the buyer will have a predetermined amount of time to pay. You will usually receive an email confirmation the moment the payment has been processed.

, Use great care when shipping, especially if it is an older piece of baseball memorabilia. Think about how you would want someone to protect a similar item if you were the recipient, and package it accordingly.

"
"
Protect your items.,
Find collectors who specialize in your items.,
Break out your bartering skills.",How to Sell Baseball Memorabilia4," You may be carrying them around with you for hours, so store them in bubble wrap, cardboard, cloth, or whatever else works. As you show them off, make sure to return them to their protective packaging.

, Memorabilia shows feature all kinds of dealers, and not all of them are going to be interested in what you have to sell. Ask vendors if they’re interested in what you have, and don’t be insulted if they decline. Many are looking for specific collectibles, and your items might not fit the bill.

, Rare are the moments when a memorabilia show vendor and a customer with items to sell reach immediate agreement on a price. If you walk into a show with little room for flexibility, it could be a long day for you. At the same time, do not settle for a vendor’s “best offer” just for the sake of coming away with something. Be courteous but firm. In most cases, you can find middle ground if you work at it.

Organize your cards.,
Take care of your cards.,
Consult a Beckett price guide.,
Determine which cards to sell.",How to Sell Baseball Cards1," To better determine the value of your cards, place them into three different categories. The first category is modern cards, or cards that were produced from the 1970s to the present. Then your next category is post-war cards, or cards produced between 1948 to 1969. Your last category of cards, if you have any of these, is call pre-war cards, or cards produced before WW2.If you find that many of your cards are modern cards, you might not get much money for them.
Modern cards were produced at the highest volume, so their value is very small.;
, Get soft sleeves for your modern cards. For your higher end cards, use a higher protection like a magnetized case. It is only worth selling cards that have been well cared for.


Any flaw in the card’s condition can decrease the overall worth of the card., Beckett is a company that tracks down the value of cards for serious card traders. To use their service, write down the baseball card's name, brand and number. This is not the player's number; it's the card's name. You can either use an online edition or find a hard copy to determine a rough estimate.For example, rookie Barry Bonds Topps card ID number is 12. The market has it listed for $12 USD.

, For many avid card collectors, many of the cards that are most valuable are also the most sentimental. Decide if certain cards are worth parting with before having them evaluated by a card trader or hobbyist shop.Check the condition of your Mickie Mantle card before departing with it. A card in poor condition may not be worth its sentimental value.

"
"
Present the card.,
Contact a local buyer.,
Get the word out online.,
Research and price your individual cards.,
Use a local buyer or a card buying company.",How to Sell Baseball Cards2," If you have a few cards that you want to sell individually, you’ll need to present the cards in a marketable fashion. Use a magnetic card holder to present the card as a higher end card. Wipe off any loose debris before placing the card in the holder.It is generally recommended to only sell cards individually if they are rare cards. The market usually buys cards in a collection.

, Any community has a “go-to” vintage cards buyer. Ask around in local sports stores that specialize in memorabilia as opposed to athletic gear. Tell them what type of cards you are trying to sell and ask if they or someone they know might be interested.

, Put ads out on Craigslist, Ebay or other websites where cards are sold. Newspapers and card collector magazine's classifieds are another possibility. Your best luck may be with Ebay since it has an active community who knows what to look for.


Be honest in your post. You’ll receive more inquiries if you take high quality pictures of the actual cards.
Make sure the spotlight is on your cards. If there is a highlighting feature, make use of it., Look through the online sellers who are also selling the exact same card and take note of what price they are selling it for. Put the exact price or lower when you sell them, or they will not sell.


Search the card's information before letting a dealer evaluate the card. For example, Bo Jackson's 1986 Topps ID number is 50T. The market online has the card worth about $140 USD in good condition.Google search the cards you have. For example, google ""Dock Ellis baseball card"". You'll find plenty of information and prices online for the exact card you have.

, If you want to avoid the hassle of selling your cards independently, there are services available to help. Many buyers may be suspicious if you do not have a selling history. It is good to research as much as you can before presenting your cards to a buyer."
"
Purchase presentation supplies.,
Present your cards.,
Research similar collections.,
Determine a starting price.",How to Sell Baseball Cards3," A great way to showcase a larger collection of hand selected cards is by organizing them in a binder. Purchase a binder and pocket protection pages. You will be able to find the pocket protectors online or at your local hobby store.

, Organize your baseball cards by brand and year. Start with the oldest, most valuable cards, and move to the newer, less valuable cards.

, Decide what the collection is worth as a whole. You may find it helpful to look for similar collections online, to see what they're charging. Take a moment to jot down every card in the collection in the order you are presenting them in. This will help you understand the worth, and inform the buyers of what exactly they are purchasing., Always ask for a price a little higher than what they are really worth. This will open up a negotiation and barter between you and the buyer. Negotiate the best deal you can for your collection. Collect payment before sending your card collection out or having it collected if completing the transaction online.


A secure way of paying and receiving payment online is a service like PayPal."

, You will need Soda or juice for the kids, and various kinds of beer/soda/other alcohol/ for the adults. If you buy many packs of drinks and food, many stores will give you a discount for all the stuff you're buying.

, Also, lay out LOTS of team gear on the walls.

, Do you want people coming into your home to see soda cans on the floor, or piles of laundry? Of course not! Run the vacuum, CLEAN THE TV SCREEN! Put a tablecloth to avoid food messes.

, The world series is always on FOX. And for each game they have long pregame shows. That will also give your invitees to fill up on food before the big game!

Learn the basics of the rules of the game.,
Look for ways your team can get outs.,
Ask questions.,
Choose sides.,
Learn the lingo.,
Play your own game.,
Take a snack break.,
Read the line score.,
Give the game a chance.",How to Enjoy Watching Baseball Games1," Boredom will certainly set in if you have no idea what you are looking at. Knowing a few of the ins and outs of the baseball game will help keep you interested in what is going on.Baseball games last for nine innings, consisting of 2 halves, so that both teams get to bat in each inning. Each half is ended when the defensive team on the field gets three outs.
A batter can be walked to first base if the pitcher throws four balls before he throws three strikes.
The batting line-up remains the same throughout the game, so you can always know when your favorite player is coming up. He will also be in the batter’s circle warming up when the player before him is at bat.
Runs are scored when a player rounds all the based and touches home plate without being tagged out.;
, It can seem like there is less to be excited about when your team is on the field in the defensive position instead of batting and scoring. When the team you are rooting for has taken the field, you're still rooting for them. You want them to get their three outs as quickly as possible.


Outs can be achieved by the pitcher throwing three strikes and the batter striking out, a defensive player catching a fly ball, or a player being tagged by a defensive player holding the ball.
The defensive player with the ball in hand can also force an out by tagging the bag before the runner gets there if there are runners on every base behind the bag they are tagging. Force outs also apply to tagging first base before the batter reaches it.

, You are likely watching the game with some baseball fans. A true fan loves nothing more than sharing their infinite knowledge of the game. They probably have some nifty stories, they can explain what is happening on the field and they can point out some little idiosyncrasies certain players have, which you may have never noticed on your own., It can feel pretty senseless to watch a game if you have no investment in the outcome. Choose a team to root for. Either one will do. You can join your friends and root for their favorite team, or engage in a little playful banter by rooting against them.

, It could seem like people are speaking a different language when they use baseball terminology and slang. Get in on the game and learn some of the lingo to talk shop with your friends. There is a lot of lingo out there, but here are a few common terms to get you started.A “long out” is a fly ball which threatens to be hit out of the park, but is caught at the last second.
A “one-two-three” or “three up, three down” refers to getting all three outs on the first three batters.
ERA stands for earned run average, referring to how many earned runs a pitcher allows in the game. This is a common stat that fans will track.
RBI stands for run batted in and is another common tracking stat. This is the credit given to the batter for hitting the ball which allows another runner to make it to home plate to score a run.
The “clean up hitter” is often fourth in the lineup and is considered the strongest batter who can hopefully hit a “grand slam” when the “bases are loaded” with a player on every base and he hits a “home run” bringing all the players home to score, himself included.

, There are several games you can play for money, bragging rights or sips of beer. Playing a game based on what is happening on the field will have you that much more invested in the baseball game, while enjoying your own friendly competition.


Pass the Hat is played by everyone putting a dollar or quarter into a hat. One person holds it for each at bat. When the batter changes, the hat gets passed to another person. The person holding the hat on the third out wins the pot, and everyone antes up again.
Ground Ball vs. Fly Ball is pretty self-explanatory. You guess whether the batter is going to hit a ground or fly ball. If you guess wrong, you have to drink. If the batter strikes out everyone drinks. If he walks, no one drinks.

, No good baseball gathering is complete without a spread of good all-American snack food. Take a break from the game, sneak some chips and dip, fire up a hot dog and crack open a soda. Have a good chat with a friend around the snack table, and you’ll be refreshed and ready to return to the game., If you have lost track of the game, the line score can get you back up to speed. It will be displayed in a box on the screen and keep you posted on the runs, hits, score and innings.The teams are listed on the far left of the score line.
Reading from left to right, the hits and runs scored are listed below the inning numbers running along the top of the grid. They are designated by the letters “H” and “R.”
The boxes following the ninth inning column are the sum of the hits and runs for the game, letting you know who is in the lead.

, Even if baseball isn’t your passion, continuing to watch games and track a team will draw you in. You will start to learn the lingo and the players, have a better understanding of the strategies, and become more invested in your team.


Gather some buddies and try watching the games for a full season. You just may learn to love baseball.

Know the current plays and coach.,
Get team items like jerseys, posters, and Ravens apparel.,
Watch the games.,
Go to M&T Bank Stadium and watch a game.,
The Ravens are known for having one of the most loyal fan bases in the entire NFL.",How to Be a Baltimore Ravens Fan," The glory of the moment is now and it is the first step to being a Ravens fan. The glory players are Joe Flacco, Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Terrell Suggs, and Ray Rice.;
, They are on eBay, NFL.com, and at the local store (If you live around Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania). This is what true Ravens fans do.

, You can watch on TV or live. The biggest ones are prime time and against fellow AFC North teams (for an example, the Pittsburgh Steelers). Usually if you are local all the games are on CBS or Fox. If you are not local, just catch the prime-time games. Just know what you are watching and understand the game of football.

, It is cold there in the winter so try to catch one in the opening part of the season. An alternative is to check if the Ravens are coming near you (If you don't live in the Baltimore area) and go to that game. If you do this then you are a true Ravens fan.

, Embrace that. Be rabid. Wear your jersey even if it's ripped up and has pit stains and the Ravens are 0-9. If you see another Ravens fan, yell to them, especially outside Baltimore.

Dress for the occasion.,
Explore the stadium.,
Soak up the sun, or soak in the breeze and appreciate the great outdoors.,
Indulge in junk food.,
Keep an eye out for different players’ little idiosyncrasies.,
Pick a favorite player.,
Join the crowd.",How to Enjoy Watching Baseball Games2," You’re going to enjoy the game much more if you are comfortable. Start by wearing comfortable shoes. Don’t worry about dressing up, games are casual affairs. Check the weather. Decide to layer if it is going to get cold and wear sunscreen if your going to be exposed to the sun all day.Sport a team shirt if you really want to get into the game, but avoid the visiting team’s jersey if you don’t want to be picked on by drunk strangers.

, Baseball stadiums are unique and offer many different forms of entertainment from historic landmarks to wild clubs. Find out what is special about the stadium you are visiting. Take a walk to take a break from the game and see what you can find.


The Cleveland at Marlins Park in Miami is not just a club, it’s a party, complete with a bar and a swimming pool. Bring your trunks.In Chicago, you can have a view of the stadium and the game when you buy tickets to one of the rooftops of the surrounding apartment buildings., One of the great things about being at a baseball game is being outside with a group of friends. You could be sitting at home on your own, but instead you are out in what is hopefully a beautiful afternoon or a nice evening.

, Games generally take about three hours. Throw in the time it took you to get there and the time it will take to get out and you’re looking at a good chunk of your day. Have fun and get some snacks to keep you going.Be a kid again and grab some cotton candy from the nearest vendor.
Eat out of a baseball hat. You can order plastic baseball hats filled with nachos or ice cream. As a bonus, it’s a fun souvenir to take home.
Try the stadium special you won’t find anywhere else. The D-Bat Dog is an 18 inch corndog served at Chase Field. Target field serves up the Brat Dog, which is a brat stuffed with a hot dog and wrapped in bacon. Miller Park Inside the Park Nachos are actually beef and beans rolled in crushed Doritos and deep-fried.
Feel free to throw your peanut shells on the floor. This is one place where you are allowed to make a huge mess, so go for it.

, There is a lot of superstition in baseball. Some you may not see, like a player wearing their underwear inside out, or, in Jason Giambi’s case, a magic golden thong with a flaming waistband. On the other hand, if you are watching closely, some players have rituals and little quirks that can be entertaining and fun once you catch on to them.Wade Boggs of the Boston red Sox would write “chai” in the batters box every time he approached the plate.
Kevin Rhomberg of the Cleveland Indians always tagged the player back who tagged him out.
Luis Valbuena of the Chicago Cubs flips his bat instead of throwing it when he gets a hit.Koji Uehara is a fan favorite spreading unabashed joy through hard-hitting high fives every time he returns to the dugout. Get out of the way or put your hand in the air!, It doesn’t matter who or why. Maybe you think he has a funny name. Maybe all the fans do a weird chant when it’s his turn to bat. If you choose player to follow, it will help draw you back into the game when he bats or makes a play.

, A large part of going to the game is being a part of the crowd. Fans all work together to create the sport wave, sing the National Anthem, and stretch during the seventh inning. Get in the game with the rest of the fans. Cheer, wave, sing and stretch it out!

Make copies of the grid on your copier or printer copier for each participant.,
Decide how winners will be determined.,
Enjoy the game and pay out the pot as decided.

",How to Set up a Football Pool," In some American States, laws are in place banning any form of gambling, including pools that result in no profit to the organizer. If this is the case, you won't be able to do this for financial reward, or involving money.


If playing for money is not permitted, play for something else, such as simply winning and being able to brag! It can still be a good excuse for a party.;
, Draw a grid on thick cardboard that consists of 10 rows across and 10 columns high. Use a ruler to keep it straight. Make sure there is adequate space for names or initials in each of the squares.


Alternately, print off a football pool grid. These can be found doing an online search (look for ""printable football grid"" to find one) and can be printed off on an 8-1/2 inch x 11 inch (21.5cm x 27.9cm) piece of paper, consisting of 100 squares.

, Down one side of the grid, write one team's name, and write the other team's name across the top of the grid.

, You'll need to decide how much to charge per square and how to pay out the pot.


Pricing the squares: A usual price is $1.00 per square, for a total pot of $100.00.
Paying out the pot: The most common way is to pay something at the end of each quarter. You can decide what percent of the pot will be paid out each time. For example, 25 percent after the 1st quarter, 25 percent after the 2nd quarter and so on until 100 percent of the pot is paid out. Large Super Bowl Pools cost can $100 per square,(for a total pot of $10,000) and pay $100 for every score change. For example, at the beginning of the game, the person with 0-0 gets $100. If the first score is a touchdown, then the person with the correct 6-0 gets $100. If the PAT is good, then the person with 7-0 gets $100, and so on. You can pay $500 for the first three quarter scores, then pay the handsome balance to the person with the correct final score.

, ""Sell"" squares on the grid until all 100 squares are filled in with the buyer's name. Buyers can purchase multiple squares.

, Create 10 small squares of paper and then write one number (zero thru nine) on each piece of paper. Fold the 10 squares and put them into something to draw from, like a hat or an ice cream container.


Choose somebody to draw one number at a time.
As the numbers are drawn out, fill them in across the top, starting from left to right.
Fold them back up and do the same for the left side, top to bottom.
When finished, the numbers will be in random order across and down the grid.

, Place the original grid where everyone can see it, especially if you're having a party, and have someone responsible for keeping it updated.

, A very common way is to use the ""last digit"" method. Basically, take the last digits of each team's score and find where those numbers intersect on the grid. For example, if the final score is A's 19 and F's 12, line up the 9 from the 19 of the A's and the 2 from the F's side. The intersecting square when you draw your fingers down and across from 9 and 2 is the winner. (This is the exact same method as used for reading a street map.)

, A properly fitting bicycle will measure 1-2 inches / 2.5–5cm longer than the inseam measurement. Standing flat on the ground, the bar should almost touch the crotch.

, This proper seat measurement should be 1-2 inches/ 2.5–5cm shorter than the inseam measurement. The leg should almost be fully extended, without locking the knee.

, An alternative seat measurement may be performed by the rider sitting on the bike and pedaling until one foot can extend almost as far as it is able to go.

Bring emergency items.",How to Ride a Fat Bike," Before you get a fat bike, you'll need to make sure that the bike you get is designed to deal with biking on the intended terrain. Decide if you'll be taking paved paths down trails or whether you'll be going offroad and have to bike over larger rocks and stones. If you are planning on biking over hazardous winter terrain, make sure that you get a bike that's durable enough to handle it like a mid to top tier bike.If you are biking down paved paths or easy trails, you can get a beginner or mid-tier bike.
If you don't plan on going on trails at all and will be biking on flat land or the bike is for someone younger, consider getting an affordable bike.;
, Fat bikes can range in cost from around $100 to over $3,000. Evaluate your biking skill. If you're a beginner, consider buying a cheaper bike so that you can determine if you like riding fat bikes. If you're a veteran mountain biker and are taking on harder trails and more hazardous terrain, consider upgrading to a more durable model. You can pick up your fat bike at bike and outdoor stores, online, or at select department stores.


Affordable models range from $100 to $900.
Mid-range models range from $1000 to $2000.
High-end bikes cost anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000., If you have a bike shop near you, you can test out different fat bikes and determine which brands will suit your needs the best. Search online for bike shops in your area and give them a call to see if they have fat bikes that you can try out. Each bike will handle and weigh differently, so take note of which ones you like before making your final decision.


Common starter bikes include the Mongoose Massif, the Gravity Deadeye Monster, and the Framed Minnesota.Mid-range bikes include the Norco Bigfoot, the On-One Fun Fatty, and the Surly Pugsley.High-end bikes include the Sarma Shaman and the Salsa Bucksaw.

, Fat bikes typically have a tire pressure of 8-10 PSI. A lower PSI allows the tires to absorb some of the shock and increases the surface area of your tires to the ground. This is what makes fat bikes superior when riding over bumpy terrain.


Do not overfill your tires with air.
If you notice that the tire pressure is too high, release some of the pressure from your tires before riding it., Stay low and absorb the bumps you go over as you turn. Drop your outside foot in a relaxed state and point your inside knee into the apex of the turn while turning your handlebars into the direction you want to turn. Lean the bike by cranking the handlebars as you turn. Practice by taking fast turns on flat ground before trying it on a hill or trail. It may seem counter-intuitive to take hard turns while on snow, but being decisive will prevent you from wiping out.Exaggerate everything you'd do on flat land when riding down a snowy path.
Your back tire against the snow will help balance you and prevent you from falling.

, The only way to become acclimated to riding your fat bike in the snow is to practice. Start slowly, and start to build speed over time. Practice riding in a safe, level area with soft snow, like a parking lot or lawn. Practice gaining your balance on the slippery ground and try to get more used to the physics of the bike.Once you feel more comfortable riding in the snow, practice turning and riding your fat bike fast.


Soft snow will help break your fall and minimize the potential for injury.

, Breaking your fall on a fat bike is different than breaking your fall while you run or jog. Instinctively, you may want to put out your arm to break the fall, but on a fat bike, this increases the likelihood of a broken limb. When falling on your side, hold and tuck your knee into the bike on the side that you're falling. This allows the handlebar and pedal to take the brunt of the impact.When going over the handlebars, tuck in your chin and upper body into a ball and try to roll. Avoid landing on your head, neck, or chest as these are the most vulnerable places on your body., When traveling fast down a snowy path, it's important that you keep your eye out for potential obstructions in the road ahead. Keep your eyes on the trail in front of you and avoid things like large rocks, tree branches, tight turns, or cliffs. If you do notice an obstruction, make sure that there is a safe path around it and slow down your speed. Turn well in advance, and if you have to be ready to come to a full stop.Never ride with headphones or an earpiece in. Use your vision and your hearing to anticipate potential dangers as you ride.Try to minimize distractions as much as possible.

, Riding a bike in snowy conditions can sometimes be hazardous, especially if you don't bring the right gear. Make sure to wear a helmet that can cover the front of your face. If you don't have one, then you can wear goggles and a facemask with a regular helmet instead. Get a helmet that is specifically designed for mountain biking, as these models often have additional head and neck protection for riders.Popular mountain bike helmets range anywhere from $40 to $200 in cost on average., You'll need knee pads and high-quality gloves to protect your hands from the blistering cold. Other pieces of equipment that you should get include shin guards and elbow pads in case you fall while riding.Wearing this gear will help protect your body if you crash and will help insulate it from the cold.

, It's important that you layer your clothes to prevent hypothermia while you bike. Typically bikers will wear a thermal protective underlayer close to their skin made of a synthetic material like polyester. This fabric will allow your body to breathe while keeping you warm. On top of that layer, you should wear sweatshirts, vests, or pullovers. The final layer, or protective layer, should be a larger water resistant shell, like a heavy snow jacket, that protects you from the elements. You can purchase these clothes at some department stores and a variety of winter sport and activity stores.Popular winter brands include Campmor, Land's End, L.L. Bean, and Sierra Trading Post., Don't choose a path that is above your current skill level. While it's productive to challenge yourself, using a trail that's more advanced than your skill could get you hurt. Look at each trail and the difficulty that's designated for it before starting to bike. Talk to someone that manages the trails and talk to them about your experience level. Ask them which trail is best for you.


You can say something like ""I'm new to mountain biking. Can you tell me which trail would be best for a novice like me?""

, You may forget that you're thirsty as you ride, but it's important that you stay hydrated when you're physically active. When biking in cold areas, make sure to pack warm water that is well-insulated to prevent it from freezing. Stock up on fluids before and after you take a long trip, especially at higher elevations. You can keep your water warm by putting hot water in a thermos or insulated mug with a cover., It's important to keep emergency items when taking longer trails that will last the day. Essential things that you should pack include a compass, cell phone, and basic first aid kit in a backpack that you bring with you. Also, remember to bring bike tools like hex key that you can use to replace bike parts in case it breaks down while you're on the trail."

Honor the greats.,
Know the key players now.,
Say “How bout them Cowboys?” to fellow fans.,
Trash the Rivals.,
Stick with them through thick and thin.,
Visit the Cowboys.",How to Be a Dallas Cowboys Fan," The Dallas Cowboys have a rich NFL history and many of the sports’ greats have played on this team. For example, “Dandy” Don Meredith, who passed away at age 72 on Dec. 5, 2010, played for the Cowboys from 1960-1968 and was an early star of the franchise. He became starting quarterback in 1965, but his greatest legacy comes from being one of the three original members of the Monday Night Football on-air broadcast team. He retired in 1984 and is remembered as one of the most popular sports broadcasters. The full history of great past Cowboys can take pages to get through. Instead, here is a list of people to familiarize yourself with:


Emmitt Smith - Running Back, 1990-2002
Troy Aikman - Quarterback, 1989-2000
Michael Irvin - Wide Receiver, 1988-1999
Tony Dorsett - Running Back, 1977-1987
Roger Staubach - Quarterback, 1969-1979
Bob Hayes - Wide Receiver, 1965-1975
Mel Renfro - Defensive Back, 1964-1978
Rayfield Wright - Offensive Tackle, 1967-1979
Bob Lilly - Defensive Tackle Deluxe, 1961-1975
Deion Sanders - Defensive Back, 1995-1999;
, There is a lot to learn about Cowboys history, but before that, familiarize yourself with the big names on the current Cowboys roster. This way, you are ready to cheer like a pro for the next game. To start, there is quarterback Tony Romo, who holds the fourth highest passer rating in NFL history. Tight End Jason Witten is considered to be one of the best currently playing, and the Cowboys have one of the best young receivers in the game in Dez Bryant.

, There are a lot of things involved in behaving like a Cowboys fan, such as wearing team colors (royal blue and silver), but this phrase is tradition. Said after a win, the phrase “How bout them Cowboys” is generally attributed to Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson. Be careful--while this phrase is beloved by fans, it has been used by rivals to insult the Cowboys in their weaker moments.

, Poking fun at rivals is a must. The Dallas Cowboys hate on and are hated by fans of many teams, but the following are the most significant:


Washington Redskins. This rivalry goes as far back as the first meeting between the two teams in 1960, though the Cowboys have been fairly dominant in recent history, going 14-7 since 2000. Cowboys lead the all-time series 59-40.
Philadelphia Eagles. Cowboys and Eagles fans are a volatile blend. This series is full of close games and bitter post-season match-ups. Cowboys lead 55-43.
New York Giants. The Cowboys also lead the all-time series (55-40), with the Giants and picked up one of their 4 wins this season on Nov. 14th in NY. However, the Giants bested the Cowboys in their only playoff meeting in 2007. That is but one of the reasons this rivalry has become even more bitter in recent history.
There are more rivalries to get immersed in, but knowing these three is essential.

, It’s the hallmark of any true fan: being there when times are rough. It’s easy to be a fan when a team is winning, but it is when things go south that a team needs its fans the most. As a fan, you are entitled to criticize and complain about the Cowboys if you feel something is being done wrong. However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t defend the Cowboys to rival fans who seek to take advantage of a weak moment by making jokes at the Cowboys’ expense. And as with any “rough patch,” it will pass, and there can still be some classic moments along the way (like the thrilling Dec. 5 38-35 win over the Indianapolis Colts in overtime, in which the Cowboys pulled it together for a dramatic victory to prove doubters wrong.

, Tickets to see Dallas games are expensive, but a true fan can usually find a way around that problem.

Find a safe route to school.,
Carry a mobile phone with you if you have one.,
Follow all traffic laws.,
Confirm with a parent that you are riding on a bike to school.,
Ride to school following the route that you chose in the first step!",How to Ride your Bike to School Safely," Use Google Maps and find two bicycle friendly routes to your school. One should be the one you take most of the time and the second one should be a backup. If you already know a route to your school and it is possible to travel it on a bike, use it. (You should still find an alternate route in case the first route becomes obstructed or impassable.) Carry a printout of both routes while riding the bike to school.;
, If you ever get lost, you will be able to contact your parents, the school, etc. Program the appropriate numbers into it.

, It is possible for a cyclist to be issued a ticket. It is illegal almost everywhere to operate your bike on a pavement unless it is marked for that purpose. You are generally also required by law to make to appropriate hand signals when turning and stopping.

, Make sure they know the route that you will be taking as your alternate route.

, Stay safe and have fun!

Try riding one-handed with each hand.,
Once you get the hang of riding one handed, try taking your hands off of the handlebars for a few seconds at a time.,
When you're ready to give it a try, find somewhere with lots of open space that slopes downhill slightly.,
Keep your center of gravity low.,
Take your hands off of the handlebars, but only lift them about one inch above the handlebars at first because then you can easily regain control of the bike by grabbing the handlebars if necessary.

,
Practice going in straight lines, eventually you will become comfortable enough to try making turns by leaning.

,
To turn while riding no-handed, move your lower body in the direction you want to turn, but try to keep a grip on the bike with your knees and keep your upper body straight.",How to Ride No Handed on a Bike," You may find that one hand is easier to ride with than the other. If you practice enough it will become easier.;
, Keep them close so you can grab the bars again and not fall if you get nervous.

, This will let you coast downhill and maintain your speed without pedaling.

, Focus your weight on the seat and pedals before taking your hands off the handlebars.

,,, Pointing your knees in the direction you wish to turn helps.

Invite your family and friends, even your colleagues.,
Clean the house.,
Set up the house.,
Go shopping for food and beverages.,
Organize the food layout.,
Make your guests feel at home when they arrive.,
Use half time as the lunch break.,
Recruit people to help you clean or tidy the place after the game.",How to Throw a Super Bowl Party," The more, the merrier, as long as everyone can see the television clearly and you have enough bathrooms. There is a lot of easy ways to invite them. One good way is to send a mass picture text. What ever way you invite, just make sure it's easy for them to see all the details and address of the party. Estimate how many people will end up sitting around your TV and if seating is going to be an issue, ask your friends and neighbors if you can borrow some ahead of the event, especially if they're coming along too. Another idea is to use smaller TVs in spaces that might be too awkward to see the big screen TV from. This will ensure that wherever guests end up spilling into, they can always keep an eye on the game as it progresses.


Create a budget for your party. If you think funding the party on your own is too much to handle, include with your invitation a request that guests RSVP and bring food or drink to share. When the RSVP call comes through, you have the opportunity to request a specific item type (appetizer, dessert, beverages) and you'll decrease the odds of over-representing a particular item or dish.;
, Ensure that the house is in a decent condition when your guests arrive. Welcoming your guests into a pigsty with laundry on the floor or empty soda cans isn't conducive to a party atmosphere! Get the whole household involved in cleaning up to make light work of it. If it's really awful, at least clean the TV room, kitchen, and bathroom, and shut the doors to all other rooms. Don't wait until the last minute!


If you're living in an area under snow, ensure that there is plenty of space for boots, jackets, and cold weather accessories to be placed near the front door.

Clear ice and snow from the path to your house if relevant. Guests who slip over won't be in a merry mood and may even need medical attention.

, Lay out any tables you'll need, bring along chairs, and bring out the barbecue set. Cover the tables with tablecloths (choose ones that are easy to remove stains from) and tuck several garbage bags somewhere close to the table for easy access. When creating drink and food space, bear in mind where people will stand so that you won't have them blocking the TV view.


Decorate. Put up decorations or team names and colors. If your hometown or other favorite team is playing, go all out and decorate the front door entrance way, the mailbox, and even consider dressing up in your team colors.
If you're going to have guests who are rooting for different teams, establish an imaginary line (or for fun, ""draw"" one with masking tape) down the center of the room. Decorate each side in one team's colors.
If you know you're going to have non-fan guests, consider setting aside a quiet area somewhere else in the house where they can congregate and chat, rest, or watch something they'd prefer to see. This might also be helpful for very young children and those caring for them.

, If you wish, you can ask people to pitch in either with money or to bring food to the house. Food can include chips and dip, picnic or barbecue items like hamburgers and hot dogs, or order food in advance, like pizza or super-long deli sandwiches.


Make food football themed where possible.
Plan for some homemade baked or dessert treats with football decorations.
Beverages include soda and juice for kids and non-drinkers, and various kinds of beer for adults. Usually stores will have Super Bowl specials, for example a 2 for 1 deal or discounts or sales for the week, so take advantage of these.
Don't forget to account for any special dietary needs or preferences (for example, sugar-free treats for diabetics and meat-free choices for vegetarians).

, The best advice is – don't fuss overly much. This is a mates and fans party, and the idea is that everyone is free to help themselves and enjoy the informality of the occasion. You don't need to choose which chips you'll open first; just open everything and put some of each in large bowls, choosing the amount of bowls depending on how many people are coming over for the game. Place the drinks in coolers or plastic bins first, then dump ice over them. Ensure that there are places to set down the hot food when it comes out, and leave plates, cutlery, napkins, and seasoning out for everyone to help themselves to.


The more food that can be cooked in advance, the better, so that everyone is freed up from too much kitchen time.

, Talk about the game while the pre-show is going on. Make bets to see who thinks which team is going to win. Add side bets, for example, point spreads and the amount of yards the MVP (most valuable player) ran. Talk about how you think the whole season went generally.


Pour drinks at the beginning if wished but be sure to let guests know where the drinks are and that they're welcome to keep helping themselves at any time throughout the party. A good host will also keep checking the supply level of the drinks and restocking as needed.
Have everyone write down who they think will win and what the final score will be before the game starts. Award a silly prize, like a big football piñata, to the person who comes the closest.
If you want a drinking game, work out the triggers in advance with everyone presents, such as certain phrases or plays made. Read How to make a sports drinking game for more ideas.

, Super Bowl commercials are renowned for being the best and highest paid commercials played on TV (indeed it is said that 10 million people tune in for this aspect alone),so you might want to make it easy for guests to hang about with plates of food. For those not so excited by watching ads, use half time to discuss the game progression and other things. If there are kids around, spend a little time asking them what they think of the game so far and explaining anything to them that might not understand.


Organize in advance who will be responsible for popping out of the room to heat up the snack foods, barbecue, or whatever you've decided to serve for lunch. To make it fair, you might like to roster people to take turns unless the chef really doesn't mind missing part of the game.
Make sure the dishwasher is clear at the beginning of the game. You can quickly fill it at the end of break to help lessen the cleaning up needed later. Alternatively, use disposable items and there will be less mess to contend with.

, Ask people if they want to take any of the leftovers of the food and drinks. After everyone leaves, do some very light cleaning and then relax!

, Go too slow and you will bounce your way down the stairs. Too fast and you're likely to end up airborne. Ideally, you should be going about jogging speed.

,, This moves your center of gravity rearward, making for a smoother and safer ride.

, If you need them, apply your brakes slowly and softly; otherwise you will take an alternate route to the bottom of the stairs via a flight over your handlebars.

,, Get back, relax, look past the bottom of the stairs, and have fun!

Stay with anyone  who drops out, unless you are confident that they can take care of themselves.,
Catch up with the group at the next stop, or at the end of the ride.",How to Ride Sweep for a Bicycle Group," The most typical problems are tired riders who have difficulty keeping pace with the group, and flat tires. If you are an experienced, responsible bicycle rider and prepared to handle basic roadside repairs, consider riding sweep. If you're not comfortable with the added responsibility, wait, or ride as a ""co-sweep"" with another experienced rider.
, Carry everything you will need if a group member gets stuck or has a problem.

Carry a patch kit, tire levers, and a pump or CO2 cartridges.
Carry basic tools. At a minimum, carry an adjustable wrench.  A metric hex key set and multi-tool can be good choices, too.
Carry a phone, and make sure it is fully charged.
Carry enough food and water for yourself and a little extra to share.
Carry a route sheet, cue sheet, and/or map, as necessary. You will need to be able to help someone catch up to the group if you are left behind.
Carry some cash. Have enough money to get someone a cab ride home.
Carry a first-aid kit. Review how to use it if you need to.
Carry a spare tube in a common size, or encourage riders to carry their own spare tubes that fit.

, Get to know the ride leaders and organizers if you don't yet. Meet other sweeps, too, if there are more than one. Allow time to review your route and perform a basic mechanical check on your own bike, too.,, Are there any route changes or detours on your route? Will the group split for faster and slower riders, or longer and shorter routes? (If so, each group should have a leader and a sweep.) When and where will the group stop for breaks, and for how long?, Make sure everyone in it knows you will be riding sweep, and that you're planning to ride at the back of the pack. Let everyone know you are there to help., One good exercise is to walk everyone through the ""ABC Check,"" for air (in the tires), brakes, chain and cables. For longer rides or larger groups, see if you can team up with a local bike shop or bike co-op to help with pre-ride mechanical checks., It's fine to keep company with other riders, but make sure no one gets out of sight behind you., If needed, remind ride leaders to go slower, and to wait if the later part of the group gets cut off by a red light.

If part of your ride involves climbing, agree with the ride leaders in advance that everyone will take a break at the top of the hill. Even if you can climb, walk your bike with anyone who needs to. Climbs can be exhausting and frustrating, even for experienced riders.

, Call or text the ride leader to let them know you will catch up at the next rest stop. Some common problems include:

Fixing a flat tire.
Putting a chain back on which has derailed

Adjusting and tightening a seat.

,


Call emergency services in case of a serious injury, or if you suspect someone is suffering from heat stroke or dehydration.
Call sag support, if your ride has it, to assist with more involved mechanical problems, or to give someone a ride back.
Call a family member or taxi if someone is too tired or can't complete the ride on their bike. Some taxi companies can send larger vehicles, so make sure to let them know if one is needed to carry a bicycle.
Look up bus or transit alternatives to help get someone home.
Use maps to find a direct route back to the start, or to the next stop. If your ride is on a fixed route, be careful taking alternate roads.
Call ride leaders or other sweeps to let them know if someone has dropped out, or if you need the group to wait.
Call to find a rider's family members who are also on the ride, especially the parents of a child who is riding.

, Experienced, adult riders with a map and tools of their own may appreciate your assistance, or may prefer to fix their own flat tires or call for their own ride.

Use your judgment and follow any ride rules or protocols for your group.
Exchange phone numbers with anyone who stays behind, in case they need further assistance later.

, If you've successfully repaired a mechanical failure or gotten someone back up and rolling, help that person to catch up to the group, too."

Make sure you are physically conditioned to compete in the level of race you are registered for.,
Make sure your bike is properly maintained.,
Make sure you’re outfitted with all of the necessary gear.,
Make sure to get in plenty of carbohydrates and water before the race.,
Tell your group about any preexisting medical conditions you may have.,
Get a good night’s sleep before the race.",How to Prepare for a Cycling Race," If you’ve been out of cycling practice for a while, don’t go on that 70 mile (110 km) tour.;
, A great cyclist is only as strong as their bike.


Having sturdy tires is the most important component of any race. Make sure your tires are fresh and properly inflated to prevent a wicked wipeout going downhill at 30 mph (48 km/h).
Check the condition of your cables. Often damp weather causes corrosion which can interfere with shifting and overall performance.
Check the wear on the drive chain. Poor lubrication and lack of cleaning may cause wear can also affect shifting.
Make sure your cleats and pedals are in good condition. Walking in cycling shoes wears down the cleats so they don’t bond to the pedals as well.

, This includes a strong helmet, high visibility jersey, water bottles, sunglasses, cell phone, and snacks like Powerbars are great to stick in your jersey pockets. And don’t forget the all important tire repair kit and micro pump; the question isn’t “if” you’ll get a flat, it’s “when”.

, Carbs stored as glycogen in your liver are crucial to your athletic performance. Not to mention you need the carbs throughout the race to maintain adequate blood glucose levels. Also make sure you are adequately hydrated before the race. With profuse sweating you’ll find yourself needing to drink a lot more water. And going into a race already dehydrated from training all week can be an extremely dangerous situation if your electrolytes become unbalanced.

, Conditions like heart abnormalities, diabetes, and epilepsy can be dangerous when cycling. Having well-informed teammates is extremely important if you become unconscious for any reason.

, Sleeping is crucial for your health because it’s when your body repairs itself. And if you’ve been training hard, your muscles definitely need some rest.

Wear comfortable shoes,trainers are usually enough for short Biking trips, but it is recommended to invest in special cycling shoes for longer trips.

",How to Prepare for a Biking Trip," Check tyre pressure and condition. Ensure lights , reflectors, gears and brakes are in working order.;
,,,,, Never buy a second-hand helmet. The previous owner may have a crash wearing it, so there may be undetected cracks, and may not give you that vital protection if you have a crash.

, Plenty of layers will give you the opportunity to adjust to different temperatures.A rule of thumb is, 3 layers, a tight layer, a fleece and an outer layer. Cotton is not recommended as it has high absorbency rate, and if it gets wet , stays so for a long time, losing its ability to breathe.

Always signal.",How to Ride a Bicycle in Traffic," A helmet won't prevent accidents and won't offer you much protection if you are hit by another vehicle. It can and will save you from serious head injuries if you are in an accident. Don't make the mistake of riding as though you are indestructible as you're not and taking the advice on road sense below will probably go a long way to making your journey safer. The wearing of helmets is mandatory in some countries.;
, The majority of accidents happen when drivers haven't noticed a cyclist in their way, so always have lights if it is not very bright out, and if cycling near dusk reflective clothing is a great idea. The more obvious you are to drivers the less likely they are to hit you.

, Make sure you are wearing shoes, pants and tops that are comfortable and suit the bicycle. You will be uncomfortable trying to wear a clothing that gets caught in the wheels or reveals too much once you begin riding. The right shoes are flat shoes without slippery soles.

, This means reassuring yourself that you are capable of all the basic operations, such as accelerating, changing gear, braking, looking over your shoulder, and riding while giving a signal. Adjusting things like the seat-height and the brakes can make a big difference.

, If you're an inexperienced cyclist, it is not a good idea to throw yourself in the deep end by trying heavy traffic before you are used to traffic altogether. Start off on quiet back streets and get used to being around cars and other road traffic. Gradually build up your stamina on larger roads by practicing on them on quiet days or at quiet times. This will allow you to familiarise yourself with the streets and any obstacles. Finally, build up the density of traffic that you feel comfortable with.

, Always ride with the traffic. Stay off sidewalks, stop for red lights, stop at stop signs, and obey all other traffic signs. Even if it seems like there's no compelling reason for you to stop, motorists will give you more respect if they see you obeying the rules. DON'T run red lights no matter how many other cyclists you see doing it !

, Ideally, stay at least three to five feet from the edge of parked cars, even if this means riding in the driving lane. Avoid weaving back and forth from the curb around parked cars, as this creates many ""merging"" maneuvers with traffic behind you. If you must pass a parked car at close clearance, look through the rear windows as you come up to the car, and if you see a driver, there is a good possibility that they might not see you and swing the door open straight into your path. Check for traffic beside and behind you, and move further out if necessary.

, If you need to talk on your cellphone, stop and pull over. Don't listen to an mp3 player or radio. These will greatly impair your ability to hear cars coming up behind you, considering a bike doesn't have mirrors, and you're very likely to not check behind you often, this is best avoided no matter what. You should be able to judge the speed, relative location, and type of vehicle, as it approaches you from behind without looking. At night you should also look out for signs of a passing vehicles headlights to give you an early warning that a vehicle is approaching. Most rear engine vehicles and hybrid cars are very difficult to hear, so you need to pay careful attention to not get run over by a bus.

, NEVER go down the street the wrong way. It's asking for trouble. The closing speed is greater between you and the other vehicle should you collide. Use a sidewalk if you can't go around.

, As you ride, always keep alert for others on the road. Be aware that many drivers fail to see cyclists. As such, you should always be aware of them. Look over your shoulder, or better still, get a rear-view mirror to attach to your helmet or your handlebars. You have to be aware of your surroundings at all times.

, Don't ride too close to parked cars. Parked cars can present an obstacle to a rider if a person suddenly opens a door or pulls out quickly. Always keep a door's length out no matter how much room you think motorists need to get past you. Your safety is more important than their time.

, If cars are wanting to turn, watch their direction to avoid any potential for collision. Parked cars close the the corner curb may obscure a driver's vision of your bicycle; be aware of this possibility and be prepared to give way. Don't block the right turn line, and pay attention for any cars coming up behind you that will be turning. Making sure they known you're there and that you're out of their way. When crossing an intersection watch out for any vehicles that are making a left turn, as they are the most likely not to see you, and could T-Bone you.

, As much as you hate cars that don't signal, cars hate you when you don't signal. Throw your arm out whenever you need to merge with traffic or take a turn. Having cars know what you are doing makes them much more predictable and reduces the chance of them having dumb assumptions about what your next move will be. If you need to take a turn on the other side of the road, wait for an appropriate gap then signal, then check, then move. The biggest danger for cyclists is drivers not paying attention, so always be on the look out and make sure they know exactly where you are.

Prepare the morning of the race.",How to Prepare for a Big Cycling Event," Base training involves steady, moderate cycling to train endurance. You should be able to talk while biking, and your heartbeat should reach about 60–70% of its maximum rate. Base train four or five days a week so your body learns to burn fat efficiently, saving carbohydrate fuel for more intense exercise. Aim for at least two hours per session, but feel free to ride as long as you can without fatigue.Start this at least two months in advance. Three or four months is ideal.
If possible, increase the length of the session until you are cycling for the same duration you will at the event.;
, Once you've adjusted to life back in the saddle, add short tempo training sessions two or three times a week. At this pace, you should breathe fast but not feel any burning or aching muscles. Start with 15 minutes sessions or shorter in the middle of your base training, and gradually increase the duration. After a few weeks, you may be able to tempo train for 40 minute sessions., Your lactate threshold is the highest level of activity you can keep up for 60 minutes, while keeping your lactic acid levels steady. The higher you can push this threshold, the faster you'll be during the race. Add this intense training six to eight weeks before the race:Find a flat, outdoor route without stops, or use an indoor trainer.
Warm up with twenty minutes or more of base training.
Choose a gear that lets you pedal at about 90 rpm while at maximum effort.
Start with two reps of 5 minutes threshold, 5 minutes base recovery. Do this two or three times a week.
Gradually increase intensity by a couple minutes each week, up to a maximum of 2 x 20 minute threshold with 5 minute recoveries.
For greater accuracy, find your LTHR (Lactate Threshold Heart Rate) or FTP (Functional Threshold Power).These are the maximum heart rate and wattage you can maintain for one hour. Aim to reach about 100% of your LTHR and FTP values during threshold training.

, Starting a few weeks before the race, add two sprinting sessions each week to your workout. Add them about twenty minutes into your base training, so you're warmed up but not exhausted. The goal is to push yourself above your threshold level, to unsustainable speeds. Pick one of the following:Anaerobic training: Sprint for 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 seconds. After each sprint, recover with base cycling for an equal amount of time.
VO2 max training: This is effective for races involving intense, short climbs. Sprint for 30 seconds, drop to threshold level for 2–3 minutes, the sprint for another 2–3 minutes.

, Let your muscles recover one or two days each week. Over-intense workouts increase fatigue and wear out your muscles. If you only rest one day, choose a second day for light rides only.

, Long-distance events almost always include some hill climbing. Incorporate some uphill efforts into your regular training:Practice on a hill that ranges from fairly flat to a 10–12% gradient. Climb and descend for eight reps, aiming for the same speed each time.
Practice longer climbs. Try to stick to a steady pedaling cadence, adjusting gears before each change in gradient. Sit down for portions of the climb. This is less powerful but more efficient.

, Join a local bike group or invite friends to join you for the occasional training session. If you aren't used to biking in a dense crowd of bicyclists, you might cause an accident on race day. Keep the following tips in mind:


Stay behind the back wheel of the bike in front of you, to reduce accident risk. Don't bring your front wheel alongside it until you plan to pass.
Warn your group members before switching positions, or if you notice an obstacle.
If you're training for a team event, practice drafting.
During the race, try to stay in the front third of the group, but behind another rider. This provides the greatest aerodynamic benefit., About seven days before the race, ask your group to push themselves further to simulate racing conditions. Some cyclists join smaller races a week before to boost confidence, but don't try this as a beginner to racing., During the last week before the race, taper your workout to short, gentle sessions. You want to be fresh and relaxed for the race. This is not the time to break your personal records or try an intense new route.


Many professional cyclists take Monday completely off for a Sunday race, and take Saturday very easy. Amateur cyclists should consider taking Tuesday and Saturday off as well., Two or three times this week, go on a gentle cycle ride. Don't include any interval training or even tempo pushes. Just keep up your aerobic activity to avoid getting out of form. Most of your sessions should only last 1.5–2 hours, or 15–30 minutes shorter than your normal sessions, whichever is lower., About four to six days before the race, go on a long ride at your base pace. Ride 80-100% of the distance you'll be moving in the race.This will alert your body that some serious exercise is coming up.


You should have some sense of how long it takes you to recover. Do this far enough in advance that you are back at peak shape by race day.

, Most professionals will keep their legs at top power with a mild sprinting session during the last few days before a race. Consider one or two 15-second sprints or speed climbs, or up to five for criteriums and other sprint-intensive races.For amateurs, four 45-second sprints the day before might be enough, with several minutes of recovery time in between., A massage is a great way to relax the evening before a race, both mentally and physically. Get to bed early to get plenty of rest.

, While eating healthy is important for the entire training period, what you eat in the last couple days can have a direct effect on the race. Eat a moderate dinner the night before, the same size you normally would. Include plenty of carbohydrates, such as brown rice or pasta, along with a lesser amount of vegetables and meat (or other protein). Eat a high-carb, low-protein breakfast (such as oatmeal or toast and peanut butter) two or three hours before the race to give yourself time to digest. Drink plenty of water in the 24 hours before the race. Tone down the water drinking in the evening to avoid waking up in the night.Look up carbohydrate sources on an online glycemic index. Foods with low glycemic index values may be more efficient sources of racing fuel.Serious athletes sometimes carb load a couple days before a race.

, About a week before the event, check your bike for possible issues. Here's a quick checklist to help you out:Check the tires for cuts or bald patches. If any are larger than 3 mm (⅛ in), or if you see any fibers poking through, replace the tire.
Spin each wheel. If it wobbles more than 3 mm (⅛ in) to the side, it needs adjustment. If you can bend it to the side by hand, replace the wheel bearings.
Replace the brake pads if wear is approaching the marked line. Adjust them if they are not squarely on the rims.
Tighten your handlebars if they're loose.
If your gears aren't shifting smoothly, reindex them. Confirm by hand that you can't push the derailleur past its maximum limit (the lowest gear).
Only replace a worn chain if you have time to spare. A new chain may not work with worn gears. Lubricating the chain should help.

, Assemble a light package to bring along on the race. Include the following components, and make sure you know how to use each one:CO2 cartridges and inflator.
Tire levers
Mini bike multi-tool
Two bicycle tubes

, Stash high-carb, low-fat snacks in a fanny pack or pockets, so you can eat them on the go. Dried fruit, bagels, energy bars, and energy gel are all good options.Drink plenty of water or sports drinks along with the food, and frequently throughout the race. It's easy to forget to eat and drink while you're full of adrenaline. Don't make that mistake.


Too many carbs can cause nausea, especially if you're using concentrated sources like energy bars or gel. Try them during your regular training sessions, so you have time to switch to a food that works better for you.

, Check the weather forecast. In cold weather, bring a light, warm jacket, gloves, and leg warmers. Pack sunscreen, cash, and your identification card.


Check well in advance to see whether a racing license is required. Buy it in advance and bring it to the race, or confirm that you can buy it in person on race day.

, Arrive at the race with plenty of time to spare. Go through the following checklist to prepare for a great experience:


Check your bike for problems one last time. Adjust tire pressure if necessary.
Register as soon as you can to avoid a line.
Warm up before the race begins.
Move to the start line once you notice a group forming, so you can get a good position.

"
"
Start with a short slackline.,
Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline.,
You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling.,
Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself.,
Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor.,
Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.

,
Center your weight directly over the foot on the line.,
Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.

,
Bend the leg that is on the slackline.,
Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance.,
Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.

,
Practice with the other foot.,
Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!

",How to Walk a Slackline1," The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:


The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;
The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;
It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.;
,


Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly.
Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line.
Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.

, The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls.


Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle.
But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.

, If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.

, This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.

,, With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.

,, Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.

, Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance.


Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.

,, Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.

"
These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks.,
Additionally, learn how to fall safely.,
You can also try starting with ""training wheels.""",How to Walk a Slackline2,"


Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line.
Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line.
Balance on one foot by yourself.
Balance on the other foot.
Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line.
Take small steps forward.
Take small steps backwards.
Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time.
Turn on the line.

,


As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet.
As you try new tricks, the slackline can ""throw"" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the ""throw"" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet.
If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.

,


One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble.
When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you’ll soon find that you don’t need training wheels any more!

"
"
Once you've mastered the basics, experiment with new tricks!",How to Walk a Slackline3,"


Surf the line.
Mount the line on your knees.
Start from a sitting position (sitting on your foot which is on the line) and standing up. Then repeat sitting down.
Yoga positions. This is hard. Do it slowly and maintain control.
Jump forward on the line. Switch from one foot to the other. 180's, 360's.
Do cartwheels.
Hula hoop while you slackline.

Juggle while you slackline.
Back flip off the line. This trick is easier than it looks. Practice on a trampoline first. Once you get that down, try it as a dismount, then try to land a back flip on the line.

Talk with other people.,
Interest people in cycling.,
Find out if any of your family rides.,
Look amongst your circle of friends for a cycling partner.,
Talk to cyclists you pass by.,
Talk to other cyclists in cycling clubs in your area.",How to Find a Cycling Partner1," If you never let people know who is under the helmet (when you are not riding), they will never know that you find joy cycling. You have to let yourself be known as a cyclist if you want to find someone who would be willing to ride with you. Chances are, you may find that others are willing to get you in touch with others who are also looking for a partner to ride with.;
, New cyclists are always hitting the roads, and many more want to. By talking with people about cycling, you may just find that they also want to go out cycling, and they would be more than willing to ride with you. Talk about how much better you have been doing since you have been taking bike rides, and capture their interest. More than likely, you will interest someone enough to where you can move on foward, and invite them to go out riding.

, Cycling can be great bonding time, you can cycle with a family member you wouldn't otherwise spends time with. Be prepared to motivate each other, and remember your limitations. If you choose to go on a father-son ride, remember your father may not be able to do 25 miles on the first round, and vice versa. Train up to a level which both of you are happy, and where it is an enjoyable time for both people.

, Cycling with a partner can bring friends closer together. Friends can be great people to ride with, as you can spend more time together. Convince them by saying things like, ""Oh, you will get more exercise while spending time with friends!"" be sure to put a positive spin on it, and counteract the negative aspects they may have in their mind.

, Every cyclist will get a flat tire sometime during their life. As a general rule-of-thumb, you should stop and help them fix their bicycle. Then would be a great time to ask about joining them in the future. While you help, just casually remark, ""Hey, I noticed you are cycling alone. I could ride with you for the rest of your ride, if you want."" If they agree, then do as you say. When one of you has to part, don't forget to ask if the person you helped if they want to ride with you in the future.

, Cycling clubs generally contain cyclists exclusively, which serves as a great resource to find a partner. By going to local clubs, you not only relate with other people who have the same passion, but you meet with people who also cycle in your area. This social setting is great for finding people, and all you have to do is ask.

"
"
Find a website that offers to find a cycling partner.,
Use the website to get in touch with other people who are also searching.,
Schedule to meet the person you found.,
Follow up on your rides together.",How to Find a Cycling Partner2," Websites like CyclingBuddy pair up cyclists so you have company when you ride. Using a website will offer a wide variety of people who have different endurance, speed and ride lengths. The other users are also looking for cyclists to ride with, so you will not be the only one.

, It doesn't do any good to just sign up, and leave it there. Become active and promote yourself. Be open, and be willing to try something new.

, Choose a location that is easily accessible by bicycle, but not where at your home location. Remember to exercise caution when meeting someone for the first time, as you won't know who they say they are until you meet them.

, Do not just go on a partner ride once with them, then stop or wait a month. You have to commit to riding, and be flexible on your times. Both of you have lives outside of biking, so account for that.

Care for your pogo-stick and yourself while using it.",How to Use a Pogo Stick," If it squeaks when you push down on it, has missing parts, or is falling apart, do not use it. It could pose injury to yourself or others.
, Limit is usually around 143 lbs. Most pogo-sticks state the weight limit either on the directions, or directly on the pogo-stick. If you exceed the weight limit, you will not be able to pogo as high and it may be a safety risk.Also, make sure you are wearing adequate safety gear, as riding a pogo stick can be dangerous when you are first learning. Be sure to start on a hard surface outdoors with lots of room (not grass, your pogo-stick will sink into the dirt.) Wear a well- fitting helmet, and if you want, elbow pads (knee pads may make it harder to hop on the pogo-stick)., Check the pogo stick for loose parts before you get on. Make sure that everything is secured and fastened properly. You don’t want an important piece to fall off while you are jumping. , Always wear safety gear before you get on a pogo stick, especially a helmet. Also make sure to wear elbow pads and knee pads.


Always wear shoes that lace up and have rubber soles. Never use a pogo stick barefoot or in sandals. Make sure your laces are properly tied and far from the springs. , If you are below 5’5” use a pogo stick that is 46 inches. Use a pogo stick that is at least 51 inches if you are between 5’6” and 5’11.” If you are 6” or taller make sure to use a pogo stick that is at least 56 inches.

, Your pogo stick could get stuck in the ground and you could fall. Don’t use the pogo stick in traffic or in the middle of the street. Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye out for pedestrians, cars, bikers, skate boarders, and skaters. , If you struggle to balance you can practice your balance off the pogo stick. Use a balance board before you get on to work on not falling. This will help you learn to keep control of the pogo stick once you get on.


Stand in a split stance on the board and try to keep the board still.
Try putting your feet with one foot in front of the other then slowly rock the board back and forth very controlled.
Put your feet side to side. Slowly and controlled tilt the board from one foot to the other. , Make sure the pogo stick is facing outwards. Put the pogo stick vertical and place one foot on the foot rest. Hold on to the handle bars and put your other foot on the pogo stick. Try not to put all your weight on one foot as you get on or you might fall over. Place both hand on the handlebars and grip firmly.
Push down with one foot HARD on one of the foot bars.

, So you don’t lose you balance, immediately start jumping on the pogo stick when you get both feet on. Jump towards the pedals, not away from you. Keep your arms on the handle bars and use them to stay steady and keep your balance. Keep the pogo stick close to you, don’t push it forward. You will have trouble bouncing and you might break your stick. Try just doing one or two bounces at first then get off. This will give you the feel for the pogo stick.As you push one foot down, bring the other foot onto the other foot bar.
Now that you have both feet on the feet bar, hold on tight. To hop, push down with your legs by crouching down, and hop up by pulling gently but quickly up on the handlebars while standing up completely.
Do this motion several times, and you will be hopping. Just bring your bottom down near the floor, and jerk up on the handlebars.
Don’t jump too high. If you jump high you could lose control of the pogo stick and fall. Only jump high enough to be bouncing up and down slightly off the ground. , If you start to fall over in one direction, lean your body away from how you are falling. Don’t lean too hard or you might fall over in that direction or you could start going in circles. , You might have seen people online or friends doing stunts with pogo sticks. Only do what you are comfortable doing and don’t do anything you are not ready to try. Make sure you can do regular jumping with ease before you attempt any tricks. , Once you have control of your pogo stick, you can try jumping with one foot. Start jumping how you normally would. When you have a good rhythm going, take the foot off the pogo stick that is not dominate. (If you are right footed, take off your left foot). Lean to the side of the pogo stick that does not have a foot on it to try to center yourself perfectly.

, To jump without any hands, start jumping how you would normally jump. Then, use your knees to get a good grip on the pogo stick. Slowly take your hands off of the pogo stick handles. Make sure to continue to jump, securing the pogo stick with your knees and using your knees to pull the pogo stick up.


Once you start jumping with no hands have somebody give you a ball. You can use a basketball and shoot it in a basket while you are on the pogo stick.

,

Do not leave it in the rain, snow, or any extreme weather. This may cause rust and other problems.
Do not leave it unattended. It could get stolen.
Keep it clean! A buildup of dirt or grime could slow the pogo-stick down and make it harder to hop.
If a piece comes off or starts to come off, such as the rubber bottom, Stop use immediately and fix it, get it fixed, or replace the pogo-stick. A missing piece could be dangerous.
Do not attempt tricks until: you are very good at the pogo-stick, you have supervision by someone who can help in an emergency, and proper safety gear (a helmet).
Do not use the pogo stick in dangerous places, such as: streets, near edges, near stairs, or near skateboards.
Do not pogo near small children. They could get seriously injured by your pogo-stick.
Do not attempt to go down or up stairs. You could, and probably will, hit your face on them.
Keep your pogo-stick in temperatures closest to room temperature as possible.

Ride No Handed: This is a pretty easy trick to master.,
Ride No Handed (another way).,
Do a Wheelie.,
Do an Endo.,
Stand on your bike.,
Stand on your pedals.,
Skid


slick pavements are best for this, and don't try this on a bike that has really skinny tires
get decent speed
see your target
roll towards them then hammer on the back brake
turn your handlebars slightly to one side
let the bike slide
if it goes too far, get off the back brake then roll away normally
NOTE this is really bad for your back tire, only do this when looking good is really important (like for a girl).",How to Impress Your Friends on Your Bicycle,"


When you are starting out, find a stretch of flat road without any cars.
Slowly lift your hands a few inches above the handlebars. If this is too hard, you can first lift one hand, and then the other hand. Once you do this often, you will master it easily.
Note that some bike frames are not built with a relaxed enough geometry for this to be possible. Riding no-hands is more dangerous on these bikes, as their ability to right themselves and ride straight is reduced, or absent. This is true more with older or more expensive road bikes. Cruisers and mountain bikes are good candidates for this trick.
Another way is to ride at a slightly fast speed,like going downhill,and let your right(or left) foot to make the pedal go down.At this rate your right(or left) foot is balancing the other foot so now you can lift your hands until you got the hang of it.;
,


Start coasting, and stand on your pedals.
Lean forward until your thighs are resting on the handlebars.
Stand up straight and lean back, keeping your body behind the front axle. It feels sketchy, but you can coast like this and even turn. Don't use your front brake too hard or you'll faceplant. With long enough legs and a small enough frame, you can even pedal in this position, but if not you may hit the stem. Watch out for the family jewels when attempting this!

Never turn your back on the incoming waves.,
Always swim where there is a lifeguard.,
Be aware that the bottom may have deep and shallow spots.,
When you are in shallower water, up to about thigh or waist deep, you can usually stay standing up and brace against the incoming waves.,
The easiest way to let a wave pass is to duck under the wave.,
If the surf is strong, you can dive under the wave down to the bottom and lie down on the bottom as the wave passes.,
If you see an exceptionally big wave approaching,the best approach is to run straight towards it (before the wave gets too big to dive under), when you get close enough, take a deep breath, dive down to the floor of the ocean, and do an underwater pull-down.,
If you are a strong swimmer, or have fins on, you can just swim right out, submerging under each approaching wave.,
If the surf is challenging for you, you will want to either stay in shallow water where you can easily stand up, or swim away from shore out past where the biggest waves are breaking.

,
If you find yourself caught by a wave and tumbled around, relax!.,
If you find yourself getting beat up by the waves, you either need to go into shallow water, or get away from shore past the waves.

,
If you ever feel like you are trouble, wave at the lifeguard, and ask for help.,
To get back in if you are where the waves are breaking, relax, swim toward shore, and when a wave comes, take a deep breath, relax and hold your breath when the wave comes.",How to Swim Through the Waves," Or at least be aware of each wave approaching you.;
, Ask the lifeguard where it is safe to go in the water. If there are rip currents or other concerns, he will tell you where they are and how to avoid them. Also glance back at the shore once in a while to see if the lifeguard is trying to get your attention. If there are rip currents, the lifeguard may want you to move or get out of the water.

, Be prepared to suddenly step up or down if the bottom is uneven.

, But as the water gets deeper, or the waves get more powerful, it is far easier to go under the waves.

, If the surf is relatively gentle, you can just squat down with you head a little below the surface, lean toward the incoming wave, and let the breaking wave or whitewater pass over you. Take a big breath, and just before the wave hits you duck down, wait for the wave to pass over, and come up for air. This should only take a few seconds.

, You can also face the wave and lift your feet off the bottom and fall backwards toward the bottom and let the wave pass over you.

, This will help to keep you down on the surface and to help you get through the wave. If you are close enough to the shore, you should just be able to get out of the water,this might be tricky due to the pull of the wave.

, With practice, the waves will hardly slow you down.

,, Don't try to fight it. The wave will let you go in a few seconds. Then surface and breathe and look for the next wave. Always be aware of the next wave that is coming. See Step 1. Once you are used to the feeling of being tossed around, it can be fun. The important thing is to relax, knowing that in a few seconds it will let you go. You might find it more comfortable to put yourself in a fetal position when this happens.

,, The signal for requesting assistance is waving one or two arms over your head.

, It will push you toward shore a little. Then keep swimming, always aware of the next wave that is coming.

Grab a length of rope.,
Tie a loose overhand knot.,
Pass the tail end of the rope back through the knot.,
Carefully tighten your knot without pulling the tail end through.,
Pass the slack end of your rope through the Honda knot.,
Tie a stopper knot (optional).,
Hold your lasso.,
Twirl your wrist around over your head with the rope.,
Release the rope as you feel its momentum swing forward.,
Tighten the lasso to grab your target.",How to Tie a Lasso," For a lasso, the exact length of rope you use isn't important, provided you have enough length to tie your knot, form the loop, and twirl it above your head. Any extra length can be coiled up and carried with you. For adults, about 30 feet (9.1 m) of rope is plenty; for children, shorter may be better.


If you're just practicing, nearly any type of rope will suffice. However, if you intend to actually use your lasso, you'll want a thin, tough, somewhat stiff rope. Stiffness makes the rope a little harder to tie. However, it's a desirable quality because it allows you to ""push"" the rope to make adjustments to the size of your loop.;
, The first step in tying a lasso is to make a simple overhand knot. An overhand knot is the basic type of knot you're probably familiar with from everyday life. To make one, just create a loop in your rope, then pass one end of the rope through the loop. Don't tighten this knot - keep it loose and give yourself lots of slack to work with. You'll be modifying this basic knot in the next few steps. When done correctly, your rope should now look like a large ""O"" with the loose knot at the bottom.








, Take the shorter ""tail"" end of the rope in your hand. Pull this end of the rope around and over your ""O"" loop. Thread this length of rope between the outside of the ""O"" portion of the overhand knot and itself. Pull the rope about 6 inches (15.2 cm) through. This will form a new loop which will become the base of your lasso.








, Pull on the slack end of the rope (the part you'll hold onto when you throw your lasso) and the new loop you just made. As you do this, be careful not to pull the tail end of the rope back through the knot. When finished, you should have a tight knot at the base of a small loop (with the tail end of your knot extending from the knot as well). This is called a Honda knot.








, Finally, simply pass the long slack end of your rope through the small loop in your Honda knot to create a functional lasso. By pulling on the slack end of the rope, you can tighten the lasso to grab onto objects.








, If you're just making a lasso for fun or for display purposes, you're finished. However, if you intend to actually use it, you may want to tie just one more knot to make your lasso more durable and easy to use. In its current state, the short tail end of your lasso can be pulled back through the Honda knot, causing your knot to come undone and ruining your lasso. To prevent this, simply tie a tight stopper knot at the end of the tail. A basic overhand knot will do.








, If you simply grab onto the slack end of your rope and start to swing, the tension in the rope will pull the loop in your lasso shut before you can throw it. So, it's important to use a grip that keeps your lasso wide open as you twirl it and build momentum. Hold your lasso as directed below:


Make a nice, big loop by feeding slack through your Honda knot.
Lay a foot or two of the leftover slack rope next to your loop.
Grab the loop and the length of slack rope together. This should create a ""doubled-up"" length of rope between the Honda knot and your hand. This doubled-up portion is called the ""shank.""
Point your index finger down the shank towards the Honda knot for added control.

, Holding the rope at the end of the shank, begin to swing it in a circle above your head. Be careful not to hit your head or to catch yourself by the neck. Swing fast enough that it's not difficult to keep the loop roughly horizontal, but not so fast that you struggle to control it.








, Throwing a lasso isn't the same as throwing a baseball - it's more a matter of releasing the lasso at the right time than of propelling it forward. Try to let go of the lasso as you feel its weight swing forward - this isn't necessarily when the loop itself is in front of you. Rather, it's most likely when the loop is directly to your side.









When you throw the lasso, let go of the loop itself but keep control of the rope so that you can tighten your lasso.

, Once it's around whatever you're trying to lasso, pull hard on the rope.This will pull the slack in the loop through the Honda knot, tightening the lasso around whatever object is inside it.


Never use a lasso on people or animals unless you're an experienced roper - unsafe lasso use can cause suffocation or damage to the throat. It's also difficult or impossible for someone (or something) to remove a lasso without help, so don't run this risk unless you know what you're doing.

Learn the proper movement of your feet, to propel yourself properly: move each hip individually in a twisting motion (similar to the twist) while moving your feet in response to this in an up and down motion.,
Before even attempting to ride the ground to get used to the feeling of it, so when you actually do ride the board, practice this motion while on the ground so you can execute this very swiftly, and comfortably.,
Place the board on the pavement on a flat surface or slightly downward slope.,
Create forward motion by twisting your hips and letting your feet follow.,
Stop by leaning on either side of the board, (preferably the side you're facing) and walk forward to absorb the momentum.

",How to Use a Wave Board1,";
, If you're a beginner, have someone stand in front of you (not in front of the board), so you can hold their hands until you find your balance.

, Make sure you have your protective gear on before stepping on the board! If your left leg is dominant, then that will be you leading leg. If your right is dominant, then your right will be the lead leg. Place your lead leg on the front portion of the board, and slowly push off with the foot that's still on the ground. Once the board begins slowly to roll, place your back leg on the back portion of the board.

, Your front and back feet should be moving in opposite directions as you snake your board. (This will create a wave like motion, which is why it's called a Wave Board.)

Hold the tomahawk correctly.,
Keep it straight.,
Practice letting it swing at your side.,
Take the appropriate number of steps back.,
Bring the tomahawk up in a slow, straight, controlled manner.,
Bring it forward.,
Release the tomahawk.",How to Throw a Tomahawk," Throwing a camping hatchet or an axe around might seem like fun, but it's dangerous and not recommended for the mechanics described here. Get a traditional throwing tomahawk made for the purpose. These are weighted appropriately for throwing, offering a smooth action and a lightweight, making them ideal for the purpose.You can even shop on Amazon for throwing tomahawks, which range anywhere from $20-30 dollars for entry-level quality models.;
, You need something wooden for the tomahawk to stick into, preferably dead wood that won't be harmed by the dings you're going to put in it with your expert strikes. Regularly tomahawk chuckers will typically use a slice of dead tree stump, at least 4 or 6 inches (10.2 or 15.2 cm) thick, mounted on a stand.


Aside from hurting the tree, throwing tomahawks at a rounded target can cause the 'hawk to glance and bounce unpredictably. Even if you're practice proper safety, throwing at a live tree is a bad idea.
Never throw tomahawks at targets it won't be able to stick into. It might seem fun to knock cans off the fence, but you risk damaging your tomahawk and wearing the head down considerably. It's also dangerous.

, Tomahawks don't stick into soft-wood targets because they're razor sharp, they stick because they're thrown correctly and accurately. Don't risk serious injuries by honing your tomahawk blades to paper-cutting sharpness. It's unlikely that you'll ever need to use the tomahawk for any reason other than fun target practice, so keep it dull and keep it safe.

, Only throw tomahawks outdoors. It's important to practice all the safety you'd practice if you were firing a gun when throwing tomahawks. Find an open area to set up your target that's clear of any underbrush or obstacles that'll get in the way of your flying tomahawk. Make sure no one walks behind you or behind the target at any point during your throws.

, Throwing a tomahawk is all in your arm motion and letting the tomahawk come out of your throw as naturally as possible and at the peak of your motion. Your stance needs to be upright and level, with your feet shoulder-width apart and comfortable. Your arms should be loosely and comfortably at your sides and you should be standing square with the target.

, With the handle pointed straight at your body, grip the handle as if you were giving it a firm business handshake, about an inch or two from the end of the handle. Wrap your thumb around the handle as you would a hammer, not placing it on the back as you would a knife.It's very important to not put your thumb on the back of the handle. This affects the spin greatly, causing the tomahawk to rotate differently in the air, usually ending with a loud clang against the target when it fails to stick. Wrap your thumb around comfortably.
Alternatively, if you're standing in the right spot and getting too much spin on the 'hawk, you can put your thumb up to slow it down. Practice some to get a feel for how it spins and the proper throwing motion to get a feel for what's right for your throw.

, As you stand holding the tomahawk, you want the edge of the blade to be perfectly perpendicular to the target. If the blade's axis is off just a little bit, the tomahawk will fly through the air all wonky, resulting in an inaccurate toss.


To get it level, loosen your grip some and the let the tomahawk fall slightly (don't let go entirely!) to let gravity do the work of straightening it out for you. Because it's top-heavy it should settle naturally into the right position.

, To test if you're holding the tomahawk correctly and standing properly, let your arm fall naturally to your side. The blade should be parallel to your leg, neither with the blade pointing in toward you our out away from you. If it isn't, rotate the handle slightly by loosening your grip, leaving your hand in the same basic positioning, and getting it properly situated.

, One of the biggest tricks of throwing a tomahawk accurately is getting the proper distance from your target. It's not a long distance activity. To throw a tomahawk, start with your back at the target, as if you were in a old-timey duel. Mark off five normal steps and turn abruptly, squaring yourself up with the target.


Consider marking the spot in your target area so you won't have to count if off every time you want to throw. Mark a line in the dirt with your toe, or with sticks to make it easy on yourself.

, Keep your arm very straight, holding onto the tomahawk firmly. Let your elbow flex slightly when you reach the apex before you start bringing the tomahawk forward. At this point, your elbow should be roughly next to your ear.


It's not in the wrist. Using your wrist won't only make you less accurate, the weight of the tomahawk will put stress on your wrist which can potentially lead to wrist pain.
Be very careful. If you bring the tomahawk back too quickly you may lose control, accidentally release it too soon, and throw it backwards.

, At the same speed you brought it back, start bringing it forward. You won't bring it very far forward before you release it, but the motion is similar to an overhand football or baseball throw. Stay standing very straight, keeping both feet on the ground. Don't take a step forward or backward as you throw.


Throwing is about the weight of the tomahawk and your natural easy motion, not a quick flick or an aggressive pitch. A common misconception is that you must throw the tomahawk with all of your strength, but in fact the proper technique involves a fairly slow motion, focusing on maintaining that straight line and keeping the tomahawk on track.

, When you see the middle of the handle in the top right corner of your field of vision, let go, letting your arm follow through and complete the motion back down to your side. By the time your hand is level with your eyes you should have already released the tomahawk.


Don't release later because the tomahawk needs to spin and releasing too late will make it spin into the ground. Likewise, releasing too early will send your tomahawk flying too high. It'll take some practice, but after a few throws you should have your timing dialed in.

Find which way you are more comfortable with.,
Push off with the back foot - Make sure your feet are in the middle of the ripstick, if they are to far forward or back you can easily lose balance.

,
Don't wiggle yet.,
Once you feel balanced, you should slowly start wiggling your back foot.

,
If you are unsure the safety of pushing off with your back foot whilst the board is held upright, lay the board tilted away from you, plant both feet correctly whilst its still lays on the ground, twist the front pad upright then propel.,
Lean the front foot pad left or right to turn.,
To do a tight turn, twist the front right or left and twist the back the opposite direction.

,
Have fun and be safe!",How to Ride a Ripstick," Some people like having their left foot at front and others have their right foot at front. You can test which way you like by trying both ways while holding on to the wall.
,, Try to maintain your balance while it's moving. If you are about to fall, quickly step off.

,, This will help you learn how to propel and balance the board before you try pushing off. For some this is easier, varies from person to person.

",How to Ride a Caster Board1," It can be a pole, a beam, the back of a bench, or in the best-case scenario, a friend's shoulder.

, Unlike a skateboard, a caster board will not work if you try to use it backwards. Usually, the front (nose) is not as long and narrow as the back (tail).

, Make sure your foot is directly above the caster wheel, centered on the platform, and straight across the board.

,, Again, make sure it's centered on the platform and straight across the board.

, You should begin to move!

, Master moving in a straight line without holding onto anything. This should take a good hour of straight trial and error.

, Just before your rear foot goes on the tail, use it to push off and give your body momentum, then quickly put your back foot on the platform.

, To make your turn extra tight, twist your back foot in the opposite direction at the same time. You will have to lean into the turn to maintain your balance.

While going moderate speeds or riding downhill, carve to control your speed or slow down.,
When carving, keep your weight evenly distributed on your feet, or else one of your wheels will kick out from beneath you and you'll crash.

,
If you don't have room to carve, alternate swinging your back foot in front of you and behind you to turn your board 90 degrees.,
To stop quickly, bail off your board and run.

If you are going faster than you can run, you're screwed.,
If you're skating on a sidewalk, grabbing trees, street signs, or telephone poles (if you have gloves or wrist protectors!)",How to Ride a Caster Board2," The most effective carve for speed control is a turn made by tilting the front foot while concentrating on keeping your back foot flat. You will know when you have it right because you will feel yourself slow slightly and you'll hear your front wheel roll noisily.;
,, Lean back and push against your board each time it's turned 90 degrees.

,, Try to carve or bail before this point to control your speed, because when you're going too fast, you don't want to carve for fear of falling. Try to ride out your speed or bail into grass.

While going slow or up a short, steep ramp, shuffling your feet will give you good power, but it's tiring.

,
For cruising on flat land or up slight inclines, concentrate on lazily twisting your hips and letting your feet follow as you shift your weight back and forth.,
When you're going as fast as you can on flat land and snaking your board wastes too much movement, use this advanced technique: Push both of your feet forward at the same time without turning.",How to Ride a Caster Board3,", This conserves energy and let's you go a decent speed.

, Tilt both feet toward you so your board strafes back under you. Push both feet behind you without turning. Strafe the board under you again. Continue waving your board back and forth like this while keeping your board pointed straight forward at all times. This technique keeps you cruising at the highest speeds without snaking that would slow you down, but it isn't usable at low speeds and has no power to accelerate or climb hills.

Use relaxation techniques before the race.",How to Safely Train for an Adventure Race," Because of the various disciplines involved in training for an adventure race, you should give yourself plenty of time to prepare. Starting early allows you to get your body in peak condition before you focus on specific skills.You will start with base training, which increases your body's cardiovascular fitness and trains you for endurance sports.
After a month or two of base training, you will move to more intense phases, in which you are actively training for the race while also strengthening your skills and technique in the various disciplines that are tested during an adventure race.
Allowing at least six months to train for your first adventure race ensures that you can both train and participate in the adventure race safely, and that your body is in peak condition.;
, A strong foundation of aerobic fitness ensures you have the strength to endure long hours on even the toughest endurance course. Start your training slow to build your aerobic fitness and make your body more efficient.Working at a lower intensity builds your body's aerobic fitness and trains you for endurance. Your body will burn fat rather than carbs, which helps you sustain energy during endurance activities.
Ideally, you'll want to spend at least 12 weeks in the base training phase of your training. After that, you can work into the build phase, when you improve your skills in the various disciplines. You'll gradually ramp up the intensity of your training sessions until you reach your peak within weeks of the race itself.
Invest in a heart-rate monitor (if you don't already have one) and keep track of your heart rate while conditioning. During base training, you shouldn't move beyond the first two zones, the recovery and endurance zones. This equates to between 50 and 70 percent of your maximum heart rate.
At your peak training level, you'll be working at around 80 percent of your maximum heart rate.

, Since adventure racing is an endurance sport, your conditioning workouts need to be at least as long as the race itself is going to be. Training yourself to go longer will make a shorter race easier and give you more room to increase your pace.If your adventure race is more than 12 hours long, use a marathon training plan. Try to do most of your running on trails rather than on a paved road. If your adventure race is less than 12 hours in duration, you can follow a half-marathon plan.
You can spend as little as three or four days a week training, but you may want to train for five or six days a week, particularly when you are doing lower intensity exercise during your base training stage.
Remember that an adventure race is an endurance event. You're not going to train for a 12-hour race by working out 20 minutes a day three or four days a week. Not training enough is a good way to ensure you'll get wiped out – or worse, injured – within the first few hours of the race.

, When you have a grueling adventure race in mind, it can be easy to go too hard during your first weeks of training. However, pushing your body to its limit during conditioning can lead to injury.Your training is a time to focus on your skills and technique. When you're working at full intensity it's difficult to correct your form or even pay attention to small details.
Lower intensity workouts, on the other hand, give you the opportunity to make small tweaks that will increase the efficiency of your movements during the race.
Working at a high intensity is a good way to get injured during training and never even get to the race – especially if you're training nearly every day. Training at a lower intensity means you don't need as much recovery time between training sessions.

, Hiking and hill-climbing work different muscle groups than running or walking on flat ground, so after a month or so of base training you can start to incorporate these activities into your routine.During your hill climbing, stay at about 80 percent effort to continue to build your endurance. Try several sets of a hill that takes less than five minutes to climb.
Start including interval training into your overall regimen to continue building cardiovascular strength and efficiency while you also build your strength.
Include scrambling up hills on varieties of terrain, including mud and slippery slopes. This activity also uses different muscle groups, and you want to make sure all are as evenly conditioned as possible.
Replicate a variety of race conditions as much as possible, so you'll be ready regardless of what happens in the race.

, Review the information for your particular adventure race and figure out which disciplines will be included. That way you can start dividing your training sessions up so that each discipline is covered equally.Keep in mind that if you're less familiar with one discipline, you'll need to spend more time with it – at least initially – to bring your skills up to speed with everything else.
Hire a good trainer or coach to teach you correct technique for disciplines with which you have little to no experience.
It's important to learn basic safety skills and first aid in tandem with technique. For example, while you should work on a good paddling technique and an efficient stroke, you also should learn basic water and boat safety so you don't panic if your boat overturns.
For disciplines that may occur after nightfall, make sure you do training at night so you're accustomed to moving in the dark.

, Throughout your training, you want to carry a 10-15 pound pack with items similar to what you'll be carrying during the race itself. You also want to wear similar clothing and the same shoes in which you plan to run the race.While training, you'll be able to tell if your pack is uncomfortable. You also can make sure that food and water is easily accessible to you when you need it, and make adjustments where necessary. This will keep you from panicking during the race if you can't get to something you need.
Wearing trail shoes provides more support and protection for your feet, and provide much better grip and traction on soft or slippery terrain. They can also keep you from getting blisters like you potentially would if you wore regular running shoes.
Take care of your feet and remove calluses to avoid getting deep blisters during the race.
Especially if you're training during the day, wear sunscreen year-round and insect repellant in warmer months.
Make sure you train with team members or with a coach or buddy – don't go hiking alone, even on a familiar trail where you've been many times. Include general items in your pack such as duct tape and rope that can easily be converted into makeshift assistance or support for a team member in trouble, as well as basic first aid supplies.

, Many adventure race competitors are triathletes, which means rowing may not be their strongest discipline. Focusing on your paddling can enable you to build a significant time lead in the race if you have a strong, efficient stroke.Keep in mind that you could be paddling in any kind of water, so make sure you have experience in everything from placid lakes to whitewater, even ocean swells if your adventure race will be held near the coast.
Focus on keeping your arms fully extended, and get your power from your core rather than from your arms. Use the twisting of your body to generate your stroke, not movement in your arms.
Find a canoe or kayak club that you can paddle with to get more experience in racing-type conditions. Practicing in a boat without a rudder is ideal, since you'll have experience steering a rudderless craft. Many of the boats provided by adventure race organizers are rudderless.
Try to fit in at least one or two long paddle sessions of between one and two hours over the course of your training.
Long strokes with good form will get you across the body of water faster than a greater number of short strokes.

, Not only is training in a group motivational, but there is always safety in numbers – especially if you're training in wooded areas far from the beaten path. Team members and training partners can help you out as well as giving you tips on how to improve your form and technique.Ideally, your team members will be skilled in different disciplines, so you can rely on each other to push the team forward on each leg of the race and give each team member a chance to lead.
Include others who are skilled in specific disciplines, such as rowing or climbing, so you can learn new techniques from them.
During your training, you will likely be exposed to situations that will enable you to figure out how you can help other team members out if disaster strikes out on the trail.

, While affixing a large light to your bike will add considerable weight, it will be worth it for the safety it provides – especially if you're biking on a difficult or technical trail.Use LED lights since they weigh less. You may also want to wear an LED headlamp.


Keep in mind that trails typically aren't lit at all, and often one wrong turn could send you tumbling off into a ravine. Both in training and in the race itself, you shouldn't sacrifice safety in the belief that you'll make your load lighter.
Rig your bikes with towlines and hooks so you can get bikes out of bad situations if need be. Retractable dog leashes can work well as towlines and won't take up a lot of room in your pack.
Practice riding on your teammates' bikes as well as your own so if you have to switch bikes or bike parts for some reason you'll still be comfortable.

, Some adventure races include a climbing or rappelling component. While you may be able to go around these rock faces, you'll lose precious time doing so.Unless you're going on a longer adventure race or an expedition race, you may not have much use for climbing skills. Check the information for your adventure race carefully so you can plan your training time accordingly.
Practicing rappelling with your team also enhances trust and bonding among team members, which will be a crucial mental component going into the race.
When you're doing any climbing, make sure your pack is secured and your hair is tied back out of your face. You don't want anything to get caught up in your rappelling equipment, or to fall off the side of a cliff.

, When you register for your adventure race, you'll receive detailed information about the course of the race, the obstacles or challenges you will face, and the skills that will be tested.Use this information as a blueprint for your training regimen. If there's any component of the race in which you have little experience, use your training time to get comfortable with that skill and learn how to complete that leg of the race safely.
Study the route the race will take until you're relatively familiar with it. If you have the opportunity to do so, you may want to do part of your training in the same area where the race itself will take place.

, Almost all adventure races have a navigation element, which will require you to read and understand a topographical map and navigate using a compass. In the age of GPS systems, this may be an area where you need a lot of practice.Shortchanging this aspect of preparation or assuming you'll be able to pick it up on the fly can have serious negative consequences for you and your teammates during the race.
Buy a book or research orienteering online, and study until you have the basics down. Then you may want to consider joining an orienteering club or attending a class or camp so you can test your skills in a real-world situation.
If you do join a club, pay attention to the technique of more seasoned members. Ask questions, and pick up as many tricks and shortcuts as you can to make this skill easier for you to do quickly and efficiently.

, In the days before the race, make sure all equipment is functioning properly and any systems you've rigged will actually perform as you've designed them to perform.Test safety devices and harnesses to make sure they're going to operate correctly if you need them during the race.
Make sure you know everything you have and how to access it. You also should know what your teammates are carrying and how they can access their gear.
Pack plenty of food and water for everyone, including sports gels for energy and other snacks that can be eaten quickly for efficient fuel on the trail.

, An adventure race is a team sport. Whether you have a single partner or a larger team, your bond with each other is perhaps more important than your speed and skill. Work together with commitment to each other and you will be successful.During training as well as during the race itself, be aware of your teammates at all times. If someone is having a problem, you'll need to be able to help them as a team and get them back in the race.
All team members should have mutual respect for each other and treat the event as a team effort rather than an individual effort or accomplishment.
Get to know your teammates and their strengths and weaknesses. Be willing to put your ego aside if need be for the good of the team as a whole.

, On the day of the race, you will likely be excited and nervous. This kind of stress will not allow your body to operate at peak efficiency. Meditation and relaxation techniques calm your body and help you mentally prepare for the race.Visualization is a technique that works for many athletes. Much of your nervousness comes from anticipation of something unknown. Visualize yourself in your mind calmly overcoming the obstacles and running swiftly over trails.
Deep breathing exercises also can work to relax your body and mind. As you inhale, think of energy coming into your body. Expand your chest and hold your breath for a few seconds. As you exhale, think of stress and fatigue that you are releasing from your body.
Use the techniques that work for you. For example, if one of your teammates swears by meditation but you don't get any benefit from it, respect that you and your teammates might have differences in mentally preparing and keep open minded towards your teammates.

Before starting your bodyboarding adventure, be comfortable in the ocean.,
Know the layout of your break.,
Have a sturdy leash and attach it to your board with a plug and on the handle, you want a double attachment.,
Choose a bodyboard appropriate to your weight and so you can be competitive in catching waves.,
In dealing with incoming waves, progressively use the different techniques according to the wave strength: 1) in small waves, stay on the board and punch through the wave, 2) in bigger waves do an Eskimo roll and continue paddling without skipping a beat, 3) and with the biggest waves, turn your board belly up, kick hard with your legs, hold your bodyboard firmly, and head out and down to the bottom.

,
You will get caught on the inside of a big wave when the wave of the day comes in, when you get dropped in on, or from mistake in judgement.,
When paddling for the horizon or directly into the wave, anticipate where the power of the wave will be and avoid that area.,
Smaller waves and shallow water will usually not be life threatening.,
Big waves break in deep water, so with most big waves, be concerned with drowning and collisions with other bodyboarders, surfboards and surfers.,
Bailout as a last resort if going over-the-falls will be truly horrendous.,
Avoid shoulder injury on the side that the leash is attached to your wrist.,
Always do a set, of perhaps 15 repetitions, of lying leg crossovers.",How to Prepare for Getting Caught on the Inside," Swim for distance, practice all the swimming strokes, read about drownproofing, and be able to do a bit of diving. Read surfing, bodyboarding and surfing books and articles and learn how other surfers deal with getting caught on the inside. Also know the dynamics of the ocean, waves and currents.;
, Observe, talk to other people and read books. Go snorkeling or paddling, when the ocean is calm. Identify the problems such as reefs, pilings, rocks, strong currents, metal etc.

, A six foot high layer of whitewater takes time to settle enough to allow breathing, and even so, the next wave will be coming. Do not get separated from your board.

, Shop around for the right board and price.


On the beach, set your bodyboard on the sand and notice how it reacts to the wind. Aerodynamics is similar to hydrodynamics. Note that all bodyboards are the most stable upside down. In smaller waves, dismount and experiment hanging on to your bodyboard in a broken wave: 1) with the board right side up and hanging on to the nose, 2) with the board right side up and hanging on to the tail, 3) with the board upside down and hanging on to the tail, and finally 4) with the board upside down and hanging on to the nose. The fourth method has the least resistance and is what you should do in the big waves.

,, Whatever the reason for being in a terrifying position, this is what you should do: 1) paddle either for the horizon or the paddling channel, 2) get caught in deep water or get pushed in to shallower waters.

, Either be: 1) ahead of that power or 2) after the wave has broken and its power has weakened somewhat. When ahead of the power, you may have to get off the board and dive. If you can survive that wave, without losing ground, paddle furiously to outside to escape the next wave - you will be in good position. If paddling to the outside is not an option, let the wave break before you - you will lose your position and get pushed towards shore

, Stay flat, perfectly level on your board and do not have the nose high such as in the paddling and wave riding positions. Paddle out of the shallow water with shallow, oar-like strokes and with your legs level. Beware of sharp corals, boulders, metal and sea urchins. For fun and safety, ride safe waves and at places where people do not get hurt or die.

, When in extreme underwater turbulence, perhaps in eight feet, or bigger and powerful wave, minimize the violent wave force (like a 500 pound gorilla chiropractor adjusting your back) on you by forming your body shape into a ball. In very big waves, the board will get ripped out of your grasp and you will be at the wave's mercy. If you fear a collision, protect your head and neck.

, You will be the anchor and headed to the horizon, and slightly downwards, where there is less turbulence. If you need just a bit of distance, away from the churning turbulence, to avoid disaster, bailing out may be the correct move, however factor in, the kite-effect, the board will have if the leash is attached far from the tip of your bodyboard. Generally, do not abandon your board.

, Do chin-ups, rows and rearward shoulder shrugs. Keep your shoulder and elbow tight, when you lose your board and have to depend on your leash.

, This is an easy exercise, do it twice a month at the very minimum. The purpose of this exercises is to avoid any mind-numbing heel to shin impacts when getting tossed around, like a rag doll, in the underwater turbulence.

Set up.,
Insert the pipe into the stops and under the Pipe-Lock screws.,
Try Skier style.,
Try Boarder Style.,
Try SUP Style Kanoa ride.",How to Ride a Holoholo Balance Board1," Put the Pipe Roller parallel to the board.;
, Tighten it using your fingers.

, This is also called the SUP (Stand Up Paddle-board) style. It is the easiest style to learn. Place your feet on the board in line with the pipe and board. Bend your knees for more of a challenge. Wheelies, hang ten, and other moves are possible, and you can get a skiing sensation when transferring weight across the roller. Balance requirements are very similar to stand up paddle boarding.

, Step onto the Holoholo board as if it were a skateboard; the board will have a slight roll and lots of tilt to challenge your balance. Once you are comfortable with the board touching the ground on both sides, you can try to stay balanced in the small amount of travel or roll that is allowed by the Pipe-Lock and stops. There is a fine line you can feel when you are centered over the pipe roller and maintaining control. That same sensation is common to most board sports. Once you have your balance, try kick turns, 360's and all kinds of skate tricks. Practice rail grabs and other surfing, snowboarding, and wake board positions.

, Sometimes the board is restricted from stops if you do the kanoa ride.

,
Lay the 1/2 pipe on the carpet or pad with open side facing down.",How to Ride a Holoholo Balance Board2," The board is restricted by stops, but is not locked in as it is in Method 1. Spotter or assistance is recommended for beginners.

, This will feel very much like skiing. It employs the same basic concept as the Indo and Bongo Boards. Place your feet on the board boarder-style and then shift your body weight to the raised side of the board. The board will tilt and the roller will move back and forth between the stops on the bottom of the board. This is great fun and when you bend knees and lower your body weight, it becomes even more challenging.

, Keep feet on opposite sides of roller, falls likely if both feet are on same side of roller.

,,,,, Extension and flexion of calves and centering of body weight with little risk of falls.

, Make sure the 1/2 pipe stays in knock outs and test by placing one foot atop the board and pushing on the board. If it fits correctly the board and 1/2 pipe will move as one unit. You can ride this set up in-line skater/skier and boarder style. You can even do basic kick turns while riding boarder style by pivoting on one end of the board similar to skateboarding.

,,, Improves lateral shifting of body weight and basic sense of balance. Place the 1/2 pipe perpendicular to the length of the board, open side facing the ground or the rounded part touching the board.

, Approach the board from the middle of the length of the board and place one foot on at a time. It will rock laterally. Try to keep the board centered or level so that neither side touches the ground. Benefits- Encourages a natural bend to knees and keeping body weight centered and lateral movement awareness.

, Place feet in the center of the board so it rocks toward your toes and heels. This has skier type feel and also helps develop a good ""ready position"".

,,,, You can either place the board and pipe set as in method #3 on top and then step on the board or you can start riding boarder style and pivot or kickturn to basically climb on top of the 1/2 pipe. This will add challenging angles to balance on and interact with.

Add in essential oils.",How to Make Surf Wax1," Pour in about 1 ½ cups (354.8 ml) of water in the bottom of a double broiler. Heat on medium heat until the water is hot and steaming. You do not need to boil the water, you just need it to be hot enough to melt the beeswax through steaming.If you don’t have a double broiler, you can also simply heat water in a pot on the stove, then put an equal sized pot on top of it to create the effect of a double broiler.;
, Once the water has heated and is steaming, place 1 cup (240 ml) of beeswax and ¼ cup (60 ml) of coconut oil in the top pan of the double broiler. Place the top of the double broiler on top of the bottom pan., Once you place the beeswax and coconut oil over the bottom of the broiler, they should begin to melt. As they melt, stir the ingredients constantly so that they don’t get stuck to the sides of the pan., If you want your wax to be fragrant, add a few of drops of essential oils when the wax and coconut oil have melted and mixed together. Popular oils to use are lavender, peppermint, lemon or rosemary.


If you prefer the subtle scent of the coconut oil, don’t add any essential oil.

Spot the ding.,
One way to fix a shatter, is first to lightly sand around the edges and any exposed edges of cloth, if it goes through the entire thickness of the outer coating to the foam you may need to open the crack with a sharp knife and let it dry out first.

,
Tape around the area, approximately 1 centimeter (0.4 in), with good quality masking tape (cheap tape soaks up the wet resin and can leave a mess).

,
If the ding is near the edge of your board, make sure you ramp the tape so the resin will drip off.,
When the resin is almost dry pull off the tape, wait a few hours and sand smooth with water and fine wet and dry sandpaper.,
Sand around the area the same as for a shatter and then tape it off.,
Mix up a cold batch of resin and add to this some foam powder, finely cut fiberglass matting or a filler mix so it is like a paste or putty and push this into the ding with something like an ice-cream stick.,
When it is dry, apply a hot thin coat of finishing resin.

,
Peel off the tape as the resin starts to set, leave to dry and sand flat with water and a fine wet and dry sandpaper.

Allow your board to remain unused for 3 days so surfboard resin can completely set and finish the process.

",How to Make a Surfboard," You need a space that's both large and well ventilated.


Working outside is a plus when it comes to ventilation, but an indoor facility with 3 perfectly placed fluorescent lights will show flaws in your shaping so you can catch them early on.
This is a weather dependent project if you work outdoors. Know that you won't be able to do any work in the rain, snow, or even in the wind.
It may be a good idea to build a room specifically for board building; for a short board you will need at least a 10 feet x 8 feet (3 meters x 5.4 meters) room and longer than 10 feet if you're building a long board.;
, This will depend on your height and the intention of the surfboard's wave riding ability.


It would be wise to create a paper cut out with these exact measurements and place it on the wall in your workspace so you can refer to it often.

, The easiest way to do this is to trace a pre-existing surfboard and, if necessary, adjust according to your specified measurements.


Lay your plywood on the ground, placing the surfboard on top of it. Make sure the stringer (the wooden strip that stretches the length of the board through the middle) is perfectly lined up to the plywood's ends.
Mark placement points using a marker at the nose and the tail, at the board's midpoints, then all the way around the board making each consecutive point parallel from the last so the surfboard's cut-out it accurate. This template will be the shape of your board, so be extremely careful to not move the board or the plywood. Be completely precise in your markings.
Put on your safety goggles, plug in the jigsaw, and very carefully cut along your points to create you surfboard shaped template.

, You can get countless different shapes, weights, lengths, and densities as well as your choice of foam or wood. You even have the choice of custom ordering.


The type of blank you need depends on how you ride the wave. If you love to rip small waves, the lesser density blank is for you (as long as you don't mind replacing it every couple of months). The denser the board, the stronger it is and the longer it will last.
EPS foam is often hailed as a good choice of material for the blank, as it is both a strong and lasting material while being lower in density than polyurethane foam., Set the template on top of the blank, making sure it lies completely flat along the stringer line. Using a thick pencil, trace the shape of the surfboard template onto the blank from nose to tail. Turn over the blank and trace the shape onto the front.

, Be sure to leave 1 to 1 1/2 inches (2.54 to 3.81 cm) excess from the surfboard template trace; this will give you room to shape without catastrophic error.


Saw with extreme caution, especially when cutting around the stringer on the nose.

, Adjust the electric planer to a .08 inches (2 mm) depth and very delicately (from tail to nose) plane the underside of the board. Turn it over and plane the top of the board. Plane only enough to reach the softer white foam under the hard surface.


When you get closer to the nose, it will become difficult to use the electric planer; this is when to use the hand and finger planers for precision.

, Get the form to approximately what you want, and then put the planer away to avoid overdoing.

, The back � of the rail should be a sharp edge while the front 3/4 needs to be more rounded.

, (168 g) of the fiberglass cloth. Using nicely sharpened scissors, trim the cloth around the shape of the blank making sure to leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of extra cloth draping over the board. Cut the cloth into 'V' shapes where your board curves so you can fold over the rails.

, (800 mL) of resin with catalyst (read ratios for your specific product).

, Beginning in the center of the board, use the squeegee to work the resin in a pseudo figure 8 pattern throughout the middle of the board. When you reach the edges, work the resin out and over the rails to lock in the fiberglass. Resin should take around 5 to 6 minutes to cool, so timing is important. Be sure the entire cloth is evenly wet and secure on the blank. Leave any excess cloth (it will eventually be covered), but make sure to squeegee away any excess drips.

, Add an extra 4 oz. (133 mL) layer of fiberglass on the deck for added strength.

, Cut 6 5-inch x 2-inch (12 cm x 5 cm) pieces of fiberglass cloth and tape them to the board using masking tape.
, (500 mL) resin and catalyst mix. Squeeze out about half the surfboard resin using your gloved hand. Immediately place the rope along the fins marks and stretch to 3/4 inch (1 cm) longer than the mark. Cut the rope and repeat on all marks.

, Smooth out the surfboard resin against the base of the fins so the cloth keeps it in place. Squeegee extra resin drops away and let the resin cure for 1 day.

, (1000mL) of hot resin with catalyst. Pour over the surfboard, fin side up, spreading with the wide paintbrush until entire area (including fins) has been covered. Swipe any drips with paintbrush until the dripping subsides, then allow the surfboard resin to cure for 3 hours. Turn it over and repeat on the other side.

, The hole you drill should be 2 1/4 to 3 1/4 inches (6 to 8 cm) from the tail, near the stringer. Use a small knife to peel away the fiberglass and foam until the leash plug is even with the deck. Mix 3 oz. (100 mL) of hot coat resin with catalyst and pour a small amount into the hole. Place the leash plug into the hole then fill rest with resin to set. Wipe away the excess resin with a paintbrush then allow it to cure until solid.

, bumps and lumps) are gone, as well as the gloss. You will have to do some sanding by hand during this process too. Fine grit sandpaper is recommended.


Don't over sand; this will cause damage to the board. If this happens, use a small amount of surfboard resin and fiberglass cloth to fix the damage, then re-sand to smooth blemishes.

,


Without this extra sanding step, your board will make your skin irritated and itchy.

Find a healthy conifer.,
Create a flat, cleared area on the face of the tree.,
Place a bucket under the tree.,
Cut V-shaped notches into the cleared rectangle.,
Check the bucket every day.,
Use a double broiler to melt ingredients and form the wax.",How to Make Surf Wax2," Cold-water wax differs from warm-water wax because it requires the addition of tree resin. To extract tree resin, first find a conifer tree that generally looks healthy, with relatively smooth, tight bark and without many dead branches or limbs.Conifer trees are trees that grow conifers, the cone-like growths that grow on tree branches. Examples of conifers are pine, spruce, maple and cedar trees.
If you don’t want to extract tree resin yourself, you can find it on Ebay or other online sites.

, Once you have found a suitable tree, use a machete or a hatchet to cut downward on the bark about 3 feet from the ground. Make a rectangle that is about 10 inches long and 6 inches wide.Try to cut cleanly so that you cut out a flat area about 1 inch deep into the tree.

, Place a bucket against the tree directly underneath where you made the rectangular indent. Use a flat piece of metal or another smooth material to make a ramp that leads from the cleared rectangle into the bucket.


The ramp will catch the resin as it comes out of the tree and lead it into the bucket. Therefore, it’s important that the ramp is flush against the tree and leads directly into the bucket.

, After you set up the bucket, use the hatchet or machete to hack into the cleared rectangle you made, forming V-shaped notches that are about half an inch from each other.It may be easier to do one side of the “V” at a time, hacking downward slashes on the left half of the rectangle and then hacking upward slashes on the other side of the rectangle.

, Collecting tree resin isn’t instantaneous. You may have to wait several days for enough resin to collect. Keep the bucket under the tree and check on it daily. When it looks like you have about ¼ cup of resin, remove the bucket from the tree and transfer the resin to a small bowl.It should take two to three days to collect ¼ cup (60 ml) of resin.

, Use the same steps used to make cold-water wax, adding in the additional ingredient of ¼ cup (60 ml) of tree resin along with the beeswax and coconut oil in the top of the double broiler. The resulting wax will have a slightly stickier consistency than warm-water wax."
"
Pour the wax into a tin or container.,
Let the surf wax harden.,
Use the wax or close and store the container.",How to Make Surf Wax3," Once the ingredients of the warm or cold water wax have fully mixed together, pour the wax into a container or tin large enough to fit it. Scrape the sides of the pan to be sure to get out all the wax.


Use a tin or container that has a top so that the wax won’t dry out.

, Before you close the container of surf wax, leave the wax out to harden for three to four hours or overnight. Leaving the container open lets the heat escape so that the wax can harden faster, and so its consistency stays the same., After the wax has hardened, it is ready for use. When you are done using the wax, place the lid on the container and store it in a cool place out of direct sunlight."

Learn what ""broken waves"" or ""white waves"" are.,
Start off by catching smaller waves and progress to slightly larger waves with more power.

,
Select waves by looking out to the horizon.,
When at a new surf break, or even before paddling out to your regular break, observe the waves from shore for a while.,
Paddle out to the lineup, this is where the waves should be breaking.,
Hold your position at the lineup by backpedaling with your hands and kicking with your feet from the knees down.,
Give the right of way to the first person on the wave.,
If somebody has already taken off on a wave, you could drop in, make the bottom turn and pull out immediately.,
Waves come in a set and it is possible to catch two waves in a set by catching the first or second wave, have a brief ride, paddle out and catch the another wave at the tail end of the set.

Surf a lot and gain experience to know which wave to catch.",How to Know What Waves You Should Be Surfing," A broken wave is one that has already broken or crumbled and is now rolling in towards the beach. The waves that you should not be catching are known as ""unbroken waves"" or ""green waves"".;
,, Pick a wave that is further out. Do not rush and decide to catch a wave when it is only one metre in front of you. Give yourself time to prepare yourself.

, Is there a paddling channel to go out? What kind of people are out there? How would you classify the wave size numerically?

, The lineup is a group of surfers sitting on their boards and holding their positions. Paddle outside of the lineup and be the first one to catch a big wave.

, Sitting on the board, you won't get much propulsion with your hands and lower leg, so if you lose your position, lay on your belly and paddle normally. To accurately hold your position, you should be looking at two or more landmarks.

, If you judge that the first person on the wave will not be able to make the section, then take off on the wave too.

, You will be in and out. Do not interfere with the person already on the wave.

,, Even experienced surfers misjudge waves and look foolish trying to catch a small wave.

Get surfboard bags.,
Get grips.,
Get leg-ropes.,
Get waxing equipment.,
Get soft racks.",How to Get the Right Surfing Accessories and Equipment," Surfboard bags are an absolute necessity to protect your surfboard from dings, chips, cracks, and general damage. Surfboard bags range from lightweight covers to standard padded day bags, to heavy padded travel bags. A padded day bag is the most popular bag and will provide your surfboard with a protective cover while you are transporting or storing your surfboard. Most quality board bags will have a silver protective side which is designed to reflect the sun, plus wax and fin pocket on the inside of the bag and shoulder strap for easy handling.;
, Grips are placed on the deck of your surfboard at the tail end to do exactly that.... give extra grip. Once your surfing develops you will start to get more power and drive into your turns which are driven by your back foot. However as a beginner you will not benefit from a grip as an advanced surfer would, you will find a grip is great for your foot placement. You will clearly feel the patterned, grippy rubber when you plant your back foot on the grip and you will know your back foot is positioned in the right place. Grips come in a range of colors and patterns, they should be positioned just above the legrope plug on the deck of your surfboard.

, Leg-ropes come in a rage on lengths. What you need to consider when purchasing a Leg-rope is: 1. The size of the surf you usually surf in, the bigger the surf usually means the longer and heavier your leg-rope should be. 2. How big you surfboard is, longer surfboards with more weight require longer legropes. You will find as a beginner the most suitable leg rope will be one that is described as standard or regular and is roughly the same length as your surfboard. Most good quality legropes will have double swivels to help avoid curling of the cord, padded ankle cuff for extra comfort and a key pocket. Legropes are attached to your surfboard by a string that is looped around the legrope plug at the tail end of your surfboard. It is important to remember that legropes DO break, have regular checks of your leg rope and look for small cuts in the cord. Also, after a while the cord will become fully stretched and lose it elasticity, this means your surfboard will not return to you as easily. If your leg-rope does become fully stretched consider purchasing a new one.

, A common mistake by beginner surfers is not having enough wax on their surfboard. You should wax the deck of your surfboard from the tail or top of your grip to approximately eye level. Apply your wax by rubbing circles to form small beads. Once you have good coating of wax you will not have to apply wax every surf, however it is a good idea to have a wax comb which you can comb through the wax to rough up your wax and get to the fresher wax underneath the top shine.

, Soft racks are a removable roof rack. They are a specially designed padded rack that strap around the roof of your car and allow you to easily transport your surfboard. They come in single or double racks, are quick and easy to install and are a much cheaper alternative than a permanent roof rack.

Lighten up your hair.,
Get the surfer wave in your locks.,
Mix and match your bikinis.,
Shop the surf brands.,
Add some jewelry.,
Go barefoot!",How to Look Like a Surfer1," Surfers spend a lot of time in the sun, leaving them with that sun-kissed look to their hair. Even if you don't spend as much time at the beach, you can get this same look in the salon.Go for an overall lightening, but avoid getting too platinum.
Highlights are a great way to make you hair look like it’s been in the sun.;
, It seems amazing that surfers can get out of the ocean and when their hair dries, it looks effortlessly amazing. The secret here is the salt water. You can get this effect of crunchy waves by using a sea salt spray on your hair. Towel dry your hair. Spray on some sea salt spray, scrunch your hair with your hands, and let it air dry.


There are several sea salt sprays available. Choose the one which most appeals to you.Another option is making your own sea salt spray by mixing 1 cup of hot water with 1-2 teaspoons of sea salt (not table salt) and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in a spray bottle. Shake it well for a minute or two and its ready to use.

, A popular style for surfer girls is mixing up bold colors and prints. This make sure you stand out in the crowd and represent your own style. Surfer bikini bottoms tend to have a mid-rise cut to them. The tops are focused on staying on and usually have a sporty look like a criss-crossed back or racerback, similar to a sports bra.When mixing and matching, try using different patterns with the same color scheme, or similar patterns in different colors.Try wearing a solid bikini bottom in a bold color, and matching it with a printed bikini top.

, There are a lot of surf brands which have clothing lines.Some of the most popular brands are Billabong, Hurley, Rip Curl, Quiksilver, RVCA, and O’Neill.Roxy is a popular female clothing line which is an offshoot of Quicksilver.


These brands provide high fashion, and high quality swimwear, which will keep you in fashion and a durable suit.
Consider wearing a tank sporting one of these brand names with your bikini top underneath., Layer your wrist with bracelets! Don’t be shy about adding 7 or eight bracelets at a time. Choose bracelets woven out of brightly colored fibers. You may also want touches of seashells and beads.A more formal option could be a thin metal bracelet with sea glass.
Cinch the fiber bracelets to different sizes so that they run up your forearm, rather than lying on top of each other on your wrist.

, If you are not on the beach, make it as barefoot as possible with a strapped sandal to keep that nearly bare look going from the beach to the street.A more casual option would be simple flip flops. Many come with floral and beach prints on the sole.
If you need more coverage, choose a slip-on canvas shoe with a floral print.

Keep as little of your body in the water as possible.,
Restrict you water activities to where there are lifeguards.,
Look at shark attacks by location.,
Be careful or avoid body boarding or short board surfing at river mouths.,
Avoid murky waters.,
Surf a break or two away from harbor mouths.,
Be aware that points, like river and harbor mouths, are areas with a high concentration of fish including sharks.,
Avoid dawn, dusk and night surfing, sharks are more active at those times.,
When shore fishermen have chummed the water to attract big fish, avoid surfing at those times.,
Continually look around for sharks and especially when there are spear fishermen in the area.,
Keeping your position in the lineup will have you facing the same direction, look outside for waves and look around yourself for sharks.

,
Stay out of the water when you have coral cuts, or any type of wound, do some over activity until your wound heals.,
Do not urinate in the water.,
Although, fish and sharks can be seen in shallow waters, they are usually wary of man, and are in deeper waters.,
If there are many turtles, be careful or avoid surfing on that day.,
Follow the news and websites for shark sightings.,
Consider board and shorts designs with tiger stripes.,
Read about sharks in general and the sharks in your area.

,
Distinguish between the dorsal fin of a porpoise, shark and killer whale.

,
If there is a shark, head for shore with strong steady strokes and catch the first wave in.

",How to Minimize Meeting up With Sharks," Swimmers, spear fishermen, wading fishermen, body boarders and short board surfers are more vulnerable than long board surfers, stand up board paddlers, kayak paddlers, jet skiers, kite boarders and windsurfers.;
, Lifeguards are on the lookout for sharks and they will post warning signs if sharks are in the area.

, When in those high risk areas, take all precautions and possibly upgrade to a safer vehicle. Instead of body boarding or short boards surfing, consider kayaking or stand up board paddling. Generally, the country beaches, as opposed to the city beaches, have a higher incidence of shark attacks and encounters.

,


The ocean predators place themselves at river mouths because it is great for ambushing. Think of the river mouth as a crossing like a bridge or an intersection, where if you place yourself there, you can meet up with many people.
Avoid river mouths after heavy rains. The smaller river life, unable to swim against the strong flow, gets washed into the ocean and attract the predators.
Be observant at river mouths because of the lower visibility. The water is not clear here with the brown, fresh water and even more so after a rain.
Farmers may dump carcasses, and parts of pigs and cattle, in rivers and streams, so avoid going in the water when you see this kind of dumping.

, For whatever reason, murky water seems to have more than their fair share of shark attacks

, Harbor mouths, like river mouths, are a natural underwater heavy traffic zone. Additionally, sharks stay in these areas to get free handouts by commercial fishermen discarding fish parts after cleaning.

, A big, long points protrudes out into the ocean and for the fish to get from point A to point B, they have to go around the point. The fish will not make a big turn around the point, they will swim close to it. Unfortunately, point breaks make nice waves that do not close out, and a paddling channel.

, You also will not have great visibility without sunlight. The winds increases during the day, choose mid morning or later afternoon to get wet. The minus side of this is that the conditions, with the lack of winds that make the waves sloppy, are great at dawn and dusk, and additionally the crowds at the breaks are smallest at dawn.

, Sharks can smell well and will be drawn to the chum, fishermen sometimes catch big sharks unintentionally.

, The fish on their stringers will attract sharks.

,, It is usually beginners who have coral cuts because they are in the inside in shallow water and small waves.

, Urinate just prior to entering the ocean.

, Avoid deep waters. Stay with the pack, do not be one, way on the outside, hoping to catch that big wave first. Do not body board or surf alone. Unfortunately, shallow waters have small waves.

, Sharks like to eat turtles. Know what the sharks in your area feed on. When marine life make quick movements, they are reacting to predators.

, Heed warning signs on the beach. Also check for jellyfish and Portuguese man of war warnings.

, There is a fish, with a similar design, that sharks do not eat.

Get your surfboard.,
Find a beach with small, foamy waves.,
Wax your board.,
Get into the water.,
Get past the break.,
Try getting up.,
Stay in one direction.",How to Learn to Surf a Longboard (for Beginners)," Since you are just beginning, you might want to go for a longboard. It paddles and catches waves easier.


You might want to try the Greco 2.0. It is perfect for beginners as it's made of foam, so those nasty wipeouts won`t hurt as much as a fiberglass, it is very long, but not too long and it's also fairly cheap at only $250.;
, If you live in places like Hawaii, you can go to a different beach every day and never catch a wave nearly the same. If you live in a place like that, do your research or ask an adult who might know the best location, like a lifeguard. You don`t want barrels or powerful waves. You want a normal looking wave that slows down as you catch it and turns into a wavy foam that can only bring you so far. If you live in a place like Alabama, where you can go miles down the coast and see the exact looking waves, you'll just have to settle for a spot. Probably the closest to you so you will be home in time for dinner. Location, location, location!

, There are all kinds of surfboard waxes. You can find them anywhere near the beach. Wax is an easy-to-apply, well...wax that you put on your board. Any wax works on any board, but if you feel yours is not cooperating, research a little and find the wax for your board. Applying wax is easy. Different people do it different ways. Some rub theirs in circles on their board. Others go East to West and North to South. You do it how you think works best for you.

, Most beaches don't just drop straight down to the deep so try running while holding your board until you get about between waist and knee deep in water. Then just hop on your stomach and start paddling.

, Keep in mind the saying: ""Brave the wave"". Go straight through it! You won't need to learn duck diving yet because you are in small waves. If you're about past the break, but not yet, what usually happens is you're paddling to an upcoming wave about to break and it breaks right on your head or back! That will surely bring you down and back. Try to wait it out or charge through just in time if you are close enough to the wave because going under could hurt you badly. From coral to your own board, always stick your hand up out of the water first so you can know what's above you.

, Like any sport, this takes time to master and perfect. One way is to place your hands level with the chest and ready to pop up. Then you lift your body up till everything is off the board except your knee and below and your hands. You then push up into a position that little kids use as a dog. Your back should be arched, and maybe even pop a little. Next, bring a foot to where it is ""standing"" on the board. Your knee should touch your chin. Always be looking straight forward. Then use all your power to push up your other knee and stand. Your back foot should then be facing the side and your front foot straight ahead. Never take all of one whole foot off your board. So just keep the ball of your foot on the board and twist your foot to where you're in the perfect position. Don't rush it, though. The perfect, professional pop-up that is one swift blink of an eye takes months of practice.

, Since you're a beginner, you should not attempt turning. Stay straight, legs bent, arms out, and be always looking forward. When your wave dies down and loses its vibe, it's time to hop off and paddle back out for the next wave. But if you're so thrilled that you want to ride all the way to the shore, knock yourself out!

Embrace prints.,
Wear chinos instead of jeans.,
Get some board shorts.,
Master the surfer hair.,
Accessorize with jewelry.,
Move your vibe from the beach to a formal occasion.",How to Look Like a Surfer2," One staple of the male surfer look is the floral shirt. This goes for a classic Hawaiian button up, but can also be a t-shirt with a bold floral pattern. Start with this shirt and build from there.The print doesn’t have to be on your shirt. Try opting for some printed slip-on sneakers.

, Jeans and the beach don’t match. Instead of jeans, try wearing some khaki chinos. Go for a lighter shade and consider experimenting with different beach colors like green and blue.


For an added surfer look, roll the bottom of each leg a little over the ankle, as if you need to keep the edges dry while you’re walking along the beach., If you are on the beach, or even just styling on a hot day, a token element of the surfer style is board shorts. These are banded at the top with a string to tie them together. They come in those bold surfer prints. They rest low on the hips and end above the knee.Shop some of the most popular surf brands like Quiksilver, Hurley, RVCA and O’Niell for the trendiest shorts., Male surfers often have longer and shaggier hair. Consider growing yours out long enough to tousle. You can also add hair product like Surfer Hair Power Putty to give your hairstyle the shaggy surfer look. Apply a dime-sized amount to damp hair, scrunch it up and let it air dry.If you have long hair, try a sea salt spray.
Curly hair is great for a surfer look. Consider enhancing the curls with a mousse for a slightly wet look.

, Some men don’t wear a lot of jewelry, but surfers do. Finish off your look with some bracelets and a necklace. Opt for woven fiber and maybe add some seashells, or a shark tooth necklace., Choose a colored suit, but it should not be too bright. Try green or blue, or tan if the color is uncomfortable for you. The bright color should come from the printed floral shirt you pair with the suit.You can also throw some color and a casual beach vibe into your look by pairing some printed slip on shoes with your suit.
For added floral fun put a tropical flower in your lapel or a printed pocket square in your jacket pocket.

Find the perfect swim suit.,
Protect your skin from a rash.,
Know your wetsuits.",How to Look Like a Surfer3," Surf brands create the most durable suits for the sport. They are designed to be stylish, endure the activity and friction involved in surfing, and to stay on your body when you may not stay on the board.


Men will want a pair of board shorts, which have a band and tie at the top. They are designed to stay on, be less bulky, and dry quickly.Women should opt for a bikini with a medium rise cut to the bottom and a top which either has a criss-cross or racerback.

, There is a lot of friction created between the wax on your board and your body when you are swimming out to the break. It is not always necessary to wear a full wet suit, but you will want to get a rash guard. Rash guards can be worn by men and women and function as a tight fitting shirt to protect the chest, abdomen and arms.Rash guards come in short and long sleeves. Longer sleeves will provide further protection from rashes and sun, but short sleeves are also acceptable.
Women usually wear rash guards over their bikini top.
Your rash guard can match your bikini bottom, but it doesn’t have to. Keep playing with matching similar colors and mixing patterns.

, A wetsuit is not just a wetsuit. They come in different thicknesses, styles and sizes, and have several attachments depending on the temperature of the water you will be surfing in. Make sure you are going to be comfortable.Go to the store and try the suit on. Make sure that you can bend and stretch comfortably. Ask for suggestions on the thickness which will be the best match for the water you will be surfing in.
The colder the water will be, the thicker you want your wetsuit to be in order to hold in more water, which is heated by your body heat. The weight, or thickness can vary in different parts of the suit. A good example of a warm wet suit for cold water is a 6/5/4, meaning it is 6mm in the torso, 5mm in the arms and 4mm in the legs.
Add a hood, gloves and boots for extremely cold water.

Above all, have fun.",How to Improve Your Surf Photography," You want one that has a fairly high speed burst capability of at least 3.3. However, higher is better. This ability will probably not be present in lower end cameras. There are things that you may be able to do to increase its speed.They are:


Locking up your mirror






Eliminating any post processing that you might have set up, in camera





;
, This will allow you the flexibility of taking images fairly close up as well as at a distance.


Get as fast a lens as you can afford.







, You will want extra sturdy ones because you will be out in the field and faster so that it can potentially improve your frames per second.

, Ideally, having both the monopod and tripod, as well as handholding will work the best.

, As with the rest of photography, the 'golden hour' at the beginning and end of the day is the best time. Be ready to get up early and stay out late to get the best shots.

, Are you looking for some great falls or maybe you want to get some shots of surfers angling.Maybe you want to get a shot of someone riding in the big wave. Knowing this will get you more likely in the right place at the right time.

, Don't have all of your photos come from the same place. That can get really boring, really quickly.

, If the two clash, the time to know it is before you take the pictures. There are no 'mulligans' (second chances) in surfing. Maybe they want you to document the day as well as the surfing. Know ahead of time.

, If you need images fast, you can shoot both raw and JPEG, but being out on the water is going to pretty much insure you will get blowouts. If you are using raw images, you will be able to extract at least some of the detail out of that.

, See what others are doing and add to it. Put your own spin on things.

, As stated before, there are no mulligans. While you may want to get 'artsy', don't get carried away.

, If you don't love it, why do it!?

When facing a broken wave, either scratch for the paddling channel or straight out.,
Continue paddling if the broken wave is small.

,
Do a duck dive with small to medium sized broken waves.,
Simply slipping off the board, is a little more work and does not look cool, but is actually very effective in not losing progress going out to the lineup.

,
With big waves, dive for the bottom with or without the board.,
Beware of the reef.",How to Go Through a Broken Wave when Bodyboarding," If it is too late to do this, and there is a rider coming in, avoid the rider. Count on getting splashed if between the rider and the shoulder and count on getting a little smashed, by the wave, if between the rider and the broken wave - 1) slip off the board to avoid the incoming rider or 2) do an Eskimo roll to go through the wave.;
,, For all but the large waves, an Eskimo roll is OK. A board that is turned upside down offers less resistance. Even while grasping the board continue making progress, to the outside, by flutter kicking. The flutter kicking may be the difference between punching through the wave and going over the falls.

,, Without the board hope that the leash holds. Diving for the bottom with the board, hang on to the board as long as possible and then hope that the leash system holds. Here, a board surfer has the advantage over the bodyboarder in that, with the longer ankle leash, the board surfer can dive deeper and escape the main force of the wave. The force of a wave is more on the surface, still, the bodyboarder, even with his short leash, should make the effort to dive down and forward.

, Besides getting cut on the reef and sea urchins, the leash can get tangled in the coral - but this is nowhere a problem as it is for board surfers. Big waves break in deep water but the force of the big wave is so powerful, the fear of meeting up with the reef is there. Watch the tides when bodyboarding in areas with problem reefs.

Recognize that in wakeboarding there are two different types of approaches to the wake: progressive and continuous.,
In order to learn a tantrum, take a continuous approach to the wake.

,
Ride out wide on your toeside edge in order to approach the wake heelside.

,
Flatten out the board and come off your cutting edge (you may drift toward the wake a little).

,
Transition into your cutting edge by leaning back and digging your heels into the water.

,
Edge hard into the wake, sitting back on your heels with your weight over the center of the board.

",How to Execute a Wakeboarding Tantrum1," In a progressive cut, the rider will slowly increase his angle of approach to the wake, therefore increasing his speed of approach, and attempt to pop off the wake while remaining on edge at the most significant angle of approach. In a continuous cut, the rider must transition into his angle of approach quickly and hold that angle (and edge in the water) in order to build enough speed approaching the wake to flatten out or ride through the wake depending on the desired results.;
,,,,,"
"
Appreciate that there are two different ways to throw an invert: with the momentum or against the momentum.,
In order to learn a tantrum, the rider must throw the invert against the momentum.

,
Mark the point you will launch off the wake.

,
Begin standing up out of your cut.

,
Transfer your weight from your knees up and over the center of the board.

,
Throw your back arm up and away from the boat.

,
Follow the movement with your head and the rest of your weight.

",How to Execute a Wakeboarding Tantrum2," When throwing an invert with the momentum, (such as a backroll) the speed and angle of approach of the board are continued through the wake and redirected as desired in the air. When throwing an invert against the momentum, The wake is used as a launching point rather than a ramp and the direction of the board off the wake is opposite the initial approach.

,,,,,,"
"
Stretch out your body and look for the water.

,
Judge your landing and keep your weight over the center of the board.

,
Bend your knees and brace for impact.

,
Watch the water through impact.

Get to know the team.,
Study the history of the organization, and familiarize yourself with former players.,
If you're new to the Shark Tank (SAP Center), refrain from just blurting things out.,
Don not become a fair weather fan.,
Go with the fans!",How to Be a San Jose Sharks Fan,"

Know the key players, including team captain Joe Thornton, Logan Couture, Patrick Marleau, and Brent Burns.



 


Know the role players, including Marc-Edouard Vlasic, Dan Boyle, and Joe Pavelski.






Know the starting goaltender Antti Niemi.






Know the head coach of the Sharks, Todd McLellan.






Know the Sharks' general manager, former Sharks captain Doug Wilson.






Be aware of the team's record. This includes wins, losses, and points, but the most important stat is the team's current position in the standings.





;
, Good names to know include Owen Nolan, Mike Ricci, Teemu Selanne, Sandis Ozolinsh, Arturs Irbe, Mike Vernon, Jonathon Cheechoo, Milan Michalek, Evgeni Nabokov, Rob Blake, and Jeremy Roenick.

, Go with the rest of the crowd. Some things to expect:

If there's a Sharks power play, the Jaws theme will play over the sound system. When you hear it, you'll want to move your arms up and down (in opposite directions) like a jaw.






If the other team is putting on the pressure, and the defense clears the puck away from the goalie and past the blue line, be sure to applaud. This is especially true during a penalty kill. The more pressure that was put on the defense, the bigger the applause.






If you're upset that the other team scored and then are stunned to realize that Niemi made the save, start chanting ""NEMO! NEMO! NEMO!"" (WARNING: Be sure it was a save first. If the red light behind the goal is flashing, the other team probably scored. Starting the chant when there is a goal could bring negative comments from surrounding fans).






During games with the Anaheim Ducks, when you hear a duck call of two short bursts, you should respond with ""Ducks suck!""






Become familiar with Gary Glitter's ""Rock and Roll Part 2,"" which is played after every Sharks goal. Fans will cheer part of the song and shout ""Hey"" while pumping their fists in the air.






When the Los Angeles Kings are playing, it is appropriate to chant ""Beat LA!""







, The Sharks have had good records in recent years, so it's easy to be a Sharks fan. True fans support the Sharks during the hard times too. Leaving the game early when the Sharks are behind is an indicator of a fair-weather fan. Exceptions can be made if it's a complete slaughter (down by 5+), and you can't bear to witness the beating. A true Sharks fan rides it out until the end knowing the Sharks will win!


Be skeptical yet optimistic about the Stanley Cup. The Sharks have a reputation for playing extremely well during the regular season but fizzling out during the playoffs.

, San Jose Sharks fans are known to be the loudest fans in the NHL, so if a road trip is planned (for example, the ""Shark Infestation"" in Anaheim), try to go with them. If you've never been to another NHL arena, it will be a good experience.

Make your love of Cher known.",How to Become a Cher Fan," This will help you when you need to fill up an awkward silence. Sing the words when needed. Warning: Don't sing at the wrong times, such as a funeral or in class. Some people may not appreciate the random Cher lyrics.;
, Study the characters she plays. Also, be sure to watch the movies that she has cameos in. Bonus points if you learn any quotes from a Cher movie. For example, “SNAP OUT OF IT!” from Moonstruck. Caveat: Do not copy Cher and hit someone like she hits Nicholas Cage in the movie. You might lose a friend or a body part.

, There are random items available for purchase on sites such as eBay.

, There are plenty – including an official Cher.com forum that is used by millions of fans daily. Communicating with other fans will allow you to make online friends that love Cher just as much as you do.

, They are usually held in Las Vegas every two years and are attended by Cher fans all over the world. These conventions include impersonators, raffles, and an auction of rare Cher items including her perfume and her fitness videos.

, They are two of the most important things to her and Cher would personally appreciate it if you follow what her children are up to. Chaz Bono is a LGBT activist and Elijah Blue is in a rock band called Deadsy. Go listen to Elijah's music and go read some of the books written by Chaz.

, Therefore, you can wake up and go to sleep and see Cher surrounding you. There are hundreds of posters available. If you check out AllPosters.com, you should be able to find tons of options.

, She is always tweeting, and she will tweet at her fans. If you have a Twitter account, send a Twitter message to @cher and see if she will send you a response back on her account. She gets thousands of messages per day, so good luck.

, This can happen by professing your love for Cher to all your friends and family and making sure Cher is a part of your everyday life. A good phrase that I use occasionally is “Have A Cher Day!”

Sit beside the pool and get to know your mask.,
Get wet!,
Strike a pose.,
Practice clearing your snorkel.,
Relax.,
Practice using the three key fin strokes: the flutter, frog and dolphin.,
Practice the surface dive.,
Now you have armed yourself with the basic skills, keep practicing!",How to Free Dive," The number one rule of free diving is to never dive alone. Make sure you are with someone who knows what you are doing and will be with you the entire time you are in the water. Many places have free diving clubs where you can meet others interested in training. Also check online forums if you don't have any friends who are interested in diving with you.

Learn and practice the ""buddy system"". When diving with a group, always pair up with a buddy. Your buddy is responsible only for you and you are responsible only for him. One is always on the surface while the other is under water.;
, Make sure you have a mask and snorkel before you start practicing in the water. Select a mask that fits well and feels comfortable; you two will be spending lots of time together. When you move onto open water dives, you'll want a wetsuit to provide some protection from the cold; again make sure it fits well. Too tight and it will restrict movement and breathing and can be rather painful; too loose and it won't keep any cold out. A pair of fins will help you make the most of your time underwater, allowing you to swim further with less effort. European-made long fins are ideal for free diving.

, Practice breathing through your mouth with the snorkel. Get used to the feeling of the mask, as it is a strange sensation to start off with.

, Walk into the pool up to your middle and try using your snorkel whilst standing in the water. This can take a long while to get used to, since putting your head under water breathing in is not a natural thing to do. Just take it at your own pace and allow yourself to get comfortable with the whole, strange situation.

, There are two positions free divers use: horizontal and inverted. The first one you'll need is the horizontal position. Hold onto the side of the pool and gently float yourself, face down, in the water. Keep breathing slowly and a little deeper to compensate for the snorkels dead air space.

, As you dive down your snorkel will fill up with water. When you come up to breath the last thing you want after an epic long dive is to come up and empty your snorkel into your lungs! So, while floating in the horizontal position, dip your head under water and let a little bit of water into the snorkel. Use a short sharp breath to clear purge the water and leave you free to breath. Keep practicing this until you are comfortable clearing a full snorkel. You can also remove the snorkel from your mouth before the dive and you will breathe without the snorkel after the dive.

, Now that you're comfortable with your snorkel and happily floating around, it's time to completely relax yourself in the water. While you float on the surface, simply curl up into the fetal position. Some divers will even come close to falling asleep in this position. This state of mind will be your mental base. Recall this feeling when you're diving to keep yourself calm and relaxed and help you dive longer and more comfortably.

, The flutter kick will be your standard way of moving, just like when doing front crawl kick with alternating feet. The frog kick relieves tired muscles after all that fluttering. For short bursts of speed (and pretending to be a mermaid), use the dolphin kick. Use short kicks, make sure the blade doesn't bend more than 30 degrees to decrease energy wastage. Take a cue from the fish—to pick up speed, use rapid small fin beats.

, This is one fluid movement where the diver takes a breath, bends at the waist, and dives vertically below the surface whilst clearing their ears. This technique is complex yet easy to master. Gain some momentum and take a deep breath out then inhale deeply, spreading you shoulders for maximum air intake. Bend at the waist and, keeping one arm at your side, seal the nose pocket of your mask with the other hand for ear clearing (see tips) and raise the opposite leg. Keep practicing until you can get a perfect, vertical descent.

, The key to longer breath hold-times is practice. If you have been practicing so far in a pool (which you better had!) when you first step into the ocean you'll be comfortable and confident, able to calmly purge your snorkel when water gets in, and gently slip beneath the surface to enjoy the incredible world below the waves.

Don't overdo it.",How to Get Your Wife/Girlfriend to Watch Sports," Try to avoid very loud arenas or bars where people are loud and obnoxious. When you're not into sports, it can be annoying to be around people who are fanatic about a certain team. When you start watching sports with her, try to do it at home, with a few people she already feels comfortable with (not your buddies who always spill beer on the couch). You want her to feel relaxed, and associate sports with down time, not time to clean up after you and your friends, or time to watch the kids while you watch the game, or time to put up with incessant howling and cheers.;
, You're not the only one who enjoys eye candy. Sports which display well muscled torsos or legs might be a good introductory choice. Don't pretend you don't know which sports have the most attractive athletes. If you can get her into a sport that you're not particularly crazy about, it might be a stepping stone to your favorite sport. If she's going to take an interest in something she normally wouldn't, you should be willing to as well.
Good examples of sports which show off the male physique might include soccer, gymnastics, basketball, and swimming/diving. Avoid sports in which the object is to cause injury (boxing, mixed martial arts) or sports in which the players often get into fistfights, as these are the stereotypes that cause many people to think athletes aren't worth watching.
Eventually, you can convince her to watch or go to certain games when her ""favorite"" athlete's going to be in it., American football may be fine for you, but most gals will likely get more excited about a well executed high bar release move in a gymnastics competition, or a triple lutz in ice skating. Gymnastics, Greek wrestling, ice skating (no hockey... sorry!), cycling, tennis, logging/lumberjack competitions, basketball, diving, swimming and the like might be good starting places. Choose a sport in which she can be easily impressed without being familiar with the game rules or scoring system.

, With whatever sport you watch with her, explain the strategy or technique going on. Many people don't watch sports because they don't understand how the game works, so while you're cheering because your team just took a huge step towards winning, your significant other might still be confused, trying to figure out what just happened. It's no fun to feel out of the loop. If she's interested enough to ask questions, answer them all. Don't brush her off. Make an investment, here. Be patient and use a friendly tone of voice, even if she keeps forgetting which team is which. She's not trying to annoy you, she's trying to understand what's going on.

, Ask her to play a little soccer, football, or basketball with you. This is another opportunity to teach her about the game. Once she sees how difficult a sport can be, she might appreciate the athletes more. Don't get really competitive, and don't bring your friends. And don't be bossy. Make this a fun time for her. Crack some jokes. Tell her that you'll (insert chore here) whenever she scores a goal or makes a basket.

, Buy her flattering attire with your favorite team's logo. Buy what she is interested in. If she likes socks, get her some team booties. Even if she's not a material girl, the thoughtful gesture will most likely be appreciated, especially if it's a surprise. Encourage her to wear what you bought her and shower her with compliments: ""My wife looks HOT in green, doesn't she?"" or ""You look incredibly attractive in that jersey.""

, Things like cycling and basketball have all female teams that your wife/girlfriend could root for and follow in the standings. This can be a way to introduce her to the sport and get her to watch with you.

, Most of the time, when you watch sports, you're probably with your friends and buddies. Remind your girlfriend or wife that this is a great way to spend more time together, which is key to having a healthy relationship. And be fair--tell her that if she makes a genuine effort to enjoy watching sports, you'll make a sincere effort to appreciate something she likes to do. This brings us to the next step...

, If she doesn't like sports because it's your excuse for not pulling your weight around the house (cleaning up, looking after the kids) or because she doesn't have any time to do the things she likes to do, then none of these steps will work. Help her wash the dishes or feed the kids before the game so you can both relax and watch sports together. Or, let her use your game time to do her own thing. At least she'll then see game time as a positive thing! Another idea is to ""trade"" quality time. If she watches this game with you, you'll watch a particular movie with her. Fair is fair!

, You love sports and are probably excited to share this passion with her, but understand that her level of enthusiasm may never quite match yours. Recognize that her attempt to be interested and watch a game with you doesn't mean she wants to watch every game in the season. Start slowly. Even though this may be difficult for you, she'll probably be more willing to watch sports if it isn't something you try to get her to do every day.

Mute the TV.,
Turn to your local radio station, or a station that usually follows your team's games.,
Watch the game live online.,
Invite a friend to come, watch the game, and poke fun at the mistakes of the announcers.,
Pretend to call the game yourself.,
Be realistic.,
Attend the game.,
Skip the game.",How to Cope with Uninformed Sports Announcers," If you mute the television, you will instantly free yourself from their bad calls, their inane comments, and their clearly scripted background information on players they haven't really got a clue about. Not hearing the uninformed broadcasters obviously helps, but you still want to have some sort of play-by-play audio, so consider the next step in tandem with this one.


Another good alternative is to lower the volume rather than muting it completely. Then, occupy yourself by doing something else like reading or surfing online, and turn it up whenever it appears to be important. You should still be able to notice important moments to raise the volume for.;
, Even if the game is broadcast on national or local radio, you might prefer the radio announcers' approach. It can be a good idea to listen briefly to both the television and the radio announcers to ascertain who is giving better commentary and which is more likely to be more informative for you. If it turns out to be the radio, mute the TV and listen to the radio commentary instead.


Note that your ability to do this will depend on where you live and the sport you're following, as media broadcast deals differ from sport to sport, as well as being dependent on what your region or country usually does with respect to sports broadcasting rules in general.

, Use one of the specially programmed online sites that allow you to watch a game online. You might need to pay but if the announcing is annoying, you could minimize the screen and mute the computer, and do something else while keeping an eye on the game. You might even be able to read blow-by-blow accounts if the site provides them.


Make use of websites such as Twitter and Facebook to discuss the commentary with your online buddies!

, This can be quite a lot of fun at times and will ease your annoyance at the irritating comments made by the announcers. You might even consider holding a competition to see who can spot the most mistakes or bad calls for the entire game. Tally it up at the end and the winner gets shouted a free drink or something else you've decided on in advance.


You could also point out particular over-used catch-phrases, attempts at sounding like they know what they're saying but clearly don't, arrogant comments, self-interested comments, etc.

, It might sound silly, but doing this can be entertaining, with or without an audience. If there are other people watching the game with you, take it in turns to call the game; inject a little rivalry into the commentating by holding a competition for the best home announcer for the game!

, Some of your frustration might be sourced from expecting too much from the commentators when you already know full well that they're not across your team's or player's background and performance history. In this case, instead of getting irritated or frustrated, just accept that there will be a slackening in the quality you'd normally expect but don't let it spoil the game for you.

, If money is no object, and if the game is important, go to the game. Attending a game in person is better than listening to even the best broadcasters and you'll soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the experience first hand.


Know well in advance that there are games you're likely to want to go to so that you can budget for them and set aside savings. If you need to travel, you'll also need to factor in travel and accommodation costs.

, Many of these types of games won't matter much. Stay in-the-know by checking the box score tomorrow, online just after, or by watching the main highlights on your local news station (as they're likely to dub over their own commentary anyway).

Announce your intentions to avoid all spoilers.,
Shun all news outlets.,
Blackout your social media.,
Make your smart phone dumber.,
Consider everyone you will talk to an enemy.",How to Avoid Olympic Spoilers," Use every method possible to let everyone around you know that you do not know, nor do you wish to know, the results of any Olympic events. Post this as your status, tweet it, mass text it, wear a T-shirt if you really want to get the point across.;
, Every news outlet — whether it's online, on paper or just on a screen — is talking about the Olympics. These sites are likely to update as many results as they can as soon as possible. If you want to be able to watch it later, avoid all of these at all costs.



Ignore newspapers. Don't even glance at them when you walk past a newsstand, because most likely, an Olympic event will be on the cover. While it's not updated throughout the day, keep in mind that actual results come out hours and hours before they are even broadcasted. That means newspapers have time to write up the story and have it printed before NBC can even broadcast the performances.

Turn off the radio. Radio talk show hosts are almost exclusively talking about the 2012 Olympics. Use your iPod or turn on Pandora if you need a music fix. Even when talk shows aren't on, you run the risk of an ad or promo for a later show spoiling results.

Pretend you don't even own a television. Don't turn on the TV unless you want the results right then and there. Commercials, promos and actual broadcasts are all dying to bring in viewers by announcing results and breaking down performances. Turn on the TV only when you are ready to tune in for results.

, In an era of where social media reigns supreme and anyone with an internet connection can post whatever they want in seconds, you will need to safeguard yourself from social media ruining your Olympics binge.



Deactivate Facebook. Let's be honest, your friends will post results. You will find out more than you want to know even if you just log on to check your messages. Unsubscribe to notifications. Make your status a statement that declares you are avoiding spoilers. Don't even bother logging on.

Stay away from Twitter. In fact, more tweets went out in the first 24 hours of the London Olympics than the entire duration of the Beijing Olympics. Twitter is the least safe place to ""avoid"" results. Unsubscribe your phone from getting tweets.

Just to be safe, avoid even Instagram and Pinterest. You may think these are safe, but then you see a photo uploaded of standing on the podium listening to 's national anthem with a gold medal around his/her neck. So just to be safe, stay off the boards.

, Smart phones are changing the way information spreads. Now within seconds you can have results texted, and emailed straight to your phone. Here are the best ways to prevent that technology from spoiling the Olympics for you.



Delete applications that may tempt you. Delete any news applications. Keep in mind many of them will send you breaking news that will give away results. You can always add them back later.

If you are hesitant, just destroy all notifications. Go into all of your applications (including social media) and unsubscribe from updates. Even if you are strong enough to not click into the app, a pop-up can easily spoil results.

, Whether or not you like it, everyone else is going to be talking about the games. The more you surround yourself with people the more you are exposing yourself to results. Tell people you don't want to know results — they will probably forget. Tell everyone you have the plague — they won't even talk to you!



Avoid co-workers at all costs. The office is filled with conversation about which athlete is Susanne's favorite, what John would have done if he was Misty May in that set, and who Karen thinks is the most attractive member of the Men's gymnastics team (Hint: the American who ). You can tell people you don't want to know the results, but you still run the risk of over-hearing. Close your office door and keep to yourself. Or create an anti-Olympic-Spoilers club with that guy from HR and Jason from tech-support.

Avoid fellow commuters with headphones. Your iPod is your new smart phone. Cling to it like it has your social security number and mother's maiden name inscribed on the back. Whenever you are around people, especially commuting home, plug in your headphones and create a barrier between you and fellow commuters' conversations.

Desert friends and family who will ruin the games for you. Lesson of the London Olympics 2012: trust no one, not even family. Avoid anyone who you feel can't keep their lips buttoned about results. Make sure to tell people that you still plan on interacting with that you do not want to know who won gold in the Men's 200-Meter Individual Medley (, ).

Learn about the countries that are playing, including their history, culture and political state.,
Analyze the touch of the players.,
Identify the key players.,
Scrutinize the tactics of the teams.,
Observe the speed of play.,
Feel out the emotional level of the teams.,
Delight in the goal celebrations.",How to Appreciate a Soccer Game on TV," How popular is soccer in those nations? Which countries have particular rivalries with each other? Often in the World Cup, former colonies are keen on winning against the country they gained independence from, or have tense environments due to strong political differences and conflicts.;
, Can they control the ball in the air in one touch and then immediately be ready to shoot or pass? Do they control the ball in anticipation of what they want to do next? Can they avoid a defender when pressured, shield the ball and still find an open teammate? Focus in on free kicks and corner kicks, known as set pieces, which often result in goals.

, While watching their moves, try to pick out individuals and understand the roles they each play for the time. In particular, look out for:


The Star - Usually there’s one player who every play the ball runs through. Like Benzema of France, Messi of Argentina, Muller of Germany, Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, or Neymar of Brazil - they run the show for their teams.
The Breakthrough - Identify the upcoming and future stars. There’s usually one new young player that breaks through in the World Cup and dazzles the World, such as Fernando Llorente (Spain), Eden Hazard (Belgium), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (England), or Rafael and Oscar (Brazil).

, Is the team that is winning stalling the game to get the ball for a throw-in? Are they trying to keep possession of the ball rather than go forward? Do they keep possession of the ball and slowly work up the field or do they send a long ball up to the forwards (the best teams do a bit of both)? Watch how teams defend: do they play an off-side trap and move the defensive line up the field or play deeper, compact and near their goal? Do they double team one player when he receives the ball? Are they stretched or organized?

, Good teams vary and control the pace of the game, a few short passes and then a long pass that splits the defense and puts a teammate through with a chance on goal. Great teams play the ball at speed – sharp passes, driven balls, and whipped in crosses. Pay attention to how momentum changes games. They often say the first five minutes and last five minutes of each half are key moments of the game; don’t concede an early goal and look for a late goal when the other team is tired. Teams pounce on other teams just after they score.

, Are the teams playing with energy and being aggressive or sitting back intimidated? Watch how each 50/50 ball is challenged for. Sometimes, a great fight and challenge for a ball is a thing to appreciate, as they jump up into the air to head the ball to a teammate amongst two defenders, an elbow to the face in the process. Listen to when the fans cheer, sing and whistle. Listen to their national anthems. See how the crowd sings, jumps, claps and stands nearly the whole game.

, A goal is hard to come by and a player can be overcome with emotion and deservedly so; a run to the bench to celebrate, a dance, sliding on their chest towards where their fans are located, ripping off the jersey and revealing an undershirt with a message and so on. Don't hold back; if you're excited, show it!

Target your legs.,
Stand next to the edge of the pool.,
Sweep your leg.,
Switch legs.",How to Get Skinny Thighs from Swimming1," This move is perfect for beginners in the pool. It requires no previous swimming experience and can be done in a shallow pool. The leg sweep targets your legs and helps you burn the unwanted fat in your thighs.;
, You want to be up to your chest in water. Face sideways to the edge of the pool and grab the pool’s edge with your hand. Raise your other hand above your head., Sweep the leg furthest away from the pool wall forwards—up to belly height. Keep your leg straight the entire time, engaging your thigh muscles. From here, sweep your leg back behind you, squeezing your glutes. Repeat and continue for 30 seconds., Turn around so that leg you just used for the leg sweep is next to the pool wall. Repeat the sweep for 30 seconds with your opposite leg. Take a 30 second break after you’ve used both legs. Repeat this cycle 10-12 times.


Contract your core to help you burn more calories.
Try using fast-paced music to help you stay upbeat and prevent you from slowing down.

Kick like a dolphin.,
Continue for 30 second intervals.",How to Get Skinny Thighs from Swimming2," This move is a great leg exercise to help you get skinnier thighs. As an added bonus, your core muscles will stay engaged the entire time, helping you burn fat. Even if you aren’t the best swimmer, the wave maker is an easy exercise.

, Walk to water that is chest-deep. Grab onto the edge of the pool deck with your left hand. Place your right hand firmly against the wall just below the water line for stability. Face the fingers of your right hand down to help stabilize yourself., Holding onto the wall for stability, extend your legs behind you to the water level. Keep your feet and knees together. Engage your abs when you lift your legs to this position.

, Initiate the motion with your abs and hips and transfer it through your thighs and knees. Point your toes to help kick as hard as you can., Kick for 30 seconds and take a 30 second break. Repeat as long as you can. If you need to rest for 45 seconds for the last few rounds, do so. Also, if you need to switch positions of your hands, feel free to do it during your rest time.If you can’t make it the full 30 seconds, separate your legs. These kicks are an easier moderation and will help you reach the full time.

Start with realistic expectations.,
Use starter workouts.,
Attempt different strokes.",How to Get Skinny Thighs from Swimming3," Swimming helps you lose weight because it is great cardio that helps you burn calories—which, in turn, burns fat. When you first start swimming with the hopes of getting skinnier thighs, you need to be realistic about your swimming level. It is very, very hard to jump in a pool and swim laps for 30 straight minutes. Your lungs and muscles have to adjust before you can perform at that kind of level., To begin your workout regimen, start by swimming four lengths of the pool at an easy effort. Stop at the ends of the pool to catch your breath if you need to. After your four lengths, rest for 30 seconds. Repeat 5-10 times. Try doing this 3 times a week to build up your swimming muscles.

, Not only will this help you burn more calories, which will make you skinnier, but, it will also keep you entertained. Doing the same motion for 30 minutes, 3 times a week will get very mundane. Keep yourself looking forward to working out by switching up the strokes.


Freestyle is great because it’s easy to learn and burns a ton of calories.The backstroke, with your eyes looking straight up, will help improve your posture.
The breaststroke engages your hip and inner-thigh muscles. These are often missed in other workouts and will help you get the most out of your swim.

Be comfortable in the water.,
Get a spotter.,
Try using a flotation device.,
Align your body with the surface of the water.",How to Float on Your Back1," To be able to float on your back without panicking, you should be calm and relaxed in the water, even if you're not an expert swimmer. You should learn how to float on your back in a swimming pool, not an ocean or a lake with waves. Ideally, you should be reasonably comfortable in water and know how to swim from one end of a pool to the other without needing any help.

If you're floating on your back as a way to learn how to swim, then you should take extra caution and be with your spotter at all times.;
, Don't try to float on your back by yourself for the first time. Even if you've mastered other basic swimming techniques, if it's your first time trying to float on your back, you should not only have a spotter, but make sure that you're in a place with a lifeguard that can come to your rescue if you need the help.


The spotter will place his hand under your back and will let you make the necessary adjustments to your body until you're comfortable trying the technique on your own.

, Using a PFD (personal flotation device) around your arms or mid-section can also make you get more comfortable in the water. If you've worked with a spotter but aren't quite ready to try floating on your back on your own, try wearing the device until you wean yourself off of it.

, Before you begin to float on your back on your own, you need to align your body with the water -- ideally, your body should start off in a position that is almost parallel to the water or bottom of the pool. You can even get on your back and kick off the side of the pool until your body naturally glides with the surface of the water.


Once your body is aligned with the surface of the water and your back is relatively parallel to the water, it'll be much easier to make adjustments to the rest of your body.

Put in the effort.",How to Get Started in Diving," There's no need to start from a diving board, or even a raised stand. Just stand at the edge of the pool's deep end. Always dive from the end of the pool, not the sides.It's tempting to start while standing in water, but resist this urge. The water will drag you down as you jump, and you could hurt yourself if you land on the shallow side.
Make sure no people or objects are in the diving area.;
, To do this, place one hand on top of the other, with your palms facing down. Raise your arms straight above your head, so your biceps squeeze your ears., To help with first dive nerves, get your head as close to the water as possible. Crouch if you prefer to take a smaller dive., Try to dive in headfirst if you can. This is scary at first, but it gets easier with every mistake. Every beginning driver starts out with belly flops and stumbles. Once you realize they are not dangerous, your confidence will grow., Repeat this jump many times, using the same form. Focus on entering the water headfirst and keeping your body straight. Once you can achieve a smooth entry this way, focus on jumping further, or — if you've been crouching — start from a standing position., Visit swimming clubs in your area to find out about their diving classes. To start out, you may prefer an informal club with a relatively large proportion of beginners. Diving schools often focus on competitions, and may not give new divers the attention they need.

Choose an affordable option so you have the flexibility to change your mind.

, Ideally, find a coach with collegiate experience who is still an active diver. Someone with limited competition experience, mediocre diving ability, or poor ability to answer your questions is rarely an effective teacher.

If you're not sure about your coach's ability, talk to more experienced swimmers for advice, or watch his experienced students dive to see whether they have good form.

, The tuck position is a good starting point for competitive divers, allowing them to practice control in the air.Jump from the lowest diving board, then adopt this position in the air:At the top of your jump, squat with your knees up against your shoulders, with your head tucked between them. Round your back and shoulders to make yourself as compact as you can.
At the same time, grasp your legs with your hands just above your ankles. Keep your elbows close in at your sides.
As you rotate forward, straighten out and enter the water in streamlined position, arms first.

, Competitive divers must practice several types of dive. With the help of your coach, practice the correct form for the following:

Straight jump forward and backward
Tuck jump forward/backward
Piked jump forward/backward
Jump half twist (starting forward/backward)
Jump full twist (starting forward/backward)

, Having a good coach is important if you want to do well, but you also have to put in a lot of hard work to become a better diver. In addition to actual diving practice, consider watching videos of Olympic divers and analyzing how you could use their techniques."

Place your ears in the water.,
Lift your chin.,
Make sure the water line is at mid-cheek.,
Stay centered.",How to Float on Your Back2," Though it may not feel comfortable to place your ears in the water at first, just tip back your head until your ears are completely submerged. If your ears are out of the water, it means that your neck will be straining and that your body will be able to float less easily.

, Once your ears are submerged, lift your chin. You can lift it slightly, just an inch or two out of the water, or even lift it much more, so that it's pointing up toward the ceiling or sky. This will help you tip back your head and will make your entire body more buoyant.

, As you place your ears underwater and begin to lift your chin, make sure that the water line is at mid-cheek. It may be slightly lower if you raise your chin more dramatically.

, Keep your head centered so you don't tilt to one side or the other. Keeping your head centered will keep the rest of your body centered.

Position your arms correctly.,
Arch your back slightly.,
Lift your chest.,
Lift your stomach.,
Bend your knees.,
Let your legs dangle down.,
Kick your legs (if necessary).,
Make small adjustments.",How to Float on Your Back3," There are a few ways to position your arms when you're floating on your back. If you're an absolute beginner, you can bend your arms at the elbows and place your palms under your head as if you were doing a sit-up, and then bend your elbows back to force your body to tilt upwards even more. Here are some other things to try as you position your arms:


If you're more comfortable in the water, you can move your arms straight behind your head, mimicking the diving position, which will change your center of buoyancy and will balance out the weight of your legs more.
You can also move your arms straight out or even keep them just a few inches away from your sides.
Whatever you do with your arms, make sure that your palms are always facing the ceiling or sky.

, This will help you tilt your body upward. Just arch your upper back a few inches upward.

, As you arch your back, lift up your chest more so it's out of the water.

, You should also actively lift your stomach until your mid-section breaks the surface of the water.

, Bend your knees to open up your legs a bit. If your legs are completely straight, you'll be more likely to sink.

, After you bend your knees, let your legs dangle down on either side, with at least a few feet of space between them. Your legs won't naturally float to the top of the water. For many adults, the legs are heavier than the arms and upper body, so the legs may naturally float downward. This may be different for small children, who don't have muscular legs.

, If you do feel your body floating downward near your legs, just take small kicks with your legs to keep your body afloat. You can float on your back and then take the kicks whenever you feel your body shifting downward, or just continually lightly kick your legs to avoid the downward shift.

, As you continue to float on your back, listen to your body and see if it's sinking in any place. Continue to kick your feet if you're sinking down near the feet and legs, and gently move your hands and arms in the water if you feel that your upper body is getting out of position. You can also try lifting your chin higher or arching your back a bit more to make your body more buoyant.


If you get out of floating position, just align your body with the surface of the water and try again. Learning to float on your back takes time.

For a tumble turn, use the same method for this forward roll, but, once you have finished the roll, stay under the water, go onto your back, push the wall with your feet and turn back over onto your stomach.

",How to Do a Forward Flip in the Water," Begin by laying out on your stomach in the water. Keep your legs straight and as far out as the water as possible (if you would like to look nice while doing it).;
, Turn your head to the side and take a deep breath in, before you begin your forward roll.

, Pull your knees in towards your chest and tuck your head in. The most desirable roll would include your nose touching your knees. If you would like to look nice, point your toes. Remember to hold this position for the rest of your roll.

, Move your arms in a circular motion forward. Pull the water through and behind you to propel yourself upside down, all while keeping your body tucked in, knees to nose.

, Once you're upside down, push the rest of the water up around you to spin back up right. Continue all the way around until you are vertical once again, but still in tucked into a ball.

, Uncurl your body, straightening your legs and move your head so you are looking straight in front of you.

, Using the flutter kick, propel yourself back to the surface of the water. It is best to stay as close to the surface of the water as you can. It will look prettier and seem more impressive. If you would like to do the roll deeper though, this will still work.

, Come up and enjoy a nice breath of air that you may have been craving throughout the roll. Be careful not to breath in to early though, or you may inhale a big gulp of water.

Hurdle forward.,

Continue rotating backward.,
Begin to extend your legs.,
Stretch your legs into the water.",How to Do a Gainer off of a Diving Board," The hurdle is the jump that will help you gain momentum, moving away from the board and up in the air, in order to have enough room and time to do a gainer. Before you attempt the gainer, you should be comfortable just doing the hurdle into the pool. You should also be comfortable doing a front and back flip. Here's how you do it:


Take a few quick steps toward the edge of the board.
Bend your knees and swing your arms up as you jump off the board
Jump up and out
Tuck your knees into your chest
Fall straight into the water

After you're comfortable with this skill, you can wrap your arms around you knees after you tuck them into your chest.

;
, The board should ideally be about 10 feet (3 meters) above the water. Keep your posture pretty straight but bent you knees just a bit to get comfortable with the bounce of the board. Your arms should hang at your sides.

, Space your steps so that your stronger foot plants last, with your toes planted just behind the front edge of the diving board. These steps should be quick, enough to build momentum, but not so quick that you slip and lose your balance.

, The first main motion for doing the gainer is the hurdle that you've practiced. To hurtle forward, reach the edge of the board with your feet and jump forward as you raise your arms on your last step and raise your knees to the height of your hips or higher. This combination will lift you upwards as high as you can go. You need to jump forward enough that you won't hit your head on the board but focus on going out and up, not just out.

, Your head and chest will stay still as you're propelled forward. Lean back and let your tucked feet fall backwards over your head. Your knees should already begin to move closer to your chest and your arms should approach your knees.

, You should begin to tuck tightly at the height of the jump. Wrap your arms around your knees into the tuck, which will help your body become more compact. You can think of this as curling into a cannonball.

, Keep your body neatly tucked until you approach the water with your feet.

, When you're just 1 to 2 feet away from the water (.3 to .6 meters), you can start to extend your legs, to get ready to land in the water feet first. If you don't do this, you'll land on your face or stomach -- not only will this not look so elegant, but you'll be in pain as your body slaps the water.


Your arms can move away from your knees and approach your sides.

, Right before you enter the water, extend your legs completely as you gracefully land into the water vertically with your feet first. Your arms should be nearly at your sides when you do this.


As you improve your gainer technique, you can work on rotating your body a bit faster and tucking your knees to your chest for longer before you enter the water.

",How to Do a Three Step Hurdle on the Diving Board," This is very important. Roll your ankles in both directions, stretch your calf, you hamstring, your knee, and your toes. Don't neglect upper body, but focus you stretching on the waist down.;
, If your board has a fulcrum, change it to your desired setting. A fulcrum is the wheel shown to the side. It adjust your spring depending on where it is.

, If your board has cheese-holes in the end, then start about 2 inches (5.1 cm) before them. If not, start from about one and a half feet from the end.

, Make the first one a bit longer than your average step, then make the next two normal.

, You have found your starting point. This is where you should always start for a three step hurdle.

, If you want to, otherwise proceed to the next step.

, Start with your non-dominant leg. You should do two normal steps, and then a little bit longer step.

, As your third step touches the board, swing your arms up beside your ears. Bring your knees to waist level at the least.

Enter the water.",How to Execute an Inward Dive on Springboard,";
, Tighten your legs, and stand with your arms raised to you sides.

, Then rise up onto your tip toes while bringing you arms up (either above your shoulders or all the way to your head).

, It is very important to keep your chest and hips over your feet. Dropping your chest forward will cause you to jump into the board (and possibly hit it). Dropping your chest back behind your feet will cause you to jump too far away from the board. Additionally, popping your hips out will pull you away from the board, which reduces the height of your jump. Remember, the higher the jump, the easier the dive.

, The board provides all the power for your jump. Try to get your arms to the top without bending them, as this will reduce the power of the board. Additionally, swing your arms to the top before you stand straight up. The best divers have their arms above their heads before they stand straight up, and are fully extended before their feet leave the board. Remember to keep your hips and chest over your feet as you extend. This will not work perfectly the first time, so do not be discouraged if you need a few practice jumps before attempting the dive.


At this point, the board should throw you straight up into the air. Do not worry about hitting the board. If you do not drop you chest or pop your hips out, then the natural trajectory of the board will throw you to the exact distance you should be away from the board. This distance is a little more than arm's length from the end of the board.

, Since you are facing the board, this is the ""scary"" part of the dive. Again, if you have done the approach/jump properly, then there is no chance of hitting the board.


Should you think that you will hit the board during the dive, simply look down at the board, land with your feet, and fall to the side into the pool. If you are already inverted, then look at the board extend your hand to the board, and palm it while pushing away. This will make you fall backwards into the pool without hitting your head or torso. You may cut your hand if this happens, but it will not be a serious injury.

, Keep your head up, since tucking your chin will stop your rotation, and you will end up with a belly smacker. You should look like you are doing a toe-touch in mid-air, almost directly above the board.

, The goal of every dive is to enter the water straight with minimal splash (canon-balls are not dives so much as they are splash jumps). To get into the straight position, simply bring your arms (straight elbows) up to your head (from the side, not through the middle), and clasp them together by using one hand to grip the fingers of the other (not the thumb). Remember to clasp your hands AFTER you have reached to your feet/toes, not before or during the reach.


If you have not ducked your chin/head, then allow your legs (straight knees, pointed toes, no bend except at the waist) to rise above your torso/head. Both parts of this step occur simultaneously.

, Once you are completely vertical in the air and have your hand clasped, simply keep you head up (it should already be up), and look at the water below. As you enter the water, allow the water to reach past your shoulders before parting  your hands and bringing them back down to your sides (not through the middle). 


Keep your legs straight and your toes pointed, and go all the way down to about the bottom of the pool (you do not need to touch the bottom). This will ensure that you do not over-rotate, or bend your knees while entering the water. Now simply swim back to the surface and give it another try.

Regardless of which leg you lead with, make sure your feet are approximately a shoulder width apart on the block.

, By curling your toes over the edge, you will be able to push off the block with maximum force. Make sure your weight is distributed evenly between your front and back legs to ensure your stability., Make sure your head is down, with your chin resting on your chest, and positioned directly between your knees. Keep your forward knee positioned directly over your toes and your hips positioned directly over your heels.


This will help to ensure your center of gravity is positioned at the edge of the block, resulting in the fastest reaction time.

, Use both hands to grasp it. You will have one hand positioned on each side of your forward leg. Grasp the block with all of your fingers and your thumbs, which will help you generate the most force.


You can rest your thumbs on the top of the block or wrap them in front of it, whichever you prefer.
To generate the most power, it is often recommended that you wrap your thumbs in front., Keep both of your feet facing forward, with your entire body facing the pool. Do a quick assessment of the block and get acquainted with the feel of it. Make sure that you feel completely stabilized before moving into the next position.

, You should place your feet approximately 6 inches apart. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed between your two legs to ensure your stability. Keep your knees slightly bent.

, You can place your hands inside or outside of your feet, whichever is most comfortable for you. You should be leaning forward slightly.

, You want your head tucked as close to them as possible. Your chin should be resting on your chest. You are now in a position of dynamic stability, with your center of gravity allowing you to move forward as rapidly as possible., Both the track start and the grab start require that you lift your hips as high as you can for best results. Position them as close to the edge of the block as you can.


Essentially, your rear should be situated as high in the air as possible.
Doing this, along with tucking your head close to your knees, will help you position your center of gravity and give you the best advantage for a fast reaction time., This will help you keep your goggles on after you hit the water. Losing your swimming goggles during a race can completely throw you off.

, The race will not be started until all of the competitors are ready, completely still and in starting position.


Taking too long to get in a ready position or falling from the block before the official start can result in disqualification.

, Closing your eyes while waiting for the beeper is often recommended because it will result in a faster reaction time. By closing your eyes and focusing on the sound of the beeper, you are removing one of your senses causing the other one to be slightly heightened.


This will increase your reaction time to the sound of the beeper.When practicing, work on increasing your reaction time to the sound of the actual beeper. Practicing will help you to truly develop this skill.

, Pushing off with your hands will tilt your body in the ideal position to thrust with your legs. You want to “explode” upward and outward with your feet and legs when you push off, since you need to generate as much force as possible.


Just as your feet are leaving the block, use your curled toes to give yourself a final push to propel you forward and downward into the water.

, Use the momentum you create by pushing off with your hands to throw your arms forward into this position.


Ideally, you want to be able to “explode” from a bent body position into a streamlined body position in about 1.5 seconds.Look up slightly as you push off. This will force your body to follow the direction of your head.

, You need to do this as soon as your feet leave the block. You want to dive forward with your head between your arms, looking slightly backward. This will get your body moving downward into the water. It will also help you keep your goggles on once you make impact.

, As soon as you push off you will be snapping quickly into the full streamline position. Maintain this position before entering the water by locking all of your major joints - ankles, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders and neck.Hook your thumbs together to keep your arms in the streamlined position once you hit the water.

, Upon impact you should have your feet close together, toes pointed, buttocks tight, chin resting on your chest, eyes looking downward and your arms locked straight behind your ears.

, You will still be holding the “hands on” streamlined position until you are just about to resurface and begin swimming.

, As soon as you hit the surface go from the streamlined position right into your swimming stroke. The momentum you’ve built up will make your first few strokes strong and powerful.

This isn't necessary for the flip, but the effect is somewhat diminished if the whole flip isn't completed underwater.;
, Your back should be perpendicular to the bottom of the pool. Since the force which will generate the flip will come all from your arms, curl your legs to stop them from providing resistance or coming out of the water., Have your palms facing down. You'll use your arms in a sort of doggy paddle to propel yourself in a flip. As you move in the flip, try to keep your arms at your side and parallel to your body, moving them together.

, To initiate the flip, tilt your head back and and start arching your back. Paddle as though you're trying to lay flat, parallel to the surface. Keep your legs curled as you move, and be sure to follow your back/head with your upper arms., Once your back is parallel to the surface, paddle with your arms and arch your head and back to keep flipping. Next is to be perpendicular to the water's surface, head facing the bottom of the pool., Once upside-down in the water, you can extend your arms towards the bottom of the pool for more resistance and leverage. Face your palms forward, and push with your arms until they form a right angle with your body. You should once again have your back parallel to the bottom of the pool, but with your head facing the surface of the water.

, To avoid them coming out of the water, move your arms to side (like a breast stroke) and push down towards the bottom of the pool to right yourself. You should finish in the same position you started in, back straight and perpendicular to the surface of the water."

The Red Cross considers nine feet to be a good depth for diving if you want to be especially cautious, but the diving area in many pools is eight feet deep. Never dive into a pool that's less than eight feet deep.








If you're unsure how deep a pool is, it's best to avoid diving there. It can be hard to gauge a pool's depth just by looking. Find a pool where the depth of the water is clearly marked. In many cases there will also be a sign posted that specifies diving is permitted there.
Avoid diving into lakes, ponds and other natural bodies of water unless the area is supervised and has been cleared for diving. The depth of the water in these natural places is very inconsistent, and there may be boulders hiding in the water that you can't see from the shore.;
, Many beginner divers, especially kids, are afraid to dive at first. It makes sense, since in any other situation launching toward something headfirst would result in pain and injury. If you're nervous about taking the plunge, try these techniques to feel more comfortable with the idea:









Jump into the water feet first, so you get used to the feeling of entering water from a height. Sometimes kids think that water is hard, so it can help to point out to them that it's soft as you encourage them to splash around.
Practice falling while you're in the water. Stand up in the water and let yourself fall forward, then let yourself fall backward. See how the water ""catches"" you and prevents you from getting hurt.

, Since diving can be intimidating when you're a beginner, it helps to practice on land and visualize how the dive will go before you enter the water. Stand upright with your arms straight above your head, your upper arms hugging your ears. Keep your hands flat and place one palm over the other. Tuck in your chin. This is the way your upper body should be composed when you dive into the water.









You can practice the motion of diving on land as well. Find a grassy area or practice indoors on soft carpet. Get down on one knee and angle your arms and fingertips toward the ground. Roll forward so that your hands touch the ground, followed by your arms. Keep going until you're flat on your belly.
Remember to hold your hands flat and place one on top of the other, rather than clasping them. Tucking your chin into your chest is equally important. These actions help to streamline your body, making your entry into the water smoother.

, Stand with your toes slightly over the edge of the pool, and crouch down close. Put your arms in position over your head - remember to tuck in that chin! - and point your hands toward the water. Now rock your body forward and gently glide into the water headfirst. As your legs follow your upper body, straighten them out and point your toes.









As you enter the water, exhale, then hold your breath. You might accidentally inhale underwater if you feel startled, but once you get the hang of diving it'll feel natural to hold your breath.
Practice diving from a crouch until you feel completely comfortable entering the water this way. Once it starts to feel easy and you're ready to move on, you can dive from a standing position.

, When you're ready to try it standing up, edge close to the pool so that your toes are at the edge. Get your arms and hands in position and bend at the waist, pointing your fingers toward the water. Tuck in your chin, then tilt forward into the water. As your legs follow your upper body, keep them together and point your toes.









Consider having a spotter help you the first few times. The act of diving from a standing position can be a little intimidating, and it might help to know that someone else is there to help you. Have the person stand next to you and place one hand on your belly and the other on your back, so that he or she can guide you into the water.
Once you can dive from a standing position without needing a spotter, you're ready to advance to learning a proper dive using the correct form. Soon you'll be leaping into the water without a second thought!

, If you're right-handed, your lead foot will be your right foot, and if you're left-handed it will be your left foot. Place your lead foot slightly in front of your back foot, so your toes slightly jut over the pool. Your back foot should be flat on the ground, with your weight balanced equally over your feet. This is the starting position for a dive.









As you work on your diving form, try to start with your feet in the exact same place every time. If you dive off of a diving board you may want to mark the spot where your feet should go to help you practice.
Once you're comfortable diving from a stationary position, you can work up to doing a walking or running dive. This involves taking three or five steps forward, then leaping off of your lead foot into your dive.

, Just as you did when you first practiced on land, raise your arms above your head, with your elbows straight. Tuck your upper arms against your ears. Hold your hands flat, with one palm resting over the back of your other hand. Hold your arms and hands in this position until you're ready to dive.









As always, remember to keep your chin tucked down to your chest.
If you do a walking or running dive, you'll start with your arms at your side, but they should always end up in an upright position before you enter the water.

, Rather than tipping forward and falling in, push off with your lead foot to add distance to your dive. Enter the water fingertips first. Keep your body straight as you dive, with your legs together and your toes pointed. Once your body is fully in the water, you can start swimming or immediately come up for air.









Remember to exhale as you enter the water and hold your breath while you're in. You should be able to swim around for several seconds before needing to surface.
Try walking or running into your dive if you want to dive further and faster. No matter how you start your dive, your body should always enter the water at the same angle and using the same basic form.

, In competitive swimming, races begin with a dive off of a starting block, raised slightly above the surface of the pool. To dive from this position, you start in a crouch, gripping the edge of the block with both your fingers and your toes. When the starting bell or shot sounds, you spring into a low dive and start swimming the moment you hit the water.









When you're diving off of a starting block, it's important to streamline your body so that you enter the water with as little splashing as possible. Keep your body in a straight line and point your toes. This will minimize the water's drag on your body so you won't lose precious seconds during the race.

, When you've gotten comfortable from diving from the side of the pool, you might want to try it from a diving board. Diving off the low board isn't too different from the side of the pool, but the high board is a different story. It's usually about 10 feet (3.0 m) above the water, and requires climbing a ladder to get to the top.









Make sure the high dive is above very deep water, since you'll be entering the water faster. The water should be at least 12 feet (3.7 m) deep to be on the safe side.
You can use the same basic diving form to dive off the high dive as you'd use any other time. The key is to enter the water at an angle that gives you a smooth entry. If you lay out too flat, you'll end up doing a painful belly flop.

, This is the proper term for starting a dive from a walk or run. You take three to five steps, followed by a one-legged jump before entering the water. Hurdling is done before any type of advanced dive that requires gaining height in order to move or contort your body before you actually enter the water. To hurdle, do the following:









Start at the back of the diving board and take three to five steps. Three will give you plenty of momentum for a good hurdle, but you can take five if you have shorter legs or feel more comfortable taking more steps.
On the last step, you should be near the end of the diving board. Lunge and jump, swinging your arms upward at the same time. Don't jump off the diving board; jump straight into the air.
Land on the diving board with your feet in position to dive and your arms over your head. Now you're ready to jump off of the diving board and execute your dive.

, This advanced dive looks elegant and is a good next step once you've mastered the basic dive. Your body will rise up from the board, fold forward at the hips, then straighten into a dive. To do a jackknife, follow these steps:








Begins with a hurdle. Take three to five steps, lunge and jump, and land on the edge of the board with your arms over your head. Jump off and slightly away from the diving board.
Raise your hips above shoulder level as you jump off the board.
Reach your arms down toward your toes. Your body should look like and upside-down V.
Straighten your body to complete the dive.

Stand facing away from the water, feet halfway on the diving board.,
Keep your arms at your sides and your back straight.,
Rotate your arms a full circle.,
Right before the rotation ends, bend low and prepare to jump.,
Jump up and slightly out away from the diving board.,
Tuck your knees to begin rotating.,
Complete your flip.",How to Do a Back Flip in the Water2," At the edge of the diving board, dangle your heels off but keep a firm stand on the board. Push yourself up and down with your feet to get a feel for the spring of the board., This is how you'll prepare your flip. Once you've got a feel for the spring of the diving board, raise your arms above your head. The motion of your flip will be begun by the rotation of your arms backwards, beginning from their position above your head.

, With your back straight and head neutral, start with your arms above your head and rotate them forcefully backward in a full circle. Your arms should finish their rotation where they began, above your head. Continue rocking the board with your feet halfway off., Just as your arms are about to reach their position above your head, bend low (keeping your back straight) to prepare your jump. Be sure to time your coming jump with the spring of the diving board., Once in the air, begin to arch your head and back backwards (away from the diving board). Keep your legs extended and at an angle, pointing towards the diving board. Think of being aerodynamic in these first moments, as you try to gain height from the board.One of the most common mistakes in the jump is an instinct to toss your head backwards and move your hips forward to imitate the coming flip. Avoid this: it may cause you to lose distance between yourself and the board, risking collision.

, Your arms should be above your head; push them back in a forceful semi-circle so that they're close to perpendicular to your torso. Once you've completed the semi-circle, bend your legs quickly and bring your arms down to your legs, grabbing your shins.Once tucked, your back should be parallel to the pool and your head should be facing the side of the pool opposite the diving board. Continue to throw your weight backwards as you rotate.

, Once in a ball, you can just finish your flip by continuing into the water. Once your comfortable with the flip and feel you've got the right height, you can finish by coming out of the ball. At this point, you should see the pool as your continue the flip, the next thing you see being the diving board.


To finish extended, get out of your tuck position once you see board again after your forming into a ball. Try and land your legs at an angle in the water to complete the rotation motion. Have your arms at your side when you enter the water."

Add the rest together.,
Multiply by the degree of difficulty (DD).,
Add final scores as the event continues.",How to Calculate Diving Scores1," Each judge rates the dive from 0 (""completely failed"") to 10 (""excellent""), using half-point increments. This is based on how well the diver performs, from his starting position to entry into the water. The judges do not take difficulty into account for this score.


Example: a diver receives execution scores of 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.0.;
, This step depends on how many judges there are:



Seven judges: Cross out the two highest and the two lowest scores.

Five judges: Cross out the highest and lowest scores.

Three judges: Use all three scores.
Example: There were seven judges, so cross out two scores on each end: 6.5, 7.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.0.

, Find the sum of the remaining scores.


Example: 7.0 + 7.5 + 7.5 = 22.0

, Each attempted dive has a degree of difficulty calculated in advance. This is based on many factors, such as the number of twists and somersaults and the take-off and entry positions. Multiply your last sum by the degree of difficulty to get the final score for this dive.


Example: Let's say the diver attempted an inward 2½ somersault dive in the 10 meter competition, in the pike position. This has a difficulty score of 2.8. Multiply this by the execution score to get the final score: 22.0 x 2.8 = 61.6.

, Calculate each dive's final score using the same system. To determine an athlete's score for the whole event, add the final score for each dive.


Example: If a diver dives three times with scores of 61.6, 50.9, and 54.3, the diver's score for the event is 61.6+50.9+54.3=166.8.

Choose the Proper Thickness - The thickness is probably the most important factor that will determine your comfort underwater.,
Pick Your Style - There are several choices to make here.,
Check Quality of Construction - This will determine how long that wet suit will last.,
Get the Right Fit - If you haven't worn a wetsuit before you will think you have the wrong size on.,
Check Type of Neoprene - The type of neoprene your suit is made of affects the quality of the suit and the price.",How to Buy a Wetsuit," The thicker the wetsuit, the warmer you will be. Choose the thickness based on the type of water and diving you will be doing. Here's a general guide to help you determine what might be the proper thickness for your wetsuits:


2 mm: Water temperatures above 29 C (85 F)
3 mm: Water temperatures between 21-28 C (70-85 F); this is usually the norm for scuba diving in the Caribbean
5 mm: Water temperatures between 16-20 C (60-70 F)
6.5 mm Water temperatures between 10-20 C (50-70 F); at the lower end you are getting into dry suit territory.;
, Do you want a full wet suit or a shortie (has short arms (usually) and legs that end just above the knee)? Do you want a farmer john or jane (a two piece suit - one piece has long legs with a sleeveless top; it is usually worn with a covering jacket)? Do you need a hood? A shortie is for warm water diving.It does leave your arms and legs exposed to the water so you have to decide if it will be warm enough for you. A full scuba diving wet suit is probably the most common/popular.This style is one piece and has long arms and legs. Buying a wetsuit hood is not necessary (for most people) for diving in warm water. It is more for cold water diving.


Surfers, windsurfers and so on tend to prefer shorties.

, Most importantly, you need to check the seams of the wet suit. The cheapest and least strong is a glued stitch. It will sometimes have a piece of glued tape over the seams which will help with comfort. While it is adequate, it will probably give out the quickest of all the seams. Another of the basic stitches found mostly in ""bargain"" and ""cheap"" wet suits is the over-lock stitch which joins the neoprene a the seam by stitching the edges together. The ridge is on the inside of the suit which can become uncomfortable. If this seam is stretched to its limit the seam may open up and let in some water. At the other extreme of construction quality, is the blind stitch. Here the material is first glued and then stitched on one side. However, the stitch doesn't pierce the material which would give an entry point for water. The same stitch is then done on the reverse side and interlocks with the first stitch. This gives the strongest seam. This type of construction is found on the more expensive suits. In between, is the flatlock stitching which you will find in many warm water wet suits. The two pieces of neoprene overlap and are joined together. Unlike the over-lock stitch, the seam lays flat making it more comfortable for the diver. While water can sometimes seep through these seams when stretched, it will be much less than with an over-lock stitch. Taped seams, with any of these stitches, helps prevent water leaking through the seams. It also helps the comfort factor making the suit more comfortable against the skin.

, Scuba diving wetsuits feel snug on you and you will probably feel that you have a reduced range of motion. This is normal.Of course, the wetsuit fit shouldn't be so tight that you have trouble breathing or your movements are overly restricted. You also don't want your wetsuit fit to be too loose. This would let water flow freely through the suit and you would lose all the benefits of the trapped water being warmed by your body. For a correct wetsuit fit, your wrists and ankles should be snug. This is an area where water can easily seep in so these should not have gaps. The neck should also be snug but remember, you need to breathe! Not too tight. There should not be any large gaps in the underarm or crotch area. You will, however, probably have a gap at the small of the back. This isn't unusual and you can always have it altered if it bothers you too much.

, The highest quality neoprene is gas blown and made with thousands of little bubbles of nitrogen gas. While it will compress and eventually wear out like all neoprene, it is the most durable type of neoprene. A chemical blown wetsuit feels softer but will not be as durable.

Multiply by the degree of difficulty (DD).,

Add the scores for each attempt by the same pair of divers.",How to Calculate Diving Scores2," In synchronized diving events, a separate panel of judges scores each diver's execution. These scores are based on the diver's form during take-off, dive, and entry. This score is not (yet) adjusted for difficulty of the dive or how well the two divers synchronized.


Depending on the event, there may be three scores for each diver, or two.
Example: Diver A receives execution scores of 7.0, 7.0, and 8.0. Diver B receives 7.5, 7.5, and 7.5.

, In order to reduce the effect of bias or unusual decisions, some of the highest and lowest scores are discarded. This depends on how many judges are at the event:



11 judges (3 execution scores per diver): Cross out Diver A's highest and lowest score. Cross out Diver B's highest and lowest score.

9 judges (2 execution scores per diver): Cross out the highest score and lowest score of the four, no matter which diver(s) they belong to.
Example: Since there are three scores each, cross out the highest and lowest scores for each diver: 7.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 7.5, 7.5, 7.5.

, An additional five judges each award a score for synchronization, or how well the divers coordinate during take-off, dive, and entry.


Example: the same divers received synchronization scores of 6.0, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5.

, Unlike the execution scores, this system is used for both 11-judge and 9-judge events.


Example: Ignore the lowest and highest results: 6.0, 6.5, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5


, Add together both divers' execution scores, as well as the synchronized scores. Ignore all crossed-out results.


Example: Remaining scores are 7.0 (Diver A execution), 7.5 (Diver B execution), 6.5, 6.5, and 7.0 (synchronization). Add them together: 7+7.5+6.5+6.5+7=34.5.

, Each attempted dive has a difficulty rating assigned in advance according to specific rules. Even if the divers did not manage to complete the dive perfectly, their score is multiplied by this degree of difficulty.


Example: Let's say the attempted dive had a 2.6 degree of difficulty. Multiply your last result by this number: 34.5 x 2.6 = 89.7.

, To get the final score, multiply your answer by 0.6 (or 3/5).This makes up for the fact that synchronized divers receive 5 judge scores (after discarding outliers), while individual divers only receive 3. After this adjustment, scores from both types of events fall in the same range.


Example: Multiply 89.7 * 0.6 to get 53.82, the final score for that dive.

, Calculate the score for each attempt using the same process. As the event continues, add the scores for each dive from the same pair.

Establish a relationship with a bookmaker.,
Travel to a legal state.,
Understand the law.,
Go online to gamble.",How to Bet on Baseball Games1," While you can only legally place bets with a bookmaker in a handful of U.S. states.

You’re advised to take caution if you approach a bookmaker through the black market.


You will be responsible to follow through with any bets you’ve made.
If you can’t afford the cash for the bet, don’t place the bet. You don’t want to risk having a bookmaker and their associates upset with you.;
, There are several locations throughout the U.S. where you can place legal bets. The following states are legal to bet on baseball: Nevada, Oregon, Delaware, and Montana. There are also several Native American casinos that allow legal wagers on sports.


Research the Native American casino because they might not have a bookmaker for baseball.

, The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act confines legal sports betting to Nevada, Oregon, Delaware, and Montana.Several states have attempted to repeal the act for tax benefits of regulated gambling. If you don’t live in one of the confined states as decreed by the act, you are illegally gambling.

, Online gambling is regulated from state to state. Some states have banned online gambling, but they actively go after the bookmakers and not the players. No one has been charged with a criminal act for placing a bet on the internet.If you use a site located offshore that is licensed in a jurisdiction that allows for legal online gambling, you will not be breaking any laws as these sites are not subject to US law.

Know at least a few others to demonstrate your true fandom.


Recognize some of the famous historical players who have played with the team. Although there are some that are as big as Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, and Joe DiMaggio, there are others such as Mariano Rivera, Yogi Bera, David Cone, David Wells, Phil Rizutto who played with the team, following with Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neil, Buck Showalter, Roger Clemens, Mike Mussina, Hideki Matsui, Tino Martinez, Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, Robinson Cano, Ichiro Suzuki and Don Mattingly (who later became the head manager of the Miami Marlins) and countless others.Get used to the name Brian Cashman, the name of the General Manager of the Yankees, who is the manager who elects to sign players to contracts, who has been the New York Yankees General Manager since the 1998 season. He's the person to watch and hear about when big news strikes of big trades and big free agent signings. And yes, you'll hear this name a lot if you are a true Yankees fan!;
, Recognize that most-often the Yankees lineup tries to stay constant, though there are times when the lineup changes due to health issues, which have impacted the Yankee team greatly from 2013 going forward., It's not just about the big names that make this team what it is today. Like all sports, it's a combined effort and if just one player is down, the rest of the team slumps. (If one player is unhealthy, the rest of the team will show this health problem; as it has in both the 2014 and 2015 seasons.) The Yankees have gone through various health constraints that led to some rather nasty losses where they could (and should) have won.


Look towards the use of our current Catcher Gary Sanchez, a former Yankees prospect who came up and immediately starting making a name of himself by hitting home runs, grand slams and even bringing in many runs in many tight situations that helped the Yankees win following all the devastating moves the Yankees were forced to make in 2016 due to the departure of several key players. He was also the runner up in the Rookie of the Year voting in November 2016 - he was just that outstanding. Aaron Judge who came up in the same games with Gary Sanchez, started out really good but cooled off and ended up playing hurt and later ended up finishing the 2016 on the disabled list for the remainder of the season (elbow.)
In December 2016, the Yankees picked up left-fielder Matt Holiday in hopes of grabbing more home runs and hits. Perhaps this will be the break the Yankees were looking for to back their young players with star talent.

, Each year, the Yankees elect five players (the maximum number of starting rotation players allowed by MLB) who go out there at a set schedule to pitch in a series of a few games then try to repeat the performance over and over again throughout the year. Although the Yankees schedule differs from team to team and location to location and from year to year, the 180 games tend to be more than needed to get them into the best position in the standings for them to win their division (or come darn close to it) in that year's schedule. This rotation changes depending on what manager Joe Girardi needs in his players at that point in time each year, though he does try to elect a rotation during and in the days leading up to the regular season. These players include Masahiro Tanaka, C.C. Sabathia, Luis Severino, Michael Pineda, and a wealth of other pitchers who are coming up from the Triple A ball club in Scranton-Wilkes Barre, PA., Although the Yankees obtained Aroldis Chapman again, after picking him up in December 2015 and trading him to the 2016 World Series Champion Chicago Cubs, he comes to the Yankees again and is stoked for the 2017 season. Days before he was traded to the Cubs, he threw his fastest pitch of 104 miles per hour. As part of history, the closer role has been held by such players as Mariano ""Mo"" Rivera and John Whettland - but both of these retired as a Yankee (Mariano Rivera), or were traded to other teams and later retired(John Whettland). There have been others who in past years have come up and tried to help close games but were unsuccessful and are no longer with the Yankees. We also formerly had Andrew Miller and David Robertson both of whom we lost.

, It's not just about the players who come out onto the field day-after-day-after-day until they get hurt. There are ""substitute""-like players who work behind the scenes waiting for ""just that right moment"" to make their appearance when the manager Joe Girardi has to fill in these missing players.

, Joe Girardi has been the manager of the New York Yankees since 2008, and although his first year with the team ended up with the Yankees missing the playoffs, in 2009 the New York Yankees won the World Series, the best ""trophy"" that is well deserved in baseball for the best team around.


Believe it or not: Joe Girardi was once an MLB player for the Cubs, Yankees, Rockies, Cardinals and a bunch of other teams, had helped the team win several World Series rings (Yankees) as he caught the balls as their catcher..

, Although these coaches do change to names that are rather mistakable every year, recognize the pitching coach and batting coach as they come out to speak to the players. These two coaches include the hitting/batting coach Alan Cockrell and pitching coach Larry Rothschild, Although few people know the trainer's name (Steve Donohue), it's good to know what this person looks like because you'll occasionally see them help their players off the field when the player gets injured on the field if you attend a game, or hear/read the newspaper and see their name for something they acted upon when health issues strike the team.

Learn about the Bleacher Creatures who used to sit in the stands and bring stadium-goers into the action with chants that still ring in most Yankees fans heads regularly. , This is the best place to find out news on the team's conditions and status of it's players and who's going where and what's happening. This filtered log can be found online at here.

, As with all MLB teams, the New York Yankees have a variety of locations they use for a farm system including their Gulf Coast League affiliate, all leading to their closest and next-level down from professional league at Trenton. Their affiliates can be found under ""Affiliate Information"" here. These teams include the Pulaski Yankees of the Rookie League, the Staten Island Yankees, Charleston RiverDogs and Tampa Yankees of the Single A leagues, Trenton Thunder of the Double A league and their Triple A (and close to professional league yet still not quite) the Scranton-Wilkes Barre RailRiders.


Get to know the ""up and coming names"" of those in the farm system. These players become more later, if and when they arrive at professional level. Some of the Yankees top prospects are listed here, though some have tried out professional and couldn't compete or were injured and are rehabbing after surgery so were demoted back down to the minor league affiliates again until they performance can become back up to professional level.

, Although George Steinbrenner, the former New York Yankees' owner passed away just recently (as of the 2016 season), Mr. Steinbrenner's son Hal was able to take over and now has full ownership over the New York Yankees.

, This will show that you know the team and are involved enough to have a favorite player. Have a reason for choosing your favorite player: a play at a specific game, a skill or talent they have, their character or gamesmanship, etc. Most people prefer Derek Jeter or Alex Rodriguez, but you can like whomever you wish.

, 2004 World Series winners, the bloody sock, Fenway Park, Carlton Fisk, Big Papi. These words will get any Yankee fan/Red Sox hater riled up. Know that Yankee fans hate Red Sox fans and vice versa. If the Red Sox fans use these attacks, just use the 27 World Championships, 1978, Bucky Dent and a first pitch walk off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 7 to Aaron Boone in the 2003 ALCS to formulate a comeback.

, The Yankees have a big rivalry with the Red Sox but that is not their only big rival. The crosstown New York Mets play the Yankees in several games per year (several games at Yankee Stadium and several games at Citi Field) in what is known as the Subway Series, and is considered important for Big Apple bragging rights. In 2000, the Yankees and Mets met in the World Series for the first time; the Yankees won in 5 games to claim their third straight title. Another team that has become a big rival lately is the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, as they have eliminated the Yankees in the playoffs twice in the 2000s and are the only team to have a winning record against the Yankees since their dynasty began in 1996. The Tampa Bay Rays, who have now shown to be contenders, are also growing rivals because an enormous number of Yankee fans attend games at Tropicana Field.

, Did you know that the Yankees had a huge rivalry with the Kansas City Royals back in the '70s and '80s? In the years leading up to the Royals' 1985 World Series, the two teams often were pitted against each other in intense playoff matchups. Surprise people by knowing such an extensive part of Yankees history like this, and other things as well. However, be sure not to make a fool of yourself and claim that the two are still rivals, because they aren't. The downfall of the Royals have made most fans of both teams completely forget about this rivalry until it is mentioned in the newspapers or on some websites occasionally.

, Check out the external links, read the New York Times' sports section. If you want to know about the Yankees' chances of winning each season, learn about other teams and their players, as this will give you a good idea of what games the Yankees can win, and which ones they can't.

, The Yankees are an old team with a very rich history, and they also tend to have some of their own traditions. For example, try getting to a game when they have their annual ""Old Timer's Day"", where some of the Yankee greats from the past century have been there. It is a tradition that many teams have tried to do, but none have been as consistent as the Yankees. You can find out about Old Timer's Day and other Yankees promotions on the YES Network.


Visit Monument Park at least once in your life. If you a dedicated Yankee fan who isn't planning on attending a game, a Yankee Stadium Stadium tour will get you to see this area. Numbers of famous Yankee players that have been retired are included there, and some can be almost immortalized in this area. However, if you are planning to watch a game, come past the area behind Center field to see this famous area.

, A lot of baseball fans (especially Red Sox fans) say the Yankees won their past championships (e.g. 1998, 1999, 2000, 2009, etc.) because of their high payroll. However, this is not the case. Others argue that they won because of the Yankees' willingness to stay true to the team and play their best.

, This can help you hold your own in conversations with even lifelong die-hards.

,, This can result in a sharing of enthusiasm about the team, or during the club's more worse hours: a shared sorrow. Regardless of which feeling it is, it is better to not go through it alone.

, Tickets can be purchased directly from the Mets online, at the stadium box office in person, or from a secondhand ticket seller such as StubHub.


Getting to a game can be a great way to spend time with Mets fan friends you have, or to meet new friends who support the Mets!

Choose to moneyline.,
Understand the moneyline terminology.,
Place a wager.,
Understand the odds.",How to Bet on Baseball Games2," The simplest bet for the beginning gambler or amateur to baseball is a moneyline wager. People choose moneyline betting because it caters more to baseball scoring than other forms of betting. You can choose between the favored team or the underdog and place an appropriate bet. The underdog team is made cheaper to wager on.


Moneyline betting typically is wagered in $100 dollar increments. To win this amount you will usually need to wager a higher number.
Be sure you can afford a moneyline bet before getting involved.
Moneyline is the most popular form of gambling for baseball.

, Moneyline has a numerical technique that differs from basketball or football, where a team is favored by points. Favored teams are valued with a negative value and the underdog team is placed with a positive value. To profit from the the value of -130, you need to wager $130 to win $100. To profit off the underdog with a value of +165, you have to bet $100 to receive $165.


Think of 100 in between the two values, like +165 +100 -185.You’re meant to risk more for the favored team.

, Take a look at the odds board and see which team is favored and which team is the underdog. Use this information alongside your prior knowledge of the players and performance history. If you are a Cubs fan, and they are projected as the underdog, decide if you want to bet against your home team.

, Bookmakers include the starting pitcher in their published lines. The starting pitcher has the most single handed effect on the game in terms of wagering. It helps if you watch the game religiously before beginning to place bets, unless you have the means to gamble loosely.

Choose to runline.,
Understand runline terminology.,
Place a runline bet.",How to Bet on Baseball Games3," Runline gambling is a combination of moneyline and a point spread system. This type of betting is only recommended for the most serious baseball aficionados. Runline requires a prior knowledge of stats, trends, and pitching performances. Runline brings a familiar element to sports bettors who favor wagering on football and basketball based off adding or losing points. Points translate into runs for baseball., The key to understanding runline is to understand baseball’s scoring technique. A run is a point awarded when a player successfully makes it around the bases before three outs. The favored team is presented as a negative, like -1.5, and the underdog is attached to a positive value, +1.5.


With a 1.5 odds, the favored team needs to win with 2 runs or more, and the underdog team must lose by one run or win the game., Some bookmakers won’t have runline bets as an option since it isn’t as popular in baseball. You can always ask your bookmaker if it’s possible to place a runline. Look at the odds and compare them to your preferences.


For example: A bet on Cincinnati would require that the favored team, Cincinnati, to win the game by two runs to cover the spread and pay out the bettor. If the final score was Cincinnati 4 Chicago 2, $55 laid on the Reds would pay out $50 for a grand total of $105 at the window.
In contrast, if the final score was Cincinnati 3 Chicago 2, the Chicago runline bet would pay out as Chicago was given -1.5 runs. If the runline final score is Cincinnati 3 Chicago 3.5. In that situation, $50 laid on the Chicago would result in $110 at the window - $50 bet plus the $60 runline.

Acquire a scorecard.,
Fill out the scorecard with the necessary circumstances of the game.,
Write each player's jersey number, name, and position number in the slot, with one player per two or three slots (or one per ""big square"").,
Keep track of balls and strikes in the given grid.,
Note the outcome of the at bat using both abbreviations and markings on the small diamond.,
At the end of an inning, mark the necessary statistics in the boxes provided underneath the column.,
When a player is substituted in, write their name, number, and position below the player that they went in for and draw a vertical line in between the innings that it happened.,At the end of the game, feel free to tally batting statistics and pitching statistics in the spaces provided for a good representation of the game.",How to Mark a Baseball Scorecard," Most higher-level stadiums sell them, either on their own or along with a program of some sort. If you're unsure of the availability at the stadium you'll be going to, with a quick online search you can easily find baseball scorecards to print out and take with you to the game.;
, This may include, but is not limited to, the teams playing, the lineup, the umpires, the field, the start time, and the coaches.

, For help with the position numbers, see the ""Player information"" table below.


If someone has a designated hitter, write the DH in the first slot and the position player in the second slot.






If needed/desired, write the bench players on the bottom of the scorecard, with one for every slot. This is only if you have trouble remembering who else is on the team in case they come in for a substitution. There is no need to write their position, as they are not yet in the game.







, Balls are kept in the row with three squares and strikes in the row with 2.


You can use checks, slashes, X's, numbers, or whatever you're comfortable with. Some people use different slashes and X's to indicate whether the batter swung or made contact, while others use numbers to indicate in what order the pitches were thrown. This is especially useful as it allows others to see the evolution of the at bat.






If a foul ball is hit with two strikes, simply make a dot (or number, depending on your style) extending from the row of strikes. Continue this as needed.







,


If the batter is out, feel free to write the outcome in big letters over the diamond and be sure to mark (in the bottom right corner of the box) what number out they are of the inning (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). See the table below on ""Ways of Making an Out"" for the standard abbreviations.






For double and triple plays be sure to mark the outs in the order that they happened in the small box in the lower right hand corner.
If the batter gets on base first, draw straight lines on the small diamond indicating the path of the batter. On the side of the last line, write one of these abbreviations in small letters next to it.






Put asterisks (*) or exclamation points (!) whenever a fielder makes a spectacular play.






Some people like to draw where the ball is hit for greater accuracy. They usually draw a line originating from home plate to the spot where the ball is hit, with a solid line for a ball in the air or a dashed line for a ball on the ground.






If, during any point after the ball is put in play, a runner scores, then mark down how many RBI's the batsman gets in the space provided. If none is provided, write it under the diamond.






Track the progress of the runners using a similar set of abbreviations and lines indicating the runner's progress and how that progress occurred (i.e., if the runner moves from first to third on a single draw a line from first to second and second to third and write 1B in the upper left hand corner).






Whenever a runner scores, shade in their diamond for easier reference.







,


If a team hits around the order, simply give multiple columns to that inning and rewrite the numbers accordingly.
You can keep track of writing the number of pitches thrown that inning by writing it to the left of the inning number. You can keep track of the total pitches thrown by writing it to the right of the inning number.

, Also fill in the innings box in the space on the right.

If there is a change in pitching, draw a horizontal line between the last batter of the old pitcher and the first one of the new pitcher. Also write the new pitcher's name in the box on the bottom.
If a player changes position, draw a vertical dotted line between the innings that it occurred.

Very Recent History.,
Support the Royals no matter what!",How to Be a Kansas City Royals Fan," A baseball cap is also a must. Always wear your Royals outfit to home and road games. You don't have to buy expensive clothing. Even something such as a Royals t-shirt will do.;
, Attend games frequently and become familiar with player stats and positions. Game tickets are usually cheap because, as you may already know, the Royals aren't the best team in baseball. Not even close. If you can't attend a game personally, they are televised on Fox Sports Kansas City and are always covered by WHB on radio.

, Built in 1973, The K is famous for its unique fountains and architecture.

Water Spectacular. The fountains out behind right field. They are the largest privately owned fountains in the world.
Hate the St. Louis Cardinals. They are the Royals' rivals. If you were a fan of both, you'd be a bandwagon or fairweather fan. # Earlier history. The Royals were founded in 1969. After a slow start for their first few seasons, the Royals were one of the best teams in the AL West throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. They made constant playoff appearances until 1985 when they finally won a World Series.

, They have not been in the playoffs since 1985. They remained an above average team from 1986 to about 1994. After that things began to go downhill. The payroll went down and so did the quality of the players they signed. In 1997 the Royals had the chance to move to the National League Central but turned it down. The Royals thought they would do better in the AL. This came back to haunt them. The AL Central is arguably the toughest division in baseball. The NL Central is now the worst. In 2002 they lost over 100 games. In 2003 the losing stopped briefly and the Royals posted their last winning season with what was arguably the most talented Royals team since the early 1990s. In 2004 they were a popular choice to go to the playoffs, but ended with another 100 loss season. In 2005 they lost a club-worst 116 games. 2006 was slightly better with exactly 100 losses.

, The Royals hoped to make a comeback in the 2007 season with players such as Gil Meche and Alex Gordon. Much progress was made in 2007 with 69-93 record. Manager Buddy Bell resigned after the season and was replaced with Trey Hillman of Japan. The 2008 season started well for KC, they sat atop the AL Central standings for a couple weeks and had a decent April. The rest of the year was up and down, as the inconsistent team of young players struggled on offense, but put up average defensive/pitching stats. After a spectacular September that ""saved the year"", the Royals ended up at 75-87, and finishing in 4th place out of the 5 division teams, avoiding the cellar for the first time since 2003. 2009 was a hopeful year for the Royals, they signed talented CF Coco Crisp and power hitter Mike Jacobs. 2009 started with a promising 18-11 start, but then KC quickly fell out of contention, winning less than 30% of their games for the next 2 months. Key players such as Crisp, Gordon, and Jose Guillen were injured much of the year, and others such as Jacobs and most of the bullpen, failed to meet expectations. The Royals overall preformed horribly in '09, but two bright spots were first baseman Billy Butler and pitcher Zack Greinke. Greinke was arguably the best pitcher in baseball, finishing with a 16-11 record and the league's lowest ERA, and he finished second in strikeouts. He is a favorite to win the Cy Young (to be announced in November 2009). Butler emerged as perhaps the only reliable offensive player, hitting .301 with a club high 93 RBIs and 21 home runs.

, The Royals will let you down often, so be prepared. It isn't easy being a Royals fan. The Royals get much criticism from the media. But when they win, and you're there to witness it, it's an awesome feeling.

They were originally referred to as the Devil Rays, and they changed to their current name after the 2007 season.;
, The Rays are a perfect example of a club that wins a lot of games without spending a lot of money, and this is certainly something to be proud of as a Rays fan!

, The Rays are capable of many things, including seemingly impossible comeback victories. Remember that this team won the American League pennant in 2008 after not being on anybody's radar before the season.

, Small market status does mean that the Rays' star players will likely be on the move once they hit free agency (this was the case with Carl Crawford and BJ Upton).

, If you throw your Indians hat on while walking the streets, be prepared to talk Tribe: know the rosters, the standings, the stat. leaders. Don't look like an idiot and be caught off guard, baseball fans can't play it dumb.

, Nothing makes being a fan easier then following the team throughout the season, you'll catch the trades, stats, and scores by simply listening. If you prefer radio, tune to WTAM 1100. If you like TV you'll want the STO network. If you don't live in the Great Lakes region get yourself an XM.

, Nothing will bring your family closer together and closer to the Tribe then taking them to Progressive Field (formerly Jacob's Field), it's a family friendly venue, but with a blue collar touch.

,
The Jake - Jacob's Field, ""Magic at the corner of Carnegie and Ontario"" is the beautiful home of the Tribe. Though the name was recently changed to Progressive Field, many fans still refer to it as Jacob's Field, and you will still be understood if you say ""The Jake."" For now, at least.
Chief Wahoo - You know that racially incorrect red-faced native with the goofy smile on your hat? His name is Chief Wahoo, and he's been in the family for over 50 years.
Bob Feller/Herb Score - Not only were these guys dominating pitchers for the Tribe, but they're kind of like the team and fan's adoptive grandpas. They can be seen at games, and have been loyal to the city since their playing days.
Slider - He's... She's... It's that pink thing that dances on the dugouts between innings.
Hammy - AKA Tom Hamilton, Radio voice for the Tribe, best known for, ""SWING AND A DRIVE, WAAAAAAAY BACK, GONE!!!""
Paul Hoynes - This guy has been trying to answer Tribe fan's questions for years with the Plain Dealer, no one thinks he knows what he's talking about. Hey Hoynes! No offense, we love you anyway.
Terry Pluto and Bud Shaw - These Tribe beat writers are about as opposite as you can get, if these guys were movies, Pluto would be Field of Dreams, and Shaw would be Bull Durham. Pluto writes for a hopeful future, and a past of curses and magic moments. Shaw writes with about as much sunshine in his heart as a winter in Cleveland. Both get the facts straight, Both are knowledgeable, pick one from the other based on your personal taste.
John Adams - You know that pounding you hear during Tribe at bats, or with two strikes on the batter? It all starts in the bleachers with John and his drum. He's been pounding away in the bleacher seats at every game since 1973.

, Get yourself a hat, shirt, wall pennant, and bumper sticker.

Play the ""quarters"" game.",How to Enjoy a Baseball Game when You Don't Like Baseball," It's assumed that you're going to this game with friends or family (you probably wouldn't bring yourself alone or with strangers to a game that you're not interested in), so enjoy the time you're spending with them. In addition, take yourself out of the equation momentarily and enjoy the fact that you're making them happy by going to the game with them. That's the finest gift you can give another person who loves or cares about you.;
, Modern ballparks, especially in the Major Leagues, often have plenty of diversions. Some of the things you can try include:


is seen at New York's Citi Field. ]]Many ballparks have team history museums which can provide you with the opportunity to learn a bit about their club's past. This can turn out to be so interesting and instructive that you might even warm to the game considerably more!
If you came to the ballpark with a bit of extra money on you, explore the shopping options. There are surely some team T-shirts, pennants, or game programs that will serve as a reminder of the experience, even if you just buy them as gifts to say thanks to those who brought you along. Major League clubs will have an even greater variety of stores to explore, with a wide selection of team-branded apparel and other knickknacks to purchase.

, Even the lowest-level Minor League clubs have concession stands, and as the level in question gets higher, the food and drink choices deviate more so from the standard hot dogs, beer, peanuts, and Cracker Jack. Nowadays, it's not unusual for a stadium to offer things ranging from chicken wings to wine (and everything in between). Nowadays, eating at a ballpark can be quite enjoyable!

, Save for a few exceptions you're outside on a nice day (or evening). It's a much better option than sitting home in bed, so enjoy the feeling of being among an electric crowd in an outdoor environment.


Take the chance to talk to some baseball fans. If you're curious and don't mind striking up conversations with strangers, you can learn a lot by talking to fans attending the game. Ask them why they like baseball, what they like about their favorite team, what the game on this day means to them, etc. Ask the also how they would convince someone who isn't that keen on baseball to watch a game – the answers are bound to be very interesting!

, Baseball is a sport. Sporting events are inherently exciting: who will win, who will lose? So even if you're not that thrilled about baseball, see the competitive aspect and go with the flow, and try to get interested in the things that could make or break the game.


If you don't understand the sport, this can be a roadblock to feeling the true excitement of it. Save your companions the potential for game-time headaches by getting your questions answered before the first pitch.
Take along a small guide on baseball. You can check this when things happened and you're feeling totally perplexed.

, If necessary, do what the crowd does, so that you manage to make appropriate reactions to plays. Don't be the guy or girl who sits silently morose while the rest of the crowd is cheering or booing. Get into the spirit of things!


To prevent awkward situations in games where you know the crowd might be split in their allegiances (such as two teams from the same city playing against each other), watch for the reactions of the people in your group. At least showing solidarity with those who took you along to the game will be a nice gesture for the fact that they cared enough to ask you.

, Bring a couple of rolls of quarters. Divide them evenly amongst your group. Rules: Everyone puts a quarter in a cup. One person starts the game by holding the cup. If the batter (no matter which side) reaches first base by any method, even fielders choice, hit by a pitch, walk, etc., the person holding the cup gets the quarters. Everyone puts another quarter in and the cup is passed to the next person. If the batter is ""out"", only the person holding the cup puts a quarter in and the cup is passed to the next person. This game is guaranteed to keep even the most disinterested fan involved while not detracting from the enjoyment of the diehards.

Choose a common A and B.",How to Train for Parkour," Nothing else will train you to really move and push your body through the environment than working with it from the get-go. Do the following routine 2 times each workout session. If you can't do it all, do what you can. Aim for improvement above all else. If you can do it all, consistently increase your number of reps and/or sessions bit by bit. Remember to take a day or two off every week to give your muscles time to rebuild. 10 squats (building up to plyometric box jumps)
10 push-ups
10 leg lifts on your back with both legs
10 pull-ups;
, You should run at least 7-10 miles (11-16 km) per week. Running is a big part of parkour, and you should be able to run long distances, as well as sprint fast.


Other cardio exercises that are helpful to do are lacrosse, boxing and swimming. Yoga will tone up your muscles, too., Strength is another important aspect of parkour. You can't just hang on the wall; you have to somehow climb over it. Work with the routine described above and combine with weight training for optimal results.


Do not become obsessed with how much weight you can lift. Perfect form and endurance (number of reps) are much more important. After all, you'll be working with the weight of your body, not lifting cars.

, Parkour can be a dangerous sport if you are not conditioned, so be sure to stretch properly beforehand. If you do not warm up before you stretch, you could lose up to 30% of your muscle's possible strength and power. What's more, make sure you stretch to prevent injury or strain.


Don't miss any part of your body. Parkour may seem like it uses mostly legs, but your arms, neck, back, and shoulders are equally important. If you have an injury, you should not be stretching without a physical therapist (or doing parkour in the first place).

, The high carb vegan diet is the most efficient, and non calorie restrictive diet, that will provide the highest energy levels for intense sports like parkour. Raw till 4 is the most popular high carb, low fat vegan diet, and one of the best. Whole and unprocessed foods are best for parkour athletes (traceurs). Your main source of calories should come from fruits. That might sound crazy to a society that has been taught that fruits and veggies are just snacks, but it's true. Eat a lot of high calorie fruits, along with vegetables, and greens. Cooked carbs such as rice, potatoes, and gluten free pasta are perfect for dinner. Animal products such as eggs, dairy, and meats, are actually toxic for our bodies. Don't worry about protein, or any other nutrients. A non-junk food vegan diet is rich in nutritional value. Drink plenty of water--at least 64 ounces per day. Many traceurs consume at least one gallon daily.


Cut out the high-fat, high-sodium processed goods. A healthy weight and muscle-to-fat ratio is important for succeeding at this skill. It's much easier to lift up 180 lbs (82 kgs) of stream-lined muscle over that wall than 220 lbs (100 kgs) of not-so-streamlined fat.
You'll be peeing a lot, but it'll be worth it. You will be healthier, and your body will transform into a well oiled machine! Make sure to chug water after each workout session. Parkour can be incredibly hard on your body and your body needs the hydration to stay in top form.

, Your own success at parkour can depend a lot on what shoes you have. Consider getting ones with grip (for climbing); they should be sturdy enough to handle the motions you'll put them through, but also flexible to ensure your feet can bend properly. They should also be light enough so that they don't weigh you down.


Specialist parkour sneakers are starting to appear on the market. They are designed with the grip, support and stability needed for hard impacts as well as traction for a variety of running surfaces. K-Swiss, inov-8 and Vibram Five Fingers are all popular choices.
You will figure out soon enough that you destroy sneakers faster than you can buy them and that it's not worth spending big amounts of money. Buy cheap sneakers; when you destroy them, get a new pair. Grip and durability are not as important as technique, but make sure the sneakers do have some traction, as it will make climbing a bit easier. Make sure that the soles are not too thick to promote bad landing techniques and to gain more feel for the environment.

, Though it may seem initially scary, start out with steps. Jumping up, not down. Find some outside or a set that are wide and open.


Jump from the ground up to one step, then two, then three, etc. You should be relaxed, well-balanced with a relatively upright posture, and land softly on your toes 10 times in a row before you add another step to your jumps the next session or week. Around 5 or 6 steps should be rather difficult.Find a mid-sized rail to work on your two-handed vault. Use your hands to pull your legs up to the side. One knee should seem to go between your arms. Practice staying balanced as you land.

, A great jump becomes a trip to the hospital without the proper landing. Before you extend yourself, get your landings down. Remember in this order: tuck, extend, absorb.


At the top of your jump, bring your knees up to your waist, feet underneath. Extend your legs to a standing position mid-air, and bring your entire body down upon landing. Place your palms in front to help balance and absorb, just in case. Try to land silently (like a ninja).

, This is a pull-up taken to the extreme and will get you over walls, fences, and high obstacles.


Start with a normal pull-up. Then bring the bar to your chest. After that, work on bringing your chest over the bar, adding dips as well. Eventually, bring it into one fluid motion, from underneath the bar to it resting at your pelvis. Propel your knees up and forward to give your body momentum.

, The times you'll need the roll most are when you are surprised and off-balance. Mastering the shoulder roll could get you out of what would be a terribly sticky situation.


Tuck your head and hands in, relax your body, arc your arms and one shoulder forward in a hula hoop shape around your head, and roll your butt over your head.Think of it going from your shoulder diagonally to your hip.

If you're a bit hesitant, start with one knee on the ground. Put your arm on the inside of your leg, holding the foot that's on the ground. This will help you keep form while doing the roll. Propel yourself forward while holding onto your foot.


Once you get the basic of the roll, start from low jumps, moving progressively higher.

, You've seen it in movies and now you're ready to do it yourself. Start with walls that are just barely out of reach; don't go climbing apartment buildings District B13 style just yet.


Get a good run up to a wall, kick off with your foot, and reach as high as you can, grabbing the edge of the wall. Kip at the top to pull yourself up.
As you get better, use corners for two kick-offs, giving you extra height.

, This is for your safety and for the safety of the objects you are running on and gallivanting over. A structure may seem sturdy and able to withstand your weight, but you won't know for sure until you're climbing on it. Tread lightly to respect yourself and your environment.


Less noise generally means less impact. That's great for the concrete, yes, but the least impact possible is what's best for your knees. Listen to yourself as you move. Or you'll be able to feel it afterward.

, When you start working with a teacher or other trainees, you'll notice that everyone has a different way of going about from point A to point B. None of these is incorrect. All you have to do is find what comes most naturally to you.


Watch videos and observe others, but only to a point. If you're hurting yourself, definitely question your form--but if it's working for you, don't make efforts to change your habits. What comes natural to you may not come naturally to someone else.

, Working with a professional one-on-one is a privilege that no amount of practice can equal. Working with others allows for personal exploration and critiques of your skills that may come in handy for improvement.


If no academy is in your area, hit up your local gyms. A professional will not only teach you everything you need to know, providing you well-rounded skills, they will also make sure you stay safe.
If you do choose to train with others, keep it to a few people. If too many gather, it becomes a roadshow of boasting and showing off skills. The practice should be a collaboration, not one person demanding the others follow suit.

, This is good advice whether you're working by yourself or anyone else. Always establish a starting point and an ending point. There can be innumerable ways there, but only one beginning and end.


The aim is to get there as quickly as possible, not how many impressive jumps you can do or how many walls you can climb up or roll underneath. Pick a path that doesn't stand out in its simplicity or its grandeur.

, Use the momentum you get from shifting your center of gravity back to explode straight upward.


While you are pulling up with your arms, push your feet into the pedals, applying an even amount of pressure to each one., Once you've gotten the bike as high as you can by just leaning back, pull it up with your arms until the bike is standing up, and you're standing up with it.









Keep your pedals level through the whole maneuver.

, You haven't mastered the front pull until you can place the front tire down with carefully controlled motion, rather than just let it snap back to the ground.








, Do this quickly, but not so quickly that you ""throw"" yourself forward and shake the bike.

, Pull them up so that your feet are almost vertical., Your feet will make a scooping motion backward. The pressure you apply to the pedals, with your feet in a horizontal position, will keep your feet on the bike as you pull the back end up with your leg muscles.

, Shrug your shoulders and then push or roll the handlebars forward as you do this.







, Just like with the front pull, you haven’t perfected the back hop until you can delicately place the back wheel down, rather than drop it sharply to the ground.








, As you’re doing this, shove your mass into the ground through the back wheel. This will give the rear wheel a bit of ""bounce"" to help you take off when you move into the back hop.









Pull the front wheel up to maximum height before transitioning to the next part of the maneuver.

, Once you’re front wheel is in the air, snap your heels upward so that your feet are almost vertical.








, Point your toes and then push back with your feet, “scooping” backward. Use the push/pull motion to get the back wheel up (while the front is still in the air).









The pressure you apply to the pedals, with your feet in a horizontal position, will keep your feet on the bike as you pull the back end up with your leg muscles.

,









Try to stay focused on technique rather than worrying about the speed you’re traveling as you bunny hop.

, Squeeze your legs together while you are in mid-air to get a more defined looking bunny hop. Remembering to level the bike is an important habit to establish for when you eventually start bunny hopping onto higher surfaces.








, It stabilizes your landing and makes controlling the bike easier immediately after landing. Only land with your front wheel first when you need to regain front wheel control and traction immediately, such as when you need to make a turn immediately after the hop.









Practice this in grass before you try it on pavement or out on the trail.
If you feel like you are about to start falling during a bunny hop, try to fall uphill and onto grass for a softer landing., Bunny hopping is a bike trick, but it’s also a very useful maneuver when it comes to avoiding or jumping over obstacles in your path when you’re on a ride.









Set up obstacles to practice bunny hopping over, starting at a height of about 6 inches and increasing the height as you get comfortable with each hop.

, This is an additional technique that involves jumping, just like you would on the ground, except during this you are one with your pedals.









Simply jump while twisting forward on the handlebars of the bike, but don't let your feet come off the pedals.
If you keep your feet on the pedals and jump, the back end will come up.
Then bring up the front end at the same time as the tires. You will be pulling up without pedaling.

Without increasing speed, keep constant pressure on the pedals.,
Also when you feel the need to go backwards, pull in the back brakes slightly.,
Do not press the front brake when landing, or you could fall forward.

;
, This allows you to go slower during your wheelie and maintain the wheelie longer, because it's a lot harder to ride a wheelie when you start out fast.








,,,, If you do it well, you will find yourself riding on the back wheel. When your center of gravity is over the rear wheel, you will reach the point where you can balance. Maintain that angle.








, You will sense when your center of gravity shifts. Adjust pedal pressure accordingly. If your center of gravity goes too far, you will tip over backwards. When you sense this, decrease your pedal pressure.








, If you do end up going backwards and you can't save the wheelie, make sure you jump off the back of your bike so you don't fall on your Gluteus Maximus. Run with your bike until you can get back on.

The advantage of stationary bikes is that you can do other things while you ride, like watch your favorite TV show.Regular bikes, however, get you outdoors and can have a positive impact on the environment if they replace transport by car.Of course, you can always do both.


If you choose a regular bike, be aware that there are many different bike styles, from mountain bikes to road bikes to beach cruisers to fixed gear bikes. Bikes can vary widely in price. The type of bike you choose will depend on your body type and on where you plan on riding. Talk to your local dealer, and consider arranging a bike fitting.If you choose a stationary bike, you’ll either need to buy one or join a gym. You’ll also need to decide between a recumbent or an upright bike. Choose the former if you have back problems; choose the latter if you don’t. Upright bikes also help strengthen your core.;
, According to Cornell University weight-loss researcher Brian Wansink, wearing fitted clothes made of lycra instead of baggier outfits makes it easier to keep track of your weight loss. Wansink found that prisoners tend to gain weight because of the baggy jumpsuits they’re forced to wear.Loose-fitting clothes will also create drag and slow you down.
Choose clothes that make more visible to motorists.Over-dressing to sweat more (a common practice in France) won’t actually help you lose weight., A helmet is a must-have if you plan on taking your bike on the road. Make sure you buy one that fits you properly.You’ll also want to bring along a patch kit to repair busted tires and a small hand pump to inflate them.If you plan on storing your bike outside, get a bike lock.It’s also a good idea to carry a saddlebag to store your ID, your keys, and your phone, which might fall out of your pockets as you ride.Carrying a water bottle means that you can stay hydrated while you ride.Consider carrying carbon dioxide cylinders in your pack to quickly re-inflate flat tires.

, Start out nice and easy in a safe location like your neighborhood before tackling more difficult terrain like hills. Once you get more comfortable, you can begin biking in more high-traffic areas.Stick to flat areas at the beginning. Try a local park or bike trail, or find a route using a website like traillink.com.
When you first start biking, you may not be able to travel more than a few miles. Stay close to home so that you don’t get stranded. You should be able to bike a few miles within a month or so., Sprinting with high resistance will burn more calories. Riding at a more leisurely pace with low resistance will help build endurance. But a combination of the two is actually your best bet. A study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that alternating between sprinting and endurance burns more calories.Ride on hills! Champion cyclist Rebecca Rusch uses standing hill drills (that is, alternating between standing and sitting while pedaling up a hill) to build her endurance.
Ride harder at the very end.Try spin classes at your local gym. Or consider hiring a trainer., Plan on riding hard one day and then doing a more leisurely “recovery ride” or some cross-training the next. You should plan entire days off too.Make sure you’re getting enough sleep and giving yourself breaks between cycling sessions. According to Stacy T. Sims, exercise physiologist at Stanford and founder of Osmo Nutrition, sleep deprivation can lead to false hunger and unnecessary cravings.Consider getting a massage on your day off., Determine your target weight and estimate how long it will take you to reach this goal. Biking for weight loss is a long-term strategy. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see immediate results.


Losing 1 to 2 pounds a week is a sensible, achievable goal.Use an online BMI calculator to help determine your ideal weight.

, While there is some disagreement about whether you should eat breakfast beforeor after biking, eating breakfast nevertheless plays an important role in weightloss.


Many people associate breakfast with cereal and bacon. However, if you want to lose weight, all of your meals should consist of lots of fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruits and veggies are best, but frozen versions are often excellent. Use caution when buying canned fruits and veggies, which can contain added sodium and sugar.For protein, choose lean meats, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts., This might seem odd, but eating while on a longer ride can actually help keep you going on longer rides and can help you avoid overeating after rides.Bars, bananas, and gels are good choices for eating while riding.Plan on eating 200-250 calories per hour., The 30 to 60 minutes after your biking session constitute your body’s “recovery time.” Your body needs nutrients to help repair itself.Carbohydrates alone help restore glycogen levels. But eating a combination of carbohydrates and protein together means you don’t have to eat as many carbs, which can be difficult after a grueling workout.Eating protein also helps to rebuild the muscles that have broken down during your ride.Prep your recovery food before you ride in case you’re too tired to put something together when you finish., Make sure you drink plenty of water before, during, and after biking. Soon after finishing your biking session, refill your water bottle and drink the entire thing.Beware energy drinks, which contain caffeine and other stimulants and can lead to dehydration., Storing your bike out of sight allows for other priorities to get in the way of your biking routine. According to Stanford health psychologist and fitness instructor Kelly McGonigal, having a reminder to exercise will keep you motivated to do so.Store your bike in a place where you will be able to use it., An occasional change of scenery will break up the monotony of riding the same route over and over again, and it will present new physical challenges., You can bike to work or do errands around town on a bike. The average bicycle commuter loses weight without putting forth any extra effort.You’ll also save money on gas and have an easy time finding parking.


If you’re planning to ride your bike to work, bring a change of clothes and consider showering at the office, if that’s possible. Whatever you do, avoid being too sweaty at work.
Plan your route to work carefully to make sure you’re not late for work. Make the trip on a day you’re not working so that you can get comfortable with the routine.

, Having friends you can ride with, whether in a spinning class at the gym or on the open road, means that you can exercise and socialize at the same time."

, Do you want to ride it alone or with a group? Those choosing to ride it alone should create contingency plans for unsafe conditions and check in regularly with someone who is monitoring their well-being. Riding it with a group is usually a better idea. You can either recruit friends or others from your local cycling club, or find an existing event to join. The Fuller Center Bicycle Adventure (http://www.fullercenterbikeadventure.org), for example, organizes an annual 1-week fully-supported group ride.

, There are no mountains on the Trace, but there are some moderate to large hills. If possible, your training should include climbing. You should train with at least the same number of miles in each week as you intend to ride. For example, if you intend to average 65 miles (105 km) per day on the Trace, you should train at least 65 miles (105 km) per week. Those who are younger will find that their bodies can adapt more quickly to the distance than those who are older, so older riders may wish to further increase their training regimine.

, The great thing about joining an event is that most of the preparations you will need are already taken care of by the event organizers. This includes emergency support, places to stay, rest stops, and all food. It also may include a ride back to where you started so that you do need to bike all the way back. Be sure to read all the material that the event sends to you ahead of the trip and to pack and prepare accordingly.

, No matter how difficult it seems on the trail, if you do not stop pedaling, you will eventually reach your destination! Keep on going: you can do it.

On average, you should train at least two hours a day for six days a week if you want to become a professional cyclist. If the weather is too cold to cycle outside, train on a stationary bike in a gym or at home.


Training for pro cycling usually takes up about 4-6 hours a day, though sometimes that might include time spent at the gym doing weights and building strength.;
, Do a 60-minute strength-training workout a couple of times a week to build your muscles, specifically your leg and core muscles. You will generally need to be in great shape, with lots of lean muscle.


Good example exercises include squats, leg curls, and lunges.

, You'll need to eat right in order to maintain your body through the grueling challenges of the sport. Get all of the nutrients your body needs, both at home and during a race, to help your body keep up.


Your diet should be rich in fruits and vegetables, as well as carbs and lean protein.

, Pro cyclists need to be able to chug up a hill even when the end of a race is near and their body is already tired. Work on increasing your power so that you can cope with situations like these.

, Not only will this help you develop the skills and strength that you need to succeed, but it will help you help get your name out there in the community. You'll have the head start you need and friends in all the right places.


You'll have to start young in general though, as the US has rules stipulating age for cyclists in some races. , Join a local cycling club and participate in weekly trainings. This will help motivate you and also give you the opportunity to learn from others. You can find local groups by searching internet forums, checking with your local gym, or looking through your local parks and recreation department.

, The pro cycling life can get very lonely. You'll have intense schedules and very little free time. If you want to maintain a social life, you'll want friends who are right there with you.

, You will feel the need to rise to the challenge, the sense of competition helping to push you harder down the road. , Sometimes you can find a good coach through your cycling club, but you can also look through the classifieds in cycling magazines. A good coach can help you break your own time records, build your endurance and speed, and improve your technique when racing against others. An experienced coach can also give you advice about the best nutrition for endurance sports and advise you on the best equipment.

, Analyze each race to see what you can improve on in terms of technique, equipment or physical stamina. Look at the track and see what challenges you're going to have to face, and what you need in order to deal with them! You can also look at videos of racers that you know you'll be competing against, if you can find them, to see how they handle similar challenges.

, Study professional cyclists to learn how they train and eat, and what their techniques and racing strategies are. You'll notice patterns in terms of how they approach a race and work with other cyclists in their teams. Adopt the techniques that work for you.

, Key biking skills, like descending and cornering, can mean the difference between success and failure. Practice these key skills by taking routes that include these features when you practice. , Make no mistake, you're basically never going to make enough money pro-cycling to support yourself. Pro teams usually pay for equipment and travel but the salary is essentially non-existent. Even the payout for major races is actually pretty low. Basically, either you're Lance Armstrong, or you have a side job. And you'll need a flexible job that can work with your training and race schedule.Teaching is a profession that may lend itself to cycling, since you'll have summers off, which is when most of the season takes place.

, Performing well at local events will help build your technique, confidence, and reputation. If you're entering with other members of your local club, be sure to work with them to dominate the racecourse. Look for local races by searching websites like Active.com or the official cycling website for your country.

, Though professional cyclists train extremely hard (like all other professional sports) the financial rewards associated with winning are much lower than those in professional baseball, football, basketball or ice hockey. As such, sponsorship is an important part of becoming a professional cyclist as the amount of cash available will determine the quality of equipment, coaching, and medical care you will have.


Though sponsors usually don't donate as much cash in the amateur leagues as they do for professional cyclists, having a sponsor can make a difference in covering the costs of equipment, training, and travel. It's difficult to do, but worth trying all the same.

, The more attention you get in amateur contests, the more chance you stand of catching the eye of a scout for a professional team.


At the USA Cycling website, you can research events per state and find which you are qualified to enter.

, If you're very lucky, you may end up cycling in an event where a scout will be searching for new talent. If you catch their eye, take the opportunity. Try out when a scout for a professional team asks you to compete for a professional team.

, Accept an offer to ride for a professional team, should you be lucky enough to get one. Good luck!

Determine how often the bike will be folded and unfolded.,
Measure the space you'll have to store your bike.,
Practice folding and unfolding bikes.,
Compare transport accessories.",How to Choose a Folding Bike1," If you'll have to fold and unfold your bike frequently, you want the process to have as few steps as possible so you can complete the task with little delay.Generally, the more compact a bike folds up, the more complicated the folding process will be.
Look for a bike that balances ease of folding with the size of the completely folded bike in a way that best suits your own needs. For example, if you are an urban commuter who uses public transportation often and bikes to and from work, you need a bike that can be folded and unfolded simply.;
, While you may not know every place you might take your bike in the future, check the storage available for folding bikes with air carriers and public transportation.Most airlines and other forms of transport have this information available on their websites. Check with carriers you plan to frequent, as well as those at any destinations you plan to visit.
When determining whether a given bike will fit in the space you have available, don't forget to take the thickness of any cover you'll use into account.

, You don't want to choose a folding bike with a folding mechanism that takes too long, or is too complicated for you to fold the bike smoothly after a couple of tries.How you're going to use the bike comes into play here. If you're an urban commuter who will be carrying your bike on public transportation a lot, you need a bike that can be folded and unfolded as quickly as possible.
If the steps of the folding process are complicated or confusing, you may want to try a similar bike in a different brand. Ask a knowledgeable associate at a bike shop about brands that specialize in ease of foldability.

, Different brands and bike models may have accessories designed to protect the bike during transport. Some accessories include tripods that allow the bike to stand upright, or protectors to prevent scratches.If you're going to be carrying your bike on public transportation frequently, you'll appreciate a cover as well as rubber stoppers to prevent your bike from getting scratched – either while in transit or through repeated foldings and unfoldings.
Keep in mind that certain types of protective accessories or mechanisms may be required if you are traveling in some countries. Look for information on the website of that country's transportation authority.

Know your sand.,
Choose thick or partially deflated bike tires.,
Stick to a low gear in loose sand.,
Minimize shifting and braking in sand.,
Hold yourself upright.,
Relax.,
Pedal with consistent force.",How to Bike Through Sand," If you're a beginner to sand, consider sticking to wet sand, or to thin layers of sand over hard soil. These conditions are similar to slightly wet grass. Loose sand slows you down considerably, and makes steering less sensitive.


Steep slopes are especially difficult. Stay away from them until you're more comfortable.
If cycling at the beach, stay near the water but out of water range. You'll have more room to maneuver at low tide.;
, The looser the sand, the wider your tires need to be. For best results, get tires at least 1.75 inches (4.5 cm) wide. Loose sand requires even chunkier support. If you only have narrow tires, let a little air out to create a flatter riding surface.


This impairs performance on hard surfaces. If you're riding a trail with mixed conditions, you'll have to compromise.
Your rim diameter limits your tire width options. If you ride over sand often and your bike frame supports it, consider switching to a larger wheel.

, The lower gears produce more torque, reducing the chance that your rear wheel gets stuck in sand. This can feel frustrating in combination with thicker tires, but you need this extra push to stay on the surface.

, These will slow you down and dig your wheels into the sand, killing your rhythm. Plan ahead and shift gears while you're still on solid ground.


You may shift when traveling down a sandy slope, since you'll have enough speed to carry you. Make sure you're in a gear for easy pedaling once you hit flat ground.

, Resist your urge to lean over the front wheel. This will dig it into the sand, slowing you down or disrupting your course. Hold your back straight and centered over the bike.


While riding on dunes, you can even lean back slightly and pull up a little on the handlebars.
Take wider turns and don't lean in as much as you usually would. Your bike doesn't have enough grip to take advantage of the extra weight.

, Loose sand makes for a bumpy, wiggly ride. Keep your body loose to absorb the shock and stay in control.

, Don't pedal in short, uneven bursts, or the change in speed may cause your rear wheel to slip and dig into the sand. Find a cadence that works for you and stick to it until the slope changes.


Ride slower than you normally would, especially as a beginner. It's easy to lose control over sand, and you don't want to go flying over the handlebars.
If you're on hard ground and see a small patch of sand coming up, gathering speed may help you pass through it. Don't forget to take weight off the front wheel as you approach.

, You won't need to do Barspins on a ramp at first.


Don't worry about height of your Bunny Hop either. No need to go that high. Has to be high enough to get the spin done in the air, but doesn't need to be way high. Just get it automatic.
Make sure your Bunny Hop is very stable.

"
Understand your limitations.,
Choose the wheel size that matches your intended use.,
Adapt your bike for a comfortable riding position.",How to Choose a Folding Bike2," Unfortunately, most manufacturers of folding bikes only offer frames in one size. If you are taller than average or shorter than average, you may have trouble finding a folding bike in the best size for you., There are generally five different sizes of folding bike wheels. The size that will work best for you depends mainly on when and where you plan to ride your bike.The larger the wheel size, the larger your bike will be when it's folded, since the bike cannot fold up any smaller than the wheels. If you plan to use public transportation frequently, you probably want a smaller wheel.
Smaller wheels are more difficult to maneuver on uneven surfaces and trails. If you plan on going through longer bike rides through the countryside, you may want to go with larger wheels.

, If you have difficulty finding a bike of the right frame size, you may be able to adjust the bar ends or use a different seat. This can help you find a good riding position, especially on longer rides.Speak to someone in a bicycle repair or specialty shop to assess your options. You may have to experiment with adaptations to find the best fit.

"
"
Set up test rides.,
Review your intended cycling locations.,
Disregard bike weight.,
Measure gear ratios.,
Upgrade your tires.",How to Choose a Folding Bike3," There's no way to properly evaluate the performance of a particular folding bike unless you have the opportunity to go ride it yourself. Try to test ride several different folding bikes so you can compare.Most bike specialty shops and some larger sporting goods stores will arrange test rides for you, but you may have to ask.
Take your test ride on terrain that best matches the terrain where you plan to use the bike the most. For example, if you want to take the bike on a tour of the Southeast Asian countryside, you want to take your test rides on dirt or gravel roads.

, Where you plan to ride your folding bike makes a big difference in which folding bike will work best for you. Consider the type of terrain as well as the average length of your rides.Generally, a bike with larger wheels and more gears will give you better performance on longer, touring rides. However, a bike with smaller wheels and fewer gears is better for urban riding, where you typically will have to stop and start frequently.
Consider maneuverability as well. If you plan to bike in hilly or mountainous areas, you'll want a bike with a more rigid frame so you have more control over it.

, The weight of the frame may normally make a difference with a bicycle's performance. However, in the case of folding bikes the weight of the bike doesn't make that big of a difference in terms of touring performance.If you're going to be carrying your folding bike around a lot, however, you may prefer the lightest frame possible.

, The gear ratio of folding bikes is measured in a unit called ""gear inches."" The number of gear inches you need to get the best performance out of your folding bike depends on where you're going to use it.A low gear of 25 inches is suitable for nearly any type of terrain, whether urban street or country trail.
If you're an urban commuter who will primarily be using your bike in the city, look for a bike with a top gear of around 70 inches.
For the highest performance folding bike, look for one with a top gear of over 100 inches.

, The best tires for your folding bike depend on where you'll typically be riding it. You'll also want to take into consideration other features such as extra puncture protection, regardless of where you'll be riding your bike.For example, if you plan on riding your bike primarily on paved roads, and speed is important to you, a slick tire that would enable greater speed and maneuverability would probably be your best choice.
There are limited types of tires available for most folding bikes. For this reason, the tires available for the bike will become a factor when choosing the bike itself. When you've found a frame you like, make sure you can get the tires you'll need.

Feel the control of the bike as your things hold the seat. That control is how you will be able to barspin.
You may need to adjust your seat height to be a little higher. If it is too low you won't be able to do the seat pinch very well. You can always put it back lower once you get it.
Wear knee pads when you practice the seat pinch. Unless you love bruises all over your knees. Some people do.
Practice riding with no hands, keeping the bike straight by doing the seat pinch. Do that no hands riding on flat ground again.

, The manual spin is just practicing the spin of the handlebars with the bike still.


Hold the bike (or scooter) still by putting the wheels hard against a chain link fence.

Keep your arms slightly bent while riding.,
Keep your leg at a 90 degree angle at the top of the stroke.,
Strengthen your core muscle groups.,

Keep your back limber with stretches.",How to Avoid Lower Back Pain While Cycling," It should be obvious that an improperly-sized bike can lead to back pain or other physical issues, but many people select a new bike based on price point and tend to downplay the importance of the bike's dimensions and ergonomics. Ideally, a bike should be customized to your body, but that can get pretty expensive. A more economically friendly alternative is buying a bike from an actual cycle store (not a big department store) and asking the salesperson about proper sizing.


Once you've narrowed down the style of bike and the size of the frame, ask to take the bike on an extended test drive (at least 30 minutes) and see how your back responds to it.Choosing a bike that is too big will cause you to hunch over too far when reaching for the handlebars, which can eventually lead to back pain.
For those with low back conditions, a reclining bike (also called a recumbent bike) may be the best bet.;
, Although the bike's frame height is important, especially for being able to dismount safely, the height of your saddle is even more paramount. Saddle height is determined by how long your legs are and should be positioned so that when the pedal is at the bottom of the stroke (nearest the ground), your knee should have a slight bend in it — between 15 – 20 degrees of flex ideally.Your hips and buttocks shouldn’t move sideways while peddling and you shouldn’t have to stretch your legs at the bottom of each pedal stroke — stretching too far with your legs puts strain on your low back.
Adjusting the saddle angle is also important. Positioning it horizontal (parallel to the ground) suits most people, although people with chronic back conditions or sensitive perineum areas may feel more comfortable with the saddle tilting somewhat forward.

, The bike's handlebars should be adjusted to a height at which you can comfortably reach them from an upright position, while having your elbows slightly bent. This is usually a personal preference, but the handlebar height is often even with or up to 4 inches (10 cm) below the saddle height, depending on back muscle flexibility.The angle of the handlebars is not adjustable on many low-to-mid-range bikes, but if yours is, try different settings and see how your back responds. Increasing the angle acts to raise the handlebars and bring them closer to your body (allowing you a more upright posture), which may be helpful for preventing back strain.


Novice and occasional cyclists should keep their handlebars at the same height as their saddle.
Seasoned cyclists generally keep their handlebars a few inches below their saddle height to be more aerodynamic and faster, but it requires decent flexibility within the muscles of their backs.

, Almost all modern bikes (at least mountain bikes) have some sort of suspension or shock-absorbing accessories. Shock absorption is very important for the well-being of your spine, especially if you mountain bike on rough terrain and are getting frequently jarred.The smoother your ride is, the less musculoskeletal pain you're likely to develop. Get a bike with front shocks at the very least, but consider bikes with full suspension somewhere underneath the seat if preventing back pain is important to you.


Other forms of shock absorption on a bike include: thick knobby tires, heavily padded saddles and cushioned biking shorts.
Most suspension accessories are adjustable, so ask a qualified salesperson for assistance if you need to.
Road racing bikes tend to be especially light and rigid, but don't come with suspension.

, Your posture while cycling is also crucial if you want to avoid back pain. Try to keep your back straight while cycling — not completely erect like sitting in a chair — but rather flat, stable and well supported by squared shoulders. Distribute some of your weight to your arms and hands while keeping your chest and head up.Shift positions and change the angle of your upper body periodically in order to prevent muscle fatigue.


Gently lifting and lowering your head from time to time is helpful for keeping your neck loose and avoiding muscle strains.
Approximately 45% of overuse injuries to professional road cyclists involve the low back., When riding your bike, keep your arms slightly bent (10 degrees) while gripping the handlebars. This posture will allow the joints and muscles of your upper body to absorb some of the vibrations and impact instead of your spine, particularly if you tend to ride on rough terrain such as forest or mountain paths.Grip the handlebar with your whole hand, but not too tightly. Wear padded cycling gloves to help with shock absorption.
If your back tends to act up while cycling, break your ride into segments and take more rest stops.

, When peddling, it's more efficient and best for your hips and low back to have your knee bend at a 90 degree angle at the top of the peddle stroke (when it's farthest from the ground). At 90 degrees, your thigh should be roughly parallel to the saddle, which then allows for a strong push down on the pedal. At the bottom of the stroke (when the peddle is closest to the ground), your knee should be flexed at about 15-20 degrees, which is unlikely to strain the low back muscles, tendons and/or ligaments.If your legs do not match these angles while you pedal, then adjust the height of your saddle.
The front 1/3 of your foot should be in contact with the pedals while peddling.

, Your core includes the muscles in your pelvis, lower back, hips and abdomen.Having a strong core that works in harmony dramatically reduces the risk of back injuries and pain from exercise. Making sure your core muscle groups are relatively strong before you start cycling is a good strategy to reduce the risk of back pain.


Cycling does not specifically strengthen the core body muscles, although it can certainly strain them.In contrast, any exercise that utilizes the abdominal and back muscles in coordinated fashion is a good core exercise. For example, just trying to maintain your balance while sitting on a large exercise ball will work your core muscles.
Do bridge exercises: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, keeping your spine in a neutral position and not tilting your hips. While contracting your abdominal muscles, raise your hips off the floor and hold the position for at least 30 seconds. Repeat five to 10 times daily. This will also help strengthen your glutes.
Try planks: Start on all fours, with your hands flat on the floor directly beneath your shoulders. Extend your legs behind you so your hands and toes are bearing your body weight. Keep your back straight — don't let is sag or round up — and tighten your stomach. Hold for 30 seconds, then release. Repeat two to three times, gradually increasing the hold time of the exercise.
A great activity that will strengthen your core and prepare you for cycling is swimming.

, Cycling can obviously strengthen your legs, but research has shown that if your legs are not strong enough before getting involved with cycling, then you're at higher risk of back pain.Scientists have demonstrated that when cyclists pedal to exhaustion, their hamstrings and calf muscles become progressively more fatigued, which negatively impact their spinal posture and putting them at risk for back pain. As such, consider increasing the strength in your legs before you embark on cycling as a hobby.


Strengthen you hamstrings by doing deep leg bends, lunges and/or hamstring curls at the gym two to three times weekly. Start with light weights and progress to heavier ones over the course of a few weeks. Consult with a personal trainer if you're unfamiliar with weight training.
Strengthening your calves by grabbing some free weights (at least 10 pounds in each hand) and doing heel raises. While on your tiptoes, hold for five seconds and repeat 10 times on a daily basis. Progress to heavier weights over the course of a few weeks.
In addition to strengthening the legs, one should also strengthen the glutes (buttocks). If the hamstrings and calves become too tight, the glutes become weak. This leads to more work being placed on the lower back. Weak glutes can also contribute to knee pain. Strengthen your buttocks (glutes) by doing a bridging exercise. Lie on your back with feet flat and knees bent. Slowly lift your back off the ground as high as you can so your thighs and back are aligned in a straight line. Hold this position for 20 seconds. Rest and repeat 3 to 4 times. You can increase the hold position as you improve in strength. , The flip side of a strong back is a flexible back. Strong back muscles are important for generating power while peddling and absorbing the micro-trauma of road shock and vibration, but a flexible back is crucial for enduring the posture required of cycling without leading to strains. A great activity that stretches the back and other core muscles is yoga. The challenging body poses of yoga also act to strengthen your core and leg muscles and improve your overall posture.Do leg to chest stretches: lie down on a padded surface with your knees bent and feet together on the floor. Grab your shins and try to touch your thighs to your chest. Go as far as you can until you feel a stretch in your low back muscles and hold (without bouncing) for 30 seconds. Repeat 10x daily until you have no more back discomfort from cycling.
As a beginner, yoga poses might create some soreness in the muscles of your legs and back — it should fade away in a few days.

Pass on the left or wait behind: Cars are required to move into the part of the bike lane bordered by a dashed line before making a right turn. That way the car will not cut off cyclists. When a car in front of you in traffic signals a right turn, and you are continuing straight ahead on your bicycle, pass on the left side of the right-turning car or wait behind it until it has made the right turn.
Evasive action - turn the corner quickly: If a car makes a sudden right turn in front of you, you’ll need to take evasive action. The best move in this situation is to turn quickly around the corner with the car. Turning a corner at high speed takes a bit of practice. While riding straight ahead, turn your handlebars very slightly away from direction you want to turn. This shifts the bike slightly from under you, preparing for a sharp turn. You can then turn hard in the direction you wish to turn.;
,


Ride 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) away from parked cars: A bike lane is often directly alongside parked cars. It is important to leave enough space to avoid being hit by car doors opening. When there is no bike lane, you may need to ride near the center of the car lane. Remember that a bicyclist is allowed full use of the lane to stay safe when the lane is narrow. A bicyclist may also take the lane when traveling the same speed as traffic.
Evasive action - Stop quickly: If you find yourself about to be “doored,” you will need to stop as fast as possible. To do so, sit far back and low on your seat with your weight over your rear wheel and brake with even pressure on both brakes. Sliding your weight back on your seat gives your rear tire more traction. You will be able to stop more quickly, with less skidding. If most of your weight is over your front wheel when you try to stop, you risk going over the handlebars.

, MUNI streetcar tracks present a special hazard for City cyclists, and are a common cause of falls. If your wheel slips into the track, it will cause you to lose control of your bicycle and fall. The best way to avoid this is to cross MUNI streetcar tracks at a nearly perpendicular angle. This minimizes the risk that your bike wheels will get caught. Foggy or rainy weather increases the risk, because the tracks are more slippery when wet.

,


Check over your left shoulder for traffic before you move out of the bike lane or go through an intersection. By checking over your left shoulder, you can see cars coming from behind you. It’s important to practice this so you can do it without swerving. Drill yourself in riding straight ahead and looking over your shoulder for traffic, until you can do it easily.
Beware at Market and Octavia: There have been more injury collisions at Market and Octavia than any other intersection in the City. Drivers make an illegal right turn there to get to the freeway. This is extremely dangerous for cyclists. Watch out for cars making illegal right turns across the bike lane at this intersection.

, Leave enough room behind a truck or bus so the driver can see you in the rearview mirror. Remember that the driver can’t see you if you are too close behind or beside the vehicle. Try to make eye contact with the driver via their rearview mirror. Do not try to sneak by at bus zones - always pass on the left. When passing, stay several feet away from the sides and wheels of the vehicle. Be extra cautious of trucks and buses turning right since they often first pull straight forward and thereby give the illusion that they are proceeding straight and then trap the unwitting cyclist as they make their turn.

, Riding against the direction of traffic can lead to a collision. Drivers habitually look in the direction of the flow of traffic when entering a roadway or changing lanes. A driver will not be looking out for traffic coming from the wrong direction. A bicyclist popping up from the wrong direction risks a collision. Ride predictably, with traffic, to stay safe.

, You are required by law to have a white front light, as well as reflectors on your pedals, wheels, and on the back of your bike when riding at night. It is also advisable to have a blinking light on the back of your bike. The more lights, the better. Do not wear dark colors for nighttime riding. Wear light colors and reflective clothing or backpacks. Also, take into account the lower visibility and ride more slowly at night, to allow yourself and motorists enough time to react.

, Slow down in rain or fog! Also, use lights and reflectors to increase your visibility. It will take you longer to stop in wet weather, because water between your brake pad and wheel rim keeps the pads from gripping. The wetness can also cause you to skid. Brake more gradually, and start braking sooner, than you usually would. To test your brakes, pump them a few times. That will also reduce the moisture layer somewhat to get your brakes working better.

, In urban riding, you will encounter broken glass, rocks, and other debris, and road defects such as potholes or uneven pavement. It’s important to learn to steer quickly around these hazards. To do this, practice a slight side-to-side movement of your handlebars – steer quickly to one direction, then the other. That way, your tires will avoid the debris without you being thrown out of your line of travel. If you find you are unavoidably running over a rock or other debris, stand slightly on your pedals, with your weight off your seat, to decrease the risk of a flat tire. The slower you ride, the more likely such hazards will not result in injury.

, If you have a collision or fall, a helmet can prevent brain injuries. Your helmet should be properly fitted, with the straps adjusted to keep it positioned securely. In addition to traditional bike helmet designs, there are now many commuter helmet designs available. These often provide more protection, covering more of the head with a tougher shell. They also come in a variety of stylish looks, from matte black to leopard print.

, Bunny hop, and spin the handlebar.


Keep your eyes on the handlebars. Do not look at the ground.
Don't be pedaling fast. With a fixie you can do a barspin easier if you are hopping barely moving at all.

Gather the materials in ""Things You'll Need"" found below.,
Before the game starts, give each player x number of shuriken they can hold.,
Use the Element of Substitution.,
If you are able to catch a launched shuriken, you are not out and can use the shuriken.,
Know that a shuriken on the floor may or may not be picked up off the floor, based on the game style: SHURIKEN RETRIEVAL or NO SHURIKEN RETRIEVAL.,
No human contact is permitted.

",How to Play the Shuriken Game,";
, When the game starts, each player can throw shuriken at their opponent in order to ""hit them out""(similar to dodge ball), in an open area. Players must stay in the boundaries of established ""open area"" for the duration of the game, as they are free to move in it.


First player to get hit by a moving(thrown) shuriken loses. By throwing your shuriken, if a launched shuriken connects with your opponent's body then lands elsewhere, you win.







, This is a special move which allows a player to trump a hit. However it requires the player to see ahead and ""costs"" 2 shuriken. To do this move, you must have at least 2 shuriken in your hand, both ready to drop on the ground. For instance, a player sees they are about to get hit by a shuriken. Taking one shuriken, they drop it on the ground, BEFORE getting hit. Then, the player is hit by the shuriken. Finally, the player drops another shuriken on ground, thereby successfully accomplishing a ""substitution"".


Note: the pattern must follow ""drop-hit(s)-drop"" and flow consecutively, otherwise, it is considered a fail substitution(and that player loses). For a legal substitution, the first shuriken can only be dropped immediately after the shuriken you believe, will hit you, was launched. A player finishing a substitution must drop the last shuriken within a second after getting hit, otherwise it's also a fail substitution.






The element of substitution voids shuriken hits in-between the first dropped shuriken and the second dropped shuriken. So, it is possible to get hit by more than 1 shuriken during a substitution and still be in the game.(For example, you drop a shuriken, then you are hit by one. Not even a second later, you are hit by another. You see that this would be the last in the ""chain"" of shuriken in the current situation, so you drop a shuriken within a second after the 2nd shuriken that hit you.) In addition, it is perfectly legal to be moving during a substitution, as long as the dropping portion is not interfered.







, The definition of ""catching"" means any 2 body parts of a player quickly come together so that the shuriken is lodged in between and stopped from its path of motion. Catching shuriken with your hands is just as legal as catching one between your knees or just as a shuriken touches your body, you slap the shuriken against your body so that it stops. All this is considered catching and you are not out. However, the shuriken cannot fall out of its lodged position for at least a second, thereby proving you have ""caught"" it. There are not ""hot potato"" catches allowed nor second catches(meaning you catch it, it falls, then catch it again). The shuriken must come at you, then stop when it connects to your body.

, If not permitted, shuriken from the hand is exhausted via throwing and stays on the ground for the duration of the game. Note the number of shuriken in the ""starting hand"" should be more. If permitted, players may pick up shuriken off the ground and into their hands. Once a shuriken leaves contact with the ground, it is considered ""in the hand"", thereby legal for substitution, for instance.

, Most indoor arenas are in a low-light environment. Wear dark colored clothing, minimizing bright logos or things that will stand out in the darkness. Remember, black-lights will make whites and other light colors glow. Wear all black; it helps blend in and hide!

, Each facility operates under different conditions and equipment. They also calculate scoring differently. With some scoring methods, you gain more points for hitting someone else than you lose for getting hit, so it's better to use an offensive strategy, over a defensive one.

, Get a feel for how firmly you need to pull the trigger and how you can hold it comfortably. Test your laser for drift. Do this by firing at a wall and moving your laser backwards. if the dot moves significantly, you will need to compensate for the ""crooked sight"" since most equipment tags with an invisible laser that fires perfectly straight.

, Once suited up, try to get into the arena as early as possible to adjust to the low light. If you have a chance to shoot your enemies right away as they enter the arena, take it.

, In the arena, find yourself a good position to start off with. Something covered or protected, not out in the open. Avoid clustering around others if possible (some arena require you to start at a base or station).


If you do start at a base or station, don't be the first or the last to leave. Leaving first poses the risk of not knowing where the enemy is. By leaving last, the enemy may have found your base or the good spots may have been taken.

, Depending on how the laser tag venue handles scoring, it may be better to play an offensive strategy; in other words, it's worth risking getting hit if you can hit multiple enemies. However, you can still be smart about how you defend yourself. By starting out hidden you can get a feel for the other players. Look for somewhere you can protect yourself from the enemy while still see what is going on and fire on them.


Look for positions that cover your back and give you a view over some area - preferably not very wide, but deep.

, Most laser uniforms have lights on them somewhere. When you see the lights coming toward you, quickly aim and start shooting! You will take the person by surprise!

, These vary from outfit to outfit but may include the gun, chest, waist, earpiece. Larger zones are your better bet.


Depending on the gun design, you may find it helpful to make sweeping motions across the enemy's chest area as you fire repeatedly. This can increase your chance of triggering one of their several chest sensors, compared to aiming directly just at one.

, Don't be afraid to shoot. If you can hit an enemy, it's generally worth risking getting hit, particularly in a team game. If you see a group of enemy team members all gathered together, take them down. They might hit you, but if you're quick and have good aim, you can hit at least one enemy, if not more, before you get hit. A 1-to-1 hit ratio is not a bad outcome necessarily, and if you can beat that, you'll be earning points.

, Don't just stand there; use the time when your sensors are deactivated to get out of the way. If you need to recharge your gun, head there immediately. Tell any teammate where the enemy is to return fire. Good communication is key to a team victory!


If the same enemy repeats attacking you (spawn killing), get a group of your team to take them down, or see a referee if they are violating the rules.

, If you aren't, then you can snipe at the other team without taking to many hits. If you find a good location and can take out several enemies while they're attacking one another, that's ideal. Consider corner spots where you can cover any back sensors with the wall.

, Example: Tell one group to give you covering fire while another group flanks them.


You can try to ambush enemies if you got a good amount of teammates and you take them by surprise. However, it requires a lot of skill and experience.

, After the game, review your score and talk with your teammates to see what you can improve on. A debriefing can be very helpful for improvement.

If you already own a bike, it might be suitable if it's in top condition and has plenty of life left in it. If you're not sure, it's probably better to purchase a new bike specifically for the purpose of your across-country trip. Another approach is to ride your old bike into the ground, being prepared to purchase a new one along the way. The downside is that you need to know where it is possible to purchase the exact bike you want, you need to be near such places when your old one gives up. You may find that you're not happy with the new one because it hasn't been broken in through test riding.


Your bike frame should be chosen with your intended gear in mind. If you are touring on your credit card, staying in motels etc, a light frame will do you well. If you are camping, however, the extra pounds of a sturdy steel frame ""Touring Bike"" will not be a significant portion of your over all load.
If you have to rely on your existing bike, have it fully checked out by a professional by bringing it to a bike shop. Replace any parts that are showing some form of wear and tear.;
, You need to prepare yourself both physically and mentally. Realize that you will need determination, grit and an ability to endure hardships such as horrible weather, wet and muddy clothing, occasional falls, exhaustion and challenges in finding accommodation at times. Weather, food, shelter, level of fitness and availability of finances can all take their toll on your mental well-being when constantly riding. If you have taken good care of the logistics, you'll experience less stress.


To prepare physically, you will need to get fit. Start by riding short distances at least six days a week. Run on a treadmill and lose weight. Every pound on your body you will have to drag along with you, so get rid of most of it (some of it will fall off as you're riding, so don't be too radical in your weight loss). Read How to train for BMX racing for some tips on how to train for long distances. You should practice riding long distances and do plenty of hill climbs––ride to and from work, studies, activities, etc., every opportunity you get, all weather.
As you near the time of your departure, be certain to get in some long practice rides while fully loaded with your gear (or equivalent weight in the panniers) to help you work out the packing details.
Use affirmations or positive statements to ready yourself for the big trip ahead. Look at a map of your country and say to yourself, ""I can do this!"". A lot of what you'll go through will be about willpower and the determination to keep going even when you're aching and want to stop. Using visualization and positive imagery of achievements, as sportspeople use, will be one way of helping you stay on track.

, Map out what route you're going to take, as well as any detours of interest. It's also a good idea to know of detours for the sake of safety––if a road or track gets closed due to a landslide or accident, what alternative routes are available to you? You need to start thinking like this from the outset. Google streetview is a terrific way to get a picture of the shoulder width, landmarks so you don't miss your turn, and even a very rough estimate of traffic. There are lots of other things to consider, such as:


Are you going to undertake this journey alone as a self-supported tour, or will you join up with a group or team on an organized tour? Self-led journeys offer tremendous freedom and solitude, while organized tours offer increased safety, organization and planning that allow the riders to focus more on the ride and less on logistics. The best ones also offer a strong sense of community and companionship on the road.
Are you going to ride in all the roads or take some backstreets? Check your bike laws to see if you can ride on motorways/freeways and streets, major roads/highways, etc. Many larger roads make cycling illegal, so be aware well in advance. The best routes will have low traffic levels and are paved. While gravel or dirt roads are doable, they're best kept to a minimum. When planning your route, also aim to avoid any stretch of road or track that goes for more than 30 miles/50 kilometers without facilities. If you do need to travel such a long distance, ensure that you have extra water, food, and ways to signal distress to any biking partner or passersby.
Know how long it will take to get to a destination and be reasonable in your assessment. First time long distance riders will find the exertion very difficult at first, so plan for less riding at the beginning and plenty of enjoyable sightseeing rest stops.
Will you ride alone or with a riding companion? It's a lonely and less safe journey when done alone, although this is the preferred approach by some. A riding companion can be a source of motivation, companionship, entertainment and shared loads and funds, so it's recommended to travel with at least one other person.
Check out sleeping options well in advance. Are you happy to set up your bivouac just anywhere or would you prefer accommodation options with a bed and prepared meal each night? The choices are going to be influenced by budget, place, personal preference and availability of options. Some places will require advance bookings, even campgrounds, so spend time researching this with care. In many cases, you'll need to call ahead to reserve a place for your tent or for a room, so take this into account. And don't neglect friends, family and other free offers of comfortable accommodation along the way!
Decide which hours of the day you'll do cycling and when you'll stop. Be clear on the time you're going to leave your camp/accommodation each day and what time you should arrive at your destination. Use common sense––if you're leaving home at 9pm, even in summer it's going to be dark/getting dark in most places. You will therefore need to keep your lights on until the morning. If you're leaving at 9am, you probably won't need your lights turned on yet unless it's winter or a very dull day. Always question the need to ride at night though––it's much safer to stick to daylight hours.
Choose the season wisely. Cycling when it's snowing or at the hottest time of the year is never advisable. While it is possible to cycle in either extreme, it's not prudent and you'll barely enjoy the experience, thereby undermining the point of the journey. If you don't know how the seasonal changes affect different regions of your country or the one you're going to, do some research online or in guidebooks like the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide. And don't forget wind direction! It's always much easier to pedal with the wind, not against it, so get hold of information on the usual seasonal wind patterns for the places you're headed; these patterns will vary by region and season.
Take elevation into account. Flat ground all the way will probably cause few problems but few countries in the world offer that experience the entire way! Hill climbs are hard work and will require more energy expenditure from you. You'll need to account for this when you're planning distance expectations and routes––sometimes you may want to avoid too many hill climbs if it's at all possible.
Coming home. Are you going to do a circuit and ride back home or are you going to ride coast to coast and catch a flight or train back? Time constraints and a desire to get back home will affect your decision here.

, If you're riding to raise money for charity or to raise awareness of an issue, posting an advert in the newspaper (and perhaps through online places such as Facebook) will mean that more people know about you and the cause you're riding for, meaning that more people are likely to donate, offer accommodation assistance or other forms of in-kind support. While this step is not necessary, it's still a good idea. If you're not riding for a charity, you can still give out your email address for some support. If you want to keep your journey to yourself, which is understandable, you don't have to advertise. You could always just tell a few friends to help you out, you don't always need (or want) the whole country knowing.

, Check what you need to have fitted on the bike (and on your clothing where relevant). Bike laws will explain how many lights and reflectors you will need, as well as any other essential requirements. Make sure your bike is 100 percent legal––you don't want to be fined £300 at the other end of the country, do you? Basically, a legal bike is a safe bike (that's the reason for the laws, not to be a nuisance to you) and you want the most safety you can get when making a journey like this one.


Make sure your bike's tyres are rock solid. If they're not, pump them up. You want the tyres to last at least a few miles before you have to pump them up again. Remember, bicycle tires often require 90 PSI to operate safely. Automotive tire ranges do not apply to bicycles. If you are in doubt, check the bicycle's owner's manual.
Tighten up the handlebars and seat so that you won’t fall off your bike. The same rule applies; they should be tight for a few miles before they need to be re-tightened. In fact, they should actually be able to make the full journey with only one tighten. Don't worry if they can't, it's no big deal––take along the necessary tools though.
Replace your helmet if it's recently suffered a hard knock. Helmets can and have saved lives, so you want yours to be fully safe. When in doubt, replace it. When not in doubt, replace it anyway. Even if you have to spend £50 on a helmet, it's better than losing your life.
Clean the bike's lights and reflectors, replace their batteries and pick up some spares just in case. Shine a torch on the reflectors to test them out. Check different angles too.

, You'll need to pack a set of panniers/saddlebags (2 or 4) to bring with you to distribute the weight evenly. What exactly do you put in the storage bags? In your bags you will need:

. Do not use a backpack. While great for hiking, backpacks put the center of gravity too high up on a cyclist and unnecessarily increase stress on the back and shoulders. Get bike racks and appropriate panniers/saddle bags.

Food. Tinned food is often the best as it doesn't go bad. You could bring freshly made sandwiches/wraps packed in a cooler container to keep them fresh when it's hot. Some energy bars, fruit, nuts and seeds are good high energy options too. And always bring money for some food purchased along the way. If it's a good season, roadside foraging for berries, etc. might be possible but only if you know it's safe to eat (non-poisonous and no sprays) and be careful not to go around pinching food from farms. Many farms will have cheaply available food for sale at their door, so be sure to check. By the way, you can never have too much food––you'll be needing a lot of energy.
Drinks. Never forget the importance of hydration. Initially you'll probably need to carry a lot of water because you won't know how much you'll want until a routine is established. Never underestimate the water––carrying more is wise. Eventually you'll get a good idea of how much is enough for your needs, although having spare water continues to be a wise plan. Some riders prefer energy drinks such as PowerAde or Lucozade, because these replace lost electrolytes. You might like to experiment. If you know you can refill with fresh water regularly, you might get away with carrying less but if not, carry at least eight bottles of drink distributed in the panniers, your backpack and on the bike itself (you can buy drink bottle holders for bikes). This may seem slightly extreme but it's necessary until you know your needs better.

Avoid fizzy drinks, energy drinks like Red Bull and alcohol. Fizzy drinks and energy drinks will give you a temporary buzz, but after the buzz comes the crash. This means you will be completely drained of energy. Alcohol will affect your sense of balance. Drinking and riding is as illegal, not to mention dangerous, as drinking and driving. Never do either of these two things.


Maps, compass/GPS tool. Knowing where you're going is crucial!
Spare lights. In case one of the bike's lights decides not to work or suddenly breaks, bring at least three spares of both types, back lights and front lights. On your bike you should have one back light, one front light and one light clipped on to your backpack. If you do the math, you will see that you need nine spare lights. If the lights on your backpack and the lights on your bike are the same, there's no need to bring this many. Bring about five. However, if all your lights are different, you will need to bring the full amount. This is going to be a long journey and could take days, weeks or even months, so you'll want to be safe.
Spare batteries. Along with your spare lights, you will need spare batteries. If all of your batteries die, you are very unlucky. Never fear though, just pull out your spare batteries and you're all good to go again. Bring about three packets of good quality batteries like Duracell. If you're bring cheaper batteries, bring more packets.
Spare reflectors. Just in case one breaks off, bring some spare reflectors. You will want to bring two or three red reflectors and two or three white reflectors. Although your reflectors are not likely to break, you may tie your bike somewhere and a thief may steal one. Usually, your safe ride would now be over but if you brought spare reflectors, you're all set to ride.
Cable lock. You will probably get hungry somewhere along the way. If you want to get off of your bike and buy some food, you will need to tie it up. If you don't, there is a good chance that somebody will come along and take it. To avoid this, buy a cable lock. You want one that comes with a lock, not a combination. Experienced thieves will easily be able to hack the combination in a flash but by the time they pick that tiny lock, you'll probably be finished. This is the one thing that you definitely don't want to forget, along with food. You can also get locks for the panniers, ask at an outdoor store for choices.
Tools. You can pick up some foldable tools that have allen keys, spanners, flathead screwdrivers and phillips screwdrivers in one, often known as a bicycle multi-tool––you will need all of these functions. If you can't find a multi-tool (but do check online), bring loose ones. You will also want to bring a small first aid kit and a puncture/patch kit. The first aid kit is for small injuries like cuts and scratches. Anything more serious and you can call an ambulance. The puncture kit is in case you hit a nail while riding––that's never fun but you need to be realistic. Although you've got to bring your bike to a shop as soon as this happens, the puncture kit will hold out until you get there. You also want to bring a bike tyre pump for when the bike starts to go flat, an extra tyre tube, tyre levers and an air horn to warn other people of your presence or to scare off unfriendly wildlife or dogs.
Sleeping/camping gear. If you're going to set up your own campsite now and then, you'll need a lightweight tent and camping basics. Choose items that are as light as possible, such as a one- or two-person tent, titanium cutlery and food gear, lightweight sleeping bag, etc. Ensure that sleeping items are in waterproof bags to prevent rain or puddle damage. Planning for sleeping along the way requires a bit more in-depth research, so you're advised to do some reading on the best options, either online or in travel cycling books.

, If you try to ride wearing jeans and a shirt, you won't get very far. You could also injure yourself if you fall, not to mention that you'll be very hard to see. Recommended clothes are padded, flexible shorts and a reflective or bright colored jacket. If you fall, the padded shorts will protect you and cars will be able to see you if you wear reflective clothing. If you don't have a reflective jacket, bright colours will do, although adding reflective tape to clothing is a fairly simple operation.


Have good rain gear. Cycling raincoats tend to cover your backside as well as your upper body, curving in with fitted elastic. If it's the warm season, you might be able to handle wet legs, otherwise consider also have rainproof pants. Any external jacket should be bright and reflective, especially rain gear.
Soft-shell jackets are a must-have for the cyclist. Perfect for cooler, windier days, these can cut the chill.
Riding gloves help to stop chafing and soreness, as well as improving your grip.
Choose clothes that wick away sweat. You will sweat, even in cooler weather. This kind of clothing is usually easy to ""stretch"" and has silky, cool feeling.
Sunglasses are an absolute must––not only to prevent glare but to help protect your eyes from insects and road stones.

, As well as wearing suitable clothing, safety involves a number of aspects when riding across the country. Good ways to stay safe include:


Have regular check-ins by phone or email with a friend or family member back at home. Give them general times to expect you to get in touch, which will allow them to know you're safe. If you've had any odd experiences, let this person know in case it's something that needs to be followed up.
Have emergency numbers keyed directly into your cell phone and keep it charged. Take along a solar charger for daytime charging as you ride. Obviously, sometimes you'll be out of range but many countries have emergency number options for times when your own provider is out of range.
Stay in public places if you ever feel unsafe. Call the emergency authorities for help from a public place if needed. Stay around other people if you feel stalked or followed and tell people around you that you need help.
Wear good clothes, a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen to protect yourself from UV damage.
Stay hydrated and eat frequently.
Stop when your body needs tells you it needs a break. This isn't the Tour de France.
If at all possible, ride as part of a team of people, not alone.

, After you've packed your bag, checked your equipment and planned a route, you're all set to go. Get your bike and leave home. Tell some people you are leaving and that you'll call them if anything happens to you or you need a lift in an emergency. Make sure that you're fit to do this, give yourself some last minute motivation and, above all, be prepared to have fun and keep your sense of humor about you.

, If you know that you can't ride for seven hours straight, why push yourself? It's okay if you don't finish a portion of your journey in one day, so be sure to take a bunch of breaks. If you brought food, which you should have, eat it so you're no longer hungry. If you're thirsty, have a drink of water. After you've eaten, wait for at least ten minutes before riding again so you don't throw your food back up. On your second or third break, it's possible that you would have run out of food. If that's the case, stop off at a local shop or fast food place to grab a bite or buy some more sandwiches. Enjoy the journey as much as reaching the destination.

Stay on as long as possible.",How to Ride a Bull," Though a single bull-ride takes all of 8 seconds, bull-riding takes years of practice and guidance from an experienced rider who'll show you the ropes. Aside from gaining access to bulls and the people who keep them, riding bulls requires that you develop proper riding technique and touch on your animal, something that you won't be able to learn overnight. Just as you would for any sport or trade, get a coach you can work with and who'll be excited to teach you.


Bull-riding trade magazines are widely available at rural outlets and feed stores, advertising a wide variety of open competitions, coaching options, and clinics with experienced pro riders if you want to learn the basics.
Bull-riding has historical roots in equestrian competitions between Mexican ranch hands, contests called charreada that tested a variety of overall skills.Now the sport is more professionalized, and the primary governing bodies in the US are the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) and Championship Bull Riding (CBR).
Born to Buck programs are widely available for youth who are interested in learning to ride bulls. Bull breeders hold open events to help interested parties get some experience on hot-bred animals. At the very least, you can learn if you've got the onions for it.;
, Learning to get comfortable on an animal with a relatively flat back will help you immensely if your ultimate goal is to ride bulls.Learn how to shift your weight and grip with your legs, riding an animal that isn't actively angry and trying to get you off. Building core riding skills is an essential first step in riding bulls.

, While there's little required of the bull-rider in terms of gear, you'd stand out (and wouldn't be permitted to participate in most competitive rodeos) if you weren't in basic cowboy gear. This includes jeans, button-up western shirts, and heeled cowboy boots, generally topped with the iconic cowboy hat.


Bull-riders always wear a protective leather glove and a braided bull-rope that wraps around the bull to hold on to. Pick a glove that's thin enough to grip tightly, allowing you flexibility in your grip, but also thick enough to offer some protection. The rope is generally treated with resin, which helps with the grip when it gets heated up.

, In competition, protective helmets and other gear aren't mandatory at most arenas, though are gaining popularity, especially in training and practice. Some bull-riders will wear a protective helmet, similar to a bicycle or motorcycle helmet, as well as a heavy vest to protect the internal organs.

, A good ride requires great balance and coordination, as well as the brute strength required to hold onto a bucking bull that outweighs you by a thousand pounds. Bull-riding training will include a great deal of basic upper body and core work outs, as well as leg-building exercise like squats.


Working out your arms with bicep curls will help develop the proper strength motion in your holding arm.
Developing a routine of squats will help build the leg strength necessary to grip the bull and hold on for dear life.

, A commonly-overlooked step in the bull-ride is getting somewhat familiar with the bull you're going to be sitting on top of. Spend a few minutes watching the bull in its pen, getting a sense of his aggression and tendencies. Watch the bull when he's ridden by other riders. Most bulls buck in one of two ways: head-down spinners and straight-ahead buckers.


If your bull puts his head down and turns upon leaving the gate, you'll know to shift your weight slightly and prepare for a tilt-a-whirl ride.
If your bull tends to head in a straight line, you can prepare for a more north-south type of bucking action and prepare yourself accordingly.
A common misconception is that bulls' testicles are bound to get them to buck. Their flank is bound gently to get them to kick their back legs higher, but their testicles are not touched or harmed in any way. Mostly they're bred to buck that way.

, When you're mounting the bull, get an experienced bull-rider to show you how to wrap your hand in the bull rope and get a solid grip. Generally, bull-riders grip underhand with their dominant (or writing hand), though some other grip techniques are becoming more popular. Let a helper pull your rope tight and wrap the rope once around the part of your hand that is closest to you.


For a basic grip, place your riding hand in your rope with the back side of your hand down. Your pinkie should be right next to the bull's backbone.

, Ease up to where you are nearly sitting on your hand. Make sure you stay that way for the entire ride and sit up off your butt. All of your weight will be on the inside of your thighs. Lean forward so that your chest is over the bull's shoulders.


When you mount, hold on to each side of the chute and ease your toes down on the bull's back and slide them down his side. Do not touch him with your spurs until you are ready to ride.

, Some bull-riders will say that the most difficult part of the ride happens when you're still in the chute, waiting. At some point, when you're sitting there on top of a monstrous-big bull who's huffing and angry that he's got an uncomfortable flank strap tied on to him, it might occur to you that this is a bad idea.Stay focused and think about the motions and the balance that you need to achieves, not the animal. It'll be over soon!

, As the bull's front feet come off the ground lean forward while squeezing with your legs and maintaining a tight grip on your rope with your riding hand, which acts as your center of balance on the animal. Keep your hips centered and square. When the bull starts to come down from the jump, push your hips to your rope and lift with your riding hand.


Try to stay as close to the center of the bull's back as possible. Miscalculating your balance and shifting even a couple of inches will have you eating dirt in a second or two. Focus on your core balance, created with your grip and your hips.

, Many novice riders move their free arm too much, as if they were doing some kind of cowboy dance. While it's true you can use your arm to offer some counterbalance, it's probably the least important part of the ride.


Watch pros closely. You'll notice, for the most part, that their free arm is fairly static. That's because most of the balance and the control they're getting is in the hips and the grip. Focus on those things and on keeping your free arm out of the way.
If you inadvertently slap the bull with your free arm at any point during the ride, you won't receive a score. It's important to keep control of your arm, while also letting it counter-balance and ""rudder"" yourself on the animal.

, You're not going to stay on the bull for much longer than a few seconds, so learning to get safely away from the bull and landing without seriously injuring yourself is a critical part of the riding process.


To dismount, wait for the bull to kick and then look over your riding arm (the one your hanging on with) and throw your opposite leg over the bull's head.
Try your best to land on your hands and feet, then run to the gate that's closest to you. Stop and look to see where your bull is, then go grab your rope to get clear.

, You'll only receive a score if you stay on the bull for at least 8 seconds. The time ends when either your free hand touches the bull or you feet touch the ground and starts as soon as the bull's shoulder passes the gate. The rider and bull are both given scores for their performance, which are tallied together to give the overall score.The bull is judged primarily on his difficulty. Judges look for the depth of the bull's drops, the height of his kicks, the directional changes, and the speed of his spins to determine a score.
The rider is judged primarily on the skill with which he controls the bull, anticipates the directional changes, and gracefully maneuvers and dominates the animal.
Rider and bull are given a score between 1 and 25, which are added together to give either a score out of a possible 100 or divided in half to give a score out of 50.

, Experienced and skilled bull riders are, in some ways, more like surfers than like wrestlers. It's not so much a test of animal wrangling as it is an ability to feel out the animal's movements and bucking pattern.


In general, thinking less and feeling more will allow you to ride the buck more effectively. The only way to do this is to practice like a demon. Ride bulls and stay healthy.

, This is sometimes called the bull-rider's mantra. It serves to remind you that most of the control and balance you'll achieve while on the animal comes from your lower body, gripping the bulk of the bull with your thighs and feet, spurring if necessary to control the bull's aggression. Without doing this, you're going to end up with a dirt lunch. Commit it to memory, both mind and muscle.

, Simply put, the longer you stay on, the better your score will be. 8 seconds is a lot longer than it seems, so learning to channel all of your attention and strength into an extremely short period of time is the biggest challenge to the rider.


Practice increasing the length of your rides and getting comfortable negotiating different bulls. Some riders suggest practicing on north-south type buckers before graduating to spinners, which are more unpredictable and difficult to ride. Once you've dominated them, give the spinners a chance.

Never bike into a road or street without stopping first.,
Check behind you before turning left or changing lanes and always signal.,
Wear your helmet.,
Obey the rules of the road.,
Always bike in single file, don't 'blindly follow the leader'.

,
Watch for left turning traffic.,
Watch for right turning traffic.,
Use a headlight when biking at night.,
Ensure your bike has reflectors both front and back, also reflectors on side wheels and pedals.

,
Get off your bike and walk if you are overtired, or in very windy weather, as you may wobble and be in danger .

,
Wear reflective clothing.",How to Avoid Fatal Crashes when Biking," Look left, then right, then look left a second time as cars coming from the left are on your side of the road, and so closer to you.;
, This involves practice. To practice go to a quiet area with minimal traffic.

, This may save your life. 7-800 people die from bicycle crashes, mostly from head injuries. Many others suffer permanent brain damage. Check your helmet regularly for wear and tear, replace it if you've been in an accident or after 6 years.

, Ride with traffic (on the right in the US). Always stop at the stop signs and red lights, even if the 'coast is clear'.

,, Often oncoming cars will misjudge the speed of a cyclist and turn left right into them. Be aware of oncoming traffic and look for signs that they will be turning left.

, Be ready to break if a car passes you then slows, as this can be a sign that they are about to turn right into your path of travel. This may also be a sign that they are yielding to an oncoming car that is turning left. Always be cautious when passing a car that just passed you.

, Never assume the motorist can see you.

,,, It is not advisable to bike in sandals or barefoot, wear comfortable shoes, or invest in special biking shoes.

Play until you win.",How to Play Handball," In team handball, the court is 20 meters (65' 7"") by 40 meters (131' 3"") large. Here are some things you should know about the court:


The court has a goal area line (also known as the crease), which is a 6-meter (19' 8"") line where only the goalie is allowed to stand. The actual goal is 2 meters (6.6 ft) high and 3 meters (9.8 ft) wide. Players can only jump into the goal area if they release the ball before landing there.
A dashed semi-circle that is 9 meters (29.5 ft) from the goal marks the free-throw line.
The line at half court is also known as the center line.
Get familiar with the ball, too. Traditionally, handball is played with a 32-panel leather ball. For women, the ball is 54–56 centimeter (21.3–22.0 in) wide and for men, it is 58–60 centimeter (22.8–23.6 in) wide and a bit heavier than the women's' ball.;
, There can be seven players on each team out on the court at any given time. One player on each team is the goalie and the remaining six are the court players. Each team can have a total of 12 players (in America) or 14 players (in England) dress and play during a game. The additional players can substitute for the players on the court once the player they are substituting leaves the court, just as in basketball, volleyball, or other sports with substitutes. The non-goalie players' roles are interchangeable during the game.


Players wear uniforms that are numbered 1-20. Each team's players should wear shirts and shorts of the same color, while each goalie wears a different color to stand out from the other teammates.
In official games, there are always two referees, one for the court and one for the goal. Their decisions are final.

, Each team scores points by throwing the ball into the opposing team's goal. The team that scores the most points wins the game. A game can end in a tie unless you're playing a tournament, which needs a winner to be named. If the game is tied after time runs out, then the teams play 2-5 minute periods of overtime.


A team can score a goal after the entire ball crosses the goal line and falls inside the goal. You can score a goal from any type of throw, which means the goal-throw, free-throw, throw-in, or throw-off (more information about these throws appears below).

, A traditional handball game is played in 2 30-minute halves with a 10 minute break in between. Youth or tournament games are shorter, played in 2 15-minute or 20-minute halves instead.


The time marked is the running time of the game. The only times the clock stops are for each team to have one time-out per half, and if there is an injury.
At half-time, the teams switch benches.

, These players can touch the ball with all parts of their body above the knee (which means no kicking!). If they have the ball, they can only stay in place for three seconds (think of it as a traveling offense in basketball), and they can only move for three steps with the ball. If they do not follow these rules, the ball goes to the other team. The players must quickly decide whether to shoot the ball, dribble it, or pass it.


A player can dribble the ball for as long as he wants, just as long as he keeps his hand on top of the ball. After dribbling, he still gets the usual three steps/three seconds rule. If he dribbles again, that's a ""double dribbling"" violation and the ball goes to the other team.
Other offenses that a player can commit include carrying the ball into the crease (the goalie's area), setting an illegal screen, and charging.

, Here's what you need to know about the different throws in the game:



The throw-off. The game starts with a throw-off. The throw-off takes place in the center of the court. Here, the thrower has to touch the middle line with one foot while all of the other players stay in their own half. The team that wins the coin toss and wants to start with the ball begins the throw off.

After the whistle blows, the player with the ball in the center of the court passes the ball to a team-mate and play starts.
Every time a goal is scored, the opposing team gets the ball for another throw-off. A throw-off also occurs after half-time.



The throw-in. If the ball leaves play, then the team that didn't touch the ball last gets a throw-in.

The free-throw. A free-throw is given after there's an interruption in play, and takes place wherever the play was interrupted. Play can be interrupted when one player is holding, pushing, hitting, tripping or hurting the other team's player and receives a penalty.

The referee throw. A referee throw is called for when the ball touches anything that is above the court after multiple rules are broken during simultaneous possession of the ball. In this situation, the referee stands at center court and throws the ball vertically, between two players of opposing teams, and they must jump and grab the ball or tap the ball to a member of their own teams. Other members of the team must be at least 3 meters (9.8 ft) away from the throw.

The 7-meter throw. This throw is given when a foul destroys a clear chance to score, the goalie carries the ball back to his own area, a court player plays the ball to his own goalie, or a defensive player enters his own goal area. For this throw, all players have to be outside the free-throw line and the player who takes the throw has three seconds to shoot the ball.

The goal-throw. This one is given when the ball rebounds off the goalie over the end line or if the ball is thrown over the end line by the team that is attacking. For this throw, the goalie throws the ball from his area and does not have to follow the three step/3 second rule.

, There are many ways to commit a rule violation. If one team commits a violation, then that means that the other team is awarded the ball, either as a throw-in, free-throw, or goalie-throw. Here are the different violations:Passive play. This means keeping the ball within one team's possession without trying to attack or to score. This basically means stalling with the ball.
Endangering an opponent with the ball.
Pulling, hitting, or punching the ball of of the hands of an opponent.
Making contact with the ball below the knee.
Diving on the floor for a ball that is rolling or not moving.
Outstretching your arms or legs to push, hold, obstruct, trip, or hit the opponent or to charge into a defensive player.

, These punishments occur when something that a player does warrants more than just a free-throw, such as any rule violations that are aimed at an opponent instead of the ball. Here are the stages of progressive punishments:



A warning/yellow card. Each player can only receive one warning for a rule violation, and each team can only receive a total of three warnings.

A 2-minute suspension. This is given for serious and repeated rule violations, illegal substitution, and unsportsmanlike conduct. You do not need a warning first to get a 2-minute violation. For this violation, the player sits out for 2 minutes and is not replaced, so his team has to play one player short.

Disqualification/red card. A player is given this as an equivalent of three suspensions that last 2 minutes each. After the first 2-minute suspension, the player can be replaced.

Exclusion. The exclusion is given for assault and the player is excluded for the rest of the game. This is a serious offense and this player's team is at a huge disadvantage because it has to play one player short for the rest of the game.

, There are many tips and tricks that can help you excel as a handball player, but the most important thing you can do is just to keep playing. Here are some things you can work on as you improve your game:To be a master handball player, you and your team should work on passing the ball to each other as much as you can. This is faster than dribbling and can get you to the goal more quickly.
When you are defending, you can work on keeping your hands up so that you block shots as well as passing opportunities for the other team.
When you're dribbling, work on using one hand to dribble while shielding the ball with your other hand to keep it safe from the opposing team.
Most importantly, just keep practicing! The more you play, the better you'll be at handball.

, Both of these games are played with a much smaller ball than team handball. Most official games are played with a ""small ball,"" or an ""ace ball,"" while street games are commonly played with a ""big ball,"" which is about the size of a racquetball.


There are three versions of the game (four-wall, three-wall, and one-wall), and the game can either be played by two players, three players, or four players.
Chinese is the easier of the two, in which the players bounce the ball against the ground once before it hits the wall, while in American, it doesn't bounce. If it doesn't make it in one bounce (Chinese), or if it bounces (American), it is the other player's turn to ""serve"".

, An example would be whether you want DBA (Double bounce American, where if it bounces twice, you must hit it American, used in Chinese), or DBC (American only, when the ball bounces twice, hit it Chinese).


You might want to rule out flagging, where the opponent is allowed to distract you but not interfere with the ball, or if you're on a team with someone, you might want team saves (where one person on the team hits the ball up, it bounces, then the other person hits it American).
This also goes with self-saves. You can have self-saves for either team or by yourself). You could even call Kings (none of the rules; just hitting it. Don't forget about ""slams"", where you can hit it as hard as you can).

, Usually, a player wins the game if he scores 7 points, but you can mix things up if you're playing a more casual game. Here are some other things to keep in mind as you're scoring the game:


There is usually a set score for when there is a shutout (when the opponent has 0 points the entire time).
The set score for shutouts when playing to 7 is 5. After the set score is decided, a player begins the game with a ""volley"" (throwing the ball either Chinese or American, depending on what you're playing).
Now the other person must hit it. This decides who gets the ball first.
The person that misses the ball after it bounces twice (once if playing Kings) will not serve first.
The game continues in the same matter, only there is no volley; just serving.

Check the weather and know the conditions of the tracks you're about to ride on before heading out.,
Prepare yourself before you set out for the ride.,
Prepare the bike for mud.,
Practice getting used to mud gradually.,
Be thoughtful.,
Learn some techniques for riding through mud.,
Enjoy it and don't be fastidious.,
Clean the bike.,
Finally, clean yourself.",How to Ride Through Mud," If you don't know the condition, presume that there is a high possibility of mud on the track if there has been rain recently or if it's of a temperature when a lot of dew forms on the surrounding trees and plants. If there are streams and other bodies of water running across the track, expect muddy conditions in some places. The other source of mud can be hikers, horse riders, and other sports users of the trail.;
, Dress appropriately for the weather, as always, but be sure to also add gaiters to protect the lower half of your legs from the mud. There's no doubt you're still going to get quite muddy but it won't feel as uncomfortable riding if your lower legs are fairly mud-free. Other things to consider include:


Many trails 'close' this time of year to avoid erosion; be aware of whether the trail you are heading to is one of them.
Wear eye protection. You can't always be sure what's in that mud. Hard objects and infection-creating particles can end up in your eyes if you're not careful.

, Your mountain bike should be prepared for mud at all times, so that it's easier to keep clean and protect it. Some things that will help include:Choose chunky tires; the wider the knobs on the tread, the more mud will be dispatched before it has a chance to congeal on the tire.
Good tires for mud-riding include directional tires (chevron pattern) and semi-slicks, a smoother tire that allows the bike to cut through the slime on the surface to reach for harder ground beneath. And slimmer tires (1 1/2"" (40mm) can be good in mud.
Spray the entire frame with lube. For simple muddy conditions, this can help to repel mud build-up on the frame.
Use a thick lube oil for the chain. It needs to be thick to stay on in the face of the mud. Although it's more expensive, chain wax is preferable, as it won't hold the grit from the mud like lube will. A heavy lubricant/protectant dissolved in a lighter carrier, such as a motorcycle chain lube or ""Boeshield T-9"" is easier to apply but still clings tightly.Keep tire pressure low, about 35–40psi. This allows the tire to mold itself better in the conditions.
Change the brake pads before leaving or take a spare pair. Brake pads wear down to the pegs or housing when you're constantly descending muddy declines; if it's wet, the mud acts like sandpaper, grinding away.
Add mud guards to the down-tube and front wheel to protect the front as best as possible.
Make sure the gears are well-cleaned before setting out. Mud can cause them to jump around otherwise.If you are a serious mud-rider, make sure that your brake cables and gear cables are of high quality, to allow for smooth shifts and braking when the mud is severe.

, Mud riding takes some getting used to initially, and it's important to realize that mud from one season may well be very different from mud that forms in another season, so knowing your local conditions and the bike's responsiveness to changes is something that will grow with time and experience.The ultimate aim for any mountain bike rider is to be comfortable riding continuously without having to reduce the pace, so tackling mud with dexterity should be a goal to include in your repertoire of off-road riding skills. As well as knowing how your localized conditions impact your riding, here are some generalized pointers about mud and watery trails:Mud creates a slippery riding surface.
Mud will slow down your riding, regardless of your skill with the bike. The more soaked the ground, the more the bike is likely to sink in to the ground as you ride through the mud.

Horse-riding trails after rain are not the off-road rider's friend. Avoid them as much as possible. Also avoid trails that are really boggy and clearly deep in mud.
Traction is hardest on clay or chalk trails that are wet or have mud.
Always take extreme care with corners. Tree roots on corners can cause you to slip right over. When approaching corners, be prepared stand up if a wheel spins. Use the brake sparingly when approaching corners.The wetter the trail, the more grip you'll have.
When there is a choice, always opt for trail that you can see over trail covered in mud and/or water.
Grass parts of a trail can provide traction between mud. However, roots and rocks can make it very slippery, and require experienced technique.Beware ditches of water, especially as a beginner and don't accidentally ride into them. Many trails have ditches to ensure that the water runs down the sides of the trail rather than eroding the trail; this is true for walking, hiking, biking, skiing, and horse riding trails in general; these can be useful for grip and cleaning the bike on occasion.

, Sometimes the challenge is so great that it escapes your mind that yet another bike riding this trail is causing erosion and damage for the trail, for future riders, for other users, and for the environment itself. If the trail is in such a bad state that riding it will just result in leaving great gouges and ruts, forgo the ride until the weather improves, or find a trail that's less messed up.

, Begin your sprint far before your bicycle reaches the mud patch. When approaching the mud patch, stay loose, in the saddle, and prepare for slippage. Where possible, keep closer to vegetation where the line on the trail will be less likely to be as muddy.When faced with slippage at high speeds, do not lean your bike one way or another or your tires will slip out and you will fall. Instead, steer with your handlebars and steer with preciseness. This will require a little leaning, however, it still gives your bike a centered balance as well as continued traction with your tires. It is also a good idea to spread your weight over the bike but if you need to slide back on the saddle (seat), use the bar ends.Keep pressure on the pedals.When approaching the exit of the mud, begin a sprint. You will feel the connection of your tires with the hard dirt and then pick up speed.
Lean back a little bit when going downhill to place your weight further over the back wheel.Your rear tire will bite more and your front tire doesn't really need all that weight on it anyway.
Don't do anything drastic! Your goal is to maintain speed, not increase it or change your line.
Always select the right gear before climbing or descending. With the descent, control your speed before reaching deep mud, or you might find yourself being flung off as you reach the mud., A lot of riders love mud because it tests the rider's skills and technique to their limits and well, they love getting dirty! After you've spent time getting used to the feel and learning how to keep your pace going even though the mud's in the way, you will probably find yourself relaxing about it more and starting to enjoy the experience every time.

, After every single muddy ride, be sure to clean your bike thoroughly. You'll be surprised where mud ends up, so you'll need to do a thorough inspection of the bike to ensure that the mud's removed from everywhere; look at the end of the handlebars, in between the chain stays, under the fork crown, etc. Wet mud is easiest to remove when wet, so try to clean your bike as quickly as possible. Be aware that removing dry mud with a dry cloth (easier for a thin layer) can also dull or remove paintwork.


Clean mud away from the sprockets using a sprocket scraper.
Hang the bike upside to dry after a muddy ride. This will help to ensure that water cannot rust the tubes. Just remove the seat bracket prior to hanging.Spray the bike with lube as a quick protection measure if you don't have time to wash the bike that same day.

, After a particularly muddy ride, congratulate yourself on using an ancient tradition for beautifying the skin but be sure to wash it all off thoroughly. A nice warm bath or a hot shower are ideal after a hard day's riding.


Clean inside and behind your ears, two places where mud can hide away.

Boxball is typically played on the sidewalk, but it is okay to play on an asphalt court as long as there is enough room. If played inside, only play in a designated area in a gymnasium.Do not play boxball inside of your home, or inside of any location that is not meant for sports. Playing inside could lead to items being broken or damaged by the bouncing ball.
Don’t play on grass. The ball will not bounce well.;
, Luckily, you do not have to find an opponent that is already skilled in the game. Boxball is a fairly easy game to learn. You can play with a friend, family member, or schoolmate. Just make sure the other person is willing to play.You may want to choose your opponent based off of your experience level. You can play with another beginner if you’re also trying to learn, or you can play with a more advanced player to better your game.

, You can wear any type of comfortable clothing to play. Stretchy clothing made for exercise is ideal. Wear athletic shoes with gripping soles, especially if you are playing on an indoor court.You can also wear knee pads, elbow pads, hip protectors, and and wrist protectors for added protection.

, The most ideal ball for this game is an 8.5 inch inflatable rubber ball. These balls are typical in schoolyards, and they are commonly referred to as “kickballs.” If you do not have this type of ball, you can play with any type of ball that bounces. A larger ball, however, is preferred.A spaldeen ball was originally used in the game. It is a smooth, pink, rubber ball that is similar to a kickball.A basketball can be a good alternative, but make sure it is not too hard. It may hurt your hand when throwing it back and forth.
You can also play with a tennis or ping pong ball, but the small size might make playing difficult.

, If playing outside, there is a possibility that you do not have to make a court yourself. Boxball was originally played on two sidewalk squares. You will just need to find two, spacious and adjoining sidewalk squares. If you aren’t in an area with sidewalk squares, you can make a court yourself. To make a court, you will need to use tape to create squares. Make the squares 8 feet wide, but you may want to make them smaller if you are a beginner.Use one inch masking tape.
Chalk can also be used to draw squares.

, To begin, each player will need to choose a square. It is best to start standing in the middle of the square. Once you are in one of the two squares, stand facing your opponent. The line between the two squares is the boundary. Do not cross this boundary at any point in the game.Do not step outside of any of the lines of your square at any point in the game.

, Boxball can be played using one or both hands to hit the ball. Either choice is okay, but you need to make a decision with your opponent. You might want to start by playing with both hands if you are a new player.You are allowed to use a reverse shot if you play with only one hand. A reverse shot is when you can use the back of your hand to hit the ball back.

, To volley, one player hits the ball into player two’s square. Player two hits back and forth until one person fails to return the ball, or steps outside of his or her own court. The winner of the volley gets to serve the ball.The serve can be maintained by the winner of the volley, or it can be rotated every five points.
A serve is made any time a hit has been missed, or when a player goes out of bounds.

, Hit the ball with an open palm back and forth to your opponent. Return the ball before it hits the ground, or when it bounces only once. A point is gained when the opponent misses a shot, or volley, goes out of bounds, or hits the ball outside of the opponent’s square.You have also lost the volley if you try to return the ball after it has bounced twice.

, Continue slapping the ball back and forth with your opponent until someone reaches twenty-one points. You gain one point when your opponent loses a volley.You must beat the opponent by two points to win.The score could go beyond twenty-one in order for someone to win by two or more points.

, The main way to improve at boxbal is to play regularly. Try playing a couple of times a week. If you can’t find anyone to play with, you can practice hitting the ball back and forth by throwing the ball up against a wall.Do not throw the ball up against any wall without permission. The wall needs to be sturdy, like brick, on the outside of a building.

, Play with as many people as possible, so you gain experience with a variety of opponents. For improvement, you might want to play with someone who is slightly more advanced at the game than you are. Playing with someone who is much more or less advanced can lead to frustration instead of conscious improvement.


It can be an occasional confidence booster to play with someone who is new to the game. Playing with a beginner will show you how far you’ve come, and you will be helping someone improve his or her game.

, You can agree with one person to practice on a regular basis. Find multiple people to play with for more challenge and variety. Boxball is only played with two people, but you can have several games going on at a time. Switch opponents after each game in order to play multiple games with several opponents within a practice session.You need an even number of people if you want to have multiple games going on at a time. This will give each person a partner during every game.

, Boxball has been called an outdoor game of ping pong, and a very small version of tennis. Boxball is also comparable to four square. Four square is a similar game, but it is played with four people. The rules and materials are not the same in these games, but playing these games will help develop skills needed to excel at boxball.Tennis requires rackets. Ping pong requires paddles. Four square is played with the same ball as boxball, and you only use your hands.

Learn about the various positions used in shooting.,
Learn about the types of guns.,
The basics of the shot process:


The first thing you must learn is that no shot will ever be accurate unless your body is as relaxed as possible.,
Sight Alignment.",How to Improve Your Shooting," There are many excellent books on shooting that can provide hundreds of pages of suggestions. One such book has about 25 pages on building each position (prone, sitting, standing, etc.), but one pretty quickly finds that there are many similarities between positions and many of the other techniques are identical for all positions.;
,


You can shoot them almost anywhere you have at least 5 yards of range. Ideally, you will want at least 11 yards (10 meters), but 5 is enough and almost everyone can find that distance.
Airguns are safe to shoot in enclosed spaces. No (appreciable) lead danger, little or no noise, easy to trap the pellet.
Airguns are cheap to shoot! You can buy pellets for about $0.02/pellet and shoot 100 shots for $2. 100 .22LR will run you at least $5 even if you have a place to shoot.
Airguns have little or no ""kick."" This means that you can concentrate on the shot process the entire time and never have to consider recoil (or noise).
David Tubbs is (arguably) the best shot in high power target shooting and shoots an FWB target rifle far more than he shoots powder guns. David is so good that it has been said, ""If David shot with a brick on his head, everyone would copy this.""
Good airguns don't have to be expensive. Crosman/Benjamin makes some very reasonable pistols and rifles that are incredibly accurate. You can spend $2000 or more on a top airgun, but you can get a very good one for a lot less that will be more than adequate.

, The more muscles you use to hold a position (even if you are standing!), the less accurate you will be. As noted above, books can spend 25 or more pages describing how to achieve a good shooting position but the guts are that you must be comfortable! It is suggested that you start with one of the easier positions when shooting -- for rifle, that will probably be prone; for pistol, standing. For prone shooting, you will need a mat or cushion to protect you from the ground or whatever you are lying on (Yoga mats work just fine!).
For all positions, the basic idea is that you have ""bone"" from the ground to the gun. Obviously, you can't literally do this. For prone, this is pretty simple since the gun is supported primarily by the left forearm (assume a right-handed shooter) with the elbow as much under the gun as is comfortable. If the elbow is splayed out to the side, the gun will be able to move around more (or you will have to use a lot more muscle to hold it in position) and the accuracy will suffer. For other positions, getting ""bone"" to the ground is more complex but the same ideas prevail: For standing, you will have your left hip slightly forward over your foreleg, your left elbow hard against your hip or ribs and the arm in a line to your left leg. The gun is then supported by the left arm which will be fairly close to the trigger so that there is a straight line of ""bone"" from the gun to the ground. These same ideas carry through to sitting and kneeling positions.
In pistol shooting (as in standing rifle shooting), you want to make sure your knees AND ELBOW(S) are not locked. It seems counter-intuitive, but when you lock a joint it takes more muscle effort to maintain position than if you joints are slightly relaxed. You obviously don't want to have your knees in a sitting position bend (or your elbow at 90-degrees), but you should find that accuracy improves very measurably when you have them ""soft."" Interestingly, in Yoga ""soft knees"" are the norm for the standing pose; copying that approach works for shooting, too.
Trigger control. The basics of trigger control are to release the shot with the least effect on the gun. Most guns can be dry fired safely. You must insure the gun is unloaded and the chamber is empty before doing this! Cock the gun and aim at your target. As you squeeze the trigger, you should not see any movement of the gun related to your trigger finger movement through the entire process which ends with the sear breaking (as if a shot were to occur if the gun were loaded). Once you can dry fire with no movement, you are ready to actually shoot the gun while following the same procedures you learned during dry firing. Go back to dry firing often to verify your ability to release a shot without affecting the alignment of the sights with the target.
Advanced trigger control. Most triggers have a stop so that when you pull back on the blade, it will eventually stop moving no matter how hard (within reason) you pull. You want to pull through to that stop when taking a shot and not release the blade until you are ready to take the next shot. This is called follow through. Most shooters want to see what happened and make some movement before the shot is complete. One aspect of airgun shooting of at least PCP airguns is that there is no movement of the gun even during the actual shot! Thus, one can watch the shot through the entire process -- for a powder gun with recoil the gun will move, but the idea is to pretend that you are watching that shot all the way to the target for every shot whether affected by recoil or not.

, An optical sight is generally far more intuitive for most shooters than iron sights. Many think that optical sights will make them more accurate -- in actuality, optical sights make it easier to see the target but if the target is easily visible (a bullseye, for instance), it is entirely possible to shoot as accurately with iron sights as with optical sights. The essence of sight alignment for either iron or optical sights is to align the front sight on the target while keeping the rear sight (if iron) centered.


The non-intuitive part of optical sights is that the cross-hair (dot, etc.) is the front sight. You want to concentrate on that front sight no matter what the target. This concentration will result in less over-correction when aiming and becomes vastly more important with higher magnification scope sights where the tendency is to align the target to the scope rather than concentrate on putting the scope on the target. As noted, this is not intuitive but does work.
In target shooting there are two approaches to sight alignment: Center of Mass (aim at the center of the bullseye) or 6 o'clock hold (aim just underneath of the bullseye). For optical sights, virtually everyone shoots center of mass. For iron sights, either approach can be used. In practice, younger eyes may prefer the 6 o'clock hold while older eyes will probably find the center of mass easier and more accurate.
For iron sights, the most important thing is for the front sight to be clear. This means that older shooters will have problems using distance vision eyeglasses since then the target will be clear and the front sight fuzzy. Having the target be fuzzy (and using a center of mass hold!) will usually work better. To achieve this ideal, you will need some optical help in the form of reading glasses or special shooting glasses. For most shooters, a prescription of +.5D to +1.0D is going to be needed. You can buy clip-on or drug-store reading glasses with +1.0D strength but lower-strength glasses are usually not available and you will have to ask your optician for a special prescription. One option is the Internet sources for glasses -- you can purchase complete frames and lenses from them for as little as about $10; you just enter your prescription adding .5 to 1.0D to the spherical value to get ""shooting"" glasses.

Determine the apex of the corner.,
Understand the importance of the apex.,
Plan the application of power through the turn.,
Plan for the continuation of the track beyond the corner.",How to Learn a Racing Line," The apex is the point on the corner that the racing line needs to run through for best effect. The apex of a corner is the point in the turn where the corner transitions from forcing the car into the turn to opening out to allow the car to complete the turning motion and resume a straight course. It is the point at which the radius of the corner comes closest to the road edge.;
, Definitions of racing line often refer to hitting the apex. Hitting the apex means that rather than hugging the road edge in the turn, the car starts out wide from the corner, sweeps in to just hit the road edge at the apex, and begins to sweep back out again. Ideally this line begins at the farthest possible side of the track from the apex, sweeps across the track to hit the apex, and continues to sweep out to the farthest possible side of the track leaving the corner. This line straightens out the corner into a longer but softer one, and the car can take the softer turning required at speed without losing traction and spinning out. It also means that the car comes out of the corner already at high speed and ready to race on, without needing to accelerate as much as it would have had it hugged the corner at lower speed.

, All braking should be done in advance of hitting the apex. Braking and beginning the turn towards the corner (called the turn in point) should be delayed as long as possible. Determining the limits of turn in and braking must be found through trial and error, as each racing car has different balance and braking capabilities. Once the apex has been hit, accelerate as hard as possible. Once past the apex, the car is out of the danger of spinning in the turn and should be brought up to straight line speed as quickly as possible.

, What follows the corner on the track will affect the line chosen for the corner.


Prepare for the straightaway. If the corner is followed by a long straightaway, the basic apex technique will work. However, many drivers intentionally change the line for a late apex (clipping the road edge later than the classically defined apex) if the corner is followed by a long straightaway. This late apex allows a racing car with good acceleration to apply power before the apex is hit. This technique is not recommended for slower racing cars.






Set up for the next corner. If the next corner is turning in the same direction as the corner that was just negotiated, simply follow the racing line for the first corner and it will drift the car out wide for the following corner, which is where the driver wants the car to be. However, if the next corner is in the opposite direction as the one that was just negotiated, the car comes out of the first corner on the wrong side of the track to take the second corner. The exit from the first corner must be flattened, rather than allowing the car to sweep out, which gives time to get the car back across the track for the following corner. This is accomplished by taking a later apex, but not applying full power out of the first corner.

Look directly at the spot which you would like to hit.,
Steady yourself.,
Throw in the intended direction.,
If you miss, try again.,
Take notes on how close you are to your intended target and try to avoid the mistakes you made the last time.

",How to Improve Your Aim," Try to focus on the spot and line up your arm with your line of sight.


If you are throwing a pointed object like a dart then try to make it's tip line up with the object.;
, While aiming, your hand should not shake. Stop for a moment and take a deep breath to steady yourself.

, Make sure that the throw is light and not too forceful as too much force will cause the object you are throwing to veer off course.


Imagine an arc from your arm to the target and try to throw it in that direction.Try to give the object a spin so that it stays on course.

, Practice makes perfect, the more you practice aiming the better you get.


Keep practicing for a couple of hours daily.

",How to Freeline Skate,"


A park or an empty car park will be the best for beginners due to the rails and walls present.;
,


Each freeline skate is labelled with L and R, which means there are specific skates for your left and right feet, just like shoes.







, Put your right foot on the freeline skate labelled with R with the tip of the shoe facing downward; then put the other on the freeline skate labelled with L with your foot at neutral position.

, Now you should be moving due to the momentum. Just put your feet down if you become unbalanced. Don't give up and keep the momentum going.

, When you are moving, move one of your feet in a horizontal S motion; this should allow you to skate further a little bit. Then try the other way round. It can be difficult for both legs to move in the carving motion simultaneously initially, so practice one leg first, then move on to both. If you get it right off the bat, just go with it.

, The wheels on each skate are facing different directions. Every time you practice, try to push your skates towards the direction the wheels are facing.

, Lift your foot away from the deck when you want to stop. If there is a lot of momentum, then run as you jump off the deck.

, Combine the above steps in practice, and you'll be freeline skating like a professional in no time.

Frequent biker establishments.",How to Look Like a Biker," Vintage and resale shops are often your best bet to find a good leather jacket or vest. If you can't find old leather biker gear you can buy a new leather jacket and beat it up until it looks like it has been on the road for years.;
, Guys and ladies should both own a pair of leather boots. Boots should be black or brown and have a buckle around the outside ankle and up around the top of the boot and a heel to help grip the pegs of the bike.


Boots for men should go up to the mid-calf.
A biker girl can wear boots that go up higher to around the knees. The bigger the better.

, Worn denim jeans in black or grey will do. Guys should avoid skinny jeans or baggy jeans. Slim-fit or boot-cut jeans will be pretty convincing. Distressed denim jeans will work well for ladies as long as they are tight.Holes in the jeans are optional. Consider adding some tears or rips to the jeans to create the right impression.
A denim biker jacket can be a nice change of pace from your leather jacket. A denim biker jacket should have large flaps across the chest and at least three zipper pockets on the front.
Wearing a black leather belt with your denim jeans is always a classy touch.
Avoid wearing too much denim at once. Ladies should consider a short, tight black skirt with a denim jacket. Guys might want to go with some grey or black work pants when wearing a denim jacket to maintain a nice balance.

, Whenever possible select black clothing. Black boots, black jacket, black shirt and jeans should make up most of your closet. It is possible to mix in a white shirt, or blue jeans, but try to avoid wearing that much color at the same time. Bright, cheerful colors can give off the wrong impression.


Ladies can wear jeans or skirts, and boots. Plus lots of biker jewelry, handbags and accessories. Fringes are fun and leather is necessary. Think black.

, Fold the bandana into a long strip and tie it around your head to create a do-rag. The doo-rag works great for keeping long hair out of your face and keeping grease and sweat from your hair from soaking into your motorcycle helmet.

, There is nothing a biker fears more than having his wallet fall out while riding. The chain wallet has become a staple to help bikers keep their bank, credit and library cards safe.


To attach chain wallet, clasp the latch end around front belt loop of denim jeans. Tuck the wallet, located at the opposite end of the chain, into the back pocket of the jeans.

, A tattoo is a crucial part of the biker look, but you have to select artwork that is appropriate for bikers. Tribal tattoos or Japanese characters won't work. Repeat this step several times for best results.


Guys will need to get a tattoo with skulls, flames, wings, guns, eagles, motorcycles or some combination of those themes.
Ladies should consider skulls, stars, roses, guns, pinup models and butterflies. These are all great starting points for a biker girl tattoo design.
If you aren't ready to commit to a permanent tattoo, consider shopping for a temporary tattoo that can be applied with water and comes off after several days.

, Ordinary crew cuts just won't do. Bikers need to have tough hair to match their tough persona. Ladies need to find a look that can hold up to the windy road conditions and still look sexy after the trip is over.


Guys should consider growing long hair and/or a beard. Growing long biker hair can take many years, so it's best to get started on this step immediately. The longer the hair or the beard, the more believable your biker look is. If you don't like dealing with long hair, consider going the other way and shaving your head. Either way looks extreme, which is the epitome of the biker lifestyle.
Ladies may consider various methods for braiding hair. This is probably your best bet for still looking your best when the bike helmet comes off., Nothing says ""I'm a biker"" quite like having a motorcycle. While not having a motorcycle won't prevent you from looking like a biker, actually owning a motorcycle will make your image a little more convincing to other bikers.

, You may want to pump some iron to help bulk up to fit in.


Guys should particularly look to add some muscle mass. Most bikers tend to have strong arms so work the biceps with curls and push-ups.
Ladies should seek a more toned physique with toned arms. Try a few lunges, squats and calf-raises to strengthen your legs for riding.

, If you want to look like a biker, you need to be seen where bikers hang out. Roadhouses and pool halls are a good place to start. If you can't seem to find any local hangouts, join a biker club. They often have their own club bars or a member's house they spend their time at.

Properly-fitting helmets are an absolute necessity - they're widely considered to reduce the chance of serious injury while skateboarding.In many places, like the State of California, wearing a helmet is required by law.If you're worried about injury, wrist guards may also be a good choice, as many of the most common skateboarding injuries are caused by falling onto an outstretched arm.Elbow and knee guards are also smart choices, especially for younger riders.
One final gear consideration - most standard J boards are rated to about 220 lbs and for roughly ages 8 and up. Normal J boards will work well for most teens and adults. However, there are special extra-small J boards for sale online - though their stated purpose is to make it easier for riders to perform tricks, they may also fit especially young riders better. It's not advisable for riders under the age of 8 to attempt to ride J boards.;
, Balancing on a J board when it's not moving is like balancing on a bike when it's not moving - that is, impossible. To get on your board safely, you will need speed - believe it or not, in terms of balance, faster is safer (up to a point). Try to get over any jitters you have about rolling around at moderate speeds on a J board. You may have some minor stumbles, but you'll have less than if you make the same mistake that so many aspiring skateboarders, J boarders, and cyclists make - going as slowly as possible out of fear.

, Once you think you're ready, it's time to take the first, crucial plunge into the world of J boarding. Place your non-dominant foot on the front part of the board. Plant your dominant foot squarely on the ground and push off to propel yourself forward. To accelerate, you can repeat this motion as you roll forward.


Like bicycles and other two-wheeled vehicles, J boards stay balanced as they roll forward because of a principle called angular momentum. When wheels in a bike or J board turn, they generate angular momentum. Sets of wheels with high angular momentum (in other words, vehicles that are turning quickly) aren't easily disrupted from their current direction by outside forces.When a J board (or bike, etc.) is stopped, it has no angular momentum, so it's very easy to topple over.

, When you've pushed off from the ground a few times, try lifting your dominant foot and placing it on the back side of the board. Turn your neck to see the area in front of you. The front of your body should be facing perpendicular to the board - not straight ahead.

, J boards have small wheels, so even with the benefits of angular momentum, they're difficult to keep balanced while moving in a perfectly straight line. Because of this, if you want to travel straight ahead, your go-to move will be a serpentine back-and-forth motion. Make use of the J board's central pivot to make a twisting motion as you roll forward. Tilt the front portion of the board towards the ground by pushing with your front foot while tilting the back portion of the board away from the ground by pushing with your back foot. Then, reverse.


This movement takes practice to learn, but stick with it. As a J boarder, this move is your bread and butter. It's very difficult, if not impossible to J board without this motion - it's as important to J boarding as riding without training wheels is to bike riders.

, Fun as it can be, sooner or later, J boarding in only one direction simply isn't going to cut it any more. It's time to J board into the second dimension! To turn, gently lean to the side you want to turn in and twist the front to the side you are going to turn. As you do this, twist the back part of the board the opposite way.


Lean gently. The precise amount you'll have to lean will differ based on how hard you're turning, but be careful not to lean too drastically before you're comfortable making more delicate turns.

, For basic, slow-speed J boarding, stopping quickly isn't an urgent concern - you can usually just jump off the board. However, as you become comfortable with higher speeds and begin J boarding around other people, it quickly becomes very important to learn how to stop quickly. ""Carving"" is an important skill for controlling your speed. To carve, turn fairly hard to either side with your front foot while keeping your back foot level. You'll know you're carving correctly when you slow down and your front wheel vibrates noisily. Lean forward, but try to keep your weight somewhat centered, as it's easy to lose your balance when carving. If you don't have enough room to carve, try one of these other techniques to slow down:


Grab nearby objects, like poles, railings, etc. Be careful - if you're going too fast, you can seriously hurt your arm or hand.
Swing your back foot wide as you make your serpentine motion. Try to get your back foot 90 degrees to your direction of travel - when you do, push with your back foot to slow down.
If all else fails, jump off of your board. You may still end up falling being hurt, but you won't run smack into anything dangerous in front of you. However, don't make this decision lightly, as the out-of-control J board can still hit someone.

, J boarding is definitely easiest on flat surfaces, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to J board for long without encountering a single slope. Even if you live in an extremely flat area, you'll still need to contend with ramps in parking lots and the like. Traveling uphill requires a more intense version of the basic serpentine motion, while traveling downhill requires lots of braking.


To power up hill, you'll need to put more heft in to your basic propulsive serpentine motion. Try to push harder than normal as you make each small curve - this motion requires practice to perfect.
Use caution when riding downhill. Rely heavily on your braking techniques and, if you ever feel like a certain slope is so steep you won't be able to control yourself, simply pick up your J board at the top of the hill and walk down.

, Your basic back-and-forth serpentine motion will get you far, but, for J boarding long distances, it can be somewhat tiring and inefficient, as it requires constant use of your muscles. If you need to go a long distance on a flat surface, gain speed, then use the cruising technique below to preserve your energy, which is more efficient, but offers little power for accelerating or travelling up hills:


When travelling at a good cruising speed, tilt both feet forward together so that the board strafes under you, then tilt both feet backward so the board travels back under you again. As you make these movements, try not to turn - keep the front of the board pointed forward and don't lean into your turns. When mastered, this technique allows you to ""cruise"", travelling forward at a constant speed without much energy input.

, The ""ollie"" is a small, controlled hop also used in normal skateboarding. It's the basis for many advanced tricks, so if you're interested in doing tricks on your J board, learning to ollie is a must. To ollie, while you're rolling forward, bend your knees and crouch. Jump with your front foot first, then with your back foot. This ""pops"" the back side of your board off the ground. Pull your knees up to your chest as you jump. In the air, slide your front foot up to the nose of the board in a rolling motion, which should level the board so that it's parallel to the ground. Try to land with the board as level as possible.


Because J boards have two wheels, learning to ollie on them is even harder than it is on normal skateboards. It may take you even longer to learn how to ollie than it took you to learn how ride the J board itself - stick with it and don't give up!

, You've learned all that's necessary to become a confident, competent J boarder, but don't stop yet. Once you've learned how to ride, learn how to ride with style! The number of tricks and stunts you can pull on a J board are limited only by your imagination and your commitment to practice, but use caution - whichever tricks you pursue, be sure to maintain a strong commitment to safety and a healthy degree of common sense. Here are a few ideas to get you started:


Sit down on your board. This simple but eye-catching move requires great balance and a sturdy pair of gloves - the latter for braking.

Do Kickflips, 360's, etc. Most normal skateboarding tricks can be replicated on J boards, but you'll have to contend with the added challenge of balancing on two wheels!
Grab the bar while riding. This requires extreme care so as not to hit your knuckles on the ground. Once you've grabbed the central bar, you can even try jumping, rotating the board as you're in the air, and landing back on it!

Learn from an instructor.,
Understand when to let go.,
Be careful not to execute a choke at full force during training.,
Practice on someone healthy or able-bodied.,
Begin from the ground.,
Stand or kneel behind your opponent.,
Wrap around your opponent's neck.,
Apply pressure.,
Hold until unconscious.,
Lay your opponent flat on the ground.,
Monitor your opponent closely.,
Administer CPR if necessary.,
Try out traditional resuscitation techniques.",How to Choke Hold," As you begin learning the chokehold, have a qualified instructor supervise and teach you the movements. Judo instructors, specifically, have extensive experience and background on the chokehold and because holds are potentially fatal, they should be treated seriously. When executed correctly, a chokehold should render your opponent unconscious, but not cause any injury or significant pain.;
, Because choke-holds can be dangerous, it's important that as you practice them, you are able to recognize when your opponent begins to lose consciousness. When this happens, it is good to immediately release pressure so your opponent can regain consciousness.


If your opponent begins tapping you or has obviously surrendered and submitted to defeat, let them go. Especially in practice, you don't want to continue applying pressure to your opponent when they have decided to let you win.
You will be able to tell your opponent is beginning to lose consciousness by a generally limp feeling in the body, sudden lack of resistance, changing color of your opponent's face, or eyes closing., When a choke is executed correctly, it can render your opponent unconscious in as little as 8 to 13 seconds. As you practice and train, a good rule is to only hold a choke for 5 seconds. , The chokehold is a safe way to subdue someone, but when applying to older people, very young children, or those who suffer from cardiac disorders or hypertension it can cause more fatal damage. Use common sense here when practicing., As training begins, your opponent will not be able to remain standing if you perform a standing chokehold, so it's good to start practicing from the ground. This will prevent injury caused from falling to the ground and will also give you better control.Stabilizing your position will also increase your ability to use your entire body.

, This will give you the best leverage and will leave your opponent in a position that is more unstable and thus more difficult to escape. Leading your opponent into a position in which it is hard for them to put up resistance will give you the best control and freedom of action so you will be able to achieve the best choke., With your dominant arm, reach around your opponent's corresponding shoulder and hook your arm around their neck. The bend of your arm should rest in the middle of their neck, and your fist should rest near your opponent's opposite shoulder. Then, clasp both of your hands together or put your other arm on the back of your opponent's head.


Sometimes it's better to wrap your arm around your opponent's weaker side, because it will be harder for them to escape your hold. Use your judgement to determine which side will allow you a better grip.
Practice getting an accurate hold with your hands the moment you begin the choke. If you continually release to adjust your position your opponent will have more opportunity to escape.

, Using your biceps and forearms, exert pressure on your opponent's neck around the carotid arteries, which are located on the right and left side of the neck.Using excessive force is not necessary, because the choke should depend more on technique and less on strength. If you find yourself having to rely on your strength, then your technique needs improvement., Look for signs like lack of resistance from your opponent, flushed face, or non-movement in the eyes. Once unconscious, release your opponent. They should regain consciousness within 10 to 20 seconds., This allows blood to flow naturally back to the brain after you have rendered them unconscious. Placing your opponent on their side and allowing their head to rest in their arm will prevent possible vomiting and will facilitate breathing., Pay attention to your opponent's breathing, making sure that their airway is open so breathing can be achieved easily.

, It should take your opponent less than 30 seconds to regain consciousness. After 30 seconds, if your opponent is still not breathing, contact medical authorities and begin CPR while waiting.If untrained in CPR, perform uninterrupted chest compressions of about 100 per minute until medical professionals arrive. Place your opponent on their back and place your palms, overlapping, in the center of their chest. With straight arms use your upper body weight to press down on the chest about two inches, and continue to repeatedly press down until you have performed 100 compressions. If trained, follow the acronym CAB to perform CPR. Do about 30 chest compressions. Then, go on to check the airway. Tilt the person's head back by using one of your palms to tilt the forehead back while you tilt the chin back with your other hand. Place your ear near their mouth and check to see if you can hear or feel breathing. Monitor this for only five to 10 seconds. If he or she is still not breathing, begin ""breathing"" or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. With the head titled back, place your mouth over theirs, plug their nose with your hand, and give two rescue breaths, lasting each a second long. If they still aren't breathing, continue the cycle of chest compressions, checking the airway, and breathing until paramedics arrive or your opponent has begun breathing normally., Massage the carotid triangle on the neck to manually simulate the carotid sinus or to open up a collapsed artery. You may also try massaging the chest or diaphragm to stimulate breathing.CPR is the preferred technique if your opponent remains unconscious because traditional techniques are considered advanced, but they may be used in special circumstances and with adequate training.

Educate yourself about the basics of the condition.,
Understand its dangers.,
Think about the causes of surfer’s eye.",How to Diagnose Surfer's Eye," The single largest identifying mark of surfer’s eye is a growth of tissue over part of the eye. This tissue may cause discomfort and may be noticeable to the naked eye.


The initial sign of surfer’s eye is the appearance of a yellowish growth, patch, or bump over the eye.
The growth of tissue will usually appear on the side of the eye nearest your nose.
The growth or lesion may also appear as pink, white, or even red.;
, Many people who suffer from surfer’s eye will wind up having the condition obscure or undermine their vision. Ultimately, any growth that limits your vision may be considered a symptom of surfer’s eye.


The growth might appear as a small dot or imperfection in your vision.
Your eyesight closest to your nose may be obscured.
Your vision seems blurred.
Anyone suffering from obscured vision should see a medical professional immediately. , Surfer’s eye is associated with a variety of symptoms that cause general discomfort in the eye. Coupled with other symptoms, symptoms of discomfort are a good indication that you may suffer from surfer’s eye. Symptoms that are associated with discomfort include:


Itching
A burning sensation
The feeling of grit or sand in your eye., An ophthalmologist is a medical professional that specializes in treating ailments of the human eye. If you suspect you have surfer’s eye, you should make an appointment with an ophthalmologist or have your primary care physician refer you to one. Upon seeing an ophthalmologist, they will:


Ask you about your symptoms. When they ask, be sure to accurately describe them. For instance, say ""I feel like there is permanently sand in my eye. It feels very gritty and makes it so I have to blink a lot.""
Make a vision examination of your eye.
They may conduct a standard vision test., This device allows an eye doctor to take a close look at your eye. The use of a slit-lamp is necessary for diagnosing almost all cases of surfer’s eye.


The doctor will examine your eye in very small sections.
They will look for any abnormal tissue growth.
The examination should last less than 30 minutes., Depending on the size of the abnormal tissue growth as well as your symptoms, your doctor will be able to come to a determination about the severity of your case. This is important, as depending on the severity, the doctor will prescribe different treatments.


Many examples of surfer’s eye do not require treatment. You may only need treatment if your condition threatens your vision.
Mild cases of surfer’s eye may only require eye drops or ointments. These drops are intended to ease pain, discomfort, and reduce inflammation.
There is a chance that your doctor may refer you to another doctor or specialist to help them form a diagnosis. In addition, the doctor might recommend more diagnostics., Your doctor's first step in treating your surfer's eye will be to prescribe eye drops. Depending on the eye drops, they may address both the condition and/or your symptoms.


Your doctor may prescribe drops to lubricate your eyes. This will relieve the dryness or gritty feeling you are suffering.
The doctor may prescribe you steroid drops. Steroid drops will relieve inflammation and may help reduce the size of the abnormal growth.
Consult your doctor before using eye drops to treat your surfer's eye., If eye drops don't work, your doctor may opt to surgically remove the pterygia. In most cases, this will restore your vision and eliminate symptoms.


You will typically be able to return to normal duties within a couple of days after surgery.
Your doctor might implant a medical device to contain the spread of abnormal growth in the future.
You will have to wear an eye patch for a day or two after the surgery., Surfer’s eye refers to the growth of tissue on top of the cornea of the eye.


Abnormal tissue is often known as ""pinguecula"" when it grows over the white of the eye and “pterygia” when it starts to extend over the cornea.
Surfer’s eye is associated with people who spend a lot of time outside in dry or windy conditions., Like many diseases, surfer’s eye manifests in different levels of severity. While some cases may be small enough to not merit immediate treatment, others can endanger your sight and require immediate action by medical professionals.


Pterygia may be small enough so that it does not cause discomfort or interfere with normal vision.
Pterygia sometimes grows to cause mild discomfort but may not threaten a person’s vision.
In severe cases, pterygia causes substantial discomfort and threatens a person’s sight., Although medical professionals cannot explain exactly why surfer’s eye appears in some people and not others, they agree upon several contributing factors associated with the development of the condition. If you are frequently exposed to these conditions, start wearing sunglasses that block UV rays for protection.Long-term exposure to wind.
Chronic irritation to the eyes caused by exposure to dry and dusty conditions.
Long-term exposure to ultraviolet light. If you work outside in a sunny environment, you are at a higher risk of developing surfer’s eye."

Practice stopping while skating down a hill.,
Use the proper safety gear when skating.,
Find some friends to ride along with.",How to Do Land‐Based Surfing," Wherever you choose to do your land-based surfing, you’ll need a type of longboard to use. Longboards, unlike typical skateboards (sometimes referred to as “short boards”), are never used for tricks, but only serve to provide transportation and to descend hills. Long boards come in a variety of sizes (both lengths and widths), and can be customized with different sizes of wheels. Ask the skateboarding shop staff what they would recommend for someone with your level of experience (likely novice).


Although you can purchase a longboard online, you’ll be able to look at and possibly stand on a variety of boards if you visit a physical skate shop.;
, When selecting the wheels, smaller wheels will give you a lower center of gravity and probably more accurately mimic the feeling of “surfing” along the ground. However, if you think you’ll be doing land-based surfing in an area with rocks and choppy concrete, opting for larger wheels will give you more ability to roll over these small obstacles.


Ask for a wheel-size recommendation at the local skate shop. Explain to the employees (who will doubtless all be skaters themselves) that you’re planning to try land-based surfing and ask what size wheel they would suggest.

, Trucks are the metal attachments which fix to the bottom of a longboard (or any type of skateboard); each truck has an axle running through it, and one wheel attaches to each side of the truck. Since you’ll want your land-surfing longboard to mimic the feeling of a surfboard and to be able to turn relatively quickly, choose a longboard with plenty of distance between the trucks to provide a smaller turning radius.


You’ll want one truck to be close (within 3 or 4 inches) to the nose (front) of the longboard, and one truck to be near (within 4 inches) the tail (back) of the longboard.

, Hamboards is the brand most associated with land-based surfing; they manufacture high-quality longboards that mimic the feeling of riding waves.Hamboard boards, and other longboards designed to be ridden like a surfboard, are designed to ride smoothly and are used by both surfers and skateboarders to perform surfing-inspired maneuvers (carving turns, hanging ten off the nose of the board, etc.) on concrete hills.Hamboards are manufactured both in the United States (Huntington Beach, CA) and in Europe (Amsterdam). You can order Hamboards online, but if you live near either Huntington Beach or Amsterdam, stop by a local skate shop and check out the boards in person.

, Longboards that have been designed for land-based surfing come in a variety of lengths and shapes, from short and rounded—which facilitates “pumping”—to long and streamlined, which facilitate speed and carving. Boards range in size approximately from 2 to 5 feet long, and in width from 14 to 10 inches. To determine which board is best suited to your needs, consider if you want a board that’s more designed for carving and can make sharp turns, or one more suited for long-distance cruising.Additionally, certain boards are more or less portable, depending on their size, and others are designed to allow riders to “nose ride” or mimic surfing by standing at the very front of the board.
These longboards can get expensive quickly. For example, Hamboard prices start around $155 and rise to $500, so you may need to save up before making a purchase.

, The ideal hill for longboarding or land-based surfing is one that is relatively free from traffic or pedestrians, long enough to allow you to skate for several minutes without having to stop and walk, and made with relatively smooth concrete. Drive, walk, or bike around town to scope out potential locations.If you live in a rural area, you’ll likely need to travel in order to find a location for land-based surfing. There are types of skateboards with large rubber wheels suitable for rolling over dirt and rocks, but using these boards is not considered a type of land surfing.

, Suburbs often offer good longboarding locations, as they are not as densely populated as more urban areas, and feature interconnected, wide roads. Look for roads that are smooth and well-maintained. If you find yourself skating down a section of rough asphalt or a poorly maintained section of road, you may have a harder time maintaining speed and keeping your balance when carving.


Be mindful to avoid stretches of road or sidewalk that have potholes, down trees (or other obstructions), or that end abruptly at the bottom of a hill.

, If you’re running out of ideas of locations to use for land-based surfing, open your computer and find a hilly area near your location on Google Maps. On the left side of the screen, turn on the “Terrain” feature; this will show the topography of the region. Shaded ground indicates the presence of hills and other topographical features; zoom in on areas of interest. Follow the course of the roadway to make sure that it doesn’t feature any impossibly tight turns or dead ends.If the road looks safe and has the right amount of incline, grab your board and check it out

, You can also use the website Findhills to locate hills for longboarding or land-based surfing. Findhills will use an online map to indicate the distance that a road along a specific hill covers, the relative steepness of the road. The website will also identify the single steepest section of the road you’ve input.The Findhills website provides a helpful tutorial if you find its interface confusing. It’s generally straightforward: click two places on a map to find the change in elevation between the locations.

, Longboarders and land-based surfers often make use of dry drainage ditches, as they often provide an ideal location for skating: away from cars and pedestrians, made entirely of smooth concrete or cement, and at a consistent downhill angle. If you find a suitable drainage ditch, try carving up and down the walls to mimic the feel of surfing a wave.


Drainage ditches used for land-based surfing should be at least 10–15 feet wide; don’t try to skate in a smaller, backyard-sized ditch.

, A landpaddle is a lightweight metal pole, several feet long, which has a hard plastic knob on the end. Land-based surfers will often use a landpaddle to help balance, carve, and facilitate sharp turns while on their longboard. When you use a landpaddle while surfing, press the hard rubber tip against the ground to keep your balance when you’re leaning to make a sharp carve.You can also use the landpaddle to propel yourself without using your feet.

, If you haven’t skateboarded, snowboarded, or surfed much before, just balancing on a longboard can be tricky. Practice on a small hill or even on flat ground: push yourself along with your foot (or paddle), make a few turns, and get a feel for the center of gravity of the longboard.


As you gain more confidence while skating, you can move on to steeper and longer hills.

, It can be difficult to slow or stop a speeding longboard, but it’s a necessary skill. You can slow down by dragging a foot behind you, by steering the board uphill, or by dragging your landpaddle along the cement. If you need to dismount suddenly, you can just leap off the board and take a few running steps to slow yourself down, then retrieve your longboard.

, When skating down hills or on roads, plan to wear a helmet—and perhaps knee and elbow pads as well—since you’ll be putting yourself at risk by moving at fast speeds over hard cement, concrete, or asphalt. It’s especially important to wear safety gear when practicing. After you’ve become proficient at land-based surfing, you can decide whether or not you want to keep wearing safety gear. When you first start out, though, you’re certain to fall many times and need to protect yourself accordingly.


All of these safety items can be sold at your local skateboarding shop.
You’ll need to be especially careful and aware if you’re skating on a roadway that’s currently in use by motor vehicles.

, Like surfing itself, land-based surfing can be a very communal sport; it’s fun to spend an afternoon descending hills and drainage ditches with friends, and a great way to meet new people as well. Other land-based surfers—especially more experienced ones—will likely also have suggestions of new hills to ride or drainage ditches to skate through.


If you’re practicing land-based surfing on or near a roadway, make sure to check for traffic before venturing into the street.

Transfer your weight onto the front leg after attempting the change of angle.",How to Change the Angle when You're Surfing," Pack it down nice and firm and place your surfboard on it. Step on to the board leading your back foot, trim the board and hold the correct surfing stance with the surfboard balanced on the sandcastle.

, Remember your surfing style and always keep your head up, looking forward, back straight and knees bent.

, The following is an explanation of how it can work.

, (The frontside for a natural foot surfer is to the right and for a goofy foot surfer is to the left.).

, Immediately after changing the angle, you should shift your weight to the front leg as to accelerate the board and keep surfing the wave. But now you would be cutting across the wave in a new direction.

, Remember your wave catching skills, jump or step up cleanly to your feet and start to trim the surfboard and surf the wave towards the beach.;
, When you feel you have control of the surfboard and are comfortably surfing the wave, shift your weight to the back leg, rotate your upper body, shove your hips and attempt to change the angle the surfboard is facing, transfer your weight on to the front leg and accelerate across the wave in the new direction and continue to trim the board.

, This will allow you to continue surfing and you could attempt another change of angle on the same wave.

Race against yourself.",How to Do a Sprint Triathlon," Assuming you are reasonably physically fit, you still need two or three months to train specifically for a triathlon. You don't necessarily need a triathlon coach, but you do need a specific workout plan.Check listings to find races taking place near you, and sign up for one that is at least two or three months away. That will give you time to train.
For your first race, try to find one as close to you as possible. Traveling to another location for the race is an additional element that you don't want to worry about your first time out.
Find a basic triathlon training guide and do the workouts yourself. When you're just starting, there's no need to invest in a trainer or coach.;
, Even if you already have a relatively healthy and well-balanced diet, eliminate all junk food and soda in the months before your sprint triathlon. The fuel you put into your body is just as important as any other part of your training regimen.Your meals should consist of lots of fruits and vegetables, as well as plentiful lean protein. Bananas have the starch you need as well as potassium, so they are good pre- or post-workout snacks.
Eggs are a good source of protein, as are meats such as chicken and turkey.
Keep in mind that you'll want to eat breakfast at least two hours before the race. Three or four scrambled or hard-boiled eggs and a banana will give your body the fuel it needs for the big day.

, Races can be won or lost in the transition zone. Planning a smooth and efficient transition and practicing transitions regularly before your event can make all the difference in where you place in the race.Set up a specific training area to work on your transitions, and time yourself. Get a copy of the triathlon rules so you can plan the most efficient transition methods that will avoid potentially costly penalties.
Practice getting into your bike shoes and helmet, as well as dismounting your bike, removing your helmet, and switching into your running shoes.
Use elastic laces rather than regular laces in your shoes so you can slip them on and off.
The more you practice your transitions, the quicker and more efficiently you'll be able to do them. Don't add any new tricks come race day that you think might carve a second or two of your transition time – stick with what you've practice.

, Generally, you should try to swim once or twice a week, bike once or twice a week, and run at least five days a week. However, if you are a weaker swimmer or biker, you may want to add another session.Many beginning triathletes are most nervous about the swimming portion of the race. Fortunately, it is the first part and will go by quickly. You don't need to be a competition-level swimmer. However, you should be comfortable in the water.
If you aren't a strong swimmer, you may want to swim three or four days a week instead of just one or two. Focus on spending time in the water and being comfortable there.
The same goes for biking as swimming. If you aren't a particularly strong biker or don't have experience with racing, you might want to spend a little more time each week on your bike.
The most important thing about each part of the event is not to be the most technically proficient, but to be comfortable and efficient at each skill.

, Especially for your first few races, don't worry about spending a lot of money on fancy professional-quality race gear. Make sure you have a good pair of running shoes, but for everything else you typically can get away with equipment you already have.For example, for the swimming portion of the triathlon, many pros wear expensive wet suits. However, if you don't have a wet suit, don't feel as though you have to run out and buy one – a regular swimsuit will work just fine.
You also don't need a fancy new bike. You can use any bike, and if you already own a bike you're comfortable riding, it's better to use that than to try to break in a new bike in a few short months.
During your training, use the same gear you plan to use for the race. This means if you do plan on buying anything new, you should buy it before you start training. If you race with new or different gear than what you trained with, it can throw you off.

, Brick workouts include two of the three disciplines in the triathlon, with the transition between the two in between. These workouts get you ready for race day by getting you used to doing one activity after another.Go the same distance as you would during the race. For example, if you're doing a brick with swimming and biking in preparation for a sprint triathlon, you would swim for a half-mile, transition to your bike just as you would in a race, and then bike for 12 miles.
Brick workouts give you experience doing one discipline after another, so you know how your body feels and how you react. It also gives you an opportunity to practice the transition in simulated race conditions.

, Especially for your first race, take the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the course and talk to the organizers. You'll have more time to do this the day before the race than you will if you wait until the morning of the race.The organizers will provide a basic run-through of the triathlon rules and give you a detailed explanation of the race. You also typically get the opportunity to walk through the course so you can plan your approach and transitions.
For example, if you look at the swim-to-bike transition and the start of the biking portion of the triathlon, you'll be able to tell what gear your bike should be in when you start off.
After you have a few triathlons under your belt, or if you're running on a course with which you're already familiar, you won't need this additional prep time.

, If the swim portion of your triathlon is in a pool, your position will be more defined. However, in open water swims, your position can keep you out of the hectic chaos of the scrum of swimmers so you can keep a cooler head.Even if you're a strong swimmer, it's easy to panic in the rush of swimmers splashing around you – especially if you have limited experience swimming with dozens of others in open water.
The difficulty of the swim is that it's difficult to practice with enough others that you can replicate the experience of a race. On race day, make sure you have enough room as you enter the water.

, Focus on your stroke and your breathing rather than getting distracted by the other swimmers around you. Staying calm under pressure will help you succeed in the swim portion of your race and get your best possible time while still conserving energy for the next two legs of the race.Go at your own pace, and keep in mind that just because someone near you is splashing a lot or stroking more rapidly doesn't mean they're going faster than you.
If you lose your cool, roll over onto your back and take a few deep breaths to calm yourself before you resume your stroke – remember, the swim only represents one-third of the entire race. Even if you finish the swim in first place, you still have biking and running to do.
It can be tempting to start out the race and want to go as fast as you can – it is a sprint triathlon, after all. However, keep in mind that the biking and running legs of the race are longer than the swim, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to make up time.

, Your strokes should be clean and efficient, but you don't need the most technically proficient stroke, especially if your swim is in open water. Propel yourself forward with long, controlled strokes.Use your training time to improve the form of your stroke and improve your time. During the race itself, replicate your practice swims as much as possible.
Swim on your side to elongate your body and get as much force and efficiency as possible out of your stroke.
Safety often is more of an issue during the swim leg than the other two legs of the race. Swim in a way that you are comfortable.

, As part of your training, you should learn how to look ahead and keep swimming straight. During the race, only look down or forward. Glancing to the side or looking at other swimmers can get you off track.Every few strokes, try to pick your head up so you can look ahead to make sure you're not moving off course. This is particularly important if you're swimming in open water, because you won't have the benefit of lane markers to help guide you as you would in a pool.
Make sure your kick is strong even as you're looking ahead to keep going straight to your goal.
Find the easiest line to each buoy and follow it. Looking up frequently allows you to adjust course if another swimmer gets in your way or disturbs your line.

, As you reach the end of the swim leg of the race, focus on swimming as long as you can if you're swimming in open water. Kick harder to propel yourself forward and make up as much time as possible going into the transition.Even if you can feel your belly brushing against the bottom, keep swimming until it's possible to stand up and run to the transition area. Standing too soon can take precious seconds to trudge through knee- or shin-deep water.
When moving to the transition area, take short, controlled strides and keep your feet strong and secure. You may want to practice running on sand if the swimming leg of your triathlon will be in open water.

, The morning of your race, check your bike's tire pressure and put it in the gear you'll need it to be in for the first part of the bike race. This will save you precious seconds during your transition.Your tire pressure should be somewhere between 80 and 120 psi. This will make your ride smoother as well as enabling your bike to go faster.
You also want to keep a sports drink on your bike. While there may be aid stations giving out water during the bike leg, a sports drink will help replenish electrolytes and give you a more substantial energy boost.

, After the swim, your legs will be used to kicking. To start the bike leg of the triathlon out strong, give your legs time to loosen up and adjust to the different motion before you get into your pace.After the pause of the transition, it can be tempting to start out the bike leg going as fast as you can go. But it's better to save your energy so you can make a move later when you've mentally transitioned from swimming to biking and are well in control.

, Push downward and pull upward with each pedal rotation to get the most power out of your pedal stroke while biking. Make sure your seat is adjusted properly so that when the pedal is all the way down, your leg is between 80 and 90 percent extended.Keep your elbows bent and your arms loose. As you go over bumpy terrain, your arms will act as shock absorbers.
Lean forward at about a 45-degree angle and keep your head up. Your eyes should be focused on the road ahead. Don't look over at spectators or at other riders.

, Don't get so hung up on the racing aspect that you forget the rules of the road. Riding a bike by yourself during training is significantly different than riding with a large group of competitors.Maintaining focus on the road in front of you is the best way to avoid a possible collision. Don't just look immediately in front of you, but also further afield so you can anticipate possible problems and adjust before things get too tight.
Ride on the right-hand side of the road. If you need to pass a slower competitor, shout ""on your left"" to them before you pass.
Keep in mind that all competitors are tired, nervous, and full of adrenaline from excitement over the race. The best way to avoid a collision is to maintain control at all times.

, By the time you reach the running portion of the triathlon, you may be exhausted. Take smaller steps and focus on finishing one mile at a time and the last leg of the race will go by more quickly.Stretch yourself tall and look straight ahead, keeping your eyes on the prize.
The last leg of the race is a good time to refuel, so accept water at every aid station. You also may want to bring sports gels or energy supplements with you (you can pack them on your bike or in a waterproof pouch in your suit) so you can power through your final run.
You may have difficulty if you don't really enjoy running, but tell yourself that this is the final leg of the race and the finish line is just a sprint away.

, If you hit the ground mid-foot, you can power through your run more efficiently and won't over-extend your legs. A broader stride may cause you to hit the ground with your heels, which will burn precious energy.Your arms should swing forward and back naturally. Avoid clenching your fists or swinging your arms side-to-side, which wastes energy.
Keep your stride light. Use your momentum and force of motion to propel your body forward, rather than pounding the ground.
Your shoulders should be back, your head straight. Look 20 to 30 feet in front of you so you can anticipate and adjust for other competitors in your way who might cause you to break your stride.

, Think of the triathlon as a race against your best time, rather than a race against your fellow competitors. All of you are competing for a personal best, not competing directly against each other.In all legs of the race, paying attention to other competitors can be distracting and cause you to lose focus. If you're not careful, this can result in accidents or collisions.
Keep your eyes ahead, and only give other competitors as much attention as is necessary to adjust your course or pace to avoid running into them.
Avoid looking at the race as a whole, or thinking ahead to other legs. Instead, focus on what you're doing and keep your attention on the next stroke, the next turn, the next step. Each of these little goals adds up to a finish that you can be proud of because you know you did your best.

Select a boogie board that is the appropriate size for you.,
Go to a swimming beach that has 1- to 2-foot-high waves.,
Secure the strap to your wrist or just above the elbow before entering the water.,
Enter the water and lie down with your belly on the board.

,
Kick and paddle to where the waves are breaking.,
Choose the wave you want to ride.,
Get in the ready position.,
Start paddling and kicking toward the beach in the same direction the wave will break.,
Scoop the water with your hands to gain speed.

,
Catch the wave!,
Lean left to turn left; lean right to turn right.,
Turn at the bottom of the wave without losing speed.,
Do a cut back.,
Do a 360.",How to Boogie Board," When standing on its tail, the board should reach to the level of your belly button. You should be able to hold the board under your arm and against your side without much slack between your armpit and the edge of the board. Make sure that an arm or wrist strap is attached to the board.

, Make sure that the beach is free of large rocks, boats and fishing equipment.

, You don't want to lose your board in the current!

,, When a wave is about to break, you will see a bulge form at the highest point, or the crest, of the wave.

, Not every wave will be strong enough to carry you. Attempt smaller, non-powerful waves at first and work your way up to larger ones.

,


A few seconds before the wave starts to break, point the nose of the board toward the beach.
Lie flat on your belly, with your hands a couple inches down on the side and from the top.
Keep your shoulders parallel to your hands, with your elbows bent and resting close to the outer edge of the board.

, Getting ahead of the wave will help you catch it.

,, If you have paddled the board at the right speed and in the direction of the wave, you should now feel yourself moving effortlessly toward the beach. You should no longer need to kick or paddle, as the wave will do the work for you.

, You can ride a wave down the beach (""ride in the barrel"") by positioning yourself on the board in a way that enables you to apply weight to either side of the board as the wave starts to push you towards the beach.;
, A good bottom turn is the foundation for all other maneuvers, such as 360's.


As the wave catches you, keep your hands over the nose of the board.
Lean onto your elbow to dig the edge of the body board into the wave.
Extend your legs as you turn to prevent your feet from dragging in the water.
After you start to turn, center your body weight on the board and lean forward slightly to gain speed.

, A cut back is a turn back to the curl of the wave that you can do to regulate your speed or to reposition yourself along the wave. Start by doing a turn on your left to just under the top of the wave.
Shift your weight on the outside rail (away from the wave) while applying pressure with your right hand to the middle of your right rail.
Lift up the upper left corner of the board with your left hand and lean to your right.
Look at the inside of the wave and visualize the spot where you want to stop your turn.
When you reach that spot, lean left to get back in the curl of the wave and shift your weight back to the normal position.

, After you've mastered the bottom turn and the cut back, try a full rotation. This can be done on the flat section of a wave, in the white foam, off the lip or even in the air. The technique is the exactly the same wherever you attempt a 360. Make a bottom turn to position yourself in the curl of the wave.
Turn slightly to the left to face the wave.
Slide forward on your board so that your face is roughly level with the nose of your board.
Lift your legs, arch your back and throw your head to the left.
Keep looking in the direction you want to spin and your shoulder will follow.
After your 360 is complete, perform a bottom turn to gain speed for the next maneuver and put your feet back in the water.

, A lot of Australia can be surfed. Some of it's crowded though while other parts are shark havens. Then again, a lot of it's deserted, so you're just going to have to ask around and trust the locals. Good spots include:


Gold Coast (but crowded)
South Stradbroke Island
Bells Beach Victoria
Byron Bay
Sydney (the surf city in Australia).

, There is some great surf here, especially in the Eastern Cape province.


Try Jeffrey's Bay.

, If you don't already live or frequent this state, it's the state for surfing. The water tends to be cold and crowded but it's good surfing all the same.


Try Malibu, Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay and Steamer Lane.

, Bali has excellent waves, especially around the Bukit Peninsular. A major drawback though is the crowd likely to be sharing the beach with you, including people touting their wares.

, There are some good surf beaches around Joaquina Beach and Santa Catarina island.

, It has great beaches in many places. You may have difficulties getting around though, so be prepared for rough roads.

, Hawaii is well known for its great surfing beaches. The best beaches depend on the type of waves you're after. Good beaches include Sunset Beach, Pipeline, Waimea, Ala Moana, etc.

, Within any destination in any country, there will be better places to surf and not-so-great places to surf. Some of this will depend on the season, some on the nature of the sea, and some on whatever is happening with the local tourist industry. It pays to do very localized research once you've chosen a location so that you can find the best waves, at the best time of year, and try your absolute best to avoid the crowds.

Soften the wax to make it easy to remove.,
Start scraping the board with the non-serrated side of a wax comb, old credit card or any other similar implement.

,
Continue scraping till all wax has been removed from the board.,
Roll the wax ball over the board to pick up the remaining pieces of wax that linger in a few spots.,
Re-apply wax if doing so.",How to Remove Wax from a Surfboard," You can soften using any one of several techniques:


Put your board in direct sunlight for a few minutes. On a warm day the wax will be turn shiny and slightly gooey within a few minutes, making it easy to scrape off.
If sunny weather won't oblige, pour some hot water onto the board.
Point the hot air from a hair dryer set on low to a spot right before you scrape.
Do nothing. If you don't have the time or tools to soften the wax, you can still get rid of the old wax. However, not softening it will make the scraping that much more difficult and slightly less effective.;
,,


There are some products available (e.g. ""Pickle Wax Remover"" by Team Chow), which you rub over the board after removing most of the wax by scraping. This will help with removing those last bits of wax. Pure melted coconut oil can achieve the same effect. If rubbed off with a wool blanket scrap, the scrap can then be composted., Dispose of the wax ball responsibly.

, (This is optional.)

Avoid areas where sharks are likely to feed.,
Look for warning signs.,
Stay out of the water during prime hunting times.,
Avoid murky water.,
Consider surfing in areas dense with kelp.,
Take a break during the month of October.",How to Avoid Sharks While Surfing1," There are the obvious spots, like near fishermen or fishing boats, where bait, injured fish, and blood and guts are plentiful and may attract sharks.Other potentially dangerous areas include:


River mouths and channels. This is where food, dead animals, and fish that are flowing down-stream enter the ocean, making them great spots for sharks to hang out.Areas where sewage enters the water. The sewage attracts fish, which will attract sharks.Deep channels, near sandbars, or where the reef or sand drops off steeply. Sharks lurk in these areas to catch fish that wander out of the shallows.Where large groups of shark prey hang out. If there are seals pupping nearby or a population of other marine animals in the area, sharks may be hunting nearby and could easily confuse you with prey.;
, If sharks have recently been sighted, there should be warnings posted on the beach - heed them. If the beach is closed, come back another day., Sharks generally feed at dawn, dusk, and night, so stick to late morning or afternoon sessions., Most shark attacks occur because the shark confused a surfer with prey. Visibility is low in cloudy water, making it more likely a shark will confuse you with a seal and attack.Water can be especially murky following storms or heavy rainfall. Rain can also stir up baitfish and attract sharks., Some sharks, especially adult great whites, tend to avoid kelp forests., Again, it's highly unlikely you will ever see a shark, but some experts believe that some sharks migrate closer to land during October, possibly to give birth.So, if you're really anxious about having a run-in with a shark, maybe wait until November to break out the wetsuit.

"
"
Surf with friends.,
Avoid looking like prey.,
Don't enter the water with any cuts or open wounds.",How to Avoid Sharks While Surfing2," Instead of surfing alone, surf with a buddy or a group of people. Sharks target individuals and are less likely to approach a group..


Surfing with a friend increases the chances of your survival, in the unlikely even a shark attack occurs. Most shark attack fatalities are due to not getting help fast enough. A friend who can get you out of the water and notify the lifeguard could save your life., Sharks can't see colors, but they can see contrast (like a black and white swimming suit).Shiny objects may catch the light and resemble fish scales. Remove all jewelry before entering the water and stick to wetsuits and swimsuits in solid, bland colors.Yellow, orange, white, and flesh-colored suits should be avoided.If you have a high-contrast tan (areas of your exposed skin are very dark, while other areas are very white), wear a suit that covers those white areas, so you appear uniform in color., If you get injured while surfing and start to bleed, get out of the water. A little blood in the water can attract sharks from up to 1/3 of a mile away.Some experts also recommend women take a break from surfing during menstruation. Though it is unlikely sharks associate the blood discharged during menstruation with feeding, the other fluids in the discharge may arouse a shark's curiosity"
"
Remain calm.,
Get out of the water.,
Try to use your surfboard as a buffer.,
Defend yourself aggressively.,
Get out of the water and seek immediate medical attention if attacked.",How to Avoid Sharks While Surfing3," Sharks are attracted thrashing--they equate those movements with wounded prety--and can sense fear, both of which can send them into attack mode.Try to keep your wits about you so you can make smart decisions and prepare to defend yourself.

, If the shark is nearby and hasn't attacked, move toward shore as swiftly and quietly as you can, using smooth, rhythmic strokes.Try to keep the shark in your sights at all times.If you notice the shark is displaying aggressive behavior (erratic movements, a hunched back, or quick turns), move as quickly as possible to a rock, nearby kelp canopy, or shore., Get it between you body and the shark and use it as a shield, protecting your front and sides.The surfboard's buoyancy can prevent a shark from dragging you deep under the water, should it attack.

, If the shark does attack, don't play dead. Use your surfboard as a weapon. Try to avoid using your hands if possible, since you may injure them on the shark's teeth. Aim your blows at the shark's eyes, gills, or nose., Your life depends on swift medical attention. Scream for help, send a friend to get the lifeguard and call 911, do whatever it takes to make sure help is on the way as soon as possible."

Find a good spot for bodysurfing.,
Watch the waves.,
Wait for the perfect wave.,
Spin and paddle hard.,
Ride the wave.,
Get up when you can.,
Don't bodysurf alone.,
Always follow surf etiquette.,
Watch and ask for help.",How to Bodysurf," Look for local beaches that don't get very crowded: you'll need a bit of space to properly bodysurf, and you don't want to worry about knocking over any unsuspecting beachgoers. Choose a soft, sandy beach with a gradual slope. Avoid jagged rocks, tide pools, and shallow swaths of seaweed. Begin bodysurfing on a day when the waves are substantial enough to propel you along (1-3 feet) but not so large that they drag you under.As you improve, you might learn to bodysurf confidently in more dangerous conditions. Start with small waves and sandy bottoms until you get the motions down. If a swell drags you along a rocky bottom, you might be seriously injured.
Check waves online. Run a web search for ""swells at "" or ""surf conditions "". Visit Surfline.com, Surf-forecast.com, or another site.;
, Get out into the water and watch where the waves break. The best time to catch a wave is right before it begins to crest (crash.) Wade out into the water and get into position so that you are prepared to catch the waves right where they crest. Gauge the height and the power of the surf, and make sure that you're confident surfing here.


You should be facing away from shore while you're watching the swells. When the time comes to catch a wave, you'll spin to face the shore so that you can ride the surge in.
Make sure that there are no rocks or other obstacles in the way of your ride – above or below the water.

, Most of the waves that come your way will not be ideal for bodysurfing. Get used to diving under or floating over the waves that come. The most graceful way is usually to dive deep into the space beneath the crest of the oncoming wave. This way, you will pass through the wave without taking any of its force.If the waves are small enough, you can just jump over the crests or let them knock you around a bit. Try to take the opportunity to practice ""diving deep"" into the waves.
If you don't dodge the bad ones correctly, you'll get rolled by waves faster than you'd think. If you take a pounding from the waves: get into the ""safe zone,"" which is the area further out to sea beyond where the waves are breaking. Alternately, simply swim to shore and get out of the water to take a break., When you see a wave that you like, spin around to face the shore so that the wave is coming at your back. Start swimming as hard as you can. Time it so that you start paddling just before the wave reaches you. You want to be moving about as fast as the wave in order to stay above the water and ensure a good ride.Use a freestyle or crawl stroke for maximum speed here. Use your arms to generate some forward motion and establish a bit of control in the water., Keep paddling hard as you feel the water swell around you, pick you up, and carry your forward. Steer with your arms and kick with your feet. Pump your feet as quickly and powerfully as you can to keep up your momentum. If you are swimming fast enough, then you should wind up on top of the wave. Let it carry you to shore.


Consider the ""Superman"" pose. Keep your body rigid with your arms held straight out in front of you. This can be a good way to pick up speed, although you won't be able to steer. Many beginning bodysurfers get dragged under and tumbled while trying this move.Keep kicking and paddling to ride the wave for as long as possible. After the crest, the wave will gradually peter out until it cannot maintain the force to carry you any further. If you are swimming hard, you can prolong your ride.

, The wave will carry you until there is insufficient force to sweep you along. If you're bodysurfing on a beach with a gradual, sandy slope, then you may find yourself laying belly-down in the shallows of the shore. As the wave slows down, you should be able to exercise a bit more control over your direction. Stand up and get out of the way of the next wave!

, Ride waves with certified lifeguards around, especially when you are first learning. Bodysurf with a friend or family member, whenever possible, so that you have someone looking out for you if anything goes wrong., Scan your surroundings before you try to catch a wave. Make sure that there's no one in your way, and that you aren't in anyone else's way. If someone else is already riding a wave, then it's up to you to get out of the way. Don't try to ""drop in"" on anybody. This applies to board surfing as well as bodysurfing.To get out of the way of someone who's already surfing: paddle hard in a direction perpendicular to the person's path. Dive deep under the water if you can't get out of the way in time., Go bodysurfing with a friend or family member who already knows how. Don't be too proud to ask for help! If you don't want to ask, then you can at least watch other people catch waves. Keep an eye on their form and their timing. Try to copy their motions until you get it right.


Watch videos of people bodysurfing.Search the Internet for bodysurfing videos to get a feel for the process of catching a wave.

Decide what you'll wear.,
Know the temperature.,
Choose comfortable fins.",How to Body Surf1," You'll want to visit a surf shop if you don't already own adequate gear. Planning ahead can save you time and money, and can help prevent injuries.


Choose comfortable swimwear. Some experts recommend wearing swimwear with minimal drag, like brief-cut swimming trunks, to cut down on the resistance your body will have in the water.The less resistance your body has, the faster and smoother your body will cut through the water. But water resistance isn't the only factor to consider.;
, Unlike a typical outdoor outing, where the air temperature is the most important factor, body surfers need to take the water temperature into account. For this reason, you may want to wear a wetsuit to stay warm when the water is cold.


Choose the right wetsuit for your environment. There are many cuts and styles of wetsuits available, and where and when you will be body surfing will determine what kind of swim wear you'll need. The most important factors to consider are the thickness of the suit and the sleeve/leg length. These vary from short sleeves and legs, three-quarter length sleeves and legs, and full-length suits. , Unlike traditional surfing, which uses a floatation device like a surfboard, body surfing uses only the surfer's body to ride waves. But that doesn't mean you have to navigate the waters without any assistance. Many body surfers wear fins that strap to the feet to help cut through water faster and ride waves more efficiently.


Find the right fit. Try on different pairs by different brands to find the pair that fits you best. You don't want fins that are too big or too tight. It may be helpful to think of fins as a natural appendage. They should move with you comfortably and help you swim more fluidly, rather than hinder you. "

Set up a training routine.,
Practice a variety of strokes.,
Try closed-fist swimming.,
Use a kickboard to practice.",How to Build Your Stamina for Swimming1," Set up a training schedule that allows you to practice and improve every day. Commit to swimming at a certain time each week so you get into a habit and your muscles won't weaken in-between lapses.


Swim often, at least 2-3 times a week. Vary your swimming sessions with cross-training sessions in between so you have a chance to strengthen other muscles, too.;
, Don't just practice freestyle the entire time: incorporate many kinds of strokes into your sets. Different strokes work different muscles, and your endurance is only as strong as your weakest muscles.


If you're new to swimming, practice a stroke for three or four laps (or until you've got the hang of it). Some great strokes to start with are: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and and the butterfly stroke.

Slowly increase the amount of time you spend on a certain stroke. Try to hold a certain stroke for 1-2 minutes longer each time until you build greater endurance.

, When you want to focus on strength, make a fist with your hand instead of cupping it or holding it out flat while you swim. The momentum your hands make will diminish, and your arms will have to work more to stay afloat. This will strengthen your forearms and increase your workout threshold.Do closed-fist swimming at the beginning of your workout rather than the end. Swimming with fists is tiring, and you may be too fatigued if you save it for your last sets.

, If you have a powerful kick, you'll greatly increase your swimming strength. Swim with your kickboard for a set number of laps so you can focus entirely on increasing leg endurance. Practice different kinds of kicks like butterfly kicks, back kicks, and side kicks.Plan to use a kickboard near the end of your workout, when your arms will be more tired and need rest.

Find the right beach.,
Read surf reports.,
Check for environmental hazards.",How to Body Surf2," Surfing of any kind requires a beach that has a noticeable surf break. This means that the water breaks, forming a surfable wave.


Choose the right waves. For beginners, it's best to start out small. Choose a beach with waves that are less than four feet high, and look for surf locations with gentle slopes. Know your breaks. Breaks are caused by a variety of factors, typically because of some underwater landscape change that causes the surface to rise up. While big waves can offer ideal opportunities for surfing, shore breaks can also create dangerous situations. Know the beach you plan to surf at and understand the potential hazards. , These reports, which are easily found online, can tell you vital information, such as wave heights and weather forecasts. Check the local weather listing and read updates from the coast guard, as well as from other surfers.

, If there is increased shark activity at a certain beach, you'll want to know about it in advance. Likewise if a storm has brought in new, potentially hazardous wood or rocks underwater. Doing research at home can save you from learning the hard way about a potentially dangerous situation.


Ask an expert. If you're unsure whether a beach is safe, and the online surf reports aren't up to date, call or email the lifeguard association in that region. They'll know which beaches have hazards like rip currents or shark sightings, and they may be able to recommend a safer alternative than the beach you're planning on surfing.

Wade out into chest-deep water.,
Practice your form.,
Streamline your body.,
Know when and how to escape the wave.",How to Body Surf3," Wait for the right wave to come your way.

, While paddling toward land, let the wave meet your body.


Once you're riding the wave, stop paddling your arms, but keep your legs moving.
If you want to simply ride to shore, stretch your arms out in front of you and let the wave carry you toward the beach.
If you want to ride with the wave, keep one arm out in front and use your other arm behind you to control your body. Your arms should work together, the front arm to ""aim"" your body and the back arm to keep it from arching out of control. Having that hand out front will also protect your head from potentially hitting the sand. , At this point you should be riding the wave, either with it or against it, working your way toward shore. Keep your body rigid if you want to go faster, but don't go too fast without learning the basics first.

, If you feel yourself moving out of control, you'll want to leave the wave as quickly and safely as possible. Leveling out or tucking and rolling out the back of the wave are the easiest ways to escape and swim to shore.

Make sure you have a dog surfboard.,
Many surf dog contest are on budgets and usually use old donor boards which is not really all that good for you or the dog.,
Start small.,
Demonstrate by example and get your dog excited about being in the water with you surfboard to get him fired up to join you.,
Get your dog used to the board on the sand or on another suitable surface before going into the water.,
Pop on your dog's pet (personal) flotation device (PFD).,
Paddle out.,
Catch the wave.",How to Teach Your Dog to Surf," Your dog's paws can be harmed if he is not using the right board. Foam boards are bad for dogs as it tears their skin after a few uses. Your dog may chew on a foam board, and foam boards have no traction, so they use wax, which is terrible for a dog's paws as sand and debris get in the webs of your dog's paws and could be harmful. Make sure you get a ""dog surfboard"". The hard surface dog surfboards are great and come with many safety features such as a standard ocean rescue safety release handle on the tail for choosing the right waves or hanging on for the ride. They also come with Soft Traction throughout the board, which provides not just traction but also serves as a cushion in case of a wipe out! The hard Dog Surfboards, are great because you can design your own colors, logo's, pics of dog or any artwork you can think of! They are totally customized for your dog, which you can't get with any soft board. Harder top boards float much better and do not fold or bend nor crease. Soft boards  are a little less stable and slippery which causes the dog to move forward on the board thus causing the surfboard to nose dive.;
, Ask your local surf shop for a ""Dog Surfboard"" not a giant foam board, a real authentic Dog Surfboard, or Google Dog Surfboards, and Dog Wetsuits, something will pop up!


Get your dog some gear too. Suitable items include a dog life vest, dog wetsuits, dog beach towels, water and salt waterproof bungee leashes, pet tent (for a rest in while you keep surfing), and Travel Pet Bed for the beach!

, Begin somewhere easy, like a swimming pool or a lake on a really flat wave day. Throw your dog's favorite fetch toy into the water and see if he retrieves it. If he does, he is probably a water-loving dog. Having other dogs that like the water will also encourage your dog into the water.


Make sure you know how to surf. It won't make much sense to your dog if you're not sharing the experience and know what to do too!
This sport involves a lot of exertion in the water, and the waves can be rough, so be sure that you and your dog are both strong swimmers before attempting to surf.

, Talk to him, call to him, and encourage him to come into the water and play nearby while watching what you're doing.


Play with your dog in the water.
Let your dog play on the board.

Develop your dog's trust (the number one element for success); don't start off too fast and make sure that it is fun for your dog.

, Test your dog's balance to see where he likes to place himself on the board. Some smaller dogs like the nose of the board, some heavier dogs have a better center of gravity and like the middle to the back of the board. Depending on size, however, your dog should be roughly about two-thirds of the way back, with his tail over the board's fin.


If your dog is too far forward, the board will nosedive under the wave, unless you use a hard top dog surfboard with traction such as ""Scrappy"" below in the picture.
If your dog is too far back, the nose will come out of the water and the board won't catch the wave.

, The dog PFD will provide your dog with greater flotation when he wipes out in the surf. Many dog life vests have a handle on top that lets you gently pull your canine pal back on the board or out of the water when needed.

, On a longboard, get on the board with the dog and paddle into the waves. You should be behind the dog for best results when paddling through the breakers. On a shortboard or boogie board, put the dog on the board and push him out through the breakers.

, Start with small waves, roughly 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) (30cm - 60cm). Even champion surfing dogs don't tackle surf much bigger than 3–4 feet (0.91–1.2 m) (90cm - 120cm).

Push off and shred. Catching the wave is a knack that requires timing, finesse, patience and lots of repetition.
Get your dog started in the wave each time and then let him surf the wave on his own. Try to get the dog started right when the waves starts to curl.






Now your dog and you are surfing! Bow Wow Bunga, dude!

Practice swimming drills.,
Vary the pace of your laps.,
Work on your stroke body position.,
Time yourself.,
Swim in a line.",How to Build Your Stamina for Swimming2," Drills are practices that are designed to help you strengthen your technique. The better your stroke techniques, the faster you will be able to swim. Practice one or two drills at the beginning of your swim practice each day.


The hand-drag drill increases hand-recovery speed. Swim a stroke as you normally would, but drag your hand through the water during the recovery phase. When you swim normally again, your hands will perform the drill much more swiftly.Try dolphin kicks for a swifter momentum. To practice dolphin kicks, kick your right and left leg at the same time, as if they were a dolphin fin., To increase your energy and gain control over your speed, change your pace for every lap. Swim some laps at a leisurely pace, some at a moderate pace, and some at a racing level.


For best results, don't just perform your laps from slowest to fastest. Mix up your laps with fast laps in-between slow or moderate ones so you have time to catch your breath.

, Poor swimming form can greatly limit your swimming speed due to excessive drag.Study the correct position for each stroke and do your best to stay in correct form.

, Most swimming pools have a pace watch, a small instrument with a minute and second hand that divides time into 5 second increments, from 5-60 seconds or minutes.Try to perform a certain lap or drill within a specific time frame, shortening the time limit as your speed improves.


If your swimming pool does not have a pace clock, consider buying a waterproof stopwatch or your own small pacer clock.

, Part of strengthening your speed is increasing your efficiency. Try your best to keep your body in a straight line. Don't let you arms or legs cross their lines: for example, your left arm should never move into the right lane.


Practice the single arm drill if you have trouble with swimming straight. Perform a stroke with just one arm per lap. Hold onto your kickboard with the other arm if you have trouble staying afloat.
If you are performing a backstroke, use your eyes. Focus your sight on something straight ahead, like a diving board or a chair directly ahead of you. This will help you swim in a steady line.

Plan to cross-train 3-4 days a week.,
Eat enough protein and carbohydrates on your training days.,
Try aerobic exercises.,
Try anaerobic exercises.,
Add strength training to your weekly schedule.,
Rest to maintain balance.",How to Build Your Stamina for Swimming3," Stamina requires balance, and cross-training will help you gain this. Swim 2-3 days a week, then exercise in other ways for the rest of the week.


Choose exercise activities that you love. Tailor your exercises to activities that you enjoy so you will want to try harder. Increasing your stamina will be much easier if you love what you do.
Long-distance running is an especially helpful cross-training sport for swimmers because of it builds endurance and cardiovascular health.

, Carbs will provide energy to burn during practices, and protein will help you gain more muscle. Eat a meal at least 2-4 hours before swimming or a snack at least 30 minutes before to avoid cramps.Bring food with simple carbs (like pretzels, honey, or fruit) to eat directly after your workout. This will help you replenish your energy and raise your blood sugar.
For protein, go for quality over quantity. Instead of protein shakes and red meat, go for a diet with lots of whole eggs, milk, fish, and soybeans.

, Aerobic training works your cardiovascular system and strengthens the muscles pumping blood to your heart.Plan on including 1-2 aerobic cross-training exercises a week. Examples of aerobic exercises include running, cycling, kickboxing, and hiking.


Swimming is an aerobic exercise, so if you're short on aerobic cross-training one week, count your swim practices as aerobic days., Anaerobic training involves intense workouts that improve strength and build your overall muscle mass.Having more muscle will help you during endurance swimming exercises, so try to include 1-2 anaerobic cross-training exercises a week. Examples of anaerobic exercises include squatting, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT).


For a balanced workout schedule, include a balance of aerobic and anaerobic cross-training days. Both have different benefits and can help you strengthen separate parts of the body., Weight training increases your muscle endurance and will allow you to use oxygen more efficiently when you swim. If you weight train, you will be able to to gradually build stamina in the muscles you focus on.Spend time using free weights, machines, or performing strength-training exercises once or twice a week.

, Work one day of rest into your schedule each week so your body has time to recover. If you train every day, your overall intensity will decrease over time due to exhaustion. Moderation is important in everything, even stamina training.


On rest days, go on a walk, leisurely bike ride, or yoga class.
Get plenty of rest the night before your workouts. Aim for between 7 and 8 hours of sleep a night.

Insert your dominant hand (right if you are right handed, left if you are left handed) into the adjustable hand strap.,
Wade out to waist deep water, facing the horizon.

,
Lower yourself into the water and put your hand with the handboard outstretched in front of you.,
Once you are in position where the waves are breaking, turn around and face the shore, while keeping your attention on the approaching waves.,
Position the arm with the handplane outstretched in front of you.

,
As the wave rolls towards you, kick hard and use your free arm in a freestyle swim stoke for that extra push.,
Pick right or left, depending on which way the wave is breaking and you will get a much longer pitted ride.,
At this point you've picked your line, and now it’s the point of no return so don't hesitate.,
Angle your handboard across face of the wave to allow for longer surfing time.",How to Bodysurf Using a Handplane,"


Ensure that your palm is facing down and flat and that the strap fits snug (essentially giving your handboard a high five).;
,, Take the other hand and place over the hand in the strap. With your body outstretched, kick and you will move forward quickly out past the breaking waves.

, Getting out to the break is a lot easier with a handplane. By placing the board out in front of you and kicking, the board keeps you buoyant and the kicking moves you forward. As the wave comes toward you, simply kick forward under the water and the wave with flow over you.

,, Once you get used to it you will find you will use the freestyle stroke less and less as you learn to judge the waves better.


The secret to this part is timing. Too fast and you are out in front of the wave. Too slow and the wave rolls over you.

, The forward momentum of the wave will pick you up and carry you with it.

, Go for it! Stop stroking. Streamline your body and keep kicking down to a minimum. Become a human surfboard. Your fins are now your rudder and the board is the bow of your ship.

,


At this point there are various options for the free arm. Leave it out to hang free, or bring it over to lay on top of the hand in the strap.

Get help from a friend.,
Take swimming lessons.,
Get a “feel” for the water.,
Blow bubbles.,
Practice floating.,
Tread water.,
Practice kicking.,
Learn other strokes.",How to Be a Good Swimmer1," Having a friend in the water with you is comforting. They can remind you what you need to be doing. They can hold you in specific positions while you get a feel for them.;
, Whether you are a child or an adult, there is a swim class out there for you. Being around people who are there to teach you will ease any tension or apprehension you might feel. Having a weekly “date” at the pool will help you be accountable to the learning process.

, Learning how your body moves and feels in the water is very important. It’s something we’re not used to, but once you get comfortable, water can be very comfortable and soothing.


Start off in the shallow end and begin to move your hands and arms around.
Push your hands against the water to feel the resistance. Cup your hands and pull them through the water (sculling). That pressure you feel is what is going to eventually help propel you through the water effortlessly.
Bend your legs and let the water come up to your chin. Continue to move your hands and arms. Even when you are beginning to learn strokes, start each session like this.

, The most important (and scariest) part of swimming is learning how to breathe. But once you learn how to exhale into the water, you will be on your way to more efficient and graceful swimming.


Reach forward and hold onto the edge of the pool in the shallow end.
Put your face in the water and blow out. When you are done, turn your head to the side and take a breath.
Push your face back into the water and exhale. Try to create a long, steady stream of bubbles.
Repeat until you are comfortable. Exhaling into the water and timing your breathing might be frightening at first, but with practice you’ll soon be ready to learn some basic strokes.

, It sounds obvious, but floating is a tough skill to learn, and harder to master. In an emergency, knowing how to float can save precious energy and possibly your life. Spend time working on your body position. Learn to float on your stomach and your back.


Relax. You have to relax.While learning how to float on your back, look at the sky or the ceiling and breathe deeply. Fill your lungs with air with each breath. Hold your breath for a moment and let the experience of being weightless atop the water calm you.
Reach up with your arms if your legs sink. This will act as a counterbalance, bringing your legs up.
Have a friend help. Having someone next to you to place a reassuring hand at the small of your back can ease your tension immeasurably.
Tighten your abdominal muscles. Engaging your abdominal muscles will help you keep your appendages afloat easier.
Float on your stomach. Let your arms go limp and free. Raise your head or tilt it to the side when you need a breath.

, Treading water can help you catch your breath and keep your head up without actually swimming.Practice this in the deep end with a friend.


Move your legs in an “eggbeater” fashion. Start with your knees bend and your legs slightly wider than hip-width apart. Then pedal your legs in opposite directions. Let your kicks be relaxed and easy.
Cup your hands and circle them in medium-sized (about two feet total) infinity signs. If you need to come up further, kick harder with your legs and arms to propel yourself above the rip of the water.

, This is a great way to separate the parts of the strokes before you put them all together.


Hold on to the side of the pool. Put your face down and extend your body straight out.
Turn your feet in slightly. Begin small kicks. Try to keep them small and efficient, rarely breaking the surface of the water. Your legs should bend, but only slightly.This is a flutter kick.
Practice a front stroke. This is also known as freestyle. Bring one arm out of the water so that it is reaching forward. Place it back into the water with a slightly cupped hand, then pull your arm through the water. As your pull the water down, your stroke will naturally end at your hip. Alternate arms.

, As your skills grow, watch other people and emulate what they do. Most of all, have fun in the water and let its resistance turn you into a stronger, more graceful swimmer.

Participate in local swim meets.",How to Be a Good Swimmer2," Join a gym that has a lap pool (25 yards/meters at least). Swimming throughout the year will increase your strength, endurance, and stamina. It will also keep you in contact with fellow year-rounders who can support your efforts.

, When you don’t have anyone to talk with at the pool, swimming can feel like a chore, and a lonely one at that. Going to work out with other swimmers might score you free training advice for free.At the very least, you’ll make friends who share your desire to become a better swimmer. This will lead to a sense of accountability, something that really helps when dragging yourself out of bed at five in the morning.

, Both are great opportunities for all swimmers to get technique help on each swimming stroke. They are also great ways to meet fellow swimmers who will help bolster your goal to become a better swimmer.

, There are four basic strokes (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle) and you should try to learn them all. While you’ll always have a favorite, being a well-rounded swimmer will help to keep swimming challenging an interesting.


When you swim all strokes, your use more muscles. Your body will also get a much better workout. You’ll see and feel the results faster when you utilize all four strokes.
The risk of injury while swimming is decreased because you aren’t always stressing the same muscles with the same movements. The musculature is more balanced.The skills you learn from one stroke transfers into skills into a different stroke. For example, the underwater undulation you employ when kicking off the wall into breaststroke is transferable to the underwater undulation you’ll use when starting in backstroke.

, Adding flip turns eliminates the stop-and-start rests at the end of each lap. You’ll become a better distance swimmer when employing these maneuvers. You’ll also save energy when you push off the wall, propelling yourself into a good position to begin your stroke. It’s also a great way to see where your opponents are.


Exercising your core while you learn will help you accomplish the technical aspects of a flip-turn. They require a full somersault, a trunk flexion, and rapid trunk extension.-
Keep your chin down when using a flipturn in freestyle. Begin the turn about an arm’s length from the wall. You’ll begin to do a somersault or a “flip.” Your chin should come close to your chest. Your knees should come close to your chest as well. Plant your feet against the wall and twist your torso. Put your hands together and streamline your body as you push away from the wall.
When you’re doing a flipturn in backstroke. About one yard or meter from the wall, turn around to the front by reaching around with your leading arm. Look around with your head so your body will naturally follow. Keep the leading arm extended ahead and flip. Push off from the wall.

, Check online to see what’s available. Look for instruction that is above your level. Challenge yourself!

, Drills will help you pay attention to the clock and your times. They allow you to take what you’ve been working on (like your strokes) and immediately apply it to your regular swimming habits.


Play “catch-up” while you swim freestyle. Catch up drills are a classic way of improving your freestyle stroke. Their goal is to smooth out and lengthen your stroke by making you pay attention to your strokes. You keep one arm out in front of you the entire time you swim, and wait until the arm taking a stroke “catches up” with the other one.
For more interesting swimming drills, ask other swimmers, or go online. There are plenty of fun suggestions to keep your workout interesting.
Challenge yourself by setting a yardage goal to complete each week. A good start is 2000 yards or meters a workout (forty lengths).Your goal is to become a better swimmer and nothing betters swimming like more swimming.

, Keeping an eye on the clock will help you ascertain how efficient your are in the water. If you are doing sets, make sure they are timed (ie four fifties on the minute with ten seconds break between the next round).

, With an increase in distance and speed, your technique will improve dramatically. Set new goals as you leave old ones behind!

, Through the swimming community, there are plenty of opportunities to compete in swim meets, even as an adult. A competition is a way to boost your swimming by providing a new, determined, focus.

Get a coach.,
Record yourself.,
Find balance between your long stroke and your short stroke.,
Search for long distance swims in your area.",How to Be a Good Swimmer3," Having someone monitoring your strokes, your breathing, and your technique is a great way to get a new perspective on how you approach your swim style. A good coach standing on the pool deck working with a group of swimmers is the best way to improve your overall swimming performance.If you can’t find a coach, have a swimming buddy whose technique you admire watch your workout.

, Aside from a coach, recording yourself is a great way to get perspective on how you move through the water. You’ll see bad habits you might not have been aware of as well as strengths you can improve upon.

, A long stroke is great; you’re using good propulsion, low drag, and glide. A short stroke is great, too, but you can waste energy on strokes that are too short and scrappy.Know your stroke rate. It’s a powerful aspect to know because it will allow you to make needed changes to your strokes to improve your style.
Ask a friend or coach to time you for ten strokes with a stopwatch, not including dives or push-offs, just regular swimming. Count the number of strokes you take in the ten seconds. This is your stroke rate. Adjust your stroke as needed.

, A long distance event is any distance-based swimming event more than 1650 yards or 1508.8 meters. It can also be any time based even equal to or greater than one hour and can be in a pool or any body of water.


Long distance swims are a great way to focus your expertise in your training for an fun event. Sign up with friends and make a weekend getaway out of it!

Get comfortable goggles.,
Buy a swim cap.,
Buy flippers.,
Buy a proper suit.,
Buy pull buoys and kickboards.",How to Be a Good Swimmer4," They will protect your eyes from the sting of chlorine. Once you get used to them, you’ll discover a whole new way of looking at the world.


Buy a pair that does not pinch at the nose. Good goggles should be snug but not pinch.
Push them against your face. If they stick around your eyes, that is a good sign they will not leak when you are in the water.

, It will protect your hair against chlorine damage and will keep your hair out of your face while you are swimming. Most importantly, swim caps make you more hydrodynamic in the water.


Latex caps are protect well against chlorine but are difficult to put on and remove. Putting a bit of talcum powder in the cap before you put it on and while it’s dry helps. Don’t use if you have a latex allergy.
Silicone swim caps are the most popular although they are a bit more expensive. They are commonly used by people with medium to long hair. They protect hair well against the water and are still flexible enough to put on and take off.They do, however, slip off your head more easily..
Lycra swim caps are more comfortable and more durable than silicone or latex. They are not waterproof, however, and tend to slip the most while swimming.
Neoprene swim caps are great for keeping your head warm in cold water. They are thicker, have seams, and often have a certain smell. They are great, however, if you are swimming outdoors in rivers, lakes, or reservoirs.

, Using flippers will improve a swimmer’s body position and their technique.Most importantly, they can be used to strengthen your kick to better propel yourself through the water. This propulsion will allow you time to focus on your stroke technique.


Using flippers will give you a sense of cutting quickly through the water. Remember this feeling and try to emulate it when you take the fins off.
Kicking efficiently is highlighted using flippers, especially if you have a cross-over kick. They will force you to keep your feet a proper distance. They will also help increase your ankle flexibilityby streamlining the position of your feet.

, This is the number one sign of commitment to swimming. Gone are the bikinis and frills; what’s left is consistent and streamlined. It’s best to think about your goals. Will you be logging long daily pool yardage or just a couple of times a week?


Buy a polyester blend if you’ll be spending lots of time in the water. If cared for properly, they can last for years.
Buy lycra swimwear if you won’t be in the pool daily. It’s soft, comfortable, and is known for its expansive stretchiness. Keep in mind though, that no material is impervious to chlorine so always pay attention to the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Both of these are designed to isolate your arms or your legs to better strengthen your techniques. While they are not strictly necessary (you can achieve the same effect by holding your hands together and focusing only on your kicks, or by tucking your feet together and only focusing on your strokes), they are wonderful at supporting your arms and legs as you move through the water.


Pull buoys and kickboards are a great resource to have if you have an injury. You can keep up with your workouts and rest the part of your body that is injured at the same time.

Focus on the muscle endurance needed for swimming.,
Use the weight room.,
Utilize rubber bands.,
Run, bike, row, dance, use the elliptical or the stair machine.",How to Be a Good Swimmer5," Back muscles, biceps, shoulders, triceps for upper body workouts that will build endurance with strength should be highlighted. However, high rep endurance is needed for the legs. Combining a maximum repetition of pullups and resting with flutter kicks can improve endurance.

, Bent-over rows and bicep curls, and isolating triceps, abdominals, and the lower back are all great exercise for your swimming muscles.


They should be done with moderate weight and high reps (15-20 per set).

, Secure them to a tree or a door knob. Let the natural resistance work you out the same way water works.


Make sure you secure the band to something really stable. A sudden jolt from something breaking can lead to injury.

, Involving yourself with cardiovascular activities will always help your general health, and actively keeping fit will help your body stay ready for when you hit the water again.

Focus on your stroke count.",How to Be an Excellent Swimmer1," Some skills require repetition to get just right, but in swimming, it does no good to swim dozens of laps if you are not using proper technique. Your practice should focus on perfecting your stroke technique rather than on swimming the most and fastest laps possible.Swimming slow makes it easier to notice what part of your stroke needs work. Swimming fast may make it seem like your stroke is fine even if it isn’t.
It is also easier to perfect your technique without worrying about making the fastest times.
Faster speeds will come with improved technique, but you can’t improve technique by swimming faster.;
, You may think that the best swimmers are constantly transitioning from stroking with one arm to stroking with the next, but it is actually better to glide for about a second in between strokes. Gliding helps you transition by giving you time to ready your other arm.


The best way to glide is to let your stroke arm remain extended briefly, for about 1 second, before you pull it through the water to your side.
While you glide, you should continue to kick from the hips as you do during a stroke.
During the glide, you should exhale under the water slowly.

, Because swimming is continuous, having exceptional breathing is important. A good technique is to exhale, under the water, on every third stroke. This allows you rotate which side of your body you exhale toward. Constantly gasping for breath will distract you and slow you down.When you exhale underwater, your eyes should be focused on a point at the bottom of the pool. Keeping your eyes straight down helps keep your head in one place. Plus, exhaling underwater makes it so you only need to inhale when your mouth is above the water.
Learn to inhale in the trough, or pocket, made by each stroke. This pocket is made by the top of your head as it moves through the water. It’s near your face, and it allows you to breathe without having to turn your head so much.
If a stroke takes 1 second, then you glide for 1 second, and you inhale on the third stroke, then you’ll inhale about every 4 seconds, and exhale during those 4 seconds in between.

, Being in control of the speed of your stroke ensures efficiency. When you begin to fatigue or you lose concentration, your stroke count can lose it’s measured rhythm. If you speed up, you want it to be a conscious choice you made.A good place to start is determining what your natural stroke rate is. Have a friend or teammate time you for two minutes and count how many strokes you take. See what your average rate is for 1 minute.
This number will tell you if your strokes are longer or shorter than they should be. If you notice your stroke count is high, but your speed isn’t what you want, your strokes may not be as efficient as they could be. If your count is low, you may be going through the stroke too slowly.
Practicing at different speeds will help you find the perfect stroke rate that is efficient and easy to maintain throughout a race.

Learn all four competitive strokes.,
Develop a consistent practice routine.,
Join a team or club.,
Take swim lessons.,
Set specific training goals.",How to Be an Excellent Swimmer2," The four competitive strokes are freestyle (which is most commonly the crawl stroke), backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Learning the proper techniques for all four, and then perfecting those techniques, will make you a well-rounded swimmer.From lessons, a coach, or by watching videos, you can pick up the proper arm movements for the stroke, as well as how and when the best way to kick is.
You may do best to focus on one stroke at a time rather than attempting to learn all four of them. See what you can carry over from one stroke to the others.

, You should not decide how to workout every time you head to the pool. Come up with a full workout that you can follow each time, or even 2-3 workouts so you don’t get bored of the exact same thing. A plan for your workout will help you push yourself and have a specific end point.Your routine should always start with some good dynamic stretching of the arms, legs, neck and back. It is important to get the muscles loose and warmed up before getting in the water.
Next you should do some in-water warm-ups. Swim a handful of sets at a casual pace, but with great technique, to get the muscles ready for the harder portion of the workout. Replenish your fluids after this part.
The rest of the workout should be some drills followed by your main set in which you push yourself hard. Drills might be 5-10 75m laps with short pauses for rest in between. Your main part should focus on speed and endurance for whatever events you are training for.

, Training all the time by yourself can become a burden, and you miss out on the coaching and competition of teammates when you train alone. Being part of a team offers the companionship that makes training more fun, plus having other swimmers around pushes you to get faster.Depending on your situation, this may take a little researching to find out what you have available near you. Many high schools and colleges have teams that you could join, or at the very least practice with.
If you are not in school, inquire at the pool you typically swim at about whether or not they have any swim clubs, or even casual groups of swimmers who meet to practice together.
At the very least, if you can’t find an organized group to join, consider asking any swimmers you meet at the pool if they would be interesting in joining you in a consistent training routine. Two or three people helping each other out is still better than going at it alone.

, Even if you have been swimming for a long time, or have even competed, swim lessons with a trained mentor could improve your swimming. They can watch you and point out areas of weakness that you can’t see on your own. Plus, they can instruct you on the best techniques that you may not know.


If you have been swimming for a long time, but have not been under a coach or mentor recently, you may have developed bad habits that you didn’t even notice. Lessons can help you find out those flaws and remove them.
Lessons can be a good way to “force” yourself to get in the pool frequently and towards a specific purpose. Plus, your training sessions will have focus because you’ll have a guide.
Lessons may cost you some money, but this will give you a feeling of being invested in your training more than if there is no sacrifice.

, Your goals could include practicing 4 days a week, swimming a lap in under a minute, or swimming 10 laps without a break. You can have a coach or teammates help you set the goals and be accountable, but you should ultimately be making them for yourself. Be realistic about your current skill level when setting goals.For example, “I want to swim faster,” is a broad goal that doesn’t have a concrete point of achievement. “I want to hit 30 seconds in the 50 meter” gives you a target to aim for.
If you don't know what good goals would be, you could track how you perform during a week of practice and then set your goals based on that. If you find out you can easily swim 10 laps, your goal might be to swim 15.

"
"
Practice positive self-talk.,
Live on a consistent schedule.,
Push yourself a little harder than you want to.,
Gather a support system.",How to Be an Excellent Swimmer3," What you consistently tell yourself has a significant impact on your attitude, especially regarding training. Tell yourself that you can achieve your goals, that you want to practice hard, and that you can always improve.Never say to yourself, “I’ll work on it tomorrow.” Putting off your training for another day when you feel like working is never a good habit to develop. Tell yourself, “Today is the day to strive toward my goals.”
Don’t say to yourself, “It’s too late to____,” filling in the blank with “improve,” “fix my bad habits,” or “achieve success.” It’s not too late if you get to work today.
Absolutely never say, “I can’t.” It takes away your willpower, and it is rarely true. What it really means is that you are saying you won’t. Instead, tell yourself, “This may be hard, but I can do it.”

, Excellent swimmers are in control of all aspects of their lives. You need to practice frequently, not just when you want to. You need to eat a planned diet, not whatever and whenever you want. You need to sleep and give your body time to rest and recover from working hard.Although some people go through their days on 3-4 hours of sleep each night, athletes should do their best to get the recommended 8 hours. Going to sleep and waking up at roughly the same times most nights is best for your body, as well.
Swimmers should eat every 3-4 hours. It is best to stay away from processed foods in favor of lean protein, fruits and vegetables, and whole grain breads, pastas, and cereals.
Plan a workout schedule for the whole week and make yourself stick to it. Your body can perform better on a consistent exercise plan.

, When you get to the point where you think you have done enough and you are ready to be done, make a habit of doing just a little more. Once you find your limit, your point of exhaustion, make yourself do one more perfect lap.


Improving means striving to do more than what you can already do. If your faster lap is 30 seconds, push to get down to 25 seconds. If your workout is usually 2 hours, choose a couple days to go an extra half hour.
The goals you have already set are a measure for pushing past your limit. If you have set reasonable goals, but ones that force you to improve, then you have a gauge of how hard you are pushing yourself.
Being good might not be that hard, but being excellent means going further. Anyone can stop once they run out of energy, but it takes real drive to go past that limit.
It is important to pay attention to what your body is telling you. If you are feeling consistently tired, or you notice pain in a certain spot that last multiple days, you may need to take some extra time to rest. You don’t want to overexert yourself.

, In competition, you swim alone, but the rest of the time you need people who are supporting you. Find a friend who can practice with you to keep you accountable. Find a coach or mentor who will push you to be the best you can be. The point is to find people to push you and keep you focused on your goals.


Family can be great support in athletics. Tell your parents, siblings, and grandparents about your passion for improving. Tell them your goals and get them to help you stay focused. Church leaders, heads of organizations, co-workers, and neighbors are also good people to get involved.
A good way to gather these people is to say, “I’m going to be focusing on my swimming a lot more and I would love to have your support. Can you check in with me sometimes to see if I am sticking to my training routines?”
Parents especially can help you eat the right foods and make sure you are getting enough sleep every night.

Keep a tight, straight position.,
Remember to kick.,
Hold your head down and your arms at your sides.,
Spread your fingers.,
Practice bilateral breathing.,
Lengthen and vary your strokes.,
Practice some race-ending hacks.,
Eat healthy.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get enough sleep.,
Talk to your coach.,

Warm up.,
Work on your flexibility.,
Exercise on dry land.,
Practice with a teammate.,
Slow down to cool down.,
End with stretches.",How to Be More Likely to Win a Swimming Race," The initial racing step of streamlining is an important factor in reducing drag. However, when the muscles get tired, swimmers usually try to skimp on keeping that tight, straight position. Make streamlining a mandatory part of your regular training routine. This way, it will become second nature whether you are training or competing. Regular practice will also allow you to improve your technique for a better shot at first place., Whether you’re breaking out or swimming underwater, kicks help to reduce drag. When breaking out, kick forcefully from the wall. This will help you to maintain the speed you gained from the initial push. When you’re underwater, do dolphin kicks by extending your legs straight back, holding your feet together, and moving your legs straight up and down. The longer you can hold the kick, the more velocity you can gain., Your head and arms can reduce the drag on the rest of your body if you know how to position them. When compared to the horizontal alignment of your body, your head should be in a downward position. Keep your arms alongside your body, as opposed to above your head. You can reduce drag significantly by practicing these techniques., Studies show that spreading your fingers just ten degrees can improve your speed by over two percent.To see what a ten-degree spread looks like, hold your right hand up with your palm facing you. Do not stretch your fingers out or squeeze them together. Make sure your pinky is pointing slightly to the left.

, Professional swimmers argue that bilateral breathing is a key factor in endurance. Breathe on every third stroke, as opposed to the more common breath on every second or fourth. Rather than breathing from the same side of your nose each time, alternate which side you breathe on each time., How you move your arms can also affect your endurance. For the complete stroke, reach your arm as far in front of you as you comfortably can. Reach as far behind you as possible in the push phase. Alternating between forward and backward strokes will give certain muscle groups to rest while others work., You will be tired by the end of the race, but that doesn’t mean you have to fall behind. Focus on muscles you haven't used to the point of exhaustion. Experts suggest kicking more vigorously and working your back and shoulders more. Working the less fatigued muscles will shift your focus away from the muscles that are tired., Swimming can burn thousands of calories in a single practice. Ask your doctor to estimate your caloric burn by your age, weight, and height. After that, you need to replace those spent calories through the proper diet. Important nutrients swimmers need include zinc, protein, calcium, and healthy (monounsaturated) fats. Whether you are an omnivore, vegetarian, or vegan, you can get the recommended daily amount. Most of your diet should consist of fresh, whole foods to avoid having to take too many supplements.


Nuts (including peanut butter) and beans are excellent sources of healthy fats, zinc, and protein. Dark leafy greens are packed with calcium.
If you have to eat on the go, pack some granola bars, peanut butter, trail mix, or packable fruit (bananas, citrus, apples, etc.) to stay fueled.
The day before the competition, stick to small but frequent meals, about every two to four hours.Avoid junk foods—anything deep fried, greasy, loaded with sugar, or containing ingredients you can’t pronounce., Believe it or not, you do sweat while swimming.If you don't hydrate before you swim or replace the moisture you lose, you could get dehydrated and experience physical or mental weakness. Regular sips before and after each practice, as well as between intervals, will keep you hydrated. Don't wait until you feel thirsty., Sleep is just as important as physical training for all athletes. Swimmers can improve their sprinting time, reaction time, strokes, and kicks by extending their sleep periods an extra hour or two per night for up to seven weeks before the competition.Go to sleep and wake up at the same times every day—even on weekends and holidays.


If you feel tired during the day, take a nap, but keep it short. Set your alarm to go off 20 to 30 minutes after your head hits the pillow. Use caution, though. Naps should not replace the eight- to ten hours of sleep you need every night., This is especially crucial before you’ve finalized your training plan. Your coach can give you advice about which strokes and events you would do well in. If you are swimming in the meet to get a qualifying time for one of the larger meets, ask your coach what the qualifying times are.

, Figure out one long-term goal first. Then, set weekly or monthly short-term goals that will make your long-term goal easier to achieve. For example, if your long-term goal is to improve your time by the end of the season, you need to set monthly and weekly goals that will improve your speed and endurance., No matter how pressed you are for time, you should never skip the warm-up. Begin by stretching, working each part of your body in the order your coach recommends. If your muscles are cold, take a short brisk walk or go for a brief swim before you stretch. Continue by power walking, jogging, or swinging your arms to raise your temperature and get your blood flowing., Whether you’re streamlining or kicking, flexibility can work wonders in improving your speed. Stretching, which conditions your joints to absorb force, is still popular. However, coaches are increasingly recommending mobility drills, which train your joints for improved range of motion.Mobility exercises with a tennis ball can make your shoulders more flexible. Lie on your back, and place a tennis ball between your spine and rear shoulder bone.
Place your arm on the floor with your palm facing upward.
Slowly move your arm across your body to touch the opposite hip.
Move your arm diagonally so that your hand is overhead.
Move the tennis ball to the other side of your spine, and repeat with the other arm.


Training with a monofin can improve flexibility in your ankles. Start out with four to six 25-meter lengths each week. Increase your sets, distance, and time using the monofin as your ankles strengthen. Regular training allows you to track your improvement easily., In addition to training in the water, you need to have a regular exercise routine. Aerobic exercises like running will help improve your endurance.Resistance training and calisthenics will keep your core (abdominal and back) muscles strong enough to support the motions of your arms and legs., Training with a buddy allows you to hold each other accountable for making it to practice, arriving on time, and not leaving early. Choose a teammate who you enjoy spending time with and who enjoys spending time with you. Come to a mutual agreement what days and times you plan to train in the water and on dry land. On the rare occasion when your buddy can’t make it, have a back-up plan ready to keep you motivated.

, As your training session ends, slow down your pace. Then, transition to easy strokes and kicks. Swim 200 to 800 meters to prevent lactic acid buildup in the muscles., Stretching reduces muscle soreness and the risk of injury.Focus on the muscles that get most use during your training. These include:Deltoid stretch: Extend your left arm across your chest. Bring the back of your right hand to your left tricep and push back until you feel your left shoulder stretching. Repeat with the right arm.

Trapezius stretch: Extend your arms straight ahead of you. Turn your palms outward and interlace your fingers.

Pectoral stretch: Place your hands on the back of your hips, palms down. Try to squeeze your elbows together until you feel your chest muscles stretching.
Hold each stretch for 30 to 40 seconds.

Warm up and find a good spot to practice.,
Start off by doing a back jump dive.,
Position yourself to try a back dive.,
Perform the back dive.,
Increase the speed of your dive.",How to Back Dive1," Get the blood flowing to your muscles to prevent injuries and loosen up. Do some stretching and/or some form of cardio as diving prep.Find a spot on the edge of the pool in the deep end to practice your dives. Do not dive into shallow water. If the water you’re diving in is nine feet deep or less, then the water is too shallow to dive in.


Make sure you have a coach there with you to act as your spotter during your dives.Start out diving as low as possible (from the side of the pool) and then work your way up to the diving board.;
, Stand at the edge of the pool with your back to the water. Raise your arms above your head so that your body is one straight line.Bend your legs.As soon as your knees bend, very quickly swing your arms backwards in a circular motion (or counter-clockwise). Your arms should make a full circle, coming back to stop beside your ears, hands together above your head in a dive position.
Jump back (at least a foot away from the deck) into the water. Enter the water feet-first.Before, during, and after the dive, your arms should remain straight above your head. Your head and body should be aligned.
Practice this a few times. Try to jump with your body held straight, but entering the water at an angle.

, Go to the edge of the pool or the edge of the diving board and turn your back to the water. Allow your heels to hang over the side. Balance on the balls of your feet, onto your tip toes.Mimic the movements you made with your arms when you practiced a back jump dive — they should be stretched above your head and your body should be in a straight line. If you are on the board, begin bouncing gently.
Bend your legs in preparation to use the pressure to set up the action of diving in the next step. As you bend your knees, quickly rotate your arms behind you in a full circle, bringing them back to the original position beside your ears, hands above your head.

, Arch your back slowly. Continue arching until you feel your body begin to fall — at that point, push yourself backward off the board. As with the jump dive, try to keep your body in a straight line — your arms should be straight, your toes pointed.You can attempt a back-bend first, which is the same thing without throwing yourself off the board or bouncing the board — you just let yourself fall into the water.
Keep your eyes open as you dive so that you can see the water. This will assist you in keeping your head neutral, your and arms and your body straight as you enter the water.Your hands should enter the water first, held in the diving position (or flat-hand position).

, As you get more comfortable, you'll want to speed up the movements. Instead of slowly arching your back until you begin to fall, you should eventually reach a point where you are no longer falling back off the board or side of the pool — you are just launching yourself off into the water."

Perform drills to help you dive.,
Position yourself for the back dive tuck.,
Make the takeoff for your dive.,
Start the tuck position.,
Prepare to enter the water.,
Gain control of the dive.",How to Back Dive2," After you warm up, use a trampoline to practice tucking. Your coach must be there to spot you so you don't hurt yourself. While standing on the trampoline, act as though you are doing a back jump. You will be jumping into the air and landing on your back on the trampoline.While you’re mid-jump on the trampoline, pull your knees against your chest, forming a tuck position. Grab your knees to your chest for second, then kick your legs out to 45 degree angle before landing.
If locating a trampoline isn’t convenient for you, practice back jumps from the side of the pool deck you’re using. Do a back jump tuck directly into the water. Instead of landing flat on your back, try to enter the water smoothly at an angle.
From there, move the jump up to the diving board from the deck. Get comfortable with the jumps and once you’ve completed a set of three to five jumps, try the dive.

, Once you feel comfortable with the tucking motion, you can practice diving into the water. Again, start low, diving off the edge of the pool into the deep end, and eventually work up to the diving board. As always, make sure your coach is there to spot you.


Stand backwards on the edge of the pool or diving board with your heels hanging off the edge. Raise your arms above your head in the diving position — hands together, arms in line with your ears.If you are on the board, start bouncing gently. Let your arms drop behind you, whipping them around in a quick circular motion. As your arms return to their position above your head (imagine your entire body being in the 12 o'clock position on a clock), you’re ready to take your dive.

, Position your body at a slight backwards angle and jump up and away from the board.To help keep your head in a neutral position, try picking a point on the back of the diving board (or pool deck) and focusing on this spot as you dive.

, Without moving the upper part of your body (including your head — don't tilt back and look for the water), bring your knees to your chest (do not bring your chest toward your knees).Grab your shins as your knees come to your chest.

, Extend your legs for the kick-out and entry part of the dive. Make sure your body is tight during entry, especially your stomach muscles.Kick your legs out to a 45 degree angle.
Keeping your legs at this angle, you can now look back toward the water.
Bring your arms back up over your head to resume the flat-hand or diving position, moving them up along the center of your body.
When you enter the water, your body should be almost vertical, positioned at a very slight angle.

, Learn how to control your body during the back dive tuck to have the most successful dive. Practice the back dive tuck on 1-meter and 3-meter diving boards to master the movements."

You should also understand the basics of diving., Stand backwards on the edge of the 1-meter diving board. Your shoulders should be in a vertical line over your hips. Place your arms down at your sides.Keep your head in a neutral position and begin to rock the board.
Lift your arms over your head, keeping them straight. Begin to quickly rotate your arms behind your body slightly.
As you rotate your arms, bend your legs to prepare to jump from the board.

, Swing your arms forcefully into a back press. Keep your head aligned with your arms.Jump up and out off of the board.
Once you’re in the air, your feet should be pointed towards the board and your body should be at a backward angle.

, Extend your arms in a straight position overhead near your ears. Point your legs towards the diving board at an angle in the air so that they “chase” your head and arms.Rotate your arms behind your body quickly in a small half-circle. This action will increase the momentum of the rotation for your flip.
Bend your legs into a tuck position and grab onto your shins once your arms have completed the half-circle movement.

, Hold your tight tuck position briefly. Keep your eyes open. Look for the board and use it as your signal to come out of the somersault at the right time.Fold yourself out of the somersault/tuck position once you see the board. Aim your legs towards the water and slightly in front of you.
Punch your feet into the water at a slight angle so that your body finishes the rotation you started.
As you enter the water, place your arms at the sides of your body.

But swimming can certainly be taught by ordinary people. The person teaching should be a strong, confident swimmer, have the skills to teach the various skills, and the patience needed in any teaching situation.


If you have anxiety about swimming, you are also likely to pass on your fears to your student no matter how well-meaning you are.
You may not remember how you learned to swim. Typically swimming is taught to young children, so you may not remember how exactly you were taught years ago. Or you may not remember certain parts.;
, Some teaching strategies are counterproductive and should be avoided.


""Sink or Swim""/ ""Viking swim lesson"", in other words, having a person forcibly put (such as tossed by an adult) into deep water. The driving idea behind this lesson is that the person will struggle and be afraid, but will overcome this fear and learn quickly that it is possible to get to the side. Typically, this just re-enforces a person's reluctance to get in the water, and builds distrust in you as an instructor; he or she will be unlikely to swim for pleasure and thus not become a good swimmer. At worst, the person can drown.Using the term ""Drown-Proofing"". Being able to swim does not mean a person cannot drown. Many water-related deaths were by people who could swim competently. This is an outdated and misleading term.
Demand a perfect float or dive. Some swimming programs demanded students pass skills such as floating or diving. While both of these skills compliment swimming and teach good skills, one can be a great swimmer while not mastering them. If the goal is to teach swimming, keep the focus on swimming.

A very skinny and/or muscular person may not be able to float well, but swim just fine. Many Olympic-level swimmers do not float well.
Diving demands a certain form, and a few people have real trouble with elements such as keeping the legs together. But for everyday swimming, or in an emergency, this really is unlikely to matter.



, If a person cannot swim, it is natural that there will likely be a lot of anxiety over getting into the water, much less swim. The older the swimmer, likely the greater the reluctance. Gently introduce the learner to being in the water, starting in the shallow end of the pool.Do not rush the person into being more comfortable in the water. You will not be able to teach anything about propulsion, floating, breath control, or any other aspect of swimming unless the person feels confident enough to relax and explore.
Take small steps. For someone very afraid of the water, just getting three steps into the pool may be a huge achievement. Do what he or she is comfortable with, then take it just one bit further at a time.
You may want to hold your student's hand (as long as it is a small individual) to make them feel less anxious.
Very young students wearing flotation devices are fine to have swim in deeper water as long as you are comfortable in this area. Since a toddler cannot touch the bottom in the shallow end, it is just as ""dangerous"" as the deep end. In fact, this approach avoids making ""the deep end"" a forbidden, hazardous place for a student--which can be an anxiety about swimming for novice students.
Let your student hold onto you until he/she is ready. Instead of you deciding when to let go, let your student decide. This can help build trust in you.

, A relaxed, joyful approach helps ease anxiety and increase curiosity and risk-taking. It is also often a positive distraction.For example:


Provide colorful floating toys for children to reach for in the water. This helps children learn to stretch out the arms (rather than contract defensively) and feel water is a fun environment for exploration and play.
An adult may be anxious standing in the water away from the pool wall. However, tossing a beach ball back and forth acts as a focus--away from feeling anxiety at being away from the safety of the wall and building a feeling of relaxation, fun, and safety.

, Although flotation aids can be helpful in building skills and confidence, they can become a crutch.


Do not use ""arm floaties"". These devices easily come off, and restrict arm movements. Swimming requires a lot of arm movement, so these inflatables are highly discouraged. They also give children a false understanding of the physics of being in water.Kickboards are very useful in teaching swimming. They allow for just enough flotation to the arms to isolate the kick. And although they float, students cannot use them entirely as a support.
""Bubbles"" are often useful. They help the student float a bit more, and encourages a horizontal position in the water. As the swimmer becomes more confident, the amount of flotation can be reduced until no longer needed.

, Your job as a swim instructor is to build on a novice's confidence. This means finding where he/she is, and gradually add skills. You may also need to know a student's limits. A student who is not confident in treading water for more than a few seconds should probably not go in the deep end for very long if at all. A student who can swim freestyle for 100 yards competently may be ready for recreational swim at the pool, but not ready to do a triathlon., Sit on the side of the pool, next to the learner. Demonstrate how to do the arm movements of a very simple stroke which you will be doing properly later. He/she should copy you, and you should correct any mistakes he/she makes. Keep repeating these steps until he does the stroke properly. To help him/her practice this put your hand under their stomach to keep them buoyant., Get the learner to hold onto the side with his/her arms, and kick with his/her legs. Give him/her guidance as to how to kick correctly, so that he/she can feel confident when he/she finally starts to swim. It may be easier for the learner to do this on his/her back so that he/she can see his/her legs as he/she is doing it., This is a big step for some people, without a side to hold on to, and so it may take a bit of time. Again, the general advice is to hold the learner's hand, and give him/her a buoyancy aid. He/she should try treading water - you should demonstrate this again if he/she doesn't know how it works., Get him/her to swim short distances in the shallow end of the pool, in a simple stroke which he/she feels comfortable with. Don't push the learner to do too much at the moment - this will probably be the first few strokes of his/her life., This may not happen immediately. In fact, it will probably take many learning sessions to get to this stage. Make sure to support him/her both physically and mentally - this will be hard for him/her.

, This will help him/her decide which one he/she likes best. Get him/her to swim a width of freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and any other easy-to-hard stroke you can think of. Don't put too much pressure on the learner. Make it fun for the student so that he/she will want to learn more., Typically, a novice swimmer has learned to not go to into deep water. ""The Deep End"" becomes a place of fear and anxiety. However, a competent swimmer needs to be able to swim where he or she cannot simply stop and touch the bottom. Also, to learn skills such as diving, one cannot stay in the shallow end.


Do not bring students in the deep end un-supported until he or she can swim about a pool length without stopping to touch the bottom. Physically being able to swim without stopping is a requirement for the deep end. Some students will routinely stop and put a foot down to assure that they are in shallow water, even if they can physically swim the distance. Either way, the student must be confident and strong enough to handle not simply being able to stop.
Your student can simply hold on to the side of the pool and pull themselves along. It may take a few goes to get to the other end of the pool. Lead the way, showing that it is safe, and go a little bit further each time. Try visiting with a lifejacket or other flotation devices. Cruising through the deep end wearing flotation devices will help build confidence. Doing things like jumping into the area with a life jacket will help the learner feel that this isn't such a forbidden zone, but more like just another part of the pool.

, When the learner is prepared to do this, which may not be for quite a long time, you should carefully ease him/her into the deep end. To start with, you should stay close to the side and make sure that the learner feels secure. Eventually, he/she will be able to swim on his/her own, and that is a job well done.

, Once the learner is comfortable with swimming from the shallow end to the deep end, the next step is jumping in to the pool at the deep end. At first, the learner should get used to jumping in and then holding onto the wall. Then, once jumping in is no longer a challenge for them, he/she should be encouraged to try jumping in and swimming across. At this point, the learner has achieved a basic grasp of how to swim.It's important to save jumping in until the learner is comfortable with the deep end, because it can be dangerous to jump in at the shallow end, where he/she could hit the bottom and hurt themselves.

When the official says, ""take your mark,"" you must take your mark and not move until the signal to start is given. You cannot move your feet, hands, head or chest after you take a position.;
, The next chance you have to DQ is on your underwater pullout. In every pool, the lane lines have red lines marking about 15 yards (13.7 m) out. If you surface past these lines, then you are automatically DQ'd. Also, if you start doing any other stroke besides butterfly, you will get disqualified.

, On your turn, both hands have to touch the wall before your feet and you may not push off on your back, only your side.

, Then there is your transition to backstroke, the key part here is to not go on your stomach during your flip.

, You may only turn on your side for one second and take only one freestyle stroke before your flip. You also can't stroke and flip at the same time, they have to be two separate movements.

, This is the hardest part of the I.M. You can only start your transition after the flags and again can not last for longer then one second. You place one arm at your side and one arm in streamline position. The leading arm touches the wall and you must push off the wall with that arm.

, Here is where the league you swim in becomes a factor. In USA swimming, you can take one dolphin kick after you bring your arms down, but in high school leagues, you can take one dolphin kick before and after your pullout. You can also only take one stroke of breaststroke under water.


The breaststroke to breaststroke turn is similar to the butterfly turn because it must be done above water and both arms must touch.

, This is the same as the previous turn except that, instead of going into breaststroke, you go into freestyle where you must do dolphin kicks and not flutter. Also you must start stroking the moment your body touches the air.

, This is a flipturn where you push off the wall like a normal flipturn.

Practice your dolphin kick.",How to Swim the Butterfly Stroke," The arm movement in butterfly stroke can be broken down into three parts: the pull, the push and the recovery.









Starting with your arms extended above your head (shoulder width apart), pull your hands towards your body in a semicircular motion, palms facing outwards. Remember to keep your elbows higher than your hands. This is the pull.
At the end of the pull, begin pushing your palms backwards through the water, along your sides and past your hips. This is the fastest part of the arm movement and provides the momentum necessary to complete the release.
A good way to remember the pull and push sequence is to imagine making the shape of a large keyhole with your hands underwater. The pull is the wide part of the keyhole at the top, while the push is the narrow part of the keyhole at the bottom.
The last part of the butterfly arm movement is the recovery which is where your hands must be positioned as they are in motion while finishing your pull and are getting ready to begin the subsequent stroke. Essentially your hands must reach your thighs. A good way to ensure that you have done this part of the stroke successfully is to drag your thumbs on your thighs as you are finishing the stroke. Next, sweep both arms out of the water simultaneously and throw them forwards into the starting position. Your palms should be facing outwards so your thumbs enter the water first, not your pinkies. Also, make sure the distance between your arms as you enter the water is no greater than shoulder width apart as this will greatly decrease entry drag allowing you to cut through the water more efficiently.;
, The dolphin kick is the name given to the dolphin-like kick of the legs used in butterfly stroke. Imagine kicking your legs like a dolphin (or a mermaid!) would kick its tail underwater.









With the dolphin kick, both legs move simultaneously, and should be pressed together to avoid a loss of water pressure.
You should kick twice for each stroke of the arms in butterfly stroke. However, both kicks are not exactly the same - there is one small kick and one big kick.
The small kick is performed while you are making the keyhole shape with your arms. This is because your arms are providing forward momentum in addition to your legs, so the kick doesn't need to be as strong.
The big kick is performed during the recovery, when your arms come out of the water. During the recovery you tend to lose momentum, so you need a big kick to keep your body moving forwards.
The most common mistake beginners make when performing the butterfly stroke is to kick in a uniform fashion, without alternating between small and big kicks., It's not just your arms and legs that are required during the butterfly stroke, your whole body needs to get involved!









Practice moving your whole body in a wave-like fashion. Think about the way that a dolphin or mermaid moves in the water -- your body should form an undulating S shape as you swim.
More specifically, when your chest rises your hips should be at their lowest position, and when your chest falls your hips should be at their highest position, with your behind breaking the surface of the water.
If you can get your timing right and manage to synchronize your body movement with your arms and leg strokes, you will find the butterfly much easier to master. You will be able to swim faster and find yourself getting tired less easily., Breathing during butterfly stoke can be a little tricky, as it has to be perfectly timed and completed pretty quickly.









The correct point to take a breath during butterfly stroke is when your arms are just coming out of the water at the beginning of the recovery phase.
As your arms are about to come out of the water, raise your head until your chin is just above the water and take a breath. Do not turn your head to the left or right - it should be kept straight. However, some swimmers who swim in the FINA World Cup do breathe to the side. This is not illegal, and may be more comfortable you. Begin by trying face forward, but try side breathing if you find it difficult after some time. As your arms recover drop your face back into the water and tuck your chin in so it touches above your chest. This will help you to lift your arms a lot higher.
Avoid breathing on every stroke, if possible. Every time you lift your head out of the water to breathe, it will slow you down slightly. Try breathe to every other stroke, or even less if possible. Of course, on longer races you may have to breathe more, but balance your need for breath and for speed.

, By combining all of the steps outlined above - the arm stroke, the dolphin kick, the body movement and the correct breathing technique - you will find yourself doing the butterfly stroke!









However, bear in mind that this is a tough stroke to perfect and it will take time and practice before you are able to synchronize all of these movements and swim the butterfly stroke correctly.
Learn good technique. Incorrect butterfly technique can lead to problems in certain muscles and joints, such as the rotatory cuffs in the shoulders if done for long periods of time. It will also make the butterfly stroke harder than it actually is.
Use a coach. Learning butterfly stroke just by reading about it will not work any more than reading a book will teach you to ride a bike. A swim coach can walk you through the stroke in more detail. A coach will also be able to observe you while you swim and pick out any flaws in your technique -- in this way, a knowledgeable outside perspective could be invaluable in helping you to improve your butterfly.

, The first drill you can use to practice your butterfly technique is the one armed butterfly.









Start with your arms at the 11 o' clock position, or shoulder-width apart. Begin swimming, using the dolphin kick.
On every fourth kick, complete a single stroke with one arm, keeping the other arm pointing straight ahead.
While practicing this drill, you may breathe to the side, rather than lifting your head straight out of the water as you do in full butterfly stroke.
Once you have completed a full length of the pool using a single arm, switch to the other arm to build strength and technique evenly., This drill is great for improving balance and giving you more control over your stroke.









Begin swimming using the dolphin kick, with your arms straight out in front, one shoulder-width apart.
Instead of the regular arm stroke, practice doing two strokes with the right arm, followed by two strokes with the left arm, followed by two strokes using both arms simultaneously., This drill is great for understanding the rhythm of the dolphin kick, while also helping you to time your breathing better.









Keeping your arms locked at your sides and your head underwater, propel yourself down the length of the pool using only the dolphin kick.
Try to alternate between big kicks and small kicks, as described in the previous section, and to get a feel for the rhythm of the movement.
Breathe on every fourth or fifth kick, synchronizing your body movement with your breathing in the way that feels most logical and natural.
Once you have developed a greater understanding for the rhythm of the movement, you can add your arms back into the stroke."

You NEED to start off slow and small.,
Look online for other free runners in your area to train with.,
Watch videos and learn how people move.,
REPETITION IS KEY!,
Keep safe.,
If you're young and just got into free running, don't use it to ""show off"" in front of your friends.",How to Start Free Running," During your first few months it is recommended that you condition your body every day and practice small techniques repetitively to build muscle coordination and confidence. Performing some form of Calisthenics & a bit of weight training goes a long way.;
, Do a quick search on freerunning in your country or state. If you train with an experienced free runner they should be able to guide you and give safety advice.

, This will mentally prepare your mind for when you go out and train. Think of the muscles you will be working. (This is known as muscle-mind connections.)

, Practice that vault 100 times, practice that wall-run 100 times, practice practice practice. That is the secret to success in freerunning - repetition and practice. You will not wake up one day and be able to jump 12 feet (3.7 m). But if you've been practicing your 6 feet (1.8 m) jump continuously you will find that in a few weeks a 7 feet (2.1 m) jump is within your reach. Soon 8 feet (2.4 m), and so on and so on.

, Safety is a huge priority in free running. Always check your surroundings, always listen to your body, and never attempt anything to ""show off"". Freerunning is following your own path - you do not need to please others and get yourself injured, it is about pushing yourself to be better than what you were before and learning how to move fluidly and gracefully.

, Getting injured isn't cool. What are you going to tell your mom then?

Know every rule of the park.,
Wear appropriate clothing.,
Be friendly towards other visitors.,
Use the buddy system if you have a group.,
Don't be rude towards snack stand workers.,
Don't throw dirt or rocks at cars or other visitors.,
Use kid-friendly language.,
Don't run near the pools.,
Don't cut in line or jump in rides when it is not your turn.,
Try to avoid recording footage of you on rides with a video camera.,
Be nice to everyone and smile!",How to Avoid Being Thrown Out of a Water Park," Before your visit, study the rules of the park. Do they allow picnics in the park? Is alcohol allowed? Do babies have to wear swim diapers? When you visit, you should know the rules as if you are an employee at the water park, and follow them. The rules are there for a reason, and many of them are to regulate park safety.;
, This means nothing revealing, no logos that you would not want young kids to see, and nothing that violates park rules. And avoid wearing white swimsuits - when they get wet, you'll basically be exposed, and you'll be asked to leave the park.


Make sure your clothing is secure. If you're wearing a swimsuit, you'll want to make sure that it's not loose on you, and that anything that needs to be tied is tied. Nobody wants to get kicked out of a water park after losing their swimsuit and getting humiliated in front of everyone.

, Being rude, annoying, stubborn, or violent will get you thrown out. If somebody asks you for directions, give them politely if you know, or if you don't know, tell them, ""I'm sorry, I don't know where that is. I'm sure somebody else would, though.""


Don't fight with people, even if you're just play-fighting with your friend. Most, if not all, areas of water parks are quite wet and slippery. If you push someone, even as a joke, you may end up regretting it if they end up slipping and hitting their head.
Avoid pulling out something that may be perceived as a weapon. Things like toy guns, for example, are a definite no-no, especially if you point it at someone.

, Never go anywhere alone, because some parks don't let people wander around with no buddy if the person is in a group. If you're under the age of thirteen, stay with an adult or with your friends at all times. It's smarter, and if you're with your friends, more fun!

, They deserve lots of credit for their service. Use your manners; say ""please"" and ""thank you"", and if the employee makes a mistake, bring it up politely.


Some people may think it's funny to taunt snack stand workers or try to extort money from them. If you see this happening, speak up! Say something like, ""Hey, that's mean! Stop that!"" or ""Stop trying to get free food! People have to make money too, you know!"" The employee will definitely appreciate it.

, Snowballs thrown at people are fine, but rocks can hurt people and smash car windows. Dirt can distract a driver and make other visitors get cheesed off when they get covered in soil. Never throw a snowball at a car for the same reason you shouldn't throw dirt. And remember how the receiving end feels - it hurts to get sand in your eyes!


In some parks, throwing things - even dirt - can be considered misconduct and get you removed from the park.

, Do not swear, use racist terms, make rude jokes, or threaten people. If you wouldn't want your grandmother to hear it, chances are, you shouldn't use it in front of a little kid.


If you do end up accidentally offending somebody with bad language (for example, you slip and instinctively swear), apologize immediately and try not to use bad language again.

, Obviously, the area around the pools, which is usually concrete, is typically wet. You could slip or ram into somebody. If a lifeguard keeps having to tell you to walk, you may be removed from the park.

, It is rude, and it's risky. At best, somebody will stand there angrily at you; at worst, they'll cause a fight and get the both of you thrown out of the park. Additionally, if an employee catches you cutting in line, you'll be sent to the back of the line or prevented from going on the ride entirely.

, You could drop or ruin your device, and it is usually against the rules. If you really, really want to record, though, try asking the ride employee for permission, but be prepared to be told that you can't.

, Be an all-around cheerful person. You didn't come to a water park to be grumpy - you came here to have fun, so let that reflect in your mood. And make sure you have fun, yourself!

, Vary the speed to develop speed and endurance.

, To mimic a real life situation the grip should be pronated (palms facing downward).

, This is a very important exercise as it strengthens your chest muscles and triceps.

, Explosiveness can also be developed some other ways such as plyometrics of the power type (low repetitions).

, The triceps will get worked from the dips, but the pushdowns will give you the mental imagery for the transition from the pull-up to the dip.

, The gymnast, on the rings, uses pure upper body strength.

, Prepare mentally, physically and with having the proper clothing, shoes and equipment.

, Your clothes should be loose and not hamper movement, and your shoes should be flexible and thin soled.

, Climbing down is difficult because you can't see where you are going, among other things. Jumping down from a height is a skill that has some use. Basically, the landing is on the balls of the feet, and the knees and hips bend to absorb the shock. There is balance involved (which is the sixth of the seven senses, the seventh being the temperature sensors). Balance is kept through that inner balance and with the body and arms. In the movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"", Dean had a few jump downs with excellent form and balance.

,







Put your hand on the ground, a little to the opposite side you are rolling.






Now, tuck your head to the opposite side and push forward rolling on your shoulder, diagonally across your back (left shoulder to lower-right back or right shoulder to lower-left back).






Try to curl into a ball while rolling.






After that, put your knee on the ground or stand up directly with two feet.







, Again, begin with a soft surface.

, Try with something about three feet tall. Make sure that you can launch yourself off of it though; it's safer to try small, but going fast will apply what you'll feel from a higher fall.

, After you jump, make sure to plot out your landing.

, Once the balls of your feet hit the ground, bend your knees (not more than about 90 degrees), crouch and lean forward as quick as possible . Make sure to push off of your feet to propel yourself forward.

, Be careful not to land on your neck, or mid back, as you might get hurt. Perform the movements explained above; curl your shoulder and land on it, but be sure to roll diagonally.

Practice the muscle up.",How to Parkour," You want a pair that has decent grip and shock absorption (forefoot absorption, too!) -- no skating, soccer, or football shoes. The ones you'll be wearing need to be flexible and light; it's less about protection and more about morphing with your foot to the surface. It is also recommended by many top traceurs (those who practice parkour) to have a shoe that does not have hard plastic in the center of the arch as this will cause your ability to balance on things such as rails to decrease significantly as well as raising the chance for injury.


A shoe with a good flat sole and as few pieces of rubber as possible is preferable as the little rubber nubs as seen on most running shoes will tear off with ease when training. Ideally the sole of your shoe should have one to two piece of solid rubber that way it will not tear free as easily and you will get more use from your shoe.
You may want good toe bumpers to cushion your cat leaps. And, of course, regardless of the shoe, if it doesn't fit well, it won't work. The shoes must be snug or else you are increasing your risk of injury on landings.
Don't concern yourself with brand names. If you are practicing as much as you should be, you will wear those suckers out in a few months. In addition, since you will be practicing outside, they are going to get dirty. Do not waste money on the looks of your feet.;
, As long as you can move quickly and your clothes are not restrictive, you are good to go. Just make sure they stay on and you will not find yourself messing with them as you move.


Climbing pants, since they allow you to move freely, and are durable, fit well, and don't get in your way. Gramicci, Prana stretch Zion pants (good), North Face, and Arborwear are recommended. Dickies are also durable and offer free-range of motion. Jeans are not recommended, as they are too stiff and do not allow enough freedom of movement. Again, if you have that favorite pair of sweats (that stays up!), go for it.
Shirts do not have to be anything fancy, but it is good to have a sweat wicking type. REI and running shoe stores have these. Consider wearing long sleeves to prevent scrapes while first learning.

You are going to want to stay cool, so you'll probably want to don cotton.



, You may think your delicate little mitts need protection from all the hard and possibly dirty surfaces you gallivant over, but resist the urge. You do not want to deprive your mind of the sense of touch -- after all, you need to know how a surface feels to know how easy it will be to climb. You may get a few scrapes, but you'll be all the better for it.


For the first few weeks, you may come home seeking the ice pack. Soon enough, your hands will get used to the work you are putting them through.

, Not only will your friend help keep you motivated, but they will show you things that did not even occur to you, forcing you to learn.


Another choice is a Parkour coach. Someone who has been in the game for a while will be an invaluable resource in shortening your learning curve -- and they will help keep you from getting hurt. If your social network isn't pulsing with the energy of a thousand traceurs, start doing some research; there are Parkour groups worldwide that are always looking for new members.

, Find some area of the concrete jungle that looks enough like a maze but poses less of a challenge (and danger) than the Great Wall of China. Once you have found one, find another. You will need various obstacles to keep your mind and skills fresh.


Before you go darting from parking garage to parking garage, however, try mastering your way through a park first. Grass stains are a lot easier to take care of than broken femurs.
Stay off private property. The police will not look at you and go, ""Sweet, man! How would you get your leaps to look like that? Can I take a look at the definition in your calf muscles?"" If trouble does find you, be polite and go on your merry way. Few will understand the purpose of what you are doing, and that is fine.

, You are going to be running, jumping, and rolling until the cows come home -- so getting your lungs into shape is priority number one. Hit the treadmill, the elliptical, and start swimming and boxing. Then when you hit the obstacle course, you won't be concerned with getting winded on top of everything else.








Even activities like yoga and lacrosse (and other team sports) have their place in Parkour training. If it keeps you going for long periods, do it. Go until staying active for an hour at a time is a piece of cake.

, Once you have gotten your lungs up to par, it is time to focus on your muscles. You won't need to be doing any serious weightlifting because, let's face it, moving a car out of the way is a lot slower than just jumping over it. However, you work with your own body weight and constantly lifting and propelling that. Start doing push ups, pull ups, squats, and leg lifts like it's your second job.








It may seem like training as much as possible is ideal, but your body does need time to heal. Keep the muscle-building exercises to every other day (twice a day is okay if you do not work out too hard) to give your muscles time to heal themselves. They will be all the better for it in the long run.

, If you have your 5k down and you are doing three sets of 15 reps, twice a day every day of those four exercises, good. Now do more. Do not let your body plateau. Aim for 10% more next week than you did this week. It will be good for your spirit and motivation to boot.









Add extra exercises on or switch up your activity routine. Keeping your body guessing is key to developing all your different muscle groups. If you normally swim, go play rugby. Switch a day of squats and leg lifts for planks and sit-ups. Your ability to focus may heighten as well.

, If you injure yourself, you are out for good. Do not tackle an obstacle you think you may be able to do. Your nerves may get the better of you and get the better of your landing. Even if you think that you are not getting hurt, you may need to think of some of the long-term effects of the things you are doing to your body. You need to condition and make your body used to doing certain things without over-stretching or bruising it.









Start exploring what your body is comfortable with. How high and far can you jump? How quickly can you get into a roll? You will find the techniques to start with and what techniques need more work. It will also help you gain awareness of your body and body control.

, There is a basic landing that you will be incorporating into all basic drops. The principles of this basic landing will be used for the advanced landing (the Parkour roll) as well. Therefore, it is important you learn and master this technique first. There are four main key points you always want to remember:









1) When you land, your legs will be about shoulder width apart.
2) You must land on the balls of your feet. That way your body will act like a spring and distribute the landing. If you land on your heels, your body will act like a stiff board and will injure the rest of your joints and body.
3) You will not allow your legs to bend below 90 degrees. Bend below 90° and you put too much strain on your knee joints and you slow yourself down.
4) When you have forward momentum, or are taking a higher drop, lean slightly forward and allow your hands to absorb some of the force. This will keep your legs from bending below 90° on the drop and enable you to continue your run. Only use this basic landing for small drops.

, This move is one of the most basic but useful tools in your Parkour toolbox. A shoulder roll is a forward roll diagonal across your back over the shoulder. Shoulder rolls are important because they reduce the impact of the landing, by converting the downward motion of a fall into forward motion, where you can easily begin to run again.









If you are a doing one on the right side you would bring your right arm close to your body and tuck your head and neck close to your chest. Then, roll over your right shoulder and come up onto your feet at the end. The reason you roll diagonally is to reduce the damage to your back and spine.

, These help you clear obstacles easily and with speed. A vault should essentially keep your forward motion going while you are clearing an obstacle.









Find a rail. When you run up to it, place both your hands on it and propel your legs to the right. When your knees come up over the rail, move your right arm out of the way, and swing your legs over. You should then be able to land with ease and balance. If balance is an issue, finding a rail of a different height may help.

Once you have mastered this, practice doing it to the left.



, You should never jump off anything higher than you yourself can jump. This is because if you repeatedly land on your legs from extensive heights you will damage your knees. Always practice precaution.









Find a flight of steps. Start low and work your way up. Once you have done a step 10 times, kept relaxed, and always landed on your toes, move up. Repeat until you have done that step 10 times, relaxed, and always landed on your toes. If balance is an issue, don't move on until it's not., How else are you going to be able to climb over walls? The muscles you use in doing pull ups are the same ones you will be employing in hanging off and getting over walls. Find a bar where the ceiling is still a ways away and get practicing.









Start pulling up a bit farther when you are doing your normal pull-up. Get to the point where your elbows are in line with the bar. Then, pull up farther -- bringing your chest over the bar. Get to the point where you can pull up and bring your arms straight over the bar, with it resting near your pelvis. Use your legs to propel upward from a hanging position.
Get your intervals down to split seconds. Once you have mastered the basics, start timing yourself on the same courses. How much time can you knock off?
This is when a friend comes in handy. Pick an area and find point A and B. Then, either time each other separately or as you both make your way through the course. What is the faster one doing the slower one is missing? A split second here and a split second there can add up and put the final changes on technique.

Warm up.,
Select a rail or wall to monkey vault over.,
Run up to the obstacle at a medium rate, somewhere between a jog and a run.

,
Plant with both feet 4 or 5 feet away from the rail and spring up.

,
At the same of your spring, place both hands on the rail, a little wider than shoulder width.,
During your jump, tucking your feet up and bringing them between your hands.,
Remember to lean forward when you are in mid air.,
While you're at the top of the rail, look for your landing.,
Once your feet are through, let go with your hands and prepare for your landing.,
Run away and smile - you've just monkey vaulted.",How to Monkey Vault," Spend at least 5 - 10 minutes stretching and warming up before doing parkour. Do everything, but focus on ankles, legs, knees, butt and shins.;
, You don't have to be able to jump over it, but pick an obstacle you can vault over normally with ease. Also make sure of what's on the other side - vaulting into a 5 meter drop is a recipe for disaster. Rails are the easiest obstacle to start with. The obstacle mustn't be too low, either - it should ideally be somewhere around your belly button or slightly higher.

,,, Make sure there's enough room for your feet to get between them, but at the same time make sure they are not too wide or your legs will be lower and your feet will get clipped.

, Make sure not to clip the rail with your feet, so tuck up a lot! As you jump try to push yourself forwards, this will stop your shins falling onto the bar.

, I can't stress this enough. The main reason to lean forward is so that you don't clip your feet. When you lean forward, your feet will be higher and won't get clipped.

, Pick a spot for your feet to land.

, try to land softly, minimizing impact.

, Now do it all over again.

Get in shape.,
Practice landing and rolling moves.,
Practice vaulting, jumping and climbing maneuvers.,
Practice regularly.,
Use self-exploration.,
Pick a point and do whatever it takes to get there.,
Develop your personal style.",How to Get Started in Parkour or Free Running1," You must have endurance. Work on basic calisthenics like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and squats. These are the basic building blocks for practicing parkour. Experts say you should be capable of performing 25 push-ups, 5 pull-ups and 50 full squats before you formally get started in parkour.;
, Parkour entails a lot of vertical movement. High jumps can be painful if you don't know how to land properly or safely fall, then end with a move.You should start off with a jump between 1/2 a meter to 1 meter. Land on the front part of your feet with your legs bent and if you have jumped from a higher distance then perform a forwards roll.To do this roll you should roll on your shoulders not your back if you roll on your back you may do serious damage to your body.

, These more difficult maneuvers are designed to get you up and around obstacles in the urban landscape. As you begin to practice more frequently, you will learn which moves you prefer and develop your own unique style for practicing them.

, Like all sports, parkour requires regular training to be effective, otherwise your skills will drop off. Practice at least two or three times a week, and make sure to maintain your basic skills while moving on to more difficult maneuvers.

, Begin to drill the techniques that you have created, establish new ways of moving through experimentation, and find new paths and environments to master through self exploration. When you are in tune with yourself, no one knows what works better for your body than you.

, Start with a slow, safe pace. Trace a path between two points over and over until you are a master of your territory. You should notice a gradual increase in your speed, endurance, and the ease with which you transition between obstacles.


This progression can take hours, days, and even years depending on the path you choose, your natural ability, and several other factors. The important thing is to continue progressing no matter how slowly. This method is the essence of Parkour, and will lay the foundation to understanding it.

, Approach obstacles in a way that is unique to your body and abilities. The common movements employed by others do not necessarily make sense for you. That is precisely why it does not make sense to rely on videos as a way to learn. Once you have overcome this mental obstacle and risen above the poor standards set by many others, you can take your training in many different directions.

"
"
Start to train with other people.,
Use training as a collaboration.,
Get a Parkour coach.",How to Get Started in Parkour or Free Running2," Getting together with a small group (2-4 people) can shed new light on your training regimen. New people offer new ways to move, different paths to take, and constructive criticism of your methods. Since you have already developed your own style, the ideas offered by new people can only expand your possibilities.

, Be sure that ideas are not stifled and no individual person sets the bar of what should work for everyone. This method works best as a creative discovery between friends. On the other hand, if you followed someone else's method from the beginning, you could be stuck with a style that does not actually make sense for you.


Remember that while large gatherings have the potential to be an extension of the smaller training and discovery sessions, too often they devolve into a roaming herd that quickly grazes over obstacles while looking for the next big trick. Understanding Parkour through self discovery is the sure way to avoid falling victim to this Personal experience makes a traceur and his Parkour unique.

, This option can be helpful to someone who does not know how to condition themselves or prevent injury. However, experimenting by yourself first is highly recommended. By entrusting your early development to a stranger, you run the risk of following a path that is completely wrong for you. A good coach will help you get started and drill you in the essential moves necessary to begin parkour and will also teach you how to stay safe. A good coach will set you down the path of discovery and help you form your own style, while a bad coach will set you down their own path.


As Parkour gets more popular, an increasing number of people are trying to cash in as coaches. Be wary of anyone who does not offer their services for free at least part of the time. A coach who is still connected to the community through free outdoor training sessions is a good bet.

Tread lightly.,
Get the proper gear.,
Begin by choosing A and B.,
Develop flow.,
Exercise regularly.,
Practice regularly.",How to Get Started in Parkour or Free Running3," Some surfaces take damage more easily than others. Be respectful of where and how you interact with your environment, and take responsibility if you accidentally damage something. Check out the surface you are on or will be going on before trying anything remotely dangerous on it. Importantly, that surface may also be slippery, fragile or unstable so survey the area first. If you slip or something moves/breaks under you it could cause a painful fall.

, You won't need much. All you need is a good pair of running shoes and an outfit you're comfortable moving and exercising in.

, Try to trace a path from A to B. Go through the path and do everything that feels natural in that situation. Parkour is not a set of vaults, movements or ""stunts."" It is a way of moving, and moving is always changing, and no set motions could be ready to meet the quota. A good way to find ways to get there is trying different ways and consider what is efficient and fast.

, This is what separates traceurs from your average trickster or acrobat. Flow is the flawless transition from one obstacle to the next, to the point where there might as well not be any obstacles at all. Flow can be practiced simply by adding good form and correct technique, thus creating fluidity to all of your movements. This includes soft landings (as opposed to stomping down or falling).

, Make sure to keep yourself in peak physical condition. Traceurs and traceuses use most of their body in order to navigate any obstacle. This level of involvement requires total body fitness.

, Find a spot that you can come to every day to train. Good areas include diverse obstacles (walls, rails, etc). Your overall goal is to find creative ways to make it through the ""sea"" of obstacles using your body in any way necessary.

First, be sure to understand the need for high level of physical ability in order to prevent injury from dangerous feats.,
Find a location with a stair set that has stairs.,
Check your surroundings and surfaces.,
Work your way up to the particular obstacle by practicing pieces of the technique (e.g., jump off of the first step 5 - 10 times) until you have mastered the technique at that level before moving on.,
The impact of your landing should be absorbed by the muscles in your legs and not by the bones or tendons.,
While in the air, spot your landing.,
Landing with a lot of forward momentum will require you to roll in order to avoid falling and/or injuring yourself.,For an excellent example of this, watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbs7wDqViY4
",How to Jump Down Stairs in Parkour1," Beginners should start by learning the proper way to squat, jump, and roll before attempting any running drops such as those explained in this article.;
, As stated, safety is paramount, so do not attempt to do anything you have not trained your body to handle safely.

, Do not attempt if the environment is unsafe.

, The technique must be flawless.

, Serious injury can and will occur if you repeatedly land improperly.

, Extend your legs out to reach the ground before you land, then as you land you should absorb with your legs, slowing the descending acceleration with your muscles. This is comparative to a spring compressing.

, DO NOT ROLL ALONG YOUR SPINE OR YOUR HEAD! Roll over your shoulder instead, there should be no pain.

For the sake of practice, it’s a good idea to start with level ground.
Mark a spot for your landing, or choose an already-marked spot. A basketball court is perfect for this.Stand about 30 inches from your landing spot.;
, You’ll be landing on the balls of your feet and might be tucking to roll, so prepare your body for those movements.


Face forward, directed straight at your landing target.
Your feet should be parallel, about shoulder-width apart.Align your body (legs over feet, shoulders over legs, standing straight).

, This prepares your body for the jump, giving you the spring load you need for momentum.

, It can help to bend your arms, holding them close to your body. This gives you more control as you move through the air., Point your toes, with your legs together."
"
Start off by practicing a somersault this will help with what happens in the roll.,
Once you've learned that find a large patch of grass.

,
Start off crouching and choose an arm that you feel stronger supporting your weight on, hold your OTHER arm in front of you, keeping it slightly bent with your hand flat on the ground.

,
Bring your strong arm out in front of you, bent at the elbow, so your lower arm is parallel with the ground and hold it across your body so your hands are near each other.,
Lean forward onto your arm and hand and get used to the idea of rolling onto your arm and hand.

,
Try going into a crouch from standing, and as you finish the crouch, drop forward into the rolling position, tucking your head in,to keep it from hitting the ground.

,
Try to roll with more weight on the strong arm, your aim is to keep the roll on the ground (no ""falling"" onto your back which will only hurt) and roll from your strong shoulder, diagonally across to your opposite hip.,
Remember you are not rolling straight forwards, you are aiming to turn your body slightly into the roll so that your strong arm and shoulder is what you roll on, making you roll at an angle to your spine - this will make the roll fast and smooth and avoid damaging your spine when rolling on hard surfaces.

,
Once you can roll perfectly every time, and you are comfortable, try starting at a slow run, and then go into the roll (it may help if you do a small hop before dropping into the roll) build up your speed until you can do a roll at any speed.

,
Now you have mastered the roll, try adding it in after you jump off something, this will help redirect the downward energy of the jump, reducing the impact and allowing you to use the remaining energy from your jump to keep moving forward.

Vault at full speed.,
Leap like a cat.,
Swing through the air.,
Land solidly.,
Roll to absorb landing impact safely.",How to Practice Parkour1," While doing parkour, you will often need to bypass medium-sized obstacles without slowing your run. To do this, you will likely perform a speed vault:


As you approach the obstacle, kick off from the ground using your left leg while raising your right.
Simultaneously reach your left arm forward and place one hand flat on the object. Avoid contacting the obstacle before your body is airborne.
As your hand catches the obstacle, use the momentum from your kickoff to bring both legs together up towards your right side.
Use your left arm as a pivot to direct your body's momentum over the obstacle.
Once you're over the object, land on your left foot to regain vertical posture. Return to your run.;
, In a ""cat leap,"" the traceur jumps onto the face of a wall and uses all four limbs for grip and balance. While in the air, position your arms in front of you so that your hands can grip the wall ledge when landing. Orient your legs to be nearly parallel with your arms and so that your feet will connect with the wall's face first. Allow your legs to absorb the impact, bend at the knee, and catch the ledge with your hands.


A cat leap can be done using almost any type of leap as a base, from running jumps to vaults. As long as you can orient your body so that all four of your limbs can extend forward, you can turn a normal leap into a cat leap.
In practice, this move is typically used to reach slightly higher surfaces. From this position, the traceur often pulls his or her body up onto the top of the wall., Find a horizontal bar you'd like to swing from and jump towards it. Before catching the bar with your hands, curl your body and bring your legs up and forward. Once your hands make contact with the bar, add to the momentum and direct your body forward.When you are doing parkour, be careful that any bars you grab onto are sturdy enough to hold your weight.

, Any time you land, you will need to do so safely. In general, you will be landing upright on two feet. This could easily cause injuries to your knees and wear out your joints over time if not done properly. Keep the following in mind when landing:


Land on the balls of your feet. This is the semi-flat space between the toes and the arch. When you land, angle your feet pointing downward while lifting your toes.
Don't land with your legs straight. Bend your knees to absorb the shock of your landing.
Never bend your knees to an angle less than 90 degrees., Rolls can be done at the end of a controlled drop or after an unexpected fall. Their purpose is to spread out the force of impact, preventing injury. With practice, a quick roll can even be done painlessly on concrete. Until then, it's best to practice on soft surfaces, such as grass and gym mats. To execute a roll diagonally across your back:


When practicing, begin in a standing position with one leg slightly forward. The leg in front should correspond to the same side as the shoulder you plan on rolling onto.
Crouch down into a squat, placing your hands on the ground palms down. The hand of the side you're rolling into should be slightly behind the other, making a diagonal line with your front foot. The opposite hand should form a straight line with your back foot.
Push with your front leg to create momentum. Roll onto the corresponding arm and then drop onto your shoulder.
When your shoulder hits the ground, tuck your back leg into your side. Shift your weight and use your momentum to roll from your shoulder to your hip on the opposite side.
Hit the ground with your front foot first as you finish your roll.
It's extremely important to keep your head up and away from the ground at all times."

Go for daily runs.,
Build functional strength.,
Practice quadrupedal movement.,
Get your feet used to minimalist shoes.,
Learn to love calluses.",How to Practice Parkour2," Running is a major component of parkour, so your training should include this element. The time and frequency you should devote to running will depend on your personal preference and skill level. Most casual runners run only three times a week to prevent injury, while many serious runners do so twice per day.


If you don't already run as part of your exercise regimen, start out slow with short runs every other day. As your endurance increases, you can then gradually add miles to your weekly run goal., When you parkour, you will need the strength to do things like jump, climb, and vault your way past obstacles. As such, you will need to develop muscles in your legs, arms, and core. Squats, push-ups, pull-ups, and lunges are excellent exercises for this type of strength training that don't require specialized equipment to do.


Remember that the amount of force you'll need to generate is proportional to the weight of your body and that muscle is fairly heavy. Because of this, traceurs tend to be lean rather than bulky.

, Learn to crawl quickly on your hands and feet. When doing parkour, you will use quadrupedal movement to crawl under objects and fit into tight spaces with swiftness and ease. Practicing quadrupedal movement is also an excellent workout in and of itself, as it exercises all four of your limbs along with your core.

, Because parkour relies heavily on tactile feedback and freedom of movement, most traceurs avoid bulky running shoes. You should look for a shoe that has thin soles while providing excellent grip and arch support.If you are not already used to this type of shoe, you will need to take the time to adjust to wearing them. Before doing parkour in them, go for a normal run fist. It's also wise to wear them around the house and for low-impact walks before doing any type of running at all., While you may see some traceurs wearing gloves to protect their hands, they are not generally recommended. Gloves reduce feedback between your hands and your environment, increasing the likelihood of dangerous mistakes. Instead, practice without covering your hands and encourage the formation of calluses.

"
"
Plan parkour routes when you aren't running.,
Join a parkour group.,
Find the right spot to practice.,
Try new locations whenever you can.",How to Practice Parkour3," You can do this when you're walking around your city or taking the bus to work. Look around you. Take note of nearby structures and think about how you would interact with them to get from an imaginary point A to point B.


If there is a large horizontal bar in your path, does it make more sense to vault over it or slide under? Which would be faster for you?
Where do you see potential footholds on the sides of buildings?
If there is a gap between ledges, could you make the jump, or should you climb down one and climb up the other?

, Use Internet resources to locate parkour groups in your area. With local contacts, you'll be able to find the best places to practice and do parkour. If you are a beginner to the sport, you will also be able to find qualified parkour coaches to teach you.

, Parkour has its roots in military training obstacle courses. If you have access to a military-style obstacle course, take advantage of it and practice your parkour skills. If you don't, there are still a few options for you to practice:


Find other types of obstacle courses in your area. With parkour's increase in popularity, more and more facilities specializing in obstacle course training are opening up.
Join a gym with gymnastics equipment. You can practice your parkour moves on bars, ropes, vaults, and balance beams all with the safety of soft mats underneath. Keep in mind you may need to reserve space for use. Some gyms also feature rock walls for you to safely practice climbing.
Public parks are also great places to practice parkour. They usually feature wide open spaces for you to run on and low to the ground structures like tables and railings for you to use as obstacles.

, Once you get comfortable in your abilities, try moving through new areas. Remember that parkour is meant to be done in almost any environment. If you're bored with your current practice spot, look around for a new one. Ask members of your local parkour community where they like to practice or do parkour.


Be careful not to practice on private property without permission from its owner.

However, simply having the games on in the background while you're reading, playing on your iPad or staring out the window isn't the same as actively watching and learning. So, while watching, be sure to listen to the commentary and to study how the teams are playing. Whether it's about an unselfish offense (passing the ball more), or it's about an aggressive mentality on defense, try to take it all in and learn from it. Learning the different parts of the game will make it far more interesting for you and will improve your appreciation of the game. And always gather the following basic information about the game:


What teams are playing?
Which one are you supposed to be rooting for?
Who's the coach?
Who's the mascot?
What are the team colors?;
, There are shows like College Gameday on ESPN every Saturday that analyze the game, teams and the most recent news.


Listen to podcasts on college basketball. Go on iTunes and search for any college basketball podcasts to listen to more analysis on the game at your convenience.

, Overdressing in team paraphernalia is a great way to make others think you know more than they do about the game and team!

, Write down the name and ailment of one injured player for each side, and practice making mention of them during the game.


Use phrases like, ""Lambert would’ve had that rebound!"" Or ""Good thing they don’t have Boyd in the line-up!_"".

, If you're uncertain as to whether or not it's a good time to cheer or boo, just follow the crowd's actions. Stand when they stand, cheer when they cheer, boo when they boo.

, Learn some of the basic basketball lingo. They’re not bouncing the ball, they're ""dribbling"" it; when a player gets ""fouled,"" the shots he takes from the ""foul line"" are called ""foul shots"" or ""free throws.""


Pepper your personal banter with basketball terms, too. For example, when you get up to use the restroom, say you’ll be back after you make a few “offensive adjustments.”

, Pick out a go-to phrase, like ""Three in the key!,"" which is good to yell whenever an offensive player, which is a player for the team with the ball, is lingering for more than 3 seconds in the ""key,"" which is the key-shaped box that... Oh never mind, just shout it whenever a lot of people are crowded around the basket.


If you feel compelled to yell ""Slamma-jamma!"" after a big dunk or block, stop yourself. Relying on tired phrases from old video games is just lame.

, If anybody calls your bluff, immediately grow nostalgic. Mention how much ""purer"" the game was before the 24-second clock, the 3-point shot, or the A.B.A. merger came along.

, End with a basketball-related joke, especially if your team loses. On the way out, turn to your companions and say, ""Hey, we'll win next time – we're playing the Washington Generals!"" That’s a really bad team.

, Catch up with your buddies and talk college basketball at the end of the year while watching the end of the national championship, drawing on all of the suggestions from the above steps.

Join a parkour group.",How to Do a Wall Run in Parkour," You'll be primarily using your legs to perform the wall run, so be sure you thoroughly stretch and warm up your legs. You might also want to take a quick jog or warm up run so your body is prepared for the exertion needed to run up a wall.;
, While getting a feel for the mechanics of this move, you'll want to approach your vertical obstacle at a moderate speed that allows you to gauge which foot you will strike the obstacle. You may want to keep your hands raised in front of you to brace yourself or guide yourself as you run up the wall.Once you are comfortable with all the motions involved in the wall run, you should increase your speed as you approach your obstacle. Start at a moderate speed and, as you draw near your obstacle, speed up.
Many experienced traceurs, the term used for a parkour practitioner (the feminine form being traceuse), recommend you avoid favoring a foot when doing a wall run. This encourages adaptation of your movement to your environment, which is a basic principle of parkour., When you are one pace from the wall, you'll need to raise one leg in preparation for contact with your vertical obstacle while jumping with your other. Typically, you should make contact with the wall at approximately the same height you raise your one foot off the ground., You'll want the forefront of your foot, from the ball of your foot to your toes, to come in contact with your vertical obstacle. You'll have to react quickly, gripping the wall with your foot and driving your leg downward to redirect your forward momentum upward.If your foot connects with the wall incorrectly, either the force of your push will be directed away from the wall or you will not have enough grip on the wall to change your direction upwards.
Connecting with the wall too high will make it difficult for you to drive downward with your connecting foot. This will make it harder to generate the force you need to launch yourself up and over the wall.Listen to the sound of your foot as you come in contact with the wall. If you hear your foot strike loudly, this is a good indication that your force is being directed into the wall, instead of being directed upwards., Depending on your reflexes, strength, and skill, you may be able to raise your trailing foot to the wall in the same fashion you did your leading foot. Much like your leading foot, you'll want the forefront of your trailing foot to connect with the obstacle from the ball to the toes while driving downwards.Keep your hands in front of you to help guide you up the wall. Having your hands in front of you can protect you from slamming into the wall if you came in too fast on your approach.
Your hands should also be at the ready to grab on to the lip of the top of your obstacle. It is unlikely that you'll be able to vault to the top of a tall obstacle without the assistance of your hands.
Especially skilled traceurs can sometimes get in several steps for even greater vertical lift. When practicing this maneuver, you should start with a single step, adding more as you become more comfortable with the motion., To successfully overcome the obstacle, you need to continue your upward motion by catching the lip of your obstacle with your hands and pulling your body to the top. Failing to do so can result in you stalling out, which could leave you hanging from the lip of a tall obstacle., The motion of the wall run itself is foreign; humans rarely experience the feeling of trying to run up a vertical object. Your first few tries don't have to be perfect. Even if you jog up to the wall and find yourself pushing off and away from the wall, this will help you to familiarize yourself with the forces involved in the wall run.

, Find a tall wall where you can practice. Then, with tape and a ladder, mark off several heights ascending up the wall all the way up to the top. As you become more familiar with the mechanics and begin redirecting your forward motion to propel yourself up the wall, aim for the closest piece of tape up the wall.


As your technique improves and your body strengthens, aim for a higher piece of tape. It may take several hours, days, or even weeks before you can consistently achieve your maximum height., Some obstacles will be smoother than others, and some will have a slight slope inward or outward. As parkour is an art that intends to adapt human motion around obstacles, to master the move you'll need to be comfortable on virtually any surface.Practicing your wall run on different surfaces has the added benefit of helping you recognize obstacles you should avoid. Some will be too smooth for your foot to grip and push of off. An experienced traceur knows his limits., To execute parkour moves well, you'll need to be in good physical shape. Most parkour moves involve functional movement and cardiovascular exertion. To execute this well, you should:


Run
Do bodyweight squats and jump squats

Do push ups
Do Leg Lifts

Do Pullups, This is a great way to get encouragement, inspiration, and to receive instruction from more experienced traceurs. These meetups, sometimes called ""jams,"" involve traceurs practicing together at their own level and pace. Be sure to wear clothing that is comfortable, doesn't restrict motion, and potentially protects you in the event you take a tumble. Some options include durable, loose fitting cargo shorts/pants and athletic shorts. The shoes you choose should fit well, be comfortable, and have good grip.Facebook and google are valuable resources for connecting with other traceurs.Simply typing in your city (or the closest large city), state, and the word ""parkour"" into the search function of either of these can put you in touch with people who share your interest."

Obtain the ""Things You Will Need"" from the list at the end of the article.
,
Lay your bicycle down so that the side of one handlebar rests over the sheet of paper on the floor.,
Remove your bike and refine the tracing, smoothing out edges and adding more seam allowance.,
Place your pattern piece over the fabric and pin it in place.,
If you have side mounted brake lines such as Shimano Ultegra or 105's, you will need to draw a line from your brake hoods back to your handle bar.,
Pin the two sides of each mitt together.,
Sew the two sides together along the top and bottom edges.,Finish the seams you just sewed by either zigzagging over the raw edges or by sewing bias tape to cover the raw edges to prevent fraying.,
Finish the pointed, narrow end in the same manner as above, taking care to leave enough room for that end to slide up and over the ends of your handlebars.,
Turn the mitts ""right side out"" so that the seam allowances are to the inside.,
Pin the hook and loop (aka ""Velcro"") strips to the edges of your brake line slit and bottom handle bar opening to form closures.,
Place the mitts on your drop bars and enjoy warmer hands on your next cold ride!

",How to Design and Sew Cold Weather Mitts for Drop Handlebars,",  Trace the handlebar shape onto the sheet of paper.  Add approximately 1/2 an inch all around to allow for seam widths.  Add another 5 inch ""wedge from the top point of the handlebar brake ""hoods"" back toward the wrist.

,  (You can always sew it smaller later on... but if you cut the pieces too small, you cannot enlarge them at a later point.)  Take care to add around an inch extra to the seam allowance by the narrow, bar ends.  This opening must be able to slide over the ends of your handlebars later on.


,  You will need to cut four of this shape from your quilted material.,  This will be where you will cut a slit to accommodate your brake lines.

If you cut a slit for your brake lines, you will need to finish the edges of that slit before you continue with the mitts.  Sew your bias tape over the edges of the slit or roll the edges under and away from the open edge to prevent fraying.
Note the cut line in the ""template"" or ""trial version"" on the left. This was placed on the handlebars and cut ""in situ"" to find the correct placement of the brake line slit.







,  You should have two, opposite, mitts.  Double check this while pinning so that you don't inadvertently end up with two right handle mitts and no left mitt or vice versa.,  (marked with red lines in the picture) You will need to leave two openings.  One for the hands and one for the handle bar end. (small, pointed end.) Note in this picture, the slit for the brake lines has already been finished.

,,  (These should fit loosely.  If they are tight, you will need to unpick some of the seams to enlarge the opening to allow them to slide over smoothly.),  Finish the edges of the hand openings by sewing a strip of double fold bias tape over the edges.,  Stitch them in place.

Signaling.",How to Ride a Bicycle in Jakarta," Some cross-city commuters have taken to buying folding bikes which can be taken aboard the TransJakarta Busway shuttle. They ride it from their house to the Busway, and from the Busway to their office. Others who do not have to commute so far prefer light non-folding bikes that can be carried up highway crosswalks without much effort.


Even if you can afford a really expensive and fancy bike––don’t get one! Get a bike that’s reasonably priced. Don’t provoke thieves unnecessarily.
Find out whether your company provides any parking for bicycles. As in many developing countries, the bicycle ranks low on the totem pole and it is the odd person (read: eccentric) who chooses a bicycle as a commuter if that person has the means to get a motorized vehicle. That said, you may have to train your company’s security personnel to provide you with a sheltered and secure bike parking/stowage area.
Buy bike locks for both front and back wheels. Locks that can be extended to anchor against something immovable. If you have a fancy seat and seat post, buy a lock for that too. Jakarta is, after all, a big city.;
, American market bicycles have rear brakes connected to the Right hand lever while Japan and China (and Indonesian) bikes connect to the Left. This is important information if you do not want to be thrown off your bike in a panic stop.

, Contrary to the common conception of accessories being optional, there are accessories that are absolutely necessary if you’re going to bike:


Buy lights. Head lights and tail lights. Pack lights. Do not depend on the dynamo driven front lights, if you have them. Add battery powered LED lights. The visibility sets you out to drivers as different from the run-of-the-mill cyclist, and this awareness of you could save your life. Take care not to obstruct your taillight when stowing your backpack on the passenger carrier.
Buy a bike bell or any sound device. A clear-ringing bike bell. It could save you from some very minor crashes in the back streets and may alert many pedestrians, and to overtake a cart or rickshaw.
Have goggles or polarized clip-ons. You don't have to wear them all the time, but they are particularly useful in certain seasons of the year, when traveling at dawn or dusk, when there are lots of flying insects that could easily get in your eyes.
Have a basket (if possible) and certainly a passenger rack/seat in back. Two or three short strap down bungee cords as well. A basket is a very useful utility tool. The bungee cords will stow your backpack perfectly on the passenger rack. Panniers are nice but they are uncommon and expensive in Jakarta.

, It does not pay to dress plainly if you’re going on a bike. You want to stand out, be different, be visible and thus be treated differently, hopefully deferentially. It does not hurt to dress like a person who can very well afford a car but prefers to ride a bike. This results in policemen and container truck drivers taking extra care around you.

, Depending on office circumstances, you may or may not have showers. In any case, it feels better to have a fresh shirt at the office.

, It is common for newbies to load the front basket heavily, not realizing that this makes steering tricky and difficult. It is better to place your goodies in a knapsack that you can strap down on the passenger seat behind you with the bungee cords. In the rare instance that you have two heavy bags, tie them like saddle bags to the far rear (away from the path of your feet as you pedal) using tying straws. Take care that they do not obstruct the spokes.

, Do not wear noise cancelling earbuds headphones, as hearing comprises a large part of your road awareness. It is easy to teach yourself to listen for the deep bass sound of container and cargo trucks, but it is more difficult to train yourself to hear the sound of mini-cargo trucks like the Isuzu Elf.

, When riding in a pack with them, pull over on the shoulder and stop. Let them pass and then proceed.

, They are, for the most part, your biggest nemesis on the road as most are undisciplined and reckless. Always assume they will cut your path or charge ahead instead of slowing down. Let them pass when they are bunched together, such as at a stoplight.

, It may be a nuisance, but it is certainly better than bodily injury.

, The road will be slick and it’s not worth the risk.

, Only travel at night or at dawn/twilight when absolutely necessary. Be extra careful and deferential to motor vehicles when traveling at night.

, It is common practice in Indonesia for companies to hire blue guards to stop traffic to allow their employees to drive in and out of their company compounds. Knowing the guards makes it more likely that these guards will be aware of your presence on the road and be more considerate of stopping you cold unless absolutely necessary. Besides, it makes for a great morning when your “road friends” greet you on your way to work.

, If you hear a vehicle honking behind you trying to overtake you, pull aside immediately and decrease your speed and let the vehicle pass you. Many of Jakarta's streets are quite narrow.

, In the city, bicycle lanes are very rare, so if there are no bicycle lanes on the street/road, ride your bike at the very left side of the street/road too let other vehicles pass you.

, If you are turning right or left, do not immediately turn. Check to see traffic coming up behind you. If you are mid-lane, a series of head turns toward the direction you intend to go will serve to indicate you intentions. But still, do so slowly and carefully. Remember that the motorcycle guys are the most unpredictable.

Find a clear, level space, free of obstacles and traffic.,
Put the bike in a low or medium gear.,
Mount the bike and sit with both feet in the ground and your hands on the handlebars.,
Adjust the seat to your height.,
Make sure the kickstand is up, if there is one.,
Apply both brakes and put one foot (your leading foot) on the pedal.,
Fix your target, in other words: look in the direction that you wish to go.,
Steer partly with your hands.,
Push the pedal, release the brakes, lift your other foot off the ground, and you're off.

,
Practice riding without wobbling.,
Practice slowing and stopping.,
Practice turning.,
Approach train tracks, gratings, and the raised edges of driveways and gutters as close as you can to perpendicular.,
Be very aware of road conditions.,
Be patient.",How to Ride a Recumbent Bicycle," Choose a surface that is paved, rather than loose material such as dirt or gravel, which can slip. Try an empty parking lot or wide, quiet side street.


Beginners will probably find it difficult to start on an uphill slope. Get comfortable riding before starting uphill.;
, If you have hub gears, you can change the gear while coasting or standing still (just release pressure from the pedals before moving the shifter). With derailleur gears, you may have to dismount and change gears while turning the pedals. It will help to have an assistant for this process, since you will either need to wheel the bike along or lift the drive wheel up.

, On under-seat-steering recumbents, place your legs to the front of the seat and to the left and right respectively of the main boom.

, Designs vary, but some recumbent seats slide forward and back along a bar (while others need boom length adjustment). As with regular bicycles, at the farthest point of the pedal's travel, your knee should still have a slight 15 degree bend in it. Do NOT lock your knee. You may also wish to adjust the tilt of the seat and the location of the handlebars at this stage, but those adjustments may have more to do with your long-term comfort than just getting started. Your feet should be able to reach the ground and the pedals comfortably.

, It's usually behind you on a recumbent, so it's easy to forget.

, Pull the pedal backwards with your toe until it is approximately straight up. When riding a recumbent, you will push back against the seat, rather than using your weight to push the pedals.

, Many recumbent beginners will look at the bike instead of the road, making them involuntarily lose their sense of orientation.

, What you used to achieve by displacing your center of gravity by moving around on the saddle is no longer possible. You will still steer partly by leaning, but you may need to compensate by moving the steering with your hands.

,, Make a few laps up and down the street and get the feel for the balance. Like other bikes, going very slowly is a good way to wobble more and have a harder time balancing, so try to get up to at least a good medium pace. The balance will be a little different from the bikes you have ridden, but the fundamentals are the same.


Change into a higher gear if you'd like. Again, change hub gears while coasting, but change derailleur gears while pedaling. Your recumbent may have both.







, Apply both brakes at once and get your feet ready to touch the ground and come to a stop. Get ready to start up again.


Remember that you will need to unclip if you are using toe clips or clipless pedals. Allow plenty of time if you need to unclip, or get a feel for the bike without clipping in.
Gear down as you slow down, so that you will be ready for your next start.
Keep the brakes applied the entire time if you're not moving.
Advanced braking techniques:
With front suspension, best control results from braking with the front brake first, then the rear. This permits front suspension to be compressed and prevents the rear wheel from locking-up, fish-tailing and losing control.
Low racers may be so low that it may be possible to stop while keeping one's feet clipped into the pedals, by putting one hand on the ground and resting upon it. Wear gloves and make sure you stop fully before putting your hand down, if you choose to try this.
Use your momentum to help yourself sit up if you have a fairly upright seat. Moments before coming to a halt, remove your feet from the pedals keeping your knees bent and raised (shoes unclipped if you use clips). As you stop, your momentum automatically lifts you upright in the seat and you can place your feet on the ground as you stop.



, As on an upright bike, lean into the turn, keeping pressure on the outside pedal to heel the bike into as vertical an angle as possible. Feather your brakes going into the turn, stop pedaling, and have the outside pedal down. As you become more proficient on your new bike, you'll be able to turn at fairly high speed.


Brake before a turn, not after you begin, so that you are traveling the right speed before you change direction. If you brake during a turn, you are likely to skid and lose control, resulting in a fall.
Be very careful turning on loose gravel, oil, mud, ice, snow, black ice (looks like a wet road but the tires make no spray), debris, trash, wet leaves, and wet or dusty ironwork. A recumbent will slip just like a regular bicycle and grab lips and edges that are close to parallel with the wheels, but it's harder to put a foot down in a hurry.
With some recumbents, the rider's feet can interfere with the front fork-crown or under-seat steering mechanism (if present). If this is possible, it is essential to stop pedaling around corners. With other types, such as long-wheel-base bikes, this typically cannot happen, so it is safe to pedal around corners.

, Recumbent wheels, especially small ones, will tend to grab lips and edges if you approach them close to parallel. Walk or lift the bike over tall curbs or steps, or if you're not sure. Don't try to hop up a curb on a recumbent.

, As recumbents become lower and faster, the ability to see the ground in front of the front wheel is substantially reduced. It becomes harder to spot debris and adverse surface conditions like pot-holes. Hitting such a depression or performing evasive maneuvers could unseat you.

, Don't expect to go faster than an ordinary bike immediately. Recumbents use different muscle groups and it takes time to develop 'recumbent legs'. Once strengthened, your stamina and speeds will improve. Initially, it is likely that a novice rider will be slower on a recumbent than on an upright bike. As a very rough guide, assume that this will take a minimum of several hundred to a thousand miles.

Decide how long you'll be gone.,
Plan your route.,
Start with shorter distances.",How to Cycle Long Distances1," The type and amount of food and gear that you bring are highly dependent upon the sort of trip that you're taking. If you'll only be gone for the day, then you'll need much less gear than if you plan to be on the road for the week, the month, or the year. Set your vision and check your expectations. Remember that you will need to carry everything you use.;
, Look at a map, and chart out where you want to go. If you have a destination in mind, figure an exciting way to get there. If your vision is looser, try to at least pick an initial goal to shoot for. The average long-distance cyclist goes between 40–60 miles (64–97 km) each day, although it is quite common to tackle much longer and much shorter distances.You may find that you start off cycling shorter distances, and work your way up into the 100+ kilometer range. Plan this gradual strengthening into your route.
Carry a map, a standalone GPS, or a smartphone with downloaded maps of the areas you'll bike through. Think ahead to possible stops in towns, rest stops, and camping locations. Have contact plans in case of emergencies.

, Even if you're in great physical shape, it is still wise to ease into the routine of biking monstrous distances each day. Start with shorter trips close to home. and gradually work your way up to longer distances. If you have been off your bike for a long time, even a mile or two will help you get back into the saddle. Several shorter trips will also give you the opportunity to road-test your gear.


If you are training for a long-distance bicycle race, try to train up to a ride that is 2/3 to 3/4 the distance of the planned event. If you are riding a century (100 miles), for instance, work up to the point that you can cycle 60-75 miles in one go. If you've gotten to this point, you're effectively ready for the big ride."
"
Dress appropriately.,
Consider how you'll carry your things.,
Pack an emergency kit.,
Take only the gear you'll truly need.,
Bring plenty of water and high-energy foods.",How to Cycle Long Distances2," Wear padded cycling shorts and a lightweight, breathable cycling jersey. At the very least, shorts and a t-shirt will do – anything that will wick your sweat, and that you can comfortably cycle in all day. Consider wearing gloves to protect your hands from the bite of the wind and the friction of the handlebars. Bring your clip-in cycling shoes, if you have them, but be sure to pack a lightweight pair of extra shoes so that you can walk around comfortably when you're off the saddle.Last, but not least: wear a helmet!


It is important that the shorts are padded. Cycling shorts are specially designed with extra fabric to protect your groin, rear, and inner thighs from the friction of sitting on a bicycle seat all day. Make sure that they fit well!
If it's cold, consider wearing leggings, thermals, or lightweight sweats over your cycling shorts. The slight added weight and loss of mobility will be worth protecting your bare legs from the wind-chill.
If it'll be bright out, wear sunglasses to keep the sun's rays out of your eyes while cycling. This is especially important if you find yourself biking directly toward the position of the sun!

, The choice is largely dependent on comfort and capacity. Feel free to use a backpack, if you'll just be gone for the day and you don't need much. If you are taking a longer trip, think about buying or making panniers so that you can easily carry things on the back of your bike. If you are going on a very long trip, consider building or buying a small trailer or caddie to pull behind your bicycle.

, Include a small portable tire pump, a tire patch kit, and a basic toolkit in case something goes wrong with your bike. Make sure that you know how to use these tools; practice beforehand! Consider carrying a basic first-aid kit: antiseptic wipes, ibuprofen, and a few band-aids.


At its most basic, your toolkit might include a set of Allen wrenches and a tire lever. You can use the tire lever to easily pry away a bike tire when you need to patch or replace your tube. In a pinch, you can use a flat-head screwdriver or another long, flat, strong object to get the tube out., If you're going for a multi-day trip, then you'll need a place to sleep – but consider foregoing the tent for a simple sleeping bag if the weather's nice. Weigh the importance of your heavy, expensive camera lenses against the practicality of carrying everything on your back. Perhaps you can read on your phone or Kindle instead of bringing a heavy book; wear clothes multiple days in a row instead of packing so many changes; and use various items to suit multiple purposes., It's essential that you stay hydrated and keep your energy levels high! Slurp from a Camelbak, or prepare several large Nalgene bottles. Bring bananas, nuts, whole-grain bars, and other healthy, high-density foods. Supplement with electrolytes for enhanced hydration and muscle function.Your body loses these natural minerals when you sweat, and it's important to replace them if you'll be exerting yourself for a while. You can mix electrolyte powder into your water; you can drink electrolyte-rich beverages like Gatorade and Powerade; or you can pop electrolyte pills, available in bulk from many outdoor-supply stores.
Avoid energy drinks, which may dehydrate you or set you up for a sugar crash. In general, avoid fueling your ride with sugary, processed snacks. However, some long-distance cyclists swear by high-calorie candy bars for their quick-release energy.

"
"
Stretch first!,
Pace yourself.,
Shift gears.,
Take regular breaks.,
Finish up for the day.",How to Cycle Long Distances3," Warm up for at least ten minutes before each long-distance bicycling session. Try dynamic stretches like star jumps (jumping jacks), jogging in place, and burpees. Be sure to stretch your legs out to reduce the risk of leg cramps. Pay special attention to the thighs.

, Start cycling at a speed which suits you, and try to keep up this pace as best you can. Use a lower gear so that you don't wear yourself out. Try to keep up a rate of roughly 90 rpm (revolutions per minute) on a low gear to go easy on your muscles and lungs.Do not push yourself too hard, especially if you'll be cycling for multiple days in a row. If you're cycling with a slightly-faster partner, try to check the temptation to keep up.
On the other hand: do not ride in a gear that is too low. If you're spinning the wheels without putting any effort into pedaling, you'll needlessly tire out your legs. Find a balance that works for you., When you come to an upward slope, change into a lower gear so that you can more easily reach the top. Change to a higher gear when going down a hill to create a bit more friction between your tires and the road. Throughout the ride, stay aware of how hard you're working. If you are struggling to push the pedals, you should switch into a lower gear to conserve your energy.

, Even if you feel strong, stop every 10–20 miles (16–32 km) to give your body a rest and ensure that everything's running smoothly. Rehydrate by drinking some water, and boost your energy levels with a quick snack. Check your bike for any problems. Stretch to keep your muscles from tightening. Continue to take breaks until you arrive at your destination.

, Continue to consume water and electrolytes for at least several hours after you are done cycling for the day. If you'll be getting into the saddle again in the morning, take a few minutes to look over your map, your gear, and your goals for tomorrow.

Prepare yourself mentally.,
Start the hill climb staying seated on the bike seat (or saddle).,
As you move up the hill, crouch down.,
Toward the top of the hill, stand up from the seat (saddle).,
Learn how to shift gear going uphill.,
Keep practicing.,
Try using low gear with a steep hill.,
In turns, take the long way on the outer side of the turn.,
Have a rest at the top of the hill.,
Descend with care.",How to Climb Steep Hills While Cycling," If you've cycled a hill before, you'll already know that it hurts physically and takes a lot of effort. If you've long been the sort to hop off the bike and walk it up the hill, you'll need a little mental prepping first!


Accept that riding uphill is more effort. Once you stop fighting it mentally, you can spend more time motivating your body and learning how to make the ride easier on you.
Get excited about the challenge of making it to the top of the hill. This is something that you're quite capable of doing and proving it to yourself can be a lot of fun in between the agony!
Don't expect to go fast. That's unrealistic and likely to wear you out before you've hardly begun.
Understand the benefits to your body of cycling on hilly terrain. Hilly terrain builds your fitness levels up by helping your body learn to use oxygen more efficiently. Also, the process of climbing the hill on a bike uses different muscle groups as you shift about on the bike to maintain maximum power. The climb allows you to work hard, and the descent allows you to recover, providing a perfect exercise workout per each hill.;
, Keep your weight back and hold the handlebars over the top and close to the center.Your hands should be about 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) from the center stern to allow maximum breathing. If your chest is open and shoulders back, you'll be able to breath much more easily.

, This requires you to keep your body low and your elbows low but slightly pointed out to keep your chest open for easier breathing and to keep your upper body relaxed., At this point, use all of your body weight to assist you in pushing down hard on the pedals. Standing up takes a lot more energy than sitting down, so don't overuse this technique; keep it till the last portion of the steep hill. Your hands should now sit on top of the brake levers.


Shift your body in time with your legs. Keep your back straight and your chest open to aid good breathing., Those gears are there to be used, and uphill they will definitely assist you with extra power if you change them effectively. However, it takes practice to get used to how it feels to change gears as a method of changing the pace and power when climbing a hill, so don't despair, just keep practicing it.


Shift the gears in anticipation of or just before each terrain gradient change, not once you've already reached each gradient. Keep pedaling while you change gears, so as to maintain momentum.The aim is to keep your effort as constant as possible.
A low gear is needed for going uphill (you'll need the higher gear for going back down).

, This technique won't be easy for the first few tries but it's important to persevere. It is only in the doing that you will learn the feel for climbing the hill on the bike and learn the right timing for shifting your body weight on the bike to achieve the maximum power for the least effort.


Start with shorter hills and gradually increase your trials to steeper ones.

, Once you're feeling more confident with hill climbing on a bicycle, learn the technique for climbing a hill economically. This technique requires that you stay seated and use a low gear, and don't rely on standing up for much of the time:Breathe regularly and deeply.
Keep it slow and gradual in the early stages of the hill climb. This isn't a race, it's about economizing your energy usage.
Select the low gear that will still allow for reasonably fast pedaling.
Sit up and hold the outer edges of the handlebars. This will ensure that your breathing is made easier by an open chest.
Once the hill gets much harder, and you notice you've no lower gears left to use, grip onto the brake hoods. Pull them to give you more power when pedaling.
Only now use standing briefly if needed. At this point, you should intuitively know what feels best for you in the combination between standing and sitting in the bike, for the most economic use of your energy.
Stay focused on a steady, rhythmical climb that makes the most of every turn of the wheels to pull you up this hill. This kind of slower but powerful riding takes time to master but it's efficient and is good for longer rides, such as when traveling through hilly country for long distances. You are far less likely to tire out than using the method that requires standing to get you up the hills.

, It may seem illogical, but you'll lose less momentum that way.

, For a particularly strenuous hill climb, a brief hilltop rest may be in order, especially while training yourself to get used to it.

, Be alert for obstacles like cars, pedestrians, animals, and objects on the road. Don't go down too quickly – use both your brakes to pull back the speed, and by sitting upright in your seat, so that your body acts like an ""air brake"".If you're descending over uneven terrain such as on a mountain bike trail, it's best to get out of the seat and let the bike take all the bumps for you. The steeper the descent, the further back you should place your weight while looking forwards."

Converted road and track bikes are quite the rage in flatter areas, with a single gear to maintain and no shifting to learn.,
Carbon fiber bikes generally don't allow bolt-on accessories, such as panniers and kickstands.",How to Commute By Bicycle," Don't just assume that the route you drive to work is the best route for biking. Often the best bike route includes back streets and side roads which may make your trip slightly longer but much safer and more enjoyable. Be realistic and honest with yourself. Are you really comfortable spending 20 minutes a day with the traffic from a freeway feeder whizzing by you at 60 mph (97 km/h)?


Your local bike shop will probably have bicycle route maps. Get one and map out your route to work. If there are no bike route maps, get on your bike on a non-work day and scout out the area.
Consider incorporating streets with bicycle lanes when starting out. Dedicated bicycle lanes are great for beginners, although more confident cyclists often consider riding on the road to be both faster and safer. ""Taking the Lane"" is when the rider rides down the center of the lane so no car is tempted to squeeze past with questionable spacing. Be aware of other users on bike paths, such as folks with strollers or dogs. Announce that you are passing on the left when overtaking someone on the bike path (a cough or ringing your bell is a minimum if not a pleasant ""I'm on your left!""). Do not sneak up behind someone overtaking them without warning them. It is more courteous to announce your presence, and well in advance.
You may find that your route to work in the morning is more highly trafficked in the afternoon and that you need different routes to and from work.
If necessary, combine bicycling with public transit. More and more transit systems are finding ways to accommodate bicyclists. If yours isn't up-to-speed, consider purchasing a folding bike to bring with you on a bus or train, or using two bicycles (one between home and your stop or station, another for between the stop or station and your workplace).

, If you don't have a bike yet, borrow one and make your test drive before purchasing one; it'll give you a better idea of what kind of bike you'll need.


Try some alternate routes, if possible. Make a note of how long each route takes you.
Avoid streets with excessive potholes or junk in the road.
Avoid questionable neighborhoods where your safety might be at risk. A public, open space is always better than a hidden alleyway.

, Ask your manager or supervisor. Maybe there's a closet or storage area where they'll let you leave your bike for the day.


Otherwise, find a street sign that does not pull out of the ground or a post to secure your bike onto with a good lock (or more than one, to further discourage theft).
If you lock to a traffic sign, remember that it might be possible for a thief can unbolt the sign and then slide your bike up over the top.
The best thing to lock to is a complete loop of welded metal that is securely anchored into brick or concrete. Second choice would be a pole with welded cross members wider than the longest dimension of your lock.

, Find a local bicycle shop. There, knowledgeable people can help you decide what to buy. See the ""Choosing a Commuter Bike"" section below for more advice.


If you buy a cheap bike at a discount store have it fitted to you so you're comfortable. If you buy an investment bicycle you may have a smoother ride, but you will always be worried if someone is going to steal your bike. What you buy will be for the same reasons you buy a cheap car.

,


Stay away from cables, which can be cut one wire at a time (quickly, too), combination locks, and locks using a cylindrical key.

, This is essential to remain safe and within the law.


Many places assign bicycles the same rights and responsibilities as a motor vehicle.
Most of the time, riding on the sidewalk can not only increase your chances of running into something or someone, but it can also earn you a traffic ticket.
Even if stop signs are optional in your area, you can never be sure how a car will react if they are at the intersection, too.
Register your bike if required.

, A flat tire, loose brake cable, loose seat post, or loose handlebar, an unbalanced wheel, or other minor adjustments may pop up while you're commuting. Be ready for them.


Prepare and carry a lightweight, bicycle-specific toolkit. Include metric Allen wrenches that fit your bike's bolts, a screwdriver, and/or a multi-use tool designed specifically for bike maintenance.
A pair of latex, disposable gloves can come in very handy because it's hard to get the grease off your hands once you arrive at work.
A lightweight air pump or CO2 cartridge inflation device, tire levers, and a tube patch-kit do not add much weight, but on-site repairs can be time consuming. A spare inner tube is nice, but it's only ""single-use"" without a patch kit.
A good compromise is to have a spare tube for on-the-spot repairs, and then use the patch kit to repair your tube when you get to work, so that you can then use your repaired tube as the spare for the commute home. You may even want to invest in ""flat free"" tubes or tire liners.
Puncture-resistant tires work well if you plan to commute daily, especially over gravel or where there may be broken glass. They are worth the extra money.

,


Keep a reasonable distance between your bicycle and parked cars. The most common accident for commuting cyclists is running into a suddenly-opened car door.
Don't make any sudden turns, or weave in and out of traffic. Make your course steady so that drivers can anticipate your position.
Use hand signals to indicate a turn or, better yet, invest in an electric turn signal or use the old courier method of physically inserting yourself in front of the car that may turn into you. Road users are legally obliged to make signals in most countries, and even if you are not, it is necessary for your safety to make sure that the people around you are aware of what you are about to do.
Don't allow a tailgating car to bully you into squeezing into the side of the road when it's not safe. It's better to slow down traffic than to put yourself in danger. When there's enough room on the road for you to pull to the side safely, do so and let the cars behind you pass.
Exercise caution when riding in the rain. Metal surfaces are slick and your ability to stop isn't as good.
Many cars not using their turn signals will turn a bit before stopping- learn to look for this indicator. The driver's movements can also offer clues to their next moves.

, You will need something in which to carry your work items. There are many types of bicycle luggage carriers. Backpacks or messenger bags might work, but the lack of airflow against your body may generate more sweat in warmer climates.

Look for a stabilizing strap around your waist or ribs to keep the bag from shifting while you pedal.






Look for panniers (a pair of bags or boxes hung over the rear wheel) that are waterproof so that you can protect your things from the rain. Even with a waterproof bag (which can leak around the seams or openings), it's smart to wrap your clothes in plastic bags, as well as keep spares at the workplace- shoes, socks, and underwear at least, a full change of clothes if there's room.
Folding shirts can lead to big creases, so if you need to look smart, try rolling your clothes instead of folding them.

,


Often in cities, bicycles are not easily accommodated and drivers are not used to sharing the road. Many people feel much safer with a cycle helmet. A bike helmet will protect your head when you are mounting and dismounting (common times for falls), and it will make you more visible to motorists. It will also offer some protection for your head if you have a crash when riding.
Helmets are ""single-use"", so throw yours away if it's done its job in a crash. Cracks or flaws are not always discernible to the eye and a new helmet is cheaper than a new head!
Many people choose not to wear their work clothes when they're riding to work if the weather is unpredictable or hot (see Tips). Prepare an outfit specifically for rainy days.
Generally, what you wear depends on your budget and comfort, but during bad weather, it's important to be prepared. Stock up on ponchos, rubber overshoes, and waterproof gloves. Look for jackets with ventilating zippers under the arms. Grocery bags can waterproof a helmet in a snap, as well as your seat if it has a porous cover. Waterproof socks or overshoes are useless unless you have pants to direct the rain over and away from the tops of the socks. Wool is more expensive and takes special care but it provides a wider range of comfort in the weather than other clothes, even keeping you warm when wet!
Don't wear anything that can get caught in the chain or wheels. Tuck your shoestrings into your right shoe, and get a strap to wrap your long pants cuff around your right ankle so that nothing gets caught in your chain ring.
In humid areas, use wicking polyester materials to keep sweat from fostering a skin fungus. Allow these clothes to dry fully, rotating out two sets every other day, wash them with mild detergent, and dry on low heat.

, Some ""extras"" could make a huge difference in the quality of your ride.


Consider installing fenders on your bicycle to prevent puddles from splashing onto your bike and your body. The ""rat-tail"" fenders that clamp onto your seat post are only minimally effective. Invest in a set of full fenders--stainless steel, though heavy, is the best, most durable solution. Next best is aluminum bonded to plastic. Polycarbonate fenders will also do the job, but they are of significantly lower quality. Also, be aware that some bicycles (especially those designed for racing) have very little clearance for installing fenders.
Comfy seats are worth investing in on upright bikes but don't get one that's too big, or they will get in the way and chafe. Seats with a recessed area down the middle reduce pressure on our sensitive areas. More padding does not mean more comfortable; if the saddle is too soft, numbness can become a problem. Experiment and see which saddle is right for you. Stay away from gel-padded seats; they break down under exposure to the elements and create an impossible mess.
Get a mirror. You wouldn't drive a car without a rear view mirror, would you? You can find mirrors that fit on your handlebars, your helmet, even your glasses. Get at least one of these.
At some point, you might end up having to ride in the dark. As a precautionary measure, install lights on your bicycle. You don't want to be riding on the roads at night with standard reflectors, and riding a bicycle without lights after dark is illegal in some countries. Install a white light on the front and red light on the back of your bike for after dark. LED technology is very advanced now, offering great lights at easy prices. Look for units that use AAA or AA batteries (which can be swapped out for rechargeable batteries). Lights with their own rechargeable batteries are more expensive and generally brighter; these are for seeing where you are going.
If you have a nicer road bike, and don't feel comfortable locking it outside, consider the purchase of a full-bike bag, which will allow you to roll your bike - wheels and all - into the bag, and carry it inside. The bags weigh only about 5 pounds, and can be carried quite easily in a backpack. If your building has security guards, consider a nice holiday ""bribe""--they'll call your bag ""the big laptop.""

, Your legs (and rear end) might be sore for a few days or weeks. Don't give up! You'll get used to the workout soon, and you'll start noticing new muscles in your legs. Keep moving forward and enjoy the scenery.

, Bike shops are accustomed to stocking bikes for recreation, not for commuting, and the features on mountain bikes don't really benefit you as a commuter unless you're the aggressive type and need a more sturdy steed.


Swap out the knobbies for durable slicks in this case but don't bother with full suspension. If most of your riding will presumably be done on pavement, you're better off with a hybrid, comfort, touring, road or singlespeed, designed for riding on pavement.
You may also want to consider a recumbent bicycle. Ultimately, the most important factors when choosing a bike are comfort and efficiency.;
,


The hybrid is a bit more efficient where the comfort bike takes the bumps better; both feature a very comfy and upright pedaling position, good for taking the strain off your body.
Touring bikes are beefier versions of road bikes but with more relaxed pedaling position, though usually not as relaxed as comfort/hybrid bikes.

, Track bikes have a fixed gear, so no rear brake is needed once you've gotten the hang of these stripped down speed machines.


Watch out for your knees, though: a fixed gear means the pedals are directly linked to the rear wheel, eliminating the bike's ability to coast. Advanced fixer cyclists can ride a fixed gear bike in reverse by back-pedaling.
On a recumbent, whose lower center of gravity also takes getting used to, this more powerful pedaling position is infinitely more comfortable. These faster recumbent bikes have pedals higher or level with the seat. Lower pedals indicate a more comfort-oriented recumbent. Most recumbent bikes offer better aerodynamics than other bikes once you get up to speed, as well as a seat-back to add leverage against the pedals.
The lower point of view makes you wish you could see through cars sometimes and must be recognized. Longer recumbent wheelbases are more stable, where shorter wheelbases are quicker and more maneuverable; test rides are generally offered at good recumbent shops, so take your time choosing and testing if you're looking to avoid the body pains of upright bikes.

, This means that if you buy a carbon-fiber bike you will most likely have to use a backpack, which can be hot on a summer day. Also, it may be more likely to fall over without a kickstand.

Choose your route.,

Book accommodation in advance.,
Train for the expedition.",How to Cycle the American Southwest," Figure out where you want to go to before you head off. There are several factors that should influence your choice:


The elevation plays a factor. Generally speaking, from El Paso TX heading westwards till Colorado River, there is a drop in elevation making it easier to cycle.
The desert is a real factor. It's hot, dusty, lonely, and lacks services and water. Be aware that most National Parks and National Forests have specific restrictions on where you can ride.Check their websites when planning your route.
You also need to ensure that there is some way to transport your bike to and back on your journey, unless you are supported, then you just need to be driven back. If you do not have that luxury, look where the Amtrak pick-up points are, or check out where you can fly in and out. If you fly, note that you need to box up your bike.;
, A large portion of the Southwest is a desert. So if you go during summer, expect to deal with an average of 100ºF (or 38ºC). Winter temperatures can drop below freezing and you can even see snow in the desert! The windows between these two seasons may be the most pleasant.

, This is not as easy as it sounds. As there are only a few proper roads going across this region, you may actually need to use the interstates for certain stretches. It is legal to do this but do not try this in other states! Stretches of the Interstate that you can take include the I-10 and the I-8. Note that if you're cycling from California to Arizona and New Mexico, using Interstates is unavoidable.Some itineraries that might interest you include:


The Red Canyon, Utah, has a resurfaced cycle track on the highway running through the Canyon.New Mexico has a cycle ride called the Enchanted Circle. This is a loop of almost 100 miles (160 km) that starts and ends in Taos.If you're stopping off for some city life, Albuquerque, NM, has many trails and was named the third best place to bike in the US in 2006.US Route 66 has good back road options. Ride west from Williams, AZ along the Interstate for 20 miles (32 km), then head onto the remaining section of Old Route 66 between Seligman and Kingman. Take Oatman Road to Needles, another small part of the I-40, then back to Old Route 66 through Amboy to Barstow.Texas has the Davis Mountains Loop, 75 miles (121 km) with a gain of 3,000 feet (914.4 m) elevation as you travel. Amazing views!Arizona has the Mount Lemmon ride. It covers 28 miles (45 km) from the Sonoran desert and ascends 6,500 feet (1,981.2 m) to Mount Lemmon. You definitely need to take warm clothes on the trip.Nevada has the US 50 route. It goes for 45 miles (72 km) west to east from Pony Express Station to Austin, or continue to Eureka for a total of 58 miles (93 km).Oklahoma has the the Sulphur Loop, a 51 mile (82 km) tour., Make sure that you have all the equipment you need for your trip. Buy what you can at your starting point and buy what you can't before getting there. Some things you should consider taking with you include:


Puncture proof tubes (for the cacti and rough roads)
Clothing, including hats, sunglasses, bandanna, etc.

Sunscreen and bug repellent

First Aid kit
Maps, maybe GPS/compass, elevation and temperature indicator (usually a watch combination is best), etc.
Puncture kit, extra inner tubes, and other relevant spare parts
Sufficient food and water; use a suitable water holder that you can access easily while riding.

, This is especially important if you are frequenting highly touristed places or there aren't many lodgings available where you are going.


If you plan on camping, be sure to have the appropriate supplies and to update your outdoor knowledge, including treatment for snake bite and stings. Always check local regulations on camping before camping wherever you feel like!







, If you have never done such a long distance tour before, you are advised to train for it. The requirements for such training are not the subject of this article.

Select a helmet that is certified for bicycling.,
Select a helmet that fits.,
Check that the helmet sits down about halfway on your forehead.,
Try it on to make sure it fits properly.,
Select a helmet designed for your activity.,
Choose a helmet that is comfortable enough to be worn for your entire ride.,
Wear your helmet all the time when riding.",How to Choose a Bicycle Helmet," There are several standards for bicycle helmets including standards for many specific countries and internationally accepted standards. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) publishes standards for helmet safety for a variety of sport activities including bicycling, skateboarding, snowboarding, equestrian, and many others. The Snell Memorial Foundation publishes standard for a variety of sport actives that are internationally recognized.


From a consumer’s perspective ensure the helmet you are buying is certified to one of these standards. ​CPSC in the USA, Snell or other applicable standard outside the USA.
All certified helmets provide the minimal level of protection, even the lower cost helmets. More expensive helmets provide additional features and may be more comfortable, but do not provide additional safety.


The following is a list of a few of the cycling helmet standards from around the world. US Consumer Product Safety Commission (US) Safety Standard for Bicycle Helmets. Final Rule that took effect as U.S. law on March 10, 1999. (""CPSC"")
CEN European Standard Helmets for Pedal Cyclists and for Users of Skateboards and Roller Skates, EN1078, February, 1997. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (""Europe"").

Australia/New Zealand: AS/NZS 2063:2008—Bicycle helmets.;
, For the helmet to be effective it must fit properly. The helmet should fit tightly enough to prevent it from coming off your head in case of an impact while allowing comfort for long term use.

, In case of a forward fall, you want the helmet to hit the ground before your face. Do not cock the helmet back onto the back of your head.

, If you are not sure, seek help. Proper fit is very important to ensure the helmet works when you really need it.


Choose an adult helmet for adults, and a child's helmet for children. As children grow, be sure to constantly reassess the head size and move on to the next size as needed.

, Helmets come in a variety of styles, designed for different types of cycling. Road bike helmets are lightweight, while BMX helmets and mountain bike helmets may offer more protection and often include visors and more secure straps to keep the helmet properly positioned during extreme activities.

, If you do not wear the helmet, it will not protect you.


Check the chin straps to ensure they can be tightened enough to hold the helmet securely without digging into your chin or face.
Make sure the head bands and/or padding are comfortable.

, Even a low speed crash can cause considerable damage if you head meets the pavement or ground.

Compile your scouting report.",How to Win at Squash1," Study sports nutrition to learn the best foods to eat, and when, so that your body will have peak energy levels at match time. Without energy you simply cannot play at 100%, and in close games, you will need 100%. Drink water (hydrate) before the match. If you wait until match time, it will be too late.;
, Make sure your racquet and your strings are in good shape. Bring a back-up racquet of the exact model and the same strings.


Changing to a different racquet in the middle of a tournament will screw up your game.
Use a check-list so you don't forget anything you need.

Have the right equipment. When in a tournament, you don't want to find yourself without the proper shoes, socks, shirt or shorts.


, Squash is a sweaty game, and you'll want to have dry shirts available when you need them. Also, bring a towel to wipe off your sweat. Use a sweat resistant grip on your racquet, so it does not slip out of your hand.
, Being late will produce unnecessary stress. Get there in plenty of time to change, get familiar with the location, and use the toilet, etc.

, Figure out who your opponents will be. Maybe you know them already from earlier games. If not, maybe you can watch them playing. Ask other people about their playing styles and weaknesses.

Warm up.,
Start slow.,
Stick to your game.,
Watch the score.,
Never give up, even if the opponent leads by many points.,
There are no easy shots!,
Keep the ball in the game.,
Don't be greedy.,
If you find yourself running out of energy faster than your opponent, you are in trouble.",How to Win at Squash2," There is a five-minute time limit before the game. Hit 2-3 shots and then pass the ball. Don't keep the ball too long - it's considered rude. This is a good time, to observe your opponent, if you never played him. Every time you pass the ball, use a different shot, and see how he deals with it. You can judge his weak and strong shots before the match even started.

, Remember that squash is all about energy - the player who runs out of it first will lose. The goal is to wear your opponent down before your own energy runs out. If you find yourself in an uneven match in the first round: don't waste your energy on a match, you can't possible win. Chances are, you'll be in for a much more competitive game in the next round. If you're matched against a much weaker opponent, take it easy. Don't rush it. Use the easy game as a prolonged warm-up.

, In a closely-matched game, it gets down to preparation, battle plan, tactics, and nerves. Keep a cool mind and don't let the opponent force his game style upon you. You only need to win by two points.

, This will help you conserve energy. If you are five points ahead, you don't need to run after a well-placed stop. Let it be and conserve your energy for the next point. You still lead by four points. If the opponent is ahead, you need to fight for every single point to get even. Don't let him escape. With the new rule, where each point counts, it is very hard to overcome a five-point deficit if the opponent is playing at your level, and playing a steady game without errors.

, Many games turn around, because a player with a big lead, thinking he has already won, relaxes and thus lowers the pressure on you, waits for your mistakes without going for winners, hits loose balls, stops paying attention. On the other side, the opponent who has nothing to lose, goes into berserker mode, suddenly the game evens out at 10-10, and the nerves kick in. Remember: it's over when it's over, and never before. That's where the cool mind comes in. Concentrate on every single swing, on every single shot, always maintain a good body tension and light feet, even if you think it is an easy shot. Because...

, You can fail on the simplest of shots if you don't concentrate, and every unforced error is a free point to the opponent, and a potential point you missed. If you feel nervous and shaky, don't take risks. Go back to the basics and play it safe. Avoid loose shots, so your opponent can not attack you, play the shots and style you play best to get your confidence back on track.

, Don't try to score a point with each shot. Be patient and wait for an opportunity to attack a loose ball. Return the ball into the corners, keep it close to the walls, to force your opponent away from the ""T"", and get yourself on the ""T"" in a comfortable pace.

, The need to play a winner, to kill the ball, take highly risky shots, and put yourself in a bad position, usually comes when you get tired and desperately want to end a rally. Observe the state of your opponent. If he gets greedy and starts to attack a lot, plays a lot of stops, trying to end the point early, he is getting tired - unless that is his playing style from the start on. If you have an energy advantage, then exploit his tiredness, and make him even more tired. Speed up the game - make him run, but do not give him the opportunity to volley. Pass up opportunities to attack or to kill the ball in favor of extending the rallies to make your opponent run even more. He'll run out of air and have to stop running. If you don't give him a chance to catch his breath, you should win the match.

, Now you need to buy time, to catch your breath, and to get your heart rate down. Slow down the pace. Play long lobs to the back corners. If your opponent starts to hit hard and low, take out the speed and lob every ball. But be careful, don't allow him to volley it. Practice these shots - they are safe and very effective, but few players use them. These also have the effect of disturbing the pace of hard and fast hitting, aggressive players.

Test out different string lengths connecting the ball and paddle.",How to Play Paddleball1," Though normally thought of as a toy for children, attached-ball paddleballs are a great tool for sharpening your hand-eye coordination and getting comfortable with the paddle.


Hold the paddle in your dominant hand with your wrist facing up.
Flick your wrist upward to maneuver the ball to rest on top of the paddle.
Continue flicking your wrist to bounce the ball off the top of the paddle. Your goal is to continuously be able to bounce the ball on the paddle without the ball falling.;
, Try manipulating the paddle so that the ball alternates bouncing on the underside and the top of the paddle. This is just another way to practice your hand-eye control.

, Shorter paddleball strings make it easier to hit the ball, while longer ones make controlling the ball more difficult.

If you go to a squash club, you may be able to rent a racket, and balls, instead of buying one.
If you just want to try out the sport to see if you like it, you could use a different kind of racket, such as a tennis racket or a racquetball racket. However, if you decide that you would like to play more than once or twice, you should get an actual squash racket.;
, Squash balls come in different colors which signify their speed, yellow is super slow, green or white is slow, red is medium, and blue is fast.More experienced players use slower balls, so as a beginner you should get a faster one. This will help you to make the ball bounce easier.Squash balls are not sold in all sporting goods stores. You may have the most luck finding them online.

, Courts are located in dedicated squash clubs but also at some gyms and sports centers.Call the location you want to play at to make sure a court is available, as you may need to make a specific reservation to use it.


You will need to wear sneakers or tennis shoes that do not have dark soles inside a squash court. Dark soles are not allowed because of the marks they would make all over the court.
If you become highly interested in the sport and want to play on a regular basis, you could join a squash club if there is one near you.

, Squash is a game played with two players (although you can practice on your own). The game begins when one player serves the ball from the serving square. The server hits the ball against the far wall of the squash court so that it bounces back into the other half of the court, opposite the servers square.The goal for both players is to return the ball to the far wall, only allowing two bounces on the floor before hitting it. When returning the ball to the far wall, it can bounce off the the side walls of the court, but not the floor.The last person to successfully hit the wall during a volley wins a point.
You must hit the far wall of the court in between an upper line and a lower line, indicated on the wall. The bottom line has a strip of tin along it, so that you can hear when a ball hits it.

, A squash match is awarded to the player who wins the best of 3 or 5 games. Each game goes to 11 points, with the first player to reach 11, by at least two points, winning.If a player reaches 11 points but the other player has 10 points, for instance, then the game continues until one player gets ahead by two points.
Unlike in tennis, either player can gain a point on any play. All that matters is that the person who does not return the volley loses the point.
The player that earns each point follows their point by becoming, or continuing to be, the server.

, Position your hand so that there is a ""v"" between your thumb and pointer finger, but put the rest of the fingers close to the pointer finger. Grip your hand around the handle of the racket firmly but not so hard that your hand is stressed.

, Hit the ball against the wall, let it bounce on the floor, then hit it toward the far wall again. This may take lots of practice, since squash balls are not very bouncy. Keep trying!


You will want to practice trying to hit specific spots on the far wall. Try hitting the ball right below the upper out of bounds line and right above the lower out of bounds line. Having good aim will be important to getting good at squash.

, As soon as you learn the basics of hitting the ball, you can learn the uses for forehand and backhand strokes.


Forehand is when you hit the ball with the racket with your forearm facing the ball. This is the stoke that you have probably been using already when practicing.
Backhand is when you hit the ball with your forearm facing away from the ball. The backhand can be one handed but usually requires two hands on your racket. A backhand stroke takes a bit more practice to master but can be very useful when going after difficult to hit balls.

, While it is not required to play, more advanced players utilize the side walls of a squash court during play. In order to get the ball to the far wall, you can bounce it off the side walls first. Practice doing this, as it takes a lot of practice to get this move down right.

, Just knowing the rules of the game will not necessarily make you a winning player. As you develop your physical skills, you will also need to develop your tactical skills.


There are many different strategies that professional squash players recommend. Some stress the need for defense, while others swear that offense is the key to a winning game. Read about strategies online and then try to incorporate them into your games and practices. Pick what best suits your strengths and abilities.

, For instance, change up your shots so that you are not always hitting the same spot on the wall. You don't want your opponent to know where they will need to be to return your volley.


It is a good idea to change up your rhythm often as well.Take different intervals between when the ball hits the ball and you return it, so that your opponent will not be able to prepare far in advance for their return.

, Most players will tell you that winning squash requires making your opponent do the running.Try to stake your position at the center of the court, making your opponent move from side to side. If you have to move away from the ""T,"" the center of the court, then move back there quickly after you hit, so that you could move to either side of the court easily for your next hit.


While you need to make your opponent run, the rules dictate that you also need to get out of their way. If you are in the way when your opponent is trying to hit the ball, this is ruled ""interference.""If you or your opponent are hit by the ball, or a racket, playing stops. If the return would not have been good, the striker looses the point. If it would have been good, two different things can happen. If the ball would have hit the far wall directly, the striker gets the point. If the ball would have hit the side wall before hitting the back wall, then the players redo the point. This is called a ""let."", Find another person who wants to learn how to play, that way you will both be on the same level and neither person will get bored.


You may want to play on occasion with someone else who is better at the game than you. You will learn more about the game from a skilled player than from a beginner like you.
If you want to really get serious about squash, then take lessons. Your squash coach will play with you and teach you important techniques for becoming a better player.

Purchase a paddleball set containing a ball, two or four paddles, and a net.,
Get started by choosing a location on a beach or any other sandy location such as a playground or a beach volleyball court.,
Draw a rectangle in the sand with your heel or anything you have handy that measures 15 feet (4.6 m) by 48 feet (14.6 m) for a singles court or 26-1/4 feet by 52-1/2 feet for a doubles court.,
Put up your net across the center of the width of your court.,
Pick your teams.,
Learn to score.,
Establish which team will serve first by either flipping a coin or holding a volley war.,
Learn that only one serve is allowed per point, and only one hit is allowed to get the ball over the net.,
Remember that ""lets,"" balls that skim the net before going over the net, are in play just like any other hit.",How to Play Paddleball2," Each paddle should be a minimum of 18 1⁄2 inches (47.0 cm) long and no longer than 20 inches (50.8 cm).

, Paddleball can also be played on grass, concrete, or even snow if sand is not available.

, A singles court should be drawn when two teams composed of one person each are playing, and a double court should be used when two teams of two people each are playing.

, Though you can buy nets specifically for playing paddleball, you can also adapt any similar sports net you have as long as the top of your net is 5'10"" off of the ground on a hard surface such as grass, and 5'7"" off of the ground on a soft surface like sand or snow.

, First decide whether you want to play singles or doubles. If you are playing doubles, you might want to flip a coin to quickly and randomly choose partners.

, Paddleball scoring is the same as tennis scoring and is played in sets of 1, 3, or 5.


Tennis scoring begins with both teams at 0, also called love. One point is scored as 15, the second point for the same team is 30, and the third point awarded to the same team is 40. The serving team's score is called first. For example, if the serving team wins 3 points and the receiving team wins 2 points, the score would be 40-30.
Once a team reaches 40, that team wins the game if they win one more point. If the score gets to be 40-40, a situation referred to as deuce, the next point wins that game. Normal tennis scoring requires that either team must win two points in a row in order to win the game, but paddleball does not use advantage scoring.
Paddleball can be played in sets of 1, 3, or 5. One set is completed when a team has won 6 games, though they must win by a two-game margin. Therefore, 6-4 would be an acceptable set score, but 6-5 would not. If the second situation occurs, you continue to play games until one team wins the set by a two-game margin.

, A volley war simply consists of volleying the ball across the net between teams until a player misses. The team that misses will receive the serve first, while the team that didn't miss will serve first.

, Teammates may not ""double-hit"" the ball before it goes over the net.

, If a let occurs, continue to play normally.

"
"
Recognize that the basic goal of the game is to not let the ball hit the ground.,
Hit the ball away from your opponents, but be sure to keep it within the boundaries of the court.,
Keep the ball in play and be patient for an opportunity to hit an ""attack shot."",
Use a lob shot to gain yourself time if you are off-balance.,
Communicate verbally with your partner if playing doubles.",How to Play Paddleball3," You win points by forcing the other team to miss the ball and/or hit it into the net or the ground.

, Angling your shots away from your opponents makes it harder for them to return the ball.

, An ""attack shot"" might be a drop shot where the ball barely drops over the net, a sharp, hard volley, or a lob.

, Lob shots are balls hit high over the net in an upside-down U shape. Because it takes longer for these balls to reach the other side of the net, lob shots can be useful for buying time.


Make sure to hit the ball deep into the court when lobbing. If you hit the ball short, the other team can easily attack the ball with a hard overhead volley.

, Call out who will return questionable shots with phrases such as ""Mine!"" and ""I've got it!"" Establish what phrases you will use before beginning the match.

Once the ball has hit the front wall and has passed completely back over the service zone, the rally can begin.If your first serving attempt is a missed serve (swinging the racquet and missing the ball), a non-front wall serve (hitting any wall besides the front wall first), or a touched serve (hitting your opponent with the ball before it touches the ground), you’ll have one more chance to complete a successful serve before you lose the point.;
, Make sure to familiarize yourself with the several different types of faults that can potentially take place during a serve. Some of these faults include:


Foot fault: when a player steps outside of the service zone before the ball has crossed the line.
Short serve: when the ball hits the front wall but bounces off the floor before crossing the line.
Three-wall serve: this occurs when the ball hits the front wall but then bounces off of both side walls before hitting the ground.
Ceiling serve: when the ball hits the front wall and then bounces off of the ceiling.
Long serve: when the ball hits the front wall and bounces to hit the back wall before hitting the ground.
Screen serve: this is when the ball is served in such a way that it returns so close to the server that the other player(s) cannot see the ball., Rallying, which starts as soon as the ball is served, is when the two players make continuous shots back and forth at each other. During the rally, the ball can hit any walls, as long as it hits the front wall before it hits the floor and as long as it doesn’t hit the floor twice in a row., The rally continues until one player either makes a fault or is unsuccessful at making a shot. A rally can also be lost when a player switches racquet hands during a rally, carries or slings the ball with the racquet, touches the ball with their body, or causes the ball to leave the gallery. Once the rally is over, the winner of the point gets to serve to start the next rally., If at all possible, avoid getting between your opponent and the wall they’re aiming at. Also, when you’re hitting the ball, try not to aim it directly towards your opponent. In addition to putting yourself or your opponent in danger of getting an injury, these actions can result in the ball getting stopped by a body and therefore “hindering” the game. Depending on the circumstance, hindering either calls for a replay or a penalty., Whoever wins two out of three sets wins the racquetball game. The first two sets each consist of 15 points and the third set goes to 11. The first person to reach the required number of points wins that particular set., Hold the racquet the same way you would shake someone’s hand and then curl your fingers around it. There should be a slight space between your fingertips and the heel of your palm. Your fingers should be low on the handle without going off the edge. Avoid holding the racquet so that it is perpendicular to your arm as this will make it harder to serve.

, This is done by holding the racquet in the standard forehand grip and then turning the racquet roughly ⅛” clockwise. This is a difficult grip to master but gives the player a more powerful swing., Depending on your grip style, you will use the according stroke (or method of hitting the ball). Different strokes achieve different ball movements and should be used as is appropriate. The stance for both is similar: knees should be bent and loose, legs should be placed a shoulder-width apart, and torso should be parallel with the side walls.Forehand stroke. This should be done similar to a baseball swing, with one knee lowering to the ground but not touching. Remember to try to keep your swing level.
Backhand stroke. This stroke is done with the racquet beginning near your head, swinging forward around your body and ending behind you.

, For any given shot, it is important to understand the different heights at which a ball can be hit. Aiming low, just a few inches off the ground, is called a kill shot and often ends a rally. Aiming higher, one to two feet off the ground, is called a pass shot and is easier to achieve. A pass-kill shot is in between the other two types.

, A straight-in shot is when the player hits the ball directly at the front wall so that it bounces back parallel with the side wall. This is a very effective shot because it’s difficult to return. You can take this shot at any height., A cross-court shot is when the player hits the ball so that it bounces to the opposite corner from where the shot began. This shot can be taken at any height. The intended purpose is to move your opponent out of the center of the court., A pinch shot is taken low, preferably at kill shot level, and intended to end a rally. It is done by hitting the ball against the far end of the side wall and immediately bouncing off the front wall. Similar to a pinch shot, the splat shot is when a player hits the ball against the side wall (close to them, rather than at the far end as in a pinch shot) and it then hits the front wall in such a way that the opponent should not be able to follow. This is a low shot., A simple ceiling shot should be carefully aimed to hit the front wall before hitting the ceiling. This is a common defensive shot to move your opponent out of the center of the court., The farther away from your opponent you hit the ball, the more they’ll have to rush and run to get to it. This will give you the upper hand because it will tire your opponent out and also give them less time to set up for a strong return shot back to you., Try to stay near the middle of the court, close to the receiving line, in order to have quick access to all areas of the court.If you’re much closer to the front wall, then your opponent can use that against you and try to make the ball fall closer to the back wall. By staying centered, you can ensure that no area of the court is too far away for you to get to., When you’re returning the ball, try to hit it so that it will hit very close to a corner connecting two walls. Doing this might make the ball bounce off of the walls more and faster, quickly changing the angle at which your opponent needs to hit the ball., There are many different factors to consider when acquiring a racquetball racquet including grip size, weight distribution and frame material. You can spend anywhere between $20 and $200 on your racquet at a sporting goods store, depending on your preferences.

3 ⅝ grip size is great for people who wear XS-L gloves, while 3 ⅞ is better for those who wear XL gloves.
Less expensive frames are usually metal while more expensive ones contain other materials, such as graphite and titanium.
Even-balanced racquets are less expensive and and head heavy racquets are more expensive because they help you generate more power., While playing racquetball, you’ll need shoes that have good traction in order to change direction quickly. Wooden racquetball floors can be slick and slippery, so wearing athletic shoes made specifically for indoor courts is necessary for injury prevention as well as enhancing performance.You can purchase court shoes at a sporting goods store., It is very dangerous to play racquetball without protecting your eyes. Sometimes, the ball can be flying at 100 mph or faster, and if it happens to hit your eye going that fast it can cause substantial damage. Make sure to pick a pair of goggles that fit securely around your head. Consider getting vented goggles to keep steam from accumulating and impairing your vision.You can purchase athletic goggles at a sporting goods store., While they aren’t a required piece of equipment, gloves can definitely be beneficial to your racquetball playing. If you wear a glove on the hand you hold the racquet with, then you’ll have better grip and control that sweat may normally hinder. It can also keep you from getting blisters on your hands while you play.You can also purchase racquetball gloves at a sporting goods store."

Gather your bocce ball set.,
Choose your teams.,
Set up your game area, known as ""the court."",
Flip a coin or randomly decide which team gets to throw out the jack.,
Throw out the jack into a prescribed zone.,
After the jack is successfully thrown, throw out the first bocce ball.,
Let the second team bowl their bocce ball.,
Decide which team gets to continue bowling all their remaining bocce balls.,
Allow the team who hasn't completed their throws to bowl out.,
Measure which team's bocce is closest to the jack.,
Score one point for each ball from the winning team that is closer than the closest ball of the other team.,
Switch ends on the bocce court and play another frame.,
Continue playing until a team gets 12 points.",How to Play Bocce Ball," Standard bocce sets contain 8 colored balls — 4 balls each to a color, typically green and red — and one smaller ball, called the jack or pallino.


Different skill levels are often associated with different sizes of bocce balls. Smaller balls tend to be used by beginners and kids, while the larger ones are used by professionals. Regulation-sized bocce balls have a standard diameter of 107 mm (4.2 inches) and a standard weight of 920 g (~2 lbs).Standard bocce sets will run you at least $20, but if you're going to buy a professional set, you could need more than $100.;
, Bocce ball can be played by two single players pitted against one another, or by two teams with two, three, or four players each. Teams of 5 or more are not advisable, as fewer balls than players means that not everyone will get a chance to bowl.

, If you don't have a bocce court, you can always play in open space, although a defined court is preferred. A regulation court is a maximum 4m (13 feet) wide and a maximum 27.5m (90 feet) long, although any rectangular court measuring about 13'x90' should do.


Regulation bocce courts have a raised barrier around the edge of the rectangle. In most cases, this raised barrier measures a maximum of 20 cm (~8 in) high.
Mark a foul line, if not already given, beyond which players cannot step as they bowl a bocce ball.
Some players prefer to pound a regulator peg in the exact center of the court. This is the point beyond which the jack or pallino must pass when it is thrown out at the beginning of the game. This is one variation of how many people play bocce, although it is not standard.

, It doesn't much matter who gets to go first, as teams alternate throwing out the jack at the beginning of each new frame.

, The team that won the coin toss or was randomly selected to start gets two opportunities to throw the jack into a zone 5 m (~16 feet), which ends 2.5 m (~8 feet) from the endboard of the court. If the team that first throws the jack fails to get the jack into the prescribed zone, the second team gets to throw out the jack.


An alternate set of rules says that the jack need only travel past a regulator pin that marks the middle of court.
If you're not playing bocce on a court, feel free to throw the jack wherever, provided that it's far enough away from players so that gameplay doesn't become too easy.

, The team that threw out the jack is responsible for throwing out the first bocce ball. The aim is to get the bocce ball as close to the jack as possible. Players who throw out the bocce ball must stand behind the fault line, which is approximately 10 feet (3.0 m) above the bottom of the baseboard.


There are several ways to throw a bocce ball. Most tend to throw the bocce underhanded, with their palm cupping the underside of the ball, and either lobbing the ball higher into the air or bowling the ball from closer to the ground. Some, however, choose to throw the ball cupping it from the top instead of from the bottom, and lobbing it the same way they would have an underhand throw.

, The team which hasn't yet bowled gets a chance to now. One player from their team bowls, trying to get the ball as close to the jack as possible.

, The team whose bocce ball is farthest away from the jack now gets to bowl its remaining three bocce balls in succession, each time trying to get as close to the jack as possible. (Note: International rules always give the next bowl to the team farthest from the jack as opposed to the rules outlined here).


It is acceptable to hit the jack when bowling with a bocce. The only practical effect of hitting the jack is that is readjusts the nucleus of where you want to aim.
If the bocce ball is touching the jack, it's typically called a ""kiss"" or ""baci.""This throw is usually worth two points if the bocce ball remains touching the jack at the end of the frame.

, At the end of the frame, all 8 bocce balls should be clustered at various distances around the jack.

, After everyone is done tossing, the team that collects points is the team whose ball is closest to the jack. This team will collect one or more points, depending on the position of their other balls, while the other team won't score any.

, Depending on the rules you choose to use, bocce balls that are touching or ""kissing"" the jack at the end of play count as two points instead of one.


If the two teams balls are equal distance away from the jack, no points are awarded and another frame is played.

, At the end of each frame, tally the points. Start the next frame at the opposite end of the bocce court., Alternately, play until a team reaches either 15 or 21."

Reserve a racquetball court.,
Find 2 people to play the game with you.,
Designate any parts of the court as a ""hinder."",
Perform a coin toss or 2 to determine who will serve first, second and third.,
Serve the ball by bouncing it once against the ground and hitting it in mid-air.,
Return the ball by hitting it in the air after it crosses the receiving line or after 1 bounce.,
Return the ball if you are the server and 1 of the other opponents has returned the ball successfully.,
Play will continue until a player reaches 15 points.",How to Play Cut throat Racquetball," Many gyms and some public facilities have racquetball courts. A standard racquetball court is 20 feet (6 m) wide, 20 feet (6 m) tall and 40 feet (12 m) long, with a demarcated serving zone and receiving zone.;
, Make sure each player has eye guards, a racquet and suitable athletic shoes. They may also want to have flexible shorts, a short-sleeved shirt and a racquetball glove.


A racquetball glove is optional; however, it allows you to grip the racquet more easily.

, This means any part of the court that is considered out of bounds. The ball is dead when it hits this hinder.


Hinders are classified in 2 categories, either dead-ball hinders, when a ball goes out of bounds, as determined at the beginning of the game, and avoidable hinders, where a person makes a blunder. An avoidable hinder can result in a point for the server or change of server. After a dead-ball hinder, a rally is replayed.

, This person will take their place in the service zone, which is a thin horizontal box close to the front wall. The other 2 people will take their place behind the receiving line.

, The ball must hit the front wall and rebound behind the short line, the line at the back of the serving zone.


Any failed serve will result in an out and a switch in server. This includes a failure to hit the ball after it bounces, a serve outside of the service zone, incorrect movement after the serve or failure to hit the front wall.

, Either of the 2 receiving players can play the ball. It must be returned before the second bounce on the floor, and it must hit the front wall, or bounce off a side wall onto the front wall


A failure to return a serve in the proper manner will give a point to the server. Only the server can score points.

, The server will act as 1 team and the 2 opponents will act as another team for the duration of the rally.


If the server fails to return the ball on a rally, if there is an avoidable hinder or if there is a failed serve, the next server will take their turn. Servers will rotate in the correct order with failed serves, hinders or un-returned serves.

, Each player will keep track of their own points until they reach 15. A player wins the match after winning 2 games.


If a game is required to break a tie, it can be played until 11 points are reached, rather than 15.

Realize that there are 3 phases of speed.","How to Get Faster Reflexes for Racquetball, Tennis and Martial Arts1","


Reaction time: This is the perception of an attack, or rather the interval between stimulus and the beginning of response.
Response time: This is the time it takes to choose an appropriate response to the initiation of the actual movement.
Movement-speed: Quite simply, this is how quick your counter punch is or how fast your body moves getting out of the way of trouble, etc. You will notice some of these examples seem geared more towards martial arts and their methods of training, but not to worry, you’ll also see how they can be adapted to any sport

"
"
Run in the Woods: All that is needed is a little bit of nature, so go to a local park with a batch of thick untamed woods, shrubs, ditches, streams and other natural obstacles.,
Play Dodge Ball: To start, you need a partner to be a thrower.,
Solo Wall Bounce: Stand in front of a wall with any kind of ball that bounces.","How to Get Faster Reflexes for Racquetball, Tennis and Martial Arts2"," What makes this a good exercise is that you have to react with your body in very unpredictable ways, on uneven footing, while making cuts, ducks, jumps, bobs, & shuffling of the feet. The key to a successful session is to run fast! Yes, the faster you run the harder adapting will be. Interestingly enough, your mind will be so preoccupied with this live video game that you won’t even notice how winded you're getting! You can make this drill harder in a couple of simple ways:


Try putting on an eye patch. This creates a major deficit in depth perception.






Try this wearing sunglasses, giving you less distance vision in a shady wooded area.






Simply add ankle weights, that will throw off your innate sense of timing.





;
, You can switch up to make it fun and interesting for both of you. Begin at about 10 feet (3.0 m) apart and use a soft rubber or foam ball. Start slow, then as you get better, have the pitcher increase his velocity and get closer. Here’s a short list of some variables you should use to continually make dodgeball more challenging and fun:


Use multiple throwers.
Start with eyes closed and have the pitcher cue you before he throws.
Thrower can disguise his toss with ""feints.""
Color code balls: Red ball = catch, blue = dodge, green = strike. These force you to recognize as well as react.

, Throw and catch. Make this more difficult by: increasing your velocity, standing closer to the wall, progressing to smaller balls, switching catch/throw hands, and starting facing away from the wall, throwing the ball over your shoulder then turning around at the sound of it hitting the wall. You can buy a ""reaction"" ball that looks like an odd, uneven bouncing ball that can go in any given direction.

Balloon Kicks: This exercise is mostly a coordination builder.,
Side Shuffles: Here's one your football and basketball coaches wish they knew.,
Catch a Coin: Throw a coin in the air and try to catch it as fast as possible.","How to Get Faster Reflexes for Racquetball, Tennis and Martial Arts3"," It will improve timing, accuracy and responsiveness quickly without seeming tedious at all. Blow up a balloon and go into a room that has numerous natural obstacles like chairs, stools, counters, and coffee tables. If you’re so inclined, get some cones and small objects to clutter the floor, preferably nothing dangerous. Now, start kicking the balloon with the purpose of not letting it touch the floor. Kick, kick, kick! If it drops, you lose. Time yourself to see how long you can last each session.

, If you have access to a treadmill, you will make agility leaps and bounds. You are certainly going to look ridiculous doing this but that’s ok; the more embarrassing your training is the better it works! What you need to do is crank that machine up to 5 mph (8.0 km/h) to start and gallop sideways, trying to gradually increase the speed to your limit. Switch sides. Next, slow it back down to 5 mph (8.0 km/h) and try cross-stepping front and back. See what your threshold is in terms of mph. Your objective is a slight increase each session. Final set is backpedaling. Better start slower than the 5, this one's harder. The treadmill is necessary because it forces a pace. Next time some ball hog tries to take you on a dribble he’ll have another thing coming!

, This will improve you response/reaction time and speed. If you want it to be harder, throw two coins.

Play Video Games: This is a perfect way to enhance response action, and visual perception all while having fun!,
Peripheral Driver: Not much need to go into the importance of side vision awareness & expansion.,
Eye Accommodation: Or rather the ability for your eyes to quickly adjust from focusing on objects close to far.","How to Get Faster Reflexes for Racquetball, Tennis and Martial Arts4"," You don’t need to go out and purchase a $200 Xbox or a $250 PS3; a simple Game Boy to carry around for the next time you're waiting to renew your plates or visit the dentist is fine.

, Its usefulness carries over to every sports activity imaginable. You need to know if a potential defender or tackle is just out of your sight coming up the sides of your vision. Here is a great way to develop your P.V. while driving. Next time you’re on the road, try to be consciously aware when you catch a glimpse of a vehicle in the corner of your eye. Call out the color or make if you can. Gradually, you’ll be noticing them much sooner. The real trick is just remembering to practice it when you get in the car, so write it on the rear view with dry erase if you can.

, The ability to make rapid adjustments in depth perception is a skill that can be developed quickly & easily. This will play a key role in how well you can respond. If a fist is flying at your face, you need to be able to zoom in before you can gauge an appropriate counter move. Try these 2 simple drills once daily.


Hold a pen out at arm's length, and look across the room about 20 feet (6.1 m) away. Shift your focus from a far object, then back to the pen several times quickly. Rest and repeat, changing the proximity of the pen (closer to your face) every couple of sets. This is known as shifting.
The next drill is called figure 8’s. Hold your thumb up at arms length & begin moving it in yes, figure 8’s. While you’re doing this, also bring your thumb closer & further from the face as well as vary the speed at which your thumb moves every 10 seconds.

Decide how large you’d like your court to be.,
Measure the length and width of your court.,
Drive in stakes at the corners of the court.,
Dig out the court area.,
Install and link the wooden border.,
Lay a base of washed crushed stone.,
Lay a second layer of crushed stone or gravel.,
Place a layer of ground oyster shells if you’re building a regulation court.,
Lay sand as your top bocce court layer.,
Finish the court with artificial turf.",How to Build a Bocce Ball Court," A regulation-sized bocce ball court measures 13 ft by 91 ft (4 m by 28 m).Unless you’re planning to build a regulation-size bocce ball court, however, you can build the court any size you’d like. As a broad rule of thumb, the court’s ratio of width to length should be between 1:5 and 1:7.

Build a court that will suit the dimensions of your backyard (or wherever you decide to build the court). If you’re working with limited space, you could build a bocce court in as little space as 5 ft by 20 ft (1.5 m by 6 m).;
, Using a measuring tape, measure out the full length and width of your bocce court on the ground where you plan to build it. Keep in mind that you’ll need to add the dimensions for the backing material (e.g. the court frame) into your total width and length measurements.So, if you’re using 4x4 boards as your frame, you’ll need to add 8 inches (20 cm) to the length and width measurements.

For example, if you’re building a regulation-sized bocce court, you’ll need to measure the outer dimensions of the court to be 13 ft 8 inches by 91 ft 8 inches (4.2 m by 28 m).

, Once you’ve measured out the length and width of the court, use a hammer to drive a stake into the ground at each corner.These will serve as markers to indicate the size of the court, and indicate the area you’ll excavate.

You can purchase a handful of wooden or plastic stakes at your local hardware store. They should be relatively inexpensive, and do not need to be made of a high-quality material.

, The best way to flatten and level the area for your bocce court is by digging down about 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) into your soil. This will allow you to shovel out any rocks or clumps of soil that would disrupt the surface of the court, and will give you a pit to lay subsequent layers of the court.The bocce court will need to be built on a level area, otherwise the playing surface will be distorted. If you’re concerned that your bocce court may collect rainfall during wet months, dig down less than 4 inches (10 cm).

, Although you can use any wooden material you like for the borders, pressure-treated 4x4 boards work well. Lay the 4x4s along the edges of your excavated bocce pit, setting them end to end. Using a carpenter’s level, make sure that all boards are even with the ground. Then fasten each 4x4 board to the adjacent boards using 10-inch (25 cm) spikes.You can purchase all of the lumber you’ll need at a local hardware store. Plan ahead before you make your visit: if you’re building a regulation-size bocce court, and are buying 10-foot 3-meter) boards, you’ll need about 14 sections of wood.

, The base layer of your bocce court should be made of relatively large and stable stone. Use a shovel to lay a layer of 1-inch stone throughout the entire bocce court.If you’ve dug the court area 4 inches (10 cm) deep, plan to lay about a 2-inch (5 cm) layer of this large-stone material.

You can buy 1-inch washed crushed stone at a nearby hardware store or gardening center. If you’re having trouble finding the correct material, also try contacting a nearby rock quarry or gravel site.

, Once you have the 1-inch stone layer covering the entire excavated bocce pit, you can add the second layer. This layer should comprise smaller stones. There are no precise size requirements; gravel would work well, as would ½-inch crushed stone.Use your shovel blade to cover the entire bocce court with the gravel. The layer should be at least 1 inch (2 cm) thick.

As with the 1-inch washed crushed stone, you can purchase gravel or smaller crushed stones from a gravel site or landscaping company.

, If you’re planning to build a regulation bocce court (or have dreams of becoming a professional bocce ball player), you’ll need to top your court with processed oyster shell. The layer only needs to be about ¼-inch (0.6 cm) thick.This material is incredibly fine grained, and will not be damaged or disturbed by rain storms.Unless you live on the West coast of the United States (or in an international costal region), you’ll need to have your processed oyster shell shipped to your address.
You may be able to purchase ground oyster shells from a local landscaping company or from a feed and grain supplier. A small number of online retailers also sell and deliver ground oyster shell.

, If you’re not looking for a professional playing surface—and want to save some money—you can skip the processed oyster shells. A layer of ordinary sand will provide a suitable playing surface. Pour the sand at least ½-inch (1.2 cm) thick over the underlying layer of stones or gravel, and use a shovel to smooth the sand and press it into all corners of your bocce court.The primary disadvantage of sand is that it will become soggy and compacted following a rainstorm. You’ll need to rake the sand in order to help it dry and reduce its compactness.

, If you’d prefer not to play on processed oyster shells or on sand, you can lay artificial turf as the playing surface. This material is inexpensive and simple to maintain: it can be easily swept clean of twigs or debris.You can obtain artificial turf at a gardening center or plant nursery. Also contact your local hardware store or even a sporting-goods store to see if they can provide the artificial turf.
Depending on the size of your bocce court and the size of turf sections that you can purchase, you may need to buy several sections of turf.

Make sure that the 8-ball is in the center of the rack.,
Make sure the bottom corner balls are a stripe and a solid.,
Place all the other balls at random.,
Line the apex (the first ball) up with the middle diamond on the side of the pool table.,
Make sure that the balls are tightly packed together.,
Preserving the tightness of the rack, lift the rack from the balls.",How to Rack a Pool Table1," Sometimes called a triangle, the rack is the triangular frame used to tightly pack the balls together.;
, This is also called the ""apex"" of the rack.

, Make sure the 1-ball is at the apex, the 8-ball is in the middle of the rack, and both a stripe and solid are at the bottom corner, but line up all the other balls in random fashion. If solids and solids are together, or stripes and stripes, that's okay.


One variant of this step in amateur play is to vary the edges of the rack so that the pattern is stripe, solid, stripe, solid, etc. This will result in the two corner balls being the same, i.e. either both stripe or both solid.
Another variant of this step in amateur play is to order the balls down and from left to right, according to their number. This will always result in the 1-ball being at the apex, the 11 and 15 being at the bottom corners, and the 5-ball being in the 8's customary position.

, The center of the first ball should be in the middle of the table at one quarter of the length. Some tables have this spot marked with a small dot.

, A tight rack makes for an infinitely better break.

If possible, get a diamond-shaped rack for 9-ball.,
In all variants of 9-ball, keep the 1-ball at the apex and the 9-ball in the center.,
Place all other balls in random order around the 1- and 9-ball.",How to Rack a Pool Table2," Since the racking technique is different in 9-ball from 8-ball, a different rack is preferred. The pattern of a diamond is 1-2-3-2-1. The traditional triangular rack may be used for racking a 9-ball game, but it will produce a looser rack.

, The 1-ball is always at the front of the rack, and the 9-ball is always directly in the center.

, Like in 8-ball, traditional rules state that all other balls are placed randomly.


One amateur variant of 9-ball is that the billiard balls are placed in sequential orders, down and from left to right, excepting the 9-ball, which stays in the middle. If done properly, the 1-ball will be at the apex and the 8-ball will be at the bottom.

Play matches!","How to Become ""Squash Fit"""," Squash requires you have good cardio, and running is the most basic cardio workout that anyone can do. If running does not work for you, swimming is another alternative that is easy on the joints. You can also find many stationary cardio machines at your local gym (for example, elliptical or bike).;
, This does not mean eat less, and this is a common misconception of diets for athletes. You simply need to eat better. Carbs are good before exercise, but otherwise are stored as fat. The opposite goes for protein (protein is stored as fat unless it is helping muscles recover after exercise). These are just the basics, and there is much more you need to be informed of. You should basically just be knowledgeable of what you are putting into your body. Think of food for people like gas for cars: you can fill a car up with whatever type of gas you want, but if you want peak performance, you will fill it up with the best gas you can.

, Plyometrics are becoming a staple in all modern sports. In short, plyos are basically short, explosive burst exercises. Squash is a sport, especially now a days, that requires you push hard off the t as fast as you can repeatedly. Therefore, plyos are needed. Good exercises include short sprints, jumps, etc.

, While there are differing philosophies on what build is ideal for squash, one thing is certain: the faster and stronger you are, the better. In terms of upper body, you need to generate enough racket head speed to flick the ball with pace. This can be done through either exceptional technique or making your muscles stronger (which can be done through various ways, such as weightlifting or hours of hitting the ball hard). As far as lower body goes, biking and weightlifting help tons, along with the ploys as stated earlier. The key thing to remember is not to get too much muscle mass. If you become too big, you will become slow. The key is to keep your body strong in relation to it's size. For example, I know people who are 140 pounds but have very lean muscle, they are extremely mobile. On the other hand, I know people as heavy as 190 who can still storm around the court because they have ridiculous leg strength to push off with.

, Ghosting is a technique developed in which you are on court by yourself and practicing moving from the t to the 6 hotspots of the courts: the front left and right, the side left and right, and the back left and right. It is important that your movement is good so that you can be efficient and save energy as you are playing. Some people are so efficient that as a result, they can sacrifice a bit of fitness.

, Practicing moving and playing in real situations will only make you harder, better, faster, stronger!

In many versions of the game, pocketing the 8-ball on the break guarantees the breaker an automatic victory. However, if you pocket the 8-ball on the break and scratch the cue ball, you will automatically forfeit the game to your opponent., Determine if you or your opponent will be the breaker. If you have trouble deciding, flip a coin or play [Play Rock, Paper, Scissors|Rock, Paper, Scissors.

, Place the rack on the table, situating the rack’s apex on the foot spot, and position the balls correctly inside the triangle. For a standard game of eight-ball pool, the 1-ball is placed at the rack’s apex and the 8-ball is located in the center of the triangle. One bottom corner must contain a solid and the other corner must contain a stripe—the numbers on these two balls do not matter. All other balls are randomly placed within the rack.


Make sure the rack is tight--the balls should be close together.

, If you are right-handed, you may want to try breaking from the left side of the table. If you are left-handed you may want to try breaking from the right side of the table.Try shooting from both sides of the table to figure out what is the most comfortable option for you.

, The head string is a line that goes across the table, from side rail to side rail. The line connects the second diamonds on the head end and passes through the head spot, a point equidistant from both side rails.Pool tables have four rails, or sides: a head rail, a foot rail, and two side rails.
Pool tables are have two ends, the head end and the foot end.
Pool tables have three strings, or imaginary lines: the head string, the center string, and the foot string. These lines are never drawn on the table.
The head string is nearest the head rail. The area between the head rail and the head string is called the Kitchen. On the break, the cue ball may be placed anywhere within the kitchen or along the head string.
The center string connects the pockets on the side rails.
The foot string falls between the second diamond on the foot end. The foot string passes through the foot spot, a point that falls equidistant between the two side rails. The apex of the rack is placed on the foot string.
Each end has three diamonds.

, The cue ball’s exact placement depends upon the length of the table. If these placements aren’t working for you, try moving the cue ball along the side rail or towards the center of the table. Remember, the placement of the cue ball isn’t wrong if it works for you.


For a nine foot table, place the cue ball one ball’s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and three ball’s width from the head string (into the kitchen).
For an eight foot table, place the cue ball one ball’s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and two and one half ball’s width from the head string (into the kitchen).
For a seven foot table, place the cue ball one ball’s width away from the side rail you will be breaking from and two ball’s width from the head string (into the kitchen., Position your body, arms, and cue stick in line with the second ball on either side of the head ball. If you are breaking from the right, you will try to hit the second ball to the right of the head ball. If you are breaking from the left, you will try to hit the second ball to the left of the head ball.

, To sink the eight ball on the break, you need to apply english, or sidespin, to the cue ball. This is an advanced technique that affects the curve and throw of the cue ball. Imagine a clock face on the side of the cue ball facing you. If you are breaking from the right rail, use low left english—hit the cue ball at approximately 7:00. If you are breaking from the left rail use low right english—hit the cue ball at approximately 5:00.Mastering english requires a lot of practice. It is important to be patient while you work on developing this skill.
Some experts recommend hitting the cue ball at 6:00, while others suggest hitting the cue ball at 6:30 or 5:30.
Avoid hitting the head ball—it will cause the 8-ball to go in the wrong direction.

, The draw shot is ideal when applying lower right or left english. This stroke causes the cue ball to reverse its path back towards you after it hits a pool ball—in your case the second ball to the right or the left of the head ball. Keep your cue level, your grip loose, and follow through with the tip of the cue down. The amount of force required will vary from person to person. While professional players break at about 36 mph (58 km/h), it is possible to make the shot by breaking at half the speed. Experiment with different amounts of force and remember that what works for you may not work for other people.


This is an advanced stroke. Practice, practice, practice and be patient!
The follow through is what causes the cue ball to roll back to you.

, While the cue ball should come back towards you, the 8-ball should roll into the side pocket of the rail opposite of you.

Don't get discouraged.",How to Pot the Ball in Snooker," Though the game is played in casual settings like bars it has quite a few rules. If you aren't familiar with them, don't be afraid to ask a friend who is. You can also consult Billiards, a governing authority of snooker games.If asking a friend, try to have them demonstrate the rule and how it is applied rather than just verbally explaining it.
Seeing what a ""scratch"" is, for instance, is much more helpful than simply being told the rule.;
, Take your time choosing your target ball. Many players attempt difficult shots because they don't see a simpler one. The easiest shots are shots where the target ball is close to a hole, and your cue ball has a clear path to the target ball. Walking around the snooker table will help you get a better perspective and make sure you aren't missing any easy balls.


Be sure to use your dominant eye when trying to line up potential shots. When looking down the shaft of your cue stick with your dominant eye, you should be able to see a clear path through the cue ball and to the target ball.

, A completely straight shot in which the cup, target ball, and cue ball are all lined up is easy to aim for. To aim for indirect angles, imagine a straight line going from the cup and through your target ball. Aim your cue ball for the spot on the opposite side of the cup that the line goes through the target ball. Striking the target ball at that angle will direct it to the cup., After you have found your target, visualize the entire process before attempting it. Imagine your cue striking the cue ball, the cue ball striking the target ball, and the target ball falling into the cup. Allowing your mind to see success first will help your body follow through. , Position yourself behind the cue ball. If you are a right-handed player, your right foot should be behind you, directly opposite where the cue stick is aiming at the cue ball. Your left foot will be in front of you and at a comfortable angle that helps you to maintain balance. , Your front hand will create a ""bridge"" and provide your cue stick with balance as you drive through the shot. There are multiple ways to form a ""bridge"", and you will want to experiment until you find the one that works for you.The “open bridge” or “V bridge” rest the cue stick in the V formed by the bottom of your thumb and the top of your index finger.
The ""closed bridge"" involves letting the cue rest on your middle finger and wrapping your index finger around it to form a closed loop that the cue slides through.

, It is important to have a firm but relaxed grip. After you are leaning against the table and your aiming hand is 6-8 inches away from the cue ball, the forearm of your shooting hand should be at about a 90 degree angle from your cue. The cue stick will be positioned at 180 degree from the direction of your back foot.

, Now that you are positioned, you are ready to make the shot. Be sure to firmly drive the cue through the shot, as opposed to simply tapping the cue ball with your cue. Remember that your cue can’t rest on the snooker table as you’re shooting.


You can practice lining up your shot and starting your shooting motion if you'd like, just like a golfer lining up his putt.
If you do practice the shooting motion, be sure not to touch the cue ball!

, It is important to hold your position and keep your balance in the seconds after the shot. Failing to follow through will make it difficult for your body to remember the motion if you succeed - and correct the motion if you fail. Keep your feet firmly planted until the target ball is in the snooker hole. Being unable to keep your balance will point out a flaw in your stance or shot.
If you aren't able to keep your balance, reevaluate your stance and shooting motion.

, Snooker is only mastered with practice and patience. You may not make your shot the first few times, or the first few dozen times. Keep honing your skills.


Having someone there who can point out what you do wrong will speed the learning process.

Keep in shape.",How to Become a Squash Champ," Stroke the ball to the front wall with sufficient judgment to make it bounce at the back of the court behind the service box. The ball should never hit the back wall on the full or fail to hit the back wall, ideally after one bounce and die. Develop it, as a reflex action with practice, by hitting hard below the front wall service line, or soft above the service line. The objective is to confine your opponent to the back of the court, moving him out of the dominating position at the T.;
, Your opponent's options are reduced when you play in the back corner. Thirty feet away he can't attack and his swing is restricted. While playing a cross-court you should hit wide so that he cannot reply with a volley.

, As a routine, keep the ball straight, in the corners, along the sidewall (easier said than done). This will cause your opponent to move away from the T and hinder him from attacking or volleying. He will be on the defensive and there may be a possibility of a weak return.

, This will allow you to move and pick up your opponent's shot, be it a drop to front court or a shot to the backcourt. Generally take long strides to the ball, so the body is in the recommended position when playing the stroke, and can also recover quickly for the next rally. The player controlling the T will invariably control the point. Even after playing a drop or front wall boast you should move back to the T, to await your opponents stroke. Practice correct movements by on court shadow (ghosting) routines and shot specific drills.

, Some players find it hard to watch the ball, especially when the ball is hit behind the player, they just watch the front wall. Players also tend to lift their head to see their opponent's position, before playing their own stroke. Make it a practice to watch the ball until impact on your and your opponent's racket. This will give you the extra milliseconds to respond and can also avoid injuries of being accidentally hit by your opponent, their racket or ball., It sounds simple, but most players tend to play strokes mechanically without relation to their opponent's position. Strike a balance between trying to hit winners or just defending and returning every ball. Try to spot your opponents strengths and weaknesses by watching their previous matches and also during knock up. Use this info to frame your game plan. Move your opponent to all four corners and especially if they have a weaker side, which should be exploited.

, There is no perfect diet, as everyone has different needs and requirements. The best diet is one that provides adequate fuel and is balanced with nutrients in the required amounts. If you eat healthily, you will train harder, and be in better physical and mental condition. Water and proper hydration are very important. Unreplaced fluid losses can impair performance. Please drink water as required by your system during training and matches. Eat well during tournaments, preferably carbohydrates., Squash is a mental as well as a physical sport. Analyze your strengths and weaknesses and Try to improve upon them. Even if you do not have a coach take the advice of a friend. Also learn from the pros by studying their matches on TV or video for tips and traps. Check out the squash sites on the net.

, You have to be fit to play squash, not play squash to get fit. Balance your on and off season training with a mixture of flexibility, aerobic, anaerobic and strength training and conditioning. Training must be combined with appropriate diet and also provide adequate recovery periods for your body to rebuild and develop. Stick to your training schedule, avoid short, hectic training and concentrate on longer and systematic training to avoid injury and build up your body's reserves. Everyone needs a specific training program, dependent on your genetics, physical shape and training history. This will determine how much training you can do now and your body's response to the training. There are some top junior squash players in South Africa.

Know how to prepare for the serve---Serving is a very important part of tennis, and if one cannot serve the tennis ball in, their game will be greatly affected.,
Learn the grip for serving---The grip you hold your racket with, is a main factor that decides the power, spin, and accuracy of your serve.,
Know your own style of play---Knowing your style of play and what shots you prefer to hit over others, will set the basis of which type of serve you want.,
Realize which type of serve you want and stick to it---This is a big problem for many people currently playing tennis.,
Maintain the right form---Serving for a long period of time may allow a person to develop his own form.,
Jump and Sudden Burst---Jumping for your serve allows you to get a height advantage and further increase your chances of getting the ball inside the service box.,
Pronation---This is a difficult technique used by many people who want a decent serve.,
Serve---The most important serve of tennis is not the first, but the second.,
Condition and Practice---People with a strong serve normally require a lot of energy in order to keep up their serve throughout the match.,
Improve Your Mental Game---Missing the first serve does not mean anything.",How to Improve a Tennis Serve," This usually causes the server to become nervous and feel pressured on their service game. Bouncing the ball a few times and breathing in and out a couple times will help to calm down your nerves and for you to focus better on your serving.;
, Normally, the server would prefer a “continental grip”, which is a grip in which your right knuckle is lined up with the right edge of your racket and causes your racket to become a straight line to your arm. This would enable the server to serve accurately with control and power.

, Serving hard, will allow you to “serve and volley”, which is when the server runs up to the net after the serve is in. Others, who are baseline players, may feel more comfortable hitting ground-strokes, rather than being vicious at the net would most likely be satisfied with a top-spin, or softer serve. If your style of play does not match the style of your serve, you will be troubled and find yourself cornered in a one-sided match.

, Perhaps one day they feel as if they would like to learn a flat serve, while the second day, they want to learn a top-spin serve. The maximum number of serves the server should focus on, is only one at a time. If you work on more than one serve at a time, chances are that both types of serves will not be trained to their full potential, and you will be stuck with weak serves.

, But as a player takes a week or two off, they may start to forget their form. This will cause a problem in your serve, not only will it change the accuracy and power on the serve, but it will also break down your mental game.

, The sudden burst on the contact of the tennis ball will allow you to create a powerful spin and force on the ball, making it harder to return.

, This technique requires you to pronate your wrist downwards on the contact of the ball. This will add more power and spin on the ball, further increasing your chances of hitting the service box.

, The first serve is generally the point-starter and sets the tone for the point, but the second serve is usually the reserve serve, which often has an 80-90% chance of getting in. After missing the first serve, do not feel intimidated by the fact that you did not ace your opponent. You have to realize that the second serve requires you to hit the ball harder and swing your racket faster on the point of contact, because this will allow you to put more spin on the ball, increasing its chances of going in.

, To keep yourself from losing stamina during a match, you should condition yourself daily, and practice your serve over and over again to ensure that you will not get tired or disrupted by fatigue.

, A lot of players fail to realize the fact that after missing the first serve, they have another chance to get the serve in. When a player starts to doubt whether or not he can make the serve, this is the time where he will start to fault and keep faulting until he realizes his problems. Keeping yourself optimistic during your serve is one of the most important things to remember during a match. Losing because of doubts in your own game is unacceptable.

It is important to note that there are a few ways to cock a crossbow. This instructional shows the cocking process with a set of cocking ropes, which is the most common method.;
, This is crucial to correctly pulling back the bowstring. Put the middle of the cocking rope in the groove. This will tighten the cocking rope as you pull on the ropes.

, It is very important that one does this step, as this is what creates the tight tension that helps actually pull the bowstring back. All modern crossbows that employ the cocking rope method of cocking have this groove, as depicted here.

, Be sure the cocking ropes are on the bowstrings, one on either side of the barrel, with the hooks facing away from you.


For consistency in accuracy, mark the location on the bowstring where you place the cocking hooks with a marker. This will ensure that you put the hooks at the same spot every time, increasing consistency in accuracy. Be sure that the hooks are oriented correctly, with the open side of the hook facing outward.

, This will ensure that you are pulling both ends of the rope at the same time


Make sure you pull both cocking ropes at the same time. Failure to do so will cause inconsistency in accuracy, as well as it will be difficult to pull the bowstring back.

, Keep pulling until you hear 2-3 clicks. These sharp clicks indicate that your bowstring is cocked and in the ready position. At this point, it is important that you keep your finger off of the trigger, and the safety feature of your crossbow in the ""on"" position. This helps to ensure you do not accidentally pull the trigger of your bow.

, Place the odd colored fletching, in this case white, down in the barrel groove first. Failure to do so will cause damage to the bow, as the bolt would not be placed, or nocked, against the bowstring correctly.

, Most crossbows have a clip that helps to keep the bolt from sliding around.

,


Make sure, when the crossbow is off of safe, your finger is off of the trigger. This will prevent misfires and accidental discharge of the crossbow.

, Place your finger on the trigger, and squeeze the trigger as you exhale.


Be sure to not jerk the crossbow as you squeeze the trigger. This will decrease accuracy. Keep the crossbow aimed at your intended target.

,


If your crossbow has a scope on it, you may have to adjust the settings on the scope itself. For help with that, make sure you consult your scope's manufacturer.

, Place a bit of bowstring wax on the crossbow strings every few shots,m. This will ensure the strings do not dry out, as well as decrease the risk of bowstring breakage. Additionally, regular waxing will add to the life of your crossbow.

It's probable that you will need to buy at least more shuttlecocks of competition standard to ensure that there are enough new ones for the tournament. Ensure all the nets are in good condition and get new ones if needed. Have spare rackets in case players have breakages and need to use substitute rackets.

, Are people going to play according to existing teams or will you create teams specific to the tournament? If the winners are going to go on and play specific competitions elsewhere, be sure to read up on the rules for meeting any official requirements needed for such wins.


Form a seeding committee if you are going to organize teams yourself from the entrants. Allocate players according to their seed, right down to unknown quantities (place them randomly).
Use a computer program (badminton tournament software) to help you with teams, matches and other more complex arrangements required.
If you need to use uniforms, be sure to arrange these well in advance.

, In advance, make sure that court time is allocated according to the game length and no more. Someone will need to be given the task on the day of ensuring that each team is adhering to its allocated court time. A good rule of thumb is to allocate 20 minutes for a 21 point game and 15 minutes for a 15 point game;be sure to let the teams know about these limits at the beginning of the tournament for the day.


Be sure to have some super fit organizers willing to run around on the day of the tournament to take care of all logistics including keeping the flow moving, getting teams on and off courts on time, making use of courts that suddenly become free, etc. They may also need to act as impartial line judges on rare occasions when the teams cannot cooperate on a call.

, Will you provide food and drink or will you rely on what the venue already provides? And be sure that there are changing facilities available for all players.

, If you can't afford anything fancy, simple cardboard certificates with a rosette attached make an excellent and affordable award.

, Are all the nets, shuttlecocks, rackets and team lists with you? Is everything in perfect condition? Do you have the keys to the venue? Is someone arriving early to set up and be there when players start arriving early? Are the changing facilities ready for use? If catering, is the food and drink area properly set up?

Decide where to make your badminton court.,
Know if it's appropriate to put there.,
Set up the net.,
Make boundaries.,
Make the line in between the boxes.,
Adjust the net every few days.",How to Make a Backyard Badminton Court," If you have a small backyard, you don't have many options except putting it in the middle. But if you have a bigger space, you can put your badminton court anywhere. Here are some tips for wherever you choose:


If you are on the grass, mow the lawn. It's easier to play on short grass than higher grass. Don't mow it too short, but be sure that it can even be played on.
If you are on rubble, sand or dirt, make sure there aren't too many rocks to step on or anything. You don't want to be leaping the whole time.
If you are on cement or hard ground, make sure that you are in a place where it won't get too hot from the sun.;
, If it is right next to the neighbor's house, there is a high chance of the shuttlecock going over the fence. If there is a jungle gym in the way, it probably would make sense not to put it there.


Some things can just be moved out of the way. If there is a doghouse, for example, you might be able to just scoot it out of the way.
If you think you can play around the obstacles, you can certainly do that.

, Buy a net from the store and read the directions on setting it up. Get a good one that can withstand the rain and is strong enough to stay.


Stand up one side of the net up on a pole and use two strings (with a hook at the bottom) to hold it down. Do the same to the other side, and this is the standard way of setting it up. Read the instructions if you are still confused.

, The boundaries of the court are usually about 8 feet (2.4 m) up and 12 feet (3.7 m) across. Mark them by putting duct tape down or by using a stick/rock of some sort to mark it.

, When the shuttlecock is served, it must go past a certain line in order to count. Around half-way through the width of the court, make a line that will show where the birdie needs to pass. Then, facing the badminton net, make another line half-way through the court so that it looks like a giant grid. This second line shows the first player's side of the court and the second player's side of the court.

, After being up for a while, the net can begin to droop. Soon, the net won't be as high as it was, and it won't be the right height. Every few days, remember to take it down and then put it back up again, or just adjust it.

Serve diagonally.,
Be stationary.,
Stay inside the box.,
Hit the shuttle below the waist.,
Do not take more than five seconds to serve.",How to Play Badminton Doubles1," There are two service courts (as a whole there are four) on each side separated by a center line. The server must serve the shuttle, i.e., the ball, to the court that is diagonal to their court. For example, if you are standing on the left side of the court, from your perspective, you need to serve the ball to the right side of the court (or your opponent’s left court)., Some part of both feet must be touching the ground when you serve. In other words, one foot cannot be touching while the other is lifted. You can keep both feet in contact with the floor by standing on your tiptoes while you serve. However, you cannot drag a foot along the floor., While serving, you must stay inside your respective box. You are not allowed to touch or cross the boundary lines while you are serving. However, you may lean forward or sideways so that your racket is outside of the court lines.The receiver of the shot must also stay inside their respective box.

, When serving the shot, the shuttle must be below your waist at all times. Your waist is defined as the lowest part of your ribcage. Therefore, it is slightly higher than the line of your shorts.Feel for your lowest rib. The shuttle must be below this point when it comes into contact with the racket.

, Once the game begins, do not take more than five seconds to hit the shuttle. If you do, the referee might rule a fault.


While serving, you are not allowed to delay once you start to backswing the racket. In other words, there should be no delay between your backswing and forward swing; it should be one fluid motion."
"
Grip the racket in a handshake grip.,
Cup the shuttle with your off-hand.,
Hit the shuttle.",How to Play Badminton Doubles2," When gripping the racket, your hand should imitate the act of shaking someone’s hand. The head of the racket should be perpendicular to the floor when you hold the racket straight out in front of you., Hold the shuttle from your body at a comfortable distance. Your arm should be relaxed, i.e., not locked or stiff.At this point, your racket should be cocked back in order to generate momentum to hit the shuttle, as opposed to underneath the shuttle.
Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. Your dominant foot should be back. Also stand near the center line.

, With an underhand stroke, hit the bottom of the shuttle below your waist. Your arm should cross your body and end near your opposite shoulder on the follow-through.Remember to aim the shuttle toward the court that is diagonal from you.
For short serves, the trajectory should be flat. This will force your opponent to return high.
For long serves, the shuttle should travel high towards the back line. This will force your opponent to move back to return the shot.

"
"
Familiarize yourself with the court lines.,
Get into an attacking formation.,
Assume a defensive formation.",How to Play Badminton Doubles3," Double service courts are wider, but shorter than single service courts. The basic court lines for badminton doubles are:The center line. This is the line that runs perpendicular to the net and runs down the middle of each side. It separates the two service boxes.
The doubles side lines. These are the outermost lines that run perpendicular to the net.
The short service line. This is the line closest to the net, and runs parallel to the net. The line covers the width of the court.
The doubles long service line. This is the second to last line near the back of the court. It is parallel to the net, and spans the width of the court.

, An attacking formation is the ideal formation for you and your badminton teammate. An attacking formation is when one player is in the front of the court (usually the server assumes this position), and one player is in the back of the court, i.e., the defensive player. The defensive player usually stands right behind the setter.The setter, i.e., the front player, secures the net position by forcing their opponent to lift the ball. They also intercept a short defense or shot with a smash.
The defensive player, i.e., the back player, usually fires powerful shots, like smashes, from the back of the court.

, A defensive formation is when both players stand side by side covering their respective sides. It is the weaker formation of the two. It usually occurs when you or your teammate execute a high lift or high clear, which is a weak return. A high lift or high clear sets your opponents up to smash or net the ball, and thus, win a rally."
"
Force your opponent to do a high lift.,
Do a net kill if you are a front player.,
Communicate.",How to Play Badminton Doubles4," You can force your opponent to do a high lift by smashing the shuttle. The back player, i.e., the defensive player, usually carries out the smash. A smash shot travels downward toward your opponent’s court.Carry out a smash by adopting a forehand grip, i.e., the handshake grip. Raise both arms, and cock back you racket arm. Once the shuttle is at its highest point, swing the racket over your head, and hit the shuttle. Make sure to follow through with the swing. You also want to make sure you have good balance to get the most out of your swing., Front players usually employ net kills. To do a net kill correctly, you will need to change the position of your hand. You will also need to do a short swing as opposed to a larger swing.Place your thumb behind the badminton handle. Only the pad of your thumb should be touching the handle. Make sure your racket is up before the shuttle arrives so you can make a short swing. If not, you will most likely make a larger swing than necessary and accidentally hit the net (called a fault), or hit the shuttle into the net on your side. Before hitting the shuttle, make sure your racket is on top of the shuttle, and you have a tight grip. Then, hit the shuttle downwards., Talk with each other. The name doubles implies partnership. You should maintain an open line of communication with your partner. Try to be aware of where your partner is in the court at all times. This prevents you from having to look back, and getting hit by the shuttle. Good communication will also prevent both of you from rushing toward the shuttle at the same time.


For example, you can tell your partner what you plan to do before you start a rally. Tell them, “Hey, cover me, I think I am going to go for a smash on the next rally.”
If your in the back of the court you can tell your partner, “I’m covering the back left side, cover the front right side.”

Don't smash the shuttle every time.,
Always plan your next move.",How to Play Badminton Better," You should hit the round rubber centre, or the ""sweet spot"" of the shuttle every single time. You can practice this technique by looking right at the center of the shuttle when you hit an overhead shot you can have a point. You can also practice with your hands to try to get a feel for the shuttle.;
, To benefit from the speed and height generated by the shuttle, hit it at the top of its arc. This will allow you to shoot a killer overhead and to have more control over the position of the shuttle. Don't wait for the shuttle to come close to you, or it will be losing momentum and height.

, Don't get out of position after you hit the shuttle. Return to the middle of the back of the court. This will make it more difficult for your opponent to run you around and to hit the shuttle in a place that you can't reach. Standing in the middle of the court while moving your feet and preparing for the next shot will place you in the ""position of readiness."", Hitting the shuttle toward the back line takes precision and strength, and it will make your opponent have to shuffle backwards and hit the shuttle with a considerable amount of strength to return your shot. If you're not sure where to hit the shuttle next, and the back line is wide open, aim it there. At the beginning, aim the shuttle a bit before the back line so you don't commit a fault if it falls out of bounds behind the back line.

, Badminton is like squash -- success is all in the footwork. If you're flat-footed on the court, you won't be able to return your shots. Instead, stay on your toes, move your feet up and down as you wait to return a shot, and move your feet back and forth and side to side in tiny motions to position yourself to return the shot. Don't be lazy and reach out your hand too wide to try to return the shuttle -- instead, make tiny movements with your feet until the shuttle is in perfect position. There are some exercises you can do to help you practice:


Squat jump - Put both hands at your back, then bend your knees as low as you can. Then, jump as high as you can. Do this exercise in 10 reps. This exercise will make your knees and core stronger, so that in the match, you can make a perfect jumping smash.
Agility ladder - There are variety of exercise you can do with this equipment. It will not only help you to improve your footwork, it also helps you to improve your endurance as well.
Lunges - Some people hate to do this exercise, but this actually helps you to build muscle on your legs, especially your quad. I would recommend you guys to do 10 reps jump front lunges and also 10 reps side lunges. Make sure you make big lunges when you are doing it. This will help you to take the shuttle easily, especially on the front court. Do not forget to do it in right techniques as well.
Shadow footwork around the court (with or without shuttle) - Once you have mastered how to take the shuttle in every corner on the court. Get a partner or a coach to help you to point on a corner on the court, then perform the footwork towards the point that has been pointed by him/her.

, Whether you're playing singles or doubles, the short serve will catch your opponent off guard. He won't be expecting it, and may not be able to run up to return the serve in time. To hit the short serve, you shouldn't just hit the shuttle really lightly, or it will fall on your side of the court. Instead, hit it at a higher contact point and drop it closer to the racket instead of in front of the racket., In singles, hitting a long serve all the way to the back of the service line will throw your opponent off guard. He may be standing in front of the shuttle and can miss it completely, or he may not have enough power to return it. To hit a longer serve, let the shuttle fall in front of you as you swing your racket further back almost to your shoulder level so you generate more momentum before you swing forward and hit the shuttle., Always try to hit the shuttle.

, When you're playing a new opponent, whether it's at a competition or during a friendly game at a family outing, you should assess your opponent's game even while you're warming up. You should look for a few main things: if your opponent is more of an aggressive or defensive player, if his forehand or backhand is his dominant shot, and any weaknesses, such as slow footwork or weak drop shot returns, that you can exploit.

, Don't hit all of your shots to the same location of the court of your opponent will be able to predict your next move every time. Instead, mix things up by hitting a drop shot followed by a shot to the baseline, or by moving your opponent from the right to the left side of the court. Moving from the front to the back of the court is particularly tricky unless your opponent has very nimble feet.

, Many players are weaker on the backhand side, so try shooting toward your opponent's backhand and see if this makes your opponent return less shots. If so, continue to exploit your opponent's backhand.

, When you're up at the net, simply hit the shuttle short, just barely over to your opponent's side. This will make your opponent run and will catch him off guard. This is a great technique if your opponent is positioned near the back line. If your opponent knows that you are going to do a short shot, you need to flick the shuttle over the opponent or to another side and if you didn't did this, your opponent will fly the shuttle near the back line.

, If your opponent hits the shuttle straight at you, hit the shuttle in a different direction instead of hitting it right back at your opponent, where he will expect it to go. This will work especially well if the shuttle has generated a lot of momentum. If you're quick on your feet, you can change the direction of the shuttle and not give your opponent enough time to react to a fast-moving shuttle.

, If you have mastered the drop shot, then use it to make your opponent run all the way to the front of the court. Then return the next shot all the way to the back of the court. Not only will this force your opponent to be quick on his feet, but it will also catch him off guard. This is also a great way to tire your opponent.

, If you like staying near the net, serve short, hit drop shots, and do whatever you can to make sure that your opponent can't hit the shuttle to the back line. If you're more comfortable at the back line, then serve long and hit speedy long shots so your opponent doesn't have a chance to move you toward the net. Make the opponent lose all control as you play your style of game and maximize your strengths.

, This will make the shuttle spin and fall in an unpredictable direction. To slice your net shot, start the forward motion as you normally would, and then move the racket inward as you slice the racket perpendicular to the center of the birdie. Your opponent will be expecting you to hit the birdie directly forward, while it will actually spin cross court., To do this, slice the racket, or move it perpendicularly over the center of the shuttle when it's in the air. This will make the shuttle lose much of its momentum and quickly fall on the opponent's side near the net.

, Smashing is when you hit the shuttle with all of your strength at the top of its arc. Aim your free hand up toward the direction of the shuttle for precision, and then swing the racket over your head with the other racket, hitting the center of the birdie and smashing it down into the opponent's court. This is similar to serving in tennis.


When you're smashing the shuttle, aim is just as important as strength. Don't just blindly hit the shuttle as hard as you can -- you should try to aim it either as far away from your opponent as possible or right at your opponent's body so he will be caught off guard.

, Once you've mastered the standard smash, you can practice jumping up as you smash the shuttle. This will give you even more momentum and will make the shuttle fall into your opponent's court even faster. Just jump up a foot or two, aiming your chest and body in the direction that you want the shuttle to go, and smash it at the center of its arc.

, The smash should be used at a time when the shuttle is high in the air and you have plenty of time to approach -- it should end the point in your favor. If you smash the shuttle at every opportunity, you will tire your arms and will risk smashing it into the net at inopportune moments.

, A beginning player is just happy when he hits the shuttle over the net. An advanced player understands that a good game of badminton is like a game of chess -- you should always position your shot wisely so that you move your opponent to the exact place where you want him to be so you can hit the following shot. Always plan your next move and always think one step ahead of your opponent.

Stand with your left foot forwards and your right foot back.,
Bend your knee's at a 45 degree angle.,
You should angle your feet and body partially sideways-on to the server, instead of facing him.,
You should stand as far forwards as you can.",How to Stand During Badminton1," This way, if the opponent is opening a flick serve, you can easily return it without turning 180 degrees at full speed.;
, This can allow you to easily run or shuffle back if the shuttlecock goes behind you. If you allow either leg to be completely straight, then it will take longer to get moving also.

, This will help you push off backwards, especially towards the corner.

, Still, try to be able to play effective flick serve returns. If you cope easily with flick serves, then you’re standing too far back! Force yourself to move farther forwards.

"
"
Always ready your racket.,
As the same as flick serves, always BEND your knees.,
After hitting the shuttlecock, ALWAYS return to the middle.",How to Stand During Badminton2," This will allow you to strike the shuttlecock back at the opponent faster. Also, it will allow you to be better prepared for getting smashed or body-attacked.

, If you put your legs side by side, it will be virtually impossible to use the backwards chassés, hitches, and jumps effectively. Only put your legs side by side if you have to run or shuffle to the side.

, This will allow you to receive the return shot from the opponent more easily as you are closer to the middle.

The object is for you or your team to get to 21 points first. You score a point whenever you successfully serve the shuttlecock and your opposing team commits a fault, which means that the team fails to appropriately return the shuttlecock.To win each game, you must earn 21 points first, and win by two in the process. So, if both teams have a score of 20, one team must win by 22-20, and so on.
If you and your opponent cannot win by 2 and keep going until the score is 29-all, then the first team to score 30 points wins.
The first team to win two games wins the match. If the score is 1-1 in games, you must play a third deciding game.;
, The badminton court is 44 feet (13.4 m) long by 22 feet (6.7 m) wide. If you're playing singles, you play on the part that is 44 feet (13.4 m) long but only 20 feet (6.1 m) wide. The net should be positioned halfway across the court, at the 22 foot (6.7 m) mark, 5 feet (1.5 m) above the ground. When you're playing doubles, the extra 15 feet (1.5 m) on the left and right side of the court (the doubles sidelines) are considered fair game for serving and returning. Here's what else you need to know:Each side of the court has a right and left service court. The server of one team must serve from one service court to the service court diagonal from it.
When serving in singles, you can serve to the opponent's diagonal service box and the back singles line on that side of the course, but not to the wider doubles sideline.
When serving in doubles, the player can serve to the opposing team's diagonal service box, including the doubles sideline, but not the singles long service line.
So, for singles service, the receiving court is longer and narrow, and in doubles service, the court is wide and short.
After the shuttlecock is successfully served, each team's entire court becomes fair game. The shuttlecock just has to stay within the bounds of the doubles or singles court.

, Here's what you need to know before you start your badminton game, beyond the court information and the scoring rules:Toss a coin or have another contest to decide which team will be serving first and which side they will play on.
The first serve of a badminton game comes from the right half of the court to the court that is diagonally opposite that court. For the rest of the game, if you have an even number of points serve from the right, if you have an odd number of points, serve from the left.
If the serving side commits a fault, then the receiving side gets a point and the serve shifts to that side. If the serving team serves and the receiving side commits a fault, then the serving team moves from one service court to the other and continues to serve. There is a point scored after every serve (unlike in volleyball, for example).
In doubles, each team only has one ""service."" So, if one player on one team serves and faults, then the shuttle goes to a player on the other team, and so on.
When a receiving team wins a point and gets the serve, the team does not switch sides but serves from where they are standing. If they win the first service point, then the players switch positions from right to left.
After each game, opponents change ends of the court, and the side that won the previous game gets to serve at the start of the next game.

, There are several reasons that a team or player can earn a fault. Here they are:If the serving team fails to serve the shuttlecock over the net. In badminton, you only get one try on each serve. The only exception is if your team gets a let, which is when the shuttlecock hits the net and falls over into the opponent's court. In that case, you get another try.
If you hit the shuttlecock into or under the net at any point in the game.
If the shuttlecock hits you.
If you hit the shuttlecock out of bounds.
If you hit the shuttlecock on the ground on your side of the court.
If the server fails to serve the shuttlecock into the correct opposing court.

For more advanced players, you can also consider it a fault when the server hits the shuttlecock at a point that is higher than his waist, or when he holds the racket head higher than his hand.



, The standard badminton racket is 26 inches (66.0 cm) long and weights anywhere from 4.5-5.5 ounces. Most of them are made with metal and nylon, and you'll need to generate enough energy to effectively strike the shuttlecock with this light racket. The main strokes are the forehand and the backhand (as in tennis) and you'll need a light, quick wrist to effectively strike the shuttle. Here's what you need to know about striking the shuttlecock:It's all about the footwork. See the shuttle and use several small steps to position yourself so that you can easily strike it instead of having to stretch too much.
You'll need to practice the backswing, the forward swing and hit, and the follow through in order to hit the shuttle effectively. You should hit the shuttle's round center, not the feathers of the shuttle.
Perfect your clear shot. This is the most common shot and the goal is to strike the shuttle in a way that moves your opponent away from the net, which gives you time to set up your next shot.
Practice your drop shot. To hit this shot effectively, you'll have to hit a slow, gentle shot that makes the shuttle fall just over the net, making it hard to reach for your opponent, no matter how fast he runs.
Smash the shuttle. This is a powerful shot that you use to hit a shuttle that is above the height of the net. You'll need to raise you're racket behind your back, as if you were going to scratch it, anticipate the shuttle coming your way, and then hit it hard, diagonally down, as if you were smashing it over a fence.
Drive the shuttle. This can be a forehand or a backhand shot that makes the shuttle move parallel to the ground, just barely passing over the net, making it hard for your opponent to anticipate or return your shot.

, The grip is how you hold your racket and it will affect every stroke that you hit. You have two basic grips in the game, one for the forehand and one for the backhand. Here's what you need to know:The forehand grip. Hold the racket with your non-playing hand, pointing the handle toward you with your racket face perpendicular to the floor. Put your hand on the handle as if you are shaking hands with it. Look for a V shape between your thumb and index finger. Rest the handle loosely in your fingers for more flexibility. Shorten the grip and place it closer to the shaft for more control of the racket when you're hitting the shuttle from forecourt and midcourt.
The backhand grip. Hold the racket as if you were holding a forehand grip. Then, turn it counter-clockwise, so that the V shape you've formed moves to the left. Put your thumb against the back bevel of the handle for more leverage and power, resting the racket loosely in your fingers.

, There are many ways to hit a badminton serve, from the high serve to the backhand serve. Here are a few serves you will need to know:The high serve. This is a great serve for moving your opponent back during singles play; it's a little trickier for doubles. You have to use an underhanded forehand for this serve. Relax, bend your knees, standing 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) behind the short service line. Lead with your non-racket leg, placing your racket leg behind it. Move your racket back almost to your shoulder, then swing it forward. Hold the shuttle by the feathers and drop it slightly in front of you. Hit the shuttle with the flat face of your racket and follow through until your racket reaches all the way to the non-racket side of your head.
The low serve. This serve is more commonly used during doubles. You can use the forehand or the backhand for this motion.

For the forehand serve, stand 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) behind the service line, bring your racket back to your waist level and start swinging forward. Hold the shuttle by the feathers and bring it close to meet the racket instead of dropping it. Hit the shuttle at a higher point, but still below your waist, and push it with the racket face, trying to make it just skim the tape of the net.
For the backhand serve, just lead with your racket leg and your non-racket leg behind, with your feet pointing toward your opponent. Use a short backswing and then bring the racket forward, holding the shuttle at the tip of the feathers in front of waist level. Then, push the shuttle with the racket face and try to make it skim the tape of the net. Shorten your grip for more control.



, Here's what you need to know:The flick serve. Use this for a quick serve but do so sparingly. Use a forehand or a backhand, acting like you're going to push the shuttle in a typical low serve, but instead, use your wrist to quickly flick the shuttle over.
The drive serve. This is an attacking serve perfect for singles or doubles. This will make the shuttle travel at a flatter angle and at a faster pace. Use an underarm forehand, standing a bit further from the service line, leading with your non-racket leg, placing your racket a bit below waist level, bringing it back and parallel to your waist. Swing the racket forward and follow through as you drop the shuttle slightly sideways to your body, hitting it and letting it pass the net at a flatter angle.

, Once you see that the shuttle is coming low and in front of you, you'll need to hit that forehand to beat your opponent. Here's what you have to do:


Drop the racket head down and behind you. Make sure that the racket extends out behind you.
Keep your knees bent and ready to move.
Move forward with your racket foot.
Keep your arm nearly straight as you swing the racket, snapping your wrist at the last possible second before you hit the shuttle.
Have an open racket face and swing the racket upward to generate momentum. Follow through until your racket hits near your opposing shoulder.

, To hit a backhand, you have to wait for the shuttle to approach your backhand side. Here's what you do:


Move on your left foot and step your right foot around in front of your body (if you are right-handed and your backhand is on your left side, that is), making sure that your right shoulder faces the net.
Bend your right elbow and draw your right hand across your body to get ready to swing the racket, moving your weight to your back left foot, keeping your right foot loose and limber.
Shift your weight to your forward foot, straightening your elbow as you swing the racket forward until the racket face connects with the shuttle, following through to move the racket forward past your right shoulder.

, The slice can help slow down the shuttle or change its direction. This is a more advanced skill that will make it hard for your opponent to know where you're going or to be able to return the shuttle. Here's what you can do:Slice your net shots. Start the forward motion as usual and then move the racket inward as you slice it perpendicular to the center of the birdie, thus slicing the shuttle and making it spin cross court instead of moving forward, as your opponent would expect it to do.
Slice your drop shots. Just slice the racket, moving it perpendicular to the center of the shuttle when it's in the air. This will slow down the shuttle, making it quickly fall on the opponent's side near the net.

, Also known as a smash shot, this shot allows you to use your power and to hit the shuttle at the top of its arc. To do this, aim your free hand up near the shuttle, and then swing the racket over your head with your racket hand, smashing the center of the birdie before it falls, directing it down in your opponent's court.


Aiming is important here -- try to aim the shuttle in a place that will be hard for your opponent to reach.

, After you return their shot, return to the middle of the court, so if they hit it to your left or right, you have more time to react and run to their shot, and return it back. Stay on your toes, and slightly move left and right ,so your energy and momentum is still active and you can be ready to run for the next move.


This stance means that your feet should be even with your shoulders and parallel and your toes should be pointed toward the net.
Keep your knees bent slightly and your racket in your hand with your arm across the front of your body.
Don't stand as if you were just normally standing up, or your body will be far too stiff to move well.

, Be prepared to run up to the net, run cross court, back up all the way to the back service line, or to reach the shuttle from any position. The element of surprise is important here, too, so watch out for your opponent's tricks.

, The overhead smash is the most powerful shot in the game because it allows you to hit the shuttle as hard and fast as you can, making it as difficult as possible for your opponent to return your shot. Look for opportunities to hit this shot when the shuttle is being returned high in the air.

, Don't hit the shuttle right back to your opponent every time, or you'll just be making it easier for him or her to hit the shuttle right back. Your goal should be to move your opponent or opponents up and down the court or back and forth across the court so they get winded and tired and don't have the opportunity to properly return the shuttle.

, Don't just aim to hit the shuttle back and hope that your opponent messes up; have an idea of where you're going to hit it, how you're going to hit it, and why you're going to hit it a certain way. If you just blindly swing at the shuttle, you won't get very far.

, Though always aiming for the overhead is nice, or hitting mostly forehands cross-court because that's your best shot is a good idea, if you do the same thing every time, your opponents will begin to catch on pretty fast. It's important to keep the element of surprise going, so your opponents are likely to be caught off guard and won't quite ever know what to expect when they play against you.


This includes where you serve, which shots you prefer, and where you tend to hit the shuttle.

, If you want to win, then you have to make your opponent play your game and make him as uncomfortable as possible. If your opponent has a weak backhand (as most beginners tend to have), hit the shuttle repeatedly toward his backhand. If he's slow on his feet, move him around. If he loves to play near the net, hit your shots long and hard. If your opponent loves the smash shot, don't hit the shuttle in the air. Be attuned to your opponent's strengths and weaknesses so you can win as easily as possible.


It's important to observe your opponent closely. Whether you're starting a game or just rallying for fun, be on the lookout for your opponent's strengths and weaknesses as early as possible.

Improve your speed.,
Keep a bounce in your step.,
Take up yoga to improve your flexibility.,
Work on your backhand.,
Master the different types of serve.",How to Win at Badminton1," Getting around the court quickly is extremely important in badminton. If you really want to improve your game, you’ll need to train between games. Try jogging and walking weekly; it will keep you quick and your knees strong.You can play shadow badminton with a partner to improve your speed and footwork. Have a partner call out various points on the court (eg. “Left backcourt”). Move to that point as if in a real match. Work at this exercise for a few minutes then switch; you’ll see your speed improve.;
, If you're flat-footed on the court, you won't be able to return your opponent’s shots. Instead, stay on your toes, bouncing back and forth. This will make it easier to spring across the course. This bounce also gives you the ability to jump if you need to cross particularly large distances., You need good range of motion to get those hard to reach shots. Practice yoga at least once a week to improve this facet of your game. Besides flexibility, yoga can help you learn to better control your breathing, improving your overall cardiovascular performance., The first step to a proper backhand involves the right grip. The placement of the thumb is the main difference between the backhand and forehand grips. For the backhand grip, the thumb is placed upwards along the grip, pointed towards the head of the racquet.Start with your back towards the front of the court, keeping your eyes on the shuttlecock. This allows for a longer, more powerful backhand swing.
Keep your arm close to your body until it’s time to swing.
Swing your arm around, racquet aimed towards the shuttlecock.
Use a flick of your wrist to transfer the power of your swing to the shuttlecock.

, Each serves a different function, some driving your opponent back while others force them to play close to the net. Some are more aggressive while others are played defensively.


The low serve needs to be struck as gently as possible, barely passing over the net and aimed at the front of the opponent’s court.
The high serve is sent powerfully upward, so that it come at your opponent almost vertically. This serve is used to drive your opponent back.
The flick serve follows a similar upward trajectory as the high serve, but is not nearly as powerful. It’s meant to land behind your opponent’s starting position, forcing them to return the serve while backpedaling.
The drive serve is more of a gamble than the other types. It is struck quickly, low over the net. You aim to give your opponent the least amount of time to respond, in order to force them into a mistake. However, it’s possible they’ll return the serve accurately, and just as fast, forcing the same type of reaction out of you."
"
Understand your opponent.,
Force your opponent to run around the court.,
Always plan your next move.,
Make your opponent play your style of game.,
Don't allow yourself to become discouraged or complacent.",How to Win at Badminton2," When you're playing with a new opponent, whether it's at a competition or during a friendly game at a family outing, you should actively try to discover your opponent's weaknesses. Find out whether they play more aggressively or defensively. Look for weaknesses like slow footwork, weak drop shot returns or etc.

, Don't hit all of your shots to the same location of the court; this makes you predictable. Place your shots differently. Aim to confuse and tire your opponent.


If your opponent hits the shuttle straight at you or to the net, hit the shuttle in a different direction instead of hitting it right back at your opponent, where they will expect it to go.
You can use long shots to force your opponent to run around the court. Make sure you return to center after hitting your shots, this makes you better prepared to return shots while your opponent’s position is much less stable.

, A beginner is just happy when he hits the shuttle over the net. An advanced player understands that you should always position your shot wisely so that you move your opponent to the exact place where you want them to be so you can hit the following shot or smash them.


Always return to base after sending or returning a shot. This means returning to the center of the area you’re covering (your half of the court in singles)., If you like staying near the net, serve short and hit drop shots, do whatever you can to make sure that your opponent can't hit the shuttle to the back line. If you're more comfortable at the back line, serve long and hit speedy shots so your opponent doesn't have a chance to move you towards the net.

, If you lack confidence, you may hold yourself back and lose the match. Be especially careful not to let this happen against opponents close to your skill level. However, make sure you don’t get too confident.You might underestimate your opponent's ability and play below the level you should.

Choose between an oval or square-shaped racket head.,
Weigh your options.,
Check whether the tension of the string is tight or not.,
Get a grip.,
Think flexibility.,
Buy a racket that is made out of lightweight aluminum or steel.,
If you are unsure about which type of racket you prefer, buy one used but in good condition.",How to Buy a Badminton Racket," An oval racket tends to have more concentrated power while a square racket head has more surface area. Your choice in racket shape will greatly affect your game.;
, While a light racket gives the player swifter mobility, a heavier racket is more stable and can deliver more momentum if you know how to use it correctly.

, If you are a beginner, then 16-20 lbs will do. However, if you want to play professionally, then then the string tension should be 19-24/29lbs.

, Go to your local sporting-goods store and test out some rackets. Pay particular attention to grip size, and decide whether you prefer a smaller or larger grip. You want a racket that you can easily manipulate to generate swing speed and accuracy. If the grip feels to big, you can tire yourself out maintaining a hold on your racket.

, Go for a flexible shaft if you are a beginner. Advanced players or those with very fast swings should buy rackets that have as little give as possible.

, If you are thinking of playing professionally, purchase a carbon-fiber racket that is extremely light and aerodynamic.

, You can try several rackets without a large financial outlay and then upgrade when you find a model that works best.

Approach the shuttlecock with a forehand grip.Be on your toes and ready to return the shuttle with a smash at any instant.,
Assume a surefooted stance.,
Raise your arms and prepare to strike.,
Strike the shuttlecock.,
Follow through with your swing and recover for the next rally.",How to Smash in Badminton1," You never know when a smash-worthy shot will present itself. When the shuttle is hit to your end of the court, get underneath and behind it as quickly as possible.The sooner you reach the spot where the shuttle appears to be incoming, the higher it will be and the more time you’ll have to set up a killer smash.
You may hear serious badminton players call this kind of maneuver “injection of pace.” All this means is that you add a boost of speed so you have more time to react.;
, If the shuttle comes in hot, you might not have a lot of time to react. In ideal conditions, both of your feet will be pointing to the side of the court.Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, your knees slightly bent, and your eyes tracking the ball.Balance is more important at this point than winding up for your smash. If you’re not well-balanced, it’ll negatively impact your smash.

, Hold your racket upright and as far back as possible while still being comfortable. The arm of your non-racket hand should be bent at the elbow and the hand should be at about chin level.


The fingers of your non-racket hand can be positioned however you like. Curling your fingers into a fist is most popular, but you can leave them spread out, too.
As you prepare to strike, imagine the angle the shuttle will travel. It should be as steep downward as possible while still making it over the net.
Raising your non-racket hand will act as a counterbalance for your racket hand, providing greater stability for your smash., Aim to connect with the shuttle at the highest point possible. Inhale deeply before you swing and stretch out your non-racket arm so it's roughly shoulder level. Swing with your full racket-arm and exhale as you do so. As you swing, your racket foot should shuffle forward.

Power is important at this point, but even more important is hitting the shuttle with the center of the racket.
When you feel the racket come in contact with the shuttle, snap your wrist downward. This will add power and steepness to the stroke.You can increase the power of your smash by contracting your abs at the same time you swing at the shuttle., An overhead smash will be much more difficult for your opponent(s) to return. But in the event they manage to get it back over the net, you’ll need to be ready to send it right back."
"
Get under and behind the shuttlecock quickly.,
Prepare to jump.,
Jump to intercept the shuttle at the highest point you can reach.,
Smash the shuttle over the net.,
Follow through and stick the landing.",How to Smash in Badminton2," Getting to the shuttle quickly is even more important for a jumping smash. If you move too slowly, the shuttle will be too low for you to get the most out of this swing. Hold the racket in a forehand grip on the approach.An overhead smash is very similar in the beginning to a regular smash: your body and feet should face side-court and your stance should be firm.
The jumping smash will return the shuttle with greater power and at a steeper angle, making it even more difficult to return.Keep your body loose but ready. It’s common to tense your muscles when preparing to jump, but this can restrict your range of motion., While keeping your eyes on the shuttle, stretch back your racket arm as far as you can. Your non-racket arm will be about level with your ribs and bent at the elbow. Bend a little at the knees and lean forward slightly. All set? Now you’re ready to jump., Take a deep breath and drive downwards with your racket foot to jump into the air. Stretch out your non-racket arm so it’s above your head and off to your side to maintain balance while in the air.Timing is the key for a wicked jumping smash. In the best case scenario, you’ll be airborne and starting to swing at the highest point of your jump.
When going into the jump, your legs should be mostly straight. As you reach the intercept point, bend your legs backwards., Swing your racket forward to hit the shuttle and, as you do so, lower your non-racket arm to your side and straighten it at the elbow. Simultaneously, squeeze your abs as hard as you can and bring your racket foot forward a little.Envision a clear mental picture of the angle you want to send the shuttle on back over the net. This will help improve accuracy.
If you have not started far enough behind the shuttle, or if you’re too far behind it, you won’t be able to fully extend your arm as you swing. This will decrease the power of your smash., Continue the motion of your swing after hitting the shuttle until your arm is facing forward and mostly straight. As you approach the ground, bring your racket foot farther forward so you’re ready to land. Stabilize after landing and be ready to return the shuttle.


Jump smashes are most suitable on poor returns, where the shuttle is launched high toward the center of the court."
"
Choose your moment carefully.,
Position yourself to backhand smash.,
Crush the shuttle and get ready for the return.",How to Smash in Badminton3," The backhand smash is an advanced, offensive strike that is one of the most difficult shots to return.The backhand smash is ideal for returns that send the shuttle high but relatively short. This shot gives your opponent little chance to react.Because this stroke is a little more difficult, make sure you’ve gotten the hang of the backhand stroke before attempting it.
To perform a backhand smash, it’s especially important to be able to switch to a backhand grip quickly and naturally., Get underneath and slightly behind the shuttle, as you would normally. Switch to a backhand grip and point your body at the back of the court.The faster you are able to switch your grip, the more power this smash will have.

Opposite of most other smashes in badminton, to get the most devastating smash, you’ll need your racket arm as close to your body as possible.
Much like other smashes, your non-racket arm should act as a counterbalance for your racket arm throughout this stroke., This should be a smooth, complete motion that extends through the point of contact until your arm is roughly straight. Upon contact, snap your wrist quickly in a flicking motion. Avoid gripping your racket too tightly for the best control.

As your racket approaches the shuttle, imagine the angle that will take it over the net with as little clearance as possible.
It’s very easy to lose your balance when performing the backhand smash. Remember to use your non-racket arm to stabilize yourself."

Choose whether you are playing for fun or playing competitively.,
Dress for the match.,
Get a badminton set carry-all or bag.",How to Assemble a Badminton Set," This will make a difference as to the money you spend on your equipment:


For fun: Visit a large sports store, hardware store or even a pharmacy or supermarket. You're looking for a set that has already been put together for you, in a carry-case with a zip. These sets do not cost much and contain everything you will need for taking with you to parks, etc. They should consist of at least 2 badminton racquets, several shuttlecocks, a foldaway net with folding (telescopic) plastic or metallic poles with guy ropes that hold up the net.

For competition: Go to a qualified sports store or sports specialist for competition badminton equipment. To put a kit together, purchase at least the following:

2 badminton racquets. Racquets should be around $40-$100. Professional racquets will be more expensive than those used just for fun but they'll be of much higher quality. Buy at least two, in case one needs to be retired for repair, as frequently happens, or you need to loan one.
4 - 6 shuttlecocks. 4 - At least 2 packs of feather shuttlecocks. The shuttlecocks will be available separately, often packaged like tennis balls. They should be of high quality (Yonex, Victor, BK, etc.). There are also synthetic nylon plastic versions that last longer and withstand the forceful hitting. The heads should be made from cork, not plastic. (If you compete, you should not have to bring your own shuttlecocks but that depends on your club.)
Net. Unless you have to bring your own net, you shouldn't need your own net, as the indoor court usually provides this. If you do want your own net, be aware that the strongest nets have metallic poles (telescopic for easy packing) and guy ropes for pulling them taut. Also, ask if the net is for all-weather, so that it can withstand both sun and rain damage if you're playing on an outdoors court.
Pre-measured boundary. If you're not going to a court already set up for badminton, consider purchasing a pre-measured boundary which you can lay down over the floor of the place you're playing at. Ask at the sports store or specialist.

;
, If you're playing professionally, wear suitable sports clothing. Tennis gear is great, as is gear worn for playing ball games. There must be sufficient flexibility and comfort in your clothing as badminton is a very physical sport requiring you to dash around the court a lot. Suitable shoes include gym shoes and sneakers, as long as they are supportive and have soft soles.

, If you buy your items separately, ask if the store also sells a badminton case for carrying everything in. This will make transporting your gear a lot easier and you'll be less likely to lose anything.


If you play for fun only, buy the Yonex or Victor ones for their excellent quality.

Assume the low serve position.,
Start with a gentle backswing.,
Use your wrist to flick the shuttle.,
Complete the follow-through.",How to Hit a Flick Serve in Badminton," The flick serve is best used when your opponent is rushing you and you’re under pressure. It works especially well in doubles games. However, keep in mind that a flick serve can leave you vulnerable if your opponent can tell that it’s coming. That’s why it’s best to use it only occasionally.The flick serve can be difficult for beginners to pull off. It’s best used by intermediate and advanced badminton players.
You can use the flick serve with either a forehand or backhand serve.;
, The effectiveness of a flick serve depends on catching your opponents off-guard. If they’re expecting it, it presents them with an ideal opportunity to attack. To prevent them from figuring out your intentions, you must make your flick serve preparation look just like your preparation for a low serve.When you’re playing a flick serve, the goal is to make your opponent think you’re using a low serve until you actually hit it.

, Because you want your opponent to think you’re playing the low serve so you can surprise them with the flick serve, it’s important to ensure that you’ve mastered the low serve. Try to hit the shuttle so it just barely clears the net and lands as close to the court’s service line as possible. By keeping the shuttle low and the serve short, it makes it more difficult for your opponent to hit it back for an attacking return.Start the low serve by standing as close to the service line as you can without touching it. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, and your non-dominant foot should be in front so it’s closest to the net. Both feet should remain on the floor when you hit the shuttle.
Hold the shuttle at waist level, and swing your racket back with your wrist and hand cocked. Move the racket down and forward to hit the shuttle near your thigh.
Don’t move your wrist too much because the goal is to push the shuttle over the net instead of hitting so you keep its movement short.
When you play the low serve, the shuttle must at least touch the service line. If it doesn’t, the serve won’t count.

, When you’re readying yourself for a flick serve, use the basic badminton grip on your racket, also known as the handshake grip. Hold the racket in front of you with your non-playing hand. For example, if you’re a right-handed player, you should hold it in your left hand. The racket strings should face sideways, not toward the ceiling or floor.Don’t hold the racket too tight. You want a relaxed, loose grip, with your thumb and forefinger creating a V-shape around the handle.
Make sure that you’re holding the racket near the bottom of the handle.

, While having the proper grip on your racket is very important, holding the shuttle in the right way is also key in pulling off a successful flick serve. Grip the shuttle by its feathers, but cradle it with your fingers so you’re not holding it too tightly. Place it against the racket’s strings. Because you’re holding the racket with your non-playing hand, you should cradle the shuttle with your dominant hand.

, For a successful flick serve, you must convince your opponent that you’re planning a low serve. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Your non-dominant foot should be in front, as close to the service line as possible without standing on it. Be sure that you’re holding the shuttle at your waist.You may want to practice moving into low serve position in preparation for a flick serve in front of a teammate, coach, or friend, so they can look to see if you have any tells that might give away that you’re planning a flick serve. Work to get rid of any gestures or ticks that will alert the opposition.

, In order to generate power for the serve, you must shift your weight to your dominant foot. However, to fool your opponent, it’s important to bring your racket back in a slow, steady motion, just as you would for a normal low serve.Make sure that to keep your grip on the racket relaxed as you move it for the backswing. That can help keep the motion slow and gentle.

, As you bring the racket forward to hit the shuttle, you must suddenly increase the speed so your opponent doesn’t recognize the flick serve until the last moment. With your wrist and forearm, generate enough power to flick or snap the shuttle over your opponent so they don’t have a chance to hit it back.As you flick the shuttle, you should rotate both your shoulders and hips so they’re facing your opponent.
When you’re just about to flick the shuttle, try to tighten your grip on the racket. Press your thumb against the back of the handle to make sure you’re holding it tightly enough.

, After you flick the shuttle with the goal of lifting it over your opponent, make sure to finish your swing’s follow-through. Your follow-through should mimic the line of the shuttle, so you’re ready to defend against a possible return from your opponent.After the follow-through, keep both of your arms up so you’re ready to defend.

Continue to mix it up.",How to Serve a Tennis Ball," Before you begin to serve the ball, you have to stand behind the baseline, on the side opposite the service box where you'll be serving. You should stand sideways, pointing your left foot to the opposite post of the net, with your right foot being parallel to the court. For singles, stand close to the center mark. For doubles, stand farther toward one side, depending on what type of serve you plan to execute and the strategy you and your partner have planned.









If you're serving toward your opponent's right service box, you should be standing on the right side (deuce side) of your court.
If you're serving toward your opponent's left service box, then you should be standing on the left side (add side) of your court.
Your right shoulder should always be pointed in the direction of the service box where you are serving.
You get two chances to serve the ball into the opposite service box. If you miss both times, that is considered a double fault and you should move to serve to the other service box. If your ball hits the net and drops into the service box, that is considered a let and you can replay the serve; you can have an unlimited amount of lets, though this does not happen very often.
These instructions for serving are for right-handed players. If you're a lefty -- which happens to be a huge advantage in the game of tennis -- just use the opposite hands and feet.;
, Grip the ball lightly toward the fingertips rather than in the palm. Bring your ball hand toward your racket to help line up the serve and shift your weight slightly forward. Remember that before you toss the ball, you should bounce it at least 2-4 times to get into the rhythm of serving and to get a feel for the court.









For a flat serve, you should hold the tennis racket using a Continental grip. For this grip, you should hold the racket perpendicular to the ground, with your pointer finger along the first bevel of the racket, so that your thumb and index finger make a ""V"" shape when you look down at your hand.
Many new players try to grip the racket as tightly and as hard as they can. This should not be the case, especially not when you serve. Keeping your grip more relaxed -- about a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the loosest -- will give your serve more power and fluidity.

, You should toss the ball high up in the air, a little bit in front of you, so you have momentum when you serve the ball; remember that you can ""fall in"" to the court after you make contact with the ball, so it's okay to toss the ball in front of you. You can also practice your toss several times to find the optimal serving point; a great toss can be the key to an amazing serve, and a bad toss will ruin a serve more often than not.









Before you toss the ball, bring the ball to the flat racket face in front of you.
Drop your racquet head downward while shifting your weight back and bring your racquet behind you in an arc-like motion.
At the same time, begin to toss the ball slightly in front of you toward the court. This can be done slowly and deliberately. When tossing, remember that you are not throwing the ball; you should just let go of the ball when it is at the top. Imagine you're placing the ball up on a shelf.
The ball should be just a bit higher than you can reach with your racquet. In order to have the highest chance of hitting the ball you need to throw it straight up, or slightly toward the net without spin.
After you release the ball with your hand, you can keep it up or above you for guidance and stability.

, Most beginners just kind of raise their racket in the air slightly behind them and then go after the ball. Not you! For optimal success, you should bring the racquet head up above behind you and bend your elbow so as to drop it behind your head, as if you were to scratch your back with the side of your racket. Bend your knees to help project the racquet head upwards; it will give the ball more power.









Once you get good at it, you'll have this down as one fluid motion -- tossing the ball up with one hand while ""scratching your back"" with your racket with the other. Practice the toss along with this motion as much as you want before actually hitting the ball (just not during a game, or you will try your opponent's patience.).
You will see that some beginners like to lift the racket up behind their back before they toss the ball. Though this will make it easier to hit the ball, in some ways, you will generate much less power and momentum this way.
As you release the ball you're tossing, load your back knee by forcing most of your weight onto your back leg. You can bend both of your knees but focus on having most of your weight in your back leg so you can use it to spring forward when you make contact.

, Bring the racquet head up to hit the ball with as much speed as you can while keeping control. Your shoulders will rotate similarly to how they would if they were throwing a ball. Don't try to hit as hard as you can; instead try to be fluid. Make sure you pronate your wrist so the ball is hit with the racquet face, right in the center of the racquet. Pronation is necessary in every type of serve, including flat, slice, topspin, twist, and topspin-slice.









If you hit the ball off-center, you won't have as much control over where it will land. If you hit the ball with the frame of the racket, then 9 times out of 10, it won't land in the service box.

, To optimize your shots, you should hit the ball at the highest point that you can reasonably hit it at after you toss it. The higher the ball, the more easily you'll be able to generate speed, and the more likely it will be to clear the net. Think of it like this: someone is tossing a ball up high over a fence right in front of you, and you have to hit the ball not just over the fence but over the fence so it bounces on the ground as quickly as possible; this snapping motion will allow you to hit the ball in an arc, instead of a straight line, giving it as much power as possible.









Many beginners toss the ball far too low, just over their heads, and then strain their whole bodies to get the ball to fall into the other service box. Though this can be done, it's an unwieldy shot and won't give you the best results.

, At the end of the contact with the ball, snap your wrist downward to get the ball in the best position. Transfer the weight from your back leg onto your front leg to propel the ball forward. You may even end the serve with your right (or dominant) leg lifted off the ground.








, The follow-through as you finish the serve should naturally cause you to step forward into the court. Be prepared for the ball to come back. Always look at the ball. Never look at the opponent. This way, you can anticipate where the ball is going to fall and react quicker. Remember that footwork is absolutely key in your reactions to the ball; take hundreds of tiny baby steps to get you to the optimal position you need to be in to hit the ball if it is returned to you. And if your opponent cannot return the serve, then well done!








, Your feet can not cross the service line until after you have made contact with the ball for it to be a legal serve. Your goal is to get the ball in or touching the lines of the service box diagonally to the side of the center mark from where you're standing.









It's good to get into this habit even though refs or opposing players rarely call a ""foot fault"" during play. There was the exception of Serena Williams, who was penalized for a foot fault in the 2011 US Open women's semi-final, which caused her to basically lose the match!, Start adding power to the serve by increasing the racquet head speed, as well as using your leg strength to attack the ball. The serve is often the hardest stroke to master in tennis, so don't give up; be patient and keep practicing! Whether you're practicing with a coach or on your own, take an entire bucket of balls to one side of the court and practice getting into the grove with your serve. If you develop a killer serve, you'll be a tough opponent to beat; and on the other side of the coin, if you have a weak serve, it'll be hard to dominate a game.








, Once you've mastered the flat serve, you can learn to start thinking about where you'll be hitting your serve within your opponent's court. If you always hit the serve in the middle of the service box, close to the center of the court (""down the line""), or off to the far side of the box, then your opponent will know where your serve will land and will be prepared to go there and to strike back in advance. That's why you've got to keep your opponent guessing by hitting the ball in different parts of the court; use your feet and shoulders to help land the ball in different parts of the service box.


You can also look out to see if your opponent has a weaker forehand or backhand. Typically, many beginners really struggle with the backhand. If you find a weakness, try to land your serves in the part of the service box that will force your opponent to use his or her weaker stroke.

, The slice serve is a deadly (and more advanced) serve that is perfect for stopping the ball or making it change direction once it hits your opponent's service box. The slice serve is guaranteed to surprise your opponent and to make it more difficult for your opponent to return the serve. Here's what you do:Move farther away from the middle of the baseline to get a better angle. Stand halfway between the middle of the court and the sideline.
Continue to use the Continental grip.
Toss the ball in front of you and a little bit to the right.
Picture yourself hitting the ball from left to right. This would be like hitting the ball from 9 to 3, if there was a clock drawn on the ball.
Move forward with the edge of the racket going forward.
Rotate your shoulders so you face your body toward the target.
Make contact with the ball, brushing the back of the ball toward your dominant side. Strike the ball laterally on your dominant side. For a righty, hitting a side spin slice will make the ball curve to the left.

, The kick serve is achieved by tossing the ball over your head and then hitting the ball laterally on your non-dominant side. The motion brushes the ball upward, toward your dominant side, and will make the ball clear the net in a high arc with a heavy topspin, making the ball dive down into the service box and then bounce up high, making it quite difficult to return. This type of serve is used more as a novelty, and can be a great trick for surprising your opponents. Here's what you do:


Toss the ball behind your head instead of in front of it.
Bend your knees, bringing your hips forward.
Spring toward the ball while keeping your hitting elbow and head up.
Brush the back of the ball with fast racket-head speed.
Uncoil at the very top of your swing.
Follow through.

, This serve is an even more extreme version of the kick serve, which requires you to brush the ball from its 7-8 o'clock position to the 1-2 o'clock position. You should also swing the racket even faster than you would during the kick serve. If you do this correctly, you can change the direction of the ball completely, though it requires a lot of skill and flexibility.

, Though the underhand serve is not used in professional or any competitive tennis play (except very rarely when your opponent is tired or feeling sneaky), this is a great serve to use for beginners and children because it's easier to get the ball to clear the next and to land in the service box and to begin play. Here's how you do the underhand serve:


Position your feet parallel to the baseline.
Hold the ball with your non-dominant hand.
Hold out your racket with your dominant hand, so the ball is parallel to the racket face.
Move your racket back behind you, as if you were to hit a forehand.
Drop the ball and make contact with the ball just as it falls, serving it over the net as if you were hitting a regular forehand shot.

, You don't have to only hit a flat serve or a slice serve. If you want to keep your opponent guessing, then mix it up. Hit flat serves for an entire game, and then suddenly bust out a slice serve for the next few points. Or serve only the slice serve, and suddenly shock your opponent with a kick serve. If your opponent gets too settled in a routine or you feel like your serves just aren't having their intended effect, then make sure you're not becoming too predictable. And remember that the more skilled you are at serving, the more likely you are to dominate a game of tennis!

"
"
Learn to stand squarely.,
Use a Continental or Full Eastern backhand for the grip.

,
Start your backswing, bring it back, then up.,
Swing forward and down (simultaneously).,
Contact: The contact with the ball should be a foot away from your front shoulder.

,
End being somewhat square.",How to Slice Backhand in Tennis," To do this, imagine a line from your back foot to your front foot, and it runs parallel to the sideline.;
,, Use your secondary hand to hold the throat (top of the grip) of the racquet. Let go of your secondary hand when you swing.

, The more you swing down, the more you should tilt your racquet up, so it can clear the net. Also, lean forward for more power. If you don't lean forward the ball will drop into the net.

,, After finishing the swing, your hips and and feet should be a bit square. A hard hit would make your shoulders almost face the net.

Make sure you eat a healthy breakfast but try not to eat anything too heavy.,
Make sure to arrive at the the least half an hour before the tournament starts to warm up your strokes.,
When you face your first opponent, warm up your strokes and serves with them so that you can develop a profile of how they play and use that to your advantage.

"
A right handed player should hold the tennis ball in their left hand and grip the tennis racquet in their right hand with a continental hammer grip behind the baseline on the tennis court.,
Next, the player should position their self so that their left shoulder is facing toward the court in front, their left foot is facing the pole on the right side of the net and their right foot is parallel with the baseline.

,
The serve will be illegal if any part of the foot touches the baseline so the player must not stand on the line but as close as he or she can without touching it.

,
The player must then toss the ball high enough in the air above their head while keeping their eye on the ball.

,
While tossing the ball, their knees must be bent in order to develop power.

,
To maximize power, the player can’t just use his or her arm but must then slightly jump off the ground with their right foot leaning into the ball using their body weight.

,
When the ball reaches its highest peak the player then has to pronate their arm and hit the ball downwards towards the service box on the other side of the court with a large amount of force for it to be fast.

,
When the player swings and pronates their arm, they must engage in full motion meaning they cannot stop in the middle of the swing and they must follow through the entire swing when they serve the tennis ball.

,
After the player follows through the entire swing the racket should finally be behind them on their left side and the ball should clear the net and land in the service box.

Show confidence to your opponent.,
Be consistent.,
If you're down in the score, try some new things.",How to Win a Tennis Tournament," This is extremely important to know because it will allow you to take a clear approach to matches. Are you in the category of a retriever (you don't have tons of power to hit winners but your foot speed and defense let you get many balls back)? Or are you an aggressive player (you're not the most consistent but you can dictate points with your power)?;
, This is not necessary but it can be a very helpful step. Look at where the pros hit and the tactics they use. Obviously you won't be able to use the same plays to perfection but it can put some ideas in your head.

, Be sure to practice every day leading up to it, possibly at the same courts that the tournament will be played on.

, You might have an early morning match or an afternoon match so set your alarm clock to the appropriate time.

, This will give you energy for a good part of the day.

, Dress in your most comfortable tennis outfit, and tennis shoes. Apply a lot of sunscreen if it is sunny out and you are playing outside.

,, At the match, sign in, get the balls, and head to the court you were assigned for the warm-up.

, Try to see what shots he or she is good and bad at, which shot he or she favors the most, etc. Most players tend to go for the forehand and don't have as good a backhand, so try to hit to the backhand as much as possible.


Test all of the opponent's strokes (forehand, backhand, volleys). Hit some balls up the middle and see which stroke they choose to hit. This can tell you what their favorite shot is, so keep in mind that it is probably their strength.

, Unless you believe theirs is very bad, you can let them serve to gain confidence and get the early lead. On the other hand, if you choose to receive first, this will give you a chance to play some points without the added pressure of trying to hold serve.

, Never show worried facial expressions or noises when things don't go your way or else this will make the other player's confidence go up making him play very well. When you are confident, no matter what type of player, you will play very well. So this will make you lose the match. Keep your racket up, and be aggressive toward your opponent.

, Even if your style is an aggressor, don't go for a knockout winner on every shot. You can easily donate the match to your opponent before you know it. Use topspin to hit deep and set up points, always directing balls to your opponent's weakness if possible. Chances are they will miss if you get enough balls back so don't always try to be like Andy Roddick.

, Use your head at all times!!! Start using some low slices, try to approach the net, hit serves wider, etc. Add variety and never stick with a strategy that has you losing.

Restring your racquet as many times a year as you play in a week.",How to String a Tennis Racquet," Many health clubs, sports stores, and gyms with tennis courts have string mounts they use to restring racquets at a cost, usually somewhere between $25-$50 a job. The machines themselves cost anywhere from $200 to several thousand dollars, depending on the quality.



If you play tennis several times a week paying to have $6 worth of string put on your racquet can start to add up, and you'll be able to recoup the savings of buying your own stringing machine relatively quickly. The Gamma X-2 is a common tabletop model, with a 2-point mounting system and drop-weight tension. It's the cheapest and highest-quality string mount for the DIY stringer.If you play a few times a year, or only on weekends, it probably doesn't make sense to invest in your own string mounting system. Pay to have your racquet restrung when the strings wear out, or find one you can use yourself for free.;
, Start by cutting 35 to 40 feet (10.7 to 12.2 m) (10 to 12 m) of new string off a spool. For a basic 95 square-inch racquet with a basic crossing pattern, you'll probably need about 38 feet (11.6 m) of string to finish the job. In general, it's better to have cut off too much and waste some than start with too short a piece and have to start over.


After you string up your racquet the first time, account for the extra you've used to tie the knots and cut a piece of the appropriate size for your racquet. Start with too much and home in on your ideal string length.

, Use a sharp knife, cut the old and broken strings out of the racquet as soon as possible after you decide they're worn out, or one breaks. Start with the strings in the middle of the racquet and cut towards the outside strings.


Inspect the rubber grommets on the rim of the racquet for signs of wear and have new grommets installed if necessary.

, Depending on the specific restringing machine you're using, the mounting process will be slightly different. Secure the head and the neck of the racquet in the designated mounting brackets and press down on the clamps to secure it firmly. Adjust the tension as directed.


6-point mounting systems distribute the tension on the racquet more evenly, but whatever kind of machine you're using, you need to make sure the clamps are secured on the racquet. It should be tight enough to stay still when you shake the grip, but not so tight as to warp the frame.

, Any racquet can be strung in one of two ways, by using one piece of string for both the horizontal and vertical stringing, or by using a separate piece for each. Some tennis players think using a single piece of string increases the life of the set and the racquet, while the proper technique on some racquets makes the use of two pieces more desirable.


It's important to string the cross strings from the end of the racquet (called the head) to the bottom of the face of the racquet, close to the handle (called the throat). This is because the tension of the strings can warp the racquet significantly, and since the throat is weaker than the head, it's better to start at the top and work down. This can be difficult with one piece of string, and impossible on some racquets.

, The main strings run parallel to the long axis of the racquet. Insert the string into the holes at the head of the racquet, thread it down through the neck and back up to the head.


Secure the end of the string into the grip and move the rod into the horizontal position. This might require you to readjust the length of string you initially threaded through the racquet. Tighten the string by twisting the rod to the proper specifications for your racquet.
Fix the second string using the second clamp and release the first string. Continue threading and clamping until all holes have been strung, tightening one, securing the next, and then releasing the previous string.

, After you've secured all the main strings, release the tension rod and tie the end of the string securely, using needle-nose pliers and a small awl, if necessary. Tie a firm knot from the short end onto one of the taught vertical strings. Cut off excess string., When you get to the last main row of the vertically-oriented main strings, you'll tie the string off and start on the crossing pattern. Cross strings run perpendicular to the long axis of the racquet. Insert string into one hole, usually designated by a slightly-larger grommet, and weave the string over and under the main string to the other side. Apply the same amount of tension you applied to the main strings and clamp the first string. Continue weaving until all crosses are strung.


If you're going to use two pieces of string, tie the crossing string to a main string at the head, then thread it back through the big grommet on the nearest edge of the rim, proceeding as normal.
Try to rub the crossing strings on the main strings as little as possible. Wearing the main strings before you even use them will decrease the life of the strings and the racquet.

, Thread the last crossing string back through one of the main grommets and tie it securely to a main string, knotting it with needle-nose pliers. Release the tension and cut off excess string, then remove the racquet from the mount.

, Most racquets have recommended tension measurements printed on the racquet, somewhere in the range of 50 to 70 lbs. (23 to 32 kg). Within that range, players will sometimes customize the amount of tension on the strings to create sweet spots particular to their individual style of play.


For more control over the ball, keep strings tighter. Tight strings allow for more touch and accuracy. For more power, looser strings are recommended. Set the tension measurement on the stringer accordingly and play with different tensions to learn what works best for your style and racquet.

, Experiment with different strings and brands until you find a durable string with a good resiliency. Most tennis strings are made of Kevlar, a strong synthetic fiber. Zyex is also being used for tennis racquet strings for its extra rebound ability, though other varieties are also available:



Nylon strings are the cheapest and most popular strings for their versatility and crisp touch.

Polyester and Kevlar strings are best for heavy-hitters and habitual string-wreckers. These durable strings work best in tandem for optimum strength and control.

Natural gut strings are the most expensive, sensitive, and fragile of the varieties, but also extremely popular among professional players for the liveliness, touch, and elasticity., Small plastic platelets can be inserted into the crossing points of the strings to act as a barrier, protecting them from wear, and increasing the life of the racquet. Players who put a lot of topspin on the ball will likewise find an advantage in the use of string dampeners, which increase spin and dampen the strings. Try them out on the court and see what you think.

, If any of your strings break, it's obviously time for a restring, but what about a regular routine? A good rule of thumb is to restring your racquet as many times annually as you play weekly. So, if you play twice a week, restring your racquet every six months or so. Heavier players and big hitters will likely need to restring their racquets more regularly than occasional players.

Know when to use a forehand.,
Get in proper body position.,
Prepare to swing your racket.,
Get a good grip.,
Hit the ball.,
Complete your follow-through.",How to Hit a Tennis Ball1," Each tennis stroke has a specific application and a best time for it be used.









The forehand, considered to be the most basic of the strokes, is executed on the same side of your body that you hold your racket.
Forehand shots can be used to generate the most power as well as put a topspin on the ball which helps to keep the ball inside the court.;
, In order to hit a forehand, you first need to get into the proper positioning.









As your opponent takes their shot, perform a split step.
A split step is performed by jumping about an inch off the ground and landing on your toes while your opponent prepares to hit the ball.

, Keep your head straight and your shoulders parallel to the net.









As the ball approaches, reposition your shoulders into a 90-degree angle to the net and extending your opposite arm across your body.
Extend your racket arm backward as the ball comes toward you.
Shift your weight to your back leg, and point that foot toward the sideline.

, There are at least three different ways to grip your racket when performing a forehand hit. The most universal, and easiest to start with, is the Eastern Forehand Grip.








For this grip, place your index knuckle and heel of your hand at the third bevel (the indent on the racket’s handle at the 3 o’clock position) and with the heel of your hand at the bottom lug.
An easy way to set up this grip is to imagine you’re shaking hands with the racket.

, Keep the racket straight and the face open towards the net as you make contact.









Swing straight through as you make contact with the ball.
Add a slight downward action as you hit the ball to produce a powerful flat shot.
Use your entire body to generate the power behind your shot. Just before you strike the ball, push your foot off the ground. This starts the chain of kinetic energy that you're putting into your shot. Increase the force of your shot by rotating your upper body into the ball as you strike it.

, The follow through is a vital component in the forehand stroke because it affects the pace and spin of the ball.There are several types of follow-through that produce different effects, as detailed below.









The out-front finish is the easiest to learn and helps you control the direction of your shots. The racket head goes straight out and doesn't twist.
The downward finish is a powerful follow-through that is produced when you hit the ball hard, about waist high, and follow through across your body in a downward motion toward your opposite hip.

"
"
Know when to use the backhand.,
Get into the ready position.,
Find your grip.,
Swing the racket and hit the ball.,
Follow through.",How to Hit a Tennis Ball2," Backhand shots are when one swings the racket around their body with the back of the hand leading out in front. Your shot will have less power than a forehand shot, but backhands are still useful strokes.








Backhands are particularly useful when the ball is on the opposite side of your and your swinging hand.
Backhands are more difficult to master, especially for beginners and younger players with less hand and arm strength. Try practicing first with a two-handed backhand, detailed below, before attempting one-handed backhands.

, As you get read for your opponent to hit the ball to you, point your feet towards the net and keep you knees bent; hold the racket with both hands while facing the net.









Make a split step right before your opponent hits the ball by hopping about an inch off the court. Evenly divide your weight between both your legs.
After making the split step, pivot you left foot, take one step forward with your right foot, and turn your shoulders. All your weight should now be on your back foot, which will help generate power and speed when you make your shot.

, You can either use a one-handed or two-handed grip. The two-handed backhand uses a combination of two grips. 








For your dominant hand (right for right-handers) use a Continental grip. Point the grip to the right and hold your right hand out as if you are shaking hands with the racket.
For your non-dominant hand use a Semi-Western grip. To achieve the Semi-Western grip, place the bottom knuckle of your non-dominant hand on the 8th bevel, pointing diagonally across your palm toward the heel of your hand and beneath your pinkie.

, Swing your arm and the racket to make contact with the tennis ball in front of your body.








, Extend the racket through the shot in the direction you are hitting the ball in one smooth motion, and then rotate your upper body through the shot and towards the net. When you finish, your racket should end up over your right shoulder.








"
"
Know when to use an overhead shot.,
Get ready.,
Swing from overhead and down towards the ground.",How to Hit a Tennis Ball3," The overhead is an important shot, though it’s used less often than the forehand and backhand strokes. If a ball is hit or bounces over your head, it’s the right time to use this stroke.








, As soon as you see the shot headed over your head, use your non-racket hand to point at the ball. This might sound funny or unnecessary, but doing this will help you keep track of the ball, especially while you're a beginner.









Move with the ball and position yourself under it.
Bring your racquet back early so you have more time to hit the ball.

, Try to hit the ball a foot or so out in front of your body, just like the serve. You don’t have to swing super hard; in fact, a slow swing will help you place the ball better.








"
"
Know when to use it.,
Set up the hit.,
Hold your racket in a semi-western grip.,
When you near the ball, begin to measure out your strides.,
Step with your left leg.,
Hit!,
After contact, continue your step and turn around as fast as possible.,
Don't expect to get it right on your first, second, or tenth try.,
Don't get discouraged.,
Don't try to swing too early.,
Never forget to stay just a foot or two to the right or left of the ball.,
Correct any direction mistakes.,
Get low!,
Keep your eye on the ball.",How to Hit a Tweener in Tennis," Hitting a tweener should only be used in certain circumstances. The only time you should consider using the shot is when you have come to the net, but your opponent hits a lob over your head. When running back, you may realize you have no chance of running past the ball, turning around, and hitting it normally, in which case you plan the tweener.


If you do have a chance to run past the ball and hit it as a groundstroke, you certainly should do so. Taking the time to look at the court before hitting it is much better than gambling to hit the ball with your back to the court.;
, If you are devoted to hitting a tweener, run as fast as you can over to the ball. If you are a rightie, run slightly to the right of the ball. If you are a leftie, run slightly to the left.

, If you are not familiar with this grip, hold the racket with a Continental grip (serves, volleys), and then move your hand less than 90 degrees counter-clockwise for righties, clockwise for lefties, looking from the top of the racket. It may feel strange, but other grips will induce too much spin or not provide enough lift to clear the net. It should look as if you are going to shovel up the ball.

, By the time you reach the ball, (for righties), you should still be to the right of the ball with your right leg on the ground while your left leg is rising. (Opposite for lefties). Begin to lift your racket. You should reach the ball when it is about knee level.

, This should push you to the left (right for lefties) enough to be once again centered with the ball, and forward enough so that the ball is almost behind you. The ball should also be dropping past your knees. Begin to swing.

, Getting your swing right will be the most difficult part of the tweener. When you are still striding with your left (right for lefties) leg, your legs should be far enough apart to swing your racket down and flick your wrist at a neutral forehand speed and catch the ball almost below shin level and just slightly behind you. Thanks to your grip, you should have an open face when hitting the ball, lobbing it up above the net.

, If your shot makes it over, you may still have to fight, so put your racket up and assess the situation as fast as you can

, It's all about adjustments and seeing what works best for you. Try tossing the ball in the air lightly a few feet in front of you and trying to get just the motion right. Then try tossing the ball higher and farther away. When you feel more or less comfortable with that, try hitting the ball high with your racket and hitting a tweener with it.

, If nothing seems to work, pick out any way you could possible fix your execution or setup.

, If you hit the ball with the lower part of your racket (higher part when it is behind you), the ball will not travel far enough and you may tend to hit the ball with your frame.

, It may seem unimportant, but the direction of your body is critical to the direction of your shot.

, If you are hitting it well, but the ball goes in the wrong direction, try adjusting your grip or ever changing your entire body direction when you are running into the ball.

, You may have to bend over a bit and/or extend your arm all the way to really get under the ball. The most common mistake aside from completely missing the ball is hitting the ball flat, which just sends it straight into the net or the ground.

, If you are consistently missing the ball completely (you may think that it isn't possible, but it happens a lot), adjust where you swing or the way you step through the ball.

Forehand Side – Use an Eastern or Western Grip (grip like you're using a fry pan)
Two-Handed Backhand Side – Use a combo of Continental and Western Grips
Volleys and Serving – Use Eastern or Continental (handshake grip)

, Choose a light racket and then add lead tape for more control. A good racket for most people is 100-105 square inches and about 10-12 oz. String your racket with the most comfort tension and material. If you notice your racket is slowly losing control, it's time to restring your racket. Ask the tennis stringer for help choosing the right combo of strings and tension.

, See if they have any tips on playing tennis or would like to join your group.


You can also practice on a tennis wall. Start from one side then move to the other side while hitting. Next, try moving back and forth.

, Play with different people and try doubles tennis.

,, This may seem easy and you may think you already do this, but lots of people don't. Many people watch the ball all the time but look away right before the ball hits the racket. Make sure you watch the ball actually hitting your racket strings for every shot: serves, ground strokes, volleys.

, There are two types of stretching: Static and Dynamic. For tennis, do a dynamic warmup. This means you move and stretch at the same time. Static stretching is good for after you hit or play a match.

, For forehands, you can use an open stance, facing your opponent and hitting the ball just in front and to the side of you, at the highest point of its bounce. There is also a semi-open stance and a closed stance that you may try, however it is best to seek advice from a professional coach when first learning technique. Concentrate on the movement and arc of the ball and watch it hit your strings, this will help you hit the sweet spot on your racquet more often. Then, to finish off the shot, follow through with the racquet in the direction that you want the ball to go, after the ball has left the strings. For both ground strokes your racquet head should start off low (i.e below the knees) behind your body and then finish up high above your shoulders slightly behind the neck. Try to follow this procedure for each shot.;
, Many people don't realise that, technically speaking, tennis is about balance and stable postures. If your feet aren't planted and firm, you do not then have a strong base for your torso to swing on, meaning little power is generated. When you are waiting for the ball, be on the balls/toes of your feet, ready to move quickly. Once you have locked on to an approaching ball, set yourself up as discussed above and plant your feet on the ground, moving off only when you have finished your follow-through.

, There are only two areas where you may return a ball and then not keep moving. These are: at the net or at the baseline. Of course you will have to move where your opponent plays the ball but anywhere in between these two areas you should play the ball and then move, either up to the net or backwards to the baseline. Do not stop! This middle area is known as 'no man's land' and if you get caught there, returning the ball will be very difficult.

, Only you can decide what this is because it is based on what kind of person you are in terms of personality and (more specifically) temperament. Many people generally don't have a clear plan in their minds about what shots they are good at or how they want to move their opponent around on the court. Playing styles are unique to each person and you may well have a very flexible one or a rigid one. In either case you will have to alter your serving style, length and movement as well as your rallying style to suit. Aggressive players like to force their opponent into errors by hitting hard, deep shots, thereby controlling the rally and putting pressure on the opponent. These players may also try to move up to the net as often as they can. Once there, they will try to finish the point off. More conservative playing styles will involve less hard hits of the ball, seeking rather to wear out the opponent's stamina and focus.

, Do they try to attempt a particular move often? This may be, for example, a serve out wide, prompting a weak return from you which they then put away to gain the point. Whatever your playing style, you will lose very quickly if you don't take your game plan to your opponent and challenge them. Passive playing will get you nowhere, especially against aggressive players. If you show your opponent that you are aware of his tactics and maybe that you can predict what he's going to do, that will be a psychological advantage to you, they will then be under pressure to try to adapt their style to beat you.

, When returning the ball, as was explained above, you should not feel cramped or restricted, the stroke should be very bold and swift, with plenty of racquet-head movement. This means your feet will have to dance around your body to get your shoulders in position to swing. Furthermore, your shots should be varied in both length and direction. An unexpected short ball near the net can catch your opponent off-guard. Also, don't be afraid to go for the lines and the corners of the court, the more effort you make to do this, the more you force them to get into position quicker, and the more awkward it will be for them.

, It is a common misconception that a low, bullet-like shot that looks flashy and fast is the best to hit in rallies. Not so, a fast, high, looping ball with plenty of topspin can be equally if not more effective. It will bounce up high near the waist or chest of your opponent, making their stroke technique (discussed earlier) harder to implement.

, When playing against a good baseline player, varying your spin from topspin to backspin keeps them guessing, as they will have to slightly adapt their stroke and their racquet head orientation to control these different spins. However, this can be a double-edged sword. Some players tend to use spin on every shot (mostly with backhands) because it gives more control. This is true, but there are times when a hard, flat shot is the best way to dispatch a flailing opponent. Spin allows them more time to recover.

, This does not mean run wildly after your returned ball and hope to catch a volley. Net play requires a carefully chosen moment to act. You would first want to hit a deep or heavily spinning shot to either push your opponent back, getting them off balance or out of the court. Then move in, this is done in two stages. First approach the middle of the court and check your run. Pause slightly here, waiting for the moment to pounce; the opponent may have clawed a shot back earlier than you expected, if so, you are now prepared for it. Approach the net and play the volley. Generally speaking, volleys should be deep, fast and flat. In terms of technique, it's more of a punch or stab than a swing. Footwork is paramount with volleys as you have less time than with ground strokes. Step forward to meet the ball with the opposite foot to the hand you are hitting with, this will ensure you are slightly side on to the shot, allowing you to aim for the corners and get a good angle on your shot.

, This can be ok for amateur games but it is worth being aware of the serve as an important tool to give you the edge in points. If you are serving in a game then you are expected to win it as you have the advantage of playing the first ball for every point in that game. This can mean you can virtually win the point before your opponent even hits the ball. Bearing in mind what was discussed above about using the whole of the court, vary your serves' spin, speed and length. try to aim for the body to mix things up. Tennis becomes a ridiculously easy game if your serve is dependable and accurate.

Place your hand on the racquet so that this V is at 11 o’clock, or one o’clock for left-handed players.To simplify it, think about holding your racquet as you would a hammer. This is called the continental grip , which is the grip you want to utilize for a flat serve. Practice maintaining this grip while keeping your hand loose and relaxed.


In the continental grip, the racquet is at a neutral angle to the ground. In other words, it is perpendicular to the ground when you hold your arm in front of you.The continental grip is valuable for its versatility. You can use it for other types of serves and volleys as well.;
, In a match, you will be standing at the baseline, the line farthest from the net.Right handed players should keep their right foot back, parallel to the baseline. The left foot should be forward, near the baseline and pointing to the right net post. Left handers will be standing in this stance, simply reversed. Once you have your feet in the correct stance, bounce a few times. Get loose and comfortable in this position.


The stance for the flat serve is just like the stance for all other serves— you can’t make it obvious what serve you are preparing for, or your opponent would know exactly what was coming their way!

, By picturing a strong, successful serve, you can help to decrease anxiety. By decreasing your anxiety, you also decrease the likelihood of making little, nervous mistakes. Take deep, calming breaths. Don’t just visualize the image of the serve— imagine the force of the serve and the sound of the ball hitting the racquet. Walk yourself through your serve in your head multiple times. This visualization is a helpful tool in building your confidence and preparing yourself for a great serve."

Hold the ball in your fingertips.,
Toss the ball into the air.,
Keep your eyes on the ball.",How to Hit a Flat Serve in Tennis2," By holding it like this, you are able to more accurately control the toss. When you are setting up for a flat serve, you want to toss the ball in a simple, straight trajectory without any spin. This is most easily achieved when the ball is released from the finger tips, rather than the palm., This should be done by raising the arm straight, and releasing the ball from your fingertips when you are about head height. Because the ball will drop as you raise your racquet to hit it, you want to toss the ball a couple of feet higher than the place you intend to make contact with it. It should be tossed slightly in front of your body., An easy way to do this is by keeping your tossing arm raised during the serve. If you allow your arm to drop, it is easy to drop your head as well.Stay relaxed and focus on the serve, rather than glancing at your opponent or the net. It’s imperative to track the ball with your eyes the whole time!


This is a mistake that is most often made when a player is tense and nervous. As you practice your flat serve and gain confidence, you will more easily keep your eye on the ball the whole time.

As your shift your weight to your back foot, lift the ball of your front foot. In this stance, your body is ready to launch off the ground and into the ball. This helps give the serve its power., Your racquet arm should begin in a bent position behind you as you prepare to serve. Your racquet should be straight up, a little higher than your head. As the tossed ball starts to drop, swing your racquet in a whipping motion. Your arm should be completely extended when it comes into contact with the ball.Focus on hitting the ball squarely from behind. You aren't aiming to create any sort of spin— simply try to hit the back of the ball dead on, making only brief contact with the ball., The follow-through of a flat serve is extremely important. Make sure that, after hitting the ball, you continue to swing through until the racquet is at your opposite hip. If you pump the brakes too early, the serve will not have its full force.

, Transfer your weight so that it is distributed evenly over both feet. Keep your knees bent and shoulder width apart so that you are ready to move. Bring your racquet to the center of your body and hold it with both hands, allowing for quick grip changes and rotations.

If you’re right-handed, you will have your right foot forward and vice versa for left-handed players.;
, A two-handed grip is essentially a continental grip with your dominant hand combined with a semi-Western forehand grip with your non-dominant hand.For players unfamiliar with the various grips, hold your racket looking at the bottom of the pommel with the racket face vertical. Each flat surface on the octagonal grip is a numbered bevel. Start with one on top and and number each bevel clockwise until you get to eight (which is closer to what would be 11 o’clock on a clock face).For this grip place the base knuckle of your index finger on bevel two with the center palm of the hand on bevel one. With your left hand above your right, place both the base index knuckle a palm over bevel seven.Mirror this grip for left-handed players.

, Keep enough bend in your elbows so that the racket face is higher in position than your hands. If you have it racket outstretched too far, then you’re going to steal power away from the swing., You’ll transfer power from your back leg to your front leg as you move through your swing, so ensure that you have planted your leg to start.


This will be reversed for left-handed players.

, Many players tend to twist back at their hips, but you have to remember to pull back from the shoulders. To get the most powerful two-handed backhand, you should pull your arms back until you can practically rest your chin on your forward shoulder., As you wind back, you’ll feel your weight transfer to your back leg. Make sure that you don’t plant your back leg because as you follow through with the swing, your weight will transfer forward again.

, The slot is the space about one foot below the height where you will connect with the ball.Don’t swing forward yet. Simply lower the racket into the slot while maintaining the correct grip.


Once in the slot, the racket will be pointed very slightly closed face, meaning tilted just barely toward the ground rather than the sky. This is where you want it because as you follow through, your wrist will twist slightly upward to even out the racket., Since the slot is about one foot lower than the contact point of the ball, you’ll lift as you swing.This allows you to uncoil the power in your shoulders and put enough lift on the ball to clear the net.

, As you bring the racket around, your weight will transition forward again. As you uncoil, you may even come slightly off your back foot., The ideal spot to make contact with the tennis ball is just after your swing passes your forward hip and as you’ve lifted the racket right around waist height.This is the spot in your two-handed grip where the racket will be perfectly vertical., Keep your eyes on the point where the ball makes contact with the racket as you swing through.Many players can prematurely turn their gaze away from the point of contact. By trying to keep your eyes on that point as you swing through, you’re less likely to err on the point go contact.

, The swing should be powerful yet relaxed so that you don’t throw your entire weight into the swing and lunge forward as you contact the ball.This movement should keep your back relatively straight to stop you from throwing yourself forward.By not throwing yourself forward as you swing through, you also keep yourself in a better ready position to attack the next shot.

In a tennis match, there are normally 6 ball boys; 2 at the net and 1 in each corner. The ball boys at the net are positioned so that they each have a side. One at the left of the net, and one at the right. The ball boys have shifts, however, normally lasting 30-60 minutes.;
, The ball boys at the net are responsible for rolling down the ball to the serving end. The ball boys in the back corners are responsible for either retrieving the ball and rolling it down to the serving end, or retrieving the ball and handing it to the server.


Since there are 6 ball boys in a tennis match, how is it decided who gets which ball? Normally, the person closest to the ball retrieves. At the net, there are several variations to who gets which ball. When there are 2 ball boys at the net, each ball boy is designated a side, but when a ball lands close to a ball boy at the net, even if that ball boy is not on that side, he may get it. Note that no ball boys should ever attempt to roll down the ball during a second serve or a let.

, Which choice will take the least time? Is this going to be of annoyance to the players? Is it going to annoy the audience? If your choice follows all of those guidelines, it is most definitely permitted.

, If you find yourself in a situation where you only have five ball boys in your group, and you’re making your way onto the court, what should you do? Obviously, if you are a ball boy for a major tournament, this would never happen, but you probably going to be reading this if you are or were in a major tournament like Wimbledon or even the Rogers Cup. So, if you do actually face this problem, the most logical thing to do would be to designate a person to be a “runner”. There always has to be two ball boys at the net, but the ball boys in the back, or corners, are not always needed. The most important thing to remember is that you need two people at the back on the server’s end, and one on the receiver’s end. When the players change serving roles, your “runner” will have to run to the other side so that there are two people on the serving end now, and one on the receiving end. Make note of when you don’t have to run to the other side. This is when the score in the total amount of games in that set is odd. However, in the tiebreak, the players don’t change every even.


Let’s say that you are a ball boy at the net, and you are chasing down a ball. The ball that you are chasing, however, didn’t stop where you thought it would, but rather kept on rolling and now find yourself not near the net, but near a ball boy in the corner. What do you think is the most sensible solution? If you had thought it through, it would be staying with the ball boy in the corner for one point, and then go back to your original position.

, Normally, this isn’t a hard task, however, if that player is the server, keep two things in mind. The first one is to remember to give him the towel and drop that ball onto his racket. The second is to keep in mind that he/she doesn’t want to be waiting for you, so give him/her the towel, pick up any balls that you have to retrieve (quickly!) and take back the towel and put it back in the designated area. When players are switching sides, make sure that you give the towel back to the player, they don’t want to use someone else's!

, When the server has just finished a point with a ball, he/she normally won’t want to play with that same ball again. If you have no other balls but that one, give it to him/her, but normally they will turn around to another ball boy. If it just so happens that you have no balls whatsoever, show your two hands showing the player that they are empty. Do this also to show how many balls you have, even when you have three, four or even five. When you are feeding a tennis ball to the player, make sure it bounces once on the ground and “floats” about at the player’s waist level.

, Sometimes tournaments supply water or refreshments for the players. If the player asks for some type of beverage, run to the bin and get it.


Same as for the towels, if a ball is rolling down, and the player needs a tennis ball, give it to the player, and then retrieve the ball.

, If you are at the net, you will most likely be asked to hold an umbrella for the tennis player. Sometimes the ball boys at the back will be asked to stand in front of the players.

Join the United States Tennis Association (USTA).",How to Become a Professional Tennis Player," Whether you’re a teenage player or someone in his or her twenties, you’ve got to make sure you are fit enough to compete on the court. This is because playing professional is extremely demanding physically and will push you to your limits and possibly beyond. There are a number of things you can do to make sure you’re in shape to compete on the court:


Do some cardio training. Try to run at least 3 times a week.
Do some light weight training. The goal here is to not bulk up and become muscular, but to make sure you are fit and your body is prepared for the grueling time you’ll experience on the court.
Consider hiring or consulting with a personal trainer who will help you put together an exercise routine that fits your schedule and goals.;
, Practice is the only way to get better at tennis. In order to go pro, you’ll have to put in countless hours of playing tennis so that you can get an edge on future opponents. Make sure to use your available hobby or leisure time to supplement your scheduled practice time. Remember, as a professional player, tennis will dominate your life. Tennis, then, will dominate your life when you’re on the path to becoming a pro.


Establish a schedule for yourself that engages you as many times a week as you need to improve.
Many pre-professional players train six days a week for several hours a day.
Psychologists say that it takes about 5 years, or 1,000 hours to become an expert at something mainly involving sports., There are a wide array of summer tennis programs available to those in secondary school or college. Summer tennis programs will be immersive and will introduce those enrolled into the world of competitive tennis. Summer programs are an excellent way to gain experience, practice, and to get a foot in the door of the competitive tennis world., If you’re in middle or high school and your school has a tennis team or program, make sure to sign up as soon as you can. Playing in school will give you the ability to devote extra time to practicing your future profession. Try to view school tennis competitions as a pathway to success and as a path to going pro., While you’ll be playing tennis competitively in secondary school, many of the best players also play competitive in non-school related competitions. This way, you’ll have two tracks to success and even more time to practice and gain experience.


Start playing in junior Zone Advancement Tournaments (ZATs). When playing ZATs, you’ll have the opportunity to accumulate points. Points will enable you to progress towards higher tournaments and competitions.
Champ up. After ZATs, you do a thing called ""champing up"" which happens after you accumulate a certain amount of points from winning matches. This means that the more tournaments you play, more chances you have to advance to higher level tournaments.
Once you get to a thing called “super champ,” you can now participate in national tournaments. At this point, you will have gained a reputation in the tennis world as one of the best junior players in the nation.
After you gain really good rankings in the United States, you will be invited to play in worldwide tournaments for juniors such as the junior U.S. Open, or even junior Wimbledon., While you’re competing in secondary school and in non-school related tennis competitions, you should also consider trying to win tennis scholarships to universities with good tennis programs. These scholarships will fund your education but also allow you to devote a lot of your time as an undergraduate to the tennis world.


To win scholarships, you’ll not only need to have a winning record as a player on the court but also have good academic records.
If you’ve won tournaments or attended the junior Wimbledon or something comparative, your chances of winning a scholarship will increase.
Top programs for men include: University of Southern California at Los Angeles, the University of Virginia, and Baylor University.
Top programs for women include: Duke University; Vanderbilt University; and the University of California at Los Angeles. , Top players do things a bit different than those they play against. Top players have approaches to the game and habits that set them apart from everyone else and help propel them to the top of the sport. Consider:


Focusing on improving parts of your game instead of focusing on simply hitting the ball. Top players use every practice session as a way to improve different elements of their game. As a result, over a long period, their whole game improves.
Set yourself a routine. Most pro players have a specific routine before every match. Whatever your routine is, make sure you master it and you're comfortable with it.Embrace your own approach. One thing many tennis pros agree upon is that there is no one correct tennis technique. Ultimately, a swing or technique that works for one person might not work for another. Just make sure to practice as much as you can and get feedback so you can identify the best technique for you., Even before you take formal steps to become a professional player, you need to play against people who challenge you. Playing challenging opponents will be the best way to improve your skill level and prepare yourself for the many high-level opponents you will surely face as a professional player.


Join a league or a club with players who are better than you. If you’re a high school player, you might want to see if you can practice against some college players in your area. They’ll surely have more skill and experience, and you’ll learn from your matches with them.
Avoid playing against people you always beat. While it might be fun to win, you won’t learn much from playing against the same people and beating them all the time.
Play against people who are older than you, even if they are significantly older. People who have been playing for decades might enjoy playing against younger players. The benefit is for both players: they’ll enjoy having an energetic and enthusiastic youth to play against, and you’ll learn from their many years of experience on the court. , Even if you practice rigorously, there's only so much you can learn on your own. Find someone who can help guide your training, whether it's a paid coach or a casual mentor (though you will eventually need to move to a paid coach if you really want to go pro).


Expect to be challenged. Having someone else guide your training means that you'll be pushed harder to improve. It won't be any easy process, but your payoff will be greater in the end.
Make your coaching time count. Pay close attention to the advice you receive while you're training. If you really want something to become a part of your technique, make it into a mantra that you repeat (aloud or in your head) as you play.
Spend the time to find good coaches. Bad coaches are out there, believe it or not (from personal experience). Your time will be paid back when you get superb coaching. , In addition to your coach, you’ll want to find a mentor or mentors who are or were professional players and will be able to give you tips and offer guidance on your career path. Your mentors don’t need to be in your local community. They can be people you visit or encounter every so often. The important thing is that they are willing to give you advice and maybe play against you every so often so they can evaluate you and critique your game. To find a mentor, consider:


Asking your coach or someone in your practice cohort/circle to introduce you to someone who is exceptionally skilled.
Cultivate relationships with skilled or professional athletes you meet at tournaments and at other tennis-related events. It is best to slowly engage and communicate with people you want to mentor you, rather than to just ask them outright.
Look for mentor programs through local and national tennis organizations.

, Since experience is so important in turning pro, the best players started extremely young. Playing tennis dominates their life from childhood onward. You’ll likely lose out on many experiences that your peers have.


The average age that top players started tennis was 6 or 7 years old.
The later you start in life, the lower your chances of becoming a top competitor are.
Starting in your late-teens drastically decreases chances of becoming a professional., The top professional tennis players in the world often share a number of similar attributes. These attributes are both natural and acquired. Ultimately, these important attributes and practices helped set them apart from their competition.


Top players are often faster and more agile than their competitors.
Top players practice less on average.
Top players do more fitness training than other players.
Top players are often slimmer than their competitors., Being a professional tennis player involves many sacrifices. You’ll have to give up a lot of time to get the practice you need to succeed. You’ll miss out on a lot when you’re on the road competing in tournaments. As a result, you should greatly consider all of the sacrifices you’ll make if you choose to go professional.


Your academic career in secondary school and college will probably suffer.
Many professional tennis players are tracked as pro in middle school or early high school and are unable to attend college until later in life.
Your family, social and love life will be impacted as much of your time will be devoted to practice and travel., Becoming a professional tennis player is no cheap endeavor. If you choose to go professional, you’ll be putting yourself on a path that costs a lot of money. This is a cost that most people cannot afford.


You’ll need money to pay coaches early in your career.
You’ll have to pay for travel and other costs associated with competing in tournaments far from home.
Most professional players do not make money playing.
It is estimated that it costs $160,000 to compete professionally on the circuit every year.
Look for financial aid from organizations like the United States Tennis Association. Financial aid, if you qualify, will help pay for travel and other expenses related to competing., To compete in the US, you'll have to join the USTA. Once you’re a member of the USTA, you’ll have the opportunity to join and compete in USTA leagues and tournaments. Participating in tournaments, leagues, team tennis and other activities allows you to accumulate points to attain a ranking. As your ranking grows, you’ll move closer to being the successful professional player you’ve dreamed of being.


The USTA is truly one of the most important gateways to a professional career.
The USTA has a great website where you can search for tournaments in your area. See: http://tennislink.usta.com/Tournaments/Common/Default.aspx

If you don't live in the US, search online for your country's competitive tennis organization.

Learn the four mental states of a successful tennis player.,
Forget about winning.,
Forget about what has happened in the previous point and focus on your next shot.,
Focus on hitting the ball.,
Change your mindset.,
Don't try to always hit the winner.,
Believe in yourself.,
Don't think about hitting the ball.",How to Practice Zen Tennis," Mental fitness is as important as physical fitness in tennis. Focusing on these states and practicing ways to improve your mental focus should form a part of your regular training. The four essential mental states are:Concentration - staying in the present
Commitment - you must maintain both drive and stamina
Control - not only of the ball and racquet, but also over your emotions and behaviour, including your reaction to bad weather, broken racquets, bad line calls, snapped nets, noisy crowds, etc.
Confidence - your certain belief that you can manage anything on the court.;
, Winning will come from better aligned focus, and getting the basics right. How can you get the basics right if you spend your time focusing on winning the point instead of focusing on hitting the ball?


Think of your concentration level as a limited bucket. If use up your concentration on trying to win, hitting a winner or the previous point you lost or won, then you have less concentration to spend on hitting that next ball. This leads to more unforced errors.

, Tennis is a short game when you think about it, and many players dwell on how they should have won that last point, what they did wrong, or how to win the next point. This takes away from your concentration bucket and causes more unforced errors.

, By enjoying each point, and focusing on the enjoyment each strike brings, you will naturally focus on the ball.


Keep your eye on the ball. This is the key to good tennis, and you will naturally hit better shots.

, Instead of trying to win the point, try thinking about how to make the rally longer. After all, you are here to play tennis and the enjoyment it brings should be at the forefront of the game's purpose. By trying to make the point longer, you will distract yourself from focusing on winning the point, and instead point that focus on hitting the ball correctly. After all, to make the point last longer, you need to hit more balls in, which means you need to focus on the ball and hitting it correctly.

, If the opportunity presents itself then take it, but do not force the winner. By looking for winners, you are taking away from your concentration bucket, leaving less for focusing on the ball.

, When you start losing, don't step back and start playing like a weak player. Know that you have done this before and that you can play at this level. Most of the time you will start to focus on how many points you have lost, and how poorly you are playing. This will take away from your concentration bucket, and leave you with nothing to hit the ball with.

, Substitute an enjoyment of guiding the ball to its desired location. When you guide the ball, your concentration becomes focused on the ball, rather than on you. Your strokes will become naturally longer with the correct follow through, and power will come when you learn to co-ordinate the ball directly onto the sweet spot. You'll find your stamina is increased as you get less tired hitting the ball, because you are letting the racquet do the work.

Consider the difference between a game, set, and a match.,
Know how each game is scored.,
Know how to call the score when you are serving.,
Understand how each set is scored.,
Know that you must always win by two if there is a tie.,
Know when the match has been won (or lost).,
Know how to write down the score after the match.,
Understand what ‘all’ means in tennis.,
Know what ‘love’ means.,
Understand the words ‘deuce’ and ‘advantage’.,
Understand ‘ad-in’ and ‘ad-out’.",How to Keep Score for Tennis," The match is the term that refers to the entire playing time of tennis. A match is comprised of either the best of three sets, or the best of five sets (depending on your league). Each set is played best out of six games.;
, One player serves per game. A game is generally won when a player (or team if you are playing doubles) wins four points. A point is started when one player serves, and the opponent hits it back and the point continues in a back and forth manner until one player hits it out or in the net. Keep in mind that a game might take seven points, or more, to end if, for instance, one player wins three points and another wins four. Each point is given its own value for each player:


1st point won is ""15 points""
2nd point won is ""30 points""
3rd point won is ""40 points""
4th point won makes GAME (signifying the end of the game)

, During each game, it is the server’s job to call out the score so that the opponent can hear it (unless you are actually playing in a professional setting in which they have a score keeper). You are always supposed to say your score, followed by your opponent’s score. For example:


If you have won two points and your opponent has won one, you would call out “30-15”.
If your opponent has won three points and you have won one, you would call out “15-40”.

, Each set is played until one player or team (if you are playing doubles) has won six games. At the beginning of your serve, you must always call out the number of games each player or team has won, starting with your score. For example:


If you have won four games, and your opponent has won two, you would call out “4-2” before beginning your “service game” (the game you serve the ball in, rather than receive).

, This refers to both games and sets. Here are some examples:


If you both have a score of 40 to 40, then you have to win two points in a row in order to win the game. (See Step 3 below for more details).
If you both have won 5 games, and the score is 5 to 5, then you will need to win two more games in a row to make it 7-5 in order to win the set.
If it is 5 to 5 and you win the next game, the score becomes 6-5. If you lose the next game and the score is 6-6, you will need to win 8 to 6 in order to win the set. Some sets have had scores of 12 to 10 or even higher.

, Depending on the league you are playing in, you will either need to win three out of five sets, or two out of three sets. However, like with games and sets, you must win by two. That means that matches can sometimes be five out of seven sets, or even seven out of nine sets if you and your opponent keep tying.

, On a scorecard, you should write the score of each set down. You should always write your score first. For example, if you won the match, your scorecard might look like this:


6-3, 4-6, 6-2. That means that you won the first set 6 games to 3; you lost the second set 4 games to 6; and you won the third set 6 games to 2.

, ‘All’ essentially means ‘both’ in tennis lingo. If you and your opponent have both won one point, thus making it 15-15, you would actually call out “15-all”. The same goes for sets. If you both have won three games, you would call out “3-all” before starting your serve., And no, we are not talking about the romantic, or even the platonic, kind of love. In tennis, the word ‘love’ refers to a score of zero. For example:


If you are serving and have not won any points, but your opponent has won two, you would call out “love-30”.
Same goes for games. If you have won three games, but your opponent has won none, you would call out “3-love”.
If you are just beginning a game and neither of you have won any points, you would call out “love-all”. (Which is a pretty nice sentiment to begin a game with).

, In tennis, when two players have a tied score of 40 to 40 during a game, it is called a ‘deuce’. There are two ways to play out a deuce--either the person to get the next point wins, or you play ‘advantage’ (‘ad’ for short). This means that a player must win the deuce point, and the following point., When the player serving wins the deuce point, the score is ‘ad-in’ (advantage-in, meaning the server has the advantage). When the receiver wins the deuce point, the score is ‘ad-out’. If one player wins the deuce point, but doesn’t win the ad, then the score goes back to deuce.


For example, if you were serving and you both won four points (making it 40-40 a.k.a. deuce) then you would serve again. Let’s say you won the deuce point making it ‘ad-in’. If you win the next point, you win the game. If you lose the next point, the score goes back to deuce and your opponent has the chance to beat you and get ‘ad-out’. If your opponent loses the ‘ad-out’, it goes back to deuce...etc.

"
"
Decide who goes first.,
Alternate servers.,
Serve from the advantage (left) side of the hash first.,
Hit your second serve from the deuce side of the court.,
Keep your side at the beginning of the tiebreaker.,
Change sides after every six points.,
Switch sides in the middle of your service set.,
Trade sides after the tiebreaker.,
Be the first to score seven points.,
Win by two.,
Be aggressive.,
Get in shape.",How to Play a Tennis Tiebreaker," The person who was set to serve at the end of the last game will serve first in the tiebreaker. In tennis, the server switches at the end of every game. If you were the receiver in the game before the tiebreaker, then you will serve first. Just like in a normal tennis game, the first service will be from the deuce (right) side of the of the hash.


Unlike a regular tennis game, the first server in a tiebreaker will only serve one point. In normal tennis games, only one person serves throughout the game.;
, After the first player serves one point, the second server will serve two points. For the rest of the tiebreaker, each server will serve two points at a time. Remember that you will change servers after every serve where the total score is odd.If the the score is four to three, then you would change servers because the total number of points is seven, an odd number.
If the score is four to two, then the server would have one more serve because the total number of points is six, an even number.

, After the first serve in the tiebreaker, each player will perform the first of their two serves from the left side of the hash. In normal tennis games, you always serve first from the right side of the hash so it may feel a bit awkward to switch it up in the tiebreaker.


An easy way to remember this is that every even point will be served from the advantage side of the court. For example, if the score is four to three and you are serving the eighth point in the game, then you will serve it from the left side of the court., After you serve from the left side of the hash, you will move to the right side of the hash to perform your second serve. The exception to this rule is of course that the very first point in the tiebreaker is also served from the deuce side of the court.


Every time you serve an odd point, you will serve it from the right side of the court. For example, if the score is three to three and you are serving the seventh point in the game, then you will serve it from the right side of the court.

, In tennis, players only switch sides at the end of odd numbered games in a set. The tiebreaker is technically the thirteenth game in a set so both players will remain on the same side of the court they were on for the twelfth game.


In normal tennis games you would switch sides after the first game, the third game, the fifth game and after any other odd numbered games.

, In normal tennis games, players keep their side for the entirety of the game. In tiebreakers however, players will alternate sides after every point where the total score is a multiple of six. Switching sides during the tiebreaker keeps everything fair. One side of the court may be at a disadvantage, especially if you’re playing outside.If the score is five to one, then the total score of the game is six and the players would have to alternate sides.
Some examples of disadvantage you may have on a particular side of a court include: the glare from the sun, the wind blowing in your face and the blinding lights at the venue.

, Because players change sides of the court at the end of an even number of points (six) and servers alternate after odd numbered points, whoever was serving before the side switch will serve their second serve after the side switch.In normal tennis games, the side switch occurs at the beginning of a new game so there is always a new server.

, If there is another set after the tiebreaker, the players will start the first game of the new set on the opposite ends of the court from where they ended up in the tiebreaker. If the score of the tiebreaker is seven to two, the players will switch sides for the next game even though there has only been three serves since the last side change.


Most professional organizations worldwide don’t allow tiebreakers to be played in the final set of a match so there will always be a new set after a tiebreaker.
The U.S. Tennis Association is one of the only worldwide tennis organizations that does allow tiebreakers to be played in the final set of a match.

, You only have to score four points in order to win a normal tennis game. In a tiebreaker however, you have to score seven points to achieve victory. The way points are counted in a tiebreaker is also different from the way they are counted in a normal tennis game.In a normal tennis game points are counted as: love (zero), 15 (one), 30 (two) and 40 (three).
In a tiebreaker points are simply counted as: one, two, three, four and so on.

, Just like a normal game of tennis, you must attain a two point advantage over your opponent to win the tiebreaker. The game will continue as long as it takes for one player gain a two point lead over the other.If the score is seven to six, the player with six points has one more chance to even the score up.

, Tiebreakers are mental and can be high-stress situations. You may be tempted to play it safe, but you’ll likely be more successful going into attack mode. Keep the intensity of your serves and be unpredictable. Try to get off to an early lead by getting in your opponent's head.


For example: If both you and your opponent are right handed, then it would be safer to serve the ball down the middle of the court so they’d have to return it using their backhand. However, they might be caught off guard if you serve towards their stronger forehand.Tiebreakers are often decided by mental errors. Force your opponent to make mistakes by making it impossible for them to know where you’ll hit the ball next.

, If you and your opponent are evenly matched, then a tiebreaker can last for a long time. The game can go back and forth a number of times before one player finally earns a two point advantage. Make sure to do plenty of cardio to build your endurance. The last thing you want to do is run out of steam in the middle of a close match. Basic cardio exercises like jogging will help you build your general stamina but tennis is a sport that requires quick bursts of energy. Be sure to do drills that help your body build endurance specifically for tennis.Do mirror drills. One partner runs up court, down court and shuffles side to side while calling out where they’re moving. A partner on the other end of the court does their best to mirror the first partners motions. If the first partner says “left” then he’d shuffle to the left of the court and the other partner would shuffle to his right. Switch partners after sixty seconds and do this drill at least five times.
Do side to side drills. A feeder hits one ball to the left side of the court, one to the middle, one to the right and then back again. A runner tries to chase down and return each ball. Each player should be runner for about five minutes. The feeder should have quite a few extra balls so the drill can run smoothly.

As the ball comes over the net and approaches your wing, open your shoulders by turning and taking the racquet back. Keep your legs shoulder width apart and comfortably bent. This is called the ready position. 





;
, Keep your racket head about level to your head as your non-dominant hand leaves the throat of your racquet. Ensure that you fully turn your shoulder and that you don’t bring the racquet back too low or too high. Lock your wrist to ensure smooth, circular, and consistent movement as you take your racquet back.








Your forehand may become erratic if your backswing is inconsistent. Don’t take a longer backswing to produce extra power. Be consistent especially when under pressure., After you have calculated the approach of the ball and adjusted yourself into the correct position, drop the racket below the level of the ball by bending your elbow and pronating your forearm. Build up racquet speed to be unleashed at the point of contact.








Lock your eyes on to the ball. Freeze your head until after you have made contact and ensure that there are no hitches to your swing., Hit the ball when the ball is a comfortable distance from your body and within striking range. Extend your arm out and use your wrist to keep the face of the racquet laid back as it makes contact with the ball at maximum speed.








Do not exaggerate the low-to-high trace of your swing because your shots may unintentionally land short, giving your opponent an opportunity to attack.

, Upon impact, continue your arm’s extension out in front of you by whipping your wrist and pronating your forearm. Bring the head of your racquet to the side of your non-dominant hand to create a windshield wiper like finish.








Stay locked and balanced. Don’t look up too early to watch where your shot will land. These can affect your shot and make it go awry.

, Do not decelerate your racquet head in your follow through or your shots may fly out of bounds. Don’t shorten your follow through or you may hit the net.








Keep your swing path smooth and continuous, starting from your backswing, through your hit, and ending with your follow through. There should be no jerky motions at any point of your forehand., Controlling your head movement produces a consistent swing path. Don’t look up or stand up too soon. Remain focused and keep your eyes on the ball from the second it leaves the racquet of your opponent until after your follow through.








Keep your head down and don’t look up early to see where the ball is going. Keep consistent with your follow through.

, Picture shaking hands with someone and use the same technique to hold your racquet. Allow one edge of your racquet to point to the court as you hold your racquet vertical. Wrap your fingers around your racquet’s grip at the butt end.








, Place your palm barely behind the handle of the racket. If you’re right-handed, place the racquet at the right side of your body and grip it with your wrist at the butt of the handle slightly to the right. The space between your index finger and thumb should be towards and above the rear of the handle.








Keep the racquet out to the left of your body if you’re a left handed player. Grip the racquet with your palm slightly behind the handle. Keep your wrist at the left butt end of the handle. The space between your index finger and thumb should be placed at the rear and above the handle.
This is the most common grip for beginners, known as the Eastern Forehand Grip. It is used to hit solid forehands because it is the most natural and versatile grip; however, there are also the Western and Continental grips used for other tennis shots like the slice.

, When you want to hit with power, close the racquet face on your backswing. Closing the racquet face during your backswing generates more topspin when you hit the ball with power. Aim slightly higher than the top of the net.







, Place the knuckle of your index finger and lower palm on the fourth bevel of your racquet grip. A shortcut is to place the racquet flat on the ground. When you pick it up you create the natural contact points between your shoulders and waist.








Adjust your backswing so that it’s closed by angling the face of your racquet towards the ground. You can hit the ball harder as you close your backswing more. Practice making the ball go airborne as you apply more power and create more spin. If done incorrectly, you will actually reduce the power of your forehand., Place the knuckle of your index finger and the bottom of your palm on the fifth bevel of your racquet grip. You should make contact with the ball around your shoulders.







, You want to easily shift your grip to create the appropriate type of shot. For example, you may change to a Continental Grip from an Eastern Grip to hit a drop shot or short slice.







, A Western Grip can generate the most spin. For the Western Grip, place the knuckle of your index finger and the bottom of the palm of your hand on the fifth bevel of the racquet grip.








, Have a semi-open stance unless your opponent hits the ball short. If the ball is hit short, step forward into a neutral stance. For a semi-open stance, take a slight step to the side and rotate your shoulder until you lock your hips at the pelvic joint.








The lock position maintains balance by lifting your non-hitting hand parallel to the court.

, Bend and relax your hand as you hold the racquet vertically. Keep the butt-cap facing the court and your body straight but bent at your knees. Rotate your body as your bent knees complete your full body rotation.







, Push off your dominant leg and rotate your shoulder and hips. Keep your weight on your dominant leg and bend your knees. Your dominant foot should be pointed outwards as you stand in the lock position. Keep your shoulder perpendicular to the net as you watch the ball over your non-dominant shoulder.








Keep your dominant hand holding the racquet vertical and your non-dominant arm parallel to the court.

, Start to drop your racquet as you create a C shape swing path towards the ball. Uncoil your shoulders and push off on your dominant leg. Open up your shoulder and hip toward the court as you further drop your racquet.








Watch the ball as you drop your racquet.

, Square your body to the net, keeping the racquet below the ball. Rotate your body forward and bring the racquet face through the ball. Cock your dominant wrist completely back as you snap through the ball. Straighten up your dominant leg as you push off through your hit.








Your non-dominant leg will begin to slightly lift off the ground. Keep your head steady and watch the ball upon impact.

, Keep your body straight as your non-dominant foot leaves the ground. Extend your dominant hand through the contact. Finish your swing across your body rather than across your shoulder. Keep your eye on the ball over your dominant shoulder.








Your non-dominant foot will land back on the ground and your non-dominant hand should catch the racquet after your follow through. Your dominant foot will come forward to keep your balance as your body fully rotates to complete the hit.

, Perfect your forehand through repetition. Try to mimic the same motion over and over again. You want to create a habit by using drills so that, when it comes to the pressure of a game, your muscles will be able to execute the same movements.







, Keep things simple and don’t confuse yourself with too much information. Visualize a smooth stroke path. You can only improve your forehand through repetition. Visualization can help your body reproduce the correct movements that maximize the accuracy, topspin, and power of your forehand.







, Don’t try to copy the idiosyncrasies of the top pros. Master the fundamentals first and then an easy and simple swing that feels natural to you. Power and topspin will come on their own without trying to change the basics.







, You must move your feet to ensure perfect timing and movement to keep your ideal balance. Set up correctly to receive the ball. Setting up in time will give you options where to hit the ball.








The correct setup is having your non-dominant leg in front of the other while both knees are bent. Your hips and shoulders should be open as your body readies to explode into your forehand.

, Use the forehand as a weapon and strategically hit your shots at optimum locations. Be patient and vary the location and speed of your shots. Keep your opponent guessing.








For example, if your opponent is directly in front of you, you may want to hit your forehand across the court so that your opponent must run to retrieve it. When someone is forced to run to make a shot, it increases the level of difficulty as she must aim and generate power while off balance. The right shot depends on exploiting your opponent’s weakness. For example, if your opponent has a weak backhand, aim to exploit it.

, Don’t hit the ball when it’s too close or too far from your body. Avoid hitting the ball in a sideways direction or if it’s in front of you. Hit the ball at a comfortable reach when it’s close to your hip.







, Open your racquet face as you make contact. Create a brushing effect between your racquet and the ball to create topspin. Make sure that the angle of your swing moves from low to high.







, For topspin, follow through over your dominant shoulder. Transfer your weight in a forward and upward direction by bending your knees during your preparation and straightening them as you uncoil and rotate your body to hit the ball.







, If your court creates a high bounce to your ball, then a Western or Semi-Western Grip is ideal. This allows you to hit the ball at a higher point of contact. If the court produces a low bounce then a continental grip is ideal. The Eastern Grip is ideal to hit flat and straight shots.

Figure out what kind of tennis player you are.,
Determine your most frequent court surface type.,
Pick the right sole for the surface.,
Determine your foot type.,
Determine cushioning material type.,
Make a list.,
Consider sizing up.,
Do some research.,
Make your purchase.,
Enjoy your shoes.",How to Buy Tennis Shoes," Typically players are either ""serve and volley,"" who charge the net and slide their back foot while serving, or ""baseline,"" who generally play along the back line. Since these two types move differently on the court, they wear shoes out differently.

Choose a shoe with a toecap if you're a ""serve and volley"" player.
Buy shoes with lots of lateral support and a durable sole if you run from side to side a lot.;
, The harder the court surface, the more durable the sole should be. Using the right sole for the right court surface can prolong the life of your shoes, offer the right amount of traction and prevent court surface damage., Hard surfaces wear shoes out faster. Shoes made for concrete are more durable and made with tougher materials, while others are more flexible.

For clay or grass courts, the soles may not be as durable, but they are designed to provide traction without damaging the court.
Multi-court shoes are also available that adapt well for a variety of surfaces.
Shoes with a herringbone style outer sole work especially well for clay. The narrow treading helps grip the floor and prevent loose grains on the surface from entering the sole and smoothing it out., This is arguably the most important step in choosing the right tennis shoe. Your foot type will determine how much lateral support and cushioning you will need for optimal safety and comfort.

Use the ""wet test"" to determine your foot type. Wet the soles of your foot and step onto a flat surface, such as a piece of construction paper or the sidewalk. Look at the area between the ball of the foot and the heel of the foot.

A large gap indicates a high arch, which means your feet are supinated.
No gap at all indicates flat feet, which means your feet are pronated.
If your feet are in between, then they are neutral.For supinated feet: Opt for a more flexible shoe. You will experience most wear and tear around the heel and toes.
For pronated feet: Buy a stabilizing tennis shoe, since you will experience most wear and tear around the front inside area of your foot.
For neutral feet: You can try just about any shoe.

, Tennis shoes are made with 2 types of cushions: EVA and PU. EVA cushions are lighter and more flexible, but offer less stability and durability. PU cushions are more durable and stable, but tend to be heavier., Putting together a list of your play style, court style and foot type will help you figure out what kind of shoes you should be shopping for, so you don't waste your time trying on tennis shoes that won't work for you., Remember that feet tend to swell a bit during exercise and you may be wearing thicker socks than normal., Knowing what kind of sole and how much stability you need, based on court type, playing style and foot type will go a long way. Determine how much the kind of shoes you're looking for tend to cost.

Even if budget is a factor, buying the best shoes you can afford will help protect your feet and ensure your shoes last as long as possible.
Shopping around and visiting different stores and websites can help you find the best deal.
In general, you get what you pay for, and $80 shoes will be higher quality and last longer than $15 shoes—but paying big bucks for celebrity-endorsed shoes may not be worth it.

, After you've figured out what kind of shoes you need, the brand and style you like, and where the best deal can be found, it's time to buy!

Unlike leather shoes, most tennis shoes do not need to be ""broken in"" and should feel ready to play in when you try them on. They should fit snugly but not so tightly they will chafe.Stores specializing in athletic shoes may have employees who can recommend brands and styles that will work well for you.
If you're ordering shoes online, be sure you know the site's return policy and how to return shoes that don't work for you.

A simple soap and water solution rubbed over the dirty parts will probably suffice, or tennis balls can be placed in the washing machine inside a laundry washing bag. If they're split, they may still have some uses, so don't throw them out just yet.;
,
Tennis balls can fix a lot of things around the house if you just know what to do with them! Here are some suggestions:


Put the tennis balls in the bottom of a chair or stool to protect wooden or delicate floors from scraping and to reduce the noise level. You could also give many old tennis balls to a local school or community group if they want to do the same (schools often need them for this purpose). Or, donate them to a senior center or assisted-living facility – tennis balls make great skid stoppers on the legs of walkers. These are great ways to use split tennis balls.
Cut one in half and use it to open jars. Simply place the inside rubber portion over the top of the lid and turn while holding in place; the grip will help to release the jar lid.
Put them on the end of a sharp object (like a knife or scissors) to protect from injuries. This can also be a good use in workshops where there is sharp machinery that people could accidentally walk into.
To keep a door knob from smashing into and damaging an interior wall, cut a large slit in a tennis ball and slide it over the knob. This trick also works great to keep curious toddlers out of off-limits room – at least until they figure out how to squeeze as they turn.
Use them to remove scuff marks from floors. Many janitors use this trick by placing a tennis ball on the end of a broom so it’s always handy.

,
Tennis balls have a great role in keeping the washing in good shape; just be sure to use clean tennis balls though:


Fluff up or separate laundry by throwing a couple into your clothes dryer. (Tennis balls stop sheets or other large fabric items from sticking together, therefore they dry faster and more thoroughly.) The laundry tennis balls can be kept in a small hanging bag for ease of reuse each time.
Put a tennis ball into your washing machine along with your shower curtain and 1/2 cup of vinegar, then wash with hot water. The vinegar will kill the mildew and the tennis ball will help to scrub the mildew off.
Add old tennis balls to the toilet tank to help reduce water usage when flushing.

,
Tennis balls can make garage and vehicle use easier:


Hang from the ceiling of the garage to help you tell where the wall is when you're backing up the car.
Cut a slit and use it to cover a trailer hitch.
Stick on the end of a bicycle kickstand to prevent it from sinking into the mud or grass.
When teaching road rules or cycling maneuvers to children, use tennis balls cut in half as miniature road cones.
Put tennis balls under the windshield wipers of vehicles that will be stored for long periods. This will help the blades last longer.
Use the time-tested method for finding your car in a crowded parking lot: put a tennis ball on the end of the antenna.
Old tennis balls can be used as safety bumpers for boats, especially for novice rowers. Simply cut in half and attach to potential bump points on each boat.

,
There are lots of great uses for tennis balls outdoors, including keeping the bugs away from your entertaining areas:


Cut in half and fill with beer to make a slug trap in the garden.
Keep certain types of gnats or flies away from you when you are outdoors. Just cover a tennis ball in Vaseline and hang it from a tree or bush.
If you find that the legs of your lawn chairs get stuck between the slats of your deck, put tennis balls on the bottoms to keep them where you want them.
Float two or three in your swimming pool to absorb body oils. Replace them every few weeks (the used ones can be used for another method in this article).
Cut the tennis ball open and slip over padlocks in the yard that are exposed to the weather. This will help prevent the padlocks from rusting or freezing over.
If you live in a wildfire prone area, keep a bucket of water and tennis balls in it. If a fire threatens your property, insert the soaked tennis balls into the downpipes and use a garden hose to fill the gutters with water. The water will dampen all debris in the gutters and may help to prevent your house from becoming more tinder for the fire.
Cut a ball in half and use as seedling containers for new plants.

,
They might not be able to provide fun on the court anymore but you can still get some good exercise use out of them:


Use the tennis balls as juggling balls.
Hang a ball from a string and use it for batting practice for baseball, cricket, or any other sport requiring a ball with a bat , stick or club.
Squeeze the tennis balls in your hand to improve grip strength.
Use as arm weights by cutting slits into a couple of balls and filling them with sand or pennies. This makes for great light weightlifting.
Tuck the tennis ball under your chin when swimming breaststroke and butterfly stroke; it will help you to remember to keep your chin tucked in.

,
Tennis balls can be great for art, craft and toys:


Decorate old tennis balls for an arts and crafts project. Draw on eyes, nose, mouth and glue on hair for a cute doll head or stick on countries of the world to make a globe. And don't be afraid to glue several balls together to create larger ornaments, creatures or objects.

Put a cigarette in the doll head's mouth (a fake cigarette is just fine). Giving it long dreadlocks can look really funny. This particular decoration is not so kid-project-friendly though!


Use tennis balls to store change. If it's decorated, this can make a neat gift.
Turn it into a dry eraser for a whiteboard by cutting in half and attaching a string through the middle. Attach the string to the board and use the furry outside to wipe clean the board!

Make puppets from old tennis balls. The ball could be a head or a body depending on the type of puppet you're making.
Hide stuff in old tennis balls. Make a slit in the tennis ball, then squeeze either side of the slit to open it up. Place money or other objects inside, and release to close the opening. Tuck away where it looks normal for a ball to be.

Make a solar system mobile using tennis balls. You'll probably need to add a few miniature tennis balls (often available from pet stores) to get the scale right.

,
Tennis balls have a number of useful possibilities when it comes to pets. Just make sure that split balls can't get caught on teeth, skin, fur or other parts of a pet. If this is a possibility, either cut the ball right open and just use the halves or prefer a whole ball instead. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Use old tennis balls as a dog or cat toy. There are lots of things you can do, include using it as it is for fetch and rolling games or decorating it with non-toxic markers and safe craft pieces to catch your pet's eye for chasing.
Tennis balls with holes drilled in them (about the size of a 10 cent piece) make excellent protective homes for field mice. Some wildlife projects use tennis balls for this purpose and add the balls to the wild for the mice to make homes in.As well, your own pet mice or hamsters may enjoy this type of home too.
Hang halves of tennis balls upside down in a rodent or bird cage as a swing or bed.
Ask your local animal shelter if they need tennis balls for their animals.

,
When tiredness or snoring gets too much, tennis balls can come to the rescue:


Place the old balls on the ground, sit comfortably and roll on them to massage any part of your body (feet, backs of legs, etc).
Balance on one leg and roll the tennis ball underneath the other leg. This is a good technique to improve your balance and get a massage as well.
Attach a pocket to the back of a snorer’s pajamas and secure a tennis ball inside. This will ensure that the snorer sleeps on his or her side - most people snore only when sleeping on their backs.

Relieve a tension headache as follows – place two tennis balls in a sock and tie each ball together side by side at the end of the sock. Find a hard surface such as a book and put the sock and balls onto the hard surface. Lay your head onto the tennis balls in the sock so that the balls sit on the nape of your neck where the head joins. Lie still for about five to ten minutes. When you get up, the headache will have lessened or even have gone in many cases.

,
There are a few musically inclined things you can do with tennis balls:


Put old tennis balls inside drums to reduce reverb.
Slit a tennis ball open, insert some beans or jingle bells, and seal closed with glue or rubber cement. Give it to a toddler as a musical instrument.

,
Even parties can benefit from old tennis balls.


Use tennis balls to anchor clusters of helium balloons at parties. Knot together a group of ribbons attached to balloons. Cut a small ""X"" mark in the top of a ball and insert the knot. Fill the ball with sand if you want extra security.
Cut slits into the balls and fill them candies. Place them on the table or into goodie bags.
Play party games with the old tennis balls; any game requiring balls can be played with these and they're safer for guests than hard balls.

Follow through your shot.",How to Hit a Backhand1," Most players choose to use either a one-handed or two-handed backhand very early in their training. Some find that using two hands on their backhand leads to a more accurate and powerful shot., Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net.

, Make a split step from the ready position to help you to get into position for the two-handed backhand. The split step is a small hop about an inch (2.5 cm) off the tennis court to load up in your legs. Your weight should be evenly divided over both your legs and they should feel like springs so that you can push off explosively to whichever direction you need.


Your split step should occur right before your opponent makes contact with the ball. This enables you to be ready to chase down the ball as soon as you know where it is going to hit.

, This is the first step of the two-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. From the split step take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot and putting all your weight on your left. As you step forward your body and shoulders will begin turning sideways.


All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot.
By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot.
Your arms should not be turning back during this step. They should stay directly in front of your chest. It is very important that your arms are not used during this step.

, The two-handed backhand grip uses a Continental grip for your dominant (right for right-handers) hand and a Semi-Western forehand grip with your non-dominant (left for left-handers) hand. The non-dominant hand will be just above your dominant hand. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders.


To achieve the Continental grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand out as if you are shaking hands with the racket. Place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, sloped side of the grip to the right of the flat side top, and close your hand around it squarely. The sloped side should go diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie.
To achieve the Semi-Western forehand grip you will place the bottom knuckle of your non-dominant hand on the bottom left slanted facet of the grip and close your hand around the grip. The same slanted face should point diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm beneath your pinkie.

, The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back and your shoulders are all the way sideways.


You should be looking over your shoulders at the ball at this point.

, These three things should all occur at once. Let your racket drop down as you push off with your back foot, lifting your heel off the ground. At the same time your upper body should rotate towards the net; lifting your heel will help you to rotate your upper body.


This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing.
You have the option of taking a small step forward with your front foot at the same time but this is optional. For beginners it is a good idea to take this small step forward at the same time.
Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height.

, Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. Your racket will follow a C shaped path as it travels towards the point of contact. You should make contact in front of your body.


Your upper body will rotate back towards the net as you make your swing.

, Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact. Make sure contact is made in front of your body and at waist height to enable you to maximize power and topspin. Your strings should be flat on the back of the ball and so directly facing the net.

, After the contact point you should extend the racket in the direction you are hitting and then rotate your upper body. Continue rotating your shoulders all the way through the shot, until you bend your elbows and bring the racket up over your shoulder.


You want your follow through to be one easy motion so that the deceleration of the racket is smooth.
Your shoulders should be facing the net by the end of your follow through.
Your racket should end up over your right shoulder when you are finished following through.

Work on your one-handed backhand if it feels more comfortable.,

Allow your non-hitting arm to straighten behind as you follow through.",How to Hit a Backhand2," The one-handed backhand is a beautiful shot but has become less popular in recent years. However, it is still used by many players such as Roger Federer as a powerful weapon in matches., Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net.

, This is the first step of the one-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. Start from the ready position and take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot. As you step forward turn your body and shoulders sideways so that they are now perpendicular to the net.


All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot.
By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot.

, Choose your grip based on the execution you want to achieve. The one-handed backhand will usually use an Eastern backhand grip to create topspin on the ball. Relax your dominant hand and use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip. Grip the racket with your dominant hand once more. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders.


To achieve the Eastern backhand grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand straight out directly above the grip. Bring it directly down so your base index knuckle rests completely on the top facet of the grip, and close your hand around it squarely.
An alternative grip includes the Extreme Eastern or Semi-Western Backhand grip. This grip is for use by stronger, more advanced players and is good for hitting high balls but not good for hitting low balls.
Another alternative grip is the Continental grip, which holds the racket at a 45 degree angle and is good for hitting slices.
The Semi-Western backhand grip is a rare backhand grip that is good for hitting heavy topspin but bad for hitting flat shots and slices.

, The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back and your shoulders are all the way sideways.

, Let your racket drop down as you straighten your hitting arm. At the same time step into the shot with your front foot. The drop of your racket creates the topspin on the tennis ball and is very important to your one-handed backhand.


This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing.
Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket as you complete this step.
Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height.

, Let go of the racket with your non-hitting hand after your racket is down and your hitting arm is completely straight. Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. You should make contact in front of your body.


Make sure your arm and the racket swing from the shoulder as a unit. This way your arm position relative to the racket does not change as you swing.
The racket should come as low as your knee right before you make contact with the tennis ball. This will produce the topspin that you want on your backhand.
Your upper body will rotate slightly back towards the net as you make your swing.

, Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact with the ball. Make sure contact is made in front of your body to enable you to maximize power and topspin.

, Keep the relationship between your arm and the tennis racket the same as you follow through. Continue lifting your arm and rotating your shoulders all the way through the shot, keeping your arm position the same.


The relationship between your arm and racket should not change until your hand is at the same level as your head.

, Your non-hitting arm should extend all the way back and behind you. This arm controls how much your shoulders and upper body rotate as you follow through.


Letting your non-hitting arm extend behind you limits the rotation of your upper body, helping you recover faster and stay balanced during your shot.

Allow your non-hitting arm to straighten behind as you follow through.",How to Hit a Backhand3," It is very difficult to get a proper topspin on very high or low backhanded shots so it is useful to learn the backhand slice for these occasions., Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net.

, This is the first step of the one-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. Start from the ready position and take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot. As you step forward turn your body and shoulders sideways so that they are now perpendicular to the net.


All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot.
By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot.

, The one-handed backhand will usually use a Continental backhand grip to slice the ball. Relax your dominant hand and use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip. Grip the racket with your dominant hand once more. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders.


To achieve the Continental grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand out as if you are shaking hands with the racket. Place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, sloped side of the grip to the right of the flat side top, and close your hand around it squarely. The sloped side should go diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie.

, The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back behind your head and your shoulders are all the way sideways. This back-swing is different from other backhands because you bring the racket over your back shoulder behind your head and you want the racket and your forearm to for an L shape.


This 90 degree angle or L shape between your arm and racket is very important for hitting the ball at the correct angle for the slice.

, This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing. You want to step with your front foot and transfer your weight from your back foot to your front foot. Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket and your arm in the same position in an L behind your head as you complete this step.


Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height.

, Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. Your arm will straighten as you swing the racket down on the tennis ball. You need to swing down on the ball to create backspin. You should make contact at waist-height slightly in front of your body.


In your back-swing your arm and racket formed an L shape. As you swing forward your elbow will straighten completely until your arm forms a V with the racket.

, Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact. As you swing towards contact your elbow will straighten out from the L shape of your arm and racket into a V shape between your arm and racket. As you make contact your strings should either be facing the net or at a slightly open angle.


Make sure contact is made at waist height slightly in front of your body to enable you to maximize power and backspin.
The combination of the downward swing and slightly open angle of the racket will create backspin on the ball.

, Allow your arm and racket to extend in the direction you are hitting after the point of contact. After extending forward allow your arm to come up, allowing it to slow down and stop. Your arm and racket should stay in the same position as you follow through.


This may feel strange because you had been bringing the racket down to meet the ball for the shot before bringing it up after the point of contact but it will actually occur naturally to slow down the racket.
The strings of your racket should end up facing the sky when you finish your follow through.
Look at your contact point during contact and as you complete your follow through your eyes should stay at that same point.

, Your non-hitting arm should extend all the way back and behind you. This arm controls how much your shoulders and upper body rotate as you follow through. You want your body to stay sideways during the follow through.


Letting your non-hitting arm extend behind you limits the rotation of your upper body, helping you recover faster and stay balanced during your shot.

Measure for the proper grip size.,
Choose a normal, 27-inch long racquet unless you want the added power of extended length racquets.,
Know the three major styles of tennis racquets.,
Buy a large, head-balanced racquet if you are a beginner.,
Purchase a less powerful racquet if you are big, athletic, or already a powerful hitter.,
Know the differences in racquet material when buying.,
Test out a few racquets before buying.",How to Choose a Tennis Racquet1," Adult grips range from 4 to 4 & 5/8ths inches. To find yours, measure from the middle line in your palm to the top of your middle finger -- this is your grip size, in inches.Another good rule of thumb is to hold the racquet in your dominant hand, like you would hold it to play. Slide the index finger of the opposite hand in between the tips of your fingers and the base of your palm on the racquet. If there isn't enough room for your index finger, the racquet grip is too small.
If there is a lot of extra room, the racquet grip is too large.
If you're between two sizes, choose the smaller one because you can always increase the circumference by adding an overgrip tape (a soft, padded, cloth-like tape wrapped around the grip).;
, The traditional length of racquet is about 27 to 28 inches (68.6 to 71.1 cm), but you can get longer racquets of up to 29 inches (73.7 cm). The longer the length of the racquet, the greater the leverage on a swing, therefore giving more power to a shot.


The trade-off, however, is that longer racquets are a little less maneuverable and difficult to aim.
Beginners should start with a normal, 27"" racquet.

, Depending on your needs, skill level, and style of play, you'll need a different racquet to reach your full potential. The three most common styles are:



Power/Game Improvement Racquets: Characterized by large heads, longer style, and light weight, these are mostly for beginners-intermediate players or anyone who wants a little more power on their shot.

Tweener Racquets: This well-balanced racquet is designed for all levels of skill and offer a good balance of power, control, and maneuverability.

Control/Player's Racquets: The professional design, these racquets have small heads designed for maximum control. The player adds in their own power to the shot. They can be long or short, and are generally heavier than other racquets., If you're starting to play tennis you want a forgiving racquet that allows for plenty of power without over-swinging. Choose a grip that fits you well and aim for a racquet near the following specs:



Head Size: 106-118 square inches.

Length: 27""

Weight: Lightweight, 9-10oz

Balance: Head-heavy, balanced towards the top., Even some beginners find the big, head-heavy rackets too much for them, especially if they are naturally athletic and powerful. The best way to adjust is to shrink the head size you purchase, leaving the other specs the same. A light, head-heavy racquet might still be desirable for control purposes when you're starting out., Most racquets are made from graphite because it is light-weight and powerful, making it perfect for any beginner. Other racquets suitable for beginners are made from aluminum or titanium, as these provide good power and comfort when hitting. Boron or Kevlar racquets are the lightest on the market, but they're also quite stiff and thus less forgiving on mistakes.


Beginners should stick to aluminum or graphite, but the material choice is also less important than if the racquet feels comfortable in your hands and if it suits your price range.
Aluminum is the cheapest racket, and they are usually heavy. However, they are also sturdy and dependable.
Boron, kevlar, and carbon fiber rackets are often much more expensive than their graphite counterparts., Take test swings and serves in the store and note how the racquet feels in your hand. Try and sample a broad variety of racquets when you first start looking -- from long and large power racquets to a few on the smaller end. For the best results, ask a few friends if you can sample their racquets next time you are on the court, and actually hit a few balls around to see what fits you best. Everyone's swing and style is a little different, which is why there are so many different types of racquet on the market.

Play a lot of tennis.,
Study.,
Hang out at the most busy public courts of the city.",How to Become a Tennis Instructor1," To teach something, you must at least do it well. Playing tournaments is the best way to keep getting better. If you don't have time for competition, at least work on all strokes for four hours a week.;
, Playing tennis is only half the job. You need to learn how to teach it. Your clients will be expecting their money's worth so you have to know how to manage the lesson time to get your points across and for the student to practice what you are teaching. The more you study the game of tennis and different teaching methods, the more likely you're going to find out how to get across the relevant information to a specific client.


Keep up with leagues and tournaments in your area and keep up with USTA rules and regulations.
Download and use tennis related apps to keep up with major tennis events, such as Wimbledon.
Borrow or buy good tennis guides and read these regularly. Tennis biographies can help give you star strategies and motivational stories to pass on to clients, tidbits that can help lessons to stick in the mind.
If you have trained under tennis coaches or clubs, be prepared to show your certificates of achievement. This will reassure clients that you know what you're doing. If you don't have any such training, consider getting some for this very purpose (see next).
Consider joining USPTA if you live in the United States. The United States Professional Tennis Association is a network that certifies tennis coaches. You will learn a lot about teaching others in the process of acquiring certification, as well as adding credibility to your resume. There are similar organizations in most jurisdictions.

, Just like fish in water, you should be very comfortable being around tennis players and facilities. Watch a person or group of people playing and imagine you're giving a private lesson to one of the persons or a group lesson. List drills or exercises you would give them and what they would accomplish. Also, consider what tips and metaphors you would use to help them visualize the tennis actions and perform better.

Know that a larger head size transfers more power to the ball.,
Choose head-heavy racquets for added power and stability.,
Consider your stringing pattern.,
Use flexible racquets for more power but less control.,
Check the beam width, the triangle under the racquet head, to gauge power potential.",How to Choose a Tennis Racquet2," The bigger the head, the more power you put on the ball (if everything else -- racket length, swing, etc.-- stays consistent). This is one of the biggest choices you'll make when picking a racquet, as more power frequently leads to less control. Do you typically over hit the ball, or do you want a little more power without altering your swing? Check your current head size and adjust accordingly.


Oversized and large heads are usually 106-118 square inches, but they can get as big as 120-30 square inches for power racquets.
Smaller control racquets usually have a head size around 85-94 square inches.
For beginners, shoot for something closer to 100 square inches or above., Head heavy racquets are best for baseline play and beginners and are usually found on power racquets. They are slightly weighted up near the top, and this makes them slightly less maneuverable. Intermediate and advanced players usually prefer a head-light or balanced racquet.


If you go for a lot of net play, try out a head-light racquet for its increased maneuverability.
If you're unsure what to get, or play a varied style of tennis, get a balanced racquet, which evenly distributes its weight., The racquet itself is not the only thing that affects your play. The way the strings are aligned, in either an open or closed (""dense"") stringing, will affect your power, control, and spin:



Open stringing offers more spin, which means you can hit the ball harder with top spin. These strings, however, are more likely to break.

Closed/Dense stringing offers more control for shot placement, and are better for beginners., A racquet flexibility is given by a rating from 0-100, with 100 being the stiffest option available. Most racquets fall between 45-75 on the scale:


Lower numbers indicate more control and spin, less power, and a more comfortable feel.
Higher numbers indicate more power, but also more vibrations in the racquet. Some beginners actually feel like they get more control on them because the lack of bend makes them feel a little more natural., A bigger beam width means you'll have more power on the racquet. This makes sense, since bigger beams are needed for larger racquets, but even control racquets have variable beam widths that affect how hard you can hit the ball.


For beginners, a good starting width would be between 23-27mm."
"
Get your equipment.,
Dress like a pro.",How to Become a Tennis Instructor2," Besides business cards, you will need two good quality rackets (always have an extra in case you break the strings), a ball hopper or basket that stands upright and that can hold at least 50 balls, cones, pen and paper, sunblock, sunglasses, hat and tennis attire.


It can be helpful to have a few extra rackets if possible, in case your clients have problems with their own. And it isn't unknown for a child to forget the racket in the rush of getting to the lesson on time!
Get newer balls if the ones you are using are getting too old. No one is going to pay much for a lesson with old, ugly and flat balls. Invest in new balls at least every month.

, Image is everything, and tennis is a sport that has some of the coolest looking sportswear. It doesn't have to be expensive but it must be tennis attire––there is nothing worse than a tennis coach wearing running shoes! Do your best to keep all clothing clean and wrinkle-free.


Carry extra shirts in case you get too sweaty.
If you have long hair, keep it back off the face. This presents a more professional image.
If you always look like a tennis player, people will associate tennis with you and that's always good for business.

Put your name out there.",How to Become a Tennis Instructor3," No one is going to know you are a tennis instructor unless you tell them. Every time you meet someone new, introduce yourself as a coach and give them your card. Also, tell everyone you know that you coach all the time, even if you don't. You never know, maybe even an ex or your boss has a passion for tennis you never knew about.

Open Twitter and Facebook accounts to promote your tennis business. Share updates about upcoming events, classes and tennis how-to tips. Find fellow tennis enthusiasts and follow them. Ask friends nicely (and sparingly) to help spread the word through their networks.
Make your own website. Have the details of availability, lesson types, costs, etc. all laid out for easy reading. It doesn't have to be complicated (in fact, the simpler the better), and there are plenty of free website making tools available.
Offer discounted lessons to begin building your client base. Have a scheme in place whereby existing clients get discounted lessons for referring new clients. This can all be displayed on your website and marketing materials––don't be too pushy face-to-face, clients will learn quickly enough that there are savings to be made by reading your site and materials.

Find courts where you can teach at.,
Talk about tennis.",How to Become a Tennis Instructor4," Many high schools, middle schools and colleges in the U.S. have tennis courts and you can teach at these at certain times. Make sure to ask for permission if the courts do not seem to be open to the public. Be sure to know when it is convenient to use each location. In addition, be sure to check on such aspects as lighting and court conditions.


If you need to pay for courts, factor this into the cost of lessons and make the most of each paid slot by having as many students as possible for the time, without shortchanging anyone. This means having a very good system in place for making appointments, keeping time during the lesson and dealing with ""no-shows"" (who should still be charged so as to cover your costs).

, After you get comfortable being at the facilities, start talking to the people often. Let them know that you are a coach and that you would love the opportunity to help them with their game. Do not be too pushy but rather interested in their game and excited to be talking about the sport.


Compliments are always a good way to start a tennis conversation.

Say no to playing but yes to teaching.,
Always say yes to teaching.",How to Become a Tennis Instructor5," When you start becoming a tennis coach, there is a possibility that a lot of people will ask you to play with them for fun. You don't have to be rude about it but be sure to let them know that your time on the court is valuable and it's how you make your living. You can always offer them a discount on the first lesson or something of the like to keep that person as a client.

, Saying no to lessons is the fastest way to lose clients. Even if the client seems unsure about whether or not it's something he or she wants to do, offering a discounted first lesson might be enough to sway the client in your favor.


Be prepared to teach both children and adults. This will open up as many opportunities as possible for you. Children tend to be fast learners but can be less motivated, especially if their parents ""made"" them do it, so you'll need some good motivational strategies, as well as making sure you pace the lesson to the child's attention span.

Prepare each lesson according to your client's particular needs, evident talent and remaining skill requirements.,
Give your games a name.,
Start enjoying the fruit of your work.",How to Become a Tennis Instructor6," Be prepared to tailor the lessons––something that works well for a group of 3.0 NTRP level ladies might not work as well with top ranked high school champs. Know your clients' age and skill levels, so you can plan the lesson accordingly. The effort you put in will be rewarded by the client's loyalty, as it will be clear you've made an investment in respecting your client's own needs.

, As you get better at coaching, you will start making up your own games and drills. These are great for advertising yourself, your specific skill set and making a special name for yourself. By giving names to your particular routines and games, your students will remember them for citing purposes and by word-of-mouth, you'll find more people get to learn about you and your teaching style.

, You are now a tennis coach, so enjoy being outside and make your work fun. Be open to all kinds of people and personalities because you will meet all kinds.


Give everybody a chance to be the best they can be. A coach is sometimes a very influential person in people's lives and your students will respect you if they can see that you respect your work.

Execute a surprise release.",How to Use a Compound Bow Release," Place the tail of the arrow firmly into the grip fingers on the string. Rest the body of the arrow on the ledge provided on the frame of the bow.;
, Make sure that the release mechanism wrist support is firmly and comfortably on the wrist of the bow arm. Clip the release mechanism to the thin loop of rope that extends back from the grip fingers on the string.

, Breaking the bow over will require a considerable pull which should be performed with the arrow pointing down.

, With the help of the release mechanism, pull the string back until it is at the jaw of the archer.

, Relax physically and mentally; then point the arrow at the target.

, The release mechanism will have either a thumb trigger or a finger trigger. Thumb release mechanisms are preferred by target shooters. Thumb releases are designed not to push down with the thumb, but rather to squeeze the entire hand. Finger triggers are commonly used by hunters. Start squeezing slowly and steadily.

, Avoid the temptation to rapidly squeeze the hand or jab with the finger. This will cause the bow assembly to jerk. Concentrate on keeping the arrow trained at the target while gently and steadily squeezing. The arrow will fire when everything comes into place, rather than at the precise moment of deciding to shoot. This type of release is called the surprise release. It is the most effective way to make sure that the arrow is aimed properly at the time of release.

Play a new game.,
Continue playing until you win the set or until you reach a tie breaker.

,
Play a tiebreaker if the score is 6-6.,
Start the scoring over to play the second set.,
Continue to play until someone wins 2 out of 3 sets.",How to Play Tennis1," Tennis is made up of games, sets, and matches. Traditionally, you must win 6 games (or, in special cases, 7) to win a set, and you must win 2 out of 3 sets to win a match. Here's what you need to know:Each game begins with 0 points (""love"") earned on each side. The first point won by a player is called 15, the second is called 30, and the third is called 40. If the first player has earned 40 points while his opponent has 30 or less, then he can win the game by winning the next point.
If both players have 40 points, then the score is called ""deuce,"" and they must keep playing until a player wins by two.
You must win a set by two games, so if you and your opponent are playing at 6-5 (you have won 6 games and he/she has won 5), then you must win the next game to beat him 7-5 for the set. If he wins the next game, then you are stuck at 6-6, and you must play a tiebreaker to determine who wins the set.;
, Before you can start playing tennis, you need to understand the layout of a tennis court. Here are the basics:


The tennis court has two sides that are separated by a net in the middle. Each court has two sides: the deuce side, or the right side of the court, and the ad side, or the left side of the court.
The court has alleys on either side, and if one player hits the ball in his opponent's alleys in a game of singles, he loses the point.
Each court has a right service box and a left service box. The server's goal is to serve the ball into the service box on the opposite side on his opponent's team. So, if the server is standing on the deuce side (the right side) of the court, he needs to serve the ball into his opponent's right service box.
Each player's court is framed by the baseline at the bottom and the singles sidelines on each side of the court. One player's ball must land on or within these lines of the opposing players court during a rally (any point after the serve) to be considered in.

, Start by standing on the deuce side of the court behind the baseline and serve the ball to the box that's across the net and diagonal to you. You have two chances to get your serve in. If you don't get your serve in the first time, it's called a fault; if you don't get it in the second time, it's called a double-fault and you've lost the point and have to move to the opposite side of the court.


If the ball hits the net and then bounces in to the service box, then it's called a ""let"" and you can play the point over again. If it hits the net and bounces back into your side of the court or outside the service box on the other side of the court, it's a fault.

, A winner means that the ball bounces in the court, but the person can't hit it back. An error means that you either hit the ball out of bounds or hit the ball into the net.


The winner of the first point gets 15. The loser of the first point is scored at ""love."" If the server wins, the score is 15-love. If the returner wins, the score is love-15. The server will always say their score first.

, Move to the ""ad"" (left-hand) side of the court. Serve the ball and play the point. The score proceeds 15, 30, and 40. The first person to exceed 40 by two wins the game.


If both players are tied 40-40, then they are at ""deuce.""
The player who wins the next point has the advantage (add in). If that player wins another point, then he or she wins the game.
If the player fails to win the advantage point, the score goes back to deuce. The game doesn't end until someone wins both an advantage and then a winning point.

, The opposite player serves the ball starting in the deuce court.

,, Here's how you do it:


Start with the player who did not serve in the last game. This player serves once.
The opposite player then serves twice. For the rest of the tiebreak, each player serves 2 points.
The tiebreak ends when a player reaches 7 and is leading the other player by 2 points. If a player reaches 7, and the other player is at 6, then they have to continue to play until the winner beats the other player by 2 points.

, Play the second set just as you played the first.

, The winner of 2 sets wins the match. In professional tennis, women have to win 2 out of 3 sets while men have to win 3 out of 5 sets. In high school and recreational tennis, though, the standard is 2 out of 3 sets.

Grip the racket.,
Position yourself to hit the ball.,
Hit a forehand.,
Hit a backhand.,
Perfect your serve.,
Learn to volley.,
Return a serve.",How to Play Tennis2," The basic grip for the tennis racket is the ""Continental Grip,"" where you hold the racket just as you would hold a hammer, with the base knuckle on your index finger on the first bevel on the racket, putting the ""V' created by your thumb and forefinger on the top of the handle. For lefties, the knuckle should go on bevel No. 4. Though this grip is most ideal for serves and volleys, it's a good way to start.As you advance in tennis, you can use the Eastern or Western grip, which can help you hit topspin and add more power to your strokes.

, This is the most important part of hitting a ground stroke or a volley -- any stroke other than the serve, really -- is to position your body so that you can comfortably swing and hit the ball. If you reach out for the ball and are flat-footed on the court, you won't get to the ball in time or you won't be able to use your skills to your advantage.


Tennis is all about the footwork. Take dozens of little baby steps as you anticipate the ball so that you can comfortably swing the racket and hit the ball as it moves in front of you.
Of course, there will be times when all you can do is stick your racket out and hope to hit the ball in time. But for every other shot, making the effort before you hit the ball will greatly improve your game.

, Start by grabbing your racquet with your dominant hand, as though you're shaking hands with it. Here's how to do it:


Step forward with the foot on your non-dominant side. Turn at the waist and pull your dominant arm back to swing the racquet back behind you. You'll need to wind up to generate momentum for your forehand. Turn to the side so that your shoulder is pointing in the direction where you want the ball to go.
Swing your entire arm forward to hit the ball. Don't twist your wrist. Hit the ball in the center of your racquet strings, the ""sweet spot"" of the racket.
Bring the racquet across your body toward your opposite shoulder. This motion is called the follow-through. The racket should swing upwards at the end, to generate enough power to move the ball over the net. If you swing your racket across your body and end at your other side instead of your shoulder, the ball will go into the net.

, The 2-handed backhand is the easiest to master. Here's how to do it:


Grab your racquet with your dominant hand as though you're grabbing a hammer. Your dominant hand should be near the bottom of your racquet handle.
Grip your racquet with your non-dominant hand by placing your other hand above your dominant hand on the racquet handle.
Twist at the waist and pull your racquet back on your non-dominant side. Your dominant forearm should be facing the net. Turn at the side so your shoulder is pointing where you want the ball to go. Bend your knees to generate more power.
Turn at the waist and use the power in your non-dominant arm to hit the ball across the net. Bring your racquet to your non-dominant shoulder to follow through.
To hit a one-handed backhand, just hold the racket with your dominant hand and don't put your non-dominant hand on it. Bend at the knees to generate power and hit the ball in the center of your racket, just as you would with a two-handed backhand. If you can master this stroke, you can generate a lot of power, but it's harder to be precise.

, Stand behind the baseline near the center of the court with your non-dominant foot out in front of you. Hold your racquet in your dominant hand. Point your shoulder in the direction where you want the serve to go. You can bounce the ball on the ground a few times to generate stability. Here's what you do next:


Toss the ball straight up into the air with your non-dominant hand. Toss the ball just a little bit in front of you, high above your head. At the same time as you toss the ball, pull your racquet upward and position it behind your dominant shoulder.
Bend back at your waist, and bend your knees.
Hit the ball. Use not just your arm power but also the explosive power generated by straightening your back and your knees to propel the ball over the net. The ball should land in the service box that's diagonal to where you are standing.
Think of it as hitting the ball at the top of its arc, as if you're reaching over a fence to hit a ball just on the other side, creating an arc that powers the ball forward.

, Here's how to do it:


Forehand volley: Hold the racquet in your dominant hand. Hit the ball before it bounces with a downward motion. Pull your elbow toward your belly button and keep your racquet face open. You need to use a continental grip.
Backhand volley: Hold the racquet in your dominant hand with the back of your hand facing the net. Pull the racquet across your body and down, as though you're elbowing someone out of the way with your dominant elbow.

, To return a serve, stand on the side of the court that's diagonal to the court that your opponent is serving from. You can stand behind the baseline for a first serve and come in slightly in front of the baseline for a second serve.


Hold the racquet using both of your hands. Your dominant hand should be on the bottom of the handle. Holding it with both hands will put you in position to quickly execute the return when the serve comes at you.
Watch the server and try to anticipate where the ball will land on your side. When you see where the ball is going, move quickly to execute a forehand or backhand.
If the ball is coming too quickly for a good backswing, just stick out your racquet and block the ball back to keep it in play.

"
"
Hit an overhead.,
Put topspin on your strokes.,
Add slice to your repertoire.,
Learn to read your opponent.",How to Play Tennis3," An overhead is a shot where the other player lobs the ball up high over your head, and you aim to slam it down on his side so it's nearly impossible to return. To hit a perfect overhead, do the footwork to move around enough so that the ball is coming down just in front of your head, just as it would in a good toss for a serve. Treat it like a serve. Here's what you do:


Hold your racket back behind your head so it grazes your back with your dominant serving hand, and point at it with your free hand.
When the ball is at the same height as it would be for you to hit a good serve, slam it down over the net, just as you would do with a serve.
The overhead will generate a lot of power. You can aim the ball either right at your opponent or on the opposite side of the court, so he has no time to get to it.

, Adding topspin to your strokes can help the ball bounce higher and move faster. To use topspin, don't hit the ball head-on to the center of your racket, but use your racket to hit the side and then the top of the ball, thus making the ball spin in an upward arc instead of moving in a straight path. You should put topspin on your forehand and backhand, but not your volleys.


Learning topspin can also help you ""lob"" the ball over your opponent's head. To do this, hit the ball high up in the air, so that it lands on your opponent's court with enough fast topspin to bounce up over his head and out of his reach.

, Slicing the ball is a skill that allows you to change the direction of the ball, give it backspin, and to also slow down the ball in its path, in many times making lose enough momentum so that it just ""dies"" on the other player's court before he has a chance to get to it. This is particularly effective if you're up at net and your opponent is all the way at the baseline and won't have enough time to get to a ball that you slice just over his side of the court. Here's how you do it:


Hit under the ball instead of over it, slicing down on it so that it spins backward.
Finish the stroke with your racket swinging up, above the place where the ball was when you hit it.
Bend your knees and get lower to the ground to help the ball move in the right direction.
Use this shot to hit a killer ""drop shot"" when you're right at net, or to surprise your opponent with a new stroke in the middle of a rally when he won't have time to get to the slower, back-spinning ball.

, To truly master tennis, you have to understand that no two tennis players are exactly alike. To win at tennis, you have to be able to exploit your opponent's weaknesses and to not give him an opportunity to use his strengths. Here are some ways to do this:


Many players, especially beginners, are more comfortable with either a forehand or a backhand. If you notice that your opponent has a weak backhand, keep on hitting the ball to his backhand side until he gets frustrated. You can even serve the ball either to his forehand or backhand.
Many players either love or hate the net. If your opponent hates the net and loses most points up there, then hit short balls and get him up there as much as you can. If he goes up to net every chance he gets, hit the balls deep into the baseline so he doesn't have the opportunity to get up there.
Get to know your opponent's serve. Does he serve long and deep? If so, make sure you keep standing near the baseline so you you don't get crowded by the ball. Does he serve soft ""patty cake"" shots that barely hit the middle of the service box? If so, move up near the end of the service box. There's no need to stand so far back.
Study your opponent's mental state. Don't let your opponent see you get upset, or he'll take advantage of you. But if you see that he's getting more and more upset and is missing more and more shots, kick your game up a notch so you can win before he can mentally recover.

Play doubles.,
Play Canadian doubles.",How to Play Tennis4," Doubles is played with two players on each team. The scoring rules are the same and the court is used the same way, except in doubles, the alleys, or on either side of the court are considered fair game, unlike in singles, where hitting the ball into the alley lines is considered hitting it out. In doubles, each player still has to serve into the opposite service box and to hit the ball within the baseline or the outer edges of the alleys.


In doubles, typically one player serves while his teammate stands in the opposing service box on the other half of the court. So, if one player is serving from the right side of the court, his teammate should stand about in the middle of the service box on the left side of the same court, creating a diagonal line between the players.
On the serving side, the serving player continues to move back and forth from the right and left sides of the court after each point while his teammate moves back and forth between the two service boxes.
On the receiving side, the players don't move right and left but just move up and down, depending on whether they're receiving the serve or standing up at the net. For example, if the player on the receiving team was just standing near the right baseline to receive the serve, he would move up to the right service box for the next point.
Typically, the player on the receiving team who is up at net doesn't stand quite as close to the net, but keeps his heels on the bottom line of the service box.

, Canadian doubles is played when there are two players on one team and one player on the other team. The only variation between Canadian doubles and traditional doubles is that the team with two players can only hit the ball within the singles player's lines while the person on the one-player team can hit the ball within the doubles players lines, so that he has a bit of an advantage to make for not having a teammate.

Choose one designed for a recurve bow (not a longbow), and intended for your bow's length and draw weight. Confirm that the ends of the stringer fit snugly over your bow's limb tips.


Some sources recommend the ""pocket and saddle"" design for recurve bows, but ""double pocket"" stringers are also common.This guide covers both types.;
, Slide the string's large loop over the bow's upper limb, positioning the string on the correct side of the bow. Fit the smaller loop into the notch on the lower limb, double-checking that it fits snugly. Since the bow is in a relaxed position, the string should have plenty of slack.


The lower limb is on the heavier side of the handle.The bow's draw weight is usually marked on the lower limb.

, If your stringer has two pockets, the larger one fits over the lower limb. This should cover the small string loop, keeping it secure in the groove.


If this doesn't feel secure, wrap a rubber band tightly around the string loop., If your stringer has two pocket, place the small pocket over the upper limb tip. If your stringer has a saddle (a leather or rubber pad) on one end, slide this over the top limb and below the string loop. Position the saddle about 3 inches (8 cm) from the tip, just behind the string loop.Some saddles can be secured against the bow, while others require you to hold it in place. The dimpled surface should press against the limb to reduce friction.

, Hold the bow grip with your non-dominant hand. Hold it horizontally so your dominant hand is near the upper limb, holding the loose string loop in place. Position the bow so its limb tips point upward, with the bowstring and stringer underneath.

, Bend at the waist to lower the bow until the stringer (but not the string) touches the ground. Step on it with both feet, about shoulder-width apart.Use the balls of your feet, not the arches, or the cord may slip.If using a saddle bow stringer, use one hand to keep the saddle in place.
You may use one foot, but planting both feet gives you extra stability. This is particularly helpful for children and shorter adults.

, Take up the slack in the bow stringer and confirm you have a secure grip. Be prepared to pull upward, bending the bow limbs back toward the ground. Read the next step before you start this motion.

, At the same time you pull up on the bow, slide the loose string loop up until it fits into the notch near the tip of the bow.

, Run your finger over the string loop to confirm it's secure in the groove. Keep your finger over the string for the rest of this process, so you can stop if the string starts to slip off., Slowly lower the bow until the stringer is slack. Do not rush this step, or a loose string could slip off and slingshot the limb into your face.

, Immediately turn the bow so its limbs face away from you. Double check the string loops once again. If they aren't secure, stand on the stringer again to repeat this process. Keep your head back and turn it away from the string, in case the loose string snaps off.Do not point the limbs at a nearby person, or a mishap could cause an injury.

, If you used a rubber band in an earlier step, remove this as well. For best results, adjust your bow according to the instructions below before you shoot.


When you're ready to unstring the bow, attach the bow stringer the same way you did before. Step on the stringer and draw the bow up, then slide the upper string loop off the notch and down onto the limb. Slowly relax the bow.

, Imagine a line running from the top of your arrow rest to your bowstring, hitting the string at a 90º angle. Position your nocking point on the string about ½"" (1.25 cm) above this line, so your arrows are perfectly horizontal when nocked., If your bow or string are brand new, the string will stretch out a little. Expect it to adjust to its final stretch over the course of your first one or two shooting sessions. Alternatively, you can leave the bow strung overnight once to help it settle.Don't spend too much time adjusting the brace height (described below) until the string had adjusted.


Flemish twist strings stretch out more than endless loop strings.

, The brace height is the distance between the handle of the bow and the string. Measure this distance, then shoot a few arrows to see how your bow feels. A high brace height will slow down your arrows, while a lower brace height will make a loud, jarring noise on release.Ask someone to stand on the side and watch as you shoot. The noise and vibration are easier to judge from the side.

, If you think brace height needs adjustment, unstring the bow. Twist the string a few times to flex the limbs further, increasing brace height. Untwist the string a few times to lower brace height.Measure carefully and write down the number each time, along with notes about how the bow fires. You'll probably have to make several adjustments to find the perfect point, but after that you're set.


Most recurve bows shoot best with a brace height between 7.5 and 9.75 inches (19–25 cm).Replace the string with a smaller or larger string if you can't get it near this range, or if you have to twist more than 20 or 30 times.If you're having trouble getting your arrows to fly straight, buy a T-square to measure nocking point height and brace height more accurately.

Know that target shooting is good for all ages.,
Know that target shooting uses compound and recurve bows.,
Find a place to shoot.,
Learn to shoot.,
Buy your own equipment.",How to Take Up Archery1," It is a great way to bond with kids in particular.;
, These however, are purpose built for target shooting of arrows.


The recurve has one string that causes the bow to form a ""w"" shape. A longbow is simple bow that forms a ""u"" shape.
If you are a fan of the Hunger Games, note that Katniss uses a recurve bow.

, Most people will look for an archery organization or shooting range.


Target shooting clubs can be seen by looking at where competitions are held. Look for a range that holds a target meet in your area.
You can also find clubs on the FITA website.If you want to shoot outside of a range, get expert advice on how to set up a target that does not endanger others.


, Like anything, archery has some tricks and habits that it is best to learn when you start.


Ask for lessons. It is best to get a recommendation from a friend. If you don't know anyone to ask, you can talk to the archery range supervisor about lessons and instructors.
Instructors normally provide equipment, thus saving you the risk of buying your own before you know what you want.

, After a number of lessons, your instructor will aid you in buying your own gear.


There are many reasons not to buy equipment right away. In addition to styles of bow, you want to get the right weight and right draw length. You can take a guess what you want but many people change their mind once they get used to things.

Know that many hunters believe that bow hunting is much more sporting than using a gun to hunt.,
Know that hunting generally involves compound bows.,
Join a bow hunting club.,
Know that bringing down game with a bow and arrow is a challenge.",How to Take Up Archery2," In fact, some will take up bow hunting without ever doing actual hunting.

, Bow hunting takes concentration and just being good at hunting.


It is not a surprise that bow-hunters are more likely to subscribe to the rules of fair chaseand more likely to hunt for food.

, Compound bows have a string that wraps around with the aid of cams.


Compound bows are best for hunting because the arrow flies faster/farther and is more accurate. Compound bows often have sights that are used to visually assist the archer aiming the arrow at the target.
Compound bow hunters use arm and chest protectors, since a compound bow string has a lot of torque and can cause injury if you don't have protection. Larger breasted women often will use a shotgun instead for this reason.
Hunting can also use a re-curve bow or a longbow, but that is less common for reasons mentioned above.
Some enjoy using a crossbow.

, Hunting groups are pretty common in the USA. You can simply go to a hunting store near you and ask if they have a club.


Bow hunters will show you where they shoot. Shooting in the woods is different from being on a range, and takes getting used to.

, It doesn't matter if you are shooting deer, elk, pigs/javelina or more exotic game.

Check the old bow string for any irregularities.,
Select and wax a new bow string.,
Choose a double pull compound bow press that is safe for your bow.,
Place the bow into the bow press.,
Determine whether to remove the old string first.,
For non-teardrop systems, thread the new string starting with a cam.,
For teardrop systems, thread the new string's loops onto the empty grooves of the teardrop.,
Re-tighten the bow and slowly remove it from the bow press.",How to String a Compound Bow1," If the old string has serious faults, it could break during removal and cause serious injury. If the string is severely worn, consider bringing the bow to a professional for restringing.






;
, Consult your bow's manufacturer or packaging information to find out whether the use of certain strings will void your warranty.Once you know which strings are safe, you can select from a variety of synthetic materials with different attributes, including Dacron, Vectran, and Dyneema. Even a slight glitch can make the restringing process dangerous and unsuccessful, so discard any string with bumps, cracks, or other irregularities. Rub bow wax over the string before continuing to make it easier to attach and use.









Note: Be sure to purchase a bow string, not a bow cable. Bow cables are intended for operating pulleys and applying additional pressure to the bow limbs, not for shooting arrows.

, Many compound bows cannot be safely strung without a specialized ""bow press"" to hold the bow in place and bend the limbs in the appropriate position. Consult a professional or your bow's manufacturer to confirm what size and type of bow press is safe for your bow, as they come in many different forms.









Modern ""double-pull"" presses that pull the riser, or center portion of the bow, in two locations are much less likely to damage the bow than ""single-pull"" style presses.
If your bow has past-parallel limbs, which have a more significant outward curve, you will need a specialized bow press., If you are not familiar with a particular model of bow press, finding experienced supervision is highly recommended to avoid injury to yourself or the bow.Most bow presses require you to loosen the weight-adjustment bolts on each limb by five to seven turns first, but beyond that they can vary greatly. A bow press may have restraining arms that lock over the bow, bolts that tighten your bow's limbs in place, a series of locks over the limbs and handgrips, or some combination of the above.









Note: Always loosen your compound bow by alternating limbs with each turn. If you loosen one limb by several turns before you have begun to loosen other limb, you risk breaking your bow or causing an accident due to the unequal pressure.

, Bows with a ""teardrop' attachment point, which has two grooves for slipping on a string, should be stringed while the old string is in place. Bows without this attachment should have the old string removed before the new one is attached, unhooking the string from each cam or idle wheel at the end of each limb.








Ask an experienced archer if you cannot identify a possible teardrop attachment.

, Attach the end loop to the appropriate post in the center of a cam. Loop the string under the cam and back over, slotting it into the groove. If your bow has two cams, perform the same action in reverse on the other cam. If it is a single-cam bow, loop the string around the idler wheel on the other limb, then back down to attach the other end to the cam.









If your bow has a single cam with a post on either side, attach the first end loop to the post on the side of the bow with the sight window.

, Attach the first end loop of the new string over the empty groove on one side of the teardrop. Do the same with the end loop and teardrop near the other limb, making sure both loops remain firmly seated. You may now remove the old string from the other side of the teardrop.








, Tighten the bolts to their original setting, alternating by turning one and then the other. Slowly release the bow from the bow press, watching to make sure the string remains properly seated in the correct grooves. If there is any sign that the string is not correctly seated, stop, fasten the bow press again, and adjust the string.

Identify whether your bow can be restrung by hand.,
Loosen the limb bolts slightly.,
Step on the old string and lift the bow.,
Slip on the new string over the unoccupied sides of the teardrops.,
Lower the bow, then step on the new string to remove the old one.",How to String a Compound Bow2," The only compound bows that can be restrung by hand are older models with a ""teardrop"" shaped attachment for the string. These attachment points have two grooves in order to hold two strings at once, allowing you to use the old string to keep the bow in position while you attach the new one. Many of these can still be placed in a bow press for safer stringing.No compound bow can be safely strung by hand if there is not an old string present.










No other type of compound bow should ever be strung without a bow press. Even if you have successfully managed it before, you risk releasing several hundred pounds of pressure and causing serious injury.
If your teardrop bow has not been used in some time, take it to a professional archery shop rather than trying to string it yourself. Old, potentially damaged cables or strings could break and cause injury during restringing.

, Turn the top bolt one turn counterclockwise to loosen that limb, then do the same for the opposite limb. Repeat an additional one or two times, alternating limbs, to make the limbs slightly looser.








, Hold the bow in one hand and step on the old string. Lift the bow up to flex the limbs. Do not pull the bow back to its full draw length; you only need to flex the limbs close enough together to attach the new string.








, The teardrop on each limb of the bow should have two grooves, one with the old string and one empty. Slip the end loops of your new string over the empty grooves. Make sure they are firmly attached and taut.








, Lower the bow slowly to its normal position. Step on the new string this time, partially drawing the bow back up toward you as before. Unhook the old string from each teardrop.

Purchase a bow stringer.,
Place the large pocket over the lower limb.,
Place the small pocket or saddle over the upper limb.,
Hold the bow horizontal.,
Stand on the stringer cord with both feet.,
Lift the bow until the string is slack.,
Unhook the bowstring from the upper end.,
Remove the string from the lower limb.,
Lower the bow slowly.,
Remove the string and stringer.",How to Unstring a Recurve Bow," These cheap devices are simply a length of cord with a leather pockets at each end, or with one pocket and one pad or ""saddle."" Using a bow stringer is by far the safest way to string and unstring your bow. Find a bow stringer designed for recurve bows, not longbows, at an archery shop or some sporting goods stores.

Trying to unstring your bow by hand comes with a high chance of injuring yourself when a bow limb slips and catapults toward you at high speed. Even experienced archers can break their bows when unstringing by hand, or warp the limbs over time.;
, Double pocket stringers have one pocket that's noticeably larger than the other. Place this one over the lower limb of the bow, making sure it fits snugly. (If you are using a pocket-and-saddle stringer, place the pocket on this end.)

, If using a double pocket stringer, pull the smaller pocket over the upper limb tip. For a pocket-and-saddle stringer, loop the saddle end over the upper limb, then place the saddle (pad) against the curved portion of the limb, just below the string nock.


Some bow stringers require you to hold the saddle in place with your hand for the rest of the process.

, Hold the bow with your dominant hand near the upper limb tip, and your other hand on the central handle. Position it to the string side is closest to the ground, and parallel to it., Lower the bow until the stringer cord (not the bowstring) rests against the ground. Step on it with both feet, about shoulder width apart. Make sure your feet are stable and the stringer cord is secure beneath them.], Gradually pull upward on the bow from the handle. The bowstring should become slack as the stringer takes up the tension.

, Lift the slack bowstring out of the upper nock. To prevent it dragging on the ground, leave it hanging slack on the upper limb.

, Unhook the string from the lower limb nock as well., Gradually lower the bow. The stringer cord should become slack, and the limbs should remain in a relaxed position., Wrap up the bowstring and store it in a container to preserve its twists. Remove the bow stringer as well."

Know when to use this method.,
Hook the crossbow string onto one nock.,
Angle the crossbow on a hard surface.,
Apply pressure to the bow using your foot.,
Pull up on the barrel of the crossbow.,
Nock the other end of the string.,
Check your work.,
Remove the string using the same process.",How to String a Crossbow1," This method requires you to use more arm strength and is easiest when done on crossbows with a lower draw weight.Your weight and strength will also determine how easy this method is. You will need to apply more force when using this method, so the heavier and more muscular you are, the easier it will be.
Note that this method cannot be used on a compound crossbow with a pulley at the end.;
, Hook one side of the crossbow string onto one nock on the bow. The other side should be loose and the other nock should be empty.


Make sure that the loop of the bowstring is properly seated inside of this first nock.

, Place the nocked side of the prod (bow) on the floor or a similar hard surface. Tilt the crossbow so that the empty nock it tilted upward toward your dominant hand.


Steady the butt (the back of the barrel) with your non-dominant hand as you tilt the bow.
Hold the loose end of the string with your dominant hand as you position the bow. Grabbing it now will make it easier for you to maneuver it later.
When you are indoors, a hard floor will usually suffice. If you are stringing the crossbow outside, however, you should prop it against a wooden block. When a wooden block is not available, take off your shoe and set it on the ground (with the sole facing up) and prop the crossbow against that.
If using a block of wood, you could even drill a shallow hole into the center of the block to help prevent the prod from slipping around as you work. If you do this, place the nocked tip of the prod directly inside that hole.

, Carefully step on the prod part of the weapon, positioning your foot just next to the barrel on the side of the prod opposite your nocked end.


It is easiest to use your dominant foot while doing this.
Lean into the bow as you do this to maximize the amount of pressure you apply.
Consider stepping on the prod with your bare foot to avoid any accidental damage to the prod.Keep your foot as close to the center of the prod as possible. Doing it this way will help the prod bend evenly.
If your crossbow has a stirrup, do not put any pressure on it. Doing so could warp or otherwise wreck it.

, Slide your dominant hand down a little onto the barrel of the crossbow. Grab onto the barrel and pull it up, toward your torso.


Continue applying pressure with your foot as you do this.
You should see the prod bending once you apply enough pressure to both the prod and the barrel.
Your non-dominant hand should be pulling up on the empty end of the prod from the front to help bend it toward you.

, Slip the loose end of the string onto the empty bow nock.


You will likely need to release the barrel of the crossbow and use your dominant hand to hook the string onto this second nock.

, Pick up your crossbow and examine both nocks. The string loops should be securely in place for each side.


If the string is not secure in both nocks, attempting to fire your crossbow will likely be unsuccessful and may even be dangerous.

, Bowstring removal is done in the same way, but in reverse.


Position the on the ground in the same way as before and apply the same sort of pressure.
Unhook the string from the bow nock facing you.
Pick up the crossbow and unhook the string from the other nock.

Use this method for any crossbow.,
Place one end of the bowstring in place.,
Place the stringer on both ends.,
Cock the crossbow.,
Hook the other end of the bowstring in place.,
Fire the crossbow.,
Remove the other end of the stringer.,
Check your work.,
Reverse the process to remove the bowstring.",How to String a Crossbow2," This method can be used with any crossbow regardless of the draw weight and the amount of strength or body mass you have.


As a general rule, using a stringer is safer and easier than stringing a crossbow without one. This method can take a little longer, however.

, Loop one end of the actual string in one nock of the bow.Keep the crossbow lying flat on the ground or on a working surface as you do this.

, Hook one end of the stringer onto the loaded nock of your bow, directly on top of the bowstring. Draw the stringer behind the prod of the crossbow and hook the other end onto the other nock.


Note that the bowstring must be shorter than both the bow span and the crossbow stringer, which is why the bowstring itself cannot be hooked directly onto both ends without the application of pressure. The crossbow stringer should be roughly the same length as your bow span, however.

, Tilt the crossbow so that it stands vertically with the barrel pointing up. Pull the stringer back and hook the center of it into the latch of the crossbow.


If the crossbow has a stirrup, place your foot in the stirrup as you draw the stringer back and cock it in place.
The stringer essentially serves as a weak crossbow string. It should be easier for you to cock it, making it easier for you to bend the bow far enough to load the real bowstring on.

, Pick up the loose loop of the actual bowstring and hook it into its appropriate nock.


Make sure that the loop of the bowstring is beneath the loop of the stringer. It can take some time, concentration, and effort to maneuver the bowstring loop underneath the stringer loop.

, Release the safety and pull the crossbow trigger to fire the empty crossbow. When you do this, one end of the stringer should naturally fall off.


If loaded correctly, both ends of the actual bowstring should still be in their correct places.

, Slowly remove the other end of the stringer from the other nock, working with care to avoid accidentally removing or loosening the bowstring, as well.


The stringer and bowstring will likely be intertwined at this point, making removal a bit tricky.
You may need a flat screwdriver or similar tool to help you pry the stringer off.

, Look at both nocks of your crossbow to verify that the bowstring is seated securely in each one.


An improperly seated bowstring can be a safety hazard.

, If you need to remove the bowstring, attach the stringer to both nocks and cock the crossbow with the stringer instead of the actual bowstring. Unhook both ends of the actual bowstring, then fire the crossbow and remove the stringer off both ends by hand.


You may also opt to only unhook one end of the bowstring while the crossbow is cocked. If you do this, the other end can be removed when you take the stringer off.

Take arrow and lock it on string with the cock (odd colored feather) facing away from the bow.,
Bend your arm at the elbow (wear an armguard of hardened leather) so that the string doesn't get under the armguard and bite you.,
Once the arrow is locked on the string, hold the string with your index, middle, and ring fingers, with the arrow between your index and middle.,
Hold your bow firm and pull back with your fingers.,
Focus your attention on the smallest spot you can find on your target and let nothing else distract you.,
Relax the fingers of your right hand to let the string slip past them.,
Hold your stance until the arrow hits the target.

",How to Shoot an English Long Bow,";
, This is called string slap, and can be very painful.

, Don't squeeze the arrow; pull on the string and the arrow will hold itself in place.

, Draw the arrow to a comfortable spot on your face (called an ""Anchor point""). Make sure you always draw back to the same anchor point or your shots will become too inconsistent. Some draw to their chin with the string running up across the tip of their nose. Others draw to the back end of their jawbone, while others find it comfortable to rest the arrow up on their cheekbone, near their eye. In this form of ""instinctive"" shooting, it is most common to draw to the corner of the mouth. These spots on your face are called your ""anchor point"". Find one that is comfortable for you, and stick to it. A consistent anchor point is key to accurate, consistent shooting.

, If you have a target with rings on it, focus on a blemish on the target within the centermost ring. If it is an animal, pick an off-colored hair to focus on. The smaller the better. Pull back and hold until that spot becomes clear and all else around it becomes a blur. This can be anywhere from about one second after drawing the bow, to the moment you contact with your anchor point.

, This prevents the bow from jumping or lurching, which will throw off your shot.

Set aside a few days.,
Buy the sight.,
Mount the sight to the bow.,
Set all sighting pin adjustments to the mid-point.,
Set up the target and mark your ranges.",How to Sight a Bow In1," You will want to spread your sighting in over a few sessions. This is because fatigue will affect your accuracy and power, and your form will most likely shift. Spreading out the sighting over a few days will result in greater overall accuracy.;
, Bow sights come in many styles and should be chosen to meet the preferences of the archer. Bow sights are available at sporting good stores and specialized archery supply outlets. If you're just planning on hunting with the bow, you can use a simple sight that should only set you back around $40. Competition sights can cost 5 times this or more.


This guide is for sighting in a fixed-pin sight. It is the most common sight and is recommended for hunting and recreation.

, Follow the instructions provided with the sight for proper installation. Most sights are attached to the riser and are secured by a couple of screws. Most bows have pre-drilled holes for attaching sights. Do not overtighten the screws, as you could damage the bow. The sighting pins of the sight should be lined up vertically with the bow string.


The bow sight should be at a right angle to the bow.
After installing the sight, let it settle overnight. You may have to tighten it further after it settles.

, This will give you maximum room for adjustment in either direction as needed. An Allen wrench, available at hardware stores, will be needed to adjust the sighting pins.

, Ideally you will want to be able to mark off every 10 yards (9.1 m) from the target, at least up to 40 yards (36.6 m). Use a range finder if possible for accuracy. Range finders are available from hunting and outdoor supply stores.


Try to use a durable target that can take a lot of arrows, as sighting in the bow can take some time and a lot of repetition.

Move back to 40 yards (36.6 m).,
Check your 20 yard (18.3 m) shot again.,
Move back and sight any additional pins.",How to Sight a Bow In2," Move to the closest distance to the target, which is usually the 10 yard (9.1 m) mark. Stand so that your body is perpendicular to the target, and draw an arrow back with your bow. Look down the sight at the top pin and shoot your arrow at the target. Repeat with a few more arrows.


Take note of where the arrows hit compared to the site. If the arrows went above what the pin was indicating, move the sight box up on the bow.
Repeat this step until the arrow is not shooting above the top pin.
Step back to 20 yards (18.3 m). Repeat the sighting process, raising the sight box if necessary. Once the arrows are not hitting above the top pin, you can make adjustments for arrows going too far left or right by moving the sight left and right respectively.
Don't worry about perfect accuracy yet, this pin will most likely change.

, Once you deem your 20 yard (18.3 m) top pin suitably accurate, you can move back to the 30 yard (27.4 m) mark on your range. Aim down the sight using the second pin and fire off a few arrows at the target. Start making the same adjustments that you made while sighting in at 20 yards (18.3 m).Remember to move the entire sight box when making adjustments at this stage.
Take the time to make the 30 yard (27.4 m) pin as accurate as possible, because it will not be changing. This will be the anchor of your sight.

, Shoot arrows at the target while looking at your 40 yard (third) pin in the sight. When you make you adjustments this time, move the pin itself instead of the entire sight box. You won't be moving left and right with the sight box anymore; instead focus on making the 40 yard (36.6 m) arrow go to exactly where the pin is pointing.The distance between the 30 and 40 yard pins will be greater than the distance between the 20 and 30 yard pins.
If you need to readjust your left and right sight placement, return to the 30 yard (27.4 m) marker on the range and make your adjustments there.

, Once you've set the 30 yard (27.4 m) pin and made adjustments to your 40 yard (36.6 m) pin, go back and shoot at 20 yards (18.3 m) again. This time, make adjustments to the pin itself instead of the whole sight.

, Depending on your sight, you may have additional pins for 50 yards (45.7 m), 60 yards (54.9 m), and more. Move back from the target and repeat the previous steps, moving the pin to make adjustments."

Attach the release to your dominant wrist using the velcro straps.,
Place the arrow on or through the rest, depending on the style of rest your bow has.,
Rotate the arrow so that one vane is facing upward and press the nock onto the bowstring in the center of the string loop until it snaps into place.",How to Shoot a Compound Bow1," You want the mouth of the clamp facing away from your body so that you can attach it to the bowstring.


While you can shoot a compound bow without a release, using a release is safer and easier on your fingers.;
, If it is a ""biscuit"" style rest, the arrow will slide directly through the rest, but with any other type of rest, the arrow will simply sit on top of the rest.

, Vanes are the fins on the end of the arrow that are usually brightly colored.


This step is called nocking the arrow and ensures that the arrow does not contact anything other that the rest and the string when it is shot.

, Try to pull the string back in a single, smooth motion, keeping your arm steady.

, This is called your anchor point and is the point at which the arrow is drawn furthest back before release.

, The peep sight is located on the bowstring itself and the forward sight, which is made of a several pins and a balance level, is located on the front of the bow.


The forward sight pins are pre-set to distances with the highest pin set at 20 yards (18.3 m) and the lower pins working out, usually in 10-yard increments. You want to set your pin to the same distance that exists between you and your target.
Make sure you can see through the peep sight and line your target up with the pin that you just set on the forward sight.
Check to make sure that the bubble in the level on the forward sight is resting exactly in the center.

, Do your best to hold the bow steady and keep your dominant hand pulling straight back as you release.

Decide if you’ll use your bow primarily for target archery or for hunting.Your bow will need a higher draw weight for hunting.;
, Draw weight on a bow correlates to how hard you have to pull in order to draw back the string on the bow. To select your ideal draw weight an adult beginner should start between 18 and 24lbs of draw weight. Children should start even lower. Choosing a low draw weight will result in less speed and power in your shooting but will allow you to get proper form and technique.
If you're a beginner, shoot with a lighter bow with regard to the draw weight. Don't choose a bow that's too hard to pull back. If it seems too easy, move up a weight.
Younger people should also choose a lower draw weight.

, Bows come in different lengths. The average teenager and adult should use a 66 or 68 inch bow. , A take-down bow is one that dismantles for easy portability. The bow’s two limbs can be separated from the rest of the bow. This also allows for easier servicing of the bow.


A take-down bow also makes the draw weight flexible. You don’t need to buy a whole new bow if you decide to raise your draw weight; rather, you’d just need to purchase new limbs for the bow., It is a good idea to see how well you can hold and shoot a bow before you settle on purchasing it. Try out some different options at a local archery shop. This place will likely have several sample brands and styles.

, If you are going to purchase a bow, consult an expert at the sporting goods store to fit you for a bow that takes height, draw strength, and handedness into consideration.

, Your draw length is the length that your arm can draw the bow string back in order to shoot the arrow. Spread your arms out to either side of your body and hold them parallel to the ground. Have someone measure the exact number of inches from one middle finger tip on one arm to the middle finger tip on your other arm. Divide this number by 2.5. This gives you your approximate draw length, it should be checked by a professional before you purchase anything. Your arrow length will be 1-2 inches more than your draw length.

, Most arrows are made of either fiberglass or carbon, which keeps them relatively lightweight. The arrow weight can vary in the shaft. The heavier the arrow shaft, the deeper it will sink into a target. If you are using an arrow for target practice, you don’t need the arrow to sink in very far. If you are using it for hunting, however, you do need the arrow to sink in through skin and bone.

, If you are planning to get arrows for hunting, make sure they have suitable heads made of strong material with good piercing power.

, Shooting a recurve bow is not as simple as picking up the bow and some arrows alone. If you plan on practicing someplace like your backyard as opposed to a range, then you will need to purchase a suitable target that won’t ruin your arrows. Targets are available online or at sporting goods stores.


Alternately, make your own target with 2 firm hay bales. Wrap them in shade cloth to tighten them up., An armguard goes on the forearm of the arm that's holding the bow. Its purpose is to protect your arm if the string hits it. These can be purchased at sporting goods stores, outdoor stores and online.

, A finger tab is a strap of leather that protects your fingers from the tension of the string as you pull it back. Your finger tab goes on the fingers that will be drawing back your bowstring with your pointer finger above the arrow and middle and fourth below. You can also touch your thumb to your pinkie behind the string to keep them out of the way., Depending on the bow you rent/purchase, it may or may not come with additional parts helpful for beginners, such as a sight and a clicker. A clicker should really be avoided for a beginner as proper technique is best achieved without it. , If you are right-handed, stand with your left hip pointing toward the target (vice versa if you are left-handed). Keep your body remains vertical. Don’t lean to one side or the other. Rather, imagine that your body is aligned with a center vertical line to keep yourself straight.

, The shooting line is a line that marks a particular distance from the target. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, centering yourself over the shooting line.Keeping your feet firmly planted at shoulder-width also maximizes your stability as you shoot.

, Look directly at the target by turning your head toward it. Be sure not to turn the rest of your body, which should instead remain perpendicular to the target. Keep your chest in and shoulders down, making sure not to hunch up your shoulders., If you are right-handed, hold the bow with your left hand on the hand grip. Most recurve bows have handles, so you will know where to hold the bow.


The thumb and index finger should turn slightly inward, while the rest of your fingers on this hand should be relaxed. Your wrist should also be relaxed.
Don’t hold your bow with a death grip. This will cause inaccuracy in your shooting.Stay relaxed so that every movement will be smooth.

, You need to load the arrow by fitting the notch in the end of the arrow onto the bow string. Do this before lifting your bow and without actually drawing the string. This is called ""nocking"" the arrow.

, As you lift, ensure that the arm holding the bow is straight and locked at the elbow.If your elbow is bent at all, it will be much more difficult to draw the bow.


Keeping the elbow of your bow arm straight additionally helps to keep your arm away from the bow string as you release., You should pull back far enough that your hand rests right under your jawbone. Your bowstring should nearly touch your face around the corner of your mouth.Check again as you draw back that you are not twisting your torso to face the target.


Try to practice letting the stronger muscles in your back do most of the work as you draw the bow as opposed to your arm muscles., You want to aim with your dominant eye while keeping your other eye closed.Your dominant eye is much more reliable for your aim to the target.


If your bow has a sight, use the notches in the sight to help you line up your target. Also check your aim with your eyes.

, Don’t jerk the string back, or the arrow won't fly straight. Keep your release as smooth and gentle as possible, thinking of the action more like relaxing your fingers off the string as opposed to letting it go.Don't move your hand or arm while you shoot. ""Helping"" the arrow doesn't actually help at all.

, Once you release the string, the arrow still must accelerate off the bow, and any movement during the fraction of a second can disrupt the intended flight path of the arrow. Train yourself not to jerk or flinch by holding your position until you hear the arrow hit the target."

Place your trampoline in a flat, open area.,
Cover metal edges and hooks with pads.,
Enclose the trampoline with safety nets.,
Use soft material around the trampoline.",How to Stay Safe when Using a Trampoline1," The ideal location for your trampoline is one out in the open, away from any trees or objects that you might hit while jumping. You also should keep the ground clear for several feet around the trampoline.Removing any objects within 8 feet (2.4 m) of the trampoline in all directions.
The ground under and around the trampoline should be as level as possible to keep people from jumping too high or causing the trampoline itself to flip over.;
, Invest in a trampoline that comes with safety pads, or find safety pads that will fit the trampoline you want right away. Hitting the metal edge of the trampoline frame is one of the easiest ways to get hurt.Without pads, your feet also can get caught between the springs of the trampoline, causing injury. Safety pads prevent this.
It's best if the color of the cover contrasts sharply with the color of the frame. This way you can easily see if the cover has been disturbed., The safety net keeps someone from being bounced off the trampoline onto the ground, or from hitting the metal parts of the frame while they are jumping.Make sure the net is high enough that people will not routinely jump higher than the top of the net. You may need to get a higher net if there will be larger adults using the trampoline who are able to jump higher than children.
Don't extend the net to cover the space under the trampoline. Otherwise you may have difficulty keeping the area under the trampoline clear.

, If you have soft, spongy grass in your backyard, you don't have to worry about lining the ground around the trampoline with anything else. However, you should never place a trampoline on a hard ground surface such as concrete.Look for sand or wood chips. Any material commonly used around playground equipment can also be used around a backyard trampoline.
The purpose of this material is to prevent serious injury if someone should fall off the trampoline onto the ground.

Check the surface of the mat.,
Remove jewelry before jumping.,
Check for objects under the trampoline.,
Always land in the center.,
Avoid dangerous stunts.,
Take turns.,
Use the trampoline ladder.",How to Stay Safe when Using a Trampoline2," Before anyone uses the trampoline, make sure the mat is in good condition and doesn't have any rips or tears. It also should be completely dry. Wet spots on the surface of the mat can be slick and cause jumpers to lose their footing.If you live in an area that gets snow in the winter, you may want to take your trampoline down during the winter months and store it somewhere more protected. This will protect the mat from the elements.

, Before you start jumping, make sure you're not wearing anything that could get caught or tangled while you're jumping. Simple jewelry that seems harmless may become a nuisance when you start jumping.In addition to jewelry, avoid hanging drawstrings or other objects on your clothing. Your pants should be short enough that you won't get your feet tangled in them.
Remove everything from your pockets, otherwise it will fly out when you start jumping and could cause injury.

, Any objects under the trampoline can interrupt your bounce, causing you to stumble. To stay safe when using your trampoline, remove any objects stored underneath.There also is a risk that sharp objects underneath the trampoline could damage or puncture your mat.

, Your trampoline should have a circle or bull's-eye mark at the center. When you're jumping, the center is the safest place for you to land. This is where you'll get the most predictable bounce from the trampoline.When you're jumping too close to the edge, you run the risk of being bounced out of the trampoline, onto the metal frame or out onto the ground.

, You may have seen videos on the internet of people doing amazing stunts on their backyard trampoline. Enjoy the videos, but don't try anything you see on your own trampoline if you want to stay safe.Also stay away from gymnastics moves, such as somersaults or flips, unless you have training and know how to do them properly.

, Even on larger trampolines, the best way to stay safe is to make sure that only one person is using the trampoline at a time. When several people are jumping at the same time, they run the risk of collision.The more people are jumping on a trampoline, the further out to the edge people have to jump. When only one person uses the trampoline at a time, everyone can jump at the center.
If you have several kids who want to use the trampoline, set a timer and give each of them the same length of time to use the apparatus.
Make sure kids on trampolines have adult supervision. Even if you are an adult, it's best to have someone else with you when you use your trampoline, to act as a spotter in case you misstep.

, Most trampolines have a ladder for you to use when you enter and leave the trampoline surface. Bouncing and flipping dismounts are a good way to get injured on the trampoline.Remove the ladder and store it safely when the trampoline is not in use. This can help prevent people from getting on the trampoline without your consent.

Tighten bolts before each use.,
Keep the mat surface dry.,
Repair or replace damaged parts.,
Keep the area around the trampoline clear.",How to Stay Safe when Using a Trampoline3," The bolts that secure the springs of your trampoline may loosen up as the trampoline gets repeated use. If all the springs aren't held at the correct tension, your trampoline may malfunction.For example, a loose spring could lead to a ""dead spot"" on the mat. If you're jumping on the trampoline and then hit that dead spot, you won't get the same degree of bounce that you did elsewhere. The hard landing can lead to leg or ankle injuries.

, A wet trampoline surface can be very dangerous. As you jump, it will become impossible to keep your footing. A trampoline mat may take a few days to dry completely after rain.You may be able to find a cover you can use to protect your mat and keep it dry. If you're using a cover, remove it completely before using the trampoline. You still need to check to make sure the mat is dry, even if you're using a cover.

, Check your trampoline for damage before anyone uses it. You also want to check it periodically if it hasn't been used in several weeks. If you notice any damage, fix the problem as soon as possible before it gets worse.Your trampoline came with an instruction manual, which should include information on how to repair common problems. Keep a kit nearby that has the basic tools and materials you'll need to complete a repair.
You also may want to keep around trampoline mat patches, some extra bolts, and extra springs. Especially if these metal parts are exposed to the elements, you'll want to replace them if they start to show signs of rust.

, Allow there to be a buffer zone extending all the way around your trampoline. Pick up items around the yard on a regular basis, even if no one is using the trampoline at the moment.Getting in the habit of keeping the area clear will make it easier for everyone to stay safe while using the trampoline. If the buffer zone is normally kept clear, you won't forget to remove objects before jumping.

Learn archery history.,
Learn about target archery.,
Learn about field archery.,
Learn about 3D archery.,
Learn about clout archery.",How to Understand Archery," Archery bows were first developed in the late Paleolithic era, the arrows were made of pine with a long shaft ended with a sharpened flint point.


The development of firearms rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Korea, England, China, Japan, Turkey, Armenia, America, Egypt, India and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the relative neglect of archery. Early firearms were vastly inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions.
They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armor without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower by sheer weight of numbers, and highly-trained archers became almost obsolete on the battlefield.
However, archers are still effective and have seen action even in the 21st century. Traditional archery remains in use for sport, and for hunting in many areas.;
, Modern competitive target archery is often governed by the International Archery Federation, abbreviated FITA (Federation Internationale de Tir à l'Arc). Olympic rules are derived from FITA rules:


Target archery competitions may be held indoors or outdoors. Indoor distances are 18 m and 25 m. Outdoor distances range from 30 m to 90 m. Competition is divided into ends of 3 or 6 arrows. After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows.
Archers have a set time limit in which to shoot their arrows.
Targets are marked with 10 evenly spaced concentric rings, which have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them. In addition, there is an inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring. This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, it serves as a tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most X's winning. Archers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. Line breakers, an arrow just touching a scoring boundary line, will be awarded the higher score.
Different rounds and distances use different size target faces. These range from 40 cm (18 m FITA Indoor) to 122 cm (70 m and 90 m FITA, used in Olympic competition).

, Field archery involves shooting at targets of varying (and sometimes unmarked) distance, often in rough terrain.


Field rounds are at 'even' distances up to 80 yards (some of the shortest are measured in feet instead), using targets with a black bulls eye (5 points), a white center (4) ring, and black outer (3) ring. Hunter rounds use 'uneven' distances up to 70 yards (64 m), and although scoring is identical to a field round, the target has an all-black face with a white bulls eye.
Children and youth positions for these two rounds are closer, no more than 30 and 50 yards (46 m), respectively. Animal rounds use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round.
The rules and scoring are also significantly different. The archer begins at the first station of the target and shoots his first arrow. If it hits, he does not have to shoot again. If it misses, he advances to station two and shoots a second arrow, then to station three for a third if needed. Scoring areas are vital (20, 16, or 12) and non-vital (18, 14, or 10) with points awarded depending on which arrow scored first. Again, children and youth shoot from reduced range.
One goal of field archery is to improve the technique required for bowhunting in a more realistic outdoor setting, but without introducing the complication and guesswork of unknown distances. As with golf, fatigue can be an issue as the athlete walks the distance between targets across sometimes rough terrain.

, 3D archery is a subset of field archery focusing on shooting at life-size models of game and is popular with hunters. It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition.


Though the goal is hunting practice, hunting broadheads are not used, as they would tear up the foam targets too much. Normal target or field tips, of the same weight as the intended broadhead, are used instead.

, Similar to target archery, except that the archer attempts to drop arrows at long range (180 yards/165 m for the men and 140 yards/128 m for women; there are shorter distances for juniors depending on age) into a group of concentric circular scoring zones on the ground surrounding a marker flag. How to score:


Standard Target Faces which are made in different sizes are generally of five colours: gold, red, blue, black and white.
Each coloured circle is divided by a central line, this format is used by both G.N.A.S. and F.I.T.A. Depending on the type of round being shot the colours can have different scoring values.

Look for archery clubs near you.,
Call and find out what services they offer.,
Learn from a live person.,
Take an introductory course.,
Test for eye dominance.,
Rent or borrow the equipment when you first start.,
Choose a bow with the proper poundage.,
Use safety equipment.,
Choose arrows based on your draw length.,
Master the fundamentals.,
Breathe steadily when you shoot.,
Determine where you can practice.,
Practice as often as you can.,
Vary your angles and distances when you practice.",How to Start Archery," Archery is not a sport that you should try to start on your own. Search online for an archery club near you and visit it. Meet the people who work there and tell them you are brand new to archery and would like some advice about getting started.If you are in school or college, you may be able to find an archery class or club within your school. School programs are a great way to get started.
When you are researching, you may find archery organizations that meet and compete. You may also find stores/shooting ranges that sell equipment, offer lessons, and have shooting facilities.
If you can’t find a club near you, there’s most likely someone in your area who has archery experience. Ask people you know if they know anyone who would be willing to teach you the basics and possibly loan you some equipment to get started.;
, Many clubs might have meetings for beginners and more advanced shooters. You can ask if they have equipment you can test and possibly rent. A club near you might also sell equipment, which you can ask about.


Rather than showing up at the club without warning, it’s helpful if you let them know ahead of of time you are a beginner and want to learn. They may want you to bring ID of some kind, or they can tell you about any fees they may have.
Some clubs may require you to pay for a membership, and if you are unsure about how invested you want to be, you may want to look for other archery clubs.

, While you can watch videos and read about the proper techniques, nothing beats learning from an experienced archer. They can help you position yourself properly and check your form and tell you how to adjust.If you have a friend or family member who has been shooting for a while, talk to them and ask if they could give you some beginner lessons.
Archery clubs often have classes for beginners, which is the best way to learn when you have no experience.

, The benefit of this is that an intro course will be specifically designed for people with no archery knowledge. You’ll learn about common archery terms, how to stand and hold the bow, and what safety precautions to take when you shoot.


Archery has specific techniques like how your feet should be placed, how far to pull the string back, and how to aim. Taking a course will teach you these, plus give you the time to focus on them in a supportive setting.
If you find a club near you that does not offer courses, look for another one that you could take a course at, even if it’s a little farther away. Once you get the basics, you could then practice at your local club.

, Although your dominant hand may seem more important, the dominant eye will affect how you see the shot and therefore affect your aim. Performing an eye dominance test will help you figure out which side of your body to hold the bow on.Form a triangle by putting your thumbs together and forefingers together. Choose an object that’s about 15 feet away and situate it in the middle of the triangle. Close your left eye and determine if the object stays centered or shifts. Test with the right eye as well.
The eye that keeps the object centered is your dominate eye.
This is important because bows are designed specifically to be held with either the right or left hand, so it’s important to know which is best for you.

, Archery equipment is pricey and you don’t want to make that investment until you know for sure that you want to stick with it. Many archery clubs will loan or let you rent equipment.You can also find a friend or acquaintance that will let you use their equipment while you learn.
If you can’t find any rental options at clubs near you, find out what kind of return policy they have if you use the equipment for a while and decide that archery is not a good fit for you.

, Poundage, also called draw weight, is a descriptor of how much weight it takes to pull the bow string back. Your size and strength will determine the poundage that will serve you best. This is one of the things an expert at an archery club can help you with.For example, a child starting out would want a draw weight between 10-35 lbs, depending on their size. A large man would want about 65-75 lbs.
Choosing a draw weight that is too high for you will make shooting too difficult, but it can also cause injury in your arms because you’ll strain at pulling the string back.
You also don’t want it to be too easy to pull the string back, as this will cause you to over-pull the string.

, Even experienced archers often use arm guards and shooting gloves. An armguard will protect you from the snap of the string, while a shooting glove will protect your fingers from the strain of pulling the string back.Besides the safety aspects, these are also good for accuracy and smooth shots. The armguard keeps your clothes from catching on the string. The glove aids a smooth release of the string.
There is no shame in using help and taking extra precaution when you first start out. When you get comfortable, you can decide to stop using safety equipment if you want.
A chest guard is another recommended piece of safety equipment. It goes across the shoulder of the arm that holds the bow. It serves to flatten your clothing so the string doesn’t snag on them.
If you are shooting in the woods, or around other shooters, it’s important to wear bright clothing, usually orange, to make yourself highly visible to reduce shooting accidents.

, Arrows are made of wood, aluminum, carbon, and fiberglass, each with their specific benefits. The material is less important than getting the proper arrow length. Measure your arm span and divide by 2.5. Then choose arrows that are 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) longer than that.Another test is to standing perpendicular to a wall, and stick your arm out straight allow the knuckles of your closed fist to rest against the wall. Then turn toward the wall and measure from the wall to the corner of your mouth. Add 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) and this is a good length for arrows.

, Archery has a diverse range of options, from hunting to riding on horseback shooting at moving targets. Before you get into advanced shooting, you need to perfect your stance, get comfortable with gripping and drawing the bow, and become accurate at aiming. Another good skill is learning to account for wind or other weather.Once you have learned the basics, you will probably practice without a teacher most of the time, but it’s good to check back in with an instructor after you’ve been shooting a while. They can watch you shoot and make sure you are maintaining proper form.
Don’t get discouraged if you don’t start hitting bullseye right at the beginning. Archery is a discipline and it can take years to become an expert shooter.

, Holding your breath during a shot is a common mistake made by beginners. What this does is reduce oxygen to your brain and also can affect your vision. Take slow, normal breaths that keep you calm but don’t cut off your oxygen.Since archery is a calm sport, maintaining even breathing will keep you calm from start to finish of the shot.
A good practice is to exhale as you release the string, so that your breath and the arrow are in unison.

, Practicing in your own backyard, or the woods near your house, is fine as long as you know any local restrictions and practice safely. Be sure that other people are not around, or that you specifically warn them before you begin shooting.


Never shoot toward your house, or toward any area where people may be.
It may be wise to find out if any home or life insurance policy you have has stipulations about shooting.
For home practice, you can construct homemade targets from bales of hay or cardboard boxes. You can purchase targets at most sporting goods stores, hunting stores, or farm stores.

, If you want to start archery as a casual hobby that you pick up once in awhile, that’s fine, but don’t expect to improve much. Becoming a proficient archer takes consistent practice. If you can’t practice everyday, set a goal to practice a few times a week.


Especially at the beginning, your muscles may get sore from the new strain of archery, so make sure you don’t overdo it. Give yourself time to rest in between shooting sessions.
If you can practice consistently for at least the first month or so after you learn, you’ll have a better chance of getting the form down. Then your practice could slow down a little.

, It’s easy to fall into the comfortable trap of setting up a target at the same distance every time and shooting straight on. However, if you want to increase your skill, you need to shoot from longer distances and different angles.If you are going to hunt some day, get in a tree stand and shoot downward at the target, as this is likely how you’ll be hunting.
If you typically shoot at 15 feet, take shots from 20, 30, and 40 feet to increase your accuracy from longer range.
Don’t do all of your practice with a single target in an open field. Set some targets up in the woods if you can, or set up 2-3 targets and practice hitting each of them while you stand in one spot.

Adjust for the circumstances/weather.",How to Outfit Yourself for Archery," Large, dangling earrings and necklaces are very dangerous. When they get tangled with your string and you release, they can get ripped off and seriously injure you. Bracelets should be left at home too, as they can get in your way when holding the bow.

Stud earrings are okay, so are necklaces that are tucked away in your t-shirt.;
, Your string can also get caught in your hair, so make sure it doesn't get in your way., For archery, sports shoes are good, but you can wear any pair of flat, closed shoes, like sneakers. Just make sure they're comfortable.

If you are going to shoot on rough terrain, such as a forest, opt for sturdier, waterproof shoes.
Avoid sandals. When an arrow bounces back, you don't want it to land on your bare foot.

, When you're shooting in a club, you'll probably have to wear one with the logo of the club, which will probably be a good one, but any t-shirt will do, as long as the sleeves aren't too loose., Again, any pair of decent training trousers will do. Avoid jeans because as comfortable as they may be, they're not right for sports and the stiff denim can limit movement., When shooting indoors, opt for shorts/a skirt and short sleeves. When shooting outdoors and it's cold, wear training trousers with long legs and long sleeves, and a sweater when it's very cold.

If you really have to wear your club's t-shirt, wear it over some long-sleeved clothing to keep you warm. If that is not enough, you can also wear an undershirt underneath all your clothes.
When your sweater/jacket has those cords to adjust the hood, tuck them under your clothes, so the string won't get caught in them and potentially strangle you when you release.

Test your finished trampoline.",How to Set up a Trampoline," All of the materials for a trampoline will usually come in two or three packages. Empty each of the packages and make sure that you have everything that is listed in the instructions. A missing piece can prevent you from setting up the trampoline properly, so you don’t want to begin putting it together without double checking that you have everything you need.If there is a missing piece, call the company you bought the trampoline from and see what can be done about it. Sometimes they will ship you the missing piece, or they will exchange your trampoline for an entirely new one.;
, There are a lot of parts, big and small, that come with the trampoline package. The setting up process can be confusing if all of the parts are in one pile. Take some time to spread out the pieces and put them in groups according to what they are being used for.Some of the pieces may look similar, but will be used for different areas.

, You don’t need too many tools to set up a trampoline, but it is helpful to have them readily available. You will need a power drill or Phillips head screwdriver. Many packages will come with a screwdriver. You will also need a rubber mallet and spring puller, which comes with the packaging. You should also have gloves handy for when it is time to attach the springs.It’s easy to get your hands caught in the springs, so gloves prevent your skin from getting caught up in them.

, Lay out the pieces that make up the circular frame to get an idea of how big the trampoline will be. Then, begin attaching by snapping the parts together until you have a ring shape. Once assembled, the ring should be laying flat on the ground for now., Once the ring is together, begin assembling the legs. There should be spots on the ring designated for the legs. The legs should fit into the spots easily, but if not, you can use a hammer to fit them into place. You should, however, hammer lightly and use a barrier (like a towel) to soften the blow of the hammer., Now that the frame is put together, you can secure the nuts and bolts into their proper places. Make sure that all of the parts are secure and in the correct positions first, though. After you’re finished securing the screws and bolts, look over them to make sure that they are secure.Using a power drill instead a Phillips head screwdriver will make the securing process go by faster. Using a screwdriver alone can take a long time.

, Even if you’re quite strong, you will probably still need a partner for this step. Find a partner and go to opposite sides of the frame. Carefully flip the frame of the trampoline over until it is on its legs. It shouldn’t be wobbling when you turn it over.If you find that it is wobbling, inspect the set up to see which parts aren’t secure. The wobbling will probably be because of the legs. Use a screwdriver or power drill to secure the unstable parts.

, Having a partner install the springs with you makes properly aligning the mat easier. You and your partner should grab an even amount of springs—four each to start out with is okay. Go to opposite sides of the trampoline. Make sure you are exactly opposite of each other by counting the hooks., Begin attaching the springs to their designated hooks. Then, attach the hooks to the metal rings. You will need the spring pulling device to stretch the attach the springs to the hooks, and a rubber mallet to pound the springs into place once attached to the metal rings.The springs will start to get harder to attach about halfway through because of the tightening of the mat.

, The protective pad helps to cushion a fall on the springs. Simply lay the pad over the springs. There should be holes at the bottom the padding that line up with the legs. Protective pads usually have metal hooks, Velcro, or ropes to secure the pad to the trampoline. Once you are finished attaching it, make sure that it is aligned over all of the springs., Not every trampoline will come with an enclosure, but you can choose to purchase one with your trampoline. First, grab your enclosure net and bungee loops. The bungee loops should look rubber band-like. Attach the bungee loops to the net.The loops help keep the net in place when it is being bounced against.
Some regulations make it so that enclosures are required for trampolines.

, The posts for the net may come in multiple pieces. If so, connect them and then cover them with foam sleeves. Once the posts are connected, use a screwdriver or drill to secure them with screws or bolts, depending on what the package came with., Each of the bungee loops should have hooks attached to them. Attach each of the hooks to the holes on top of the posts. Then, lift the posts one by one and place them in the O-rings of the enclosure net. Once the posts are placed in the O-rings, the enclosure net just needs to be lifted to be put in place., Check everything over once more to make sure the trampoline is secure. Then, get on the trampoline and bounce a few times to make sure it is stable. If it is, your trampoline is finished and ready for activity.If the trampoline is slightly unstable, check it over for parts that may not be secured correctly. Use a screwdriver or power drill to secure those parts. Call the company you bought the trampoline from if you can’t fix the problem. Do not jump on it until the problem is fixed.

Locate the right kind of tree, depending on what's available in your local area.,
Try to ""visualize"" a potential bow resting in the tree.,
Cut down the right tree at its base and and remove the chosen section.,
Split the section, if needed.,
Seal the ends of your new bow staves.,
Let the wood season.,
Congratulations!",How to Prepare a Wood Stave for Making a Bow," It may be surprising to some, but good quality bow wood can be found around the world in a variety of climates. Depending on where you live, some varieties are:


North America- Osage Orange, Pacific Yew, Hickory, Maple, Juniper, Elm, Ash, Birch, and Locust.
South America- Ipe, Lemonwood (Degame), and Guayabi.
Europe- Yew (English, Spanish, or Italian), and Slippery or Red Elm.
Africa- Cypress, African Mahogany, and Podocarpus Latifolius.
Asia- Maple
Australia- Atlatls, instead of bows, were used on this continent.;
, For beginners, it is best to find one that is between 4"" and 12"" in diameter, is relatively free of knots, and has a straight, vertical grain.

, Its length should be 1' to 2' longer than the envisioned bow's final length.

, If the log you cut down is fairly small (less than 5""), it is not necessary to split it into staves at this point. If it is 6"" to 8"", split it down the middle into two symmetrical halves. If larger that 8"", quarter it. This is accomplished by embedding a hatchet in the middle of one end of the log. From there, use wedges, splitting mauls, or whatever else is available to carefully split the log the rest of its length.

, This keeps the wood from splitting and checking while it is seasoning, which could render it unsuitable for building a bow. This is best accomplished by smearing 2-3 coats of wood glue or thick paint on each end, and letting it dry.

, At this point the bow stave should be kept under cover and not exposed to extreme temperature or humidity changes until it is seasoned. Typical wood cures at a rate of 2"" per year, so a 4"" diameter log will take approximately a year to season, while a 12"" diameter log could take three years.

, You have yourself the very beginnings of a new bow. However, each piece of wood has character, and no matter how much care was taken in selecting the piece of wood, it may have invisible imperfections. For this reason, it is best to process several staves at once; then if one breaks while making a bow, you will have another one to begin on.

To Land a front tuck, first practice a tuck jump.,
Understand that you must not travel across the trampoline bed.,
Starting on your hands and knees, bounce a little then tuck VERY TIGHT and VERY FAST, lifting your bottom upwards and BACKWARDS, landing on your back or bottom.,
Now practice small jumps, up TUCK and over to your back landing your back exactly where your feet were when you took off.,
Jump with your hands staying in the air above your head.,
Remember to tuck first, sending your bottom up and backwards just like you did with the hand and knees practice.

,
If you are landing on your bottom, you are not tucking hard enough, fast enough or long enough.,
If you are landing and falling forward, you are over rotating and you need to slow it down a little.

,
If you just can't get it... go back to the hands and knees practice until you can learn to get around to your feet/bottom.

,
Remember to somersault over right at the top of the jump, and not to throw your head down.",How to Land a Front Flip on the Trampoline," You must have lots of height at the top of the jump, bring your knees up to your chest nice and tight then pop them back out to land your flip and you will be amazed with your accomplishment!;
, Therefore, you will be taking off in the very middle of the trampoline and landing in the middle too.

, Have you moved across the trampoline? If you have, try again. Up and BACKWARDS. Lift your bum over your head. If you can easily land on your bottom in the middle of the trampoline, go back to your feet.

, If you are not traveling across the bed... you are ready to try landing on two feet.

, Jump just 3 or four times, then TUCK very tight and very fast bring your arms down for the tuck. The idea is getting your knees up to your chest, NOT throwing your upper body down.

,, Tuck tight, real fast and hold on to the tuck a little longer.

,,, Your bum goes BEFORE your head. That is, jump high and then push off with your back legs and put your knees to your chest and then when you're close to landing pop them out.

Land safely.",How to Flip on the Trampoline," Using a trampoline can be very dangerous, so it is best to train first in a safe environment. Training happens in lessons for competitive sports including gymnastics and diving. There, a teacher or coach can help you learn how to use a trampoline properly.Improper use of a trampoline can lead to severe head and spinal injuries. Flipping increases your chances of this.
Flips should not be attempted until you feel completely comfortable using a trampoline.;
, The ideal area to place your trampoline is a level surface away from any obstacles, including trees, fences, and lawn equipment. Place the trampoline on absorbent ground such as a grassy lawn, wood chips, or sand. Add padded mats for extra protection.Proper cushioning shields you when you fall. The motion and momentum from flipping makes bone fractures more likely.

, Safety padding is brightly-colored shielding that goes around the edges of the trampoline, covering the frame and springs. Order padding online or choose a trampoline that has the thickest padding possible. The frame is a hard surface and can also cause fractures if you land on it., Never get on the trampoline until you have ordered a net and placed it securely around the trampoline. When you fall, the net will slow your momentum or catch you before you hit the ground. This is important in flipping because of all the movement you’ll be doing., Bigger trampolines have enough space for more than one person, but this isn’t safe. Besides the difficulty in controlling your motion when multiple people jump, the other person can easily bump into you and send you flying. The lighter person on the trampoline is more likely to get hurt.

, Jumping off while flipping creates a heavy impact that can damage your knees and break your ankles, but this applies to regular jumping too. Instead, stay in place until you come to a halt. Walk to the edge of the trampoline and step or slide off., Backflips seem scarier but are easier to perform than front flips. After warming up and getting a feel for the trampoline by bouncing, begin to bounce in one spot. Stand straight with your hands against your side. On your highest bounce, prepare to flip.


It may be helpful to choose a number between four and eight. Count your bounces. On the number you chose, make that bounce your highest and start the flip.

, In order to complete the flip, you’ll need to create the proper trajectory. Lean slightly back when you rise on your last trampoline bounce. Your back, shoulders, neck, and head should point slightly behind the straight position you had when bouncing.If you lean back too far, you won’t have enough momentum. If you lean forward, you will have a harder time flipping.

, Right when you reach the pinnacle of your bounce, shoot your arms up hard over your head, slightly bent like you’re going to throw a ball backwards. Straighten them quickly before you start tumbling. It’s important to do this with force to help start your rotation., As you begin to fall backwards, bring your legs into your chest. At the same time, bring your arms down. Reach for your knees and pull hard. Also tighten your abs to help pull you through your rotation., Once your sight goes past the trampoline to the area beyond, it’s time to prepare for landing. Position yourself by uncurling your legs. Bring your arms out to help you maintain your balance.

, Before your feet hit the ground, bend your legs slightly. Never lock your legs while bending or else the impact will damage your knees. Try to land on the balls of your feet first before your heels hit the ground.


In case you begin to fall, don’t brace yourself with your hands. This may cause wrist damage.

, After you feel warmed up, bounce in a single spot. Keep your back straight. Bounce a few times to build momentum, then bounce as high as possible before beginning your flip.

, Pick a notable spot ahead of you, such as a spot on the wall or a ball someone left out. Your head should be held straight. Watch this object as long as you can while beginning the flip. It will help you monitor what position your body is in during the flip.Remember this spot so that you can find it again and use it to initiate your landing.

, Incline yourself slightly forward during your last bounce. Your head and back will be angled slightly ahead of a neutral standing position. Like during a backflip, this ensures that you get enough of a trajectory to complete your flip.

, At the peak of your bounce, shoot your arms up to generate force. Keep them bent a little like you’re throwing a ball over your head. Quickly straighten your arms when the flip begins. Hold your body straight as you begin to tumble forward.

, Bring your knees up towards your chest. Move your arms downward, trying to reach for your calves instead of your knees. The tighter you can make yourself, the faster you’ll rotate., When you see the spot you had chosen before, begin to uncurl your body. Bring your arms straight out to help you balance. Return your head to its usual position, straight and looking forward., Bend your legs before you land to avoid causing damage to your knees. Aim to land on the balls of your feet first. When your feet first hit the ground, bring down your heels to stabilize yourself.

, Side flips work the same way as other flips, except the motion feels more awkward. Start out as normal, standing straight while bouncing in place on the trampoline. During your highest bounce, prepare to start your flip.

, At the top of your bounce, pull your head and shoulders to the side as hard as you can. This creates momentum towards whatever way you chose.Your arms aren’t used for momentum in this flip, so it isn’t necessary to raise them.

, In the opposite direction of your head and shoulders, push your hips. You may be tempted to push your body backwards, but keep it straight as you move your hips to the side. This movement gives you a little extra rotation in your lower body to help you complete the flip.

, Like you do in any flip, bring your legs up into your chest. Bring your arms down to your knees or calves to help you rotate. Tighten yourself into a ball as much as possible to complete the flip., At the end of the flip, bring your legs back out. Keep your legs slightly bent as your feet hit the trampoline. Bring your arms straight out if you need them to balance.

, Bend your legs a little before hitting the ground. Try to land on the balls of your feet first. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart if possible. This gives you the most stability when landing.

Learn the knee drop and doggy drop.,
Learn front drops and back drops.,
Learn an array of moves such as the cradle.,
Learn the cody.,
Learn the barani.,
Learn front hand spring.,
Be aware that these are all tricks which require a clever skill of knowing 'when' to twist.",How to Do Trampoline Tricks," It is the tuck jump. You need to be able to tuck up fast enough to get the rotation needed for other jump styles. To do it, bring your knees to your chest and grab your knees with your hands.;
, These are important for getting balance and pre-determining later moves. When you straddle jump, keep your legs in a position similar to the splits except in a shape like a mountain or a triangle without a bottom. You go right in between your straddle in fists, with your arms and hands stretched as far as you can go.


The pike is similar to a straddle, except that your body forming an 'L' with your legs up horizontally. This trick also consists of placing your arms out in front of you, in fists.

, These may sound boring, but you need to know how to do them as ""late twists"" and not using your arms and twisting from the bed.


A full turn is as easy as it sounds, you spin in the air. You can also try doing double turns.

, This drop doesn't need much ""air"" or balance, it consists of about one to three bounces, then you simply drop into a sitting position with your toes pointed in front of you and your back straight. Half twist to seat drop; seat drop half twist out; and swivel hips. This helps with learning to get your hips up and how to twist in and out of moves.

, The knee drop is just what it sounds like, jumping and dropping on your knees. This drop consists of about one to three drops. This drop is easy and is a good drop to do for going into back drops (below) and front flips. A doggy drop is the same as a front drop but involves putting your hands in front of your knees., Then learn how to twist into them and how to twist out of them. These fundamental moves will teach you about 'forward' movement and 'backward' moves. Believe it or not... the front drop is ""Backward movement and the backdrop is a forward movement. Understanding this is important if your want to do forward or backward flips.


The backdrop has a scary feeling to it and needs some courage. When you're doing a backdrop, tuck your chin into your neck tightly and land in the middle of your back (this prevents whiplash). You, also, should point your arms and legs up to sky to help you bounce back up.
Front drops (or stomach drops) are super fun once you get the hang of it. When you're starting this trick, it's easier to do it from a knee drop. This trick is simply dropping to your stomach, and when you are doing this, try to prevent dropping with your hands out to the side. Also try keeping your hands in a broken in half triangle form right beside your chin to protect your face and neck.

, This is a backdrop half twist to backdrop, the seat roll seat (roller), the airplane (full twist to front drop) and the full twist to backdrop.

, This is a back flip in to a front drop and lift straight into a back somersault.

, This is a front somersault with a half twist - with the key twisting late - just like the roller!

, It's a front flip only you put your hands down and you arch you back on the way to you feet. Remember to arch your back. If you don't, you'll end up doing a somersault.

, By way of a hint, it's late twisting and twist from the hips and pull your arms the direction you want to twist). Of course, once you have learned all the fundamentals, you can start learning clever trampoline tricks including the Front flip which is a combination of the tuck jump and backward motion of a front drop. Or the Back flip which is a combination of the Seat drop (hips forward) - in to a backdrop (hips up), utilizing the tuck jump!

Now tighten all of the ropes to achieve the desired tension on the trampoline.,
Trim the excess rope and melt the end with a lighter (be careful not to melt the trampoline!),Time to go sailing!",How to Install a Prindle 18 Trampoline,", Insert the untied end up through the hull lacing slot at the front of the boat, through the first webbing loop, and back down into the same lacing slot. Repeat this lacing towards the back of the boat on both sides. Leave the ropes untied and semi loose for now.

, Lace both sides inwards until they meet in the center and both pass through the same grommet. Next continue lacing each line one more loop. The two lines should now both end under the trampoline on the same side with a grommet in between them., The side lacing should finish with a barrel knot under the lip of the hull (as it started). For the aft lacing; tie a bowline knot in one rope, pass the second aft rope through the bowline knot, and tie three half hitches., We suggest leaving approximately five inches of rope at the end of the knots for later adjustments.,"

Keep your eyes open!",How to Front Somersault on a Trampoline,";
, When you're ready, bounce off your hands and knees, tuck tight and fast and push your hips BACK and UP. You should rotate to land on your back or in a seat drop position.

, They'll bounce with you in time and you'll try front somersault from standing. The other person is there to push you round if you under rotate, to ensure you don't land incorrectly(causing painful injuries .

, Start the somersault at the peak of your bounce(your arms should be high above your head), bring the arms down as you tuck your knees to your chest, hold your knees if you want. Push your hips hard backwards and upwards and tuck your head in, trying to power your rotation. Make sure that the other person throws in a crash mat if it seems you will land badly.

, When you think you are around 2/3 of the way round and you see the distant sky(or if you're inside, a point above head height that you've already decided on), open up straight and you should land on your feet. Once you can do the somersault unaided several times, the person should not need to throw the mat in any longer.

Complete consecutive swivel hips.,
Show your friends and family.",How to Do Swivel Hips on a Trampoline," Avoid the sides of the trampoline as they may not give you enough bounce to complete a swivel hip. Give it 1-3 good bounces. Try to get as much time in the air as possible. The higher the bounce, the more time you have to complete a swivel hip.









Bend at the knees as you land. As you jump up vertically from the trampoline, rebound from the trampoline by pushing from the trampoline with your feet.Use both arms to make a scooping motion near the trampoline. Your arms should be naturally swinging, not clenched or at your sides. Bring your arms quickly up into the air, stretching to reach the sky. This will allow your body to stretch naturally and gain more air time to bounce higher.;
, A seat drop is a move where you land in a sitting position while your toes are pointed in front of you. Your back should be straight and not hunched over. A seat drop is essentially jumping high in the air, then landing in a sitting position on the trampoline.









Your hands should be sitting on the trampoline as you land, pointing into the direction of your legs. They should be parallel to your thighs to aid in balancing your seat drop., Practice a seat drop and landing on your feet until you feel comfortable doing it. Make sure that your hands are high up in the air as you land on your feet in the middle of the trampoline.









Your arms should be moving naturally in a swinging motion to help you in achieving more time in the air.

, As you are about to land on your feet from a seat drop, twist your body so that you're facing the opposite direction. Swing your hips and your arms will naturally following into the direction of the twist. Land on your feet in the said opposite direction. Note that it is important that the arms go up high and fast.









Do not twist straight from seat position, as you will not move properly. Wait until you nearly land on your feet, then twist quickly.

, Ensure that your arms are located high above your head. Remember, bring your arms up as quickly as possible. Keep trying!








, After your seat drop half twist out, swing your hips forward into the opposite direction, and land on your bottom for another seat drop. Again, your hands should be near your thighs, touching the trampoline and pointing into the direction of your toes. Now you have completed one set of swivel hips. Keep practicing until it becomes a natural, fluid motion.








, See if you can put a few together in a row. Once you get the hang of it, your hips will begin to look like you're swiveling on the trampoline.








, After you've mastered swivel hips on the trampoline, invite your friends over and show them your new move! See if you can beat the world record and perform 44 consecutive swivel hips.

Allow your experience with front flips to act as a guide.,
Land on your knees.,
Perform the knee flip.",How to Do a Knee Flip on a Trampoline1," Before you jump, warm up by doing some stretches. Then start to bounce on the trampoline as you do when you attempt front flips.Gain as much air as you can as you bounce on top of the trampoline.
Repeat your jumps at least a handful of times to ensure you’re getting the most air possible for your flip.;
, With a front flip, the emphasis is placed on practicing motioning into a handstand. With a knee flip, the emphasis is placed on motioning into a position on your knees. Practice bouncing a handful of times and then dropping to your knees to land., Use force to lean and push your body forward. Start to flip in between your peak and right after you start bouncing.It is okay if you land on your bottom when you first start attempting this flip. You have to speed up how quickly you spin in order to land on your feet.
Don't wait until you are at your peak of your bounce to start flipping. Start flipping as soon as your knees hit the trampoline.

Deepen the stretch even more by touching your ankle(s) and pull them in an upward motion to stretch your hamstrings.

, Bring your knees to your chest midair while you jump. Practice stopping the tuck jump by landing on the trampoline in a pike position., Allow yourself to fall over onto your bottom or your back as you come out of them. Practice the handstand and falling over quicker every time. Try jumping in the air and doing the handstand as a seamless motion., This should be attempted after you have jumped in the air several times and practiced the handstand successfully. Be as fast as possible to make sure you have a good start to your flip.When you are doing the handstand motion, remember to keep your hands down so you aren’t using them during the flip.
When you’re ready to land on the trampoline, jump high into the air and just land on your feet.

, Bounce up and down, but not too high. Use the trampoline to propel you and turn the normal movement of the flip.Focus on how you are going to land on the trampoline.

Obviously, the first step is to register for an autocross event.,
Once you arrive at the track, you must register your car as present.,
Once your car has been registered and teched, and you have been assigned a number, it is time to check out the course.,
Once you feel you have a grasp of the course layout, apply what knowledge you have of your cars handling characteristics.,
Using all that information, develop a plan on how you will attack the course.,
After your first run, if everything went well, try to get faster and faster, by making your turns smoother and smoother.",How to Autocross," You can usually do this by contacting a local car club or racetrack and asking for information. Registration fees are often small, usually around fifty dollars.;
, At the same time, you must get your car ""teched"". This only means it must be examined by the an attending technician. This is an overall, visual inspection, and it checks for basic integrity of vehicle parts. As long as your vehicle is generally well maintained and there is no significant structural issues, this inspection should not be a problem.

, There is no set layout for an autocross course, however, they are often tight and very curvy, to downplay the advantages of horsepower and speed and emphasize the advantages of experienced technical driving. Walk the course over and over. The best autocrossers learn the course so well, they actually memorize the whole course and every turn.

, For example, if you drive a powerful, front engine rear wheel drive (FR) car, the car may have a natural tendency to oversteer. Controlled oversteer can help you set faster times, but it can also be very difficult to control. If you drive a front wheel drive front engine (FF) car, it probably exhibits the natural tendency to understeer. While safer, and less scary, than oversteer, understeer can often slow your times rough curves. If you drive an all wheel drive car, these effects can be mixed and more neutral. There are other layouts, such as rear engine rear wheel drive (RR) and mid-engine rear wheel drive, which also have their own unique handling characteristics.

, Keeping that in mind, almost every autocross event allows you to run multiple times. Line up as directed, and complete your first run slowly. You should always run slowly on your first lap. This is to allow your cars tires and brakes to warm, and because the course feels different from behind the wheel.

, Enjoy.

Get two spotters.,
The spotters will place their hands on your shoulder and hamstring from either side.

,
Jump up and do a very tight tuck jump.

,
Allow the spotters to spin you.,
Jump up as high as you can go.

,
Keep your eyes open the whole way around.,
Push your hips forward really hard and without leaning back at all at the peak of your bounce(the highest point).,
Trust the spotters to decide weather or not you will make it round.,
Concentrate on getting round for the first few tries.,
If you continuously land with one spotter without traveling backwards or gaining forwards he will then step on to the side of the trampoline and you will do it on your own with one spotter pushing the mat in on three and the other coming onto the bed from the side either catching you are clearing your head.

,
After you have landed about ten times in a row on your feet, the spotter will jump down and now there will only be a mat coming in.,
After you are really comfortable the next step is called the kick out.,
At first, try to kick out at about 150 degrees and gradually increase you kick out to 180.

,
When this is perfected you have a tucked back somersault.

",How to Do a Tucked Back Somersault on a Trampoline," This will enable you to rotate 360 degrees without any damage inflicted.;
,,, Practise this until you are all comfortable with the move.

,, Back somersaults any shape are easier the front somersaults because a front somersault is a blind landing.

, This will make the body rotate backwards depending on how hard you push and how tight you tuck you will spin faster or slower.

, If they think you will they will push the hamstring. If they think you will not then they will push the Shoulder, keeping you upright. If they think you pushed too hard they will grip tight to your hands and this will prevent you landing on your face.

, The spotters will help you do that.

,, After another 10 the spotter will ask you if you feel comfortable doing them on your own. If you reply yes he will have the mat ready and if it looks like it is going wrong he will push it in otherwise he will keep it out.

, A good tucked back somersault will go up push hips forward tuck and then kick out of the tuck when the head is parallel to the floor(1/2 way through the tucked back somersault). You will need to spin faster meaning you will need to push harder and tuck tighter. A kick-out will slow your spin down hence the reason you need to push harder at the beginning.

Get a sandboard.,
Choose sand dunes or sand hills that are open for recreation.,
Try almost flat terrain and skating exercises if you're a beginner.,
Practice on a small sand hill with very little drop.,
On the small hill, try the following drill to improve your ability to board on your heels:


Strap both feet in.,
Repeat the above exercise, but this time working your toes, rather than your heels:


After you have strapped yourself in, turn yourself around and put pressure on your toes, to stabilize yourself at the top of the hill.,
Continue going down the hill, each time increasing your skill in different areas.,
Practice the above steps till you are comfortable with your skills.,
Learn sandboarding tricks.,
Join a club or association that promotes sandboarding.",How to Sandboard," A sandboard is similar to a snowboard. It has a specially waxed base and has bindings attached to it which attach to your feet so that you can't lose it as you sand board down the hill. The sandboards come in a variety of designs (twin tips, square tails, and swallow tails) and waxes aimed at increasing speed, so it's a good idea to discuss the options with the retailer. You will also need to decide between a terrain board (cheaper, perfect for shorter, less steep runs) and a full-size board (more expensive, for larger dunes and greater speeds).Whatever board you choose, it should come up to about your mouth in height. The sorts of places that might sell a sandboard include surfboard and snowboard retailers, and outdoor recreation outfitters; perhaps call them before visiting to check they have stock. It is also possible to make your own sandboard using instructions found online; just search for ""sandboard instructions"".It's a good idea to get a helmet for safety, and some knee and elbow pads for buffeting when you fall, although this is personal preference; if you do fall, sand is pretty soft and forgiving although speed can make a difference as to how you land and it's always possible to break something or get a concussion.
Get some wax. This will need to be reapplied according to the instructions provided with your board and/or the relevant wax product.
In terms of clothing, shorts and a t-shirt are perfect!You could also use a normal snowboard if you have one; however, be aware that purpose-built sandboards come with different wax styles matched to different sand types and climate for best performance. You can certainly swap the straps and boots between both sports.
Consider hiring a sandboard before purchasing one. That way, if you don't like it, you haven't outlaid too much money.;
, There are plenty of places with sand dunes, probably even in a landlocked country because sand is plentiful. Look for dunes near beaches, rivers, and in arid zones such as deserts. Also check that the sport is authorized for the dunes you're using, as some dunes are protected by law to prevent erosion or scaring off species nesting or feeding in the dunes. Find out about the state of protection before using the sand dunes; you can ask at local ranger stations or government land/environment offices.


Don't use dunes or hills with dune grass growing on them because the boarding will damage their fragile roots. Choose only hills or dunes that have just sand.Most sandboarding locations are currently free, apart from a few specific parks set up for sandboarding. This is part of the attraction of sandboarding for many – low start-up costs, and a lot of free places often not filled with people.

, If you're already experienced with snowboarding or skateboarding, proceed to the next step. For the beginner, try the following suggestions to help you ""get a feel"" for the board on the sand and a sense of balance.


Spend some time ""skating"". Simply strap in only one foot, and use the other foot to propel you and the board around the sand. Try this on flat terrain and on very small sand humps.
Now, strap both feet in. Have someone push you slowly along the almost flat terrain first off. This will help you get a ""feel"" for the sand.
In general, as a total beginner it should take about one day of practicing with a sandboard before you start to feel confident enough to stay on your feet, ride, and make a few turns., If you've already snowboarded or skateboarded, you'll probably already find the balancing easy enough and the feel won't be so strange for you as it will be for a beginner.(Nevertheless, even if you're a beginner, don't fret, as you'll soon pick up the technique.) Find a small sand dune or sand hill and make sure it's not too steep, as you'll likely have to spend some time just getting used to the maneuvering the sandboard before you can cope with steeper gradients and drops.


The best type of dune is one covered with dry sand. Wet sand will stick to the board, either causing it to stop or to slow down considerably, which defeats the purpose of going down fast!
If at any point you feel yourself getting into trouble, try sitting down.,
Go down the hill on your heels. You do this by pulling up on your toes. Don’t pull up to much or you're going to fall on your butt.
Now let up on your heels so you can go down the hill. If you pick up too much speed or want to stop pull up on your toes again.
At the bottom of the hill, unstrap one of your straps. Preferably the one that you strapped up at the top of the hill. Now make your way back up to the top of the hill.

, Remember not too much pressure, or you will fall. Let the pressure off your toes to start going down the hill. If you start going too fast, put pressure on your toes to slow down or stop.

, For example, start pushing towards more aggressive turns and stances:


Go back to the top of the hill. You're going to go down again on your heels. Put pressure on your right foot so you can weave to the right of the hill. Then put pressure on your left foot so you can weave to the left of the hill. Continue doing this until you reach the bottom.
Try the above again, but on your toes instead of your heels.
Repeat the above drills, but put more pressure on your right foot so your board is facing straight down the hill. Then start to put pressure on your toes. Now you should be on your toes going to the left part of the hill.
If you want to get back to your heels, put pressure on your front foot until your board is facing straight down the hill. Now put pressure on your heels.

, Then move up to a large or steeper sand hill. Master steeper hills gradually until you feel completely comfortable with what you're doing. And don't forget to have fun!

, As you improve with your balance, gradient, and general sense of control with the sandboard, start learning to do sandboard tricks. There are a number of different tricks possible, and some of these can end up getting you into competition level at such events as the Rail Jam. You can do many of the tricks you'd do on a snowboard with the sand board, such as 360s, 720s, back flips, rodeos, and switch blind 180s, once you're good enough with the board and get the speed right., If one doesn't exist in your local area, consider starting one up to attract like-minded people to share your fun times with. From here, you can also consider entering competitions including the Sandboarding World Championship, the Pan-American Sandboarding Challenge, and the Sand Sports Super Show.


Yearly sandboarding championships are held in Oregon, California, and Nevada, with most being held between June and September, although some competitions are held during winter in warmer states such as Nevada. Competitions include drag races and slalom events.
Internationally, countries like Australia and Chile hold sandboarding competitions each year.

Start by doing handstands on your trampoline.,
Now keep doing handstands and falling over, but do them faster.,
Once you are able to do that very well, try doing it by jumping in the air 3-8 times then doing a handstand.,
Try doing that (number 3) without your hands :).,
Now we need to work on you landing it.,
Now do a front flip.,
Now if you can land on your feet but have to use your hands, then here is when you change that.,
If you can land on your feet and not fall back, then now we work on making it look nicer.,
Now you can do a beautiful front flip!

",How to Do a Front Flip on the Trampoline," When doing the handstand fall over onto your back or bottom. Keep doing this for about 2 days.;
, That means go on your hands then fall over as quickly (and safely) as possible. Do this for about 1-2 weeks.

, Be careful when doing this! Do this for about 1 week.

, Make sure you go fast. And make sure your head is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) off the ground. If not, jump higher! And jump a few times before you flip. Just jump and pretend you are doing a handstand but forgot to put your hands down. Keep your arms by your side or straight out for balance. If you do not feel comfortable, then wait a few more days. You will land on your back or bottom.

, This is a little trickier. What you need to do is jump in the air ( don't flip forward yet) and then land on your feet but have your bottom about 2 feet (0.6 m) off the ground. Keep doing this for a week.

, When you go to land , try keeping your legs bent and feet flat. You may land on your bottom, or you may land on your feet but then slip and fall onto your bottom. Do this for 3-5 weeks.This takes about 2 -4 months to master.

, When you land, lean forward a tiny bit. You will land on your feet and will be leaning forward so that will make you not fall backwards.

, Try keeping your legs straight while flipping then bending them a little when you land . Don't keep your legs locked! This can cause a serious injury.

Start with the proper grip.,
Try the pinch grip.,
Test the cradle grip.",How to Throw a Boomerang1," You can hold the boomerang on either arm -- the lift (leading) arm or the dingle (trailing) arm. Either way, make sure that the painted, curved side is always facing toward you and the flat side is facing away from you., The pinch grip involves ""pinching"" the boomerang between your thumb and index finger. You throw the boomerang by flicking your wrist backwards before snapping it forwards. This creates enough momentum to pull the boomerang out of your hand and create spin., This grip is similar to the pinch grip, except you wrap your index finger (or all four fingers) around the edge of the boomerang instead. Grip the boomerang as close to the bottom of the arm as possible, and as you throw, flick the boomerang with your index finger as if pulling a trigger. This helps to create spin."
"
Find a large, open area.,
Watch out for weather conditions.,
Throw the boomerang around the wind.",How to Throw a Boomerang2," Choose an area where you have at least 50 meters (164.0 ft) of space on all sides. Football fields, soccer pitches, and open park spaces are all good options. Make sure there are not too many trees or bushes for your boomerang to get caught in, or large bodies of water for it to fall into.Avoid practicing your boomerang throw in crowded areas, or places with a lot of windows or parked cars. It can be difficult to predict where your boomerang will land, and a mis-thrown boomerang can cause significant injury or damage to property.You should always throw from the center of an open space. This will help you to throw more consistently, while also providing some leeway on all sides if the flight of the boomerang doesn't go as planned., Wind is one of the most important factors in the proper return of a boomerang. Ideally, you want a nice calm day, with winds between 0 to 10 mph (16 km/h). Some boomerangs will not return in completely calm weather, but most will. Avoid throwing your boomerang in high winds, as it will distort the path of the boomerang and throw it off course.Light rain will not distort the flight of the boomerang. If you choose to use your boomerang on rainy days, put a protective seal on it, especially if it's made from wood, to prevent it from swelling with moisture.Even though falling snow will not affect the flight of the boomerang, snow on the ground will conceal a fallen boomerang, making it almost impossible to find., You want to throw the boomerang ""around"" the wind, meaning that you throw it to the right of an oncoming wind, and it returns on the left (or the opposite if you're left-handed). You want to throw your boomerang between 45 to 90 degrees to the right or left of an oncoming wind.To figure out wind direction, pick up a fistful of grass or leave and throw them into the air. If the leaves blow across your face to the right, you will need to turn left, and vice versa.Stand so that the wind is blowing directly into your face, then turn about 45 degrees to the left or right, depending on which is your dominant hand.Some boomerangs work better when thrown at a wider angle to the wind (up to 90 degrees) so experiment a little to find out which angle works best for you."
"
Throw the boomerang vertically, with the correct layover.,
Throw the boomerang at the appropriate elevation.,
Figure out the footwork.,
Give it some spin.,
Focus on technique, not strength.,
Catch the boomerang.",How to Throw a Boomerang3," Boomerangs should be thrown vertically overhand, as if throwing a baseball, so they will cartwheel end-over-end. Hold the boomerang so that it's almost perpendicular with the ground, tilting it 5 to 20 degrees to the right (if you're right-handed) or to the left (if you're left-handed).The degree to which you tilt the boomerang is called the layover. If using a wide layover, you should throw the boomerang softly, whereas more vertical layovers will require harder throws.Throwing a boomerang horizontally will prevent the boomerang from returning. It will cause the boomerang to climb high into the air, before dropping straight back to the ground and potentially breaking., Most boomerangs only need to be thrown at eye-level, with an elevation about 10 degrees above the ground. A good trick is to pick a point slightly above the horizon, such as some far-away tree top, and aim directly for it., A right-handed thrower will need to pivot their right foot outwards, lift their left leg so all the weight is on the right, then step forwards onto the left foot as they throw, in a move that's known as ""casting the foot out."" Left-handed people will do the exact opposite. This helps to put more weight behind the throw, increasing the distance the boomerang will travel., Spinning the boomerang as you throw is perhaps the most important deciding factor in whether your boomerang returns to you or not. You can give your boomerang spin by cocking your wrist backwards, then snapping it forwards as you throw. You shouldn't just release the boomerang -- it should be ripped from your grip by the force of the spin., Unless you're really focused on distance, the strength of your throw is not the most important thing when it comes to throwing a boomerang. Once you have the hang of putting a good spin on your throw, you can start to focus on power., The best way to catch a returning boomerang is to extend both arms, wait until the boomerang reaches below shoulder level, then clap your hands together to catch the boomerang between your palms (known as the sandwich catch). If you've lost sight of your boomerang, or it's coming at you too fast, turn around, hunker to the ground, and cover your head with hands.There are lots of trick catches you can try, such as the under-the-leg catch, the hand-to-foot catch and behind-the-back catch. You may want to wear some padded fingerless gloves to protect your hands while attempting these trick catches."
"
Purchase a high quality boomerang.,
Beginners should choose a v-shaped or a tri-bladed boomerang.,
Choose a heavier boomerang if you are advanced.,
Pick a boomerang made for your dominant hand.",How to Throw a Boomerang4," The type of boomerang you buy will have a significant impact on whether you will get it to come back to you or not. Boomerangs are made from regular pieces of wood or plastic, so it takes some skilled workmanship to imbue such everyday materials with the aerodynamic qualities that make boomerangs so unique.


There are loads of boomerangs on the market, but not all of them are true returning boomerangs, so do your research before you buy.

, Pick one that is made from lightweight materials. These boomerangs do not require a strong throw, which allows beginners to focus more on technique. They will usually travel between 10 to 25 meters (32.8 to 82.0 ft) before returning., Once you have mastered the throwing technique and your boomerang is consistently returning, you can move on to intermediate and, later, advanced boomerangs. These boomerangs tend to be heavier, come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can travel distances of up to 50 meters (164.0 ft) before returning., Be aware that you will need either a left-handed or right-handed boomerang depending on your dominant hand. If you're left-handed, you will have considerable difficulty in throwing a right-handed boomerang with any success."
"
Reassess your throw if your boomerang won't come back.,
Change your direction if your boomerang returns to the wrong spot.,
Watch your boomerang closely if you keep losing sight of it.,
Repair your boomerang if it becomes warped or nicked.",How to Throw a Boomerang5," If your boomerang is failing to return to you, the reason is one of two things: your boomerang is of poor quality, or your throw is incorrect. If you think your throw is incorrect, focus on correcting the following common mistakes:Decrease the layover of your throw. If your throw is too horizontal, it will almost certainly fail to come back. Throw your boomerang almost vertically for best results.
Don't throw the boomerang across your body. Instead, throw it straight ahead. If your throwing hand ends up across from the opposite shoulder, you know you're doing it incorrectly.
Work on your spin. Focus on flicking your wrist, as this is where most of the spin comes from. You can also experiment with different grips and hand positioning to find out which is most comfortable and effective for you.

, If the boomerang comes back but lands too far in front of you or too far behind you to catch, you are probably facing the wrong direction in relation to the wind.If the boomerang lands in front of you, try turning a few degrees to the left, so you are throwing more directly into the wind.
If the boomerang lands behind you, try turning a few degrees to the right, so you are throwing further away from the wind.
These directions will be reversed if you are left-handed.

, The flight of a boomerang is almost impossible to predict, so if you look away for even a second, you may not be able to find it again. If you've thrown it well, the boomerang may fly back suddenly and hit you in the face. But if you've thrown it badly, you may never be able to find it again.Wear sunglasses while practicing in case your boomerang flies into the path of the sun. They will also protect your eyes should your boomerang come back and hit you in the face.
If the boomerang falls out of the sky as the result of a bad throw, make a mental note of a landmark you can use to locate it. Search for it right away, as you may not be able to find it later.

, Boomerangs can easily become warped or dented due to repeated crash landings or fumbled catches. However, with a little love and care most of these problems can be patched up and your boomerang will still be in perfect working order.To fix a warped boomerang: Place the boomerang in the microwave or hold it over the heat on an electric stove for 8-10 seconds. Bend the boomerang in the opposite direction to the warp and hold it in place until the wood cools again.To fix nicks and scratches: Fill any holes with a little wood putty. Once the putty dries, sand the boomerang until smooth, then cover with a coat of polyurethane seal to keep moisture out."

Buy or borrow a heavy-duty, appropriately sized board bag.,
Remove the fins from your board.,
Remove the old wax off your board.,
Cut foam pipe insulation covering and duct tape it down the rails of your board.,
Protect the ding prone areas of your board such as the nose and tail.,
Slide the board into a sock or bubble wrap bag if you have one.,
Place the protected board in your board bag.,
Write ""top load"" or ""fragile"" on the bag with a marker or acrylic paint.",How to Pack a Surfboard for Travel," To increase the odds of ding-free travel, buy a board bag. While some people claim you can travel safely without a board bag, it's debatable and is certainly a moot point when you receive a damaged board at the other end of your flight. Prevention is better than cure:


Purchase a bag that is six inches / 15 centimeter (5.9 in) longer than your longest board; this additional length leaves room for cushioning.
Consider how many boards you'll be traveling with on this trip and in the future. Obtain a bag that will accommodate your needs. Board bags are available with compartments that enable you to carry more than one board safely.
Think about what kind of bag would be most convenient to travel with. For example, you may wish to get a bag with wheels so that it's easier to bring with you through long airport queues and getting and from your accommodations.
A plastic hardcover board bag will be most effective at protecting your board, but also the most heavy and bulky luggage to travel with.;
, If you have removable travel fins such as FCS, O'Fish, or Excel Fins, it makes good sense to remove them to prevent the possibility of catching on surrounding objects. A flatter object travels more soundly.


Wrap the removed fins in a towel and keep them with your board, along with the fin key. If you forget the fin key, your efforts are in vain, so double check it is in there before zipping up.
If you have standard fins, place a fin box around the fins to protect them. Fin boxes are not expensive, but if necessary, you can make your own by using polystyrene blocks - ask for these at electrical stores and warehouses.

, Skipping this step will usually cause your cold water surf wax to melt all over your board bag when you land in the tropics.

, Pipe covering is available at most hardware stores.


Cut a slit down one side of the pipe insulation.
Secure the insulation to the railings with duct tape or shrink wrap.

, Do this by duct taping items that you're already traveling with, such as wet-suits, towels, and clothes around the board. Bubble wrap is also a great choice as it is lightweight and cushions impacts well. Look for bubble wrap with the larger bubbles.


If you're using pipe insulation for the rails, you can use it to reinforce the nose and tail as well. Secure with duct tape or shrink wrap.
Cut a ""bend relief"" notch at the center of the nose and tail so that the insulation doesn't bunch up.
You can also run insulation along the center of the board for additional protection.

, This is yet another layer of protection that will go inside the full board bag.

, Throw in some extra clothes and padding for that extra bit of protection, especially at the ends or any ding-prone parts. Don't forget the removable fins and the fin key, if applicable.


If you're packing more than one board, there are a few different ways you can arrange them:
If the fins are removed, place the the largest board on the bottom, with all boards facing the same direction and the rockers running the same way.
If the fins aren't removable, place each board nose to tail all deck up, to even out the bulge from the fins and fin blocks on each side of the bag (rockers still run in the same direction). An alternative is to offset each board in the bag, but this is only convenient with two boards and an extra long bag. Lay both boards deck down in the same direction; put the largest board on the bottom and stagger the next.



, You're set to go and reach your vacation destination with the board in one piece. All you need to do now is to stay healthy on the plane!

Hold on with your dominant hand.",How to Ride a Mechanical Bull1," You can either grip the handhold with you palm facing up, or with an over grip with the palm facing down (Brazilian style).; make sure you have a good grip. Sometimes you are provided with a glove for your gripping hand.;
"
"
Focus on squeezing with your thighs.,
Relax your upper body.",How to Ride a Mechanical Bull2," Too many people think the control is on the one hand you're holding on with. You should be using your leg muscles to ""root"" you to the bull.

, The ride operator is going to try to use your upper body weight against you when the bull bows down in front and the rear tips up. Most people get rolled off the front during this maneuver. Your best strategy is to point your heels together and try to lean back when the bull dives forward to counter the momentum and then rhythmically shift your weight the opposite way when the bull tips up in the front. Most importantly, keep your upper body loose and relaxed--if you keep it stiff, the momentum will swing you off the bull."
"
Use your free hand for balance.,
Shift your weight.",How to Ride a Mechanical Bull3," Think about how a tightrope walker uses their hands to maintain balance; you should be doing the same with your free hand. Although it might look like people wave it around just to look cool, it really can help you stay on the bull.Holding a hat in that hand might help, too!

, At times, the operator will make the bull go up, down, left, right and circles. Shifting your weight will help.


If the bull goes up with the head up and rear down, shift your weight in your pelvic area down.
If the bull goes down, with rear up and head down, shift your pelvic area up and lean back just a bit.
If the bull goes left, try to lean a bit right. If the bull goes right, then try leaning a bit left.
When the mechanical bull spins in circles, try to lean in the opposite way, so if it spins left, then lean a bit right. If the bull goes right, then lean left.

You'll need to use a lot of the techniques you use for swimming to propel your board, and furthermore, you'll need to be a good swimmer to swim without your board if you wipe out. Additionally, you should only try bodyboarding if you know that the sea conditions are safe and that there's a lifeguard on duty. You should try bodyboarding with a friend or an instructor instead of by yourself. Once you get more comfortable with it, you can go at it alone.;
, You'll need to attach the leash to your upper arm. This will prevent you from losing the board when you wipe out. Attach the strap to your upper arm tightly, but loosely enough so that your arm is still comfortable. The leash will keep your arm and the board secured together.

, If you're swimming in colder water, you'll need a wet suit to keep your body warm. A rash guard will also do, keeping your body from getting irritated while you're bodyboarding, and protecting you from the sun. They are made of Lycra and can also be worn under your wetsuit to keep chafing or rubbing to a minimum.

, Get some fins with tethers and attach the tethers firmly to your ankles. You'll need fins to help you kick with higher speed, making it easier for you to catch a wave. You should also consider getting a pair of fin socks to wear under your fins, to add an extra layer of warmth and comfort for your feet.

, Before you try to catch a wave, you should have a strong sense of how you should be positioned on the board. Get in the sand and lie on the board with your hands at the top (nose) of the board, and the back (tail) of the board under your lower belly. Keep your weight centered on the board. Once you're in this position, you can practice paddling. Paddle your hands at the side of the board, like you're scooping water towards you, or as if you're doing the free stroke in swimming. Kick your feet under the water for the best propulsion and faster movement while bodyboarding.

, Walk into the water with your board until it's about knee deep. Lift your feet high with every step to avoid getting stuck. You should start looking for white water waves that go straight into the beach.

, Once you've gotten past knee-deep into the water, get on the board in the correct position and start paddling out, toward the waves. Use the paddling motion with your hands and kick with both your feet just below the water's surface for the strongest propulsion. The nose of the board should be about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) above water.

, If you're just starting out, you should avoid any waves that are too high and fast, or generally out of your comfort zone. Pick waves that are headed straight toward the beach and that won't make you travel too high or too fast. Once you've found your wave, you should turn toward the beach and start kicking toward it, waiting to be brought forward by the current of the wave. The wave should be steep enough to move you forward, but it has to not have broken yet.


To improve your chances of finding a good wave, look out for the place where most of the waves are breaking. You should wait for the waves about 5-10 feet beyond that location.

, Once the wave is just five or so feet behind you, you should start kicking as hard as you can while paddling hard. You can also lean forward to gain some extra speed and to make sure you've really got a hold of the wave. Some people prefer not to paddle with both hands, but to keep one hand on the board and to paddle with the other to maintain more control.









If you want to move to the right, you can hold the board's nose with your right hand and paddle with your left hand; if you want to move to the left, then you can hold the board's nose with your left hand and paddle with your right hand.

, You should feel yourself traveling faster as the wave approaches you. If you want some extra speed, you can push down the nose of your board slightly to move even faster. If the wave is moving too fast for your comfort, then you can do the opposite, pushing the nose up an inch or two to get some friction and slow yourself down. Continue to kick your feet as you travel down the face of the wave. You can also lean slightly into the wave to improve your speed.


You can also choose to go right or left here. To go left, lean your hips toward the left side of the board and place your left elbow on the upper left side deck of the board, while holding onto the upper right edge of your board with your free hand. To go right, do the opposite.

, This is considered anywhere that is below knee-deep. You can step out of the ocean and take a break, or go right in and catch another wave. You're free to keep on riding waves as long as you don't feel cold or tired. Once you've caught your first wave, the fun has just begun!









As you ride the wave, remember that your goal should be to achieve ""trim,"" which means the point where your board is riding flat on the surface with as much speed as possible. You'll need to work on leaning forward enough to gather momentum, but not so much that your board doesn't go under. This will reduce your drag and will give you more breathing room.

, Understanding the different parts of a wave will help you develop skills and learn tricks, because you'll know what to look out for. Here are the parts of a wave that you should know:The lip. The breaking part of a wave that moves from top to bottom. The steepness of the wave determines the shape of the lip.

Whitewater. This is the part of the wave that has already broken.

The face. The unbroken, walling part of the wave.

The shoulder. The part of the wave that is just outside the breaking section of the wave's face.

Flats. The flat water you see in front of the breaking wave.

Tube. The hollow hole between the throwing lip and the wall of the wave.

, You'll need to know what the different parts of the board are so you can follow along and learn a number of skills and tricks. Here's what you'll need to know:The deck. The part of the board where you lie down.

Slick bottom. The bottom of the board that has a smooth or slick surface.

The nose. The front of the board that you hold.

The nose bulbs. These are the small bumps on each corner of the board that you will hold with your hands.

The bumpers. The extra foam layer that runs through the nose and tail, helping to keep the slick bottom from peeling.

The rail. The side of the bodyboard.

The tail. The back end of the board.

The channels. The areas on the bottom of the board that reduce drag and speed you up.

The stringer. The rod that keeps the board stiff.

The template. The shape of the board.

The rocker. The level of flatness of the bodyboard.

, This is one of the first tricks you will learn once you've mastered the basics of catching a wave. To do the Forward Spin 360° correctly, you'll have to make a full circle on the wave in one smooth motion. Here's how you do it:









Focus on the direction you want to turn.
Turn back up the wave face in that direction.
As you turn, release your inside rail by sliding your weight forward toward the nose of your board.
Keep your board flat on the surface of the wave to reduce the drag.
Keep your legs raised and crossed as you turn.
Once you've turned a full circle, slide back on your board and center your weight again, continuing to ride.

, This is another one of the first trick tricks you'll learn. The Cut Back is the easiest way to set up your board closer to the power zone of the wave, which is close to where the lip of the wave is breaking. Here's what you do:









Move faster toward the shoulder section (the part just outside the breaking section of the face) of the wave, picking a point where you'll get enough time to start a rounded slow turn.
Begin the rounded slow turn while leaning your board and shifting your weight to the inside rail of the board, starting to cut a path with the edge of the board.
Keep both hands near the nose of the board, on either rail.
Use your arms to pull, creating a smooth arc.
Push down with your hips while extending your legs, to help maintain your balance.
Once the wave catches up to you, center your weight again and continue riding the wave.

, This is another trick for relative newcomers to bodyboarding. You can do this trick in any size wave. To do the ""El Rollo,"" you have to travel down the wave and do a full flip with your board, using the strength of the wave to carry you in an arc. Here's how you do it:









Drive off the bottom of the wave, focusing on the breaking lip ahead.
Move up towards the lip of the wave.
Use the wave's power to throw you out with the lip into a perfect arc.
Let the wave move you in a roll while you steer the board and work on finding a place to land it.
As you drop down, you need to center your weight above your board, bracing your hands, arms, and elbows to absorb the downward fall. This takes some of the pressure off your back.
Try to land horizontally in the whitewater, not in the flats.

, This is more of a skill than a trick, which allows you to get your board under a breaking wave that you don't want to catch. It helps you get through all the whitewash towards the waves you do want to catch. Once you get it right, you'll be able to get to the line-up, or the waves, much more quickly. Here's what you have to do:









Paddle toward the wave to pick up more speed.
When the wave is about 3-6 feet (1-2 meters) away from you, slide forward and grab the rails of the board, about 10 inches (30 cm) down from the nose.
Push the nose of the board under the surface by arching your back and pushing down on the nose with your hands. Get as deep under the water as you can.
Use your knees on the deck, near the tail, to keep it moving down and forward.
Dive underneath the wave, pulling your body closer to your board.
As the wave passes over you, move your weight back toward your knees, lifting the nose of your board up and out the back of the wave, until you move toward the surface of the water.

, Stalling is an important skill for any bodyboarder to have. You can use stalling to brake in a number situations, such as when you need to slow down the tubing section of a wave. Here are the two ways to do it:


Drag your legs in the water to slow you down, or move your hips more to the inside rail of the board.
Pull up on the nose of the board while applying downward pressure on the tail with your hips. Hold the board at a downward angle of about 30-45° until you reach the speed you want.
When you finish stalling, slide up on the the board to pick up speed and then set your rail and continue moving forward.

Rock on.,
Be prepared for chewing.",How to Choose a Surfboard for Your Dog," Boogie boards have the speed and maneuverability that a dog may be able to maneuver better. It is small and a dog tends to feel that it can control it better, so this is the best board to start your dog with.;
, Hard fiberglass resin boards are tough for a dog to grip but easier to walk on. This means less chewing and tears, but foam boards are great too as they won't hurt your dog if it were to wipe out and accidentally get bumped by the board. There seems to be some controversy about which board is better. It's really a matter of choice; they both have good things and bad things. If you do use a resin top, reduce the slipperiness by putting on a deck patch(traction for your dogs paws so he doesn't slip). Whatever board you choose, don't forget to take the wax out of your dog's paws.

, As your dog progresses from the boogie board, a longer board allows for more margin of error. Your dog can navigate from the nose of the board. It is also great for tandem surfing with you, as your dog can grip on to the board at the nose and get better traction with the claws.

, The more curvature to the board, the easier it is for your dog balance on the wave. The older boogie boards tend to have more curve, are softer, and are better for dogs to balance on. The newer ones are very flat. You might be able to pick up older ones from online auctions or used surfboard dealers.

, Your dog will become attached to its favorite board and in response, will probably chew it. Expect it, along with all the claw marks from digging in. See it as your dog modifying the board for its own personal use. And in other words, if it's your prize board and you don't want bite or claw marks in it, don't use it with Fido!

You'll usually be able to choose between fiberglass boards and soft surfboards, sometimes called “soft tops” or ""foamies.""Soft surfboards are lightweight and much cheaper than epoxy or fiberglass boards. Soft boards are extremely buoyant and durable, making them a good choice for beginners.Your size and weight will contribute to determining which type of board you should learn on.The more weight you have, the bigger the board volume you will need. You may not have a good experience learning to surf if you are trying to learn on a board that is too small for you.
If you're not sure what you want, talk to people at the surf shop. Be honest and tell them that you're a first-timer and you want to know what you need to get started.;
, While they're not quite as maneuverable or versatile as other types of boards, longboards are often recommended for beginners because of their ease of use.The more volume a longboard has, the easier it is to balance and paddle into waves. This makes for more enjoyable experiences for most learners.
If you've tried a longboard and want something a little more maneuverable, you should try a funboard.Funboards are hybrid boards which are a bit shorter than longboards, typically 7–8.5 feet (2.1–2.6 m). Funboards combine the smoothness and stability of a longboard with some of the agility of a shortboard.

, Shortboards are less than seven feet long, with a sharp nose and multiple fins. It takes more practice to master a shortboard than longer types of surfboards, but it is considered the definitive high-performance board for the pros (though some professional surfers use longboards as well).


Fish boards are even shorter than shortboards and much wider.The fish board’s flatness and small profile make it ideal for riding small surf that other boards sometimes struggle with. It's a great board for intermediate and advanced surfers.
Alternatively, The gun is another more advanced board.These boards are thin boards with very thin noses designed for experts surfing the very biggest waves. It can handle steep drops and high speeds with ease, but it’s hard to control if you're a beginner.

, In many places, a wetsuit is just as essential as the board itself to ensure an enjoyable surfing experience.The wetsuit keeps your body warm in cold water, helping prevent chills and hypothermia. If the local surf shop recommends a wetsuit, get fitted and rent or purchase one before you hit the beach.

, Ask your surf shop which type is appropriate for the temperature of the water you will be surfing in.


Make sure not to get the wax sandy! This makes it very abrasive and can hurt your stomach.

, If you wipe out, you don't want to be stuck out in the breaking waves without a board. You also don't want your board floating freely into other surfers or smashing up against the rocks. A runaway board can be very dangerous for anyone in the water, not to mention potentially costly.


Also, be sure to have a leash string, which connects your leash to the leash plug located at the tail of the board.

, Attach the leash to your back foot and to the tail of your board, then lie belly-down on the board so that your body is lined up straight down the middle of the board. From this position, practice your paddling motion with both arms to get a sense of the muscles that you will be working.










If you're right-handed, your back foot will generally be your right foot. This is called ""regular"" stance. It's called ""goofy"" stance when the leash is on your left foot. When in doubt, just do what feels most natural.
Don't just jump into the water when you're first learning to surf, or you'll get frustrated quickly. Take a little bit of time to practice on the sand, or in the privacy of your backyard, before you're on the beach in front of others.

, ""Taking off""(or “popping up”) on the wave and standing up on the board takes a bit of practice. While lying on the board, bring your hands up from paddling and place your hands below your chest, palms on the flat of the board while your fingers curl over the sides of the surfboard.








In one quick motion, push your body up with your arms and tuck your feet up and under you. Place one foot where your hands pushed up from and the other at least a shoulder’s width behind.
As you are beginning, you may find it easier to get up to your knees first and then bring up one foot at a time until you are in a standing position. It's slower than the jump up, but it works effectively for someone not ready for the jump up.Never grab the rails, or edges, of the board during your take off, unless you want to get a nice gash on your chin when your hands slip off your rail.
If you find your hands or feet slipping when you try to get up, you may need to rub more wax on your board.
You can practice jumping up without a surfboard present, so feel free to do it wherever you have a bit of space until you feel comfortable doing it.

, Once you've taken off, keep your knees bent, your arms loose and extended, your feet planted on the board, and your torso leaned forward to lower your center of gravity.










Depending on which foot comes naturally in front, you'll be either a ""regular foot"" or ""goofy foot."" Regular foot means that your left foot is in front, while goofy foot means your right foot leads.Beginners have a tendency to adopt a squatty stance when learning. Their feet are widely spread apart from bow to stern of their boards. This might feel comfortable, but it actually makes it harder to control. Balance is side-to-side, not front to back. You will notice that experienced surfers usually ride with their feet much closer together.
A proper stance includes keeping your eyes looking in the direction you are going.

, A good “go-to” balance position is having your toes touching the leash string.










If your nose is too high up, you're too far back on the board. If it digs water, you're too far forward. It is essential to find the sweet spot, as that is where you will achieve maximum paddling efficiency.
Paddle with long, deep strokes from as far forward to as far back as you can comfortably reach., The best way to practice and prepare for hitting the beach is with another person nearby who knows more about surfing than you do, and can provide feedback and advice.


If you have a friend who surfs, ask for help. Friends don't usually charge and you can practice privacy of your own home rather than on the beach in front of others.
Pay an instructor. This is the most reliable way to learn the basics of surfing in a clear, methodical way. For a fee, he or she will teach you all you need to know and give you pointers that will help you get out into the surf and having fun quickly.

, Before you plan to surf, visit a couple good surfing beaches and take a good long swim to make sure you feel confident in the water. Never surf anywhere you aren't comfortable swimming on your own.










Ask around for advice. Ask your local surf shop or surfers at advanced surf breaks where beginners should surf. They will be happy to point you to an appropriate spot.
Check online. If you can't find any advice that seems reliable, go online and search for recommendations there. You will often be able to find discussion boards for local surfers that have good information.
Play it safe. If there is a lifeguard tower, plan to surf at a time when the lifeguard is on duty. Take some time to ask other surfers on the beach if they have any advice or warnings for you.

, Here are a few basic safety rules to keep in mind:


Respect the right of way. When there is more than one surfer paddling to catch a wave, the person who has paddled closest to the peak has the right of way for that wave.
Don't ""drop in"" on others. Paddling to catch or dropping into a wave while someone is already riding closer to the peak is considered rude and potentially dangerous.Remember to scan the line of the wave for other surfers before you try to catch it.
Very popular and busy beginner surfing locations don't usually have these strict rules and multiple people will often ride the same wave (sometimes referred to as a ""party wave""). If two people are waiting on the same wave, whichever person catches it first and is closer to the peak has the right of way.

, You want to be waist deep in the white water, where the waves have already broken. This is the best place to start when you're a beginner. Don't plan on paddling too far out where more advanced surfers might be waiting for a set, but make sure you are in deep enough water to keep from hitting your head if should you fall off your board.










Pick a reference point. Choose a landmark on the shore and glance at it periodically as you move into deeper water. This will help you gauge your distance from shore, and can help to reveal any hidden currents that might be moving you.

, When you're ready to go out into the waves, walk your board out until you're about waist- or chest-deep, then lie on the board and paddle straight into the waves.










Paddle straight when you are paddling out. If you hit the waves at a glancing angle, you will lose the forward momentum you've built up. Stay perpendicular to the oncoming waves and “cut” through them instead.
As you “cut” through a wave, it helps to do a push-up with your upper body as you go over or through the wave.This prevents the wave from pushing you back to shore.

, Kick your legs in an egg beater motion to turn the board around toward the shore. Position yourself in your sweet spot and get ready to paddle for the wave using long, smooth, deep strokes.


When you see a wave coming, get into position as near the peak as you can without appearing to be a ""wave hog."" When you are satisfied that you are in a good position to catch the wave, paddle like there's no tomorrow and give it all you've got!

, When you have a good sense of the speed and motion of the wave and you feel that sense that you've caught its momentum, take off using the techniques you've been practicing.








Keep looking forward as you paddle. When you turn around, you lose power.
Be quick. You want to catch the wave before it breaks, so you have time to get up on the board. It is often common for beginners to catch and ride the “white water” (which is a fine way to begin).Be patient. If you miss a wave, just paddle back out and wait for the next likely candidate.

, You're now surfing your first wave! Stay focused and let it carry you in to shore. Keep an eye out for others in the water while you are surfing.










Start simple. At first, you should ride each wave straight in. This is a shorter and slower way to ride than angling on a wave, but it is easier to get the hang of.

, As you become accustomed to the feeling of surfing, you will probably want to try angling your board across a wave. Lean into your turn with your body, keeping your center of gravity on the board. Use your body to gently dip one rail of your board into the face of the wave. This creates friction/drag that will turn the board. Once you catch the right angle, maintain balance and ride down the curl of the wave.










Pick the direction you want to ride across the wave (left or right) early. If the wave is low enough, begin paddling in that direction before the wave hits. For larger waves, wait until you are getting pulled up onto the wave.

, If you feel yourself falling, or if the wave dies down, jump away from the board towards the ocean and away from your momentum.A good idea is to fall to the side or the back of the board, covering your head with your arms as you fall.Go with the flow, letting the wave carry you. Swim upwards gently and feel what’s ahead of you to avoid getting hit by the board.


Try to land flat so that you won’t injure yourself in shallow water or on a reef.
Once you have safely surfaced, pull your leash and climb back onto your board to prevent it from scything or flopping through the water, which can cause serious injury to you or others. Climb aboard, rest on your belly, and regain control.
Most wipe out injuries happen as a result of the board hitting the surfer. Always remember to bail to the ocean side of your board. You don't want to be between the beach and your board when a wave has control of the board.
If you are riding for the very first time, it's great to rent a foam surfboard rather than a fiberglass one, as they are softer and less likely to cause you injury while learning.

, After you wipeout or bail, you need to get out of the way so that other people can surf. Don't paddle up the middle of the break where other surfers will be coming. Instead, paddle off to the side first, to keep the wave zone clear.

, You'll probably slide or fall off the first few times, but don't be deterred. Some people can learn in an afternoon, while others take a few weeks to get the hang of things. Keep trying and you'll eventually make it.


Avoid getting to your knees and stopping. If you're going to commit, commit and stand up. Going to your knees is like saddling the horse but not riding it.
Enjoy the ocean and have fun.

How to release the friction knot when finished.",How to Build a Slackline," Slacklines are typically built from 1"" (25mm) tubular webbing, although other materials can be used. A typical setup includes:


50 feet (15 meters) (or more) of webbing for the main line
2 pieces of 10-15 foot (3-4.5 meter) lengths of 1"" (25mm) tubular webbing for the anchors
5 carabiners (climbing-strength, oval-shaped)
2 pieces of carpet, cardboard or other sturdy material for protecting the tree anchors.;
, A good length for beginners is about 15-20 feet between anchors. Find an area clear of sharp objects--smooth grassy areas are ideal. Shorter spans are easier to learn on than longer spans and allow for a lower line.

, Choose anchors capable of holding about 500-1000 pounds (226 kg-453 kg) of lateral force: medium-to-large trees, cemented poles, truck hitches, eye-bolts, etc. When using trees for anchors, make sure to protect the trees by padding the area of contact with carpet or other sturdy material. Wrap the loop of webbing around the first anchor about 2-3 feet (60-90cm) off the ground for a 15-20 foot (4.5-6 meters) length. Attach a carabiner to the two ends. Repeat for the second anchor using two carabiners instead of one.

, Wrap a tied loop of webbing around the anchor and attach a carabiner through the two end loops.

,,


From the line locker, pass the webbing top-to-bottom through carabiner_1 attached to the anchor, then top-to-bottom through the carabiner with the line locker.
Next, pass the webbing bottom-to-top through carabiner_2. You should have a zig-zag pattern connecting the carabiners--the ""pulley"".
Now for the tricky part: pass the webbing bottom-to-top UNDER the loop of webbing on the line locker carabiner. This creates a friction lock on the webbing. No additional knots are required.
Pull tightly, using about 50-100lbs (or more) of pulling force.
Test the line by sitting or bouncing on it. This helps take the stretch out of the anchors and knots. Tighten the line until you can walk the middle of it without it touching the ground.

, You can experiment with tying the line very taut or moderately taut. If the line is too loose, it will lose many of its dynamic qualities and sag excessively.

, This is easily and safely done by pulling the webbing in the opposite direction that you tightened the line. Normally, this means pulling the webbing away from the nearest anchor.

, While lying down or sitting, focus on clearing your mind of all extra thoughts and worries. Don’t move your body around; sit as still as possible. This lowers your blood pulse. A lowered pulse means your body is using less oxygen.Your body needs oxygen to move and function. The less you move, the less oxygen your body will need.
First, practice holding your breath without moving. Then, add in simple, slow movements like walking to train your body to conserve oxygen. This will prepare your body to dive and swim with less air.

, You should feel your belly rise instead of your shoulders if you’re using your diaphragm to inhale. Your diaphragm is the muscle attached to the bottom of your lungs that helps expand your lungs to hold more oxygen.Start inhaling for 5 seconds at a time. Then, increase by a few seconds every time you inhale. You will be stretching out your lungs and increasing their ability to hold more air.
Puffing up your cheeks does not mean that you have enough oxygen. It makes you use face muscles that spend oxygen instead of conserving it.

, While you hold your breath, let out little puffs of air at a time. You will feel your body try and force you to exhale completely. These little convulsions are your body telling you that carbon dioxide is building up in your lungs.Push out as much air as possible when you’ve finished to get rid of any extra carbon dioxide.
As you hold your breath, your body turns oxygen into carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is toxic to your body and can cause you to pass out.
Once you get past the convulsions, your spleen releases more oxygen-filled blood into your bloodstream. Hold your breath past this point to be able to hold it even longer., Every time you repeat a breath cycle, push yourself to go a little longer each time. Breathe in and out for two minutes at a time, keeping yourself at a calm and even pace. You are training your body to handle being without oxygen., Before going underwater, spend five minutes breathing in and out slowly like you've practiced. Relax your body as well while sitting or standing in the shallow end of a pool or body of water.

, Take one deep breath through your mouth and lower yourself below the surface of the water. Keep your mouth and nose closed while underwater.


Use your fingers to hold your nose shut if you need.
Staying relaxed is important since there is more risk in holding your breath underwater than on land.

, Once you've reached your body's limit, swim or push yourself to the surface. Blow out any extra air as you rise so that you can take a fresh breath immediately.


Before diving again, take another two to five minutes to do a few breath cycles to get your body back to normal oxygen levels.
If you begin to panic at any moment, relax and surface. Panicking can lead to accidental inhalation underwater, which can cause drowning.

, Swimming and forcing your body to dive deeper will use up more oxygen. Don’t try to exert yourself right away.


When diving, you want to remain as relaxed and calm as possible, keeping your pulse low.
Swimming is the complete opposite. Your pulse will be high and your muscles moving quickly., As you begin to go longer without breath, avoid using a timer or counting seconds because you will mentally psych yourself out.Instead, measure how far you can swim across the pool or how deep you can go before needing air.


If you want to keep track of your time, have a friend time you instead.

, Practicing alone is dangerous because you cannot help yourself to safety if you pass out or begin choking or drowning. To be extra safe, make sure that your partner is CPR trained so if there’s an emergency, they’re able to help you out.

, This way you can stand or sit while going underwater. Treading water requires extra energy that uses your precious oxygen. It’s also easier to get to the surface quickly in case you need air or have an emergency.

, If you’re vision begins to fade or you feel light-headed, go to the surface immediately. Risking your personal safety is not as important as a few extra seconds underwater.

Don't forget to do a pullout. Pullouts give you a head start and make your stroke faster.
Do pullouts off of starts and turns.;
, Make sure your palms are facing out and your elbows are straight.









, Now simply push your hands forward so they return to where they started. Do not make your arms go wide open, but do not make a tiny circle either. Also, when both of your hands get to your chest, breathe, and shoot them out quickly side by side, palms up.









, Do not remove your hands from the water.









, Make a circular motion with your feet until they meet with your legs fully extended once again. Complete this step as fast as possible.










Start your kick about when you are breathing. You can start a little earlier but no later.

, But not for too long. In competitions, DO NOT go over 1 or 2 seconds, as it will slow you down a lot.










Without gliding for too long don't forget to glide and don't a short glide. Give yourself a fair glide time.

, This WILL give you automatic disqualification. If you want to take your breath every other stroke, then you have to lift your head up and put it back down. If you don't and just do 2 strokes without lifting up your head, you will be disqualified, so make sure that you at least lift up your head. Also, when you take a breath, do not look up. Instead, look down at the water. With every stroke of your hands and arms, it will take your head up automatically so don't move your head, as it will waste your energy. When you are almost finished, touch the shore with both hands at the same time, or else you will be disqualified.

If you already have one then good, they will really help you in your swimming career.;
, You should be doing an all-out in your 50 meter freestyle, and breathing minimally. Some swimmers tend to fatigue and slow down on their last 25 meters, resulting to a slow 50 freestyle. Doing dry land exercises will greatly contribute in increasing your fitness level and stamina. Planks, push-ups, sit-ups, and running are a few. The intensity of these workouts might vary with age, gender and level of swimmers. Ask your coach for a workout plan for you.

, A well executed dive can trim as much as 3 seconds of your time, so make sure you make the most out of your dive. Have a friend video you as you dive. Observe the video and look at your flaws. Are your legs and arms straight? Is your core tight and contracted? Does your body enter the water in a narrow hole? Does it take you a long time to react to the go signal? Evaluate your dive and list the areas you need to improve. Now that you know what you have to do and improve, go back to the pool and continue to practice to dive (your friend will continue to video you). Continue to practice until you can finally dive sharply and make the most out of your dive.

, Underwater dolphin kicks are essential to keep the momentum from your dive, and will definitely increase your time when done properly. Start from your dive phase when practicing this so you have a feel on the momentum from your dive. Go to the diving block, dive, do your underwater dolphins and swim 5 strokes of freestyle. Make sure to have a friend video this. Did you start your stroke too early and immediately kill the momentum from your dive? Were you too slow underwater? Was your dive to deep and gave you a hard time to recover? Observe the video and look at the distance covered by your underwater dolphins and the time it took. Make sure the distance does not exceed 15 meters, as doing so will get you disqualified in a race. Go continue your practice again and try to beat your previous time in this exercise. Try big kicks and small kicks and get which one works best for you by comparing the time of each technique. The size and speed of the dolphin kicks can vary with different person's height and built.

, Make your strokes efficient by making less drag while swimming. Stretch your arms forward as if you are reaching something then pull down as fast as you can. Doing pull sets can help you with increasing the power and velocity created by your pulls. The best one to ask about the intensity and your workout plan is your coach, as again, the intensity can vary from swimmer to swimmer. Make sure you have a good stretch before you do the pull sets to prevent shoulder injuries.

, Get a kick board and let a friend time your 50 meter time kicking. To improve your speed kick faster and harder. Contract your butt muscles to increase the speed and efficiency of your kicks. Imagine a coin in your butt and try your best to squeeze it and keep it in place. You will know when you have the right technique, when your time in your 50 kick drops.

, The touch is one of the most awaited part in any race. It tells who the winner will be. The 50 meter freestyle is a very tight race, so the speed of your last 5 meters and the touch will greatly affect your time. Once you see the flag (5 meter mark) kick as hard as you can, pull harder and try to start your estimation on which hand will touch the wall. It is important to not breathe on this last 5 meter of the race. End the race with a full stroke. Meaning, touch the wall with a fully extended arm. Don't breathe on your last stroke and keep your head down. Make sure you give all the energy that you have left on this phase.

, Start resting and decreasing your workload, 2 weeks before your competition. A well rested body will give you more energy, thus giving a better result and a faster swim.

, Give your body the nutrition and energy it needs to go at it's maximum performance level. Eat a light meal before your race. You don't want to upset your stomach and have problems during the race.

, You have to stay focused on the race itself. Think about beating your best time. Don't feel scared, afraid, or nervous on the race. Instead, think that you will be the first to finish, and try your best to do it. With a well rested and fed body, right mindset, proper dive, underwater dolphins, pulls, kicks, and finish, nothing can stop you from beating your best time and win. Let your opponents eat your bubbles!

Find two walls around 1–2 meters (3.3–6.6 ft) tall which are reasonably close to each other (around 2-3 metres between the two walls).,
Before you attempt the technique it is important to learn the correct take-off method.,
After you have mastered the correct take-off method, attempt the complete Tic tac.

Perform the take-off method.

,
However, as you push away from the wall, turn your body to face the opposite wall and extend your arms and legs in preparation for landing on the second wall.

,
As you land on the second wall, land with your legs first.,
You will now be in a hanging position.

,
Using the technique which you can learn in the wikiHow guide ‘Perform an Advanced Wall Climb in Parkour’, you can now climb the wall.

,
Practice!",How to Do a Tic Tac in Parkour,";
,


Approach the first wall at a forty-five degree angle at a steady jog.






About a pace from the wall, launch yourself at the wall from your preferred foot. (If you are right handed, this will be your right foot and vice versa)






Your foot should contact the wall a little higher than the height of your kneecap. (This will be higher as you improve)






As your foot makes contact, push explosively AWAY from the wall so your body travels away from the wall in the direction of the second wall.






Land on the ground. Do not try hanging on to the second wall yet.







,,,, This will absorb the impact of the landing and then you can place your hands on the top of the wall.

Make sure the front knee is over the midline of the foot.,
Jump as high as you can.,
Bring your feet together.,
Return to your original position.,
Repeat this process for a set round of repetitions.",How to Do a Split Jump1," The proper shoes for doing a split jump will be able to absorb the shock of your body weight jumping at full force onto the floor. Good quality running shoes or gym shoes should fit snugly, but not tightly, and your toes should not feel constricted.Arch supports may be helpful if you have weak arches.
Lightweight shoes with a good grip and cushioning are best for split jumps, but any shoes that feel right on your feet will work.;
, Start with your right foot placed about 3 feet in front of the other. Make sure your weight is evenly balanced between your two feet, and that both feet are relaxed. Your ankles should be strong and limber, not bent.If you tend to bear your body weight on one side or the other, check and see that you are balancing your weight evenly.
The exact distance apart your feet are held at the start of this exercise will vary based on your own body's size.

, Your left heel will rise off the floor while your body weight will be balanced between the ball of your left foot and your full right foot.Your right knee will bend as well, as your right calf remains perpendicular to the floor.
You will feel this stretch most acutely in your right thigh, or quadriceps (quads).

, If your knee is overly extended, you can pull a tendon. If it isn't over the midline, you won't be getting the full benefit of the stretch.

It can be difficult to determine the accuracy of your angle by yourself. If you can, check in a mirror or ask a coach for help.
You shouldn't feel any pinching, or sharp, shooting pains in your knee. If you notice any sharp pains, you may be pushing the angle of your knee too tightly.

, Both of your feet should come off the ground. You'll use the strength of your calf muscles, your ankles, and your quads, to jump. Use your arms to help your upward momentum, and for balance.

You may have to practice this action for a while, as jumping from a lunging position uses muscles in an unfamiliar way at first.
Your legs should relax their angles, and hang vertically from your torso mid-jump.

, This will feel natural as you jump, as your legs will also be held loosely together. Your knees may both bend slightly, as you work to gain vertical distance from the ground.Your feet shouldn't feel forced to touch one another.
Enjoy the sensation of feeling your body suspended midair. You want your attention to be in the present, neither in the past (in your pre-jumping position) or the future (deciding the way you'll land).

, As gravity brings your body back to the floor or ground, move your right foot forward. You should find yourself back in your original position, with your left knee bent, and your right knee held at a an angle with your foot flat on the ground. Landing in this way should also help absorb the shock of impact.You may find that you need your arms for balance as you land.
Do not allow your left knee to hit the ground hard, as this may result in bruising or injury.

, The number of repetitions, or reps, you do will vary depending on your strength and skill with the exercise. For a beginner, you may decide to do 5-10 reps. Someone more experienced may choose to do 20-25 or more reps.

When you've done the reps with your left knee bent, repeat with your right knee bent.
Doing these exercises at a rapid rate will a great workout for your quads.

Do bodyweight squats.,
Add sprints to your workout.,
Do planks, not sit-ups, to increase core strength.,
Use jumps as regular part of your work out.",How to Do a Split Jump2," These exercises will strengthen your quads for better split jumps. To start, stand with your feet directly beneath your hips, your toes facing forward. Lower your torso, like you're sitting in a chair, without letting your knees angle forward beyond your toes. When you've reached about a 90 degree angle in your knees, pause, then come back up to standing.Do this 8-12 times to start with.
If you want to add some challenge, hold dumbbells in each hand while you do this.

, Doing short, fast runs or sprints greatly improves your quads as well as your aerobic conditioning. You don't need to go long distances, and you can do sprints just about anywhere. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced athlete, add 3-4 sets of 40 yard sprints to your daily workout.Try to find a softer surface to sprint on, such as grass or a trail. This will prevent any possible injury due to stress from running on harder surfaces.
When sprinting, lift your knees high to maximize your workout. Pump your arms to give yourself momentum.

, Current research shows that the best way to increase core strength is to hold your body in a plank position. A plank position is holding the body parallel to the floor, balanced on your toes and your elbows or your hands. Hold the plank position as long as you can, neither lowering your body nor raising your buttocks.You can also hold your plank for a set amount of time before lowering gently to the ground. You should control your descent so that all of your body touches the ground at the same time.
Sit-ups employ only a few muscles, and may result in back injury. Plank positions use a wide variety of core muscles and are more effective at overall strengthening.

, Jumping rope, or doing box jumps will help strengthen your core, and support your split jump practice. To do a box jump, use a small platform. Stand in front of the box with both feet on the ground. You'll use your core strength, your quads and your calves to jump with both feet from the floor to the surface of the platform.You should land on your right foot, followed by your left. When you've landed, immediately jump back off, onto the ground, again landing first on your right foot.
Your platform, or box, can be any height but most people prefer a platform that's 12-24 inches from the ground.
It might feel natural to swing your arms slightly when attempting this jump.

Twist your upper body to follow the rotation of your head.,
Kick downwards, not away from where you're going, so that you can get the height you need.,
Catch the ledge.,
Hang on tight.,
Once your body has swung sideways and starts to swing back, use the momentum to help get your leg between your body and climb over the wall.

",How to Do a Tic Tac 270 Wall Climb in Parkour," If you prefer to kick off with your right leg, your climbing wall should be on your right (and vice versa).;
,,, Your arms should be in position to catch the target wall.

, By this time, your arms should be high to catch that wall, and protect your face in case you over-rotate.

, This will be tricky and take a lot of practice.

, A good grip helps, as the momentum of your body will carry you sideways. Let it.

, If you crouch too much you will lose all your force while jumping. Focus your eyes in the direction you are going.

, Make sure that you throw your hands upwards and aimed towards the wall. Get height in your jump, not just forward momentum. This will prevent your smashing your knees into the wall and at the same time, get them into position to control your 'slide' or contact.

, Keep your arms high, to allow you to grab the wall easily.

,,,,, Your legs should also be bent slightly,

Find other Traceurs or Traceuses in your area, and attend a jam session to learn from them before attempting anything big.,
Practice, practice, practice!,

While practicing in a controlled environment to get the moves down is good, Parkour is spontaneous, and once you get the general feel of the moves, go for a run, and learn to apply Parkour in any situation.

,
Parkour is also about knowing your limits, if you don't think you can do something, practice small, and work your way up to it!

",How to Become an Expert at Parkour," For example, a roll from right shoulder to left hip or left shoulder to right hip (not a somersault). This is the most important move in Parkour, as it is essential for landing jumps while preserving your forward momentum, allowing you to continue running. There are a few variations to the roll, such as the dive roll, but remember, Parkour is not as easy as it looks. A roll in Parkour is meant to 'flow', allowing you to preserve your forward momentum and continue running. While you may think you have 'mastered' the roll, remember to keep practicing the basics, even once you have gone far beyond them.;
, If you are just beginning with Parkour, this is one of the best ways to go, because learning straight from others is much better than watching videos on YouTube.

, There's no such thing as practicing too much.

, Parkour, while a great work out in itself, is not enough to keep going, if you want to get better, you need to condition your body. Go for runs, go to the gym, etc. Also, your body, namely your knees, take a lot of impact. You want to condition them to be able to take the abuse.

, Keep your fingers pointed toward the tops of your shoulders.

, Your spine beneath your shoulders and your rear should be in the air.








, The most important part is to kick upwards as hard as you can, not at an angle.









Your body should fly into the air from the force of you kicking your legs.

, Picture that you're doing a backwards push-up, and push as hard as you can.









Try to make this movement as explosive as possible.






There's no turning back at this point — you either complete the kick-up or land flat on your back. Time to give it your all!







, When you feel that sensation of weightlessness just before you're about to fall downwards, pull your legs downward as quickly as you can. Snap them down hard, and the momentum will cause the rest of your body to whirl upwards (land on your toes first). You'll suddenly, almost magically, be on your feet.

, For a face-down kip-up, you can use flat palms or fists — whichever works best for you.

, Move your arms like you're doing a pushup, while flipping your legs back hard. Between the momentum in your legs and the slight push upwards from your hands, you should be able to flip into a squatting position.

Tuck your knees.,
Land your flip.",How to Run up a Wall and Flip1," Before you try doing a wall flip, it’s important to know some basic flip moves in order to have a foundational knowledge and comfort in the movements your body needs to do to execute a wall flip.Some of these foundational prerequisite moves include a standing back tuck, a back handspring, a front flip, and even a side flip.While you begin learning how to do a wall flip, it’s a good idea to practice with soft landing tumbling mats or grass, and have a qualified spotter there to help you with your flip.;
, Run or jog toward the wall you plan to flip from. Your chosen wall should have a relatively rough surface so your shoes can grip onto the wall.A common misconception is that you need to sprint toward the wall to get enough power to do your flip. However, too much momentum going forward, toward the wall, will make it harder to transition your power into the upward movement needed to complete the flip.When you run toward the wall, you want your non-dominant foot to remain on the ground when your dominant foot pulls up to plant on the wall. Your non-dominant foot should be about 12”- 24” away from the base of the wall.


Practice running toward the wall a few times in order to gauge how far back you need to start, how quickly you need run, and where you need to position yourself to have your feet land where they need to be.
It may help to initially begin practicing walls flip on an obtuse angled wall, angled away from you.The angle of the wall will help your foot grip and plant on the wall, making your back flip a little bit easier.

, As you go to take the last step of your run up toward the wall, swing your arms back behind you.The next sequence would be to plant your dominant foot on the wall, but before you get there, you should know the general movement of your arms so you can do the movements all together in the correct order. When you plant your dominant foot on the wall, swing your arms forward toward the wall. When your arms come across the sides of your body, bend your elbows to swing your arms in a double upper cut formation.Your arms should look like you are doing a chin up on an invisible bar.


If you try to do a full arm swing with your arms completely extended out in front of you, you run the risk of punching the wall as you plant your foot on the wall.Also, if your arms are extended, it will slow down your spin as you try to flip off the wall.

, Jump off your non-dominant leg on the ground, and plant the ball of your dominant foot on the wall at about the height of your hip.When you bring your foot up to the wall, keep your shin straight and vertical.This will ensure that when you push off your planted foot, you jump vertically up the wall rather than horizontally off the wall.


If you lean in too much when you plant your foot, and your shin is slanted toward the wall, you will lose your gripping on the wall and your foot will slide down., Push and jump up with your dominant foot that’s already planted on the wall. Along with jumping from your non-dominant foot, this will give you two sources of vertical momentum.As you push up on the wall with your dominant foot, your body will rise vertically, but also move away from the wall horizontally and diagonally.Your planted dominant foot should propel you upward as if you are climbing up the wall. This will give you the needed height to properly perform the wall flip.
From this point in midair, you will then begin to transition into rotating backward.

, Once you are up in the air and start to move back away from the wall, swing and drive your non-dominant leg’s knee up to your body to begin the rotation in your flip.The momentum from you swinging your knee will initiate the backward rotation.


Keep your head, arms, and legs tucked tight into your body, like a ball.Keeping your body tucked tight will help you complete a full rotation in your flip.
Don’t throw your head back to initiation your flip rotation. This will open up and extend your body, which will slow down your flip and cause you to land incorrectly.To help keep your head tucked in, try pick a spot on the wall and hold your gaze there for as long as you can before you start to flip.

, As you drive your non-dominant leg’s knee up to your body, your dominant foot that was planted on the wall is going to release from the wall. The knee you are driving up will begin to spin your body. As you start to rotate, pull both of your knees into your body to create a tight ball.At this point, you can even use your hands to hold onto your knees as you spin.Again, tight body posture will help make a clean, controlled flip. If you keep your body open and arch your back (by throwing back your head) you’re going to flip a lot slower, and you might land at an awkward and dangerous angle.
Tucking your knees will help ensure that when you complete your flip, you will land evenly on both of your feet.

, As you flip and see the ground underneath you, open up your body. Bring your arms out from the center of your body and push your knees down toward the ground.You want to try and land on the balls of your feet.If you extend your legs out straight, you will end up landing on your heels and lose balance, causing you to fall on your buttocks."

Push yourself off and keep running.,
Practice over and over.,
Build up your core body strength.,
Work on your flexibility.,
Practice with progression steps.",How to Dash Vault," Approach the obstacle perpendicularly and straight on. Make sure you are also maintaining speed so you can clear the obstacle without any issue. The point of a dash vault is to skim over the top of an obstacle, rather than the up-and-over of other types of vaults.


Your speed will depend on the depth or width of the obstacle you are vaulting over. For example, if it’s a thin wall, you won’t need as much speed. However, if it’s a thicker surface, you will need to go faster to clear it.;
, The trick is to bring one leg up first and then follow with the other quickly. This gives the illusion that both legs are coming up together. It’s important here to take off with your dominant leg or the one you are more comfortable with.Imagine the way an athlete clears a hurdle; bend your dominant leg in a similar manner, slightly at the knee. Then, when you kick this leg forward, your other leg will naturally follow your momentum and you can bring it forward.
Make sure you are leaning back when jumping. Otherwise, your chest will prevent you from bringing your leg up for enough to clear the obstacle.

, Wait until your posterior has cleared the obstacle before putting your hands down on the edge of the item you're vaulting. If you started your jump feet-first like you were supposed to, your arms will be behind you anyways.

, Make this a near seamless movement. You want your body to continue past the obstacle without losing speed. This way, when you touch back down, you can keep running without stopping or slowing down.Actively push the obstacle away from you, so your arms are stretched out behind you and the rest of your body is pushed forward.
Then land one foot first, before the other, so you can go right back into a run.

, Don’t feel discouraged if you can’t perfect a dash vault immediately. It’s one of the most difficult vaults in parkour and should be taken slowly. However, after you’ve done it repeatedly, it will become second nature.

, Like most of parkour, performing a dash vault takes a lot of coordination and body strength. In order to get your body into the proper L-position for this dash, you need to make sure you have a basic foundation of core body strength. To do this, practice L-sits, butt scoots, leg lifts, and knee raises.The L-sit, in particular, will help you build the needed body strength to successfully hold the L-shape of a dash vault.

, Outside of core strength, flexibility plays a large role in performing a dash vault. You need to be able to get both your legs out in front of you while “jumping” over an obstacle. To improve your flexibility, try practicing some basic yoga, pilates, or taking a dance class. Also stretch regularly for 10-15 minutes every morning and evening., The last thing you need to conquer before you can dash vault is the mental aspect. You have to have the confidence in your ability to clear the obstacle in the correct fashion. To do this, you want to break the dash vault into steps and go through them slowly.For example, run up to the obstacle and jump on top of it. Then, sit down and place your hands close to the edge. Once in this position, kick your legs forward. Do this over and over until you feel comfortable with each step.
You can also start with a lazy vault and then try to straighten your legs out.

Plant your second foot.,
Initiate the back flip.,
Landing the flip.",How to Run up a Wall and Flip2," Just like the one-legged wall flip, it will be a lot easier to execute a two-step wall flip if you already know some basic acrobatic and gymnastic flips. A back handspring, a back tuck, and even a front tuck will all help you recognize the leg and arm movements needed to safely execute a wall flip. As always, when first practicing a wall flip, use some soft tumbling mats and a trained and qualified spotter to help keep you from injuring yourself as you flip., Run up to the wall a bit faster than you did for the one-legged wall flip.With a two-step wall flip, deciding which foot to start your steps with lies more with personal preference rather than a clear cut right or left step.For example, if you are a righty, your right foot will be your dominant foot. You may want to take your first step using your right foot so you can get a lot of height in your first jump up the wall.However, you may want to take your first step with your left foot, so your dominant foot can push off the wall and provide better control in your flip.It all depends on what’s more comfortable for you.


As you run to the wall, you should pump your arms like you’re sprinting, rather than swinging your arms from behind and up as you did in the one-legged wall flip.In order to figure out what will be most comfortable for you, practice running at the wall and using both your right and left foot as your first step.

, With the one-legged wall flip, incorporating your arm swing was a lot more important, since you needed that extra momentum for the quick flip off the wall. With the two step wall flip, your first step is going to give you the vertical height to perform your flip a bit slower, where you don’t need as much added height momentum from your arms. Jump off of your ground foot, and plant your other foot on the wall at about hip height.As you push up and off of your planted foot, fully extend your leg and keep your chest straight and vertical.Extending your leg is going to give you maximum height for your flip. Be sure to keep your upper body straight and as close to the wall as possible, until you can plant your other foot.

, Once your first planted foot is fully extended, reach up and plant your other foot onto the wall.Your second planted foot will be higher up on the wall because of your first step jump up and onto the wall.


At this point, no longer try to keep your upper body vertical, allow the extension and push of your second foot to push you away from the wall., As you push off the wall with your second planted foot, begin to lean backward, and push off and away from the wall with your foot.Then, drive and swing your first step knee up, toward your chest to initiate the rotation to your flip.


Bring your other leg’s knee up, to follow your swung first step knee and throw yourself further into the flip.

, Because you have the added height, you don’t need to completely tuck your knees and keep your body in a tight ball. If fact, if you rotate too quickly (by tucking your knees in tightly), you may over rotate and end up landing on your back.If you already have your basic back flips down, you can rely on those landing techniques to land this wall flip.Experiment with the speed that you open up and lay out in order to get a clean landing.

Dress properly.,
Stretch.,
Find a suitable place to practice your balancing.,
Improve your strength.,
Practice walking up and down a low, flat narrow surface to begin with, over grass or another soft surface.,
Proceed to something harder to balance on once you're confident on the lower items.,
Try walking forwards and backwards.,
Close your eyes on the higher rail.,
Turn and balance on the balls of your feet.,
Keep practicing.",How to Improve Your Parkour Balancing Skills," Wear running shoes, trainers or other supple, gripping shoes suitable for parkour. Wear loose, comfortable clothing and nothing too tight. And don't overdress, in case you get too hot.;
, Before you train in any part of parkour, ensure that your muscles have been properly warmed up through stretching.


Some people also like to spend time clearing their mind of concerns and worries, so that they can fully focus on the parkour training. Perhaps a short meditation, a mantra, a positive visualization, etc.

, As a beginner, choose a place that isn't too high from the ground, where a fall is only a matter of a few inches or centimeters. The practice of balancing doesn't need height to begin with, just find suitable places that can enable balancing. Some suggestions for getting started include:


Railing placed at a low level is ideal, such as railing in gardens or used as traffic or parking barriers
Slim poles or pipes that can take your weight
The gutter at the edge of the sidewalk
Other low items you can walk on and balance.

, Balance is a lot about strength as well as balancing and this can be improved with gym or exercise workouts, even before you train in parkour. Find a gym or a fitness studio, or use your own equipment. Use apparatus that increases your ability to balance. One really good exercise is to stand on a half dome ball. These are exercise/gym balls cut in half and placed on a base. They often have cords attached to the sides for arm strengthening training:


Practice standing on this with your arms out to the sides. How long can you go?
Now switch it up and do squats without losing your balance. How many can you do?
Now shut your eyes and see how long you can stay there. You'll find it gets much harder as your sight is one aspect of good balance. Keep practicing remaining on the half ball with your eyes closed as long as possible. In the process, you will be strengthening your ankle region, which will greatly improve your sense of balance.

, The flat surface will give you the safety of keeping your feet flat but the narrowness should be enough to cause you to have to balance. For example, a narrow street gutter can be ideal because you have to place one foot in front of the other to stay on it. Each time you practice, make the distance you manage it longer and longer. Even though there isn't far to fall, the mental discipline in telling yourself that you are doing fine is a big part of this; the moment you start to tell yourself ""I'm going to fall"", you will, so use this easy training time to overcome these thoughts as well.


Use thin small garden walls to walk on. Just be sure the wall owner doesn't mind, and don't fall on their prize roses!
A think wooden rail, tree logs, or 2 by 4s in the backyard work fine too. Use whatever you have around the house and yard.
Check out the local playground. There is often a balancing bar or low balancing play equipment you can use. Just don't push away the kids; go after they've finished playing for the day.

, Look for a rounded rail. Rounded rails are great because you can't naturally stand on them without falling off and you have to use your sense of balance to remain on it.


If the rail is higher and over concrete, be sure that you're ready for this step. Have a spotter nearby to catch you in case, or to help you out if you do get into difficulties. And always wear gripping shoes!

, You need to feel comfortable balancing in any direction and the rhythm will change depending on the direction in which you're walking.

, Once you're feeling confident enough, try walking with closed eyes. Have your spotter walk alongside you in case you misstep or suddenly need support. With enough practice though, you'll soon get the hang of this.

, Do squats while in this position on the railing. It's a tough one to do but will increase both your strength and balance intensely.


This is a great muscle improving workout!

, With regular, consistent balancing practice, your confidence will grow, as will your strength. Don't neglect the related but different balancing exercises in the gym or at home; keep doing these to help keep your balancing skills sharp.

The first set has balls 1-5, the second set has balls 6-10, and the third set has balls 11-15.
The object of Cutthroat billiards is to pocket all of your opponent's balls and be the only player with balls from your group remaining on the table.;
, The shooting order is determined by lagging. One at a time, each player should take turns shooting the cue ball towards the foot cushion of the table. The balls will bounce back toward the head end of the table. Whichever player's ball ends up closest to the head end of the table has won the lag.


The player who is third in the shooting order will rack the balls, while the first shooting player will break them., Calling shots means naming the ball and the pocket you intend to shoot the ball in. In games where you have decided to call shots, you must name the ball and pocket accurately for each shot, or it will not count., A legal shot requires that the cue ball is used to contact the numbered balls. On all shots, players must cause the cue ball to contact an object ball. Any legally pocketed ball allows the shooter to continue at the table until they fail to pocket a numbered ball. Other fouls including scratching, hitting the balls of the table, and pocketing your own balls.


If player pockets their opponents’ ball on an illegal shot, the shot doesn't count. If the player pockets his own ball on an illegal shot, the ball remains pocketed and their turn ends.
Numbered balls that are hit off the table are considered foul, and the penalty for fouls is followed. The next player accepts the cue ball in the current position.
If the cue ball is scratched or jumped off the table, the incoming player gets the cue ball and can place it anywhere behind the head string.

, Whenever a player commits a foul, their turn ends. One ball from each of the opponents’ groups of balls that has been pocketed is brought back into play. This allows players who were eliminated to be brought back into the game at any time until the game is over. If a player’s group has no pocketed balls at the time of a foul, then the penalty has no effect on that group or player., Cutthroat is played on a standard pool table with a cue ball along with a standard set of pool balls (1-15), a standard triangle, a cue (pool stick) for each player participating (players may share cues as well), a cue bridge (for those hard to reach shots), and a cue chalk for chalking the tips of the cues., A standard triangle rack is used in Cutthroat billiards. The three corners of the rack should be filled with one ball from each group. Specifically, the 1 ball should be in the front corner, and the 6 and 11 balls should be placed on the two corners.


The rest of the balls don't have specific spots, but should be spread out amongst the triangle rack. This will ensure the best possible break., As previously mentioned, you should have determined which player will be breaking by performing a lag. If the starting player fails to make a legal break, the next player can accept the table’s position and shoot, or can ask for a re-rack and new break of the balls.


Any balls pocketed on a legal break remain pocketed.
An illegal break includes failing to break the rack of balls correctly or shooting the cue ball off of the table., Players take turns trying to pocket balls until they get a ball in a pocket. If the first shooter's break is successful, they will get the first shot to claim a set of balls: numbers 1-5, 6-10, or 11-15. The next player to shoot a ball in the pocket gets their choice of the remaining two sets of balls, and the third player gets whichever set is left.


The objective is to shoot your opponents' balls into the pockets, so choose the sets that have the most balls left on the table. Unfortunately the third shooter won't have much of a choice., After a successful break, each player will shoot their turn. A turn is over once a player makes no shot, or makes an illegal move. Illegal moves include scratches (shooting the cue ball in a pocket), moving a ball with your hands or your cue, and shooting the cue ball off the pool table., A winner is declared when they are the only player with balls left on the table. When a player has no balls on the table, they are considered ""out"" and their turn is skipped in the rotation of taking shots.


When the game is over, the winner becomes the breaker, the second to last player standing becomes the second player of the next game, and the player who lost first racks for the next game. This results in a shuffling of which player gets which set of balls from one game to the next."

You'll need your standard billiards table -- 4 feet (1.2 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m), 4 1⁄2 feet (1.4 m) by 9 feet (2.7 m), 5 feet (1.5 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m), or 6 feet (1.8 m) by 12 feet (3.7 m) without pockets.This ""without"" pockets thing is pretty important. You could play on a pool table (pocket billiards), but you'll soon find that the pockets get in the way and could potentially ruin the game. Here's everything you need to know (and some things you may not) when it comes to the table:


Those diamonds are for you to use! If you know your geometry, you can use them to aim your shot. We'll cover that in the next section (strategy).
The rail by where the first player breaks is called the short, or head, rail. The opposite rail is called the foot rail, and the long rails are called the side rails.
The area behind which you break, behind the ""head string,"" is called the ""kitchen.""
The pros play on heated billiards tables. The heat gets the balls to roll more smoothly.
It's green so you can look at it for long periods of time. Apparently humans can handle green better than any other color.;
, That's where you each line up your ball near the baulk cushion (the short end of the table where you break from), hit the ball, and see who can return it closest to the Baulk cushion as the ball slows to a stop. The game hasn't even started yet and it takes skill!


If you hit the other player's ball, you forfeit your chance of calling who starts. If you do win the lag, it's generally accepted that you go second. The player who breaks generally wastes their turn setting up the balls, not taking a strategic shot.

, You'll each need a cue stick, for starters (you had these for the lag, right?). Billiards cues are actually shorter and lighter than their pool counterparts, with a shorter ferrule (the white part near the end) and a thicker butt.Then you'll need three balls -- one white cue ball (heretofore called ""white""), one white cue ball with a black spot on it (""spot""), and one object ball, typically red. Sometimes a yellow ball is used in place of the spot.


The person who wins the lag calls which ball they'd like to be theirs (cue ball), the white or the spot. It's just a matter of personal preference. The object ball (red) is then placed at the foot spot.That's where the point of the triangle would be in pool, by the way. The opponent's cue ball is placed at the head spot, where you normally break from in pool as well. The starting player's cue is then placed on the head string (in line with the head spot), at least 6 inches (15 cm) from their opponent's cue.

So, obviously, when your ball is in line with your opponent's, it's very hard to hit both balls on the table. Hence why if you win the lag, you opt to go second.



, As with any game that's centuries old, there are variations in play. Some make it easy, some make it hard, and some make it faster or slower. How much time do you have on your hands? And how much skill?


For starters, every type of carom billiards involves getting a point by striking both balls on the table. It's how you do that that changes:

In straight-rail billiards, as long as you hit both balls, you get a point. This is easiest.
In one-cushion billiards, you must hit one cushion (one side of the table) before the second ball is displaced.In three-cushion billiards, you must hit three cushions before the balls roll to a stop.
Balkline billiards removes the one flaw in this game. If you manage to get both balls into a corner, you could, presumably, hit them off of each other over and over and over. Balkline billiards stipulates that you cannot receive points from a shot where the balls are in the same area (often the table is divided into 8 sections) of the table.


Once you determine how you get points, decide at what point you'd like to stop. In one-cushion, that number is generally 8.But three-cushion is so hard, you'll have better luck with 2!

, Move your arm smoothly back, then forward in a pendulum motion. The rest of your body should remain still as you stroke through the cue ball, letting the cue come to rest naturally. There you have it -- all you gotta do is hit both balls to receive a point -- technically, each turn is referred to as a ""cannon."" But here are some more specifics:The player who goes first must hit the red ball (it'd be weird to hit the other, anyway)
If you score a point, continue shooting
Playing ""slop"" (accidentally getting a point) is generally regarded as illegal
Always keep one foot on the floor at all times
""Jumping"" the ball is a foul, as is hitting a ball when it's still in motion

, You can do this while taking your practice strokes. Line up your cue stick with where you would hit the ball if you could hit it directly. Then aim for that spot.


Most often, you'll want to hit the cue ball squarely in the center. Sometimes, you may want to hit the ball to one side or another to impart sidespin, or ""English,"" to it to make the ball travel to one side. Occasionally, you may want to hit the cue ball below center to cause it to climb over a ball you don't want to move and strike a ball you do want to move.

, Your shooting hand should grip the butt of the cue stick in a loose, relaxed manner, with your thumb as a support and your index, middle, and ring fingers doing the gripping. Your wrist should point straight down to prevent it from moving sideways when you take your shot.


Your shooting hand should generally grip the cue stick about 6 inches (15 cm) to the rear of the stick's balance point. If you're short, you may want to move your hand forward of this point; if you're tall, you may want to move it further back.

, This prevents the cue stick from moving sideways when you shoot. There are 3 main grips: the closed, the open, and the rail bridge.


In a closed bridge, you wrap your index fingers around the cue and use your other fingers to steady your hand. This allows for more control over the stick, particularly with a forceful forward stroke.

, The cue will slide through and you will use your other fingers to keep the cue from moving sideways. The open bridge is better for softer shots and is preferred by players who have trouble making a closed bridge. A variation of the open bridge, is the elevated bridge, in which you raise your hand to lift the cue over an obstructing ball when striking the cue.


Use the rail bridge when the cue ball is too close to the rail for you to slip your hand behind it. Lay your cue stick over the rail and keep its tip steady with your off hand.

, Line yourself up with the cue ball and the ball you want to hit. The foot corresponding to your shooting hand (right foot if you're right-handed, left foot if you're left-handed) should be touching this line at a 45-degree angle. Your other foot should be a comfortable distance away from it and forward of the foot matching your shooting hand.

, This depends on 3 things: your height, your reach, and the location of the cue ball. The further away the cue ball is from your side of the table, the longer you'll have to stretch.


Most billiards games require you to keep at least 1 foot (0.3 m) on the floor when shooting. If you can't do so comfortably, you may either need to take a different shot or use a mechanical bridge to rest the tip of your cue stick in when you shoot.

, Your chin should be rest slightly over the table so that you're sighting down the cue stick as close to horizontal as comfortable. If you're tall, you'll need to bend your forward knee or both knees to get into position. You'll also need to bend forward at the hips.


Either the center of your head or your dominant eye should line up with the center of the cue stick without tilting. Some professional pool players do tilt their heads, however.
Most pocket billiards players put their heads 1 to 6 inches (2.5 to 15 cm) above the cue stick, while snooker players have their heads touching or almost touching the cue. The closer you bring your head, the greater your accuracy, but at a loss of range for the back and forward stroke.

, This depends all on where the balls lie on the table. In carom billiards games that allow it, you want to take shots that gather the balls together so you can score repeatedly by bouncing them off one another (in other words, not Balkline). Take a look at the angles and how it all lines up. Take into account the cushions, if you need to, too!


Sometimes, your best shot isn't a scoring shot (offensive shot) but to shoot the cue ball to a place where your opponent has difficulty making a scoring shot (that is, a defensive shot).
Take a few practice strokes if you need them. This will limber up your arm before the actual shot.

, Yep, math. But once you get it down, it's fairly simple. Each diamond has a number. You take the number of the diamond the cue would hit initially (called the cue position) and then subtract the natural angle (the number of the diamond on the short rail). This leaves you with a number -- the number of the diamond you should be aiming for!

, Yep, it's a thing. This is where players aim to complete 76 set-up variations, all of various levels of difficulty. So when you've got the game down, set yourself (and your friend) up some trick shots. Who can complete the most difficult ones?


If one-cushion billiards is doable, try moving to two. Three is near impossible, even for the pros! If you can handle two, you should start playing for money!

, How the cue ball strikes another ball can determine the direction the other ball travels. This effect is called ""throw"" and can be caused either by the angle at which the cue ball strikes the other ball, how much English was imparted to the cue ball, or both. Billiards players who've practiced and studied the effects of their shots make use of this when they play pool.


Take some time to experiment! The more you see how many options you have, the better you'll get and the more fun the game will be. Take your carom billiards skill and start playing pool, 9-ball, 8-ball or even Snooker!

Determine play order.,
Play the game.",How to Play Bumper Pool1," The game is played with 2 players. There are 2 pockets on opposing sides of the bumper pool table. Each player shoots at the pocket opposite his staring position on the table.;
, Each player gets 5 balls. One set of balls is white and the other set of balls is red. There are rows of 5 starting spots on the table. Each player places her balls on the spots on her own side of the table.


Note that 1 red ball has a white dot on it and 1 white ball has a red dot on it. These spotted balls are to be placed on the middle starting spot of each player's respective starting rows.







, At an agreed upon count, the players simultaneously strike their spotted balls and attempt to get them into the object pocket on the other side of the table. The presence of bumpers in a cluster in the middle of the table makes a straight shot impossible, so the players must bank their balls off of the side rails of the table. To avoid having the first shots interfere with each other, both players must make their opening shots towards the table rail to the players' right.

, The player that placed his ball closer to the object pocket will shoot first. If both players pocketed the opening shot, they must perform another opening shot using the leftmost ball in the starting line up of balls.

, Each player continues to shoot for as long as he can continue to pocket balls. Failure to pocket a ball on a shot passes play over to the other player.


Pocket balls in the proper order. The spotted ball must be pocketed first. After pocketing the spotted ball, the other 4 balls may be pocketed in any order.






Determine a winner. When a player has pocketed her last ball, that player wins the game.

Pocket the spotted ball first.,
Keep the balls on the table.,
Avoid knocking you opponent's balls off of the table.,
Pocket your own balls rather than the opponents balls.,
Pocket your balls in your own target pocket.",How to Play Bumper Pool2," Playing any of the other balls before the spotted ball has been pocketed must be corrected by replacing all balls as they were before the shot. Pocketing any of the other balls before the spotted ball allows the opponent to choose any 2 of his own balls and pocket them by hand into his object pocket. Play passes to the other player.

, If you knock a ball off of the table, replace it in the dead center of the table, where it will be surrounded by bumpers. Play passes to the other player.

, If you knock an opponent's ball off of the table, replace it in the position it was before the shot and place 1 of your own balls in the dead center of the table. Play passes to your opponent.

, If a player pockets an opponent's ball, it will count as a ball pocketed by the opponent.

, If a player pockets a ball in the object pocket of the opponent, the opponent chooses 2 of her own balls and pockets them by hand into her own object pocket. If a player scores the last ball into the object pocket of the opponent, the player loses the game.

Sink your 8-ball without hitting another ball.",How to Play Pool in a Bar or Tavern," Unless people state otherwise, they’ll follow basic pool rules. You should know these basic pool rules before you play in a bar or pub – or anywhere else for that matter. They are:


Call your shot.
The shot after the break is the one that determines color ownership – even if a ball went in during the break.
For a shot to count, you’ve got to hit your color first. If you hit another player’s ball, the shot doesn’t count.
If you hit the 8-ball, it’s an illegal shot (unless it’s the final 8-ball shot).;
, Different regions and countries often have rule variations. It is good practice to be aware of regional rule variations before you even agree to play a game. That way, nothing will be a surprise to you.


Talk to people in the bar about the rules before you volunteer.
Lookup local rules on the internet before you go to a bar.
See if there are any rules posted in the bar or pub that you’re interested in playing in., This is important, as bar pool is a relatively casual way of playing pool that is also taken seriously by the players.

Don’t go into a bar or pub thinking you’re going to play to the letter of official tournament rules.
Most people who play pool in bars play by relatively standard rules, but there is also a wide variation of how rules are interpreted or followed.
Talk to whoever it is your playing against to understand what sort of rules they expect the game to follow., Often times, the person who won the last game essentially “owns” the table. This means a number of things that you should understand and respect before playing with that person.


The winner will play in the next game.
The winner will often go first or decide if they’re going first or not in the next game.
The winner can declare special or custom rules for the next game., Most times in a bar, there will be a lot of people waiting to play. Make sure you don’t step in ahead of someone. Stepping in ahead of someone will not only be considered rude, but it could get you into a fight.

Ask whoever’s playing if anyone is next.
Look for a chalkboard to see if there is a list of people waiting to play.
Be polite and patient if there are other people waiting to play., Any “house rules” or “local rules” should be stated and agreed upon before the game begins. If there are any “house rules,” you’ll probably be notified of those rules relatively quickly when you jump in to play.


Approach the person who owns the table and ask ""Hey, I'd love to play. Are there any custom rules I should know about?""
If they say yeah, make sure you understand all of the rules.
If you don't understand, ask them to explain the rule.
Write them down if you don't think you'll remember the rules.

, In most bars, balls often do not have to be racked the way they are in tournaments. Many people will just randomly rack the balls. However, there are a number of things you do need to do when racking balls in a bar or pub:


Don’t worry about any particular order or color-based racking.
The only requirement is that the 8 ball be the front-most of the center three balls.
Most people put the 1 in front.
It is also good to place a stripe in one of the rear corners., Call your exact shot, including which balls are touched by the target ball on the way to the pocket. This is a very important element of the game, and if you can call your shot, you should. However, many players in bar are forgiving, and shot calling might be optional. If it is not optional, remember:


If you make the ball but not exactly how you called it, you lose the rest of your turn, but the ball stays in (hey, it's a bar table). Touching a rail on the way to a pocket is incidental and not a foul.
A badly sunk ball is called ""slop.""
It is not necessary to call an obvious straight-in kind of shot.
Calling your exact shot is very important in a bar or pub. Being able to call shots is also what separates good players from not-so-good players., After you break the racked balls, you can select your color . Whoever breaks the balls selects their color first. The second player is then assigned the other color.


The table is typically considered open after the break even if a ball was sunk on the break, so the shooter can select either color on his second shot.
If you fail to sink another ball, the table is still open, until one of the players makes a fair called shot.
Before a ball has been sunk that determines your color (on the first shot or two) you can legally hit any combination (except using the 8 ball)., After your color (solids or stripes) has been determined, you must hit your color first on every shot except for the 8-ball shot. An opponent's ball may be in the center of a three-ball combination. Often times, if you hit your opponent’s color first, the shot is considered illegal and you will lose your turn.

, The 8-ball can never be hit first (except when trying to sink it, of course). It cannot be hit first by the cue ball in a combination, carom, etc. In fact, the 8-ball should never be used in any manner (until it is the target ball on your final shot).


Rules for the use of 8-ball in a legal combination, carom, shot vary from bar to bar, locale to locale.
Most times it is one of the pre-game rules agreed upon by the players or in the set rules of play depending on the venue.
The 8-ball is never neutral.

, A carom is when the cue ball hits two other balls successively. You can only carom or kiss the cue ball off of your color ball. After the cue hits your target ball, the target ball can carom off of an opponent's ball.

, A scratch is when the cue ball goes into a pocket. If you scratch, you lose your turn. Don’t scratch, because your opponent will get a leg up on you. Make sure that you do your best to make sure only your color balls go into the pocket., The cue ball is placed behind the head spot (head string across the table - diamond to diamond). The center of the target ball must be past the head string. This rule is standard in most all bars and taverns.

, Direct splits are when you shoot and contact two balls simultaneously with the cue ball. They are often illegal. Direct splits are always questionable when they involve the 8-ball or an opponent's object ball. Avoid direct splits if you can.


In official play of any kind it is never legal to hit your target ball after or at the exact instance as an opponent's ball, even if you call it first as a ""split"".
A direct split is also known as a ""mixed split.”
There is no such thing as a legal ""mixed split.” Local rules for this mixed ""split"" shot vary from bar to bar, locale to locale, etc.
Most times it is one of the pre-game rules agreed upon by the players or in the set rules of play depending on the venue., Your 8-ball shot should be a clean hit – which means you can’t hit the other player's ball. This is perhaps the most important shot of your game, so don’t mess it up. Also realize that depending on house rules, if your 8-ball shot is a scratch, you will lose the game.

Brace a set of dollies.,
Retrieve your dollies.",How to Move a Pool Table1," These wooden wheeled wonders make moving heavy objects a cinch. You'll want to wrap the edges of your dollies in carpet or fabric. This will prevent the legs of the pool table from being scratched., Distribute your dollies around each corner of your pool table to prepare each for being slid under its legs. Clear the area around the pool table so that there are no objects that might get caught in the wheels and make it difficult to slide the dollies into place.


When clearing objects from around/under your pool table, don't forget to remove any throw rugs, which can bunch and hamper the rolling of your dolly.

, You should be able to do this alone, but since pool tables are heavy, a friend can considerably lessen your effort. Tilt the pool table off the ground from one of the longer sides.Lift with your legs to prevent injury to your back.

, If you are doing this alone, snag the dolly with your foot and push it into place beneath the pool table. Be sure not to overexert yourself in this maneuver or lose your grip; dropping your pool table can damage it. If you are working with a friend, have him roll the wooden dolly into place.


Repeat this process for both legs of the end of the pool table that you are lifting.

, When you raise the other end of your pool table, you will be applying force to the pool table that might cause it to roll backwards on the dollies you have just placed. You'll want to prevent this by locking the wheels, or by placing an object to jam the wheels of your dollies, rendering each stationary.

, Double check that your dollies are within foot-reach or that your friend is ready to slide the dollies into place, then lift the other side of the pool table. Move the other two dollies beneath both legs of that end of your table.

, Unlock or unblock the two dollies. Now you should walk the path on which you plan on wheeling your pool table. Measure all doors that you'll have to pass through and check these measurements against the width of your pool table. Move carpets and other items that might bunch or otherwise jam the wheels of your dollies. A jammed wheel can jostle your table and do damage to it, you, a wall, or one of your possessions., You want to control the speed at which your table rolls. Due to the considerable weight of your pool table, if it gains too much speed it will be nearly impossible for you to stop. If you have a friend, each of you should push the pool table from opposite corners of the same side and, in a controlled fashion, move it through your home.


If you are doing this on your own, you'll want to take a more central position, probably at the end of the longways side, between the two corner pockets.
The weight of the pool table will make it difficult to turn corners. Take this into account when moving it through your home.

, You'll want to remove the dollies opposite your braced dollies first. Before you do anything, check the position and alignment of your pool table. Once you take the table off the dollies, it will again become difficult to move.

, Lift from the middle of the long side of your pool table and have your friend quickly pull the dollies free. Then you should carefully lower it to the ground. If you are doing this alone, you should be able to easily kick the dollies free, and then slowly, in a controlled fashion to prevent damage, lower your table.


Once one set are removed, you can unlock the wheels of the dollies at the opposite side and remove these in the same fashion.

In a friendly game, you can play with three or more teams. This is not recommended if some of you are much better at pool than others.;
, You can just flip a coin, but ""lagging"" is a more entertaining way to decide the first player. On an empty table, every player places a ball just behind the head string. Each player hits his ball at the same time. The goal is to have your ball touch the far end of the table, then bounce back as far as possible without touching the near end or the sides. Whoever gets closest gets to break (see below).Try again if two of the balls touch each other, or if no one manages to hit the end without touching another side.

, Pick out the nine balls numbered 1 through 9, and place them inside the rack. Arrange them in a diamond shape, with the 9-ball in the center and the 1-ball closest to the shooter. Place balls in the rest of the diamond at random.


The rack goes in the usual place, with the closest point on top of the foot spot.
If you can find a diamond-shaped 9-ball rack, use it. If you have to use a triangular 15-ball rack, just make the diamond shape as tightly packed as you can.

, Have the first player set down the white cue ball anywhere behind the head string. That player hits the cue ball at the 1-ball to break.


The break should pocket one ball, and/or send at least three balls to any rail (side).If neither of these happens, set up the rack again and let the next player break instead.

, Whenever you pocket a ball, you get to take another shot. Continue taking shots until you fail to pocket a ball, or you foul. When this happens, play passes to the next player.


This includes the break: if the person who broke pocketed a ball, they get to take another shot.
Just like 8-ball, you can only hit the cue ball, usually a white ball with no numbers.

, In 9-ball pool, whoever pockets the 9-ball wins the game. You can even win on the break this way! Of course, there are other rules that makes this goal harder than it sounds.

, Every time you take a shot, the cue ball must hit the lowest-numbered ball still on the table, before it hits any other balls. If it hits a different ball first, or if it doesn't hit any balls, the shot is a foul. (See below for more info on fouls.)


You can pocket any numbered ball without a penalty. For example, the cue ball can hit the 1-ball, then bounce off and knock the 7-ball into a pocket. This is a legal shot. You can even pocket the 9-ball this way to win the game.

, After hitting the lowest-numbered ball, at least one ball must hit a rail or enter a pocket. If this does not happen, the shot is a foul., If a player commits a foul, the next player picks up the cue ball and places it anywhere on the table before making her shot.As mentioned above, fouls include hitting the wrong ball first, or failing to drive any ball into a pocket or rail.

, Standard pool fouls also apply: knocking a ball off a table, pocketing the cue ball (""scratching""), touching a moving ball, or hitting the cue ball out of turn are all fouls. The next player gets to move the cue ball anywhere on the table.


If the 9-ball is knocked off or pocketed during a foul, ""spot"" it back to the foot spot, or as close behind the foot spot as possible.Other numbered balls that leave the table illegally stay out of play.
Accidentally touching a non-moving ball is not a foul, but the other players get to decide whether to leave it in the new position or move it back.

, Compared to other types of pool, 9-ball plays ends quickly. Typically, the players agree to play until one person or team has won a certain number of games. Try playing first to three games if you are new pool players, or first to seven if you are intermediate or advanced.

, The push out rule gives the players a little more control over the starting position following the break. This adds more strategy to competitive matches. In a friendly game involving beginner pool players, this rule is not necessary.

, The push out rule only applies on the first shot following a break. The player about to take the second shot can choose to announce a ""push out."" If he does not announce it, then play proceeds as usual.


If the shooter pocketed a ball on the break, he may announce a push out, since he's about to take another shot. If he did not pocket a ball, the next player gets the option to push out instead.

, On an announced push out shot, the shooter does not have to hit the lowest-numbered ball, and does not have to send a ball at a rail or pocket.If the push out pockets a 9-ball, ""spot"" it back to the foot spot. Any other numbered ball stays in the pocket.
Other foul rules still apply.

, After the push-out, the next player chooses whether to play or to pass the turn. She gets to make this decision even if the ""push out"" pocketed a ball. After this decision, play proceeds as usual.


If a foul occurred on the push out, follow the usual foul rules instead. The next player places the cue ball anywhere and takes a shot.

One player must pocket balls of the group numbered 1 through 7 (solid colors), while the other player has 9 through 15 (stripes). To win, you must be the player to pocket either group first, and then legally pocket the 8-ball., Look for a small dot or triangle in the lateral center of the felt, about a quarter of the way down the length of the table. This is where you will place the cue ball to begin the game. The line that runs through this point is called the ""head string."", Find the triangular pool rack and place the 1-15 balls inside. Arrange the rack at the opposite end of the table from the head spot, with one corner of the triangle facing the break. Make sure that the rack is laterally centered along the foot string. Then, when you are ready to play, remove the racking frame so that only the balls remain.


Place the point of the triangle three-quarters down the length of the table, at the ""foot spot"": the dot on the tabletop that corresponds to the head spot. If the ""head string"" marks the 1/4 point from the head of the table to the foot, then the ""foot string"" is an imaginary line that marks the distance 3/4 of the way from the head to the foot. The ""food spot"" is located at the exact midpoint of the foot string line.Set the 8-ball in the center of the triangle. Put the 1-ball at the point of the triangle, facing the break. Place a stripe ball in one back corner of the rack, and a solid ball in the other corner.

, Pool is rich with unique terminology that can be difficult for new players to understand. Reference the terms as you learn to play. If you aren't sure what something means, ask a veteran pool player to clarify.


Object balls: The striped and solid balls numbered 1-15. Every pool ball but the cue ball. The ""object balls"" are the balls that you are trying to knock into the pockets.
Pocket: The baskets along the rim of the pool table. There are six pockets: one in each corner, and one at the midpoint of each long side. ""Pocketing"" is the act of knocking one or more numbered ""object"" balls into a pocket.
Rail: The bank along the side of the pool tabletop.
Scratch: When a player accidentally knocks the cue ball into a pocket. If you scratch, remove one of your sunk balls from a pocket and place it back in the center of the table. Your opponent now has the chance to shoot from his or her chosen spot at the top of the table.
Open table: The table is ""open"" when the choice of groups (stripes or solids) has not yet been determined. When the table is open, it is legal to hit a solid first in order to make a stripe or solid.
Foul penalty: Opposing player gets the cue ball in hand. This means that the player can place the cue ball anywhere on the table to take his or her next shot.

, One player lines up the cue ball behind the head string and aims at the rack. Knock the cue ball into the triangle of balls with force and precision. To execute a legal break shot, the breaker must either pocket a ball, or drive at least four numbered balls to the rail. When the breaker fails to execute a proper break, it is a foul., If the breaking player scratches on his or her shot, then the game has only partially begun. In the case of a foul, the incoming player has two options: accept the table as is and take the next shot, or re-rack the balls for a redo of the opening break. The incoming player gets to choose whether to personally break or to allow the original breaker to try again.If a player scratches on a legal break shot:

All balls pocketed remain pocketed.
The shot is a foul, meaning that it is now the other player's turn to shoot.
The table is open, meaning that the first player to sink a ball without scratching chooses that ball type (stripes or solids) as his or her objective for the game.


If a player jumps a numbered ball off the table on the break shot, it is a foul. The incoming player has two options:

Accept the table in position. Take the next shot and continue the game.
Take the cue ball in hand behind the head string. Shoot or break again, as necessary.


If the 8-ball is pocketed on the break, then the breaker may ask for a re-rack, or have the 8-ball spotted and continue shooting. If the breaker scratches while pocketing the 8-ball on the break, the incoming player has the option of a re-rack or having the 8-ball spotted and begin shooting with ball in hand behind the head string.

, Before groups are chosen, the table is ""open."" The first player to sink a numbered ball effectively chooses to aim for that group of balls throughout the rest of the game. If you are the breaking player, for instance, and you sink the striped 13-ball, then you are ""stripes."" Look around for other striped balls that are easy to strike. Your goal is to pocket all of the striped balls (and then the 8-ball) before your opponent pockets all of the solid balls and the 8-ball.Make it clear who is who. If you make a stripe, call out, ""I'm stripes!"" If you make a solid, call out, ""I'm solids!""
If you are the first player to pocket a numbered ball, but you sink both a stripe and a solid at the same time: you have your pick between the two groups. Choose the group that looks the most immediately advantageous.

, If you are shooting on ""stripes,"" and you make the striped 12 ball, then it is still your turn. Try to pocket another striped ball. If you successfully pocket another striped ball on your next shot, then you can shoot again. As soon as you scratch or miss the pocket, however, it immediately becomes your opponent's turn.


There is no rule against combination shots, in which you sink two numbered balls from your group with one shot. However, the 8-ball can not be used as a first ball in the combination unless it is the shooter’s only remaining legal object ball on the table. Otherwise, it is a foul.

, If you are shooting ""stripes,"" then try to make all of the balls numbered 1-7 so that you can pocket the 8-ball. If you are shooting ""solids,"" then make all of the balls numbered 9-15. If you make your opponent's ball, then your turn ends in a scratch.

, In many official pool games, players must call each shot they take in order for that shot to be legal. This means: before each shot, announce which ball you are going to knock into which pocket. You might say, ""4-ball, corner pocket,"" and indicate with your pool cue to make it clear which pocket you mean.If you are playing a casual game of pool with friends, then there is no need to call your shots.

, You can only legally shoot at the 8-ball once you have made all of the other numbered balls in your group (stripes or solids). Make sure to call your pocket! Look over the table and decide which pocket will be the easiest place to sink the 8-ball. Then, announce where you are going to pocket the 8-ball before you shoot. If you are the first to legally pocket the 8-ball, then you win the game!For instance: say, ""8-ball, corner pocket,"" and indicate which corner pocket you mean.
If you call your shot, but you do not make the 8-ball into a pocket: it is now your opponent's turn to shoot. You have neither won nor lost unless you make the 8-ball or scratch while trying to make the 8-ball.

, A game of 8-ball pool ends when a player legally sinks the 8-ball after pocketing all of the numbered balls in his or her group. However, a player can also lose the game by committing certain infractions.


A player loses when he or she: pockets the 8-ball at any point after the break; pockets the 8-ball on the same stroke as the last of his/her group of balls; jumps the 8-ball off the table at any time after the break; pockets the 8-ball in a pocket other than the one he/she has called; or pockets the 8-ball when it is not the legal ""object ball.""

Depending on the design of your pool table, these could be attached to the table in various ways, though usually you'll find staples attaching each to the table. Lay on your back underneath the pocket and pry the staples out with a flathead screwdriver or staple puller.To prevent an errant stable falling into your eye, you do not lie directly under the pool table, and you might consider wearing some kind of eye protection.

, Again, the part holding the rails to your table depends on your table, but chances are good that bolts will be holding these in place. You can remove these bolts easily with a regular socket wrench.Slide each rail free. If the rails are attached in sections, you may need a helper to flip them over all at once and disconnect them.

, This is the most delicate part of the process, as a tear to your felt can ruin it completely. If the felt is held in place by staples, a staple puller may help prevent you from incurring damage to the felt.Glued felt can be removed by gently pulling it backwards, never upwards or forwards, taking care not to rip it.If you are planning to reuse the felt, fold it up to prevent wrinkles.

, There will likely be screws holding the slate of your pool table to its frame. These can be most effectively removed with a power drill that has been fitted with the right type of bit.In some cases beeswax is used on the screws to prevent damage. If this is the case, use a flathead screwdriver to scrape off the beeswax before unscrewing the slate.

, The rock that forms the level surface upon which you play pool must remain unblemished to protect the integrity of your future games. Slate usually comes either in a solid piece or three pieces.Lift the slate off the pool table legs and set it in your transport vehicle.


It's safe to stack the pieces of slate on top of each other, but be sure each are properly fastened and don't jostle against anything the might cause damage.
To make sure that your slate is undamaged, you should wrap it in a blanket, drop cloth, or some other covering.

, Now that the delicate parts of your pool table have been removed and stowed away, taking the legs off the frame shouldn't pose a problem. Likely, your trusty drill will come to your aid again, and with a proper bit, soon the legs will be off., You can set the frame on top of the slate in your vehicle. If you have a finished table with lacquered wood, you may want to wrap the finished surfaces with a drop-cloth or some kind of padding to protect against damage., Any remaining parts should be manageable at this point, and shouldn't require any further disassembly. Finish loading these parts into your transport vehicle and move your table to to the new location.

, You should take measurements so you can be sure your table will fit comfortably wherever you move it, but even more important, you'll want to clear the area in which you are setting up the pool table and the path to this room. Getting tripped up by a throw rug when you're carrying the slate is a good way to ruin a perfectly good pool table., You will want to take great care when assembling your pool table. Improper installation can leave it unlevel, which will affect your game. Starting with your frame and legs, begin reassembling your table.


For specific issues dealing with leveling, warping, and cracked or damaged slate, please see the section on troubleshooting.

, The slate is one of the most difficult and delicate pieces in your pool table due to its weight. Any damage done to the slate can ruin your pool table. Single pieces of slate will install more easily since you'll only have to slide it into place. For pool tables with three-piece slate parts, move each piece to your mostly assembled table, setting each atop it with space between the pieces. Then:


Check to see the pieces haven't been damaged and fit together neatly. Are the dowel pins that connect the pieces bent or warped? If so, you may have to make a trip to the hardware store to buy a few new dowels.
Slide each of the three slate pieces together with the proper connectors between and slot the assembled slate into its place on the table.
Take care to not get your hands caught between pieces of slate. This can cause serious injury to hands and fingers.

Know how to handle antique rails.",How to Move a Pool Table3," Especially with older pool tables where the frame may be difficult to deconstruct, over the course of your move, you may have caused the configuration of the frame to shift. This could create difficulty when inserting the slate.


Use a level to check that the frame is still properly shaped. You may also want to use a carpenter's square to check the corner angles of your table., Older tables, or tables that have sat in one location for a long time, may have experienced warping, or may have conformed to the natural contours of the home in which it lived. This might mean that you need an additional piece, separate from the parts of your pool table, to balance it and negate any rocking you may notice once the table is moved.


When choosing a piece to balance a rocking pool table, you need to choose a material that won't compress under the weight of it. Scrap steel or a sturdy tile might do the trick., Buildings frequently have a slight pitch to them, and pool tables, to combat these potential angles, will often have adjustable feet. After you've taken care of the frame configuration and any major imbalances, you can move on to leveling the table. Have a friend hold the level atop a flat part of the frame and:


Take the level reading.
If the table isn't level, lift the end that needs adjusting.
Have a friend adjust the leg in the appropriate direction.
Set the pool table down.
Check the level reading again and repeat if necessary.

, Significant damage to the slate of your pool table is likely to require a professional repair or even replacement, but small chips or cracks might be within your ability to mend. For small cracks or chips, mix some Plaster of Paris and apply it to the area, while larger cracks can be patched with automotive body filler.After your patch has hardened, you'll need to sand your patch level.

, There is little you can do to your table if the entire frame has warped to the point that the slate now sits in its mounting on an angle. The slate, on the other hand, can be adjusted. After fitting the slate together and fixing any damage, you can cut thin wedges of wood, called shims, and use these to level your slate., Some older pool tables will use special bolts to connect the rails to the narrow edge of the slate. To remove and attach the rails of an antique pool table, a T-bolt wrench will make the process much easier."

Use a mechanical bridge.",How to Hold a Pool Cue," Place one hand at the point on the stick close to the rear where it is balanced. There will usually be tape there. Place your hand approximately 4 to 5 inches (10.2 to 12.7 cm) back. Ideally, your back hand should be at a 90-degree angle with your cue.Most beginners start off by gripping the cue too tightly. Your grip should be relaxed and yet controlled.
Your body should be in line with the cue ball. This will help you aim your shot correctly.
Hold the stick using your thumb and index finger and add your middle finger if you'd like a bit more power.;
, Once you grip the cue with your dominant hand and find your shot, you should lower your body toward the table, so you're staring down the line of the cue ball. You won't be able to make your shot if you're stiff and upright.Keep your legs relaxed, slightly bent and at least a few inches apart.

, Place your other hand about 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) away from the cue ball down on the table. The closer you are to the ball, the more precision you'll have with your shot. Once your hand is down, you will make a bridge, or a cradle with your hand that will allow you to balance the cue on your hand and hit your shots. Though certain bridges work better in certain situations, it's best to be familiar with the most common bridge, the open bridge, first:For the open bridge, a bridge is formed by placing your hand on the table and spreading your fingers apart.
Slide the cue between your index and middle finger knuckles or in the ""V"" that is formed between your thumb and index finger.
The pool cue is supported by the ""V"" between the index finger and thumb.
You can adjust the height of the cue tip by raising or lowering the arch of the hand.
This allows the cue to slide as you aim it at the ball.

, Lean forward and mentally place the cue on the spot on the cue ball that you want to hit. Techniques for hitting the cue ball in the right spot for specific shots can be perfected later. Ideally, you should hit that cue ball in its center, or on the ""sweet spot"" of the ball, so it goes where it needs to go.


Make sure you can see a direct line between the cue ball and the object ball (the ball you're aiming for).

, Slide the cue forward while aiming steadily. If you feel uncertain about the shot, then you can gently move the cue back and forth on your bridge to feel more steady and balanced before you take your shot instead of trying to take your shot right away. Remember that you want to stroke the ball, not poke it. Follow through with your shot by continuing your motion slightly after taking the shot.








Keep your body low to the table until you've finished taking the shot.
Grip the pool cue in a loose and relaxed manner. Don't tighten up during the shot. If the grip is too tight, the cue may jerk and change the direction of your shot.
Hold the pool cue with your hand gripping it from the outside and use your thumb on the inside as support. This provides you with better control. Use your thumb, index and second finger of the other hand to hold the cue in place.

, The closed bridge is a more advanced technique that can be used for more accented shots. Needless to say, it will also help you look more like a pro, but it's important to do it right. Here's what you need to do:









Place your front hand on the table while making a fist.
Spread your pinkie, ring, and middle finger while leaving your index finger tucked.
Lift your index finger and slide the thumb underneath it.
Slide your index finger over your thumb to create a loop.
Place your cue through the loop, while keeping the tip of your thumb pressed against the tip of your index finger.

, This bridge can be helpful when you don't have enough room to make a traditional bridge because the ball is too close to the end of the table. Here's how you do it:









Place your hand on the rail itself.
Lift your index finger over your thumb and place it on the other side of the cue stick, so that your thumb is on one side of the stick and your index finger is on the other.
Use the rail for bottom stability. Take your shot.

, If the ball is so close to the rail that even the traditional rail bridge is not possible, then you can use a different version of the rail bridge to make your shots. Here is what you can do:









Place your palm against the edge of the rail.
Place your index finger flat over the rail, guiding the cue on one side.
Place the tip of your thumb on the other side to guide the cue on the other side.
This time, your thumb and index fingers will be in their normal positions, with the cue in the middle.
Take your shot, using the rail for bottom support.

, This can help you hit that cue ball when it is being nearly blocked by another ball. Here is all you have to do to hit this shot:









Plant your index finger down on the table, almost perpendicular to it.
Plant down your pinkie finger while tucking your middle and ring fingers under, forming a tripod.
Lift your thumb upwards, forming a v-channel between your thumb and index finger in the air.
Place the cue between your thumb and index finger and take your shot.

, The mechanical bridge is perfect for shots where the ball is too far out of reach; they can be much more useful than trying to overreach and missing that shot because you're off-kilter. Don't be discouraged by the affectionate alternative names, ""crutch"" or ""granny stick""—there's absolutely nothing shameful about using a mechanical bridge! Here's how you use it:


Place the bridge flat on the table, behind the cue ball.
Place the cue in the groove that will give you the best shot.
Hold the butt cap of the stick with your thumb, index, and middle finger.
Place your head down into the line of the shot and take your shot.

Quit while you're ahead.",How to Level a Pool Table," If you've noticed your billiard balls making strange curves, measure your pool table for level. The best way to do this is with a basic carpenter's level. Analog or digital levels both work fine.


Analog carpenter levels usually have bubbles that will orient between two lines when the surface is level, and will skew to one side when the surface is crooked. These are great for telling not only whether or not your table is crooked, but by how much, and to what direction.
If you don't have one, there are free or very cheap apps you can get on most smart phones with quite accurate level-functions. Use one of these instead, and just lay your phone on the surface you want to check for level.;
, Set the carpenter's level in the middle of the pool table, oriented long-ways. If the pool table is balanced from end to end, the bubbles in the carpenter's level will be situated between the two lines in the middle of the glass tubes.If the bubbles in the glass tubes are above or below the middle lines, you will need to raise or lower one of the shorter ends of the pool table.

, Turn the level the opposite direction in the middle as well, perpendicular to the long sides of the rectangle and even with the shorter sides. This will help you measure the side-to-side level of the table.


Take a measurement. If the bubbles are above or below, you'll also need to adjust the legs in that direction to make the table flat.

, Most of the time, the problem with pool tables is that one leg, or multiple legs, is lower than the other three legs on the table. To find it, put the level close to the edge of each of the four sides of the pool table to get a more accurate reading.


Move to each side and each corner of the pool table, checking with the level for the severity of the lean. The corner with the most lean is the one you're looking for.
In some cases, you'll get weird readings because the floor of the house may be less than level. If that's the case, you can still make adjustments in the same basic way, it'll just take a little more troubleshooting to get it right.

, Roll the cue ball over a section of the table, as straight as possible. Move your eye even with the plane of the table, to look along the path of the ball. See whether the ball rolls off course towards one particular side of the table, or if it moves true.


Repeat the process on a few sections of the table. Adjust the table if the ball is rolling off course towards a particular side, if necessary.
This method requires that you move the ball extremely straight, which is somewhat difficult and less accurate than a level. If you try this, check your results against a carpenter level to be sure.

, Another way of checking for level that doesn't involve a level is to set a piece of glass in the middle of the pool table, and let a marble roll across it.


Place a marble on the middle of the piece of glass. The ball should stay in place if the pool table is level. Adjust the table if the ball rolls off of the glass towards a particular area of the table.Repeat the process on every side of the table. Place the glass and marble 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) from every pocket on the pool table.

, The level should dip, or the ball should move in the same direction at both corners on the same side. If the level dips in one more than the other, that's the corner you need to adjust.


If the level doesn't, turn it the other way and check for level on the perpendicular side. #*When you locate the lowest corner, put the 8-ball in that pocket, so you'll be able to remember which one it is.

, Most pool tables are made to be adjustable, so you can make them level, regardless of what surface they're on. Some pool tables may have metal plates, which can be added or removed to raise or lower the sides. Other pool tables have adjustable legs, with feet that can be screwed clockwise or counterclockwise, to raise or lower that side. Your owner's manual will provide specific information about your pool table.


If you don't have the manual, just look at the legs to see how they're put together, and whether or not they have adjustable components. If your pool table does not, you can still use shims and other tiny adjustments to level the table.
If the table features screw-in feet or legs, they'll usually be raised by turning them to the right and lowered by turning them to the left. But always defer to the owner manual to be sure.

, Sometimes, the bolts and screws used to assemble a pool table can loosen slightly over time, resulting in the table becoming off-level. If you tighten up all the attachment screws, you can sometimes level out the table without even adjusting the height.


Pool tables involve any number of different screws and screwdrivers to tighten. Look at the screws themselves to figure out what you need, or consult the owner's manual.

, If your pool table is adjustable, raise the lowest corner of the pool table by one degree, the least it can be adjusted. Leave the carpenter's level on the pool table, and check for the change.


If that was too much, and the table has been unleveled in the wrong direction, lower it back to where it was and use shims to make smaller adjustments. More on this in the next section.

, Sometimes, you'll have to make lots of little tweaks on different sides to get the top of the table completely level. It's partially a trial-and-error process, so don't get discouraged. Leave the level on the top of the table and check for level after every adjustment.


You can also leave the over adjusted leg as it is, and use shims on the over levels, if you'd rather. It's partially a trial-and-error process.

, Shims are small, tapered shards of wood that you can use to fill gaps and adjust the height of things like pool tables. They're commonly sold in the carpentry sections of any hardware or home goods store, usually in packages with variable sizes.


You can trim the shims to fit underneath the feet of the table if necessary, to make sure that they don't show. If the feet are big enough, though, you may not need to worry about it.

, Have one or more assistants lift the corner of the table that needs to be raised. Carefully, place a shim underneath the leg, lowering the foot onto it gently.


Use the carpenter's level to check the balance of the pool table. See how the shim has affected the level of the top.
Continue to add shims underneath the legs until the pool table is balanced. Move to other corners if necessary, to make other adjustments.

, Pool tables don't need to be absolutely flat for them to work well enough to play on. If you can get it close enough, but not totally perfect, don't keep adding and removing the same shim over and over.


Roll a couple balls to see how true they move. If it looks good to you, go with it.
Do the marble-and-glass test again. If it sits still, you've got a playable table.

Set aside some time for tournament play.,
Know 9 ball game rules and develop a strategy for playing and winning in any way.,
Have two cues, one for breaking and the other for shooting.,
Be focused.,
When breaking a rack and deciding to do a power break, follow these pointers:


Accuracy comes first and power comes after.,
Make your shots with your dominant hand.,
Practice by working on your weak areas.,
For a small percentage of your practice time, play games.,
Learn from observing other players and professionals on TV.",How to Play and Win in 9 Ball Tournaments," In double elimination play with 30 players, expect the tournament to be about three hours to completion. Ask the billiards hall people on how long the tournament will be, the entry fee and cash prize payout. In double elimination, if you lose twice you are eliminated but can still win despite losing once.;
, You can win by sinking the nine ball and also if your opponent is disqualified - practice both ways. Your practice sessions must be carefully planned to make the best use of your time.

, These cues are two-piece and stored in cases. The breaking the rack cue is heavier. Do not minimize the importance of the break just because it is just one shot. Learn how to shape the cue tip with sandpaper.

, Your concentration is important, do not think of anything else. Play smart, think strategy and logically. The first game in a tournament is a must win - do not think double elimination.

, With accuracy shoot straight and do not twist and rotate your body like a golfer, batter or quarterback.
Power is from putting your body behind the stroke. A power break is not just with your arms and shoulder. Follow through straight thru even after you make contact with the ball.
Choose between a power break and a non-power break based on your level of skill, your opponents and the strategy you choose against that particular opponent. The main thing here is your ability and your opponent's ability to run the table.

, If you are right-handed shoot right-handed and do not try to be ambidextrous. When in a position, where you cannot shoot normally, use the bridge stick.

, In a game, there is no separation or breaking down of the game - the parts of the game are often connected.


Long distance shots - is more difficult when the ball is close to the rail and when it is combined with another difficult maneuver such as a bank or combination shot. Even with long distance shots, practice to be able to use all types of English, including side english, besides power variation.
Setting up the cue ball for the next shot. Although not the most difficult shot, this is the most important element of the game.
Combination shots - are when more three or more balls are involved. Practice three ball combination shots.
Safeties - a safety is where you hide the ball because you do not have a good shot. Keep playing safeties until you can run the table. Do not take chances.
Bank shots. An example of a difficult bank shot to practice is where you must use the bank because another ball is in the way. In this situation, examine all possibilities and their outcomes. Do not merely avoid a penalty, try to go for a safety. In many situations you will have at least two banks to use, choose the one that is the safest. Do not go for the big score. Even in the most difficult of situations, go for the safety and be patient.

, When playing nine ball you must be able to run the table. A defining moment, after a lot of practice, to aim for, is to be able to pocket several balls in a row. When you become good, with the balls spread out from a break, aim to pocket all the balls without missing. If you practice, you will improve your accuracy.

, Read books and watch instructional DVDs.

Reassemble the outer rails.",How to Felt a Pool Table," Remove the pocket liners from each pocket first, if any are present. Next, find the bolts on the underside of the table keeping the railings in place, and remove them. Move the railing carefully to a safe storage space where it won't get scuffed or damaged, or interfere with your movement around the pool table.


The railing may be composed of one, two, or four pieces.If the railing does not divide into four pieces, you will likely need an assistant to transport it safely.
Some pool table pockets are bolted or screwed on separately from the railings.;
, Felt can be attached in more than one way. Use a staple remover if the felt is stapled to the table. If it is glued, you can simply rip the felt off, but be careful not to damage any felt in the pockets unless you also plan on replacing those portions as well., You may wish to use a level to test whether your billiards table is flat. If it is not, use a small pry bar to lift the lowest leg and add a wooden or metal shim.

, Use a dry, clean cloth to remove dust. Do not use any water or cleaning solutions. If old glue or other residue has built up, scrape this off with a putty knife or other flat blade, especially where it may block pockets., Most pool tables are constructed from three pieces of slate. On an old pool table, the seams between these may have lost some of the wax that fills them in to create a flat surface. If the wax needs replenishing, heat the slate around the seams with a propane hand torch, then drip wax into these seams. Spread the wax evenly across the seam line, let it cool for no more than thirty seconds, then scrape excess wax down to the level of the table surface using a paint scraper.It's better to remove too much wax than too little, since excess wax can be difficult to remove once dry.









If your pool table is kept in a warm location, you may wish to use putty specifically formulated for pool tables. There is a great deal of disagreement over which of these synthetic products produces the best quality table, so you may wish to consult a local expert familiar with your climate.

, Measuring will take the guesswork out of sizing your felt, resulting in a faster process and a cleaner result. When you purchase the felt, or more technically the pool tablecloth, for your table, make sure it is at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) longer than the table on all four sides. This ensures that you will have plenty of cloth for the railings as well as the table surface.


Note that pool felt is actually a special type of cloth, and while it is commonly referred to as ""felt,"" it is usually sold as ""pool tablecloth,"" ""pool cloth,"" or ""billiards cloth."" You cannot use ordinary felt to cover your pool table.
Woolen pool cloth is the pool felt most players are familiar with. Worsted cloth allows for greater speed, but is rarely used outside of professional tournaments due to its lessened durability and price. Other varieties such as snooker cloth, carom, or polyester cloth are only suitable for certain uses., Many tables have a wooden or particle board layer beneath the slate, allowing staples to be attached. You can check whether this is true of your table by examining the perimeter or vertical edge of your table. If there is only slate, use the instructions for gluing the felt instead.



Note: You will need a ""hammer tacker"" or manual stapler, or a staple gun.

, Typically, the felt comes in one large piece, and includes instructions for removing pieces to fit each railing. Follow these instructions carefully, or the cut pieces may not fit your table.


With some felt, you can make a one inch (2.5 cm) cut, then rip the felt by hand in a straight line.Other felt may require cutting with a razor blade or box cutter.

, Look for a sticker or other label that tells you which side is face up. If it is unlabeled, and you cannot easily tell which side is the playing surface, consult a professional. Different types of felt have a different feel, so it's best not to guess if you are not familiar with the feel of that type.









Hang more of the extra felt over the foot end, and not much on the head end where you will begin installation.
Check now for rips, scratches, or other defects that could require you to get a refund or replacement.

, Use your hammer tacker or staple gun to attach the felt to the wooden or particle board lining of the table at one corner of the head end. Have an assistant help you stretch the felt across the head end until there are no wrinkles present, keeping the overhang parallel with the table edge. Staple about every 3 inches (7.5 cm) along this stretched edge, ending at the second corner.









Professionals play on a very tightly stretched surface, which allows for greater speed. This is not necessarily desirable for most players, however, who may enjoy playing on a slower table.Always stretch at least tightly enough to remove all wrinkles, however.

, Move to one of the long sides of the table, and have an assistant help you pull the felt taut along its length. Staple at roughly 3 inch (7.5 cm) increments, but make sure to staple on either side of the side pocket.









Pulling the felt over each pocket when stapling on either side will give you extra material to work with when lining the pockets.

, Pull the felt tight from the last unstapled corner. Pay special attention to this, as an inconsistent pull can cause wrinkles in your table. If the previous staples make it impossible to create a flat surface with this pull, with the overhang parallel with the table end, you may need to remove a couple staples with a staple puller and try again. Once this is pulled to a smooth surface with the desired tightness, staple the short foot end and remaining right sides along their lengths.Remember to staple on each side of the side pocket.

, Make three slits in the felt directly over each pocket, then fold the loose felt down into the pocket and staple it inside the pocket. Once this is done, use a pair of scissors or a razor blade to snip off the excess felt.








, If your table has no wooden or particle board backing underneath the slate surface, you'll need to find a specialized adhesive to glue the felt to the slate instead. If you do see that backing, follow the instructions for stapling the felt instead.


3M Super 77 Multipurpose Adhesive is a popular option.

, Protect the edges of the table from spilled glue with a layer of newspaper, overhanging the edge.Remove newspaper from each edge just before you lower the glued felt.

, Felt usually comes in one large pieces, along with instructions for cutting off strips for each railing. Follow these instructions to ensure you end up with pieces of the correct size.

, If the ""face up"" surface is not labeled, try to identify it by feel or consult a professional. Your felt playing surface may be smooth, or it may have a ""nap"" in one direction, depending on the type; you may need to have an expert identify the face-up side if you are not familiar with the material. Arrange the felt over the table, leaving only a couple inches (a few centimeters) of overhand on the short head end. Make sure each overhang is as parallel to the table edge as possible.

, Fold the head end of the felt over onto the table, exposing the underside that will hang over the vertical side of the slate. Spray that portion of the underside heavily with the adhesive, and spray the slate where it will be attached as well.Let this sit until it becomes tacky, according to the adhesive manufacturer's instructions.

, Starting at one end, align the glued felt carefully with the slate, press down, then move along the glued end, pulling tightly as you attach it to the table. You may need an assistant to ensure the material is taut, especially at the beginning of the process.


The felt should be tight enough to prevent all wrinkles, but an ultra-tight surface is not necessary unless you want to practice for professional tournaments.Most importantly, you should pull the felt with the same pressure throughout this installation.

, The gluing process is identical for each of the remaining three sides. Wait at least a couple minutes between each side, or however long the adhesive manufacturer recommends to create a strong initial bond. Carefully pull each side taut before you apply glue, making sure there are no wrinkles on the cloth and you are pulling with the same force on every side.

, Trim the excess felt overhang on each side. One one side, cut a one inch (2.5 cm) wide strip of material for use as pocket liner. Cut off the material stretched over the pockets, then cut this strip into smaller pieces, gluing them over the vertical, circular surface of the slate to protect it from the pool balls.

, Use a staple puller or flathead screwdriver to remove the staples from the ends of the rails. Cut the old felt along the top of the rail if it does not come off immediately., Each rail has a thin wooden ""featherstrip"" running alongside it, which is typically not attached by any adhesive or nails. If it won't come up easily, Use a thin flathead screwdriver to pry it up without breaking it.

, Unlike the table top, this felt should be ""face side"" down. Keep an overhang of at least 4 inches (10 cm) on each end, and 1







, Lay the featherstrip back in position, but do not press it down. Have an assistant stretch the felt tightly between the center and one end of the railing. Place a tapping block over the featherstrip, then use a hammer to gently tap the block, pushing the featherstrip down into the stretched portion of the felt, but stop about 2 inches (5 cm) from the end, where the corner pocket will be located.Stretch the other half of the felt, and repeat this process for the remaining length of the featherstrip, again stopping 2 inches (5 cm) away from the other end.


Do not strike the featherstrip directly, or you may dent the table.

, Pull the felt at the ends of the table toward the rubber cushion, then tap in the remaining portion of the featherstrip until it is firmly in place. Trim and fold the felt as necessary to remove excess material and cover the ends of the cushion.

, Once all your rails are complete, bolt them to the table again. If you're having a hard time finding where the bolts should go, you can push a screwdriver through the bolt holes as guidance. Never try to cut holes in the playing surface from the top of the table, as you may cut in the wrong place.

Remove the rails and pockets.,
Detach the felt from the slate bed.,
Remove the slate screws with a drill.,
Lift each slate and place to the side.,
Disassemble the frame.,
Transport the slate carefully.",How to Disassemble a Pool Table1," Remove the pocket liners if present. Remove the screws or staples that attach the pocket straps to the table. If you don't have a staple remover, pry the staples out with a flathead screwdriver. Leave the pockets in place for now.


This is usually easier from under the table. Wear goggles to protect against falling staples.;
, There are usually three or four bolts under each rail.Remove them with a socket wrench.


Old pool tables may have special bolts with two holes. To remove these, order a forked tool from a pool table supply store., Pull apart any rail sections that detach easily and set them aside. If two rails are attached at a corner, flip them over onto the table with another person's help, then pull apart the two sections. Set aside the pockets as well.


Set the rails down carefully when flipping them, and take care to avoid bashing the side pockets., The felt is usually either glued down or stapled to the wood backing of the slate. If it is stapled, remove each staple carefully to avoid tears. If glued, pull the edge of the felt backward very gently (never up or forward), working your way around the table.Once you've removed the felt, fold it carefully. To avoid wrinkles and creases, do not press the fold lines.If the felt is wearing out, consider tearing it off and installing new felt during reassembly.

, These screws are usually at the corners of the table, but could be along the sides and center beam as well.If you find beeswax or putty over the screws, carefully scrape it off with a screwdriver to reveal the screw head without scratching the slate.

, Most tables have a playing surface made from three slate slabs, and each one can weigh 250 lbs (110 kg).Get a couple friends to help out and move them as carefully as possible. A scratch or chip in one slate could ruin the table, requiring an expensive replacement for all three slates.One-piece slates can weigh up to 800 lbs (360 kg).Enlist several strong people to help you move these.

, Flip the table over and unbolt the legs. Take apart the final lightweight pieces, and you're ready to go.

, The most difficult part to transport is the slate tabletop, which is both heavy and fragile. Recruit several strong people to load the slate onto a furniture dolly, on its side. Fasten the slate in place tightly with a furniture strap. If transporting by truck, fasten the strap around the slate and onto the truck slats.If at all possible, load it into the truck using a liftgate.If you put the pool table in storage, choose a climate controlled storage unit, or a room with minimal variation in temperature and humidity. Lay the slate onto plastic sheeting, and tape more plastic sheeting over it. Store the carefully folded felt in a sealed plastic bag, and all other components in moving blankets or other protective materials."

Remove only the rails and legs from a coin-operated table.,
Use caution with ball return systems.,
Transport non-slate tables in one piece.",How to Disassemble a Pool Table2," Remove the rail bolts with a socket wrench and detach them from the table. If two lengths of rail are connected at a corner, you may need to flip them over before you detach them gently. Carefully flip the table over and unbolt the legs. Do not attempt to disassemble the rest of the table without professional help, since removing the coin-operated mechanism can make reassembly difficult or impossible.Some Valley Dynamo coin-operated tables have a metal trim covering the rail bolts. Remove the screws holding the trim in place, slide the trim toward the corner, then lift them up and out., Most tables with a ball return system are also coin-operated, but some tables from the 1970's or '80's have a simpler mechanism.In some models, removing the mechanism without damaging the table is difficult.Unless you have a manual for your model, leave the ball return mechanism attached during transport.


You can usually disassemble the rest of the table as described in the standard slate table instructions.

, If your pool table surface is made from fiberboard (MDF), wood, or any other non-slate material, it is most likely a low-cost ""disposable"" table. These are not usually meant to be disassembled, not even by a professional.Transport the table in one piece.


Some of these tables have folding legs to make transport easier.

Find a large cardboard box.,
Stuff with shrink wrap or plastic bags.,
Tape the box shut.,
Test the target.",How to Make an Archery Target1," This should be at least 12 inches (30cm) thick to stop the arrows, or 18 inches (46cm) thick if you're using high velocity arrows or high draw weights. The other dimensions are up to you, although beginners and children usually need a target about 18 x 18 inches (46x46cm).


Don't try this method if you're firing high-powered crossbows or compound bows.;
, Practically any store gets rid of shrink wrap in huge quantities. Ask an employee, and you might be able to pick it up for free. Alternatively, stuff with plastic bags or expanding insulation foam.Pack as much as you can into the box.

, Seal the box completely with packing tape or duct tape. You've just made a portable archery target out of free or very cheap components.

, Test the target in an open area with no one standing nearby. Shoot from closer than you usually do, to make sure there's a margin of safety. If the arrow travels through the target, use a larger box and make sure the stuffing is tightly packed.


Always use field point arrowheads when target shooting.Broad head arrows may break on impact.

Plan a lumber frame.,
Cut a hole to allow for stuffing.,
Screw the lumber together.,
Staple on chicken wire.,
Gather stuffing.,
Compress the stuffing.,
Cover the shooting surface.",How to Make an Archery Target2," This is a hollow frame, with no front or back. Use 2x12 lumber (38x286mm) so the target will be deep enough to stop most arrows. The width and height are up to you, but don't go larger than a 3 x 3 ft (0.9x0.9m) shooting area if you want to keep it portable.


For a longer outdoor lifespan, use kiln dried boards, and/or treat them with weather protection.Use longer boards than necessary for the sides, extending them below the shooting area. This lets you raise the target or attach casters to make it more portable.

, Cut a large hole in the board that will form the top of the frame. After assembly, you'll stuff the target through this hole.

, Archery practice puts a lot of force on the target. Fasten the frame with wood screws at least 3½"" (9cm) long.For an extra-sturdy frame, run all-thread through the left and right sides of the frame. Tighten with an oversized washer, ordinary washer, and nut in that order. tighten again after your first test shoot, as the frame can jolt out of place.

, Cover the front and back openings of the frame with chicken wire to hold the stuffing. Wrap it around the sides and staple many times to the frame.The chicken wire will bulge over time from the force of the arrows. To reduce the amount of re-packing, you can reinforce with three or four tie-wires on the interior of the chicken wire.
This can be the weakest point in the target. Some people prefer using nylon window screen material.If you'll be using shrink wrap or other stuffing that can come out the mesh reinforce the chicken wire with several layers of thick cardboard.

, You'll need a huge amount of material to stop an average arrow. Here are a few common options, which you may be able to find in bulk at some used stores and rag stores, or by asking for waste at any retail store:


Shrink wrap, foam, plastic bags, or other compressible packing material.
Old carpet, cut into strips the depth of the frame
Blankets, feed bags, burlap sack, and other spare fabric
Shredded rubber (from a landscaping store)
Clothing, after removing all buttons, zippers, metal objects, screen-printed fabric, and anything else that might chip the arrow or melt.Denim, other fabric, or double-layer material (e.g. pockets) may make the arrow stick in the target; avoid it or place it at corners where arrows are unlikely to hit., Pack the stuffing as tightly as you can as you insert it into the frame. Any time you notice a gap, push in smaller scraps of stuffing through the chicken wire or from above. Frequently compress as you stuff with a sledgehammer or other weight, or tie it down with a ratchet strap and tighten periodically., Adding the cover is the final step to a good archery target. The cover will need occasional replacement as it gets beat up, so attach it underneath easily removed 1x4 planks (19x84mm). Here are a few common options:


Weed barrier / ground cloth

Go to a local skate park.,
Learn how to go up and back down a half-pipe and quarter-pipe.,
Try some grinds: these are simple tricks when attempted on small enough obstacles (you'll need aggressive-style skates for these).",How to Start Aggressive Inline Skating," Whether or not they are aggressive style doesn't matter yet, but chances are you have a pair of inline skates sitting around your garage or in your closet or room somewhere. If you don't have a pair though, go buy some (if you're broke, borrow some from a friend). Make sure that they provide a good amount of ankle support and get used to the fact that your ankle doesn't move when you're skating, because if there isn't ankle support than you may end up seriously screwing up your ankles if you land on them incorrectly.;
,, A few easily tackled obstacles would be things like: the recycling bin (emptied first), jumping off of curbs, jumping down a very small amount of steps (2 or 3), and as time goes on you can move to bigger and bigger objects.

, Instead of just jumping over the objects, try doing a 180 over said object.

, Start on the smaller flat ramps and either near the end of the first visit or at the beginning of the next, try dropping in on a quarter or half-pipe.

, This is called airing out of the ramp.

,


Find a curb or a short ledge of some sort.
Approach the obstacle at a slow speed. When you reach it, jump onto the obstacle placing the h-block or center of your frame onto the corner slide across the surface keeping the center of your balance on your leading foot and jump off when you either feel yourself falling or whenever you reach the end of the object. If you don't slide across your obstacle there are two things you should do.

If you have four wheels on each skate, try taking out the middle two. You actually don't need them to roll anyway, and they just get in the way when grinding. With most aggressive skates there are two very small wheels that don't even touch the ground, you don't have to take those out, they are for helping your grinds, and they don’t get in your way.
Apply wax to the surface you are grinding on. you can use candle wax for this, but there is special skating wax commonly used for just this purpose.

Use your knee pad to stop.,
Use the heel or toe brakes.,
Perfect the spinout stop.",How to Stop on Roller Skates1," Since it is typically recommended to wear safety gear when you are skating, you should have knees pads on already. To perform this stop, slowly lower one knee to the ground and allow it to drag. This is a good stopping technique for beginners as it takes very little skill to perform. You don’t want to rely on it, just use it as a backup when necessary., Since inline skates typically have a heel brake and quad skates have toe stops, these are a basic, common way to stop. Both brakes are best used with your legs scissored, one forward and one back. To use the heel brake, the skate with the heel brake should be forward. Lift your front foot toes and gently apply pressure to the brake. To use toe stops, lift your back leg heel and apply pressure to the toe stop., Plant one foot and allow the other foot to trace a wide circle around your body. This transfers your motion from forward to circular movement, which slows you down to a stop while keeping you fixed in one location. This is most effective if you plant your dominant foot and allow your non-dominant foot to trace the circle around you. This is also an effective movement if you just want to slow down and not come to a complete stop."

Get out the things you'll need.,Cut 3 centimeter (1.2 in) lengths from the pipe and make a mark 2/3 from one of the sides (1cm)

,Put the screw in from the side farthest from the mark to a little behind where the mark is, and hammer on it from both sides till you can't get it out by and (you have too unscrew it, but later)

,Hammer the sides diagonally and fold them to make a point form (it doesn't matter if it's perfect, you'll get it into better shape later)

,
Cut the sides on the bottom of the point and fold them over the sides.,
Assemble the arrow.,
Glue on your arrowheads and paint the shafts if you're going to.,
Cut the feathers/bike tire in more or less this shape (10-12cm across and 2 cm in the highest point), and make a mark along the arrows circumference 4 centimeter (1.6 in) from the back of the arrow.,
With your pencil sharpener, sharpen the end of the arrow (the will-be nock) until it is about half the diameter as the rest of the shaft.",How to Make Arrows Using Pipe,";
,,,, If you want to, use the grinder to polish, sharpen, and point the arrowheads

, You'll need normal, wood shafts (they don' have to be any wood in particular.

, After you've glued on the points, cut the arrow to the right length. It can be done holding the arrow to you're anchor point and placing it on your extended arm – as if in shooting position - and adding the index fingers length) (by hammering and cutting in various ways you can't get different arrowhead forms – the middle one is a fishing arrow, and the right one is a poorly made hunting arrow)

, The backs of your fletches will touch this point. Make three marks in equal distance (this distance will be the same as the diameter of the shaft – in my case, 8mm) one from the other and glue the fletches as straight as you can. If you can, make one of the fletches (the guide one) parallel with the arrowhead.

, Heat your knife (it will turn black and you probably won't want to use it again for eating) and cut (with heat – if you saw the nock it will break quite quickly) about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) into the shaft (lengthwise). This cut has to be perpendicular to the guide fletch, and preferably to the point. Then heat the nail and at the end of the nock (where the string will be when it's nocked) pass it through widthwise, parallel to the cut you just made. You can also tie a bit of string bellow the nock to make it last longer.

Spread your legs wider than your shoulders.,
Point your toes slightly in toward each other.,
Bring your feet slowly closer together.,
Let the inside wheels rub each other.",How to Stop on Roller Skates2," Although you most likely skate with your feet about shoulder width, to make this stopping technique most effective you must widen your stance. As you do this, it is helpful to bend the knees a little, as well. Don’t spread your legs so wide that it feels like a strain, just make them wider than they normally would be during skating., Slowly angle your feet so that your toes are pointing toward the center. The natural tendency of your feet may be to close the gap between them when you point your toes, but you want to make sure you keep a wide stance for now. You want to make sure not to point them too sharply inward or you may end up falling. Angle them just enough that you can tell they are pointed in.Pointing your toes inward makes the wheels roll at a slight angle which creates more friction than if they were pointing straight forward. This is where the stopping power comes from.

, Pointing your toes inward will already start to slow you down, but coming to a full stop, especially if you need to stop quickly, requires you to bring the feet closer together. Going from a wide stance to a very tight stance may make you feel a little wobbly, so go slow and keep the knees slightly bent rather than straight and rigid.

, Once your feet are close and still pointing inward, adjust so that the front wheels are just barely touching. Allowing the wheels to rub together adds just enough friction to slow you down all the way to a stop. Again, you don’t want to let them slam together and rub so hard that you stop immediately as this will likely result in you losing balance and falling forward.

"
"
Bend your knees.,
Move your non-dominant foot farther back.,
Lift your back foot off of the ground.,
Turn your back foot perpendicular to your front foot.,
Place your back foot on the ground.,
Keep your hips aligned forward.,
Drag your back foot until you stop.",How to Stop on Roller Skates3," This is good posture for skating anyway, but bending the knees slightly is important for stopping because it helps you keep your balance. It also makes the movements easier to perform. You don’t need to be crouching down in a sitting position, just have them bent slightly past straight. The bend in the knees gives you a lower center of gravity.How much you bend your knees can be affected by your height, such that taller people may want to bend their knees a little more for better balance.

, As you are still moving, slowly scissor your legs so that your non-dominant foot (whichever one you’d be less likely to kick a ball with) slides backward. At the same time, move your dominant foot a little more forward. Keep both feet facing forward for the time being.Shift the majority of your weight onto your front foot. This may feel a little awkward at first and it takes good control of your balance, so practice this part a lot. Keeping weight off of your back foot prepares you to move it while performing the stop.

, Lift your back foot off the ground just enough so you are able to turn the foot sideways. You don’t need to lift it high in the air, but make sure it doesn’t touch the ground yet until you get it positioned properly. This will require you to glide momentarily with weight only on your front foot.

, Perform this part at the same time as lifting your foot to create a smooth motion of lifting and turning. When you turn your foot, it should be sideways, with your toes pointing outward, as much as possible. The goal is to have this foot be at a 90-degree angle to your front foot., Do this gently rather than stomping your foot down. At 90 degrees to your front foot and keeping your legs scissored, set the foot down. It should be about one foot behind your front foot. Even as you set the foot back down, you don’t want to put much of your actual weight on the back foot. You will simply apply a bit of pressure.The movement of lifting the foot, turning the foot, and setting the foot back down should be done as quickly and smoothly as you can. The goal is to have the three motions turn into one smooth motion.
Remember that since your legs are scissored and your foot is pointing sideways that it will come down onto the ground at a slight angle towards the rest of your body. Your front leg skate will be straight up but your back skate will be at an angle.

, It is easy to start spinning or veering to the side if you let your hips loosen up to face sideways, which would feel more comfortable. If you let your hips open up to the side, you won’t keep going forward like you want to. Be sure that you keep the hips squared forward with your front foot. This also takes conscious effort as it can feel like a strain., Do not put weight on the back foot, just apply enough pressure to slow you down. The more pressure you apply, the faster you will stop. Gauge how much stopping room you have and apply pressure accordingly."
"
Most inline skates have a brake at the back of one boot.,
Don't look down or lean forward.,
Pop up the toe of the brake skate, putting a firm pressure on the brake by extending your knee.,
As you apply the brake, sit a little, dropping your weight by lowering your butt; again don't lean forward!",How to Stop on Inline Skates1," To use it, bend your knees deeply and put your legs in a 'staggered' position with the 'brake' skate (usually, the right) in front. It is important to get the rear leg back a bit as well, and keep your feet no more than shoulder width apart.;
, Keep your hands and eyes up on the road ahead and your back upright.

,









Do not lean forward. Leaning forward will actually reduce your brake power. The last part is the 'sit.'

, This is like standing on the brakes of a car. You should stop very quickly once you 'sit.'








"
"
Try a 'T-Stop' or 'V Stop'.,
Use hockey stop.,
Try the aggressive snake.,
Do not try to grab something to help you stop.,
Get a helper.",How to Stop on Inline Skates2," Drag one foot behind you with the toes turned out, so that the wheels of your skate are perpendicular to your direction of travel. Apply some downward pressure with that foot until you've stopped. When first attempting this, try a fairly deep 'lunge' position, Keep your shoulders facing your intended direction of travel, and slide the rear 'drag' skate left or right to compensate for any turning motion or to steer.








, In essence a very fast turn left or right. Good on relatively smooth surfaces, but takes practice to perfect. It is actually harder to do when moving slowly as you almost have to jump into it.









To practice, pad up and go to a roller rink and give it a shot. Once you are comfortable moving in a straight line (knees slightly bent) decide on a direction. Let's say right. As you lean into that tight right hand turn, the lead foot should be the direction you are turning, you almost follow the path of the lead foot with the trail foot (left in this case). Keep knees slightly bent through the whole maneuver. The lower you are, the better balance you will have, so ending more isn't such a bad idea.

, This technique works perfectly when you are moving at high speed and need to slow down or control your speed. What you do is twist and turn left and right very sharply. This will dissipate your forward momentum very quickly.








, This is a very bad habit and can lead to accidents and injuries.

, You can use a friend to help you stop when you are beginning, but try not to get used to this method.

"
Fall down deliberately.",How to Stop on Inline Skates3," This is not a joke; if you're not going very fast and can control your fall, it works very well (also works when skiing). Just bend your knees and crash on your pads. This also gives you the confidence that the pads will actually protect you and helps reduce your fear of a fall.

Find the freshest wood possible.,
Clean the branch.,
Find string.,
Arrows require special wood.",How to Make a Natural Bow and Arrow1," It would be best to cut a branch directly off of a tree but wood can be sourced elsewhere as well. The ideal branch would be flexible, snap right back into place when bent and also have a slight natural curve.


Be sure you are allowed to use the wood you are taking. Your neighbors may not like you cutting their trees and some trees in local parks or forests may be sensitive or endangered.;
, Remove all extra twigs, though you may want to leave a short one in the middle of the bow to use as a guide for the arrow. Remove the bark in order to make the bow easier to hold and the arrow easier to loose.

, Ideal string will be about six inches shorter than the bow itself. Thinner, stronger string is best.

, Find a stick that is thin, light weight, and strong. This will help ensure that the arrow flies fast and straight.

Make two slits.,
Anchor the string.,
Check the length of your string.,
String the bow.,
Unstring it when you're done practicing.",How to Make a Natural Bow and Arrow2," These should be about an inch from each end of the branch. The slits should be angled toward the branch so that the string will stay in place.

, First tie a strong knot at the first slit. Pull on the string to make sure it stays in place.

, Make a knot at the other end, about 6 inches (15.2 cm) shorter than the length of your bow. This will give the bow tension and curve after it has been strung.

, Bend the bow and slowly pull the knot until it reaches the slit on the other end of the bow. If you did everything right, then the string should be tight and give the bow a slight curve.

, If left strung for too long the bow will bend and lose tension.

Attach your arrowhead.,
Attach your fletching.,
Nock the arrow.",How to Make a Natural Bow and Arrow3," Use a rock or other small, blunt object to the end of your arrow with duct tape. You may also wish to wrap the entire end of the arrow in duct tape to reduce damage caused by impact. This end should be the heaviest, as it allows the arrow to travel further.

, Fletching is the material at the end of the arrow which helps guide it as it flies. If you don't know how, here's how to fletch arrows.

, Take a knife and cut a slit at the end without the arrowhead to make the nock. This will help the string guide the arrow.

, Make a target out of straw or foam, with a cardboard casing. If you're shooting at a fence, use a rug to protect your arrows. If they hit a fence they will likely break.

, You may wish to learn more about archery. Many local sports clubs, gyms, universities and community centers offer cheap or free classes in archery. Acquiring proper training will make your new skills safer and more enjoyable.

, Don't do anything that could lead you to injure yourself or others. This is not a toy and it will hurt if you hit someone. Also, don't use this to hunt animals, as it ineffective and cruel for this purpose.

, Look for a somewhat sloping, smooth area, but not too steep. A sidewalk, hallway or road works well. Avoid streets with car traffic or areas with lots of cracks, stones or other obstacles on the ground.

, Stand near a table at first so you can get used to how it feels to put your weight on your heels, where your wheels are. Rocking back on your heels is how you roll.

, Now that you're familiar with your heelys, time to put them to the test. Rock back on the heel of one foot, and use the toe of your other foot to take a step and push forward. As you push forward, transfer your weight to the heel.








, Now that you're in motion, put the heels of both feet on the ground and roll. Don't lean back too far, or you might fall on your rear end!









Keep your weight balanced over your heels.Keep one foot slightly ahead of the other foot.

Look for a board that's 6 feet (1.8 m) long, 1""x2"".
Oak and lemonwood are good woods for your first bows.Osage and yew make the best bows, but are difficult to work with.
Do not use pine, poplar, or other soft woods.;
, The board doesn't have to be straight, but you want the grain to run straight, both on the face and the sides. Ideally, the grain should run straight down the length of the board (not off the edges), so that the back of the board is a single layer of wood unbroken by any growth rings. A technique you can use to learn the direction of the grain is to run a pointy object down the length of the board. The pointy object should follow the grain and will tell you if it runs off the edges of the board. It's unlikely that you'll find such a board at lumberyard, so get a board with as few defects as possible.

,
Follow the natural grain.
If there are knots in the wood, work around them, not through them.

, It will be far easier to shape the two together.

Note that 20"" is actually going to be 19"" because you've carved a 1"" notch.
Tie a string from one end of your stave to the other.
Stand the tillering board upright and rest the bow in the notch.
Push the string down. Since you haven't begun carving the belly yet, it won't bend more than a few inches.

,


Taper towards the tips of the stave.
Don't take too much wood off at once.
Every so often, go back to the tillering board and ensure that the limbs are both bending evenly.
You can use a belt sander here which will save a lot of time, but it can also lead to big mistakes happening rather quickly.

,,


From one end, look down the length of the bow and ensure that the string runs through the center of the bow. If you carve one side too much, the bow can twist and pull the string off-center.

, If carve too much, there's no going back. You want to aim for a specific weight at a specific draw length, and stop when you get close.

, At each end of the stave, use a round file and file the nocks for the string. They don't need to be too deep, just enough for the bowstring to sit. They should be diagonal, high in the back, low towards the belly.

Approach the bow from an angle.Hold your dominant hand out in a position that is perpendicular to the ground.,
Let the bow grip fall into the pocket of your hand.,
Relax your fingers around the grip.",How to Hold an Archery Bow1," Turn it clockwise by about 20 to 35 degrees. Your fingers should be loose and spread apart in a natural, relaxed manner. This is the position you will need to grasp the bow with.


If you are using your left hand, turn the bow counter-clockwise instead of clockwise.
You need to resist the temptation to ""shake hands"" with the bow. In other words, do not grasp it directly from a straight angle. Doing so can put your hand off-center with the grip, so the bow is more likely to twist as you use it. Moreover, you are also more likely to grab the bow too tightly in this position, which could also lead to unwanted twisting of the wrist while shooting.;
, With your hand still in its previous position, note the pocket that forms inside the palm of your hand. Lift your fingers upward slightly and slide the grip into this natural pocket.


If you are unable to feel the pocket, you might be forcing your fingers open too much. Doing this can cause the muscles in your palm to stretch and become tense, which can cause this pocket to disappear.
This pocket is the only secure spot you can hold the bow with. If you grab the bow grip with any other part of your hand, your hand is likely to change position once you apply pressure.
A more precise location of this spot is where the radius bone meets the palm, directly at the base of your thumb. It also happens to coincide with your lifeline.

, Let the fingers of your dominant hand naturally hang along the handle or grip of the bow. Your index finger should brush against your thumb, but the rest of your fingers should be relaxed and loosely curled around the handle.


Your index finger and thumb are the only two fingers that should catch the bow after you make a shot. The rest of your fingers should not press down on the bow grip at all. If you have difficulty keeping the bow steady like this, you may also use your middle finger to help hold the bow in place, but you should never use your entire hand.
You may even decide to fold the bottom two or three fingers into your palm to keep them from getting in the way.
This is the way you should hold the bow when you are preparing to shoot an arrow.

Hold the crossbow like a rifle.Hold the crossbow so that the back is butted against your shoulder.,
Alternatively, bring the crossbow up above your shoulder.",How to Hold an Archery Bow2," Support the barrel of the crossbow at its center of gravity using your non-dominant hand. Hold onto the back of the crossbow around the trigger using your dominant hand.


The back of the bow should be positioned above and just to the inside of your armpit.
Wrap your non-dominant hand firmly on the barrel, supporting it from the bottom.
Keep your fingers out of the way of the trigger mechanism. Your index finger should be the only finger not bent while firing the bow.

, The second basic way to hold a crossbow is similar, but instead of supporting the back of the bow with your shoulder, you rest the bottom back on top of your shoulder. Your non-dominant hand still supports the barrel at its center of gravity while your dominant hand rests near the trigger.


Securely grasp the barrel of the bow with your non-dominant hand.
Position your dominant hand so that it rests to the outside of the bow. Your fingers should be extended, and your thumb should rest just below the trigger. When you shoot the crossbow using this method, you will activate the trigger by pressing up on it with your thumb.

"
"
Hold the bow perpendicular to the ground.,
Grab the bow with your non-dominant hand.,
Bend your fingers around the grip.,
Keep your hand relaxed, yet steady.",How to Hold an Archery Bow3," When you first grab the bow, do so while the bow is in a horizontal position. The bow should line up vertically with the strings, and the entire thing should face the ground at roughly a 90 degree angle.A well-made recurve bow will usually have a grip on it that naturally guides the and in place. Even so, it can be a good idea to know how to place your hand on the bow correctly, just in case the balance of the grip does not work for your strength and height or in case you must use a cheaper recurve bow.

, The grip should rest inside the pocket of your non-dominant hand. This pocket is the natural gap that lies in between your palm and your thumb.


If you cannot find the pocket of your hand, try to relax the muscles in your hand more. Oftentimes, tense muscles can cause this pocket to disappear.
Note that if you fail to grab the bow with this portion of your hand, you may not have enough stability to control the bow as you draw it back to shoot.
Ideally, the force of your hand should be at the lateral center of the bow grip and just slightly below the vertical center of the grip. The grip usually lies at the center of the bow. If your bow does not have a grip built into it, grab it near the center and adjust your hand placement accordingly until you can get a firm enough grip to prevent the bow from swaying as you hold it.
You may need to test your hold on the bow by drawing the string back. The hand should feel comfortable, and the center of your hand should come into full contact with the center of the bow grip. There should also be no pressure or force on the wrist during a shot.

, The thumb should rest on the back of the bow grip, and the index finger should wrap around the front and barely brush against your thumb from the other side, if at all. Ultimately, the index finger and thumb must both feel firm without feeling tense.The remaining three fingers of your hand should gently curl toward the front of the bow grip. You may notice that the middle and ring fingers can wrap around the grip while the pinky curls and presses against the grip. The important thing to remember is simply to prevent your fingers from getting stressed.
The position of your fist, including the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers, should move down diagonally at a 45 degree angle from the bow.
Note that the force of the bow should be placed on the thumb and index finger. These two fingers are the only ones that will really end up controlling to direction of the bow.

, The placement of your fingers should not change as you draw or release the bow. Also note that the tension should only exist in your hand and nowhere else. In other words, keep your wrist, arm, and shoulder relaxed.


Also note that the left part of your palm should not be allowed to touch the actual grip part of the bow. Instead, it should face downward, toward the ground. If the palm touches the bow, you will be unable to turn the bow arm inward, which can lead to a bad shot.

Hold the bow at a 90 degree angle.,
Bring the bow into contact with the ball of your thumb joint.,
Curve your fingers around the bow grip.,
Keep the force in your hand.,
Finished.

",How to Hold an Archery Bow4," The entire bow should be perpendicular to the ground. The stick portion of the bow should appear horizontal, as well as perpendicular to your body, and the strings should line up with the stick on a vertical plane.


The longbow varies from the recurve and compound bow in that the wrist grip needs to be positioned a bit lower in order to maintain adequate balance. You will ultimately apply more pressure with the heel of your hand, and the pivot point will be further away from the arrow.

, Position the bow grip in your non-dominant hand so that the primary point of contact lies roughly on the the base of your thumb. More precisely, the bow should rest just outside of the thumb joint, at the fleshy part of your hand just below the pocket of your thumb.


The ""pocket"" refers to the portion of your hand in between your thumb and palm. As long as your hand is relaxed, you should easily find this natural space composed mostly of flesh.
Unlike a recurve or compound bow, the point of contact you have with a long bow should be at the lowest part of this pocket rather than at the center. The force must ultimately rest on the heel of the hand and below the thumb joint, so this should be where your primary point of contact is.Be careful as you grip your bow. If your grip is too near the thumb, you will have poor aim and will ultimately end up stressing your thumb joint. If your grip is too near the palm, the bow will be highly unstable.

, You may need to play around with finger placement in order to find something both firm and comfortable, but as with other bow types, most of the control will come from the thumb and index finger.


The thumb should wrap around the back of the bow. The knuckle may end up resting toward the inside edge of the grip, but only slightly and not in a dramatic manner.
The index finger will usually wrap around the front of the bow and meet the thumb from the other side. Note, however, that you should only just barely allow these two fingers to meet. If they are pressed together, you are likely gripping the bow too tight or strangling it. This can cause serious pain to your hand, and it may also slow the flight of the arrow when you shoot.
The remaining three fingers should wrap around the front of the bow. Keep them relaxed and natural, but firm. The pinky finger can move around some and is not a crucial element of the grip, but usually, you will still want it to curve around the front of the bow.

, The pressure should rest on the ball of your thumb as you shoot, and the wrist should remain as straight as possible.When you draw the bow string back, your elbow will need to be level with your shoulder in order to maintain this balance in your hand. Your wrist should never be forced to flex during the process, and you should keep as much pressure as possible out of your arm muscles.

Select a piece of curved wood that is easily bent.,

String the arrow in the bowstring.",How to Create a Simple Bow and Arrows," It should go above your head when you hold it straight out in front of you (like you were about to shoot) You can choose to make it smaller if you wish, but this size gets the most power.;
, Whittle it down so that both ends should be roughly the same size, but the center of the bow should be thicker than the ends. If you wish, you may take some fabric and wrap it around the center for a handle. At both ends carve half-moon shaped notches for the string to go.

, be stretchy , the power comes from the bow, not the string. make sure it is tight enough to make the bow bend slightly. When you pull back on the string even very slightly, it should vibrate when you let go. (Never dry fire; pulling the bow string back to full length and letting go without a loaded arrow, it will weaken the bow over time)

, it should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) longer than the length of your arm. cut off any growths growing off the sides of the arrow. Strip it of it's bark. Take your knife and carve a notch in one end of the arrow (for the string) and make sure it is large enough to let the string pass through.

, If you would like you can fashion an arrowhead out of a piece of flint, rock, bone, or glass and tie it to the tip.

,, With the two fingers of your dominant hand, place your index finger above the arrow, and your middle finger below and pull back, holding the middle of the bow in your non-dominant hand. Release and let your arrow fly!

Consider a compound bow.,
Reflect on recurves.,
Learn about longbows.,
Ask an archery club for advice (optional).,
Find a physical store.,
Examine different materials.,
Choose a draw weight.,
Try before you buy.,
Decide on the bells and whistles.,
Pick out extra supplies.",How to Choose an Archery Bow," Compound bows use modern materials and a system of several strings and pulleys, making them the most powerful and accurate type of bow.The compact size of the bow makes it well suited to hunting. On the other hand, compound bows are complex to maintain and tend to be more expensive than other bows.


As a beginner, choose a compound bow that has a wide weight range (resistance). This allows you to start at a low draw weight (the force required to pull back the bow) and still take powerful shots. As you become stronger, you can adjust the bow to higher draw weights to increase power.;
, Recurve bows are a more traditional form of bow, with just one string and a piece of wood. They are called recurves because the unstrung bow bends away from holder. Stringing it pulls the limbs back into a normal bow shape, and this extra force increases the power of the bow. Recurves are common in shooting competitions, though they can be used to hunt small animals., If you picture Robin Hood, you probably imagine him shooting a longbow. These are classic, straight-limbed bows now used almost exclusively for target shooting. They are not as accurate as the other options, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with them. Some target shooters consider it more exciting when a bullseye is a significant achievement.


Flatbows have a similar shape, so much so that the two terms are often used interchangeably. The ""American flatbow"" design is one of the most popular.
A large longbow can require a huge draw weight to fire, which is difficult for most beginners.

, Just like other hobbyists, archers can talk for hours about the pros and cons of different bows. If you're planning to shoot at an archery range anyway, contact some archers in advance. They should be happy to help you find a beginner bow that matches what you're looking for, or at least tell you where to shop.


Some archers may have a used bow to sell you for cheap.

, Nothing can replace picking up and testing a bow when deciding whether to buy it. Even experienced archers choose bows that ""feel right,"" a quality you can't figure out online. It's worth the drive to an archery, sporting, or hunting supply store.


If you can't find a local archery store, regional archery organizations often have online stores. This can be a good way to see reviews and other information as well.

, Plastic bows are cheaper, but break sooner and have a limit to how powerful they can be. Wood is more reliable, and metal is even better, but you'll be paying extra for that benefit. There's nothing wrong with getting a flimsier learning bow and moving up if you stick with the hobby.


Recurve bows can be one solid piece, or ""takedown"" bows with detachable limbs. A plastic recurve bow with wooden limbs is a solid choice for a beginner. It's not too expensive, and you can upgrade the limbs slowly to increase draw weight.
Skip this step if shopping for compound bows, which are almost exclusively metal.

, The draw weight is the amount of force it takes to fully pull back the bowstring, usually written on the side of beginner bows. The biggest mistake beginners make is picking a bow with too much draw weight. If it's a strain to pull back the bowstring once, think about repeating that fifty times. Here's a rough guide for beginner draw weights, assuming average strength for your age and sex:Adult men should try 22–28 pound recurve bows, or 40–50 pound compound bows
Adult women should try 16–26 pound recurves, or 30–40 pound compounds.
Teens aged 14–17 typically fire 12–16 pound recurves, or 14-22 pound compounds.
Kids 8–13 can try 10–14 pound recurves, or 10–22 pound compounds.
A 40 or 45 pound recurve bow is about the lightest usable for hunting.

, If the shop has an archery target, ask to test out the bow for a few shots. You may not be able to test accuracy all that well as a beginner, but you can see how comfortable it feels. Does it feel too light or too heavy to handle easily? Can you comfortably grip it and hold it steady? Don't be afraid to listen to your gut even if you can't say exactly what's wrong. If you don't enjoy handling your bow, you won't stay in the hobby long.


If you've never shot a bow before, ask the shop employee for guidance. Handling the bow with the wrong form could damage the bow.

, You can add on all manner of sights, silencers, and stabilizers. Most dedicated archers choose to do this, but as a beginner you could save some money and leave that decision until later. Although not as common as other forms of archery, you can find ""barebow"" shooting competitions using recurve or longbows with no additions.


If your bow is brand new, it probably needs an arrow rest and arrow plate installed., Naturally you'll need arrows, but that's not all. Get a bow stringer, and ask the shop employee to show you how to string your bow without risk of injuring yourself or the bow. Also pick up string wax, spare arrow fletchings, and a shooting glove to protect your fingers.


If you have a place to shoot at home, you'll need to buy a target or make your own.

, Your elbows should be out to the side.

, Keep your face towards the trampoline. Do not move your hands, but kick your legs and hips back with a small bounce and land in the front drop position as described above. Always kick backwards while doing this jump.


From a standing position without any bounce, jump onto your hand and knees then kick back into a front drop. You can do as many hands and knees bounces in the middle as you wish but try to decrease the number each time you do it.
If you can not understand the 'backward' motion,? go to the end of the trampoline, within a foot of the edge and look over the edge. Then perform the front drop! You see, your brain won’t allow you to throw yourself off the trampoline and land on your head. It will force you to move backwards, thus eliminating any pain from jarring your back.

, Try to get your chest to land just behind where your feet are.

, It then takes a lot of core and strength to lift you up to your feet. The good thing is that once you have mastered the backwards (no pain) motion, you can practice and practice until you are higher and higher.

, Don't freak out after one flip and land on your face.

, Don't go straight into the double. You will land your last bounce with their chest hanging way forward. This eliminates major height, so get used to landing straight up, then tucking.

, You might even start by not opening up at all. Just cowboy your flip (tuck with your knees out to the side) so your knees don't hit your face when you land. If you've been trying for a while, try to judge about 1/8 of a flip from landing before you open up.

, Next to fear, the landing is the hardest part of a double front flip. You either open up too soon and land on your butt or just can't get the power to flip that fast.


If you are opening too soon, stay tucked until you land.
Make sure you are committing to the trick.
If you are b, work on bouncing harder. If you can't bounce higher, buy a new trampoline.

, Watch the edge of the trampoline in front of you. For a single front flip, open up just as you can see it again for the first time. For a double, open on the second rotation. Flipping with your eyes open will tell you when to land.

, Do a back tuck, land, and convert it into a backdrop pull-over. Do that, but don't land after your back tuck so it will be like doing a complete back tuck to your back and then pulling your feet over. Work on this a lot before you think about a double back. make sure you find this skill easy before you think about a double back as well. Also it will help a LOT if you do your back tuck really high and quick so you are kinda just sitting in the air before you land on your back.

, After you can do this, pull your tuck really tight in and keep going without landing on your back. On your second back flip, keep your knees tucked as tightly as possible. If you do not, you WILL land on your neck. In fact, at first, don't even try to land on your feet at all. If you succeed at a double back and land on your knees or butt, it won't hurt nearly as bad as your back or neck. Have a professional spotter there at all times.

Check the frame's quality.,
Never purchase a trampoline with welded joints.,
Make sure the spring pad is made of PVC, both top and bottom.,
Choose the safety net.,
Don’t let a picture influence your decision.",How to Buy the Right Trampoline," The most important component to a trampoline is the frame. Choose a trampoline with the strongest and thickest frame. The most common round trampoline frame thickness is 1.2 to 1.5 mm. The stronger the frame, the longer that trampoline will last. You’ll never need to worry about the frame ever bending or warping, due to excessive usage or being pushed around. With stronger frames, you can also use stronger springs, for better bounce.

A quality round trampoline frame thickness should be at least 2.0 mm. 
A quality rectangle round trampoline frame thickness should be 3.0 mm. 
Make sure the frame is fully galvanized, both inside and out. Galvanization helps protect the frame against rust and corrosion.;
, Welded joints, over time, will crack. After excessive jumping and vibration, the integrity of the welded joints will give. If possible, go with t-joints. T-joints are much more durable. If anything happens to the t-joints, they’re always replaceable and very cheap. However, when welded joints crack, the entire top rail piece has to be replaced., PVC material lasts much longer than PE material. PVC material is more like plastic, which is the same material inflatable bouncers are made from. PE material is a cheap tarp material that will deteriorate after 5 to 7 months, from sitting in the sun. PVC material, if taken care of properly, can last 4 to 6 years. 

If the weather cover is used and a UV protectant spray is applied regularly, it can last a very long time. 
The thickness of the pad should be 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick. The thicker the pad, the better protection there will be against anyone getting caught in the springs or hitting the frame.

, There are two styles of safety net enclosure, outside and inside styles. 

The inside net enclosure wraps around the inside of the spring cover, completely preventing the jumper from ever being exposed to the springs. However, the flaw with inside net enclosures is that they have a very high defective rate, because it’s very easy for jumpers to land and fall against the net, thus ripping very easily. 
With the outside net enclosure, if the spring pad is thick and wide enough to cover the entire trampoline entirely, it should be just as safe.

, Ask questions and read up on the specifications. There are many things to consider when choosing the right trampoline, so always ask questions and do your research."

, Take a W shaped pole and insert a leg pole onto one end. Press the button in to join. Now put the other leg pole in the same way. Repeat this step with all of the remaining leg poles and W shaped poles.

, Take one W shaped section and insert it into curved section. Make sure the buttons on the straight poles are on the same side as the holes on the curved poles. Now do the same for the other four sections.

, Once the frame is connected, turn over the completed frame sections so that they are the correct way up. Place them roughly where they would be in the completed frame. Lift two of the frame sections up, holding one in each hand, and join them together as tight as possible to hold them in place. Continue to join the frame sections in this way until they are all joined together.

, Unfold the mat and place it roughly into position. Align the logo of the mat to be parallel to one of the W shaped poles of the frame.

, Take the springs, and using the end with the longer hook, place all the springs into the holes. Connect the shorter end of the spring to the mat using the spring tool to hold the mat in place. Count out around eight (8) to ten (10) buckles from where you put the first spring in. Keep attaching springs to the frame and the mat until there are eight (8) springs connected and evenly spaced around the trampoline frame. Nb. When using the spring tool, first remove the spring and connect it to the mat. Then use the spring to pull the spring away from the mat to and to the frame.

, Lay out the net out on the trampoline and find the seam to the left of the doorway. Align the hole at the base of the seam with the first spring to the left of the joint.

, Push the hole in the net over the buckle on the mat and attach the spring into place. Continue to move your way around the trampoline, pushing the net over the buckles and leaving a net hole for each spring that is already attached. Now attach all the springs in an even manner until they are all fixed onto the frame. Continue your way around the trampoline so that the mat is pulled evenly. Remember to fix the net onto the mat where you attached the first springs.

, Use the screwdriver to pry out the plastic plugs that are pressed into the frame joints. Do this for all the plugs.

, Place the pads on the trampoline with the pads facing the same direction as the logo on the mat. Turn the pads around until the holes in the pads align with the joints in the curved section on the frame. To fix the pads to the frame, unhook the nearest spring at the loop in the pads, and push the spring through the loop, then reattach the spring to the frame. Continue moving around the frame until the springs are all attached.

, Take one of the long net poles, and insert a hook bolt into the middle of the pole. Screw a nut onto the end of the bolt, and use the spanner to tighten. Make sure the nut is screwed on straight to avoid damaging the thread.

, Slide all three (3) of the covers over the foam covering the poles.

, Take one of the shorter net poles and slot the end with the smaller diameter inside the top of the lower pole. Turn the poles around until the holes are aligned. Make sure the elastic end of the hook is on the same side as the pole as the one previously installed. Fix the third hook bolt through the top of the shorter net pole, ensuring that the elastic is on the same side as the other net bolts. Attach all of the hooks into the remaining poles.

, Slot one completed net pole into the frame by guiding it through the safety padding, then into the hole in the joint. Turn the pole until the screw hole can be seen. Use the screwdriver to insert a screw into the joint and continue the same process for all of the poles.

, Starting with the plastic buckles at the top of the net, attach them to the hooks on the top of the poles. Do this for all the remaining buckles, and continue your way around until they are all attached.

, You have finished installing your Vuly trampoline with net.

Don’t wear jeans. They will become damp when you fall on the ice.;
, The ice gets cold, as you can imagine, so don’t forget the items that will keep you warm like gloves, a hat, a scarf and a light jacket.


Remember, you'll be moving around quite a bit. Choose a jacket that is warm but light. Also, a coat that hangs to the ground is a hazard.

, Keep your feet happy by wearing a thick pair of socks or tights. Skip the cotton socks as they do not absorb moisture very well. They also tend to be bulky which can cause blistering on the feet.


Instead, thin wool socks will work great. They should stretch up to your calf so they don't fall down while skating.

, Ask the rink attendant to give you two sizes to try. These should be your normal, everyday shoe size, plus one size larger. Put both pairs on to see how they feel laced up. Skates that are too loose will not provide the proper ankle support needed.They should feel snug but not so tight that they strangle your feet and cause your toes to go numb.


Lace the skates from the toe up. Tie the final knot firmly so that they do not become unlaced during skating. You can even tuck the ends into the top of the skates for extra security.

, This is a great way to understand some of the fundamentals of the activity. A lot of rinks offer short, introductory classes for all age groups. Be sure to ask a lot of questions and interact to get the most out of it.


Take friends along too. Even if they're pros, having buddies will make the time more enjoyable.

, With your skates on, work on your balance by walking around the venue on the carpet.If the venue offers blade guards, use them, as they will protect the blade. You may notice right away that you can’t walk standing straight up, nor should you. Instead, keep your knees slightly bent and put your weight on the balls of your feet.


Never take ice skates onto concrete. Falling will really hurt and you will ruin the blades.

, Falling is a natural part of the sport and it is bound to happen a couple of times. Even the greatest skaters fall. By learning to fall properly, you will reduce the possibility of a serious injury. While on the carpeted area, bend your knees and do a squat. Slowly fall backwards to the ground, landing on your bottom. Keep your chin tucked into your chest. This will keep your head from snapping back and hitting the cold, hard Try not to use your hands to break your fall. While on the ice, another skater could come flying by and run over your fingers. You could also badly injure your wrists.
Instead, leave your arms out at your sides or out in front of you.
Practice this several times before heading to the ice.

, Roll over onto your hands and knees. Place one foot beneath you, between your hands. Bring the other foot forward and push up slowly. When upright, keep your knees slightly bent to regain full balance.It’s important you get this technique down before getting onto the ice. When on the ice, try not to enlist the help of others to get you up. You could lose your balance again and pull them down with you.
Try to get up quickly as the ice is cold and may make you feel uncomfortable.

, When skating outdoors, it's critically that you check the pond/lake thickness. You can do this by simply calling the park administrators. Four inches is the recommended thickness for activities like these.Once they've checked, ask them to remove any debris like tree limbs that may have fallen onto the ice. You will want a clear path at all times.

, Never jump over the wall to get access to the ice. Other skaters may not see you. You could end up hurting yourself, as well as someone else.


When entering, notice the direction the traffic is flowing and head in the same direction.

, Walk around the edge of the rink. Hold onto the wall if necessary until you get a feel for the ice, your skates and overall balance. Remain relaxed and don’t rush to start zipping around the rink.


As you build confidence, slowly distance yourself from the wall but never going too far. Keep your arms out at your sides for balance.

, Keep your skates about shoulder width apart and knees slightly over your toes. Make sure that your chin remains parallel to the ice. Start with both feet pointing forward, then slightly turn the right foot out to create a 45 degree angle. This will be your pushing foot. Keep your weight centered directly over the skates. When ready, bend deeper onto the left knee and push out with your right foot.Hold the position and you’re gliding!

, Work on a two-foot stop in the beginning. To do so, point your knees slightly inward and press on the outside edges of your blades. Your toes will point inward towards each other as well. A little snow will kick up if done correctly. Don’t press too hard and jam your feet into the ice. Applying a tiny bit of pressure will slow you done and create a full stop.When practicing, notice your posture and try not to lean forward.
Try to get this technique down before moving on to more advanced skills.

, Most people do not nail ice skating the first time out so keep trying to improve. Work on your balance and getting comfortable with the fundamentals. Watch others that are doing well to hone your skills.

Keep repeating this until you can land on your hands and feet.,
Practice jumping higher and higher each time.,
Position yourself when you go for the jump and look backwards.,
Do a full backflip landing primarily on your feet.,
Get as much momentum as possible and land only on your feet.",How to Backflip on a Trampoline," Make sure you have someone with you when you are practicing flips for the first time – serious injuries are very possible if things go wrong. They can also spot you, making the whole process easier. Just make sure they don't get hurt themselves.









If the person you’re with is comfortable on a trampoline and knows what they’re doing, consider having them help launch and rotate you. They can place their arm near your back and help propel your feet over as you flip. Both you and your partner should be prepared for when you attempt. It is important to be prepared for when you will be rotating.
If the person you’re with isn’t comfortable on the trampoline or you’re not comfortable with another person being on it while you flip, have them standing off to the side, ready to take action if need be.;
, Start by warming up on the trampoline to get your body ready for the challenge. Jump around, limber up your legs, and get a feel for the material underneath your feet and how it bounces.









Some trampolines are a bit different than others. Make sure you're familiar with the one you're working up to a flip on and make doubly sure it doesn't have any weak spots. Falling through the trampoline is a very unsafe landing.

, Once you’re warmed up, do a backdrop. This means falling onto your back and bouncing right back up. When you feel comfortable enough, try the backdrop and throwing your legs over, like a small, slow somersault.









Try to do a backdrop, lifting your legs up and throwing the behind you, and then using the bounce back up to rotate behind you and onto your knees. This will get you used to the momentum of going backwards, which can be quite unnerving.

, A backdrop is the basics of this move, only it lacks the momentum. Now aim for a back handspring that’s more off to the side – it’s much less scary. Here’s how to do it.









Bend your arms at your elbows and imagine them going up and over your head, propelling you backwards and fully around into a full circle. This is the motion you need to keep throughout the jump.
Look behind you. This will drive your body as your neck brings the rest of your body with it. It will also help you place your jump.
Get a good bounce going and jump up straight.
At the peak of your jump, propel yourself over your shoulder. Aim to land on your hands.
At first, don’t worry about your landing. On your hands and then knees is fine.

, Once you get the over-the-shoulder handspring down, do a full back handspring. Instead of looking over your shoulder, you’ll need to look up and behind you. Other than that, it's the same. Make sure to get plenty of air!









If you propel yourself mainly backwards, you may fall off the edge of the trampoline. Start near the edge of the center, and aim to jump up and then around – not backwards. If you just throw your body back, you could seriously injure yourself.

, You’ll need one more push of momentum to get your feet on the same plane as your hands when you land. This power will come from your abs and hips – when you’re in the air, you’ll need to throw them into a fuller rotation. Remember: it’s the same as a handspring, but with your feet rotating a bit further around you.









Tuck in your legs and arms to get more momentum. You know how when an ice skater wants to go faster, she pulls herself in? Do the same thing for your flip, making your surface area smaller.

, While you're in the air, push as hard as you can and lean back and bend your knees. Look back like you're looking into the sky to find the trampoline.









You might over spin initially, but that’s all right. Don't give up if you don't get it the first few times. It’ll come. You’ve got to trust yourself!
Stop if you get frustrated; you can always pick it back up tomorrow. Practice makes perfect, and patience is a skill you can learn. You don't want to break your neck or tire yourself out, which could also lead to injury.

, To do this properly when you look backwards make sure you're not looking diagonal or to the side but straight to the back and make sure you can see the floor straight behind you. Be just a step or two away from center to give yourself a bit more room to land the jump. When you find the right place, your instincts will take over.









Remember the upward and then over momentum. This combined with a big bounce will be the set up to a successful backflip.

, Use your hands to steady you (or possibly to protect your neck), but flip so that the majority of your weight is being carried by and lands on your feet. At this point, it’s a backflip! Just not a graceful one yet.









For now, your aim is to get over your body, not to land it perfectly. Remember to use your arms to propel you up and then around – as long as you land and don’t hurt yourself, you’re doing it.

, Start by landing on your hands and knees, move to your feet and hands, and then, finally, get to just your feet. To do this, you just need more momentum and a higher jump – and possibly positive thinking.









If it makes you uncomfortable, don't force it. Give yourself time to get comfortable with each step.
If it's difficult for you, find friends who can walk you through it (flip you?), watch videos, and read more tutorials on different techniques. No two people do it the exact same way (unless they're professionally trained) – someone else may have a theory that works well for you.

Take up the slack.,
Lace the remaining top portion of the boot.,
Loop around the hooks.,
Tighten around the ankle with a lacing trick.,
Cross the laces twice.,
Tighten the knot.,
Take care of excess laces.,
Tie a bow in the last of the laces.",How to Tie Ice Skates," Seated in a chair, with your skate on a mat, press your foot firmly into a loosened skate. Take hold of both laces, one in each hand, and extend your leg enough so that you can rest your weight on the heel of the boot with your toes pointed slightly upward.;
, Loop your first two fingers through the lace at next to the hole one either side. Grab the laces firmly. Push down with the ball of your foot while pulling up on the laces.









Start with the laces closest to the toe of the boot.
You should be able to fit your finger between the lace and the boot once it is tightened.

, Once you reach the middle of the boot, the slack in the lace may start pulling the loose ends of the laces out of the holes in the top of the boot. Move to the top laced hole of the boot and pull the laces through from there to keep the top of the laces from being pulled out of the holes.









Once you have taken up the slack, return to tightening the boot until your reach the top.

, The top few holes of the boot are likely not laced at this point. Once you have tightened the laces up to this section, follow the same pattern as the rest of the laces to complete lacing the boot to the top. Cross one lace over the other and through the hole on the other side.








, Some skates have hooks at the top. Cross the laces as you would if you were lacing through holes, then draw the laces either from the top of the hooks down, or the bottom of the hooks up. Either direction will work. From there, draw the laces together in front of the skate to begin your knot.







, If you do not have hooks at the top of your skates and would like to make the ankle even more snug, try this trick. Instead of crossing your laces to the the top holes, take the laces directly up to the next hole on the same side. Feed the lace from the outside in through the top hole, creating a loop on each side. Now cross the laces and put them through the loops you just created on the opposite sides and pull to tighten. The space and leverage created by the loops will allow you to pull the laces tighter., Just like you would tie a shoe, cross one lace over the other and wrap it under and back out to the side. This time, though, repeat that process a second time before pulling the laces to the side tighten the knot.









Crossing the laces twice will lock the knot in place and keep it from sliding even if the bow comes undone.

, Pull up on the laces while rocking the toes of your skate forward. This will create a space between your crossed laces and the top of the skate. Pull the laces firmly to the side to get rid of the space, so the crossed lace are lying directly across the top of the skate.









Repeat this move several times until you cannot create the space under the crossed laces.

, You don't want to have any laces touching the ice or loops in your bow which are too big. These could cause the lace to end up between the skate and the ice and cause a tripping hazard. Wrap the remainder of the laces around the boot. Take the laces around the back of the top of the boot and pull them back to the front. Do this as many times as necessary until you are left with only enough length to tie a double knot and bow in the laces.








If you don't have too much excess lace, you can also tie a double bow to take care of the extra lace.

, Like tying a shoe, make a loop in one lace, then loop the other under and over the loop. This time, repeat this looping process to create a double loop for your knot. Finish the bow by pulling that lace through the two loops to create the other loop of the bow.

Wear proper protection.,
Turn on the machine.,
Figure out the radius size you need.,
Adjust the diamond dresser.,
Dress the grinding wheel.,
Mount and blacken a single skate.,
Sharpen your skate.,
Check your blade.",How to Sharpen Skates1," At bare minimum, you should wear shatter proof glasses or goggles when machine-sharpening skates. Ear and breathing protection are also recommended. Do not wear loose clothing or accessories that can be caught in the grinding wheel. Tie back long hair and consider a protective hair covering., Make sure that your work area is free from clutter. Before powering the machine, double-check that nothing is in contact with the grinding wheel, including the diamond dresser. Make sure the grinding wheel is balanced before you begin.


Some machines require that the diamond dresser be in position, touching the wheel, before the machine is turned on. Read your machine's operating manual to determine if this applies., The default that most skate shops use is a 1/2"" radius, which is standard for young skaters. A smaller radius will create a deeper hollow, creating better grip and more drag. A larger radius, on the other hand, will produce a shallow hollow with worse grip and less drag. Grip determines maneuverability, while less drag allows for greater speed.


The ""radius"" refers to the shape the grinding wheel takes out of skate that's brushed against it. You may remember from geometry class that the radius of a circle is half its width. Think of a circle with a small radius and how that can cut into the end of a rectangle. It can overlap much more than a circle with a larger radius. Thus, smaller radii create much more dramatic edges (a deeper hollow) than the more blunt edges of larger radii (a shallow hollow).Typical starting radii include: 3/8"" for very light skaters, 5/8"" for average skaters, 3/4"" for heavy skaters, and 7/8"" – 1 1/4"" for hockey goalies. Start with these guidelines but tailor your radius to what ends up working best for you.
For increased glide, select a radius of 1"" or higher. For better grip and control, pick one that is 3/8"" or smaller., Change the dresser's position within the dresser arm to achieve the appropriate radius size. In general, you will loosen the diamond's arm grip with a thumbscrew and move the dresser backwards or forwards. The diamond dresser will be marked with lines according to radius size., Press the diamond dresser into the moving grinding wheel for a few seconds. In general, the dresser will be attached to a tool that you will move up and down across the wheel.


The exact method for dressing your wheel, and for machine-sharpening in general, will vary depending on the model you're using. Always consult your machine's user guide and documentation for details.

, Your sharpener will most likely have come with a special skate holder or sharpening jig. Make sure that the blade lines up with the center of the grinding wheel. Use a black marker to color the edge of the blade to serve as a guide.

, Starting with the toe, lightly touch the edge of the blade to the spinning grinding wheel. Move the skate holder so that the entire length of the skate has been run through the grinder. Try to do this as smoothly and consistently as possible to prevent an uneven sharpening. Do this two or three times., If you have successfully sharpened the entire length of the skate, there should no longer be any visible black marking. If there is, do one or more passes until it disappears. Look down the center of your blade to make sure that the hollow is in the middle. If it isn't, adjust the holder to better line the skate up with the wheel and try again.

Realize that blades and boots are sold separately.,
Choose the right boots.,
Ensure that the blade does not have a large toe pick.,
Have the boot fitted properly.,
Take time to break in your new boots.",How to Select a Good Pair of Ice Skates1,";
, For beginners, it is not necessary to have a boot with a lot of padding on the tongue or extra hooks. Three hooks should be enough.

, It is sufficient to have about 3 or 4 picks.

, Check that the heel of the boot fits firmly around your ankle. Your ankle will direct your foot in the curving and turning when you learn this. The boot should also fit firmly from heel to toe.

, This can be hard work and they won't feel very comfortable at first. The answer to this is to break them in in short bursts and build up. Even wearing them around the house or watching TV (with guards on) helps to break them in faster.

Clean the blades and your tools.",How to Sharpen Skates2," You will need a sharpening jig, a large 2-sided sharpening stone, a small burr stone, and a rag to wipe everything down. Look for a jig and stones specifically meant for sharpening skates. These are often sold together as a sharpening set.


You will also need something to lubricate your stone, which will depend on the particular type you use. This will usually be water, some type of oil, or a mixture thereof.
If you are a speed skater, you probably want skates that are completely flat, creating a perfect 90 degree angle with the ice.

, Simply wet your stones with a few drops of the correct lubricant. The lubricant will help to whisk away debris as you sharpen.


If you are using a set of traditional oil-lubricated stones for the first time, you will need to saturate them with oil before their first use. In a plastic container, pour or brush some oil onto one side of the stone. Wait for the stone to absorb the oil before adding some more. Once the oil absorption slows, flip the stone over and repeat the process on the opposite side. Wrap the stones in plastic between sharpenings. This will prevent your stones from becoming clogged with dirty oil., Speed skate sharpening jigs generally hold two skates parallel to each other with clamps. The heel and toe ends of each skate will have their own clamps for a total of four. Different jigs will have different specific instructions. Consult the user manual that came with yours if you aren't sure how to secure your skates properly.


Orient your skates parallel with the blades in the air, as if you were skating upside-down.
The toe end of a jig usually has a guide-plate. Make sure the end of each blade is up against this plate before you finish tightening the clamps.
The exact orientation of your blades isn't as important as maintaining consistency between the right and left sides and across multiple sharpenings. For example, some people place the heel-ends of their blades up against the guide-plate instead of the toe-ends. As long as this is done every time the blades are sharpened, this is a perfectly valid way of mounting a skate.

, When it comes to sharpening skates, ""burrs"" are bits of displaced extra metal that have been pushed to the sides of the blade. Sometimes you will find burrs before you begin to sharpen. If that's the case, remove them with your burr stone.


Position your burr stone flat against the side of the blade with the top of the stone placed slightly past the top of the blade.
Apply steady, even pressure to push your burr stone along the entire length of the blade in one motion.
Repeat these strokes until the burr is removed., Start with the coarse side of the stone facing down and in contact with the blades. Place the stone perpendicular to your skates to form an ""L,"" with the stone far to one end and one side of the two skates.


Which side and which end you start with doesn't matter as long as you stay consistent between sharpening.

, Push the sharpening stone down to the opposite end and side of your skates. Then pull the stone back along the blades to its starting position. Keep the stone perpendicular to your skates the entire time. Repeat this for a total of 20 strokes., Turn the jig around so that the opposite ends of your skates now face you. Do another set of 20 strokes, still pushing and pulling, but in the opposite direction. For example, if you originally went forward and to the left, this time move forward and to the right., A dull blade will make a loud scraping noise even with proper lubrication. As you sharpen, the noise will get quieter and quieter. Keep repeating the sets of 20 strokes, turning the jig and switching directions each time. The duller the blade, the more sets you will have to do to get it sharp., After you've done a few sets, your stone is likely to dry out. If you start to hear a squeaking, ""fingernails on a chalkboard"" noise, add a few more drops of lubricant to the coarse side of your stone. Remember that if you are just starting out on a dull blade, it will make a loud noise regardless of lubrication., Once your strokes start to quiet down, check for burrs. When four distinct burrs have formed, one on either side of each blade, you have finished the grinding process. Keep in mind that a partially-sharpened blade will develop a burr on the outside edge before it does so on the inside.


How many total sets you will need to do will depend on how dull the blade was when you began. A blade that has been recently sharpened may only need a few sets of 2x20, while a very dull skate may need a few dozen., After the burrs have properly formed, lubricate the opposite side of your sharpening stone and flip it over. Position your stone the same way you did to grind your skate down. Do one or two passes of 20 and check that the blade is shiny and smooth. If there are still scratch marks, do another set and check again., Remove your skates from the sharpening jig. Apply steady, even pressure with your burr stone to the entire length of each side of the blades. Repeat until the burr has been removed from all for edges., Wipe the blades down with a clean cloth to remove any stray metal shavings or lubricant. Your skates should now be ready for use.


Use a rag and some additional lubricant to clean off your stones before storing them. Proper maintenance will keep them working for a long time."

,,,,,,,, Go to sleep a little earlier than usual, especially if you are skating in the morning. Set your alarm clock for around an hour to an hour and a half before you'll have to leave the next day.

, Shower if you need to, and then do your regular morning routines. Have a small, healthy breakfast, and don't eat too much. Some is better than none, as you don't want to feel faint before skating. It's a good idea to have some water or juice as well. After that, you can do anything you need or want to do until around twenty or thirty minutes before you will have to go.

, Do not have anything to eat or drink unless you absolutely need to from here until when you are done skating, as you don't want to ruin the dress. You should also do your hair (wear it up; never leave your hair down, unless it's very short, at skating competitions) and make-up now. It's a good idea to still bring along all of your hair items and make-up along, as you will probably want to touch up there.

, Once you are at the rink, register, get your gift bag if they are giving them out, and relax until you have practice ice or your group warm-up. You can talk to other skaters or coaches, watch other programs, explore the rink, or look through the racks of skating items that vendors are usually selling.

, Don't spend time talking to fellow skaters, or working on moves that aren't in your program, especially riskier ones. Run through your program as much as you can. Remember to look up and smile, and time yourself using the stopwatch if you will be having a time limit.

, Use the restroom, spray on some more hairspray, touch up your make-up, brush your teeth... whatever you need! This is a good time to start stretching.

, Hold your stuffed animal or favorite item if you brought one, visualize yourself winning, practice your program on the ground, talk to your coach, jump around to get your jitters out; whatever makes you feel good is fine. Remember to take off your warm-up jacket and gloves and take deep breaths. Believe that you're going to win; a positive attitude helps!

Make sure that there is ample support around the ankle.,
Select the blades according to need.,
Have the blades fitted correctly to your boot.,
Have the blades sharpened.,
Get the skates waterproofed.,
Make sure to purchase guards.,
Keep skates dry after use.",How to Select a Good Pair of Ice Skates2," The skate boot must also prevent most lateral movement. Keep in mind that it should still allow flexing and pointing of the foot as well as bend in the ankle. The front of the boot should be roomy enough so that you can wiggle your toes but should still be snug around the instep and the heel.

, Blades come in many varieties:


Dance blades are shorter on the heel end.
Advanced freestyle blades have large, intricate, intense picks.

, Blades are screwed on, so make sure that you check the screws are securely intact. The blades must sit securely under the physical center of the boot. This is very important because it ensures that the blades will run true across the ice without pulling. Check out the consequences of different fitting:


Blades set too far in - the feet will fall outward
Blades set too far out - the feet will fall inward
Blades correctly centered - feet stand upright naturally


, It is very important that the blades are sharpened. Have them sharpened by someone who specialized in figure skating, not hockey. You will know when to have them sharpened when they start feeling 'slippery' on the ice or you fall out of turns.

, When you first purchase your skates, the shop will either apply a waterproof coat for you or they will tell you to do it yourself. This will keep the sole waterproofed so that it doesn't absorb the water and break down and rot.

, While walking around the rink, it is essential to always wear guards. They come in many different colors and combinations to suit your personality and they protect the blades from undue pressure. They are usually made from plastic.

, As soon as you step off the ice to take off your skates, use an old towel to wipe the water from the boots and blades. Put a ""soaker"" over the blade to protect it. This will ensure that your skates last.

Try thin socks if you don't like your skates to be too tight.,
Try to balance thickness with practicality.",How to Pick Socks for Ice Skating,"

More serious skaters should go to a professional shop and buy skating/dance skin toned tights or socks that are the right thickness and durability for a more serious level.;
, Some skaters prefer tights because the whole leg is covered and the tights can provide more warmth. However, other skaters find tights too constrictive, such as around the waist, or may even find the tights itchy and hot. If you prefer tights, then the rest of the article isn't relevant, and you may wish to read How to pick tights for ice skating instead.,, These can be the perfect combination of height and sufficient thickness as many knee-highs are made with the colder seasons in mind. Try different brands and ask people who have gone skating what they wore., They should be at least at the height of crew cut and preferably higher. Too low and the socks may simply not do what you need them to, namely protect your feet. That said, if you have great inserts in the skating boots, ankle level socks might work and can prevent unsightly sock lines, if that's an issue., If socks are too thick, it may be hard to wear the skates comfortably. On the other hand, if they're too thin, you may damage or hurt your foot due to it not being adequately protected. If renting skates, be on the safe side and stick with long, thick socks."

Skate forward.,

Turn both feet inward.",How to Snowplow Stop in Figure Skating," Skate to the side of the ice rink and hold on tightly with one hand. Stand next to the rink barrier, and have your feet parallel to the barrier siding. Slightly bend your knees and position your feet about 5 inches apart. Put most of your weight on your barrier side foot. With the foot closest to the inside of the ice rink, push your foot away from you, shaving off the top layer of the ice with the inside edge of your skate blade. Move your ice side foot about 6 inches away from your body before bringing it back to center, and pushing it away from your body again.


You will know you are doing this correctly if a pile of shaved ice forms after pushing your foot away from you.Keep your ice side foot straight and parallel to the rink barrier as you push it away from you. Keep your barrier side foot parallel to the rink barrier as well.;
, After snowplowing with one foot, switch the direction you’re facing so that the opposite side of your body is now closest to the rink barrier. For example, if you started out holding the barrier with your right hand and pushing your left foot away from you, turn around and hold the barrier with your left hand, working on snowplowing with your right foot. Again, start with your feet about 5 inches apart and parallel to the rink barrier. Apply most of your weight to your barrier side foot, and gently push your ice side foot away from your body about 6 inches, scraping away the top layer of ice with the inside edge of your skate blade.


Bring your foot back to center and continue practicing the snowplow movement.
A small pile of shaved ice should accumulate from scraping your skate across the ice.

, Now that you’ve practiced snowplowing both feet individually, it’s time to bring it together. While holding onto the rink barrier with one hand, center your body weight evenly between both of your skates, with your feet about 5 inches apart. Slightly bend your knees and push both feet out and away from your center at the same time.Your feet should move away from your center equally, resulting in your feet being about 1 ½ to 2 feet apart.


Bring your feet back into center, and practice a few more times until you can push your feet away from your center swiftly, while keeping your feet parallel.
Again, as you scrape your skates across the ice, small piles of shaved ice should form at the stopping point of your skates.
Be sure to keep your feet parallel to each other as you move them away from your center, or else you might force yourself to move backward.

, Use both of your feet to skate forward, gaining speed. You don’t need to skate too fast, but you do need forward momentum so you can properly snowplow and stop moving.

, When you have gained enough speed, stop moving your feet, slightly bend your knees, and glide forward with your feet parallel to each other.At this point, shift your body weight to one of your feet. The foot you shift your weight to is going to be the foot you keep straight as you perform your one-footed snowplow with the other foot.


Consider shifting your weight to your non-dominant foot as you first practice the one-footed snowplow. For example, if you are a righty, try shifting your weight to your left foot, and perform the snowplow with your right foot.

, This stop is also called the T-stop.As you’re gliding forward with your feet parallel and your body weight on one foot, turn your other foot inward. As you turn your foot inward (pointing your toes in and pushing your heel out), slightly push that foot away from your body, keeping your other foot straight. Your slanted, turned in foot will snowplow with the inside edge of your skate blade, causing you to slow down and stop.


Be sure to keep the foot you’re turning inward close to your body as you push it away. You only need to push it about 6 inches away from your center to start slowing down.
If you push that foot out too far from your body, you’ll lose control and over stretch your leg, possibly injuring yourself.It may help to have your hands extended out to your sides for balance.

, Use both of your feet to accelerate and gain some speed. You don’t have to go very fast, you just need to be moving forward so you can practice snowplowing and stopping.

, Stop using your feet to skate forward and let yourself glide, keeping your skates straight and parallel to each other. Slightly bend your knees, and shift your body weight to the center of your body, not leaning too much on one side or the other.


Your weight needs to be very centralized in order to stop correctly, and not fall forward or backward.

, As you’re are gliding forward, turn both of your feet inward (pointing your toes in and pushing your heels out) to look pigeon-toed, or create an upside down letter ""V"". As you turn your feet inward, also push your feet slightly away from your body, letting your inner skate blades snowplow the ice. You should come to a stop.


Be careful to not shift your weight forward or backward as you snowplow. If you do, you may end up falling on your back or front.
If you are pushing your feet out from the center of your body but are still moving forward and not stopping, you maybe leaving your feet parallel to each other rather than turning them inward.Keep practicing, being sure to turn both of your feet inward.
The snowplowing is going to occur when your inner skate blade creates friction with the ice, gently shaving off the top layer of ice.
Again, it may be helpful to keep your arms raised at your sides for added balance.

Select the right rack.,
Focus on form.,
Get close.,
Aim middle low.,
Shoot down the middle.,
Learn from your mistakes.",How to Break a Rack in Pool," The type of pool rack is a very important aspect of the outcome of your break. The tighter the rack, the better the break.;
, Put extra power into the shot by pulling back farther, not by shooting faster. You want a smooth, controlled backswing with full follow-through. A steady, square impact carries more force than a lightning-fast shank.

, Beginners often rest their stick on the back rail. On a regulation table, that puts you too far away. Learn to break from the head-string (the closest point you can be to the rack), with a closed bridge (the hand position that looks like a rotated ""OK"" sign).

, Go for a full hit in the middle of the cue ball, just below center, so it dies after contact. You want the cue ball to come to rest in the middle of the table so you'll have lots of options for your second shot.

, Some players aim for the second row of balls, hoping to bounce the cue ball off a rail and back into the rack for more action. Whatever. A full hit on the head ball equals a stronger, more consistent break with fewer scratches.

, Watch the cue ball to fine-tune your shot. If it tends to drive forward after impact, hit it lower for more backspin. If it likes to veer off toward the sides, hit it slower for greater accuracy and power.

Warm up every session by skating around the rink.,
Skate more frequently, if you can.,
Investigate adult-specific skating classes.,
Try private lessons, if you can.",How to Overcome Fear As a Beginner Figure Skater," Skating does tend to be unsteady, and you will fall often when first learning to skate, and also when learning new elements (moves), especially jumps.;
, Watch videos of Olympic skaters -- plenty of them fall during their programs, and they're usually well enough to get up immediately and continue.

, The reason most falls don't result in injury is that skaters are used to falling.


Most learn to skate programs cover this in the first lesson. You simply do a ""dip"" (squat) and then drop onto your backside.

, Falling means you're learning. Let go. If you really let go of all feelings, you will be a swan on ice.


In any fall, try to avoid hitting your head.

, This will also reduce the risk of injury, and also increase your confidence.


Check your skates' (whether rented or your own) fit. Get a skate fitter to do this -- if you're buying skates, the skate shop owner can guide you, and for rentals the skate hire desk may be able to help.
If the blades on the rental skates are very blunt, they will be difficult to skate in. If possible, get your own skates (new or used) so that you can use sharp blades.
Avoid skating in loose-fitting pants. Leggings or stockings are better, as you can catch your blades in loose jeans or trousers, resulting in a potentially dangerous, tangled fall.
Consider wearing body protection such as a helmet and/or knee pads. Although figure skaters don't wear helmets in competition, if you're not competing this is not a worry. Even if you do eventually want to compete, consider wearing a helmet while beginning (although practice skating without the helmet before the competition).
Other body protection available includes hip, wrist and tailbone protection, which you can buy online or in skate shops.

, If it's your first time, don't worry if you hold onto the barrier for some, most or even all of the session.

, The barrier can be useful for practising some moves (such as turns, glides, crossovers and waltz jumps), however, it can also become a crutch to learning to do them independently.


Set limits on barrier use. For example, ""I'm going to practise my three turn five times at the barrier, then go and do it without support.""
Be careful using the barrier. It can be dangerous. If you're not actively holding the barrier, it is probably safer to skate further away from it -- you have almost no chance of grabbing it during a fall, and you're likely to hit it and get injured worse than if you'd fallen unobstructed in the middle of the ice.
Basically, don't skate near the barrier as a support unless you are actually holding onto it.

, Can't do crossovers because you're too nervous? Practise your outside edge glides, crossovers standing still, and crossovers holding the barrier (see notes on barrier use above).


Don't worry if you can do something one day, but can't do it the next time you skate. Try practising the preliminary steps to build your confidence.

, This helps you get the ""feel"" of the ice, especially if you haven't skated for a while.

, This is depending on where you want to go with skating. If you just want to be able to let go of the barrier and keep up with your friends during public skate, you don't need to skate every day or even every week to achieve that. However, if you're aiming to do eventually jumps and compete, you may need to skate a few times a week.


If you've just learnt a new element and you're worried about ""losing"" it due to lack of confidence, try to skate as soon as possible after it. For example, if you learn your three turn on Monday, and you usually wouldn't skate again until Friday, you could try to skate on Tuesday or Wednesday (if possible).

, If you're over 18, your rink might offer lessons especially for adult beginners. There won't be kids skating around you fast, and the lesson may be more empty. The coach will probably be understanding that starting skating can be more scary for adults and older teens, as they are more aware of risks.

, It's not necessary if you're only skating recreationally, but one-on-one lessons can help with confidence.


If you can't do private lessons, investigate the different group classes available. Many rinks offer beginner skating on multiple days, and you might find, for example, that weekday afternoon lessons are often emptier than the weekend classes. If you can get to the less crowded class, you'll get less crowded ice and more attention.

, This will cause your body to rotate. If you are a left handed skater, stand in the same position, but with your right hand in front of you and your left to your side. Pull your left hand to your right.

Once you have gotten to the point where you can do one full revolution (360 degrees), practice doing the actual jump off ice.
For right handed skaters, put your left foot in front of your right, in the loop jump takeoff position. Jump up in the air, rotate, and come down on your right leg. Make sure to land on your landing foot, so that you get used to the feeling.
If you are a left handed skater, then do the opposite, but be sure to maintain the loop position.

, This jump can be a bit tricky as you do not land on your normal ""landing-leg"".

Start in your loop takeoff position, then jump up in the air and do a full revolution. Come down on an inside edge on your non-landing leg.

, You will want to be able to land it consistently before you start tweaking it. Start in your loop takeoff position and jump in the air, pulling your arms together. Do one revolution in the air and come down on your landing leg. When you land, put your arms straight out and stretch your leg in a nice landing position., Are you rushing? Are you on your toepick? Are your legs too far apart? Make sure you hit the correct position while in the air, and find the perfect speed for you., This is a tough position, since the force of jumping can cause your legs to be a bit far apart or too close together.

Make sure your legs are in an ""h"" position, with one leg bent slightly at the knee. Make sure that the blade of your free leg is at around the mid-calf of your landing leg. Try to make your body look like a lower-case h, with one leg bent forming the curve, and the other straight forming the stem.

Get up.",How to Do the RKO Like Randy Orton," The RKO is performed on standing opponents - this move can't be effectively performed on people who are sitting, kneeling, or lying down because it deals damage by causing your opponent to fall on his face from a standing position. The RKO also requires your opponent to be facing you.


In the ring, Randy Orton doesn't always wait for an opponent to face him before delivering a deadly RKO. Often, he'll turn a dazed opponent to face him, then perform a modified standing RKO (as opposed to the ""normal"" RKO, which requires space to run).
This bears repeating: never perform the RKO on someone who is unaware of what the move entails or doesn't understand the risks involved. Remember that professional wrestling is staged, practiced, and, to a certain extant, choreographed. The RKO, even when performed perfectly, can cause serious injury. Performed carelessly, this risk exponentially increases.;
, Though several variations on the basic RKO exist, the most common, well-known version starts with Randy Orton taking a running start towards his opponent. This can be done from a standing start or as a rebound maneuver off of the turnbuckle. Give yourself enough space to gain decent speed - you don't need to be sprinting, but you do need to be running fast enough to get inside your opponent's defenses without giving him a chance to block or dodge.


Remember that moves like the RKO are performed by professional wrestlers so that they'll look devastating but will actually result in no lasting injury. wikiHow strongly recommends gently walking through this move, rather than performing it at full speed.

, As you near your opponent at running speed, jump towards him while turning around. Your goal is to make contact between your upper back and your opponent's upper torso and catch his head on the shoulder of your dominant arm. As you leap and turn away from your opponent, raise your hands in preparation to grab your opponent's head.


Running directly at anyone - experienced wrestler or not - is dangerous and can lead to serious injury. Take all necessary precautions to ensure your safety, as well as your opponent's.

, As you make contact with your opponent, grab his head and cradle it with your dominant arm above your shoulder. His head should rest fairly comfortably against the front of your shoulder or upper chest. Rest your non-dominant hand against the back of your opponent's head - the goal is to give the impression that you're gripping it firmly without actually applying any force.


Disclaimer: Never, ever, perform this step (or any step after this one) at full speed. Violently jerking or twisting someone's neck can cause crippling, debilitating spinal injury. The RKO is meant to look like it can break an opponent's neck - with only a relatively small mistake, it can.

, As soon as you make contact with your opponent and grab his head, lift your feet up and begin to fall. Your goal is to get nearly, if not completely, horizontal. At the end of a successful RKO, you will be lying face-up on your back.


At this point, your opponent should also try to get horizontal in the air. However, since he'll be facing down, he'll need to kick his legs back as he falls forward.

, Release your non-dominant hand's hold on the back of your opponent's head. Your opponent's head should now be gently cradled between the crook of your dominant arm and the front of your shoulder. Allow your opponent to discretely brace himself as he makes contact with the mat by landing on his hands and elbows, which he should tuck beneath his chest. Also allow your opponent to adjust the position of his head in your grip so that his neck won't hit your arm as you land.


With these safety measures, your opponent is less likely to be hurt, but accidents happen. Never perform this move without a partner who knows how to keep himself from being hurt and understands the risks involved.

, The final portion of an RKO looks seriously painful - as if you are forcing your opponent to land face-first on the mat while simultaneously forcing his neck down onto your arm. However, in this case, looks are deceiving. If everything goes perfectly, your opponent will land on his hands, elbows, and/or knees, rather than his or her face or neck, avoiding any injury besides a few minor scrapes.


Your opponent can sell his impact by ""bouncing"" off of the floor, mimicking the flopping motion of a body that's been slammed into the floor.

, Success! You have just performed the Randal Keith Orton (RKO)! If your opponent is KO, then you can now take advantage of the situation by attempting to quickly pin him.

Continue training.",How to Break Into Professional Wrestling," If you want to become a professional wrestler, you have to learn how to wrestle properly. Do an online search to find wrestling schools in your area. Look for schools that are run by former professional wrestlers. Additionally, these schools should have former students that have gotten into the WWE or the TNA.Ask questions such as:


“How much does it cost to attend your school?”
“Have any of your graduates ever joined the WWE or the TNA?”
“Does the instructor have professional wrestling experience?”
If possible, find a school that hosts matches for the trainees. This will give you valuable performing experience.;
, If you want to be a professional wrestler, you have to be strong. Build and maintain your muscle mass by eating a lot of protein. Eat one gram of protein daily for every pound of body mass that you have. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, you should eat at least 160 grams of protein every day.Greek yogurt (23 grams of protein per serving), whey protein powder (24 grams of protein per scoop), ground beef (18 grams of protein per serving), and chicken breasts (24 grams per serving) are all high in protein.
For example, if you ate two chicken breasts, a cup of broccoli, and drank a protein shake for lunch, you would have eaten 74.6 grams of protein.

, These exercises build your muscles and increase your strength.Strength training exercises usually involve repetitive lifting of heavy weights. For example, bicep curls are a strength exercise that builds up your biceps. Other examples include:



Deadlifts to increase your overall strength

Push ups to build upper-body strength

Calf raises to improve your leg strength

, Many people who want to build muscles skip cardio training because they think it’s unnecessary. However, it will increase your endurance and help you stay active for long periods of time. If you do cardio often, you won’t get tired out quickly when you’re wrestling.Cardio exercises include:


Running on a treadmill
Going for a jog
Using an exercise bike

, Professional wrestlers often use a persona while competing. First, choose whether you’ll be a “good guy” or a “bad guy.” Next, create a heavily exaggerated personality for your character. For example, if you’re a bad guy, you could be a loud, angry clown with an unreasonable love for flamingos.


Give your character a crazy backstory to help you craft a memorable persona.
Alternatively, create your persona by exaggerating aspects of your existing personality.For example, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson plays a more intense version of himself on stage.

, Your character’s name should reflect their personality.Think of what kinds of names would be meaningful to your character. For example, the angry, flamingo-loving clown might be called “Pinkie.” Other great names include:


“The Ogre” for a large, unpleasant-looking bad guy
“Sir Lancelot” for a charming, medieval-themed good guy
“Earthquake” for a large, powerful man of few words.

, Many famous wrestlers have signature movements that set them apart from their peers. Stand out from the crowd by inventing character-specific poses that you can strike throughout a wrestling match.For example:


“The Ogre” might shout insults at the crowd every time he hurts the “good guy”
“Sir Lancelot” may throw roses out into the crowd as he enters the ring
“Earthquake” might stomp his feet and yell before each match

, Contact a wrestling outfit manufacturer when you’re ready to choose an outfit. Do an online search to find a manufacturer or talk to your instructor for recommendations. These manufacturers will be able to help you design a good outfit based off of your name and your persona. However, be prepared to wait a few weeks for your costume to be finished.


These costumes are often expensive. However, if you use a ready-made costume, your look won’t be unique or memorable.

, Many professional wrestlers and coaches advise serious wrestlers to move to the U.S. state of Florida.Orlando, FL is the home of the WWE Performance Center and has a huge wrestling circuit. If you’re lucky, you may meet a great booking agent or get to wrestle against a developing WWE wrestler.


A developing WWE wrestler is a wrestler that is being considered for the WWE. Any match they compete in will be watched by WWE officials.

, Attend as many wrestling shows in Orlando as you can. Make an effort to talk with any booking agents, trainers, or wrestlers that you see. This is called networking. Many professional wrestlers believe that knowing the right people can open doors that would otherwise be closed to you.For example, if you meet a trainer and they like you, they may call you if a show opens up.

, A manager, also known as a booking agent, will help you find wrestling matches and work to further your career. Do an online search to find reputable agencies in your area. Alternatively, talk to your wrestling instructor or an experienced wrestler for help finding a good manager.


It may be hard to get a good manager early on in your career. If so, continue finding matches on your own to build a name for yourself.
Avoid people who want to take advantage of you. For example, don’t give a stranger money to book you., The best way to become a famous wrestler is to draw attention to yourself. There are many social media websites that are the perfect platform for online attention. First, create a professional Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Next, stay active on your social media accounts to keep your audience interested in what you have to say. For example:


Post some lighthearted jokes to make your fans laugh.
Create posts announcing your upcoming matches and their results.
Post pictures of yourself in your wrestling outfit on your Instagram. Use a variety of poses to make the pictures interesting.

, Keep yourself in peak physical condition by lifting weights, doing cardio, and participating in wrestling matches. To participate in matches, join a wrestling gym or wrestling club. Alternatively, talk to wrestling venues and tell them that you’re willing to wrestle for free. This will give you a great training session as well as performing experience.


Find wrestling gyms near you by doing an online search or talking to a trainer.

Educate wrestlers about concussions.",How to Reduce Concussion Risk for Wrestlers1," No matter the skill level of the wrestler, he should still wear something to protect his head while wrestling. Wearing the proper headgear can help protect against head injuries.Some people believe that the headgear is too bulky or gets in the way. Wrestlers should try to learn how to wrestle with the headgear despite of that because it can reduce the risk of injury.
Helmets and headgear don’t completely protect someone from getting a concussion. However, they help reduce the risk.;
, If wrestlers don’t already wear a mouth guard while wrestling, they should consider using one. A recent study has shown that wearing properly fitting mouth guards can help reduce the risk of concussions.Mouth guards are supposed to help absorb shock from a blow to the head, help stabilize the head and neck, and help reduce head injury due to a blow to the jaw.
Wrestlers should consider getting a fitted mouth guard from a dentist instead of buying one at a sports store. Custom mouth guards are thicker, which is more effective at protecting the person wearing it. They also fit the mouth better, so they are more comfortable.

, Following the rules of the match helps protect the wrestler and his opponent during a match. That means wrestlers should refrain from being overly aggressive or trying to get away with illegal moves.Some moves have been made illegal because of their tendency to cause concussions. For example, USA Wrestling banned the reverse lift for all but the best wrestlers because it caused more head injuries than other moves.Wrestling in an aggressive or wild way without thinking about proper form and technique can lead to head injuries., Proper education can help reduce the risk of concussions, especially for younger wrestlers. Coaches should get a physician to talk to the team or organization about the seriousness of concussions.During this session, the physician can help make the wrestlers, coaches, parents, and trainers aware of initial concussion side effects, along with ones that show up 12 to 48 hours afterwards.
Wrestlers should also be taught the effects of multiple concussions and wrestling with a concussion.

Lastly, never give up!",How to Wrestle," With almost every sport comes equipment or clothes associated with that sport. Things you'll need will be listed below.;
, Start from a standing position. Then, separate your feet slightly so you can fit an average sized pillow in between them. Then, bend your knees and arch your back. Lastly, put your hands in front of you.

, Widening your legs will help with this. You want to make it very difficult for someone to topple you over. Keep your weight spread between both of your feet. Stay on the balls of your feet.

, First, get into your stance. Second, lower your level and take a step with your lead foot. Third, fall to your dominant leg's knee and drag your non-dominant leg through and come to a knee with your non-dominant leg. If you are a right handed, you should end up on your right knee. Although, once you've been wrestling for awhile you may develop a neutral stance and not necessarily have a lead foot, but you don't worry about it. Just make sure your comfortable and balanced in your stance.

, If you don't understand a move get help from someone who does, and watch it being done slowly and attempt it slowly to perfect technique, then speed it up.

, Start from your stance, then shoot into your partner with a drop-step. Your ""power leg"" or leading leg should be on the inside of your partners legs and your non-dominant leg should be on outside. Your right hand should be grasped onto your opponents left gastrocnemius muscle (the back of their thigh) and your left hand should be on the right one. If you are strong enough to lift your opponent, then do so and dig your head into your opponents hip and drive him that way. If you are not strong enough, then still drive your opponent with your head on his hip, he will eventually fall if performed correctly.

, Sprawling is simply falling to your hip from your stance. It moves your legs out of range from someone shooting on you. Simply drop from your stance and land on your partner with your hip on his back. Like everything else in wrestling, practice this over and over again. This is the best way to defend an opponents, and opens the best options to counter-attack.

, Your coach should have a weight class chart.

, Find articles on wrestling such as this and read through them. There are many videos online. Watch and study them. Most of the best wrestlers have studied hours of film (videos). Practice what they tell you.

Focus on wrestling fundamentals.,
Learn proper takedown techniques.,
Learn how to land.,
Strengthen the neck and shoulder muscles.",How to Reduce Concussion Risk for Wrestlers2," Learning proper wrestling fundamentals is key to preventing concussions. Many concussions occur because of head injuries resulting when a head connects with another head, a knee, or the mat. All wrestlers should be instructed in proper wrestling fundamentals.Learning how to attack in a controlled manner and mastering the proper form of the moves can help protect the wrestler and his opponent.

, Another way to help reduce the risk of concussions in wrestlers and their opponents is for them to learn proper takedown techniques. This helps wrestlers avoid giving someone else a concussion.There are numerous takedown techniques. As the wrestlers learn them, make sure to they learn how to perform the moves while not using the head and protecting the head.The wrestlers should learn how to avoid getting hit in the head. Learning how to wrestle where one doesn’t go head-first into the move can help eliminate head-to-head or head-to-knee injuries.
Wrestlers should keep a proper stance when they are going into a takedown. Using the proper stance helps protect the head.Coaches should teach and emphasize proper takedown techniques. They should also teach athletes how to perform moves and wrestle without going in head first.

, Learning how to land on the mat is just as important as learning how to attack. Every wrestler will be thrown to the mat, and wrestlers learning to land properly can help reduce the risk of concussion.When a wrestler lands, his supports should be wide and extended. He should ever land with his arms back and down. His hips should be parallel to the floor and positioned lower than his head.Coaches should make sure all wrestlers are taught to properly land and protect themselves from head injury.

, Studies have shown that strengthening neck and shoulder muscles can help prevent concussions. Focusing on strength training moves that build muscles in the shoulders and neck may help absorb some of the impact if hit in the head.Increasing neck strength can help lower the risk of your brain rattling around in the skull, which leads to concussions.
To do an easy neck exercise, a wrestler can start by putting his hands on the back of his head. He should press the hands forward as he pushes his neck backwards. The resistance helps strengthen the neck."

Put a plan into place for concussions.,
Recognize common initial concussion symptoms.,
Remove the wrestler from the match.,
Allow the wrestler to compete only after he’s medically cleared.,
Think about the wrestler’s overall health.",How to Reduce Concussion Risk for Wrestlers3," One of the most important things coaches and trainers can do for wrestling concussions is to put a plan into place to deal with concussions when they happen. This plan needs to be laid out before a concussion occurs. Having a plan in place prior to a match or practice helps eliminate potentially harmful decisions being made based on match score or heated emotions.The athletic trainer should be the person to put the plan into place and make sure it is properly carried out.
Action plans may include evaluations a trainer can give the wrestler to make sure he does not have a concussion. These evaluations may include a standardized assessment of concussion (SAC) or a balance error scoring system (BESS). They may give important details about whether the wrestler should continue or not.

, Research has shown that only roughly 10% of concussions result in a loss of consciousness. To reduce any serious concussion-related injuries, coaches, athletes, and trainers need to know the initial concussion symptoms so they can make a proper judgement about their athlete.While coaches and trainers need to help make decisions about concussions, especially in young wrestlers, the wrestler needs to be aware of any symptoms. If the wrestler experiences the symptoms, he should let the coach knows and stop competing. Competing with a concussion can lead to serious damage.
These symptoms include dizziness, loss of balance, headache, fatigue, disorientation, slurred speech, amnesia, vomiting, or ringing of the ears.

, If the wrestler is suspected to have sustained a concussion, he should be removed from the match. The athlete should then be taken to a doctor to be checked out.Serious damage may occur to a wrestler if he continues to compete with a concussion. Wrestling with a concussion may lead to brain hemorrhage or swelling, in addition to other problems.

, No matter the state of a match or competition, the wrestler’s health is the top priority. This means that he should not be allowed to compete again until he heals from his concussion.Symptoms may subside and the wrestler may feel fine, but he may not be medically ready to compete again. Coaches should only allow a wrestler to return to competing after he is discharged by a medical professional., Many wrestlers have the attitude to keep going despite hardships. This may lead to better wrestling and wins. However, when a wrestler has a concussion, this go get ‘em philosophy will not work. Parents, coaches, and the wrestler should think about long-term health instead of immediate goals, like getting back to training, finishing a match, or getting back on the mat.Concussions may seem mild now, but repeated concussions may cause extreme difficulties later in life. These difficulties include permanent brain damage, memory loss, and even depression.
Parents and coaches should be especially mindful of young wrestlers. Wrestlers who are seven, ten, or even thirteen might not understand the severity of their injuries and want to get back onto the mat. Instead, parents and coaches need to put the wrestler’s health first and make sure he gets the proper recovery before going back out there again.

Attend a UFC tryout.",How to Become an Ultimate Fighter," Ultimate fighting, or mixed martial arts, is a test of aerobic endurance, strength, agility, and willpower. You have to be an all-around great athlete to be an ultimate fighter, so if it's your ambition to jump into the cage, you need to get in shape.



Build muscle and lose fat, rather than attempting to diet and lose lots of weight. You want to build bulk and be strong. Developing a healthy lifting routine and aerobic routine to get into good fighting shape will make transitioning into training much easier.
If you don't have the time to get to the gym, work out at home. Ease into a comprehensive routine of running, push-ups, sit-ups, and stretching.;
, Ultimate fighters are a cross between boxers, martial artists, wrestlers, and almost any style of fighting under the sun. One of the most widely-available and comprehensive ways to start learning fighting skills at any age is to start developing boxing skills, learning to throw a punch and play defense while upright.

, If you're young and just starting out, consider joining your school's wrestling team to get a good foundation in mat wrestling and get experience fighting in a controlled environment. It might not be as flashy as what happens in the UFC, but learning the fundamentals of amateur wrestling will make you a stronger fighter in the long run, building your mat skills and your endurance. It's also a great way to keep tabs on your weight and get into good fighting shape., When you're first trying to get into MMA, it'll help if you've got some experience (even at the beginner level) with basic mat wrestling and some variety of martial art. You can jump right in and start learning MMA basics, but being a well-rounded fighter who's able to take the fight to the ground as well as out-box your opponent is the difference between being a great fighter and a mediocre one.The best martial arts to familiarize yourself with for MMA include:


Karate and kung-fu are excellent for learning accuracy in your kicks
Judo is a great way to learn to get your opponent on the mat
Brazilian ju-jitsu is studied by the most successful MMA fighters, and takes mat fighting to a whole other level
Muay-thai is also known as the ""art of eight limbs"" and specializes in the use of knees and elbows for striking

, Learning to fight properly in the cage will take more than learning a bunch of martial arts individually and then picking a fight. You've got to learn to put it all together and train with other MMA fighters, sparring, learning, and developing your skills. You'll learn the basics and have a good resource in the community that gathers around these types of gyms.

, There are many different styles of ultimate fighters, from technical boxers to street fighters to mat wrestlers to masters of the kick. What comes most naturally to you? To become a great mixed martial artist, you need to identify your speciality and work to hone that skill into a razor-sharp point that you can use against your opponents.


Partially, this may develop out of other skills you've built prior to training in mixed martial arts. If you're a wrestler, develop your mat game, also working on your boxing to become a more rounded fighter. If you started out boxing, consider training in Brazilian style to develop your mat game. Be a complete fighter.

, You need to find your healthy weight at the upper range of one of the scales, then maintain a consistent weight at that level.Mixed martial arts and the UFC generally use the following weight classes to classify fighters:


Bantamweight: 126 to 135 lb (57 to 61 kg)
Featherweight: 136 to 145 lb (62 to 66 kg)
Lightweight: 146 to 155 lb (66 to 70 kg)
Welterweight: 156 to 170 lb (71 to 77 kg)
Middleweight: 171 to 185 lb (78 to 84 kg)
Light Heavyweight: 186 to 205 lb (84 to 93 kg)
Heavyweight: 206 to 265 lb (93 to 120 kg).

, Once you've got some experience training under your belt, ask one of your trainers to hook you up with a fight locally and get a feel for what competing in MMA is like. If it goes well and you like it, continue booking fights as often as your training schedule permits. Trust your trainer to find a good match against someone with a similar skill level.


Bookers often like to book shark-fish fights, pairing an inexperienced fish (in this case, you) with a killer fighter in the hopes of packing the house to see a bloodbath. Try your best to avoid being thrust into one of these types of situations for your first fight. It would be discouraging to have to compete against a much more experienced fighter.

, When you start competing, learn to block out the losses and the wins alike. Always look forward to your next fight, pausing only briefly to consider your victories and your failures in the ring. Dwelling on your past fights is only good for learning what you can do better and how you can improve to increase your chances of being victorious in your next fight.

, Keep working hard in the gym and utilizing the training you receive. Surround yourself with a good training team, including other more experienced fighters and trainers who'll help you identify the areas in which you need to improve. Work on becoming the best all-around fighter you can be and keep winning fights.

, Get online and start building a presence for yourself as an amateur fighter. Get your name out there. Attend UFC fights and make contacts in the sport, join message boards and participate as much as you can in the community. If you want to become a professional mixed martial artist, you've got to make your life revolve around the sport.


Tapology and Fight Network are popular resources for fighters and fans of MMA. Interact and learn everything you can.
Participate in social networking sites including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Promote your own fights and appearances, and stay in touch with your fighting contacts and your fans.

, If you've built a good reputation and record for yourself as an amateur fighter, approach a management company like Fight Tribe or Made to Win, companies that have a proven track record of managing fighters. Try to negotiate a management deal with them.


It's important to understand that most management companies will only be interested in winners. Keep winning a number of key fights against strong opponents. They want to find experienced and exciting fighters they stand to profit from, not wanna-be's with considerable talent. Give yourself the best chance by winning as many fights as possible.

, Mike Tyson had his clanging chains and Muhammad Ali had his rhymes. In the MMA world, Chuck Liddell had his mohawk and trash talking, while Anderson Silva had his ice-man demeanor. You're going to need to stand out in the field and start cultivating a flamboyant and entertaining persona if you want to stand out among the fighting crowd.


This comes easier to some fighters than others. Don't spend time doing your hair and getting scary-looking tattoos. That time would be better spent training. Still, it's worth giving some thought to your ""character."" Earn a scary nickname and use it.

, If your ultimate goal is to become an Ultimate Fighter, you need to try out for the UFC. Invite representatives to your fights and get in touch. Let it be known that you want in. The organization works basically like an exclusive club--you have to be invited. But there's no harm in making it clear that you're interested.


You could also consider applying for The Ultimate Fighter reality show, which generally holds tryouts in a specific destination once a year.They'll sometimes limit it to a particular weight class or region to accommodate the particular theme of the show, but keep regularly checking in as you build your fight schedule and keep winning.

These are independent wrestling promotions, college football programs, and college wrestling teams.


The Rock, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Bray Wyatt and Roman Reigns all got their start on the football field, not in the squared circle.
Other notable stars including Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Dolph Ziggler, started out as skilled amateur wrestlers before signing deals with WWE.
Wrestlers like CM Punk, Chris Jericho, Seth Rollins, and The Hardy Boyz didn't come from athletic backgrounds. Instead, they received training at private wrestling schools, then joined indy wrestling promotions and got good enough to get WWE's attention.;
, How did Ryback get so ripped? Hitting the weights at the age of 12.WWE wrestlers need to be strong enough to pick up a 200+ pound brawler and slam him to the mat safely. Even if you want to be a high-flyer or a mat-wrestler, you need to be strong. Focus on building strength in your upper body, your core, and your legs.


While wrestlers used to look like beer-drinking bar-room brawlers, most wrestlers these days have bodybuilder muscles. It takes serious commitment to diet and exercise if you want to be in the WWE.
Join a gym and consult a personal trainer if you want to get into WWE shape. Wrestler Triple H also offers a strength and conditioning workout video series you can buy commercially., Running around the ring between the ropes, landing flat on your back, and doing hip-tosses That's hard. Wrestling will have you gasping for breath pretty quick if you're not in shape. Pro wrestlers need to be in excellent cardio condition, ready to go 10-20 minutes per match at a fast clip.


Try grouping your favorite 5-10 strength workouts and do them in short, timed bursts to introduce some cardio to your strength-training routine. Do as many reps as you can with a manageable weight in 60 seconds, then give yourself 15 seconds of rest before moving to the next workout. Do all 10 exercises before taking a two minutes break, then repeat the circuit twice.
Former pro wrestler ""Diamond"" Dallas Page leads a wrestling-themed yoga workout that's available commercially, involving low-impact flexibility and cardio exercise. Lots of wrestlers use his method in their training.

, Pro wrestling is about learning to move with other people, to make the contest look realistic. Moonsaults, bodyslams, and hurricanranas are a lot more like dancing than they are like actual wrestling. You won't see anyone come off the top rope in an amateur contest or do an RKO, so gymnastics and dance are good ways to get coordinated.


Learning to tumble and take bumps will be part of your wrestling training, but you'll be a much faster learner if you've got experience doing flips and learning to spot yourself. It's an excellent way to build a foundation.

, The Rock didn't become a movie star by accident. Wrestlers have to be great actors, learning to sell moves and tell a convincing and compelling story in the ring. Even if you've got a ripped bod and a killer finishing move, nobody's going to care if you can't talk on the microphone.


Promos used to be improvised in the days of the Hulkster. Now, memorizing lines is a part of the routine in the WWE. If you want to be on TV, you're going to have to learn to read a script and memorize your lines.

, A common joke among pro wrestlers is that they eat nothing but grilled chicken breasts, steamed broccoli, and brown rice. Even though you might be on the road 300 days a year, it's not going to be all hamburgers and french fries. You've got to commit to eating a diet rich in lean proteins, vitamin-rich vegetables, and slow-digesting carbohydrates, to keep your body working for you.

, Learning to do pro wrestling moves needs to happen in person, taught by a wrestling instructor in a proper wrestling ring. Wrestling schools and academies are available in most regions, offering 6-week courses and other packages for interested wrestlers. The best of these will sometimes be offered spots in local promotions.


Lots of notable wrestling schools are run by former wrestlers. Shawn Michaels, Lance Storm, Devon and Bubba Ray Dudley, Harley Race, and Killer Kowalski all run esteemed wrestling schools in the US, from which many WWE superstars have graduated.
Likewise, many indie promotions like Ring of Honor and Ohio Valley Wrestling also offer training programs.
Never, under any circumstances, should you start practicing the wrestling moves you see on television, when you're at home. Done incorrectly, those moves can be deadly.

, The big secret to those devastating moves that look like they really hurt? They actually really hurt. Pro wrestlers learn to fall properly, however, to control those falls and protect their heads and necks from more serious injury. While landing flat on your back will never feel great, in training you'll learn to do it safely. Other skills you'll learn in wrestling school involve:


Locking up
Striking
Running the ropes
Chain wrestling
Taking specific moves
Communicating in the ring
Selling other wrestlers' moves

, Like a good movie, a good wrestling match isn't all shoot-outs and love scenes, even though those might be the best parts. Matches need to be paced properly, mixing high spots and low spots to create drama for the audience. Learning how to do this is one of the most difficult but important parts of learning the art of wrestling.


Contrary to popular belief, most wrestling matches aren't actually scripted move-for-move. Lots of the bigger spots and the finish is usually planned out, but getting from point A to point B will usually be called in the ring.Talk to older and more experienced wrestlers. Take every opportunity to work with them yourself if you want to learn about match pacing. Most beginners rush, going from move to move pretty quickly. Slowing down is a skill that you'll gain with time and effort.

, Pro wrestling characters are usually flamboyant, over-the-top, larger-than-life personas. Regular guys named Terry and James became Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior when they set foot in the ring. Connect with a crowd by developing a kind of character they'll be able to relate to if you're a babyface, or despise if you're a heel.


Good characters are usually just amplified versions of your real personality. John Cena could really freestyle rap before he became the Doctor of Thuganomics, and Chris Jericho, the Ayatollah of Rock 'n Rolla, really is the singer in a band.
Character traits are sometimes called ""gimmicks"" in pro wrestling. Even if you're wrestling under your regular name, you need a good gimmick or prop. Think of Bret Hart's leather jacket and pink sunglasses, or Shawn Michaels' sparkly chaps.

, Remember: The wins and losses don't matter. Wrestlers aren't always great because they're the best wrestlers. Some of them just talk so charismatically, they get you to believe they are. Study the work of some promo masters, like Ric Flair, The Rock, Chris Jericho, Paul Heyman, and Randy Savage to learn how to talk smack with the best of them.


Practice talking in front of the mirror, perfecting the mannerisms and movements of your character. Become someone else and commit to as wide a range of emotions as possible.Good catchphrases are important for wrestlers, but cutting an intense promo about your upcoming match is even more important. You can practice promos any time. Pick a wrestler you hate and practice talking in the mirror. Talk how you're going to rip his head off this coming Sunday. Make it intense. Make it entertaining.

, Being a good pro wrestler isn't about winning the most matches, or being the strongest person in the world. It's about getting the crowd interested in your matches enough to want to see you win, or lose. It's a performance, and sometimes the performance won't involve you getting the win.


Pro wrestlers usually work as ""heels"" or ""babyfaces."" If you're a heel, your job is to make the crowd hate you so much they'll pay good money to see you get a beat-down. If you're a babyface, your job is to be sympathetic with the crowd, so they'll want to see you do the beating. Not everyone can be a babyface.
Some wrestlers do pretty much nothing but lose. When you first get started, you'll probably be doing ""jobs"" for more experienced wrestlers. It's a great opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the business. Try to keep your ego out of it.

, WWE wrestlers need to be fans of the product. The WWE Network has an enormous archive of original content available online for cheap, including every pay-per-view event ever, but check out other VOD sources and YouTube to find the classics of the territory days, and try to keep up with what's going on in the current indy promotions as well.Watch WCW's great cruiserweight matches with Sting and Vader, as well as classics by Dean Malenko, Eddy Guerrero, and Rey Mysterio Jr.
Watch Sandman, Raven, and Tommy Dreamer tear it up in the wild days of ECW.
Check out NWA classics from the 70s and 80s to see Harley Race, Tully Blanchard, Dusty Rhodes and Ric Flair in their prime.
Watch Verne Gagne, Mad Dog Vachon, Nick Bockwinkel, and Larry Zbyszko go head to head in AWA.
Lots of current and former wrestlers have podcasts, which include lots of wrestlers talking about the details of the wrestling business and telling stories. It's a great way to learn about what it takes. Check out podcasts by Colt Cabana, Jim Ross, and Steve Austin for a good perspective on the art of pro wrestling.

, Wrestlers who try out for WWE need at least 3-5 years of pro wrestling experience.The only wrestlers who go immediately into the WWE are recruited from amateur college wrestling programs or other athletics. Most other wrestlers get started wrestling for some kind of promotion other than the WWE and climb their way through the ranks. Here's a list of regional independent promotions, some of which have training schools as well:


Ring of Honor
Dragon Force
New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW)
Global Force Wrestling
AAA
Pro Wrestling Guerilla
Combat Zone Wrestling

, Smaller promotions will hire wrestlers who have received training. Many wrestlers start making a living by traveling between promotions in the region, doing a few shows at a time and gradually making connections in the business. Start getting yourself booked in as many territories as possible and working your way between them.


In the United States, the northeast is especially friendly to pro wrestling shows and indie wrestlers. Start working the circuit in your area.

, Go into business for yourself. Meet as many other wrestlers and promoters as you can and let them know that you're in the business of wrestling. Make yourself available to make appearance at shows of any kind, and try to get as many gigs as possible.


Print up and start selling your own merch at events. This is an excellent way to start coming up with some extra money, as well as to get to know other sides of the business. Think about what kind of a shirt people will be likely to buy. Then wrestle in it and sell it after the show.
Make up highlight packages of your matches. Start marketing your skills and your abilities in the squared circle by compiling highlight reels of your abilities. Load these up onto YouTube, or a personal website of your own.

, On the WWE website is a career page, which regularly posts job openings in a variety of different departments. Jobs include production, writing, and talent. Regional tryouts are held occasionally, where wrestlers may show off in an attempt to get the recruiters' attention. These tryouts will be posted on the WWE site and held at the NXT facility in Orlando, FL.According to some estimates, WWE gets as many as 2000 unsolicited wrestler applications every single week. You can send video and press to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Attention: Talent Relations, 1241 East Main Street, Stamford, CT 06902. It's very difficult to get a foot in the door this way.
Another way to try out for WWE is to tryout for their reality program, called Tough Enough. The show follows wrestlers who compete for a contract with WWE. The Miz, Ryback, and Big E were all contestants on Tough Enough.

, Almost all new recruits are sent to NXT, which is the training facility and wrestling promotion located in Orlando, FL, before joining the main WWE roster. There, you'll take promo classes, learn the details of TV production and working the camera, and hone your craft even more with some of the best wrestlers from around the world.


At any given time, there are roughly 70 trainees signed to NXT, 10-15 of whom are featured on the NXT programming on the WWE network. Of them, maybe 5 or so from any given group will come to the main roster. NXT has produced such wrestlers as Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, and Neville.

, The only sure way to make it to the main WWE roster? Shine. There's an ""it"" factor that every wrestler needs to have. It's something that can't be taught. You've got to have the charisma that will make people want to watch you, buy your merch, and follow your career. Find some way to distinguish yourself from the rest of the wrestlers on the card and take your spot.


There's no one way to be, because it's about being different. Daniel Bryan fits nobody's mold of what a WWE wrestler should look like or act like, but he is a huge superstar because of his ""every man"" style. Find yours.

Understand that wrestling is not entirely ""fake"".,
Learn to fight.,
Get in shape.,
Forget about gimmicks, characters, angles, and pushes.",How to Become a Pro Wrestler1,"


Professional wrestling is not fake; It's not scripted either; the correct term is choreographed. The whole match is not scripted; typically only the big exciting moments are. There is no way to fake a fall, or pretend to break objects over your head.
Many amateurs go into a wrestling school thinking that they won't get injured or that the ring will protect them from any harm. This is not true. .;
,


Knowing how to react in a real fight can make your future wrestling matches more realistic and entertaining.
Sometimes other wrestlers may get out of hand and your only option will be to fight back. Being able to remain calm in a high-stress situation will greatly improve the level respect you can command in the ring.

,


Wrestling is an extremely athletic activity. While you don't need the body of a world class athlete, you must have strong cardio to prevent ""blowing up"" early into your matches.

,


Once you learn the basics and mechanics of a wrestling match, you can begin to develop a character. Promoters may choose not to hire you for any reason, including your inability to portray a different character than the one you created for yourself.

Do this at a fast pace. Do push-ups and sit-ups, as well as stretch, at both the halfway point and end point. Increase distance every couple of days.;
,, You can always do more, but make sure you sprint all the time.

, Do the basics over and over until you can't get them wrong. Say what you're doing as you do the technique.

, Rotate opponents after each period, after each match rotate out. Always feel free to do more according to your motivation and physical condition. Also try doing sit ups to get those ""washboard abs"".

Train in the athletic stance.,
Incorporate chain wrestling.,
Add strength training.,
Enhance your agility.,
Include cardiovascular training.,
Consider attending a wrestling camp in the summer.",How to Become a Better High School Wrestler1," Using an athletic stance during training increases the benefits of your drills and conditioning exercises. There are three basic athletic stance positions to choose from. Select the one that feels the most natural to you and make sure that you always begin your training sessions in this stance.Universal. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees slightly and lean forward. Put your hands up in front of as if you are getting ready to grab your opponent.

Staggered. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, but place either your right or left leg a little ahead of the other leg, as if you have just taken a small step forward. Bend forward so that your back is almost parallel and put your hands out in front of you.

Parallel. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and bend at the waist until your back is parallel with the ground. Then, put your hands out in front of you.;
, Chain wrestling is a style where you plan out moves for specific situations, such as when you are in a hold. You can use chain wrestling to help you gain the advantage, rather than repeating the same moves over and over again. Chain wrestling is similar to making a sequence of moves in chess to beat your opponent.For example, you might develop a specific move to counter a hold and then have additional moves to follow that one, which will help you to achieve your goal of pinning your opponent.

, If you are not yet following a strength training routine, then now is a great time to start. Strength training can increase your power and this will give you an advantage during your matches. Make sure that you work with a trainer who is knowledgeable about strength training for wrestlers.Some good strength training exercises to add to your routine include:


pull-ups
push-ups
shoulder presses
wall sits
sit-ups

, Wrestlers need to be strong, but they also need to be agile, so agility training should be part of your program as well. You can improve your agility through training matches and actual wrestling matches, but you can also try other strategies, such as jumping rope or running obstacle courses.

, Wrestling is an intense cardiovascular workout, so it is also important to include some vigorous cardiovascular exercise in your training regimen, such as running or climbing stairs. You can use your cardio routine as a warmup to your workout, or incorporate the cardio into your wrestling training.


For example, you could run a couple of miles before you start your workout, or sprint across the gym a couple of times in between your strength training exercises.
Make sure that you take a few minutes to stretch before and after your workouts.

, Wrestling camps offer intensive training with talented coaches and other dedicated wrestlers like yourself. If you want to immerse yourself in wrestling and return to school in the fall with better wrestling skills, then a wrestling camp might be your best bet.


Ask your coaches if they know about any good wrestling camps in your area.

Invest in the appropriate gear.,
Work hard and follow the path to becoming a pro wrestler.,
Introduce strength training into your workout routine.,
Work on your grip strength.,
Work on your speed.,
Increase your protein levels.,
Eat foods that are high in carbs.,
Control your water intake.",How to Become a Pro Wrestler and Train at a Young Age," Two of the moves young wrestlers learn first are the single-leg takedown and the double-leg takedown.To do the single-leg takedown, grab one of your opponent’s legs and use your position to force them to the ground. In a double-leg takedown, grab both legs at the same time.


The most important thing is not how many moves you know, but that you’re comfortable in the basic positions and that you go into your matches with an idea of what positions you’re going to use.
Don’t focus on learning all the moves at once. Instead, focus on learning one or two and getting as good at them as you can be.;
, To do this, you will need a partner. Have your partner kneel on the floor with their palms facedown so their body looks like a tabletop. Hook one of your arms underneath your partner’s armpits. Rotate your body by leaning onto your partner's back and spinning your lower body like a top. When you reach your opponent's other side, hook your arms into their other armpit, then immediately turn around and come back the other way.After you’ve run this drill for a while, switch places so that you become the base and run the drill again.
Try to run this drill for 15 minutes every day.

, A popular option for children under the age of ten is to start in a freestyle/Greco-Roman wrestling club. This is a great option, because these clubs utilize folkstyle, which is the style of wrestling that is practiced in high schools and colleges in the United States.Training in folkstyle will give you a nice head start if you’re looking to compete later on in your academic career.


Select a team that focuses more on fitness and technicality, rather than competition. When training at a young age, fundamentals are more important than winning tournaments.

, In order to wrestle safely, you will need to secure the following equipment.All of the following equipment can be bought at a sporting goods store, or found in your own home.


Wrestling shoes
Headgear
Loose fitting clothing that doesn’t have any buttons, jewelry, zippers or metal.

, Becoming a pro-wrestler is a path that can take decades. Most pro-wrestlers spent years honing their skills on the mat. Once you join a team, compete in elementary school and go out for your middle school and high school teams. Look for a college with a strong wrestling program or skip college and get trained by a wrestling school in your area.Branch out into other sports to become the most well rounded athlete you can possibly be.
Try to work with people who have connections in the industry, so they can help you secure an agent. Getting signed is very important in order to be recruited as a professional. Be kind and work hard so people want to work with you.
Do not become discouraged by your setbacks. Losing matches is part of competing. The more matches you lose, the more you’ll appreciate the ones you win.

, Strength training is what most wrestlers use to improve their physical strength and power. There are differing opinions over when the appropriate age is to start strength training, but certain exercises can be done at any state of physical development.Some exercises that are appropriate for children as young as elementary school include:


Kettle bell swings –Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Squat down, and grip your kettle bell with palms facing you and thumbs wrapped around the handle. Stand up and swing the kettle bell to chest height. Bring the kettle bell back down between your knees and repeat.Swing from your hips and legs to avoid hurting your back. For more information, go here.
Battle ropes – to do these, you’ll need a set of battle ropes. Grip the rope handle in your hands and make waves with the rope, as fast as possible. Try to do two sets of one minute each.Pull ups
Push ups
Dips
Tumbling
Squats

, Grip strength is important because it allows you to maintain control over your opponents.Good exercises for grip strength include hanging onto the chin-up bar, rope climbing using only your arms and wrist rolls.To do wrist rolls, you will need a wrist roller. A wrist roller is a stick attached to a weight by a length of rope. To do a wrist roll, grip your wrist roller in both hands and lift your arms until they are fully extended in front of you. Rotate one wrist at a time towards your body, so that the stick rolls the weight up towards your face.Once the weight has reached the bar, rotate your wrists the other way to roll the weight back towards the floor.

, Speed is an incredibly important attribute in wrestling, so you’ll want to work on getting as fast as you can.

To improve your quickness, try incorporating the following exercises into your workout routine:

Jumping rope
Ladder drills – to do this, set up a ladder lying face-down in your back yard. Run through the ladder, making sure to step into the center of every rung. Focus on swinging your arms and lifting your knees high.Shadow wrestling – this is a great option if you don’t have a partner. Visualize that you’re in a fight and execute the moves that you would make. Try to make the movements as realistic as you would if you were in a real wrestling match.Line Hops – To do this, lay two jump ropes on the ground, side by side (they should be about two feet apart.) Push off one of your feet and hop to the outside of the other line. Hop back and forth between the two lines until you’ve reached the end. Try to do thirty line hops in a row. , Most children (especially child athletes) are only getting 25% of the protein their bodies actually need.

To increase your protein levels, try eating two eggs for breakfast, a peanut butter and jelly or turkey sandwich for lunch and chicken for dinner.

When you snack, snack on cheeses or yogurts as these are also high in protein.

, Carbs come in two forms: simple and complex. You’ll want to focus on eating complex carbs. To do this, add more breads, grains and cereals to your diet.Try to cut back on simple carbs. Some simple carbs, like fruit, are good, but soda and cookies are not. If you need some sugar, eat an apple or a banana.

, Most wrestlers have to gain and drop weight in a very short amount of time in order to make weight. Learning how to control your water is one easy way to lose or gain weight in a quick period of time.In order to control your water effectively, follow these steps:


Drink one gallon of water per day.
Two days before you’re scheduled to weigh in, drink 50% less water.
One day before you weigh in, drink 25% less water.
On your weigh in day, do not drink water until after you have weighed in."

You need help from others for training and guidance. So, place your ego aside and never be reluctant to ask others for help. You also need to make up your mind to follow this grueling path. Stay focused on what you want to achieve and toil away in groups to make a mark.;
, You don’t necessarily need to join a high profile gym or club at this early stage. Find any club that has all the basic equipment and qualified trainer who will help you with your basics. Even if you can’t afford to pay the gym fee, don’t worry; just remember that all the top champions started from zero.

, It is quite important what and how the trainer trains you so you must find yourself a good, expert trainer who has all the knowledge regarding MMA. He will get you trained in the best way possible in order to become a pro mixed martial artist quickly.


Coaching styles and tracking progress: Ask you coach what coaching style he follows, some coaches are very aggressive while others have a calmness about their methods of teaching. Now it’s up to you, if you can work with their coaching style, if you can’t then it’s better to find a coach who is able to help you. Remember the coach can only show you the right direction and it’s up to you to follow it. You must also tract your progress on daily basic, if you think there is no progress then start looking for a new trainer.
Fitness trends and injury preventive strategies: Fitness is the most important aspect of all combat sports. For this you need to research on latest trends in fitness and see if you can follow them, but before starting anything take advice from your trainer if you can follow them. Injuries are part and parcel of any MMA athlete, ask your trainer to help you with techniques that prevent injuries.

, Your health undoubtedly plays a vital role in your performance. You need a healthy and a fit body if you want to excel in mixed martial arts. You must eat sufficient amount of proper, nutritious food and drink plenty of water daily. Moreover, you should sleep well as it keeps both, your body and mind fresh. You should stay away from drugs and alcohol as they affect your body very badly.


Eat healthy food- Stuff yourself with carbohydrates as they give the much needed energy before the workout. Eat lots of protein as they will help you build muscle. Go easy on fat, good fats (saturated fats) are fine but stay away from bad fat (unsaturated fats), which are very bad for your health.
Take lot of fluids- Water is extremely important for you to remain hydrated, so drink lot of water throughout the day. Besides water, drink lots of fresh juices that will give you much needed energy.

, The gear which you use for fighting, training and practicing has a great impact on your performance and results so you need to buy the best MMA gear and equipment for yourself before starting your MMA journey. You can seek help from your trainer and search the internet to make sure that you get appropriate gear. Furthermore, you shouldn’t go for cheap equipment to save money.

, Even though defence is must, exceptional attacking skills are also mandatory if you want to reach the top. So you need to practice attack in several ways. There are many exercises and workouts which help you improve your attack efficiently. Consult your trainer and start improving your attack to get remarkable attacking skills.

, Defence is the best offence. You must develop outstanding defensive skillset if you want to stay undefeated throughout your professional MMA career. You must know how to block your opponent’s punches and when to throw the right punch. Start using intelligence along with strength and see how you achieve success in no time.

, Shadowboxing is a technique which is used to practice and analyse your skills. You can improve your footwork, attacking and defensive skills using this method. In this method, you fight in the ring without facing an opponent and practice all the moves which you are supposed to use inside the ring while facing an opponent.

, An individual develops a dominant hand right from the start, after birth. Dominant hand is the one that is used the most. Well, developing the stance also depends on your dominant hand. The majority of the population is right handed while only 7-10% of the population is left handed and they also tend to have a little ambidexterity in them. The fighting stance is the most vital factor that a fighter needs to learn in any type of Martial Art. Proper stance allows the fighter for strong and effortless movement and easy transference of force. The stances are of two types and one needs to choose one of them:


Southpaw – it is the stance in which fighter has his right hand and foot forward. He uses right jabs followed with let cross and right hook. This stance is common in left-handed boxers.
Orthodox – orthodox is simply the mirror image of southpaw stance and is common in right handed boxers. A traditional orthodox stance is the one in which fighter has his left foot in front of the right one.

, There are some fighting techniques that are necessary for an MMA fighter. Like bending you knees, never dropping your guard, and keeping a good defence. You will perfect these techniques with the help of you trainer over the period of time. You need to study the sport and learn from experience during an actual fight.


Bend your knees- By keeping your knees bent you can ease your movement in any direction. This give you freedom to defend, attack and counter attack.
Never drop your guard- When you are facing your opponent never drop your guard, this is very important whether you are a budding or expert MMA fighter. Keep your hands up to protect your face or elbows tucked in to protect your rib cage.
Fight from you head- MMA is not just about aggression alone; there are times when you need to defend and you can defend well if you have the ability to dodge your opponent. It is also far less damaging as compared to blocking. Blocking not only protects you but it also gives you a counter attacking option.

, Nowadays, social media is one of the best ways to get famous and popular. So you need to target all those who are connected through different social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, Tumblr, etc. To build your audience, you should upload the videos of your fights in which you performed amazingly.

, There’s no shortcut to success. You should not wait for a big fight (which is never gonna happen unless you show the world what you’re capable of) and start signing contracts with small fighters. You need to make sure that you don’t lose any fight (big or small) if you want to make history in MMA.

, Once you start winning small fights, you can contact sponsors and get yourself financed so that you can sign contracts with good fighters too. When you start winning big fights, you’ll definitely hit the eyes of many people and get famous pretty soon. You should keep this in mind that if you fail to win even a single fight in the beginning of your sponsorship, your sponsor will lose faith in you and stop financing you.

, When you defeat some good fighters, you’ll be able to challenge the top-class, renowned fighters. And if you win even a single fight against a well-known fighter, you’ll hit the highlights rapidly. Then your dream will start coming true. But you must know that winning against the big ones is not that easy so you have to get yourself trained in the best way.

, As soon as you start defeating expert mixed martial artists, you’ll be able to challenge the title holders in your weight class. And when you sign a contract with a champion, train hard for the fight against him and knock him down in the ring, you’ll reach your ultimate goal and become a world champion.

, Becoming a champion is a dream come true but that’s not all. When you wrap a belt around your waist, you need to make sure that no one steals it from you. You have to continue your legacy and keep fighting as hard as you can. That’s how you’ll become a legend in MMA.

, Building connections is very important nowadays. Visit as many fights and meet promoters. Another great way to build connections quickly is by visit people who are related to sport. You will find them on fight nights at the competitions. There you will also meet promoters, and introduce yourself to them. If they get impressed by you then they will help you arrange big fights for you, which will be very beneficial for your career.

Shop around.,
Be respectful


Your trainer and all other wrestlers have worked through everything you are struggling with today.",How to Become a Pro Wrestler2,"


Most independent promotions have several wrestlers that are willing to train new wrestlers, but this training will most likely not come for free. It is not uncommon for a wrestling gym to charge over $100 per session.
Travel your state and find a wrestler that fits the style you want to wrestle in. Try to talk to the promoter of the company and let him/her know that you are interested in becoming a wrestler. Some promoters are nicer than others. While pro-wrestling can seem to be just like any other community-theatre, many ""insiders"" are not fond of letting new people into the business.

If you are rejected, take it in stride. Continue coming to shows or perhaps ask to help with the technical aspects of running the show or working on the security team. As wrestlers and promoters get to know you, they will be more open to talking and allowing you to train.

What can you do to ensure that you can overcome this advantage in the future?

Remember that your coaches do not correct you or tell you how to wrestle to show off or make you feel bad, they do so to help you improve as a wrestler.If a coach gives you advice that you do not understand, ask for clarification.
If a coach gives you advice that you do not agree with, try the suggestion before you decide whether or not to include it in your practice.
Never talk back to your coaches or be disrespectful, even if you totally disagree with them.

, Before you go into a match, it is important to take about five minutes and visualize yourself winning the match. This practice has been shown to be effective for athletic success.To use visualization, close your eyes and picture yourself achieving your goal. Imagine how you will overcome certain obstacles and how you will feel after you have defeated your opponent. What will you look like? How will you feel?

, Persistence is one of the best ways to improve as a wrestler, so make sure that you are practicing every day. Maintaining a regular, consistent practice schedule will help you to build up your skills and keep you focused on wrestling.Avoid taking long breaks away from your training. For example, do not take the summer off even if you are not in school. Maintain a regular training schedule in the summer just as you would during the school year.

, Look confident out there! You've got your armor underneath anyway.

, It will be easier to get to the most accurate weight; it may be awkward but it tells all the other girls at the tournament that you are serious. Choose really good quality sports underwear so that it feels as if you're wearing a swimsuit.

, Everyone is doing the same thing. Even if it is tougher for you (because girls naturally have less muscle and more body fat), complaining is just annoying and it makes you look bad.

, You are all equal.

, Some guys will take advantage of any show of fear. Show only determination to succeed.


Don't let what other guys might say get to you. If they say something like, ""You're not tough enough"" just think: ""I'm tougher than all of them by being the only girl and doing this sport!"" Be yourself, and they will respect you and treat you like one of the team.

Many girls have better cardio than the guys they wrestle.Work hard to survive the first few minutes of your match and then concentrate on weakening your opponent. Time is on the side of the fittest wrestler.

, You want your team to be as good as possible, even if they are better than you.

, Don't talk to your competition too much, or to members of their team. By all means ask them questions such as ""what's your record?"", ""What's your weight?"", ""How have you been doing?"" and so forth, but do not make buddies with they will take advantage of that and you may well lose.

, Approach them and ask if you can speak in private. Explain your concerns with clear examples of why you think you are being treated unequally. Remember that coaches are there to support you!

Look and act angry or unfriendly.,
Insult and taunt your opponent, the crowd, everyone you have contact with.

,
Plant a fan.,
Cut a convincing promo.,
Perform classic ""heel"" moves:


The Low Blow: The most basic and evil move a heel can do, this will almost always get the great big ""boo"".",How to Be a Heel Wrestler," Your goal is to make everyone hate you.;
,, Sometimes, a seemingly regular member of the audience may actually be a member of the production itself. Have a cleverly placed ""fan"" in the audience whose sign you can steal rip up is a great way to get the rest of the crowd to hate you.

, Talk about your disdain for your opponent. Talk about how great you are, or how you are going to win the title. Talk down to the interviewer, as if he is less than you.

, There are a few different versions of this move: the kick version (kick your opponent from a standing position in the groin) and the uppercut version go down to your knees and then uppercut through their legs into the groin).
The Headbutt: While this move isn't really a heel move per se, it is perfect for a large heel wrestler because of it's sheer brute viciousness. Two human skulls cracking together with raw energy, and the heel brushes it off like it barely hurt.
The Illegal Pin: Hooking an opponents tights/pants or using the ropes for leverage are two great details to add to make a regular pin seem wrong and illegal.
Closed-Fist Punch: All punches in wrestling should be performed with an open-fist to avoid injury. It has also become customary that fans understand that open-fisted punches are used to make punches less fatal. However, this has also given heels a new move to use.
Eye Poke. Exactly what it sounds like.
Eye Rake. Slightly different from an eye poke, in this move you will pace your thumb over their forehead, then sweep it downward across their eye.
The Steel Corner. Removing the turnbuckle padding makes any move you do evil and more painful.
The Removal. For this move, you will want to remove an article of clothing (either your own or your opponent) to make the move seems worse than it is.
Foreign Object. The most classic of all moves, bringing in a weapon is the most evil of all things you can do. The two classic weapons are a chair, and a table, however any object can be used.
Poison Mist. Made famous by foreign Puroresu wrestlers, spitting a spray of mist into the opponents eyes to blind them will seems completely evil and dirty.
Interference. By interfering to help a fellow heel wrestler, or to beat down a face, either way it will look good.
Double Team: Isolate a member of the opponent's team and keep them in your corner. Attack them when the referee is not looking. The attack will end just in time for the referee to turn around.
Talk face wrestlers down in a promo, or make it seem as if they are the ones the fans should be boo-ing.
If you are a wrestler and are seen by fans in an area other than the ring, keep your character and don't break character, otherwise, you will mess up your heel gimmick.
The key to being a great heel, is to make your character convincing, that you don't care about the fans, you only care about being the butt-kicker in that industry.
If you have family in the crowd, treat them like you hate them. They will understand it's only an act.

Hunch over slightly and bend your knees to get into an athletic stance. Spread your arms out slightly out and forward from your body so you’re ready to grab them. Make sure they know that they are going to take a spear before you start the move. Spearing an unsuspecting opponent could seriously injure both you and your opponent. Besides knowing that you’re about to spear them, your adversary also needs to know what side you will hit them on. If you aren’t sure, don’t attempt one. It’s not worth the risk. ;
, Run at a medium pace so the move looks authentic but you still have time to react. Try to pace your steps out so one lands about a foot in front of your opponent. Landing too far forward or too far back will make it difficult to connect at the right moment. Don’t run straight at your opponent. Aim slightly either to the left or right of them so you’re in the proper position when the two of you meet. , The perfect place to hit your opponent with a spear is around the bottom of their rib cage. Lower your head so your shoulder is about in line with the middle of your opponent’s torso when you are two or three steps away. Be absolutely certain that your shoulder is in line with the near side of your opponent’s torso so you don’t make contact with your head. , You need to be ready to hit your opponent one step before you actually make contact. Extend the arm closest to your opponent so your bicep is perpendicular with your neck. Bend your elbow slightly forward to get your arm ready to wrap up your opponent. The inside of your palm and elbow should be facing the defending wrestler. , Hit your opponent in the middle of their torso with your shoulder and bicep. You should connect with the bottom portion of their ribcage with your neck and head underneath your opponent’s arm. Try to hit your opponent across their entire body to spread out the impact and minimize how much it actually hurts. Make sure your head and neck do not make contact with your opponent. You can suffer serious and permanent injury if you fail to do this. No matter how many times you successfully execute a spear, this is something you need to think about every time. Pros have had their careers ended by failing to do this. Don’t hit them in the stomach. This will hurt the defender a lot and cause them to flip over forwards. If you think you’re going in too low, bail out by stopping or rolling your body away from your opponent. , You have to grasp your opponent’s torso with your arm in order to properly perform a spear. You won’t maintain contact if you don’t and it will look more look a shoulder tackle than a spear.You’ll probably be able to reach your arm around just enough to hold onto a little bit of their back. Don’t try to grab as much of them as possible though, or you might trap your arm underneath your opponent when they land. , They’ll begin to fall backwards as soon as you make contact. Keep holding onto them and follow them down to the mat throughout the entirety of their fall. This will make it look like you are driving them down into the mat, even if you’re really just following them as they fall down. , You don’t want to land on top of your opponent or hit the ground next to them at full force. About halfway through the fall, extend one of your knees and your outside arm to catch your weight. You may find you prefer to land on one knee, but it will probably be easiest to land on the leg opposite of the one you last took a step with. It might look kind of awkward at first, but many pros still land on one hand and knee when they hit their opponent with a spear. They just know how to get out of quickly so it looks like they plowed straight through them. Pay attention to your favorite wrestler’s spears and you’ll probably begin to notice it yourself. , You’re going to have keep moving if you want to sell the hit. Scramble forward after you land, leading with the shoulder that you hit your opponent with. Doing so will make it look like you put all your weight into the move and really demolished them.

, Lift up the arm on the side you will be hit on so it is about parallel with your shoulder just before your opponent makes contact. Don’t do it too early or it will look scripted, a step before they reach you is appropriate. You won’t be able to properly do a back bump if your arm is pinned by your opponent, and you may injure your shoulder if you land awkwardly. , A back bump is how wrestlers safely land on their backs during a match. Mastering the back bump is vital for anyone who wants to learn wrestling moves. If you aren’t sure how to do this, don’t attempt the spear. Practice by yourself for a little bit until you are comfortable doing a back bump. Lean backwards just before your opponent makes contact. You should pivot at your hips so both the bottom and top of your back are tilted towards the mat. Don’t lean too far back. You should still be able to spread your weight throughout the entirety of both your feet. If all your weight is on your heels after you lean back, it will be difficult to kick your feet out. Kick your feet out in front of you at the moment of contact. The second your opponent hits you, kick both your feet out in front of you. You will probably find it easier to kick them up one at a time, but don’t wait too long between kicks. You want to give the impression that you were knocked clean off your feet, not pushed over.

, Feel your back with your hands. You’ll find that the middle of your back is has the most muscle and fat protecting it. Have this part of your back make contact with the ground first. Don’t lean to one side so the impact is spread out as much as possible. Don’t bend so your spine is the first thing to hit the ground. Make sure your head doesn’t hit the mat. You shouldn’t hit the ground so hard that you can’t control where your head goes. It’s still possible to injure your head if you hit it against a wrestling mat.

, Your arms should hit the ground perpendicular to your neck and spine. Slam the backs of them down into the ground as you make contact. This will help spread out the impact of the fall while also making a loud smack on the mat, really selling the force of the hit. It’s up to you whether you want to slam your legs into the ground or leave them sticking up in the air. Hits can look a little more savage if you leave your legs in the air, but you can make a louder slam if you bring them down into the mat with your arms. Try both and see what feels right to you. It’s worth mastering both so you can mix it up and have the moves look less scripted.

, No one is strong enough to pop right back up after being on the receiving end of a brutal spear. Roll around on your back a little bit. Gasp for air and reach towards the sky. Stumble a little bit getting up while you rub your back. Grimace in pain -- whatever you can think of to increase the drama. "

Pay closer attention to how the moves are performed. Watch (rewatch) body and hand positioning, takeoff and landing methods, and how wrestlers “sell” the move. Keep an eye out for the safety measures hidden within the moves.
Watch videos of older wrestling shows as well. Watch for similarities and differences in technique and style.Go to live wrestling shows. Even if it is a local or regional circuit with a lower caliber of performance, watching wrestlers perform in person gives you a truer sense of the complexity and power of pro wrestling maneuvers. Watch for how these ostensible opponents work in concert to complete the moves successfully and safely. Talk to some of the wrestlers if you get the chance, and let them know about your interest in learning. They may have valuable advice.;
, Strength training is obviously important, but so too is endurance and flexibility training. Good pro wrestlers don’t just pump iron, they do intensive cardio workouts and do plenty of stretching -- even yoga!Improving your physical conditioning will give you some added protection against injury.
If you’re in high school, joining the wrestling team might make sense, but playing sports in general will help with conditioning and body control.
Some strength training exercises to consider include: bench presses; chin-ups; dips; biceps curls; hand grips; wrist rolls; leg curls; leg extensions; squats; leg presses; shoulder shrugs; and 4-way neck presses.Some cardio workouts to consider include: 3-mile timed runs; 10 x 400 meter interval runs; 30 minute recovery jogs;and other cardio activities such as swimming and biking.
Train hard, but allow time for recovery. This is when your muscles (including your cardiovascular system) heal and in the process become stronger.

, Watching pro wrestlers closely should give you a better idea of the intricate detail and precise timing needed to successfully complete even seemingly simple wrestling maneuvers. You’ll want to start trying out the moves you’ve been watching the pros do, maybe on your buddy in the backyard, but do not attempt them until you have been properly trained.


Training, preparation, and practice will make doing wrestling moves safer, but even seasoned professionals can meet a tragic end when attempting them., If you don’t know of any in your area, contact your state athletic commission for help in finding one.Seek out a school with a track record of effective, safe training. Here’s an instance where striking up that conversation with wrestlers at a local show might pay off.
Be realistic with your goals. If you’re dreaming of becoming a WWE superstar, your local wrestling school almost certainly won’t cut it. Most pros train at large schools in Florida, run by former pros with a long track record. But that doesn’t mean a local wrestling school can’t provide an instructive and fun experience that could turn into something bigger if you prove you have the right stuff.

, Each wrestling school will be different, but expect regular instruction sessions with other aspiring wrestlers. You will work together on building your skills inside the ring, of course, but also outside it as well -- things like character creation and interviewing.Expect, and in fact demand, honest opinions on your skills.Wrestling instructors are unlikely to be shy about giving their opinion, so you’ll need a thick skin. Think of it as tough love -- doing these moves safely and effectively requires precision every time.

, If you find that safety is not the first priority at your wrestling school, strongly consider finding a new one. Don’t risk your health or that of your classmates unnecessarily.

, When you do begin to practice moves, remember that successful pro wrestling moves always require successful execution by both parties. Start slow and build up a familiarity and trust factor with your practice ring foes.


Pro wrestlers tend to think of their ring mates more as teammates than opponents.They need to practice and execute together in order to succeed, just like a basketball team.

, Use the descriptions and steps below as a reference to familiarize yourself with the intricacies of ten classic pro wrestling maneuvers that would be taught in wrestling school.

Or if they have their head slightly bent toward you, reach out and pull their head down by clasping your hands behind their neck and pulling down. Get their head at the level of your chest, with their face toward the ground.Wait for any time your opponent comes toward you with their head toward the outside of your body. This is an ideal position for you to perform this choke.;
, With their head still facing down, wrap one of your arms around the back of your opponent’s head. Wrap it all the way around so that your forearm is against their neck.Face the palm of your hand toward your own chest to keep the pressure tight.

, Grasp the wrist of the arm you have wrapped around your opponent with your other hand. Hold this grip tightly so that your opponent can’t remove his head from the bind created by your arms.


You can also try a cup-and-saucer grip by making the hand of your choking arm into a fist and grasping that fist with the open palm of your other hand.
Another variation is to use a chainlink grip, in which the fingers of each hand are cupped to grasp the other.
You can also hold your opponent’s back by hooking your arm under theirs to reach the back and grasping your bicep with your choking arm. Or, hold their tricep or trapezius (top of the shoulder) and grasp your own bicep or wrist with your choking arm., Maintain your hold around your opponent’s neck and pull up with both hands. Imagine you are trying to stretch your opponent out.

Employ the guillotine choke to force submission.,
Make this move a blood or air choke.,
Try a reverse variation.",How to Perform the Guillotine Choke3," Use the guillotine in wrestling or martial arts when you want to force your opponent into submission. The tight choke forces your opponent to tap out (end the round) or else suffer extreme discomfort or injury.


Ideal situations for using this choke are when an opponent lunges toward your legs, when they move to escape from your guard position on the ground, or any other time that their head is low and close enough to your body to position your choking arm behind the neck.

, Decide whether you want this choke to constrict your opponent’s blood flow, or if you want it to constrict air flow. This change is dependent on the placement of your arm around their neck.


For a “blood choke,” make sure to place the radial bone on your inner wrist against your opponent’s carotid artery, located at either side of the neck.
For an “air choke,” place the full pressure of your forearm against your opponent’s windpipe, located at the front of the neck.Both methods will force an opponent into submission, as they will lose consciousness quickly from either suffocation or lack of blood flow.

, Attempt a variation on the guillotine choke by cupping the back of your opponent’s head with one hand. Then place your choking arm underneath their neck. Place the hand of your choking arm on your other bicep, then reach with your non-choking arm toward the opposite shoulder.This method differs from the standard guillotine choke in that your choking arm doesn’t wrap from the back around to the front of your opponent’s neck, but rather reaches under for the front of the neck directly. Your non-choking arm reaches for the opposite shoulder to create a tight hold.
Use this variation any time that you would perform a regular guillotine choke. You may prefer this version if your opponent’s head is not close enough or down far enough for you to easily wrap your arm over the neck as in a regular guillotine.

Lock and squeeze with your upper arm. This keeps them from posting on your knee. Don't let go of their far wrist. If you're arms aren't very flexible, this pinning combination may feel a little uncomfortable for your shoulders, but you can bet your opponent feels much less comfortable. They should wind up stacked on their shoulders with their legs in the air and you holding their right wrist and chicken winging their left arm.

, To do this, simply bring your legs in front of your hips and sag towards the ground. This redistributes your weight onto the shoulders of your opponent, forcing his/her shoulders down into the mat.

Place your opponent on their back in the center of the ring.,

Step through with your dominant leg.,
Cross your opponent's legs around your leg, starting with the near the leg.,
Pivot and roll your opponent over by stepping across.,
Squat and support your own weight.",How to Do the Sharpshooter1," To do the move correctly, you have to start by positioning your opponent so that they'll be far from the ropes to make the submission hold more believable. In general, the move is applied in the center of the ring so the opponent may not grab the ropes to break the hold. It's common to drag or otherwise place your opponent in the center for this reason.


Pro wrestling moves are intricately choreographed maneuvers that need to be performed in a wrestling ring by two wrestlers who are communicating and working together. The sharpshooter is a move that looks devastating when performed correctly, but should cause absolutely no discomfort. Done incorrectly, you risk causing serious back injury.;
, Take each foot in your hand and hold them about waist-level, forming a ""V"" with your opponent's legs.

, If you're right-legged, step through the V of your opponent's legs and put your right foot on the mat next to his abdomen. Continue holding on to his feet.


You can do the move to either side by stepping through with either leg. Bret Hart always stepped through with his left leg, so technically, doing the sharpshooter means you should go to your left. However, the move is the same no matter which side you roll toward; the only difference involves the order in which you cross the opponent's legs, discussed in the next step.

, If you stepped to the right, cross the opponent's leg to your right (his left leg) over your thigh, then cross the other leg (his right leg) over it. Tuck the right ankle in your armpit, as you could for a front face lock, gripping it firmly.


Always start with the leg on the side toward which you stepped. If you step through with your left leg, cross your opponent's right leg first.

, If you started the move with your right leg, turn and step over your opponent's body, rolling them over in the process.


This should be a cooperative move: as you support your opponent's legs, he should flail his arms as if trying to resist, but should be shifting weight to roll over comfortably. This would be very difficult to do if your opponent dead-weighted, or resisted.

, Lean back into a squatting position while still holding onto both of their legs. Support your opponent's knee with your hand. You should squat just above your opponent's buttocks. Wrestlers will often rehearse such submission holds in the mirror while at the gym, to get a sense of how it should look.


Don't pull back on your opponent's legs, but do pretend to pull back by straining your face and throwing your head back. The believability of the move depends on your making it look like you're pulling hard, but not.
Under no circumstances should you sit with all your weight on your opponent's buttocks or back. This is an absolutely essential aspect of the move. While it looks like Bret Hart is sitting and cinching the move in, he's really doing a deep squat, supporting his own weight. It takes a lot of core and lower-body strength to support the weight of your opponent's legs and your own weight while squatting.

Work on the common reverses and escapes.",How to Do the Sharpshooter2," Don't just lay there like a sandbag. As the receiver of the sharpshooter, help to hold your legs up as much as possible and make it easier by shifting your weight up on your elbow and shoulder as you're being rolled.


Depending on the story being told, it might be important to also give the appearance of struggling. Wave your free arm around and put a pained look of fear on your face. It'll look much better.

, Once you've been rolled over, you've got to start acting. Scream and holler like it's painful, like you're having your legs pulled out of their sockets. Lots of wrestlers will grab their heads, bang on the mat, and start crawling for the ropes. If you just lay there, the move doesn't look good. In a certain way, it's mostly on you to make or break the move.


If the match calls for you to tap out–to give up–don't do it right away. Give off the impression like you're trying to hold out, you're trying to get out of it, and you don't want to give the match up. Then tap on your opponent's leg three times, reluctantly, signaling your withdrawal.
Check out ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin's sell of the sharpshooter at Wrestlemania 13 for inspiration. It's one of the iconic images of wrestling.

, Just because you're wrapped up in a submission hold doesn't mean the only option is for you to tap out. There are less clear-cut reversals than in some other submission holds, but there are a few you can work out with your opponent, depending on whether or not the story calls for it.



Head for the ropes. The best way to break the sharpshooter is to grab hold of one of the ring ropes, which will give your opponent until the count of five to break the hold, or he will be disqualified. If you're in the center of the ring, get up on your elbows and start crawling, dragging your opponent with you. Intestinal fortitude to the max.

Straighten your legs. Work with your opponent to power out of the sharpshooter by straightening your legs and pushing his torso toward the ground. If you work together, you could even shift into a roll-over pinning combination.

Grab his ankle and flip into your own sharpshooter. If you can reach back and get your opponent off his feet, you'll release the weight and be able to stand up. Now, he'll be in position for the sharpshooter, or another Boston-Crab-type submission hold.

Try the Scorpion Death Lock.,
Try the inverted sharpshooter or ""Edgecator."",
Try the double-cross sharpshooter.",How to Do the Sharpshooter3," Wrestler Sting used the same basic hold as a finishing maneuver, with subtle differences. The Scorpion Death Lock always rolls to the right, for example, and typically Sting will make a big deal out of rolling over the opponent slowly, whereas Bret Hart cinches it in quickly. While Sting rolls it over, he points with his other hand straight up at the sky and yells out to the crowd, cheering wildly, before squatting.


According to wrestling lore, Bret Hart actually learned the move when a backstage employee suggested that he try out the wrestler Sting's finishing move as a submission hold, making the Scorpion Death Lock the original iteration of the hold., One of the patented moves of the ""Rated R Superstar"" Edge, the Educator was basically a half-completed sharpshooter. To do the move, wrap up your opponent's legs as normal, and start turning over, but stop halfway. Instead of throwing your leg over, drop down on one knee, so your opponent is on his shoulder, giving the appearance of being bent sideways.


Have your opponent support his weight on his shoulder, essentially doing a side-bridge. It takes abdominal muscles of steel but looks great.

, In pro wrestling, the sharpshooter has become synonymous with controversy surrounding the 1997 Survivor Series match commonly known as the ""Montreal Screwjob,"" in which Bret Hart–unbeknownst to him–lost after being put in his own finishing move. Because of this, the sharpshooter is the go-to move if something shady is going on in the match. Using the sharpshooter can be a tip of the hat to that still-controversial finish.

Perform basic kicks.",How to Understand Basic Karate," This martial art has its roots in China, but was largely developed in Okinawa, Japan in the 1600’s as a method for self-defence due to weapons being outlawed. Karate can be translated to “empty hand.”There are many styles of Karate from traditional, to modern, western styles known usually as American Freestyle Karate, and Full-Contact Karate (Sport Karate), but many of the basic techniques are the same. Some of the more popular styles are:


”Shotokan” is considered the first style of modern Karate (created by Gichin Funakoshi. Practitioners use steady, powerful movements and center themselves in all stances.;
, Movements are generally slower with a focus on breath.

, Training in Karate generally involves four aspects, or fundamentals. These fundamentals are the different forms of movements that make up combinations and techniques practiced in Karate.Kihon (Basic techniques)

Kata (Form or pattern)

Bunkai (Study of techniques encoded in kata or ""kata application"")

Kumite (Free Sparring).

, People often confuse different styles of martial arts, and interchange the names of these martial arts. It can be easy to confuse Karate with other martial arts, especially because so many arts employ similar techniques.Karate focuses on striking moves with and on open-handed techniques. Karate combinations involve the use of punches, kicking, knee, and elbow strikes.
Other martial arts involve different fighting techniques and the use of weapons. Aikido focuses on evasion, joint locks, joint breaks, throws and controls. Judo focuses  on throws and some grappling while taking your opponent to the ground. Kung Fu is a Chinese martial art which has various styles that are inspired by animal movements, or by Chinese philosophies, and work to improve muscle and cardiovascular fitness.
While several martial arts use a ranking system depicted by a belt or sash, Karate has a specific system of colored belts. White represents the beginner with black representing an advanced level., Kihon translates to “basic techniques”, and is the foundation on which Karate is built. In kihon, you learn the Karate way of punching, blocking, kicking and movement.Often you will do drills for your Sensei that may seem dull and boring, however, these blocks, punches, and kicks are vital to being able to perform Karate proficiently.
The basics include blocks, strikes, kicks, and different stances. Students will practice these basic techniques repeatedly so they become ingrained in the body and mind.

, Kata translates to “forms” and builds upon the basic techniques you have learned. With kata, you learn to combine the basic techniques in a flowing movement.








Each kata is built around a specific fighting strategy for you to understand and practice against imaginary opponents.
Kata is a way for teachers to pass along knowledge of techniques used in Karate. As a student, you will learn to perform a series of blocks, strikes, throws, movements, and kicks together with kata.

, Bunkai translates to “analysis” or “disassembly”, and involves working with others to understand the real world application of a kata.








In bunkai, you analyze every movement in a given kata and develop possible applications in real combat situations. Bunkai is a transition step to kumite.
The concept of bunkai can be a little hard to understand because it involves you using kata to “fight” and “defend” yourself against an opponent that isn’t there. Think of it like using ballet steps being combined into a single choreographed dance which tells a story.

, Kumite means sparring, and allows students to practice the techniques learned in Karate against one another, and oftentimes in tournaments.








In kumite, you learn to apply kihon and bunkai in a controlled environment. Kumite is one step closer to real combat, in that two practitioners will attempt to perform moves on each other.
Kumite is sometimes performed in turns, or in Du Kumite which is another step towards free fighting with a points system sometimes applied to certain attacks.

, Karate punches use a straight punch technique with a twist of the wrist near the point of impact.


Always hit with your first two knuckles, and make sure that your elbow is not locked, because you may overextend it and get hurt.
Pull the fist that isn't punching back to your waist as you punch. This is called Hikite and if timed correctly, your punch will be stronger and sharper (push, pull effect).
Incorporate kiai. Kiai is broken down into Ki, meaning energy, and Ai, meaning join. It is the sound you often hear when someone makes an attacking movement such as a punch. The purpose of kiai to release your stored energy, creating a greater impact on you attack., Because Karate is used primarily as self-defence and not offence, there are a number of basic blocking techniques that you will learn in order to defend yourself in any situation.









Upper rising block (Jodan Age Uke)
Middle block (""Chudan Age Uke)
Downward block (Gedan Age Uke)

, Though Karate means “open hand” and is primarily used as self-defense, kicks are used to for a number of reasons like keeping distance between you and your attacker, or as alternative option when your upper body may be unable to perform a move due to having to block or deflect an attack.

More popular styles benefit from more people to learn from, more funding and the occasional visit from a master from Japan. Here are the most popular styles:


Goju Kai. Its founder, Gogen Yamaguchi, was famously taken prisoner by the Russians in World War 2. The Russians attempted to feed him to a hungry tiger, but he killed the tiger with his bare hands. Goju has many more circular and close in/grappling techniques.
Shotokan. Shotokan is the most traditional Japanese style. It takes its name from a pen name that Master Funakoshi used in his poetry.The name means the ""house where you hear the wind blowing through the pine trees. It is very direct, with strong movements in a linear fashion towards the target.
Shito ryu. Shito is an attempt to unify the linear Shotokan and the circular Goju into one combined discipline.
Wado ryu. Wado contains various Judo like throws.
Kyokushin Kai. Kyokushin has a reputation for being very intense and is good if you aspire to full contact fighting. It's founder, Mas Oyama, was known for fighting bulls in demonstrations, and repeatedly cut off bull's horns with an open hand (knife) strike.;
, As in anything, the actual teacher may be more important that the school.


Make sure the School follows your philosophy. Some schools are full of 18 year olds with lots of contact, excitement, and broken bones. Some are spiritual and have no contact. This is probably the most important thing to consider in choosing.
Ensure lessons are are at a convenient time and place for you.
Watch a lesson before you actually join, to see if you like the style.
Decide if you want to practice with children or not. It is very hard to make a living teaching karate, and many schools make their cash by teaching a lot of children. That may be fine with you, or may not be.
Don't worry about toning, strengthening and weight loss. All forms of karate are great exercise. Karate is a full body exercise, and is great for aerobic /heart rate training and endurance. Any school will help in this area, all you have to do is go to one.
Most karate instructors are very honest. However, be careful not to join a school with some kind of restrictive contract.

, Improvement in karate comes from repetition, honing and muscle memory. You can go, once, twice, 3 times a week, it doesn't matter that much. More is better, but most important is the regular schedule.

, Do the warming up exercises/stretches and cooling down exercises at the beginning and end of each practice. Not only are they good for you, but all the stretches allow you to become flexible enough to learn more advanced techniques.

, There is a lot to learn, but just take it one at a time.



Kihon means basic training. Most classes will start with some Kihon to get into the swing of things. Since karate is learned by muscle memory, repeating basics is helpful (and fun.) It includes basic punches, kicks, blocks, and stances.
""Kumite"" means, ""sparring."" In almost all schools, beginning sparring is structured, with no contact allowed. As you progress, you get to more and more free forms until you are doing free sparring.
""Kata"" means ""prearranged exercises."" Kata's consist of between 20 and 60 choreographed moves, where you can show your skill in front of others. Katas will be different in the different styles of karate.

, Mostly, they consist of kata and kumite contests. By seeing other schools compete, you will learn a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of your school.

, There are tests occasionally, where you can show your stuff and get a great new colored belt. Normally, the instructors only let you take the test if you can pass it.

, Etiquette is how Karate-ka balance the power of karate and stay humble. Enjoy your growing strength and power, but do it humbly.Always bow entering and leaving the dojo. Bow to teachers. Say thank you.
Say osu to your teachers and seniors. Also do the same if anyone says that to you.

, The ""Do"" in Karate-Do refers to the journey one takes in learning. You can learn a lot by reading or watching about the great masters.""The Karate Kid"" is not that deep. After practicing karate for just a few months, you will be able to how bad the kicks are in that movie. Still, it does have a few lessons for us.

, Some comments from Master Kanazawa, the founder of SKIFinclude:


""By better breathing, your techniques get more fluid.""
""The most dangerous person in the Dojo is the brown belt who does not know control. They should be strong and aggressive, but need to understand grace and humility to move to black belt.""
""You start training at first degree black belt.""
""After breaking my elbow on the block of ice, I understood Ki much more than before.""
""I no longer fear death.""

, Stances are one of the most important factors of karate when doing the movements. No movement will ever work effectively without a good stance.


Wiggle your toes. Now grip the floor with your feet as much as you can. Feel a ""readiness"" rise in your mind and body. Are your feet firm in the ground? Feel the roots growing from them into the ground. Can somebody push you over easily?
Breathe in deeply, then breath out through your belly button. Don't actually, but as you breath out crunch your core (torso/lower stomach). Feel it harden as the muscles come together to protect you. This may take some practise.
Do not hunch over your back. Have a slightly rounded back, not a circle.
Hit your stomach. Does it feel in the slightest bit harder than before? If so, you are doing it right.

, Place it in front of you, elbow bent so that it stands up relatively straight from the elbow down in front of the middle of your torso.
Press all your fingers together. Separated fingers show weakness (most of the time) and can cause injury.
Aim your fingertips toward the sky, so your arm is going down (slanted)-up (slanted)- fingertips to sky, hand straight.
The arm you are using hand should curl into a fist. Always put your thumb on the outside, not the inside. Many people get this wrong. If your thumb is on the inside your fist, it could seriously hurt when you perform any strike. Put your thumb across that in-between section of the two finger joints of your other fingers- not on top or in the front. It should be at the bottom of your fist.
Place your striking fist on the front of your body, so the the arm sticks out to the side and back. Your hand should be on the side of your body where your striking hands arm is, on that side, and roughly where a woman's one breast would be- just about 10 cm below your collarbone.
Hold your hand there- don't let it flop.

,


Turn your hips slightly in the same direction as your shoulders.

,


Quickly rotate your hips facing forward, using this slight momentum to swing your striking shoulder forward.
As your shoulders align with your hips (facing forward), lift the elbow so it is the same height as your shoulder.
Now hit whatever you are hitting with the side of your arm and fist where the pinky and elbow tip are.
Use your shoulder rotation.
All of the steps from twisting your hips should be done in a few seconds.

Teach them the four basic options we all have whenever we don't like a situation we're in


Dr. Paul Hauck says we always have four basic options






Problem solve and assert yourself
Tolerate with disturbance
Tolerate without disturbance
Leave


It's important to point out that we get what we tolerate






If we tolerate others bad behavior, what reason do they have to change?",How to Teach Kids Mental and Emotional Karate for Bullying,"


Most people have an external locus of control. They wrongly believe that what others say and do, and what happens makes them feel the way they do. That's not true. It needlessly puts them at the mercy of others and causes them to often feel worse than they need to. More importantly, it causes them to miss opportunities to feel better.






The real formula for feelings is: event + thoughts = feelings. What others say and do is just an event in the formula. It's what we choose to think about the events of our lives that really determines how we feel. Thoughts cause feelings, not events.






We all have a host of cognitive choices that we make all the time that determine how we feel. For example, how we choose to look at what happens, what meaning we attach to it, what we focus on, what we compare things to, what we imagine will happen next, and how much importance we attach to what does. No one can make these choices for us, unless we let them. People of all ages do that all the time, but with practice and rehearsal, we can take that power and control away from others.






Ultimately, we want to get kids to this place: ""You can think or say whatever you want about me, but it's my choice how I look at myself, and how I feel about myself. And you don't get to make those choices for me, unless I let you. And I choose not to"".






As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ""No one can make you feel bad about yourself without your permission"".
Dr. Victor Frankl, a holocaust survivor, taught us that no one can get inside our head unless we let them. He summed up why by saying, ""Everything can be taken from us but the last of human freedoms - to choose one's own attitude in any given set of circumstances. To choose one's own way"". It takes practice, but it's doable.


Of course, one of the best ways to teach kids to have an internal locus of control is to teach yourself to have one and model having one for them.





;
,


Luckily, Dr. Albert Ellis developed a simple model for irrational thinking that is easy to teach to kids. He said that when we disturb ourselves needlessly, it's because we make demands of ourselves, others, and life. We awfulize about what is happening to us. We might tell ourselves we can't stand things we simply don't like; and label and condemn ourselves or others.






Demandiness - Everyone has the right to want whatever they want. However, when people start to demand things of themselves or others, it creates a needless bigger gap between their expectations and reality. This generates more emotion than is necessary or helpful.






A kid has a right to want other kids to leave him/her alone, but when that want becomes a demand, such as ""They CAN'T keep doing this to me!"" or ""They HAVE TO leave me alone!"", he/she is more likely to generate anger than frustration or irritation, which will either do no good to get others to stop, or cause him/her to do something stupid (i.e. bring a gun to school).
If a kid doesn't want to have to deal with such torment, that's understandable. If he/she does, he/she will be sad. However, if they demand that they not have to deal with such things (i.e. ""I SHOULDN'T have to deal with this"" or ""This SHOULDN'T be happening to me"") and he/she does have to deal with it, he/she will get depressed.
Demands often come in the form of a question, like ""How dare they say that about me?"" or ""How could they treat others like that?""


Awfulizing - There are a lot of things that are unpleasant, inconvenient and uncomfortable in life. What people do is start to tell themselves it's awful, as in the worse possible thing that could happen to them. Being bullied is certainly not pleasant, comfortable or convenient, but we all know there are a lot worse things that can happen to kids.






Can't Stand It-itis - We all have a right to not like what happens, but people start to tell themselves they can't stand what is happening. If we truly couldn't stand something, we'd die or go crazy. Obviously, people say they can't stand a lot of things and don't. However, by telling themselves they can't stand things they simply don't like, they needlessly inflame themselves. That's why Dr. Ellis put the -itis suffix at the end of ""can't stand it"".






Label and Damning - Finally, we have a right to not like what we or others say and do. People start to label and damn themselves or others - to condemn the doer instead of the deed. It's called blatant over generalization because it's like calling an apple ""bad"" simply because it has a bruise, even though 90% of the apple is still just fine.






All these four types of irrational thinking play a role in bullying, both in the minds of those doing it, and those on the receiving end.







,


One simple way is to ask ""Is that a fact or just an opinion?"" This is a simple way to teach kids to respond to the comments of others. The point being that what others say is just their opinion, and they are entitled to it, but we don't have to have the same opinion as theirs. We're entitled to our own. As noted above, it's our choice how we want to look at ourselves, or anything else. This simple notion when stated out loud can be very liberating.






There are a host of simple questions we can ask kids, and teach them to ask themselves.






For example, if their demand was ""They can't do that to me"", you'd ask ""They can't, or you just don't like when they do?""
If their belief was ""They have to leave me alone"", you'd ask ""They have to, or you just want them to?""
If they were awfulizing, you'd ask ""Is it awful, or just unpleasant?"".
If they were telling themselves ""I can't stand when they do that to me"", you'd ask ""You can't stand it, or just don't like it?""
If they were label and damning themselves, i.e. ""I'm stupid for letting them do that to me"", you ask, ""You're stupid, or just don't like not being able to get them to stop?"" or ""You're stupid, or just a fallible human being who struggles with others doing things like that to him/her like so many others do?""
One simple question a friend has started asking his 3 year old when she awfulizes is, ""Sarah, big deal or little deal?"" She's learning to respond ""Little deal Daddy"", and then gets on with her day.


When posing such questions, it helps to affirm their preference first, which means that you let them know that they have a right to want whatever they want, but just went too far by demanding it. Or, that they have a right to dislike whatever they want, but went too far when they started telling themselves it's awful, and they can't stand it, or labeled and damned either themselves or others.






For example, ""I can understand why you don't like them doing that to you. I wouldn't like it either. I doubt anyone would. But why can't they do that to you?""
Or, ""I agree that it's really unpleasant when people do what they did, but why is it awful? Is it awful or just unpleasant?""


We want asking these questions to be rehearsed and practiced so much that they become like spell check or grammar check on a computer.






When asked such questions, kids will typically start their answers with ""Because...."" Anything they say after that will be the wrong answer.






The only correct answers to a question like ""Why can't they do that to you?"" are unfortunately ""They can, I just don't want them to"" and/or ""They can, I just don't like when they do""


When demands come in a form of a question, like ""How dare they say that about me?"", the answer unfortunately is ""Easily!"" It doesn't take a lot of effort or energy, or even creativity, to rip on someone else. It's easy. Teaching kids that the answer to such questions is always ""Easily!"" is another way to temper their demands, and get them to turn their cognitive and emotional thermostats down.






The Scientific Method is another approach to irrational thinking. We teach it in classes all over the world. So it's easy to tap into kids' prior knowledge of the process. Every thought we have or comment we make (or others have or make) is basically our theory or hypothesis about the way life is or should be. For example, ""They shouldn't treat me like that"" or ""I can't stand when they do that to me"". Does the evidence of everyday life support our theories or hypotheses, or perhaps refute them. Does it suggest an alternative and better theory or hypothesis?






The bigger the gap between our theories or hypotheses and reality, the more emotion we'll generate needlessly, and the poorer mental health we'll enjoy.
If someone's theory is ""They shouldn't do that to me"" and other kids are all the time, they're going to have a lot of unnecessary emotion - emotion that won't change anything
If they instead told themselves, ""Unfortunately, other people can say and do whatever they want, regardless of how much I might not like it"", their theory would be closer to reality, and they would still generate emotion, but frustration or sadness instead of anger or depression.


A final way to tone down demandiness is to have kids practice restating their demands as the wants, preferences, and desires they start out as. For example:






""They can't do that to me"" becomes ""I don't like when they do that to me"", which a kid has every right to not like.
""They have to leave me alone"" becomes ""I'd like them to just leave me alone""



,


Shame plays a much bigger role in kids behavior than most adults realize. Shame is what we feel when we believe that we don't live up to expectations in some way. Kids have all kinds of expectation on them and some put even more on themselves. Plenty of expectations means plenty of opportunities to feel shame.






There is often a background level of shame in most kids even before bullying occurs. That's true for both the bully and those being bullied.
A common way those being bullied will shame themselves is that they ""should"" on themselves for not being able to handle the bullying better on their own.
Shame also will cause them to keep what's happening a secret for that reason. Fearing that if others found out what was happening and how they were thinking and feeling, it would reflect badly on them. It will also make them less likely to seek or accept help that is available for the same reason.
Keeping secrets can be very dangerous because it allows those being bullied to rehearse and practice simple opinions about themselves, others and life to the point where they become so 'rutted"" in their brains, and automatic, that those simple opinions start to feel like facts. For example, ""This is awful. I can't take it anymore. They're never going to stop. Things are never going to get better"". Such thoughts can easily start to be the ""irrational logic"" behind suicide ideation, or fantasies about getting even with those who are bullying them, i.e. school shootings.


The way to combat shame is to try to logically convince kids that whatever they think, feel, say, and do is understandable given their age, what's happening to them, and the fact that they're human.






For example, you might pose this question, ""What do you think would happen if we put 100 other kids through exactly what is happening to you? Don't you think most would probably think and feel pretty much what you are?""
Or, ""What do you think would happen if teachers had to put up with this kind of torment from their fellow teachers?""
You could follow with, ""Is it possible that you might even be doing better than most others would, but just don't realize it?"".
If they are struggling, you could also try to make the point that doing so is part of being human, and that there certainly not the first human being to have to deal with bullying and struggle to do so, and unfortunately probably won't be the last either.



,


Normally, the best way to assert oneself is to use I Messages. However, with bullying that may not be the best way.






The best way for kids to assert themselves is to enlist the help of authorities like school personnel, or their parents






Shame and anxiety may get in the way of them doing so, and that may need to be dealt with separately with counseling.

Start with a white belt.,
Move up to yellow belt.,
Advance through darker and darker belts.,
Complete kyu advancement with brown belt.,
Achieve black belt.,
Identify stripes on belts.,
Ask the martial artists for details.",How to Identify Karate Belts," Martial artists did not adopt the colored belt system until the 20th century, and it's common for each school to use its own variation.Almost every school starts the beginners with a white belt.


A karate student begins at 10th kyu (student rank).;
, If students train regularly, they get to take a test every few months to progress to the next kyu. At certain milestone ranks, the student gets a new belt. Yellow is usually the second belt a student wears, at 8th kyu., This is the part that varies the most between schools. In general, students spend their first year advancing to darker and darker belts.


A typical progression is orange (around 7th kyu), green, blue, and purple (around 4th kyu). Many schools use a slightly different order, or one fewer color., The highest ranking in the kyu system is almost always the brown belt. The student typically earns this around 3rd kyu, and continues to wear it as they advance to 1st kyu.


The student has typically been training for over a year by the time they reach the brown belt. Many students continue to wear the brown belt for another two years after that, although they do get to progress from 3rd kyu brown belt to 1st kyu brown belt., The famous black belt is a student's great achievement. Contrary to popular understanding, though, this doesn't mean the student is a master. Completing a bachelor's degree is a good analogy: a new black belt has a broad understanding and competence, and may be qualified to teach others.Karate artists can still advance from this point, but the belt color remains black. They now use the dan ranking system, starting from the 1st stage (Sho Dan) and moving upward. (Note this is the opposite of the highest to lowest kyu system.)

, Some schools use striped belts in addition to solid colors. These stripes typically show that a student is further along than the solid belt, but not yet to the next color. These stripes are usually either white or the next highest color in the ranking system.


For example, if a student belongs to a school where the color order goes from yellow to orange, they may have a solid yellow belt. A few months later they may attain a yellow belt with orange stripes, and eventually move on to solid orange.
Some dojo signify dan levels (black belt ranks) with white or red stripes on the black belt. White or red tips or ends are also sometimes used.

, You may need to know the practitioner's home dojo to understand whether blue is higher than green, or what a more complicated system of stripes means. Also keep in mind that each school has its own requirements and standards for moving along in rank. A student considered a 7th kyu at one dojo may have actually studied longer than a 5th kyu at a different dojo. Talk to the instructors, also called sensei, who teach at the dojo to find out more. Many schools and organizations explain their ranks and belt colors on their websites.

Know the process.,
Once you have completed 6 karate lessons.,
To grade to yellow belt, do at least 12 lesson of karate, and know all the basic techniques.,
Get a slip from your Sensei.,
Make sure you are at least 20 minutes early for your grading, sometimes there are lots of people.,
Be prepared.,
You may get to watch the higher grades to kata and kumite.

,
At the end all the certificates will be handed out and if you get one you can start wearing your yellow belt.,
Once you are a yellow belt you will start learning more advanced strikes, block, stances and kicks, you will do kata and you can start sparring.",How to Get a Yellow Belt in GKR Karate," When you start karate you are a 10th Kyu white belt. This means you are a students who is 10 grades away from teaching a black belt. You don't have to wear a karate uniform at this stage, but if you do you wear a plain white belt. This way the sensei's can see that you are quite new to karate and might need some extra help.;
, grade to 9th Kyu yellow tip. This means you are now 9 grades away from black belt and have your first bit of colour on your belt.


You don't have to do anything special to gain your yellow tip. This is a reward for your commitment and attendance. It does take a lot of confidence to try something new and stick with it for the first 6 lessons. Your Sensei cans see that if you have a yellow tip you are still fairly new but will have experienced all the basics.

, Adults need to know a few more basics than the kids.

, If your Sensei feels you are ready they will give you a slip, which is called a grading slip. It will have your details on it and where and when the gratings are.


Evaluations are usually held on Sundays, once a month. Students will be invited from all over the region to grade. Usually you will grade with the higher coloured belts too.

, When you arrive you will need to sign in. You will need to hand in your grading slip and pay for your grading. You may also wish to purchase a belt. It is better to buy the belt at the start, because often they sell out or close the counter at the end. If you do pass you can wear it. If you don't pass you can just hang onto it until next time.


The grading will be like a normal class, you will do a warm up and then your basic strikes and blocks, then you will do some leg stretches and basic stances and kicks. You might do so,e combinations of moves and other stuff too.
Many sensei will walk around watching. Don't panic, they are mainly watching the higher grades. White belts aren't expected to be perfect to pass they realise you have only been doing karate for a little while.

, You might be asked to do some things you have not done before. Again don't panic. You won't fail if you can't do them, they are just giving you new experiences. You grading is just based on how well you do your strikes, blocks, stances and kicks.

,, It is very rare to fail your yellow belt, but if you do you can come back and try again at the next grading which will only be a month away.

, Get yourself some mitts and pads for sparring.

You'll want you and your partner to be wearing clothing that allows a free range of motion without being baggy.


When doing this move, to perform safely you'll need to grab onto the fabric of your partner's shorts/pants. Clothing that rips easily should be avoided.;
, Once you've mastered this move, you'll likely be able to do it with people who are different sizes. To begin with, you should choose someone who is roughly your weight and height. This will make it easier for you to get the hang of the move.


People who are significantly heavier than you may be impossible for you to suplex. Those who are too light might not offer enough resistance., It's best to practice this move on a flat, padded surface to best prevent the chance of an injury occurring. Pillows are not recommended, as the padding in these isn't intended to cushion the impact of a fall. You should also make sure your practice area is free of obstacles, like toys, trees, or tripping hazards.

, The classic setup for the suplex involves your partner being slightly bent at the waist. To get your partner into this position, you may want to pretend to strike them in the gut, so it looks natural for them to be in this bent position.


Many pro wrestlers will use a toe kick to the belly to enter this setup.You could also use a fake gut punch to get into position., Facing your partner head on, take your left arm and put it behind their neck. They should do the same to you. With your free hand, reach down and grab a firm hold of your partner's shorts/pants and have your partner grip your shorts/pants firmly as well.


If you or your partner are wearing a belt, this can be a useful handhold. You can also grab a handful of the fabric tightly., You should signal to your partner you are about to start the suplex by bending slightly at the knees. The key to smoothly executing this move is to be in sync with your partner. As you bend at the knees, your partner should follow the motion and prepare to spring upwards.


Failing to properly signal your partner could result in them being surprised. In this case, you might do serious harm to their neck.
Always be ready to stop. If your partner is unsure or doesn't feel comfortable and asks you to let go, you should do so immediately.
At this point, both you and your partner should be in a bent position, with your arms firmly around each other's necks, and your free hands gripped firmly onto each other's clothing., From the knees-bent position you should drive down with your heels and straighten your body until your back until is completely straight. Pull your partner into this upwards motion with the arm gripping their shorts/pants helping to lift them above you. As you do so, your partner should spring upwards. Guide them up over your head in a smooth arc with the hand gripping his shorts/pants.


Your partner should remain in a bent position until they have cleared your shoulder and is over your head. Straightening their body before he reaches this position will make it more difficult to perform the suplex., Once your partner is hoisted over your shoulder, all you need to do is fall backwards. Try to do this in a slow, controlled fashion. Falling too quickly can take your partner by surprise or result in injury to them.


Both you and your partner should be positioned so that when you fall, you fall flat on the meaty part your back. If you feel that you or your partner are twisted, try to correct this before contact with the ground.
Falling heavily while in a twisted position can do serious, permanent damage to your spine. This could result in a permanent injury, like paralysis, so you should exercise extreme caution., Up to this point, you'll want both you and your partner to have a firm hold on each other. At the halfway point between your upright, vertical position and the ground, you should loosen your hold on each other. This way, if something goes wrong, neither person is applying added pressure., This kind of suplex is very similar to the classic suplex. Get your partner into position with a fake strike to the midsection so he is bent over. Take your arm around your partner's neck and have them do the same to you, as you would normally. Then:


Take your free hand behind your partner's kneecap. Lift their leg so it is raised off the ground and bent toward your body.
Signal the start of your move by bending at the knees. Have your partner mirror you and prepare to jump into the move.
Drive down with your heels and assist your partner up and over your shoulder using the hand you have around his leg. As your partner will only have one free leg, it's important that you assist as much as possible without applying too much force.
As you approach the three quarters point to a vertical position, release your partner's leg and loosen your grip.
Fall the remaining distance to the ground., This variation follows roughly the same procedure as the classic suplex, though in this variation you and your partner are both facing the same direction. From behind your partner, take your arms and grip them firmly around the waist. Then:


Signal the start of the move with a bend at the knees. Your partner should also bend at the knees and prepare to jump.
Drive downwards with your heels and guide your partner up and over you as they jump. Make sure you grip them tightly while doing so.
Release your partner after they clear the halfway point so they can disengage and land beyond you and not on top of you.
Complete your fall., This version is a little more dangerous than others, so you should be especially careful. Face your partner head on and perform a fake strike to their midsection so they are bent over. Slide your arms beneath their armpits so that their arms chicken wing off to the sides. Their head should be positioned off to the side. Then:


Take a firm hold of your partner's shirt. Bend at the knees to signal the start of the move. Your partner should also bend at the knees and prepare to jump to assist the move.
Drive downward with your heels as your partner jumps into the move. Use your hold to help guide your partner, but when he is three quarters of the way above you, disengage.
Fall the remaining distance to the ground."

, This is the halfway point between white belt and black belt.

, This is the fastest they will allow you to grades. The usual amount of time to grade to this rank is about 2 years. But it can take many more years.

, You must do this before they will let you grade to blue belt. You also have to have waited at least 5 months since your green belt grading. For example if you graded to green belt in March you would not be able to grade to blue belt until at least August. The normal amount of time is more like 10 months though.

, To get this control, your hands should be placed on your opponent’s biceps, one hand per bicep. You should be just far enough away from your opponent to keep your elbows slightly bent.


Ensure your left thumb is on the outside of your opponent’s bicep. This will give you more control when performing the takedown., The precursor to any good takedown is forcing your opponent to shift their weight to your advantage. For the fireman’s carry, you want them either stepping towards you or straightening up. Here are a few ways to do this:


Place your hand behind your opponent’s head and pull down towards the mat. Their first reflex will be to jerk their head up, giving you an opportunity to shoot in.
Keeping your hands on the opponent’s biceps, push forward. Your opponent’s default reaction will be to push back to prevent you from gaining the advantage. As soon as you feel this pushback, stop pushing. Your opponent will start coming towards you, giving you the perfect opportunity to shoot.

, The knee should touch the ground between your opponent’s legs, slightly past their heels. It’s important to shoot as dynamically as you can, putting all your force and energy into this forward movement. Your left leg should stay outstretched behind you.

, This is an alternate way to shoot into the above position, particularly useful if you already have a strong grip on your opponent. As they come towards you, sweep your back leg around in a circular motion, turning your body 90 degrees. Your opponent will hit your shoulder and be poised for the next step.

, If they are pushing towards you, drop to both knees, putting your right shoulder forward as you catch your opponent. This will keep your shoulders perpendicular to theirs, making the takedown more effective.


Alternatively, you can fall to your butt to achieve this position. Simply take a large step forward with your rear leg, and let the opponent’s momentum drop you to a seated position. They will fall across your back, preparing them for the takedown., As your right knee touches the ground, the right hand should be shooting between the opponent’s legs and gripping the opposite leg. Your arm should be looped around the opponent’s leg, with your hand gripping the outside of their knee. Keep control of the opponent’s arm with your left hand, around the tricep.


As you secure your grip, make sure to pivot on your knees; the line of your shoulders should be perpendicular to that of your opponent’s and you should be on both knees.

, As you pull with your left hand, your right shoulder should come up, sending your opponent up. Contract your side, bringing your left elbow towards your left hip. Think about putting your left shoulder down on the mat. This momentum will send your opponent through the air, over your shoulders and towards the mat.This step is specific to performing a fireman’s carry in amateur wrestling. In professional wrestling, your opponent will help you send him over your side and “bump” (absorb the impact of the fall). Professional wrestlers also perform this move from a standing position, but don’t attempt this without the right training., As your opponent lands on the mat, keep your shoulder pressed to their body, following them to the mat. Keep your weight pressed on top of them to prevent a possible escape. Keep your grip tight on their arm as you rotate, bringing your left shoulder up and around until your right shoulder pins the opponent.This will provide you with better control, as well as allowing you to move into other techniques, such as a pin.

Start in a relaxed stance, shizentai.,
Bring your feet together until they are both lined up with each other.,
Step/lunge forward.,
Stand at ready, or repeat from the other side.

",How to Perform a Correct Front Stance in Shotokan Karate," Ensure you are in a natural, relaxed stance.


Your feet should be shoulder width apart.You should feel relaxed, yet be ready to move at any moment.
Keep your knees soft, not locked, and dangle your arms at your sides.;
, Assuming you are doing a left foot forward front stance, keep your left foot still and pull your right foot towards it.


Your back should be straight and your knees slightly bent.
Prepare to block by moving your left fist to your right ear and extending out your right arm/fist.

, Move your left foot out until your feet are about 3.5 feet (1 m) apart.


Make sure you stop with your feet shoulder width apart, else you lose balance.
Perform a down block by sweeping your left fist down to sweep away an imagined kick or low punch.
Rotate your body to gain extra power. Pull back your right fist to your hip; the pulling back (called hikite) at the same time as the block gives your body the correct rotation.
Tense your body and exhale as you assume your position. You are probably not striking or blocking anything, but you want to perform the technique as if you were.
Kiai if you want to show readiness.

Pick a type of martial arts to study: traditional, combat, or sport.,
Research the styles and their histories.,
Select a school to learn from.,
Consider who your teachers will be.",How to Learn the Basics of Karate1,"


Traditional - This would include learning and drilling all your basics such as blocks, stances, punches, and kicks. You will also advance through the belt system while training in the traditional style.
Combat - This is your self-defense. The ""best of the best"" schools will teach you self-defense in all 5 ranges of self-defense:

Long Range Combat
Mid Range Combat
Short Range Combat
Ground Self-Defense
Weapons Self-Defense


Sport - If you chose to train the sport side of the martial arts, you will learn how to perform katas and point kumite for tournaments;
, Before choosing which style you would like to train in, do a little bit of history on the style, and make sure you like it.


When most people think of Karate, they think of Tae Kwon Do, but in reality, there are so many more styles. In fact, the proper term for ""Karate"" is Martial Arts. Karate is actually its own style of Martial Arts along with Bando, Kenpo, Mauy Thai, Shotokan, Aikido, etc. Each style is unique in its own way. For example, people who train in Muay Thai and Bando are taught to be very aggressive, while people in Aikido learn to flow with their opponents movements in order to get them into pressure point holds.

, Choosing a school is very important, and it may also be very difficult. The first thing you're going to need to do is find the style that you'd like to train in.

, Another factor to think about when trying to choose a school is the instructor, or Sensei. Is he a guy who actually wants to train you, or just wants your money? A good way to tell is if he makes you work hard or not. Every time you leave class you should be sweating profusely! If not, then you may have a bad instructor on your hands.

"

Make sure you stretch before your training starts.,
Work out before you start training.,
Learn your blocks.,
Learn your stances.,
Learn your punches.,
Learn your kicks.",How to Learn the Basics of Karate2," Always get a good 15 minute stretch in, and make sure it covers all aspects of the body:


Arms, Quads, Calves, Groin Muscles, Back, Neck, Ankles, Wrists

, Usually a good Sensei will also have you do somewhat of a workout before you begin to train. One possible approach includes:


Regular Crunches - 10
Orie Crunches - 10
Full Body Crunches - 10
Cat Pushups - 5
Regular Pushups - 5
Triangle Pushups - 5
Knuckle/Fingertip Pushups - 5
Burpees - 5
Squats - 5
Lunges - 5 (each leg)
Burpees - 5
Plank/6-Inches - 1 minute

, Each style you train in will have their own set of blocks. No matter what style you train in though, in any good style, all of your blocks should pass through the center of the body. Here are a few of some basic blocks from Shotokan Karate:


High Block - take either arm and bring it across your body, and up so it is right in front of the top of your head.

Key points: Palm facing towards your opponent; arm tilted up at a 45 degree angle; are covers the whole head. This block is used if someone is trying to strike you on top of your head with their bear hand.


Forward Block - Take either one of your arms (which ever side your opponent is striking to, that will be the hand that you block with) and take it across your body so that it touches your opposite shoulder. From there, you're going to bring it back to its proper side (as the arm goes back to its correct side, your hips should move with it. That gives the block much more power).

Key points: Arm should not go past your shoulder; palm facing towards your opponent; hand should be as high as your head. This block is used to defend a round punch coming to the side of the head.


Cross Block - Take either arm and bring it up to your ear, and across your face.

Key points: Hand should be as high as your head; arm tilted out at a 45 degree angle; palm facing towards you; arm should go fully across the face; just like on the Forward Block, use your hips. This block is used to defend a strike coming straight into the face


Circle Down Block - Take either arm and bring it to your opposite shoulder, from there, let it fall.

Key points: Arm should stop just past the thigh; palm facing towards you; arm slightly bend; just like on the Forward Block, use your hips. This is used to defend a punch coming into the stomach.



, Stances are the very basis of your basics. Without a good stance, you can't do anything else. Stances are based on one of two ways: (1) that you are on a sandy beach (2) you are in the rocky mountains. No matter what stance you're in, your knees should always be bent!


If the stance is based off of being on a sandy beach (originated from Okinawa) then the stance is usually going to be very deep, with the feet far apart.
If a stance is based off of being on rocky mountains (from Japan) then the feet are going to be closer together with a higher stance.

, When you punch, always use your hips. Most people like to believe that you get power in your punches from your muscles, but truth is that 70% of the power from your punch comes from your hips. Some people like to punch with a horizontal fist, others with a vertical fist, but the best approach is to tilt your fist at a 45 degree angle, and tilt it down just a bit. The reason why you tilt it at a 45 it because it makes the wrist much more stable, and you tilt it down so that you are hitting with your first two knuckles (unit knuckles). Those are the only knuckles that have bones connecting to the arm bone.

, There are two types:


Snap kicks either hit with the instep of the foot to the blade of the foot, and they used just to lighten up your opponent.
Thrust kicks hit with the heel, and they are used to push your opponent back or may even be to end a fight. Every kick that you throw should have a chamber and a re-chamber. Why? Well, because say that you have two opponents, one in front of you and one behind you. You snap kick the opponent in front of you in the groin, re-chamber, then side thrust kick the opponent on your side (should take about 2 seconds). If you were not to re-chamber then it would've taken 4 or 5 seconds. That may not seem like much, but on the street, that's precious time.

Know why Katas are important.,
Extend your skills to working on kubuto.",How to Learn the Basics of Karate3," Kata is Japanese for ""Forms."" When doing a kata, you are doing a set group of techniques, so it's like you're fighting an imaginary opponent. There are three reasons for kata:


To built up your muscles and endurance
To help increase your memory
And for tournaments (for the sport trainer)

, Kubuto is kata with weapons, usually one of the 7 traditional weapons:


Kama - Used back in ancient Japan to cut the plants
Sai - Originally a pitchfork
Tonfa - The handle on a churner
Bo Staff - a long staff; used to carry bales of water
Escrima Sticks - Used to poke holes in the ground to plant seeds
Nunckaku - Used to crack open the rice cakes
Katana/Boken

Katana: long Samurai sword
Wakizashi - Medium sword
Tonto - Short sword
Boken - Wooden sword, used for practice

Understand the approaches to Kumite.,
Learn about Point Kumite.,
Learn about street kumite.",How to Learn the Basics of Karate4," Kumite is Japanese for ""fighting."" There are two types of kumite: point kumite and street kumite.

, Point Kumite is used at tournaments. There will be two opponents (same rank category, same age category, same sex) both wearing padding on their head, hands, feet, and groin for the boys. Punches and kicks can only be thrown to the side of the head, front of the body, side of the body, top of the head, and a controlled punch to the face (coming no closer then an inch). If opponent strikes to any other area then listed, or makes contact to the face, depending on the division their in, they will either get a warning, point will be awarded to other person, or disqualification. No grappling is allowed, and no kicks to the groin. Any draw of blood leads to immediate disqualification.


If someone falls on the ground:

They have 3 seconds to get back up until the center judge says got back to the center.
Opponent may still trow punches and kicks, but absolutely no strikes to the head are allowed, not even a simulation!
Person on the ground can strike if they get the opportunity.


How to determine a winner:

Normally whoever gets the most points in 1 minute wins



, Street Kumite is totally different from Point Kumite. In Street Kumite, anything goes. Grapples, takedown, armlocks, full contact. There is no Street Kumite at tournaments, it is only trained in the Dojo, and there are no points involved, even though sparring gear is still used.

Use just enough to maintain contact, and no more, to spare them any real pain. Remember:This is a performance, so just act like you’re straining to keep him trapped, instead of actually trying to.
Putting too much pressure down on their leg can cause them serious injury.
Everyone’s body is different, which means some people can’t take as much pressure as others.

, Most of your power comes from your hips, but John uses his hips a lot. Therefore, any attack that comes, try and use your hips.

, Bend your head downwards slightly while looking straight ahead of you. Walk with a very stiff, consistent movement. You should not appear that graceful.

, Now that you have mastered all five steps, it is time to learn new techniques. Get a friend, first of all, within your weight range. You do not want to hurt yourself if your opponent is heavier than you. You also do not want to hurt your friend if he is lighter than you. Challenge them to a friendly, wrestling match. The rules are simple, you start off in a squat stance, and your goal is to stay in that stance if you are ever on your feet. The way to win the match is by pinning your opponent or getting him to submit, this is a good way to practice a football tackle.

, It is time to learn some of John's tricks to how he does his movement. Buy a punching bag, first of all. Start in a horse stance which is like a squat stance, except widened. Your knees should not extend in front of your toes. Begin with punches and jabs while trying your best to incorporate hip movement. For kicking, just work on front kicks. Stay straight and try to not move from the position you are in.

, To make you a black belt your sensei needs to know what they are doing as well. Your sensei should be at least a black belt level themselves, they should also have taken many other students to the level before.

, It is almost impossible to make it to black belt while training only once per week. Muscle memory does not last 7 days, so people who train once a week have to relearn a lot from each training session. Twice a week should be the minimum for people who want to achieve a black belt and three times a week is ideal.

, 3 times a week training is ideal. If you are training 4-7 times a week regularly in most cases you will burn out well before you ever reach black belt. Also if you train too often it can be detrimental to your development as you don't have appropriate recovery time for your muscles.

, Practice your Kata, stretch, do some strength training, try out that combination you did in class. Work on the techniques that your sensei corrected you on that day.

, Some people get upset when they get corrected but those who take the corrections on board and try to fix them are the ones who make it to black belt. Remember every time your instructor corrects you they are giving you one of the keys to becoming a black belt.

,, Every tournament is a chance for you to grow and improve in your karate. Students who compete tend to develop faster.

, It takes many years to achieve a black belt, so if you just focus on black belt then this goal may be so far off that it is overwhelming. Focus on one step at a time, like getting your next grade.

, It takes an average of 4-5 years to gain a black belt in karate. Some times longer depending on your age, your natural abilities, body type, coordination levels, fitness levels, the type of sports you have done before, how much you train, how much you listen to your instructor and so on.

, Anything that comes up, do it.

, Your body is your tool in karate, if it is in great shape then your karate will be great too. Don't smoke or do drugs, instead eat healthy foods and drink lots of water.

, The biggest problem with injuries in sports is that people get them and then decide its no big deal and continue to train with them until they get far worse and its too late. Injuries dealt with straight away can almost always be cured.

, All martial artists go through ups and downs in your training. There will be times when you feel like you aren't progressing or even that you are going backwards. Even so, push through and you will always make it.

, The key to becoming a black belt is to stick with karate for the long term. If you have good friendships at the dojo you will be more likely to continue.

, Don't let karate be your only activity. It's a good idea to take another sport as well like swimming, soccer, basketball, gymnastics, dance class, athletics, visit the gym and so on. Train your muscles in a different way.

Orange belt comes after yellow, it is called 7th Kyu, which means you are 7 grades away from black belt.
After you have been a yellow belt for 12 lessons yours Sensei will award you your 7th Kyu ho. This is your orange tip, it is worn with an orange tip at the end of your yellow belt. This means you are halfway towards your orange belt. You don't have to do anything special to grade to this level. It is an encouragement grade.;

Assume the proper defensive stance.,
Have the arms poised and ready.,
Raise the blocking arm to meet the strike.,
Initiate a counterattack.",How to Block Punches in Karate1," Spread your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your center of gravity between your legs with the knees bent and the body stable and unmoving. Your weight should be positioned mainly on the balls of your feet. In age uke, the body can be facing the opponent head-on or may be angled slightly to present less of a target.Create a solid base, but stay light on your feet so that you can move at a moment’s notice.;
, To begin the blocking movement, your arms should be in a “chambered” position (fists clenched with fingers facing upward at either hip) or raised defensively in front of the body. This is to have them as close as possible to the anticipated strike in order to effectively protect the head and face. Your fists can be held open or closed, but do not clench them until the moment of impact.Clenching your fist creates unnecessary tension in the arms and shoulders, which can exhaust you and reduce your reactive speed., With the elbow bent at roughly 45 degrees, lift your blocking arm up and outwards in a tight arc until your forearm is held laterally over your forehead. As you begin the block, your forearm will catch your opponent’s strike and redirect their force safely over the top of your head or off to the side. This high blocking technique is known as age uke.Age uke will stop high punches to the head, as well as downward smashing strikes with the fist or a bludgeoning weapon.
Whenever possible, meet your opponent’s striking arm with both large bones of the forearm rather than the edge. This is known as a “double bone block,” and is much more effective at shutting down attacks as well as preventing injury., Now that your opponent’s strike has been deflected, their balance will be compromised and they will be open to a counter strike. Take advantage of the opportunity and strike back with a straight punch to the face or solar plexus. Both the block and the counterattack should be performed with quick, powerful motions, “snapping” the technique upon impact.Power in the counter punch should come from quick, twisting motion of the hips and shoulders, shooting the arm straight out like a piston. Make contact with the largest knuckles of the pointer and middle fingers to keep from hurting your hand.Your best target for counter attacking is based on your positioning in relation to your attacker. The head and body both make good targets when left exposed. You can also trap the attacker’s punching arm to apply a grappling technique. This will allow you to subdue them without having to hit them in return."
"
Adopt a stable defensive posture.,
Turn your body away from the opponent slightly.,
Bring the blocking arm up and inward from the hip (Soto Uke).,
Turn the blocking arm up and outward from the hip (Uchi Uke).,
Counter the strike.",How to Block Punches in Karate2," Sink your weight between your knees to keep from being knocked off your center of balance. For blocking strikes directed at the body, you may take either naihanchi-dachi (with the legs wide and the body facing your opponent) or zenkutsu-dachi stance (with the legs staggered and your weight positioned over the front foot). Have your hands chambered or raised to protect the midsection.It is critical to take a wider stance when defending body attacks to prevent being forced off balance by a strike to the center of your mass.
The lower you sink into your defensive stance, the harder you will be to move. You’ll also have a clearer shot at your opponent’s lower extremities such as the ribcage, solar plexus and groin.

, Rather than accept the strike head-on, rotate your shoulders and hips so that one shoulder is pointing toward your opponent. Angling the body slightly creates a smaller target for the attacker to aim for, making you harder to hit. From this position, you can decide whether to employ an inward block (uchi uke) with the lead arm or an outward block (soto uke) with the rear arm.By turning your upper body slightly, you “close off” your body, keeping your torso more guarded, and present your shoulder to your attacker rather than your chin.
From this position, punches delivered with the rear chambered hand will have the most power.

, With your fist clenched and your arm held firm, swing your blocking arm up and inward to deflect the punch. When delivering an outward block, your fingers should be facing you, and you will make contact with the inside of your forearm or elbow.Soto uke is defined as an “outward” block because the blocking arm begins its from outside the body’s center line and moves inward. Use soto uke to defend against jabs and straight punches.
Outward blocks divert the attacker's arm to the inside of your guard. This leaves you in a position to use a counter punch, knee strike, arm lock or throw. Outward blocks are quite similar to a boxer's parry.

, As an alternative to soto uke, you might be in a better position to employ uchi uke, or an inward block. From a chambered or defensive guard, raise and rotate your blocking arm outward from your opposite hip, catching the punch with the outside of your forearm.Uchi uke is known as an “inward” block because the trajectory of the blocking arm moves from the inside out. Uchi uke should be done to protect the body from looping “haymaker” blows, straight punches and hooks.
Inward blocks open up the center of your attacker’s body, allowing you to follow up with an unobstructed strike.

, Your attacker should now be in a vulnerable position with their arm fully extended and their face and body exposed. Continue diverting the punch with your forearm and return a strike of your own to the most sensitive target on your opponent’s body. The block and counter strike should be performed in quick succession as one fluid movement.Decide whether to strike to the ribs, midsection or face depending on the position of your opponent’s punching arm and the placement of your own body.

"
"
Get into a staggered stance.,
Raise the blocking arm to your opposite shoulder.,
Bring the blocking arm downward to neutralize the attack.,
Strike back.",How to Block Punches in Karate3," Place the foot corresponding to your non-dominant hand in front of the other. For example, if you are right-handed, put your left foot forward. Let your feet find a natural and comfortable position; the best way to do this is to take a normal step, then pause and stabilize your weight. For blocking low strikes, it is generally easier to defend from a walking (shizentai-dachi) or cat stance (nekoashi-dachi), as this allows you to defend the lower body without the legs getting in the way of the block.Gedan barai can be employed from many different defensive stances, but stances with the legs staggered are the most natural as they put the body in a less clumsy position to protect the hips, groin and legs.
In nekoashi-dachi (cat stance), the weight is poised mostly over the back foot, with the heel of the front foot raised to enable a quick transitional movement or kick. This positioning closely resembles a boxer’s fighting stance., Bring your blocking arm across your body until your fist is positioned beside your opposite ear. As you initiate the block, you will quickly reverse this motion, creating enough momentum to slow or stop the oncoming strike.In a downward block, the blocking arm should pass from the opposite shoulder down to the lead hip. Keep the fist close to the body and use the leverage of the hips and shoulders to stabilize the blocking arm.

, From your opposite shoulder, bring your blocking arm down and across your body forcefully to intercept the strike. Your fist should stop a few inches above your lead leg, forearm parallel with your thigh. Tense your arm and shoulder at the moment of impact to ensure that the strike doesn’t break through your defense.The purpose of the downward block is not so much to stop an attack outright, but to minimize its impact and do damage to the opponent’s attacking limb.
Gedan barai is useful for breaking a grab and defending against uppercuts and hooks to the body.

, Once the attack has been defended, launch a strike of your own to fend off or incapacitate your opponent. One benefit of a staggered stance is that it allows for greater diversity in your choice of counter attack. You can respond with a straight punch thrown from the hip, but will also be in a position to throw a kick or knee strike with the rear leg. Strike at an undefended point on your opponent’s body, and be prepared to defend against any other follow-up attacks.Though they are somewhat less stable than deeper defensive postures, cat stance and walking stance arguably offer a greater variety of offensive options.

Do some jumping jacks.,
Add squat jumps.,
Jump rope.,
Make quick position changes.,
Punch the air.,
Do a series of jumping oblique twists.,
Keep moving.,
Try the ""world greatest stretch.""",How to Do a Kung Fu Style Full Body Workout1," One effective warm-up is the standard jumping jacks that you did in elementary school. Stand with your arms at your side and your legs together. Simultaneously jump your legs out to shoulder-width apart as you bring your arms straight out from your shoulders and then straight up above your head.Do a set amount, such as 20 jumping jacks or 20 seconds of jumping jacks. Work up to more as you can.;
, Begin with a squat, where you act like you're sitting in a chair but there's no chair behind you. You'll need your feet shoulder-width apart. Slowly lower yourself down like you're sitting. You should reach a point where your knees are at a 90-degree angle.Now, simultaneously raise your arms above your head as you jump into the air from the squat position. Land in a standing position, and do it all again.Try starting with 5 reps and moving up to 10 gradually.

, Jumping rope is another good warm-up that may take you back to your grade-school days. Get a sturdy jump rope, and try jumping continuously for a set period. It gets your heart pumping and warms up muscles throughout your body.Do what you can at first, and work up to jumping for 5 minutes.

, One way to really prepare you for your workout ahead is to try some quick position changes that you'd normally need to do to move around in kung fu. For example, with your left forward, spring lightly forward and back a few times, then switch quickly to the right foot forward., Since you'll use punch-like movements in your workout, do some punches while warming up. Start by punching with one arm only, ten times in a row. After you've completed that move, switch to the other arm.Start with your left foot a bit forward. Spring forward a bit on both feet, then punch forward with your left arm. It's similar to a boxing move.

, This movement warms and stretches your whole body. Start with your feet together. Your arms should be in front of your chest, with your elbows out and palms towards the ground. Start by jumping in the air and twisting your feet and knees to the right, then jumping again and twisting to the left in quick succession. Your chest should stay forward. Keep going back and forth quickly.Try 30 seconds of this move at a time.

, If you need a break between your warm-up exercises, that's fine. However, you should still keep moving. When you're taking a break, you need to jog in place to keep the momentum going. Once you've recovered a bit, try another warm-up exercise.Make sure you're rotating through exercises. That is, you can do jumping jacks once, then go back to them after doing a couple of other exercises.

, This yoga stretch works to stretch out your whole body, which is essential when doing a kung fu workout. Start with a forward lunge. Step far forward with one foot. As you do, lower yourself towards the ground. The front knee should reach a 90-degree angle and the back knee should almost touch the ground. Hold this move for about 10 seconds.Using the arm that's on the same side as your forward leg, bend it at the elbow and lean as far forward as you can on the inside of your leg. You can try to the touch the ground with the elbow. If you can't touch the ground, just get as far as you can. Your other hand should be flat on the ground to help you stay upright. Hold for about 10 seconds.
Next, place your hands on both sides of your foot. You may need to support yourself on your fingers. Straighten your front leg up, moving the back leg as needed, and lift up your front foot's toes. Hold for 10 seconds. Move to put the other leg forward, and repeat.

Do an upward block.,
Move to downward blocks.,
Alternate punches.,
Try push-ups with extra stretches.",How to Do a Kung Fu Style Full Body Workout2," Make a fist out of your hand. Your arm should be bent. Bring that arm out in front of you with your forearm facing out. Your arm should be about waist level and parallel to the ground. Now, raise the arm up, bringing it in front of your face and then up above your head. Your arm should now be just above your forehead with the forearm still out. Bring your arm back to the start.Alternate arms for 20 reps. Start out slow, and work up to a faster pace over time. You can add more blocks as you get stronger.

, Begin in horse stance. Make fists with both hands, and bend your arms at the elbow. The inner arm should be facing upwards. Move one arm out in front, flattening out to an open hand, facing downward. Your arm should be at about waist-height.Move your arm down, pressing a bit harder with the outside of the wrist as you hit the ""bottom"" of the movement. Move back to starting position.
Alternate between hands for about 20 reps. You can move up to doing more and doing them faster as you get stronger.
For horse stance, place your feet a bit wider than your hips. Your toes should be pointed outwards. Keeping your back straight, bend at the knees until they are just over your toes., Start in a high horse stance, meaning don't go as deep as you did in the downward blocks. You arms should be bent at the elbow and by your side, with the underarms facing upwards and fists clenched. Start by punching one arm forward.As you punch forward, rotate the wrist so your inner arm is facing down by the time your arm is extended. As you come back, rotate it back upwards. Punch straight out from the center of your body, rotating your torso back and forth to punch.
Move back and forth between arms for about 30 seconds.
To make it a bit more difficult, get lower in the horse stance.

, Begin in a push-up position. Lay face down on the ground with your toes holding your lower end up (you can also use your knees instead). Place your palms on the ground (or knuckles, which is harder). Lower yourself to the ground, then bring yourself back up, keeping your body straight throughout.Try ten reps, then stop. Using one arm to balance you in the center, stretch the other arm out straight up from your shoulder. Hold for ten seconds.
Next, jump your legs out, and turn your body towards the arm you have out, including turning your feet. Stretch that arm up into the air. Your face should be looking upward. Hold for ten seconds. Repeat the whole movement on the other side.
Do another five pushups.

Perform straight kicks.,
Do round kicks.,
Work on crescent kicks.,
Try leg raises.",How to Do a Kung Fu Style Full Body Workout3," Start in bow stance by having one leg in front and one in back. You'll be kicking with the one in back. Place your hands on your hips in preparation for the move. Rock forward on to you front leg a bit to begin the move.As you move your weight to your front leg, your back leg should begin to lift off the ground. Keep it straight. Use the muscles in that leg to kick it forward, while pushing up with the other leg, keeping that knee slightly bent, not locked. Kick as high as you can and still keep your balance. Use your muscles to pull the leg back down to the starting position.
Try 20 kicks on one side, aiming for waist-high, then move to the other leg and repeat.

, Begin in a defensive bow stance, with one leg in front of the other. You can bring your arms up in front of you like you're getting ready to punch. Make fists and have your underarms facing your body with your elbows bent.Shift your weight to your front leg, lifting the back leg off the ground. Instead of going straight forward, lift it to the outside and bring it forward. As you bring it forward, move it from outside to inside.
Basically, you are lifting it and swiveling your foot so it comes up with the toe pointing to the other side of your body as the foot moves in front of you. Your knee should be bent until your leg gets in front of you, then you should kick out.
Your foot on the ground will turn, and your body will lean slightly way from the kick.
Do ten to fifteen reps and move to the other side.

, Start out in the bow position again. Bring your back leg forward, moving it a bit in front of your other leg as you bring it into the air. Now, your foot should go in an arch in front of your body. As you bring your leg in front of you back towards the other side, the knee should be facing your body and the sole of your foot should be pointing upwards. Bring it down the other side and back behind your body.Try ten reps, and then move to the other leg.

, Lay on your back. Your hands can be palms together on your chest, or you can use them under you to support your back/buttocks. Raise both legs into the air together, keeping the knees slightly bent. Lower them back towards the ground, but don't touch the ground.Do ten reps with your legs together, then try scissoring your legs back and forth.

Practice all kata (literally, ""practice form"") over and over.",How to Teach Yourself the Basics of Karate," (5+ minutes) Clear your mind of all thoughts; concentrate on breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth; steady deep breaths and a clear mind will prepare you to learn Karate. There is no time limit, but meditating for at least 5 minutes should clear your thoughts enough to allow you to concentrate. And yes, meditating can definitely enhance your fighting skills!








Forget school. Forget work. Forget family, problems, everything -- visualize them evaporating before your eyes. Once everything is gone, you should see an empty room, and in the center of the empty room, a ball of flame begins growing from the emptiness. This flame of firing strength and energy should represent anything you hope to achieve by training yourself in Karate. By the time you are done with your meditation, the room should be entirely engulfed by nothing but the flame.;
, (10 minutes) Start off by running in place or around the block for about 5 minutes; plus about 5 minutes (or 20 reps each) of push-ups, sit-ups (or crunches), leg lifts, and reverse push-ups.









Warming up is vital to your muscles' ability to do work. If you don't get them loose and ready before you start your training and stretching, then they will go on strike against you and even basic moves will be tough to execute properly.

, (15 minutes) Stretching all major muscle groups first is essential for a loose and limber body; get a book on stretching if you do not already know what stretching exercises to do. In Karate, stretching the legs is crucial to keep yourself injury-free.









Stretching comes after warming up. When your muscles have heated up, that's when they'll be most receptive to stretching -- when stretching will be the safest and most effective.

, To the untrained observer, karate may look like its about showy displays of violence. In fact, it's the polar opposite. Karate is about peace and, what's more, peace of mind. In life conflict is unavoidable. When this happens, it should be handled swiftly and with power. The result is a natural confidence that has an air of humility.









This is an art form that involves the mind and spirit as much as the body. All three must develop simultaneously for the practitioner to truly master this sport. While the body must remember how to move, the mind, in turn, must remember how to be still.
All of the martial arts begin and end with courtesy. There is very little that is selfish about karate. It is believed that in your devotion there is reward.

, Yeah, yeah, yeah, you wanna get to the fun stuff. Unfortunately, your kicks, strikes, and blocks will not be effective if you don't have your stance right. You wouldn't expect to be a great baseball player if you held your bat the wrong way, would you? Nope. The basics are what truly make a great karateka (karate practitioner).









There are different types of Karate. You'll find different stances are traditional depending on which type you're practicing. Most types of karate have some variation of the following three stances:The natural, or walking stance (shizentai-dachi) is when your front foot is pointing forward, back foot is out at a 45-degree angle pointing behind you. Your feet are apart at a natural, or walking, width.
The front stance (zenkutsu-dachi) islike the natural stance, but your feet are further apart and your weight is mostly on your front leg.
Cat stance, or back stance (nekoashi-dachi). Your foot positioning is like the walking stance, but your weight is mostly on your back leg. Your front heel, if you so choose, may be raised.



, The stances above are fighting stances. However, at the beginning of any spar, you'll need to begin with the ready stance. You have three basic options:









The ready stance in the Fukyugata series has the heels together and toes pointing outward at a 60-degree angle.
The ready stance in the Pinan series has the feet at shoulder width, toes pointing outward at a 45-degree angle.
The ready stance in the Naihanchi series has the feet directly together and parallel.

, Karate isn't exactly something drunk people would be good at, and for good reason -- it takes an immense ability to balance. That's part of the reason the stances are so important! They center your body, allowing you to be fluid while simultaneously strong. But that strength you feel in your stance can't disappear when you start kicking!









Always think about your center gravity. If you spread your feet, you lower it, proving yourself stability and more bang for your attack. But if you lower it too much, you lose mobility and speed. When it comes to balance, there is a happy medium you need to find.
While having balance is important, when you start having to defend yourself, you'll need to be able to shift that balance quite quickly as well. If you're in one stance too long, your opponent can easily attack you! Because of this, transitions between stances are important too.

, There are plenty of people (read: gym rats) who lift hundreds and hundreds of pounds but yet would not excel at karate. It is not about muscle -- it's about power and speed.









The two are highly connected. A longer route to your target will help you develop more speed and thus power. If you use your entire body, you will have more power behind your attack, and necessarily employ more speed. However, think of karate not as being able to move a large object, but being able to move a small object quickly and with detailed precision.

, (15 minutes) There are a few essential punches you will need to learn to attack effectively. The straight punch, upper-cut, knife-hand, spear-hand, elbow strike, and backfist, namely. Practice them in order and alternate hands.









Blocking is just as important! Practice blocking as though these were the punches you were being attacked with. Experiment with combinations and counter attacks. Defend, attack, defend, attack...etc.
For the record, your first two knuckles are the strongest knuckles on your hand. They can be lined up with your forearm bones (radius and ulna) to increase strength. The most common mistakes are when people have a crooked fist, punch too high or punch with their shoulder.

, (15 minutes) Ten repetitions of any kick will suffice in strengthening your legs. Focus beyond the target for maximum power, but practice the flow of motion to gain graceful fluidity in your movements; like a swan; power will follow.









There are five basic karate kicks:The front snap kick. Basically, think of your foot swinging out in front of you like you're snapping a towel. In natural stance, you draw up your back foot, bend at the knee, and snap (hence the name) your leg out in front of you and draw it immediately back to where it was.
The side snap kick. The same as the front snap kick...only to the side.
The side trust kick. Lift your kicking foot to your opposite knee, kick, and roll your hip forward. In the snap kicks, your torso stays upright. In trust kicks, your torso falls more in line with your kicking leg, coming down to power your kicking leg upward.

The guy in the gif above is doing a trust kick. See how his torso comes down?


The back trust kick. Like the side trust kick, but you're looking behind you and kicking in the same direction as you're looking.
The round kick. In cat stance, pull your kicking leg up toward the same elbow. Swing your hips forward and pivot, creating the ""round"" in the round kick. Then snap it back as quickly as possible.

, (15+ minutes) Find someone to practice with, and use all of your techniques to fight them for 15 to 30 minutes. Sparring will help you increase your stamina and ability to throw combinations and defend yourself against multiple attacks or multiple attackers, once you've mastered certain blocking and attacking techniques.








, Focus on one kata in particular for that session. Once you have it, you can move on. It's important to focus on lower level kata as well as higher level to refine and improve.









Be sure to revisit it once you do have it! After you master several, piece them together and work on increasingly difficult combinations as the days progress.

Some forms lend themselves more towards competition than others. Competitions often look for a form that is longer and more difficult and has a greater variety of challenging moves. Ask your Sensei for advice on the best form for you.;
, Without good strong basics (kihon) your form will look sloppy. Judges will quickly dis-regard it when looking for their champions. Focus on doing the form very slowly and perfecting each stance and technique. Have your Sensei watch it on a regular basis to give you feedback and video yourself doing the form so you can break down the basics.

, Some movements should be done quickly and others should be done slowly. At some points you should pause, while at others you move quickly. Breaking down the form into parts can help you work to out the right timing.

, Karate basics are not the only important factor in a high scoring form. You need to focus on your focus. This includes your breathing, eye contact, loud Kiai's, sharp head turns and strong movements. A kata without good focus and strength will not score well.

, Often, people are very good at doing their form, but when they get into a tournament and are being judged it is never their best as they are so nervous about performing. The more often you perform for an audience or have someone watch you, the better you will be.

, Practice as much as you can, at home and at the dojo.

, Ask your instructor and your peers to watch you do your form before or after class and get feedback from them. You can also video yourself doing it for feedback.

, If you look sharp and clean the judges will see that you take the art seriously and it can help your score. Make sure you Gi is ironed and clean and that your hair is tidy and you aren't wearing jewellery or bright nail polish.

, Every time you compete you gain more experience and you will get better. It's also a chance to get more feedback from the judges and watch other great karateka, all of which will help you get better.

, Visualise yourself doing the perfect Kata every night before you go to sleep and again when you wake in the morning.

, You should watch as many tournaments as possible and analyse the winners. What makes them so good, what are they doing that you are not. Try to add it in to your form.

, Many people change their Katas too often, they don't give themselves the chance to get really good at any of them. They think if a form does not win they should try a different one. But it is not the form that wins it is the time and effort that has gone into it.

,
Shoot your hand down, thrusting farther until you break the block.,
If you don't chop it, check on how you feel.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Karate Chop," Chopping with the grain makes the wood easier to break.


Choose thin, smooth board for chopping, such as slim pine boards.
Don't try to chop anything that is too thick or hard (3"" maximum is suggested to start). A cinder block may be possible if you have been training for a few weeks and yell very loudly when making contact.;
, This involves either standing up, with legs shoulder-width apart or kneeling with your knees vertical from your shoulders, two feet from the chopping blocks.

, Freaking out will not help since the key to successful striking is the mind, you want to stay as calm as possible before you strike.


Imagine your hand going through the wood or brick. If you can't see it happening, chances are it won't happen. This could be bad if it doesn't. Remain positive. Be one with the chopping motion.

,,,, Do not remove your hand from the chopping blocks immediately––your hand needs to go all the way through to make the break.

, If you feel very little pain, try to improve your speed. A little extra strength is also helpful for successful karate chopping.


The edge and heel of the hand can take quite a lot of force provided they are the parts of your hand that contact with the wood.However, as a learner, it is best to have someone mentor you or, if that is not possible, to bring down your hand gently and with repeated practice, increase the force.
If you feel great pain, stop for the day. If any serious damage to your body has occurred, see a doctor immediately.

, The more you practice, the better your accuracy and ability to hit.

, Your fist should be nesting against your side.


Your body should be slightly relaxed but ready and focusing on the target.
You should choose one of two targets. If you want to punch to the body, chuudan, aim for just below the ribs, called the solar plexus. If you want to punch to the face, jodan, aim for the face.

Practice safe wrestling moves.",How to Have a Homemade Wrestling Match1," Safety should be your top priority, as wrestling moves can cause be dangerous if not performed carefully in an unsuitable environment. They can cause serious, permanent injuries or even death.Choose a space where you won’t run the risk of running into walls or fences. It should be flat so you don’t twist your ankle or hurt yourself landing on something jutting out of the ground.


You’re going to be hitting the ground a lot, so it’s best to wrestle on something with some give. If you can afford it, the best option is to buy some gymnastics mats to lay out for your ring. If this isn’t an option for you, grass is also a viable surface to wrestle on. You just have to make sure you thoroughly check the ring for sticks, stones, and other debris.
If you are planning on having guests attend, take where they will sit or stand into consideration so they don’t interfere with the action or get hurt. Plan for allowing a good five feet or so between the edge of the ring and the first row of observers.;
, In wrestling there are heroes and villains, brave combatants and cowardly tricksters. Drama is half the fun of wrestling, so spend some time coming up with a good character and backstory. Memorize the important details of your backstory so you can reference them during matches and work them into your banter.


If you’re having trouble inventing a backstory, think about the questions it should try to answer: Why do you wrestle? What events shaped the course of your life? What’s your outlook on the world? Do you have any wrestling partners or rivals?

, Every wrestler needs a costume that helps display their personality and attitude. It might be a good idea to find clothes specifically for this, since they are probably going to be ruined afterwards. Be careful to avoid anything with zippers and metal buttons or spikes since these can cut you.


Thrift stores are a good place to look for cheap clothes for wrestling. They often have weird and funky items that are perfect for wrestling costumes. Make sure you can move around in anything you buy there so you can wrestle comfortably.
You can make your own costume if you’re feeling crafty. Buy some heavy-duty spandex fabric and some quality polyester thread for your costume. They’re stretchy, which makes them perfect for wrestling. Unless you have a lot of sewing experience, buy a pattern online for the piece you are trying to make. Use a zig zag or stretch stitch to sew a strong stitch that will stretch before it tears. , You need a referee to officiate the match. If you have a lot of friends who like wrestling, this shouldn’t be too much trouble. Give them a black and white striped shirt to serve as their uniform. You should create a set of rules that is agreed upon by all the wrestlers and make the referee responsible for knowing and enforcing them.


While the ref is supposed to call a fair match, it can cause a bit of fun and drama if both wrestlers agree to have the ref favor one of the wrestlers while officiating.

, The point of backyard wrestling is to have fun, not hurt your friends. Make sure you practice with them beforehand so you know how to spar without actually hurting each other. Practice a variety of moves like shoves, counters, clotheslines, dropkicks and leg drops. You can make contact, but don’t put enough force in it for your blows to actually hurt.Make up and practice at least one finisher, but do not attempt any moves that involve slamming the opponents head, neck, or back into the ground, as these can cause permanent and life-altering injury or even death. These look cool on television, but they practice for hours every day so they can perform them safely.

Make a cool entrance.,
Exchange opening blows.,
Break out the signature moves and finishers.,
Pin your opponent.,
Celebrate your win or deal with your defeat.",How to Have a Homemade Wrestling Match2," Your entrance should tell people about your character while getting everyone hyped up for the match. Consider having a signature song that plays when you enter the ring that gets you and the audience excited. In general, it’s a good idea to include the audience if possible. Something like tearing a sign supporting your opponent out of a fan’s hand can really make a match more intense.

, Don’t go for a crazy move right off the bat. You want to slowly build up tension and draw people into the fight. Push your opponent around and take a few hits from them. Don’t just charge right at your adversary and try to tackle them. You should circle around each other in the ring for a little bit to help increase the drama. Add more and more intense moves like body slams and arm drags until the fight has reached a climax and you know it’s time to finish it.

, Ideally you will have come up with a few original moves, since the overwhelming majority of WWE finishers aren’t suitable for backyard wrestling. They should be dramatic and incorporate showmanship, as these will be your finest moments as a wrestler. Come up with a unique name for your finisher so people will associate you with it. , Don’t drag out the match by sparring endlessly. When you're ready to pin them, hold your opponent’s shoulders against the ground and get on top of them so they can’t wriggle away. The referee should come over to make sure that they are actually pinned. If you can pin them until the ref counts to three, then you have won the match.

, Congratulations, you just finished your first backyard wrestling match! Did you come out on top or fail to beat your adversary? The ref will lift the victor’s fist into the air and declare them the winner while holding the loser’s hand by their side. Exchange your final words and walk off the stage so the next round can begin.


The way you end the match should embody the personality you made for your wrestler during the preparation stage. Sore losers should taunt the winner by insinuating that it wasn’t a fair match or otherwise insulting them. Good guys should win humbly and respect their opponent, but even they have their limits. Whatever you do, take advantage of the opportunity to let your wrestling persona shine through

Determine who breaks first by ""lagging."",
Set up the rack.,
Break by shooting the cue ball at the rack.,
Decide whether to ""push out."",
Begin normal play.",How to Break in 9 Ball1," Each player sets a ball on the table behind the ""head string,"" meaning between the end of the table and the second pair of ""diamonds"" or marks on the table's sides. At about the same time, each player hits one of the balls, aiming to touch the far end of the table and return as close to the near end as possible without touching the near end or the sides. Whoever comes closest gets to break.


Repeat the lag if both players hit the sides or nearest end.
If you are playing multiple rounds, you only need to lag before the first one. After that, players take turns breaking.;
, Set up the nine object balls (everything besides the un-numbered cue ball) in a tightly packed diamond shape. The ball at one end of the diamond is on top of the marked ""foot spot"" on the table surface. The nine ball is in the center of the diamond, and the other balls are arranged randomly around it., The player about to break places the cue ball behind the ""head string,"" on the far side of the table from the diamond-shaped rack of balls. (Remember, the head string runs between the second pair of diamonds marked on the table's sides.) That player then shoots the cue ball at the one ball at the diamond's closest tip.


In official rules, the break must either cause one numbered ball to enter a pocket, or cause at least four balls to hit a side of the table.If neither of these happen, the break is considered a foul, and the other player may place the cue ball anywhere on the table. You may wish to play without break fouls if you are playing casually.

, Immediately after a player breaks, that same player can declare that he will ""push."" If he does, he takes an additional shot with the intention of putting the ball in position; unlike with a normal shot, this shot does not require any balls to hit a cushion or be pocketed. The push out is always optional.


If the player does not say he will ""push,"" the shot is considered a normal shot and ordinary foul rules apply.

, If the breaker pocketed a ball on the break (not the push out), that player continues shooting until he fails to pocket a ball or commits a foul. Otherwise, the player who did not break has the first chance to play. However, if that player thinks the cue ball is in a position that isn't advantageous, she may pass and have the player who broke make the first shot instead.


The player who broke must take the first shot if his opponent passes. He cannot pass back.

Keep some space between the cue ball and the near cushion.,
When you first begin practicing, place the cue ball directly in line with the rack.,
Hit the cue ball in its center.,
Practice your balance and positioning.,
Use an exaggerated follow-through.,
Aim for the center of the one ball.,
Choose control over power.",How to Break in 9 Ball2," If the cue ball is placed too near the cushion, your pool cue will be at a steep, awkward angle, making it difficult to hit with speed and control. Place the cue ball far enough from the cushion to allow for your normal range of motion when using a cue, then add an additional 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) of space to allow an even flatter, steadier cue.Note that the cue ball must be placed behind the ""head string."" If the head string isn't drawn on the table, find it by looking for the ""diamonds"" or marks on the table's sides, and counting to the second pair of diamonds from the table's end. The imaginary line between this pair of diamonds is the head string.

, The more in line the cue ball is with the rack, the easier the shot will be.As you get better at breaking, you can try more advanced breaking techniques described below. But while you're a beginner, stick with the center placement.

, For the basic break shot, aim for the center of the cue ball, not above or below it.If you notice your cue ball has backspin or forward spin, try watching the tip of your pool cue as you shoot to look for unintentional movements. Practice an even motion while shooting, keeping your elbow level to avoid shifting the pool cue up or down.

, For a powerful break shot, you'll need to stay balanced as you hit the cue ball, then follow through by moving forward. Many players stand slightly to the side of the ball to allow the cue a full range of motion, and may bend at the knees before they strike, encouraging a fluid follow through.

, Following through, or continuing to move the cue forward after striking the ball, is an excellent way to practice and evaluate your break shots.Accelerate the cue through the ball, so you continue to move in one fluid motion rather than stopping or moving jerkily after the ball is struck. Keep your eyes down near the cue and watch the cue ball as you follow through. If the cue does not move in line with the cue ball, practice shooting steadily and accurately until it does before you concentrate on strength.

, The most common place to aim, and the easiest, is the one ball, at the nearest point on the rack. If the cue ball is not in line with the diamond, try not to let the diamond shape confuse your aim. Focus on the single ball you are aiming for, and try to hit the exact center of that ball.

, It's better to hit the cue ball softly and aim correctly, rather than break hard and fast but lose control of your cue ball.If your cue ball often misses or ""scratches,"" meaning it ends up fouled by falling in a pocket, try to shoot more gently. Practice stronger ""power breaks"" once you are able to consistently hit the center of the ball you are aiming for.

Place the cue ball near one of the side cushions.,
Practice getting the one ball into the side pocket.,
Practice getting one of the side balls into the corner pockets.,
Think about where the cue ball and one ball will end up.,
Find a new table's sweet spot.",How to Break in 9 Ball3," Once you've achieved consistent accuracy and power shooting from the center, try placing the cue ball nearer one fo the side cushions. Give yourself about 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) of space, or however much room you need to shoot comfortably. Most professional players start near this area when breaking in tournaments.


Some tournaments may require you to begin within a certain area closer to the center, due to the dominance of this technique.

, Professional players manage to pocket a ball on the break a majority of the time.One way to accomplish this is to strike the one ball, at the nearest tip of the diamond, and get it to rebound off the rest of the diamond and into the side pocket. Try starting from near the left cushion and aiming to put the one ball in the right side pocket, or vice versa.


Some players do not like this technique, since it can be hard to control the two and three balls which you'll need to hit next.Consider it good practice for pocketing a ball on the break, and decide whether to continue using it once you are more experienced.

, The two balls on the shorter tips of the diamond, or ""wing balls,"" can sometimes be hit into the corner pockets, although don't expect to get both at once! This technique will likely require a fair amount of practice. Begin by placing the cue ball near the left side cushion, and aim at the center of the one ball. Watch the wing ball near the left cushion and see where it ends up. If it drifts toward the end cushion, set up the rack again and aim slightly more to the right. If the wing ball hits the left side cushion instead, aim to the left next time.Once you've found a spot that consistently gets the wing ball near or in the corner pocket, practice the shot repeatedly to make it more consistent.

, Once you can consistently hit the spot you are aiming for, and rarely scratch or foul on the break, start thinking about positioning after the break. With enough control, and potentially by adding spin to the cue ball, you can get the cue ball to end up near the center line of the table, giving yourself a better chance at a good second shot if you manage to pocket a ball on the break. If you are not trying to get the one ball in, watch where it ends up as well, since it is the next ball you will have to pocket. Ideally, the one ball ends up near the center of the table, in line with the cue ball.

, Each table has slightly different characteristics, and if you move to a new one, you might find your breaks are not as effective. Move the cue ball around until you find a location that gets good results for your preferred strength and style of break.


Try to find a worn-out spot on the table's surface where many players have placed a cue ball before. This is not ideal, as you may have a different break style than those players, but it's worth a try if you don't have more time to spend exploring different positions.

Before trying to learn any specific moves, just roll your body backwards on your skates. Push yourself backwards from a wall, fence, or other object.


Start off rolling backwards on a flat surface. Then, as you feel more comfortable with the backwards motion, roll backwards down a small slope or hill.
Make sure there is no debris in your way as you practice.
Keep your skates on the ground. As you work on rolling backwards and going through your edging drills, don't lift your skates.;
, Before you hit the concrete, get the feel for some basic movements, like edging, on grass or carpet. Start with your skates in an inverted V position, toes touching. The skates should be on the center edge. Push your feet back and out. This changes your skates to the inside edge. Finish the movement by pulling the feet back together into a V position, heels together, skates on the center edge. Push forward, following the same path until your skates are back in the original inverted V position, toes touching.You are making an egg-like shape with your feet.


Practice rolling back and forth along the center and inside edges as you familiarize yourself with the feeling of edging.
Pressure should remain on the arches of your feet. Make sure you don't widen your feet more than slightly beyond shoulder width.
Edging is one of the fundamentals of inline skating. It refers to using the three edges of your wheel. ""Center edge"" refers to the part of the wheel used when the skates are upright and you are standing straight. ""Inside edge"" refers to the part of the wheel being used when your skates are tipped inward, towards the center of the body., Another technique to practice before you begin reverse skating is rolling with staggered feet. Look over your dominant shoulder to see where you are going. Place the foot that corresponds to your dominant shoulder behind you. This should naturally stagger your feet.Push yourself backwards and roll.


Staggering your feet will help you see where you are going and help you cover more area.
If your dominant shoulder is your right shoulder, your right foot will be the one farthest back.
Make sure your knees are bent. If they are straight, you will lose your balance.

, Practice rolling backwards like in step 1, but lift one foot off the ground. It doesn't have to be very far from the ground, just an inch or so. Your weight will have to be centered on the skate on the ground.This helps you develop skills and confidence that will be needed when you start more advanced reverse skating techniques.

, Step out to the right, placing all your weight on that foot. The left foot should help you stay balanced. Then, step to the left, shifting all your weight over to the left foot. Practice going back and forth between your feet, getting used to the feel of your weight shifting between each skate. When you feel comfortable with this, start letting the heel on the foot with all your weight on it angle out slightly., Knees should be bent. The body should be kept upright. Starting position should be slightly less than shoulder width. The skates shouldn't be touching, but don't start wider than shoulder width.Don't lean forward towards your feet while skating backwards. That could result in a fall on your face.

, Start with your toes touching, feet angled outwards into a V shape. Push out to the side with your toe wheels; do not push backwards in a straight line.When the feet are a little wider than shoulder width, start bringing them back together. When your heels almost touch, pivot your toes to push out, beginning a new swizzle. While doing this movement, your feet will be skating in a figure 8 pattern.


Don't go too wide with your swizzles. This will stall your stride.Make sure you feel the pressure on your arches. This means you are balanced. If you move forward to try to balance, you are going to fall.
A swizzle is a skating move using both feet where the feet move outwards from a close position, then return together in an oval shape. Linked swizzles look like figure 8s.This is building off the edging technique practiced in the grass.

, After you have mastered skating backward swizzles, you can move to skating with strokes. Begin just like you were going to push out with your toes. Instead of going into a full swizzle with both feet, push out sideways with only your left foot. This should result in an arc with your left leg, which is a half swizzle. Your right foot should remain rolling backwards in a straight line. When you bring your left leg back in close to your right, shift your weight onto your left leg and push out with the toe of your right skate into a half swizzle. The left foot should remain rolling in a straight line.This step is achieved by skating with linked half swizzles, similar to skating with linked swizzles like in step 1.
This step builds off the one foot gliding technique developed while you were learning the basics.
Before you begin skating strokes, you may want to skate a few backward swizzles to get warmed up.

, Start by shifting your weight back and forth between the skates. Make sure the heels of your weighted foot are angled out slightly. When you transfer the weight to the right skate, push off with the toe of your left skate as your bring the left skate off the ground slightly. Your weight will be on your right skate, and you will now be rolling backwards. As you transfer the weight over to the left skate, turn your right foot, completing a C with your skate. Do the same thing for the other side.


Practice making C strokes with each foot if you are struggling. Make a few Cs with your left foot, then switch to your right foot as you slowly move backwards on your skates. Remember the Cs will be made with the foot with the weight on it.
The arm on the weighted side will go back as your weighted foot makes a C, then come forward as the other arm goes back with the other weighted side., As you are skating forwards, place your weight on your right leg. Lift the heel of your left skate, pivot with the weight on the toe of your left skate, and shift your skate to a heel to heel stance. You will be sideways instead of facing forward now. Shift the weight to your left skate and pivot with the weight on the toe of your right skate, making the skates parallel. You should now be skating backwards., In the wide part of the swizzle, look over your shoulder, shifting your hip. Lift your right foot, moving all your weight to your left foot. Bring your right foot around, placing it on the ground in a forward direction. Push off with your left foot, making you glide on your right foot. Drop your left foot parallel beside your right and begin skating forwards."

This law tells you that the angle at which the ball strikes the rail is equal to the angle the ball bounces off at. In other words, if the ball approaches the rail at a 30º angle, it will bounce off at a 30º angle as well.

The law of reflection originally refers to the behavior of light. It's usually written ""the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection."";
, In this scenario, the goal is to carom the cue ball off the rail, and have it return to strike the object ball. Now set up a basic geometry problem as possible:

Imagine a line from the cue ball to the rail, intersecting at right angles.

Now imagine the cue ball traveling to the rail. This path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, formed by your first line and a section of the rail.

Now picture the cue ball bouncing off and hitting the object ball. Mentally draw a second right triangle pointing the opposite direction.


, In this case, we can use the ""Angle Angle Side"" rule. If both triangles have two equal angles and one equal side (in the same configuration), the two triangles are congruent.(In other words, they are the same shape and size). We can prove that these triangles meet these conditions:

The law of reflection tells us that the two angles between the hypotenuses and the rail are equal.

Both are right triangles, so they each have two 90º angles.

Since the two balls started equidistant from the rail, we know the two sides between the ball and the rail are equal.


, Since the two triangles are congruent, the two sides that lie along the rail are also equal to each other. This means the point where the cue ball strikes the rail is equidistant from the two starting positions of the ball. Aim for this midpoint whenever the two balls are an equal distant from the rail.
, Let's say the cue ball is twice as far from the rail as the object ball. You can still picture two right triangles formed by the cue ball's ideal path, and use intuitive geometry to guide your aim:The two triangles still share the same angles, but not the same lengths. This makes them similar triangles: same shape, different sizes.

Since the cue ball is twice as far from the rail, the first triangle is twice as large as the second triangle.

This means the first triangle's ""rail side"" is twice as long as the second triangle's ""rail side.""

Aim for a point on the rail ⅔ of the way to the object ball, since ⅔ is twice as long as ⅓.


, Most shots in pocket billiards are angle shots or ""cuts,"" meaning the cue ball does not strike the object ball dead on. The ""thinner"" (more glancing) the collision is, the greater the angle the object ball will travel at, relative to the trajectory of the cue ball.
, An excellent way to estimate this effect is to sight along the planned trajectory of the ball. At the moment of collision, how much will the cue ball ""overlap"" the object ball from your perspective? The answer tells you how ""full"" the collision is:

A dead-on shots overlaps completely. You could say it has a ""fullness"" of 1.

If the cue ball covers ¾ of the object ball, the hit is ¾ full.


, The graph of these two quantities is not quite linear, but it's close enough that you can estimate by adding 15º every time you subtract ¼ fullness. Alternatively, use these more accurate measurements:A direct hit (fullness 1) results in a cut angle of 0º. The object ball continues along the same path as the cue ball.

A ¾ shot sends the object ball out at 14.5º.

A ½ shot sends the object ball out at 30º.

A ¼ shot sends the object ball out at 48.6º.


, Past ¼ fullness, it becomes difficult even to estimate how much of the ball is covered. More importantly, the cut angle rises more and more steeply, so tiny errors can have large effects. These glancing shots require plenty of practice and good technique even once you've figured out where to aim. If you can, look for another shot you can take.
, If the description of fullness doesn't help you, try the ""ghost ball"" approach:Imagine a straight line segment from the pocket to the center of the object ball.

Extend this line slightly past the object ball. Imagine a ""ghost ball"" at this spot, squarely on this line and touching the object ball.

To hit the object ball into the pocket, you should aim at the center of the ""ghost ball.""


, A kiss shot involves caroming the cue ball off ball A so it can strike ball B. If you're playing a game that allows kiss shots, remember this rule: if ball A is touching a rail, the desired cut angle is ⅓ of the angle formed by the three balls.For example, if the angle with ball A as the vertex is about 45º, the cut angle you want to achieve is about 15º. The fullness rule above tells us that a ¾ full collision should produce this angle.


, Consistent stroke form and aim should be your first priorities when you start to take pool seriously. English is a very useful technique, but it has complex effects and you need consistency to practice it.

You'll have trouble narrowing down the effects of English (side spin) if you're not also controlling the amount of overspin and slipping. These effects are determined by the height you strike on the cue ball. Slipping is completely eliminated at 2/5 of the distance between the center and the top of the ball, but in practical terms 1/5 of this distance is often a better measure for optimal control and speed., As long as there is no English, the cue ball will come to a dead stop after a perfect head-on collision. Practice head-on collisions striking the ball with your cue at the midpoint of its horizontal axis. Once you can get the cue ball to stop dead every time, you have enough control to introduce English to your game.
, There are several types of English, but this article sticks to the most basic form. If your cue hits the cue ball left of center, the ball will spin along this axis — this is ""left English."" When this spinning ball strikes a surface, the spin will cause it to rebound further to the left than a ball with no English.Similarly, striking the right side imparts ""right English"" and moves rebounds further to the right. The further from center you are, the more dramatic this effect:100% English or maximum English means you strike halfway between the center and the edge of the ball. This is the farthest from the center you can strike and reliably avoid miscues.

50% English means you strike halfway between the maximum point and the center (¼ of the way from the center to the edge of the ball).

You can use any other percentage of English by striking at different points between the center and the maximum point.


, When two balls collide, the object ball starts rotating around a particular axis, determined by the angle and the amount of English. If you achieve ""gearing,"" this rotation occurs along the axis of movement. In other words, the object ball's motion is not affected by spin. It will travel exactly along the ""line of centers,"" or the line drawn between the centers of the two balls at the moment of impact.The term comes from the analogy of two gears meshing smoothly together, transferring the motion perfectly.


, Once you've aimed your angle shot using the fullness or ""ghost ball"" approaches from the last section, you'd like to ensure that the object ball doesn't pick up any funny spin and ruin your shot. Here's where a chart can save you a lot of trial and error. All numbers below are for ""outside English,"" meaning you move the cue to the side of the cue ball farther from the object ball.If the cut angle is 15º, use slightly more than 20% English. (Remember, the cut angle is the angle between the cue ball's original path and the path of the object ball.)

If the cut angle is 30º, use 40% English.

If the cut angle is 45º, use about 55% English.

If the cut angle is 60º, use about 70% English.

As the cut angle approaches 90º, increase English to 80%.


, If you use less English than the ""gearing"" amount listed in the last step, the cue ball will slide forward during the collision, transferring side spin to the object ball. The object ball will move slightly to the right of the expected cut angle. If you use more English than the gearing amount, the object ball will move slightly to the left of the expected cut angle instead.This effect is called cut induced throw: the cut angle transferred a spin which threw the ball off the expected path.

You can use this to your advantage to make seemingly impossible shots. If your only clear shot would put the ball slightly too far to the right, increase the amount of outside English to throw the ball into the pocket.

Ensure the balls are tightly racked.",How to Rack in 8 Ball," Most pocket billiard tables are marked with a white dot inside a black circle at either end of the table, about halfway between the corner and side pockets. The foot spot is the spot furthest from the end of the table where the players stand during the break shot.;
,, You may use any of the seven solid or seven striped balls. Many players like to use the 1-ball, but the United States Professional Pool players Association (UPA) Official Rulesdo not require it, nor do the rules of the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA).You do have to place the 1-ball in the apex position when playing either 9-Ballor 10-Ball, however.

, This is done to make it equally likely that either a solid or a striped ball will be knocked into a pocket on the break. If this happens, the breaking player usually elects to shoot at that type of ball and continue playing.

, The balls do not have to be placed in a particular order or pattern of solids and stripes, although most players try to balance the placement of solids and stripes to make it equally likely either kind of ball can be sunk on the break. The usual choice is to place a solid and a stripe side-by-side at the base of the inner triangle of balls (as shown in the figure.)

, This is done to reduce the likelihood of the 8-ball being pocketed on the break, which would result in an automatic win for the player shooting the break when playing under UPA rules, provided the break is otherwise legal., This is commonly done by pushing the triangle slightly forward and pulling it back while using your fingers to push the balls forward against the apex of the triangle. Be sure to return the position of the rack so that the ball at the apex of the triangle rests directly over the foot spot.


If the table has flaws that prevent you from placing the apex ball directly over the foot spot, the UPA’s rules allow you to place it within a dime’s radius (half the width of a dime) of the foot spot."

Someone at a general sporting goods store should be able to show you the proper fit. Children should definitely consider adjustable skates so they can grow along with them.;
, Because you're standing on carpet the wheels won't roll. The purpose here is to get used to the added height and to readjust your center of balance. Although you might not need it, a chair is recommended anyway in case you need the added support or if you begin to fall.

, You may be on carpet or grass, but you still need to get a feel for how to move your legs and feet. Take a few steps, then while standing still, move one foot forward while gradually increasing pressure on that foot until almost none on the other. Then, do the same with the other foot until you are able to ""glide"" back and forth the room a few times.

, Don't hurry the process and don't feel as though you're moving too slow. It's important to feel confident and to have strong mental composure. Don't get frustrated if you keep falling! Relax, take deep breaths, and focus. If you think you can do it, you will!

, Concrete is ideal due to its irregular and rough surface. Your wheels will find friction within these grooves but at the same time will allow you to move more freely than carpet. Asphalt, however, is not recommended for beginners because its smoother surface will force your wheels to roll more easily and you may not be ready for that. If you do insist on asphalt, though, choose a garage or patio so you can have something to grab on to if you fall. Also, make sure you wear a helmet and knee-pads if you are beginning!

, Practice turning, balancing on one skate, and walking. It is easier to do things slowly at first, then gradually pick up the pace until you can move faster.

, If you have to fall it is always best to try to fall forwards, sliding on your knee pads and wrist guards. If you feel yourself falling backwards, grab your knees! This will pull you forward, so you will either stay upright, or just fall forward. Make sure your wrist guards impact at a sliding angle--not straight down, as this may cause a jarring impact which can injure your wrists. If you can help it, try not to fall backwards, as you can cause damage to your unprotected back and tailbone. If you have no choice, attempt to stop your fall with your elbow and wrist pads and the soft side of your bottom--between your tailbone and hip bone--to avoid harming your back and tailbone. Try to keep your head from hitting the ground, but since this is a likely occurrence, ensure you always wear a helmet.

, Just like driving a car, riding a bike, or even running, anticipate where you want to stop. Move one foot forward and bend the knee slightly, applying pressure on your heel until you slowly come to a complete stop.

, Knowing the basics isn't enough! If, for example, your arms flail around every time you turn you probably didn't make the rest of your body turn with your feet. Putting in at least half an hour every day is a good idea.

Locate the diamonds on the table.,
Number the diamonds along each rail.,
Assign a number position for the cue and object balls.,
Split the difference to target the right diamond.,
Add and divide the ball positions for precise kick shots.",How to Bank in Pool1," On any regulation pool table, you’ll notice a series of light-colored dots running down the length of the rails. These are known as “diamonds,” and they’re an integral part of establishing precise angles. No matter where on the table you’re playing from, you can use the diamonds to sink bank shots with accuracy and consistency.The basic idea behind the diamonds is they help create “mirrored” angles. If you shoot the object ball into a diamond at a 45 degree angle, it should bounce off the rail at 45 degrees in the opposite direction.Lining up your shot with the diamonds will only work if you’re able to shoot straight and smooth, so be sure to practice your stroke to ensure success.;
, Beginning with the foot rail, count each diamond up from 1 (starting at the corner pocket, which is the imaginary first diamond). Do the same for the longer side rail. You should end up with two separate ranges of numbers, typically 1-5 and 1-9.The exact number of diamonds on the rails may differ depending on the size of the table—a 9’ regulation pool table will have 5 diamonds on the foot rails and 9 on the sides.
It’s not important for a table to have a certain number of diamonds. What is important is knowing how to use the diamonds that are there to determine your most promising shooting angle.

, Take note of where each ball is in relation to the diamonds you just numbered. For instance, if the cue ball is sitting in front of the corner pocket, it would be at diamond 1. An object ball just short of the far side pocket would be at diamond 4.

Balls resting between diamonds can be assigned an intermediate number, such as 3.5.Assuming you’re attempting a bank shot from one end of the table to the other, use the foot rail diamonds to determine the position of the balls in play.

, In the example just described, the position of the object ball (diamond 4) minus the position of the cue ball (diamond 1) equals 3 diamonds' length. Divide this number in half to find the halfway point between the two balls (1.5 diamonds' length away).You’ll need to aim for the imaginary diamond at the halfway point (diamond 2.5) in order to achieve a perfect mirrored angle and pocket the object ball.
Once you’ve discovered the correct angle, all you have to do is bank the object ball straight into the diamond and let physics take care of the rest.

, First, find the numbered positions of the cue and object balls and add them together—using the example positions, this gives you 5. Then, divide this number in half to get 2.5. This will tell you exactly where to hit the cue ball in order to get the object ball moving in the right direction.A kick shot (also known as a “lag” shot) is when you bank the cue ball before it strikes the object ball. This type of shot is useful when there are other balls in the way of a more direct shot.Kick shots can be tricky because if your margin of error is even a little bit off, the cue ball will strike the object ball at the wrong angle, throwing off your shot.

"
"
Pay attention to the placement of the cue and object balls.,
Draw a line from the mouth of the target pocket.,
Draw a second line from the object ball to the opposite pocket.,
Aim for the spot on the rail where the lines intersect.",How to Bank in Pool2," It’s important to observe where the balls are in relation to one another in order to select the right pockets for reference. Plan out your shot ahead of time by selecting a target pocket that you want to sink the object ball in.

Generally speaking, the best target pocket is the one that’s closest with the least amount of obstructions.
When sighting your shot, use the diamond that’s an equal distance between the cue ball and the target pocket.

, Imagine that the line extends from the opening of the pocket straight to the opposite rail. This is what’s known as the “cross pocket line.” Make a mental snapshot of this line and hold it in your mind.The cross pocket line is the one you ordinarily use to line up straight shots.
If you need help visualizing the line, try laying your cue across the table at the appropriate angle.

, This line, also called the “ball pocket line,” will run from the center of the object ball to the pocket mirroring the one you’re targeting. If you’re shooting for a corner pocket, for example, the ball pocket line should be drawn at the other corner pocket on the same end of the table.By using opposing pockets to draw your lines, you’re effectively sectioning off the table to create a central focal point.

, The cross pocket and ball pocket lines will form an “X.” Draw one more short line from the middle of the X directly to the opposite rail. This is the “bank point line,” and it indicates where you should aim to set up a proper mirror angle and sink a difficult bank shot.After you’ve found the bank point line, you can set up your shot the way you normally would, only with a definite visual guide in mind.
Use the diamonds to keep track of the position of the blank point line.
Picturing cross pocket lines is a quicker, simpler way to calculate angles during competitive play than counting diamonds.

"
"
Apply English as needed.,
Hit the cue ball with an appropriate amount of force.,
Try kick shots when other shots are blocked.,
Practice.",How to Bank in Pool3," Whether you’re using the diamonds or cross pocket lines, there will always be some degree of inaccuracy. By striking the cue or object ball forcefully at either edge, you can generate a little English, or lateral ball spin. English is useful for helping overcome imprecise angles and making sure that the ball enters the pocket from just the right direction.English refers to the left or right rotation of a ball, and is not be confused with topspin.A good example of when English might be necessary is when you have the angle of your shot zeroed in but striking the ball directly would cause it to deflect off the rails.

, Striking a ball with medium-to-high force causes it to skid rather than roll, which results in a truer banking angle. It also eliminates other factors that can interfere with your shot, like friction and drag from the felt. A gentler stroke, on the other hand, will give you more control over cue ball spin and English, which can come in handy for delicate shots.The power you put into your stroke will usually be determined by the distance between the cue and object balls, and between the balls and the rails., Sometimes, you won’t have a clear path to a straight or banked shot. In these situations, banking the cue ball off the rails allows you to bypass obstacles and sink a ball in the process. It will then be a cinch to pull off shots that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.Kick shots are also a good way to avoid fouls, since they don’t require you to risk contacting the other player’s balls.
Unless you excel at kick shots, it’s typically safest to use them as a last resort.

, When it comes to getting a feel for the table, there’s no substitute for simply playing more. Even if a shot makes sense to you on theoretical level, you might have to attempt it dozens of times before you get the hang of it. This is especially true of bank shots, which force you to analyze the table and showcase impeccable technique.Make use of drills designed to refine your ability to size up bank shots on the fly.Start challenging players who are more skilled than you to gain crucial experience.

Follow your optimum wheel size.,
Understand your boundaries as a skater to help you choose better wheels.,
Understand hardness.,
Know what factors into price.,
Start with your budget limit.,
Consider time frame and stock availability.,
Play it cool and make a considered choice.",How to Choose Inline Skate Wheels," Recreational skates wheel sizes can vary between 62mm for kids skates, up to 100mm (some even go to 110mm) for adult skates. Which should you buy?


First check your frames. Every skate frame has a limitation on how large a wheel can fit the frame. Dismantle your skates to find wheel size limit. It's best to go as large as your frames permit because the larger the wheel, the easier and smoother the ride. Literally you get more out of your skates with a bigger wheel.
The key is comfort, ease and moderation. If it feels too much then its not good for you. Very rarely does a skater get every thing right the first time they buy skates. Understanding who you are as a skater or what you want to experience helps a lot to decide which wheels are for you.
A note for aggressive skaters: small wheel size is essential to ensure flexibility in doing tricks but do check out power blading videos to give you and idea on what bigger wheels can do for you.;
, Believe it or not, even inline skaters who proclaim themselves to be free rollers have to stick to boundaries.


Boundary number one: Body weight
Boundary number two: Skate surfaces.
These two boundaries will help you determine how hard you want your wheels.

, Yup, inline skate wheels have a certain hardness predetermined by their chemical compound which is called its durometer. Usually indicated by a number such as ""82a"". There are more articles on this on other sites but what you should know is that manufacturers made wheels with you in mind, it's just they can't determine where you skate and how heavy you weigh.


A larger person needs harder wheels (usually 78a-90a) so the wheels can roll smoothly. Kids with wheels that are too hard might complain when skating on surfaces like rough asphalt (recommended 76a-82a).
Rule of thumb is the harder and smoother the surface, the harder the wheel; the more uneven the surface, the more the wheels need to be softer. Lighter people have more of an option (option ranges between 76a-82a).

, Prices vary and can run high, and the wheel choice can get complicated:


In the world of roller sports, inline speed skating holds a league of its own. In the 2012 world championships in Italy, all team managers where placed on their heads when the surface of the track turned out to be antiquated. The managers scrambled to get wheels for this surface, some prepared before hand by bringing a whole suitcase of brand new wheels. In the end most of the skaters had to individually test one by one which mix worked. The sizes were the same, just the brand, hardness, chemical compound and color differed between each skater. What's mind boggling is when you consider each wheel can cost retail between USD 25-35. Some of which were custom pressed for the event. The teams with the best wheel support dominated the races.
What's the moral of the story? Brands, year of make, which skate celebrities are using them all dictate the price of the wheels. Wheels can sometimes be hotter than the skates themselves.

, Ask yourself how much would you spend maximum on a set of wheels? If you can't answer that, ask the person who is going to buy the wheels for you.

, Get the phone numbers on who can provide you wheels, then clarify with them what stock is available, the price and if they don't have it, when will they restock? Never stop at one phone number. If they don't have a phone number or web page, go to their shop and see for yourself.

, Once you've got an offer or several offers don't immediately buy it, at least walk out of the store, get a cup of tea, put your pros and cons on paper. Then go back and buy it. Nothing hurts most than knowing you could have bought a better option.

Make sure you can glide very easily, and learn how to fall.,
Start out at the wall.,
Start the jump.,
Adjust as you're in the air.,
Just before you land, bend your knees so that your feet are in position to land.,
After you've landed, be proud of yourself.",How to Do Tricks on Roller Skates1," These skills are important because you have to glide for a little before you can jump, and then you are continuing with your glide. Also, if you don't land just right, you will fall, and if you don't fall correctly you could end up breaking a bone.
, Since you have mastered the basics of skating, it might seem embarrassing or unneeded to go to the wall again, but it will help you later. Hold onto the ledge of the wall, push up so that your feet are off the ground, and then let go and go slightly backwards. You should land with your legs slightly bent and your arms at your sides, barely raised. You might want a friend behind you to stop you from rolling backwards. This simulated landing after the jump. Do this many times until you are comfortable with it., Take a few powerful strokes and then glide. Bend your knees and get your feet as close together as you can. Now jump straight up. Your momentum will carry you forward., You must get ready to land, so straighten your body, with little weight forward. Keep your knees bend, but them behind you. This will help you from going too far forward., Make sure to keep your leg slightly bent. This is very important because if you don't, you could hit the floor the wrong way and off balance and break a bone., Make sure you keep your glide going because it makes the jump look smooth, even though it already happened. You will understand if you see someone else jump."
"
Master the simple turn.,
Pick up momentum and glide.,
When you are ready to put your leg down, shift your weight slightly forward on your foot that is on the ground.,
Practice this over and over and over.",How to Do Tricks on Roller Skates2," For a recap, you pick up some momentum and you glide. When you need to turn, you simply turn your feet the way you want to turn, and keep your balance., Now turn normally, but just as you are starting to turn, lift your back leg so that it is in the air. For balance, it is easiest to put it behind you, but if you don't want to do that, then try putting your leg behind you and then bending at the knee. This looks amazing, but it is hard to keep your balance while doing it., Then bring your other leg down and push off of that foot to continue skating., Soon it will be smooth and beautiful."
"
Make sure you're ready to tackle this one.,
Find a spot to spin.,
Try small turns.,
To start your spin, make sure you have some momentum, but not too much.,
Keep your feet in the position, both turning.,
When you are done spinning, simply point your feet forward.",How to Do Tricks on Roller Skates3," Spinning is more complicated than it sounds. You need balance, mastery of turning, and mastery of the one-foot turn (above)., If you spin too fast, someone might get hurt. Make sure that the area you are spinning in is not crowded., Maybe try weaving in and out of cones or poles. This constant turn helps your balance., You should never start spinning right after pushing off, you should start spinning in the middle of a glide. When you are ready to spin, start to turn like you would if you were turning a small corner., Make sure to do tight circles, so it almost looks like you are spinning on ice skates., You will start going forward, fast or slow, depending on how fast you spun. Don't get dizzy!"
"
Only touch your toes when you are gliding.,
While you are gliding, shift half of your weight forward.,Lift your other leg slightly upwards to help with the balance.,Bend down and touch the tip of your toe.",How to Do Tricks on Roller Skates4," If you try to touch your toes while pushing off with whichever foot, you could end up falling and getting hurt., Also, bring one leg forward. This one will be the one you will be touching.,,"
"Make sure you read all the steps first before trying!,
Start gliding.,
When you want to stop, act like you are going to turn in a small circle.,
Halfway through your first (and only) spin, shift a little bit of your wait on the inside of your foot.,
You are going to come to a stop.,
If you are still rolling after you did this, you might not have shifted enough weight to the inside of your foot.",How to Do Tricks on Roller Skates5,", You can't stop if you're not going!, To do this, turn your toes the way you want to go, but keep them turned., Do the same with your other foot., To others, it looks like you did a cool turn and stopped yourself midway., In any event, just keep turning in circles until you do it. Stop if you get dizzy."
"
Check your hand position.,
Assume the proper stance.,
Chalk the cue tip before every shot as though you're brushing the chalk on with a paintbrush.,
Hold your cue parallel to the table for maximum control.








,
Accelerate gradually as you approach the ball.,
Keep your follow-through straight and relaxed.,
Stay down after the shot.,
Practice your stroke without actually striking balls until it feels comfortable.








,
Imagine an invisible ball next to the ball that you want to sink into the pocket.








,
Place your cue above the target.,
Back your cue up and place the tip on the table where the center of the invisible ball (the one you imagined next to the real ball) would be.,
Keep the cue tip on the table.,
Set your shot up at the angle you just calculated.,
Start playing with your non-dominant hand all the time until a little after the time you become ambidextrous.,
Feel the wrap or butt of the cue.,
Check the shaft.,
Measure the pro taper.,
Know the cue weight.,
Check cue length.,
Pick your cue tip.,
Make sure no parts are loose.",How to Play Pool Like a Pro,"


Hold the thick end of the cue in your dominant hand with your palm facing upward. Find the spot on the wrap where the cue evenly balances. Grip your cue about 1"" behind that spot.
Make a circle with the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. Put the cue through the circle and rest it on the top of your middle finger, behind the knuckle. Spread out your ""pinky"", ring and middle finger tips to create a tripod-like support.
Place the ridge of your hand should on the table. Lift the other side of your hand a bit higher.;
,









Place the foot that is on the same side as your non-dominant hand in front.
Position your other foot about 2 feet (60 cm) behind the front foot.
Turn your body slightly away from the table so that it doesn't interfere with the shot.
Position yourself close to the table but not too close to the table. You want to lean into the shots a bit for more control.
Proper form requires the cue stick to be directly below your chin during a stroke. If you compare the form of a professional pool player with that of a novice pool player, the professional player will always keep their head down also known as ""being down on the ball"" with the cue directly below his or her chin during the stroke.

, Avoid twisting the chalk on top of the cue.








,, Imagine that you are moving your arm through the water in a swimming pool instead of hitting the ball with a quick strike. A longer stroke imparts more momentum to the ball.








, The cue should continue on its course and almost hit the table ahead of the ball's starting position. Your cue shouldn't slow down until the tip has actually hit the ball.








, This position allows you to analyze the angle of the ball and the direction of every other ball that it strikes. It also ensures that you don't cause the shot to deviate by accidentally introducing a jumpy motion.








,,, Angle the cue so that it creates a parallel line from right above the cue ball to the target.








, Maintain the angle that you just made when you lined up the ball and the pocket.








, Pull the rest of the cue around to the right or left until the cue is positioned over the white ball. You now have the angle at which you need to hit the white ball to sink the other ball.








, Strike the center of the white ball so that it makes contact with the other ball.








, It will make you less likely to win the current game but more likely to win future games. Sometimes in pool, you get a shot that would be an awkward angle with your dominant hand, but your non-dominant hand will gain skill faster for those awkward shots if you play with your non-dominant hand all the time than if you just do it for those shots. In fact, skill transfers somewhat from one task to another task to your non-dominant hand will gain skill for pool faster if you you do everything with your non-dominant hand than if you just play pool with your non-dominant hand like in other activities.








,









Choose a larger wrap if you have large hands and a smaller wrap if you have small hands. The most important point is to find a wrap that feels good in your hands.
If your hands sweat, choose a cue wrapped in Irish linen for absorption. Otherwise, choose a leather wrap or a cue with no wrap.

, Most shafts have a diameter of 12mm to 13mm. While 13mm is the most commonly selected size, a smaller shaft can make the bridge position more comfortable for people with smaller hands.








, The shaft maintains its diameter for 10"" to 15"" before it starts to taper toward the cue. A shorter taper gives you a firmer hit.








, Most players choose a weight between 19 and 20 ounces.








, Most cues are 57"" or 58"" long, but you can special order different lengths.








, Cue tips are made of leather and generally rated medium to hard. A tip that will wear well gives you better control of the ball.








, Any loose parts will absorb the energy from your shots and will hamper your ability to strike the ball well.

Practice.",How to Do a Crossover on Inline Skates," Try them on in good sports shoe retail stores and get some help from the assistant with sizing and fit.
, First up, you need to learn how to go forward and balance on them. Before attempting a crossover, you should already know how to move, turn, and stop.

, Even a pair of wrist guards can save you a expensive trip to the ER, so do yourself a favor wear the pads., This can be a skating rink, playground, basketball court or any surface that is flat and you have enough space to turn., If you can't do it standing still, don't try it moving. In this case, it's a good idea to grab onto a wall or stand on a rug and practice stepping over your feet. When you feel comfortable with the supported position, then try doing it without holding on to a wall or standing on a rug.

Remember to bend your knees and put your weight on the foot you are stepping over, you couldn't do it off skates.

, Move slowly when you are trying to cross over. Start off very slowly, then fully step over your feet (don't do a half step), while leaning into the turn. Once you've done it, take your back foot and put it next to your other foot and regain your balance., Start to turn left and while doing so take your right foot and put it over your left foot, pushing with your right foot until your left foot is in front of your right foot again. Don't trip over your left foot, you must move it out of the way.

,,, Don't expect to do ten of them in a row flawlessly. Just practice doing it and and try to do it going faster and cross over again with less time to recover."

Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, at a right angle to your target.,
Grip the bow so the weight balances in the space between your thumb and fingers.,
Notch an arrow into the rest, then snap it into the notch.,
Attach your mechanical release to the bowstring where the arrow attaches.,
Keep your eyes on the target and your chin parallel to the ground.,
Understand your aiming sight helps you determine arrow distance.",How to Correctly Shoot a Compound Bow1," Stand so that your left side faces the target. You'll want to straddle the shooting ""line"", an imaginary line from you to your target. So, if you shoot right handed, have your right foot (back foot) slightly in front of this line. Your toes should face forward in a way that feels comfortable; they don't have to point at the target.


If you're left-handed, your right foot will lead, and you'll face your right side at the target.;
, You want the grip in the center of your palm, evenly distributing the weight across your whole arm. Don't rely on wrist strength (bow too far back) or finger strength (too far forwards) to hold onto the bow.









Keep your grip calm and loose, not choking the bow to death. Gripping too tightly causes the bow to torque (twist when fired)., Pull the back of the arrow into the string until it clicks into place along the nocking point. The string will have a small area with an extra string looping on it, forming a small semi-circle (called the ""D-loop). The arrow is locked into the straight part, and you use the curved line to pull the string back.








, If you prefer to pull and release the string with your fingers, skip this step. However, most compound hunters used the mechanical release. Attach the release to your wrist as instructed, then simply snap the jaws of the release around the D-loop.









Keep your index finger behind the trigger to prevent it from releasing accidentally.

, Strong posture is key to accurate shooting. So is staying still. Once you've planted your feet, found your target, and notched the boy, keep yourself in this angle and keep your eyes on the target -- the less you move, the less likely the arrow is to move off-target.







, The line of vertical dots on the sight seem intimidating at first, but they are there to help you determine shooting distance. The top dot is where you aim if the target is 20 yards away. This is true for every single compound bow. The rest of the dots are for other distances -- commonly 30, 40, and 50 yards -- but different bows will have different distances on each sight. Many of them are adjustable as well, so check out the manual for your compound bow if you're confused.

Hold your bow at a right angle from the floor, pointing towards your target.,
Draw the bow straight back, using your extended arm as a guide.,
With the bow pulled all the way back, find your personal anchor point -- the place where you have the bow drawn fully back against your cheek.,
Form a second anchor point with the tip of your nose on the string.,
Align the pin on your sight with the center of your target, then make any final aiming adjustments.,
Release the trigger by slowly laying your finger down, not pulling.",How to Correctly Shoot a Compound Bow2," Hold your bow up and keep your grip on it loose so you don't hurt your wrist. Keep a slight bend in your elbow. This is not only more comfortable, it keeps you from twanging your arm with the string as the arrow releases.








, You want to pull the bow back in a solid, fluid motion, keeping your bow arm straight on target the whole time. Your arm, extended in front of you, is a naturally straight line that you can use to guide your motion smoothly. For added drawing power, think about rotating your shoulder backward as you pull back, keeping the rest of the body in place. This activates your back muscles for added control. If you need a little extra power, you can slightly push the bow forward as you draw as well, though this should be avoided if possible.








Your hips, bow arm, and feet should all be still while drawing.
Avoid the temptation to move the bow around as you draw back. While moving forward slightly is common, don't point the bow up or down as you draw back.
Once you have an arrow on the bow, treat it like a loaded gun. It only points at your target.


, The anchor point is a personal spot every archer draws the bow back to. It can be anywhere, such as your thumb touching your ear, or your knuckles touching your cheek. The point is that you have a regular, common spot that you hit every single time when drawing the bow back.









Play with your anchor point to find what is comfortable at first. However, once you find one you want to pull back to this point every single time. Keeping your anchor point regular lets you find and fix issues if you start missing the target.

, Try to put your nose against the string, as this will act as a second anchor and increases accuracy. It is not essential but is quite useful. That said, do not bend your neck to force your nose onto the string, as this will affect accuracy and can be quite uncomfortable.








, If you've been keeping your body still and relaxed throughout the motion, this should require only brief adjustments. If you moved the bow around a lot, you'll likely have to re-aim completely. Remember that your first pin is set for a target 20 yards away, and every pin beneath this is for further distances.









Any aiming should be done with small motions, rotating from the hips.

, Don't pull the release trigger as if you were a movie star with a gun. Pulling hard on the trigger naturally moves the bow slightly hurting accuracy. Instead, let your finger smoothly pull back the trigger. You should almost be surprised by the release. Many archers keep moving their hands back smoothly even after the trigger is released to ensure the motion remains smooth.








Be ready for a somewhat surprising release of force that can cause you to suddenly jerk. Prepare to keep your head down and body still.
If you don't use a mechanical release, simply let go of your fingers while pulling back, getting them out of the way as you release.

"
Focus on calm, fluid motions for all of your movements.,
Keep the bow aimed and even with the target throughout your draw.,
Hold your bow in line with the target after the shot.,
Lower the draw weight if you have trouble pulling the bow smoothly.,
Adjust your sight if your form feels good but your accuracy is still lacking.",How to Correctly Shoot a Compound Bow3," Tense, tight muscles and jerky movements will greatly hurt your accuracy. So will trying to aim and shoot as quickly as you possibly can. Settle down, take a deep breath, and let your muscles relax. Try to think of gliding through every motion, working fluidly from one movement to the next.









Your stabilizing elbow (left arm) should be slightly bent at the elbow.
Keep your shoulders relaxed and chin up.
Your knees should be slightly bent., Moving the bow, such as pointing upwards while you aim, may feel like it is easier. But it is a bad habit that simply forces you to re-aim, and the constant movement is not only unhelpful, it could be dangerous if you don't have full control over the bow.







, A big mistake of beginners is immediately lowering the bow after firing the shot. Just like a golfer must keep their head down through the swing to keep their body aligned, you should keep your bow up through the entire shot to ensure you don't pull off target at the last moment. Focus on keeping the bow on target for 1-2 seconds after firing.







, The draw weight determines how hard you need to pull back on the string to fire the arrow. Too high and you'll ruin your form trying to get enough power -- too low and you'll have to pull the arrow back farther back to get the same shot. Many people start with 10lbs of draw weight. Typical draw weights by person include:









Child -- 15-25 lbs
Women & Teenagers-- 30-40 lbs
Men -- 40-55 lbs
Bowhunters-- 50-65 lbs, You'll see that over time your arrows will start coming together into a tight grouping. When all shot arrows stay close together, but not in the center of the target, then you will need to adjust your sight. This is easily done, usually with the aid of some Allen keys. To adjust the sight, move the pins with the arrow. If you shoot to the left of center, move your sight to the left. Re-tighten the screws and try again, re-adjusting as necessary.

Inline skates should fit quite snugly, with your heel up against the back of the skate, supporting your ankles upright without becoming uncomfortable. It's important to avoid skates that are loose in any way, which can result in broken or sprained ankles quite easily.


Inline skates come in different types: multi-use, speed skates, street and stunt skates, and specialty cross-training skates. Basic multi-use skates are fine when you're just starting out. Try on different pairs to see which feel the best.
Stand up in the skate. Your heels should fit firm and not be sliding in the boot and you should be able to wiggle your toes. Check that the inner liner is thick and has extra padding around the toe for comfort.;
, Never inline skate without wearing a helmet to help protect your head from falls. Add some reflective tape and it'll also alert drivers to your presence when it's poor visibility. Get a helmet with a safety standard mark on it.


Helmets should be Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) certified for use in skating, and should fit snugly on the head. Get a helmet with an adjustable chin strap, and tighten the strap so the helmet won't rock on the head.

, You might see people skating without any safety gear whatsoever, but it's important to use the some basic safety equipment when you're first starting out. It's inexpensive and will help to keep your from costly and serious injuries. You'll want to get:


Wrist guards. Standard guards will cover the top area of your hand. Some wrist guards also have a ""skid pad"" that covers the palm of your hand.
Elbow pads. Fitting around the area of your elbow, these protect the fragile elbow region from falls.
Knee pads. Ensure that these fit snugly around the knees and can be secured fast to prevent movement while you're skating.

, Wear long sleeves and comfortable clothes when you skate, to protect yourself from scrapes. Since inline skating is a workout, wear clothes that breathe well and choose clothes that move easily and aren't too heavy to help keep yourself cool.

, Just because you get better at skating doesn't mean you're invincible. You'll still trip over a stick or a pebble eventually. You'll still fall. Protective gear is important to prevent breakages and other problems from falls on hard surfaces. Don't try to be tough and go without them, or you risk serious injury.

, Empty parking lots, walking paths, and other flat even concrete areas are great for practicing your skating. Make sure that skating is permitted so that you won't be in anyone's way.


Look for unused parking lots. Check out businesses on the weekends for big open spaces that are perfect for practicing.
Look in your local parks. Pathways and play areas might be suitable for inline skating. Just be sure it's not forbidden and that you won't be in the way of other park users.
Special skate parks are common in many areas, but avoid going to a skate-park when you're first starting out. These are great when you're experienced, but can be a little intimidating and fast-paced when you're first starting out.

, Stand near a wall or other support for this exercise in the ""ready position,"" with your feet approximately 6-10 in. (15-25 cm.) apart, with your knees bent and pushed forward in a V-position.


Another way to stand up is to start with knees on the floor and the rest of your body upright. Then, keeping one foot kneeled down, bring the other foot forward such that the skate is on the floor (keep the skate in a diagonal position). Keeping your palms on the floor to form a diamond or triangle shape, repeat the previous step with the other foot. Then place your palms on your knees and slowly stand up without completely straightening out your knees.
Lean forward slightly from your waist and put your arms out in front of you to hold your balance. Look straight ahead. Practice balancing in this position initially to get a feel for the position and the skates.
Keep your feet shoulder width apart and your knees flexed slightly to keep yourself balanced and stable.
Initially, you might like to try getting used to the feeling of your skates by walking around a bit on the grass. Then, return to a smooth surface and adopt the ready position.

, When you first start skating, it'll feel a little like you're just walking on a slippery pair of shoes. Learning to keep your weight on top of the skates is the best way to learn. Take small steps before you push off too hard and really get rolling, or your feet will slip out from under you.


As you practice, try going a little faster each time to encourage your sense of balance with movement. Keep your speed moderate.
You'll probably find your feet moving further apart as you try to maintain your balance. Stay balanced and go with it, and practice bringing your feet back closer together.
Try the v-walk which is taking small step with one foot by placing it in a diagonal and repeating the same with the other foot such that they form a v again. However, don't join them such that the skates bang into each other and knock you over. Once you master this, increase the pace and step size bit by bit, without losing balance, and you will begin skating.

, When you take a step forward with one foot, push off with the other and glide forward on your set foot. Bring your push-off foot forward after the step and shift your weight to it. Then pushing off with your other foot. Keep alternating feet. You're skating.Learn to balance on each leg as you glide. Transfer the weight from your back foot to your front foot as you do the push and glide movement. Do this really slowly to begin with, until it begins to feel normal.
Practice skating on one foot only after a while. The more comfortable you are on each foot independently, the better a skater you'll be. Glide on the left foot, then on the right foot, in turns, and have the non-gliding foot off the ground to get extra comfortable.

, While some beginners like to stop by crashing into something, there are a variety of different ways to stop once you've gotten started that don't involve slamming into a wall. You'll become more comfortable on your skates if you can learn to stop comfortably.


Most inline skates are fitted with brake pads at the back. To stop, put one foot in front of the other and lift the toe of the front foot while leaning backward, to help the heel brake rub on the ground to slow you down. Go slowly to practice.When you get more comfortable on your skates, you can turn your ankles in or out to form a V shape, or putting one skate perpendicular to the other to make a T-shape. This is a technique commonly used on ice skates, allowing you to use the wheels like brakes that slow you down.

Lean forward, shifting the weight to the forward foot by bending your forward knee.
Place the back foot such that the knee is straightened out and the skate wheels are sliding against the ground, almost flat on the ground.
Increase the pressure on the back foot by flicking it and locking the foot firmly in that position to make a smooth stop
Start practicing this method once you are an intermediate skater. Practice by keeping the foot without the braking pad as the back foot and once you master this brake, the braking pad can be removed and you can practice with the other foot too.


Use brake pads after slowing down using other methods if you were going at very high speeds. Otherwise the pads could get damaged very easily.

, When you fall, bend your knees, put out your arms, and fall forward to catch your weight on your wrist-guards and glide to a stop. If you do it right you should fall right on your knee pads and other pads, and you'll be able to get back up and try again.


Every skater falls eventually. Usually, it'll happen not when you're first starting out but can occur when you get a little comfortable and cocky. It's important to always wear your protective pads to keep yourself as safe as possible.

, It's important to skate at a moderate speed, even as you get more and more comfortable. It's fun to go fast, of course, but it's important to stay aware of obstacles that might be in your way to keep yourself as safe as possible.

, It's your responsibility as a skater to be alert for others around you, not the other way around. Show other users of walkways, parks, and the like that your skating doesn't threaten their enjoyment either. Things to bear in mind include:


Always keep an eye out for pedestrians, strollers, young children, people who haven't noticed your presence, bicycle riders and any sudden changes around you.

, Once you're comfortable with balance, gliding along and stopping, you can start to learn more advanced elements of inline skating, such as making turns and then getting ready for ramps, racing, grinding and even competing.

Figure out what you will be using the crossbow for.,
Factor in overall velocity of the crossbow.,
See what the draw weight rating is.,
Consider what broadheads you're looking to use.,
Buy and use your crossbow.",How to Buy a Crossbow," First thing first, realize what you're going to be using the crossbow for. Hunting or simply target shooting? If target shooting, a relatively cheap crossbow is a great option mainly because reliability and velocity won't factor in as much. However, if you are planning to hunt yearly, then selecting a trusted name brand with great reviews, will be what you should do.;
, While shopping around, the velocity is referred to as FPS (feet per second). This indicates the speed, and ultimately how much force each arrow punches through. Anything below 200FPS is reserved for small game hunting, or simply target practice. And 201-410 is for medium to big game hunting, which is often found in more expensive crossbows. $175+

, Generally speaking, for hunting purposes, anything above 120 feet (36.6 m)-lbs is great! But anything below will start to decrease in performance, such as the mini crossbows.

, Fixed or mechanical? Fixed broadheads will often be more reliable due to no moving parts, but also they tend to have a cleaner puncture. Mechanical broadheads are less of velocity and more of damage causers. Hunting big game like Elk and Grizzly may require damaging broadheads. That's where mechanically operated broadheads come into play. (After use, always sharpen them to maximize effectiveness during hunting.)

, Assuming you know what you'll be using your crossbow for, what velocity would be best for you, the draw weight that will do the job, and which type of broadheads would do the best job.. you are now ready to start hunting! Remember to always have the proper permits when hunting in your area, because no one here wants legal trouble.

Install all accessories first.,
Use a bow square or other tool to center your arrow rest with the nocking point on your bowstring.,
Make sure you are using the correct arrows for the way your bow is set up.,
Frame a piece of paper a few feet in front of an arrow backstop.,
Shoot a fletched arrow at the target, through the paper.,
Examine the hole your arrow made in the paper.,
Adjust the nocking point based on the vertical appearance of the hole.,
Eliminate side-to-side wobbling.,
Test again from further away.",How to Tune a Bow1," Don't adjust your bow until you have installed any optional accessories you plan on using, including silencers, balancing weights, an arrow rest, and sights. Any accessory can potentially affect how the bow shoots.Install your peep sight through the string, if used.
Install any silencers you will want to use.
Choose an arrow rest. There are several types, common ones include biscuit rests, flipper rests, and others.;
, This point should be about one arrow diameter square from the string, above the bottom of the arrow rest.

, Arrows with too much or too little spine, or that are too short or two long for your draw length will make accurately tuning your bow almost impossible.

, You may use any type of paper, but try to find a large sheet at least 24 inches (61 cm) on each side that is thin enough to tear with the force of a fletching going through it. Place this in a large picture frame with no back, or cut out your own frame from cardboard. Place the framed paper about 5 feet (1.5 m) in front of a safe target for your arrows, with the center of the paper at about shoulder height.Be prepared to use several sheets of paper in case your bow needs major adjustment.

, Shoot the arrow while standing approximately 5–10 ft (1.5–3 m) from the paper.You may wish to shoot two or three arrows, but only if you have the space to make a distinct hole in the paper for each one, near the paper's center.

, If the hole is a neat tear with three vane marks centered evenly, your bow is likely in decent shape already.If one of the vane marks is much thicker and sloppier than the others, make adjustments as described below.

, Always start by correcting vertical wobbling in the arrow, sometimes called porpoising. If the vertical tear on the paper is thick and long above the entry point, raise the nocking point slightly and shoot again. If the vertical tear is thick and long, but below the entry point, try lowering the nocking point instead. In most cases, finding the correct nocking height for your arrow will prevent it from wobbling vertically during flight. If you cannot solve the problem after several shots, consider the following adjustments:The fletching on your arrow may be striking the arrow rest as it leaves the bow. Mark the vanes of an arrow with athlete's foot powder or lipstick, as well as the arrow rest and any portion of your bow near the arrow. Shoot the arrow, then see where the material is rubbed off or marked. Adjust the arrow rest until the material is not smudged after shooting.On a compound bow, the wheel timing of your cams may be off. See the timing section.

, If the ""tail"" of the tear in the paper is much larger on the left or right, your arrow may be wobbling horizontally as it flies. This is typically caused by using an arrow that is too light or too stiff for your bow.Check the minimum arrow weight of your bow, or use an arrow selection chart to look up the correct ""arrow spine,"" or stiffness, for your bow. If you are using the correct arrows, try adjusting the arrow rest left or right, or altering the spring tension of your bow., Once you can shoot holes in your paper that are small and round, surrounded by small, even lines torn by the fletching, move back to about 40 ft (12 m) and try again. Because the arrows have a farther distance to fly, small problems will alter the arrow's flight more drastically. If the holes in the paper have any of the problems described above, make the same adjustments on a smaller scale to fine tune your bow. Once you are consistently getting well-shaped tears in the paper from this distance, your bow is well tuned.

Buy skates designed to enhance your performance.",How to Roller Skate," The only equipment you really need to roller skate is a pair of skates that fit you. You can buy a pair from a sporting goods store or rent a pair from any roller skating rink. Skate sizes are typically the same as standard shoe sizes. In addition to roller skates, you might want to pick up the following items:









A helmet. Since you're just starting out, wearing a helmet may help you feel more comfortable. Everyone takes a few spills at first, and wearing a helmet will protect your head from injury.
Knee pads and wrist guards. Your hands and knees are bound to hit the floor a few times as you learn how to roller skate. If you're concerned about getting a bit scraped up, protect yourself with knee pads and wrist guards.;
, Place your feet shoulder width apart, bend your knees, and squat. Lower your backside toward the ground and lean slightly forward in a comfortable squatting position. When you're roller skating, balance is key, and this stance will prevent you from toppling over.









The first time you hit the rink, you may feel like you don't have control over the skates, and you may lose your balance and fall a couple of times before you feel comfortable standing in place. This is completely normal; just keep practicing the posture until you get the hang of it.
It's hard to stand perfectly still in a pair of roller skates. Once you've got the hang of it down, practice correcting your posture every so often by slightly moving your skates to help you keep your balance. Think about it this way: if you were standing in place without roller skates on and someone gave you a light push, you'd move your feet to regain your balance. The same idea applies when you're wearing roller skates, only it's the wheels on the skates and the pressure from your own muscles that are giving you the ""push.""

, With your heels together and your toes pointed out, begin slowly walking forward, first the right, then to the left, then to the right, and so on.Continue squatting and keep your heels directly underneath your body so you can more easily keep your balance.









Practice until you can comfortably ""walk"" in the skates while keeping your balance. You'll probably fall down a few times at first; just get back up and remember to keep your body centered over your heels and remain in a squatting position.
As you gain confidence, start moving more quickly and taking longer strides. Push harder on the wheels so that you roll further with each stride.

, Push off with one foot and glide with the other until you lose momentum, then switch your gliding foot. While you're gliding on one foot, keep the other one above the floor so that it doesn't impede your gliding.









Practice turning right and left while gliding. When you turn right, lean your body slightly to the right. When you turn left, lean your body slightly to the left, always remaining in a squatting position.
Glide faster. Move your legs faster and gain momentum by putting pressure on the wheels and propelling yourself forward. Practice using your body weight to help you gain speed by leaning into your strides. Use your arms to help you keep your balance and gain speed by bending them at the elbows and moving them back and forth the way you would if you were running.

, Your right roller skate should be equipped with a brake, located on the toe of the skate. To stop, glide with your skates parallel to each other. Stay in a squatting position and lean slightly forward. Place the right skate slightly in front of the left skate, lift the toe of the right skate, and press down hard on the toe. The harder you press, the faster you'll stop.








It's important to stop with a confident thrust, rather than hesitantly touching your brake to the ground. If you don't press down hard enough on the brake, you may lose your balance and fall down.
If you find it difficult to apply enough pressure at first, try using your hands to press down on your right knee to help you exert enough force to stop.

, When you skate forward, you propel yourself by placing your feet in a ""v"" shape and applying pressure to your heels. To skate backward, then, place your feet in an inverted ""v"" shape, this time keeping your toes together and your heels apart. Remain in a squatting position and apply pressure to your right toe with the other foot lifted, then drop your left foot and apply pressure to your left toe with the right foot lifted.









Since you can't see behind you and you're forced to turn around and look from time to time, it may be more difficult to keep your balance while you're skating backward. Start slowly and figure out how to turn your body to look behind you without falling down. Avoid leaning backward, as this is a common reason people fall.
It takes practice, but eventually you'll be able to glide backward. Lengthen the strokes you take with your skates and practice rolling for awhile on one before you put the other skate down. Keep exerting pressure on your toes and making an inverted ""v"" shape with your feet.

, In this trick, you align the skates and skate on the heel of one foot and the toe of the other. Do a few glides to gain momentum, then lift the toe of your stronger skating foot so that you're skating only on the heel, with the other foot trailing directly behind. Lift the heel of your trailing skate so that you are skating on only the heel of one skate and the toe of the other.








, Start by gliding to gain some momentum. When you're ready to turn, do so by crossing on skate over the other and using it to push off in the new direction. For instance, if you're turning left, cross your right skate over your left skate, turn your body toward the left, and push off with your right skate in the left direction. Turn your shoulders in the direction you want to go, and lean into the turn to help keep your balance. Make sure to keep your knees bent a little so that you're more stable.








, Do a few glides, then bring your skates together, crouch, and jump a short distance. As you gain confidence, practice jumping higher and further. You can also try a jump turn, a fancy way to change direction.








, The best way to get better at roller skating is to practice often. Find a roller skating rink in your area and go there at least once a week so that you'll be able to build on your skills each time you go. Practice gliding, stopping, skating backward, and skating as quickly as you can. Keep practicing until you're comfortable doing turns and coming to a stop while constantly keeping your balance.








, It's fun to roller skate on your own, but if you're up for a challenge, consider joining a league. Roller derby has become a popular sport, and most cities have a league you can sign up for. If your city doesn't have a league, consider getting a few friends together and creating your own.










Roller hockey is another popular league-oriented style of roller skating. For this sport you'll need a pair of inline skates.

Aggressive skating, like skateboarding, is based around doing a series of daring tricks. Make sure you have protective equipment if you try this sport.

, There are many different types of skates to choose from, and as you start getting better at roller skating, you may want to invest in a pair of skates that will suit your specific needs and help you reach the skill level you desire. Consider the following options:









Indoor roller skates. If you like to skate indoors at a rink, consider buying your own pair of skates so you don't have to rent a pair every time.
Outdoor roller skates. These skates have wheels designed to be durable enough to withstand tougher conditions. You can use them to skate over asphalt and other road materials.
Speed skates. These skates are designed to go faster than typical roller skates, so consider them if you love to fly around the rink or down the street. You can by inline speed skates, which have a row of wheels, or quads, which have two wheels on either side.

Consult your owner's manual for timing marks.,
Test whether timing is an issue.,
Place the bow in a bow press.,
Adjust the control cable a half twist at the time.",How to Tune a Bow2," The cam is the wheel-shaped object where string and cables attach to the bow limbs. It manipulates the draw weight for more efficient energy storage, which is why compound bows can be so powerful.Some bows have two cams, one at each limb tip, while others have one cam and one idler wheel. Each cam should have a small hole or other mark along the edge to assist in finding the right timing, but the exact placement varies with manufacturer., Draw the bow fully back. Have a friend watch the cams as you do so. If your bow has two cams, did each one hit the ""draw stop"" at the same time, or are they not in sync with each other?In a single-cam bow, wheel timing is not as critical, but if the timing mark is not close to where the manual says it should be, make adjustments below.Never shoot your bow without an arrow, as the bow is only designed to release its energy through the arrow.

, If your bow's timing is off, you'll need a bow press in order to adjust the cables. Because using a bow press incorrectly can cause serious harm to yourself or the bow, it is recommended that you bring your bow to a professional for adjustment. Only use a bow press without expert supervision if you know it is suitable for your bow, and you are experienced with its use.

, The control cable is the cable the stops on the cam touch when the bow is fully drawn. Once the bow is safely in the bow press and the tension is relaxed, remove one end of this cable and give it a half twist (180º) before reattaching. Remove the bow from the press, then test the cam timing again. If the timing is still off, return the bow to the press and repeat this step until the timing is correct. Reverse the direction of the twist if the cam timing is worse than before.


The cam timing can change significantly with a small twist, so it's best to go one half twist at a time.

Determine your dominant eye.,
Use equipment that matches your dominant eye.,
Obtain the appropriate gear.,
Assume the correct shooting stance.,
Nock the arrow.,
Use three fingers to lightly hold the arrow on the string.,
Raise and draw your bow.,
Aim.,
Release the arrow by relaxing the fingers of your string hand.,
Once the arrow has left for its target, move your draw hand back and finish the shoulder rotation.,
Shoot the full end of arrows.This is usually composed of six arrows.,
Score your arrows if you wish.",How to Shoot an Arrow," As you can probably guess, your dominant eye is more accurate in aiming and judging distances. With archery, eye dominance is more important than hand-dominance, because you should be able to determine your target of the arrow.;
, Most archery equipment is labeled as ""right-handed"" or ""left-handed"" (referring to which hand pulls back the bowstring) probably because for most people, their dominant eye is on the same side as their dominant hand. (Right eye dominance is more commonand so is right-handedness.) However if your dominant eye is the opposite of your dominant hand, you should consider obtaining equipment for your weak hand. This ensures that you are able to use your dominant eye to aim because your hand and arms are capable of being left or right handed, or both, it depends on the usage of either or. unlike your eyes..



Right eye dominant: Use a right handed bow, hold the bow with your left hand, and pull the bowstring back with your right hand.
Left eye dominant: Use a left handed bow, hold the bow with your right hand, and pull the bowstring back with your left hand.

, Certain pieces of equipment are essential for ensuring both a safe and more enjoyable experience when practicing archery. The following items are recommended:



Wear an arm-guard (also known as a ""vambrace"" or bracer) on your bow arm (the side that holds the bow) to avoid it getting slapped by the bowstring (if you don't use one you will end up skinning your forearm if you do it too much).
You may also wish to wear a chest protector, especially if ;you are a woman, to protect your chest from string burn, as well as keep clothing from getting in the way. This is usually made from flexible plastic.
Get a finger tab for the string hand. This is a small piece of leather or heavy fabric that protects your drawing fingers when you let go of the bowstring.
A bowling can be worn to help your hand stay on the grip, and also to hold your open hand against the grip, which allows the bow to move freely during release.A quiver is worn on the back or around your waist, and is where the arrows are held.

, Your body should be perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, meaning that if you drew an imaginary line from you to the target, this line would go across the middle of your feet. If you are right eye dominant, hold the bow with your left hand, point your left shoulder to the target, and handle the arrow and string with your right hand. If you are left eye dominant, it's the reverse.



Place your feet shoulder-width apart so that your two feet form a straight line pointing towards the target.
In terms of posture, stand upright without tension. It should be a comfortable, yet firm stance. In proper form, the archer stands erect, forming a ""T"". The archer's back muscles are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point.
Pinch your buttocks together to bring your pelvis forwards.

, Point the bow towards the ground and place the shaft of the arrow on the arrow rest. Attach the back of the arrow to the bow string with the nock––the small plastic component with a groove for this purpose. If the arrow has three vanes, or fletching feathers, orient the arrow so that a single vane is pointing away from the bow. Place the arrow below the nock bead or in between if there are two nock locators. If you've never done this before, it's a very good idea to have someone who knows how show you what to do.


, Most commonly, the index finger is held above the arrow and the middle and ring fingers below. This is called the Mediterranean draw or ""split finger"" style and is currently the most popular position.In the Eastern tradition of holding the bowstring, the bow is held with the thumb and this is often done using a ring of metal or bone to protect the thumb.Another type of grip used it to place all three fingers below the arrow, which will draw the arrow closer to the eye. This is the advised position when shooting without a sight.


, This is often done in one fluid motion and with repeated practice, will involve perfect control of your movements, allowing you to concentrate fully on the target and not be distracted, not even by tiredness. Whenever holding the bow, it should be held in as relaxed a way as possible, without torque on the riser of the bow.1. Hold the bow arm outwards toward the target. Your inner elbow should be parallel to the ground and the bow should always stay vertical. You should be able to look straight down the spine of the arrow
2. Draw the string hand towards the face to an ""anchor point"". The anchor is usually somewhere around the chin, cheek, ear or the corner of the mouth. Since this is your reference point, it must remain consistent from shot to shot. Take care not to relax too much or to keep pulling back once you reach the anchor point, or you risk ill-targeted shots or losing power.
A good anchor point would be a bone that does not move. Flesh moves. Try the notch at the bottom of your jaw or your cheekbone, depending on how far you can bring the string back.

, Choose either instinctive shooting or shooting with a sight.



Instinctive shooting is the coordination between the eyes and the bow arm, allowing your experience and subconscious to guide your movement. It requires large amounts of concentration and practice. Focus on nothing but the center of the target.
Shooting with a sight involves adjusting pins on the side of a compound bow or some target recurves, setting for different distances.This way is much easier to learn, therefore is best for a beginner lacking experience.

, While this may sound simple, the manner in which you release your fingers from the bowstring can impact the arrow's flight. The aim is to get as clean a release as possible and as a beginner, this will probably take time. Problems that you may encounter when releasing the bow include flinching, wobbling or anticipating the shot inaccurately. Anything that deflects the string from the way you remove your fingers can alter the arrow's course.


, Keep the bow hand steady until the arrow hits its target. Watch your arrow as it flies.



Moving your hand forward to ""boost"" the arrow while you shoot is not a good thing. Resist the urge to help the arrow along (movements actually hinder your performance) and keep still.

, Repetition is learning––with practice, you'll improve over time. Part of learning to shoot an arrow effectively is learning the sequence outlined above so well that it simply flows and you do not get distracted by having to remember each distinct movement. Expect it to be difficult initially but it will become more fluid and comfortable the more that you go through the steps again and again.


, There are ten evenly-spaced rings on a standard FITA (International Archery Federation) target. The two inner yellow circles are equal to 10. Then the value decreases by one as you move outwards. If the arrow is just touching or on the line it is awarded the higher score.Naturally, the aim is to shoot arrows as closely as possible to the target's center.



Different disciplines (field archery, animal archery, Beursault archery, etc.) are recognized by the FITA with respect to distance, number of arrows, target type and equipment; these variations need to be taken into account when scoring.There may also be time limits, as with the Olympics.

Decide between a longbow and a recurve bow.,
Determine your ideal draw length.,
Decide on a budget for your traditional bow.,
Choose between endless loop and Flemish-style bowstrings.",How to Buy a Traditional Bow," The longbow represents one of the earliest and most time-tested bow designs; it is constructed from a single stick and a string. The limbs of the longbow curve gently back towards the archer's body, and the shaft is very long. A recurve bow has limbs that curve away from the archer's body towards the tips, with the string contacting the limbs over several inches (several cm).


Longbows tend to be easier for beginners to shoot than recurve bows. Their incredibly simple design means that they are nearly maintenance free and often very inexpensive. A significant drawback to longbows is their enormous length, which makes them difficult to transport and to maneuver through a wooded area.
Recurve bows are more popular than longbows for hunting applications. The design of the recurve bow allows for greater speed using the same amount of force. In addition, recurve bows are often smaller and can sometimes be disassembled for transport.;
, Draw length is the distance between the bow's handle and the string when fully pulled back, and it is crucial in determining to what length to cut your arrows down. Longbows and recurve bows can usually be drawn to a wide range of lengths and still function well, so determining your draw length is primarily helpful for cutting arrows.


To measure your draw length, stand up and span your arms out on either side of you. Face your palms towards the front, and have someone measure the distance between the tips of your middle fingers. Dividing this number by 2.5 will yield your ideal draw length.
If in doubt about your draw length, have your arrows cut slightly longer rather than shorter. An arrow can be a bit longer than necessary and still work well, while an arrow that is too short will force you into a shorter draw and generally poor form.

, In general, traditional bows are cheaper than compound bows because of their simpler design. However, prices can vary considerably with quality of materials.


One area in which the price will vary is aesthetics. Bows made from exotic African hardwoods will be pricier than those made from walnut or another common wood, for example. However, the difference in appearance can be dramatic.
Bows made from quality materials generally perform better as well. Quality construction tends to mean a smoother draw and faster shooting. Reduction in hand shock and the bow's overall longevity are also important benefits of more expensive, higher quality materials.

, When buying a traditional bow, you'll have 2 choices when choosing a bowstring: the endless loop style or the Flemish style. Either of these styles of string can be constructed from any material, perhaps the most popular for traditional bows being Dacron.


The endless loop style consists of a continuous loop of string that is bound together at both of the limb tips and at the center of the string for drawing. This style of string is very strong. Endless loop strings are ideal for recurve bows, because the bow design can more easily cope with the force of the string.
Flemish bowstrings consist of a single length of braided string. One end is looped, but the other end is left free; because of this, you can change the length of the bowstring by knotting the free end in a different location. Flemish bowstrings tend to reduce user fatigue, and are therefore ideal for counteracting the high shock associated with longbows.

Locate the limb bolts.,
Loosen the limb locking screws.,
Tighten or loosen the limb bolts to the desired weight.,
Test the bow’s pull.,
Settle on a draw weight that matches your upper body strength.,
Take your draw length into account.,
Consider how you’ll be using the bow.,
Choose a weight that’s comfortable.,
Use an average draw weight for reference.,
Draw and hold the bow for several seconds.,
Draw the bow with your feet off the ground.,
Identify where the draw feels heaviest.",How to Adjust a Bow," Look for the limb bolts near the center of your compound bow. The limb bolts lie in large circular knobs that attach the bow’s arms to the riser. These bolts must be manipulated to tweak the draw weight, or the amount of tension that is placed on the bow string as it is pulled.The riser is the central part of the bow that connects to the limbs and other mechanical components.;
, Certain compound bow models use a second set of bolts or screws to hold the limb bolts in place once they’re in the right position. These can usually be found on either side of the limb bolts. They can sometimes be undone with the same Allen wrench you’ll use to adjust the limb bolts, or they may require a separate screwdriver. Loosen the locking screws to allow the limb bolts to be adjusted., Insert the short arm of an Allen wrench (most commonly a 3/16 size, usually included with the bow) into the bolt and make sure it is properly slotted. Then, turn the wrench either clockwise to tighten the bolt or counterclockwise to loosen it. Adjust the tension of each arm of the bow to the preferred weight. Do this for both limb bolts, turning each bolt the same amount.Tighten or loosen the limb bolts one full rotation at a time. This will help you keep track of the level of tension in each of the limbs.On most compound bows, one rotation of the limb bolt translates to roughly a pound and a half of weight.
Remember to adjust the tension equally on both limbs.

, Secure the limb locking screws if your bow has them. Hold the bow as you ordinarily would and pull back the bowstring to test the draw weight. If you’re satisfied with how it feels, you’re done. If not, continue tinkering with the draw weight until you get it how you want it.You should be able to draw the bow in one smooth, controlled motion.

, The draw weight of the bow should be determined by your level of upper body strength. If the draw feels too heavy, or it becomes difficult to continue drawing the bow after multiple shots, the tension may be too high. An excessively heavy draw weight can wear you out and throw off your shot.Light draw weights are more manageable, but sacrifice force and velocity when propelling the arrow.A heavier draw weight doesn’t always equal a better shot. The force and trajectory can depend just as much on the type of arrow you’re using.

, Draw length refers to the distance it takes to pull the bowstring all the way back. The longer the draw length, the more tension that is placed on the bow and the heavier the weight of the bowstring. Make sure your bow is properly calibrated to suit your body type and measurements. If need be, take the bow to a specialist to have it modified.The draw length of the bow should correspond directly to your arm span.
Altering the bow’s draw length is more complicated, and may have to be done by a professional.

, Are you taking your bow hunting, using it for a sport competition or just practicing recreationally? Hunters may favor a heavier pull to ensure that their arrows have penetrating power. Competition archers, on the other hand, should aim to use a weight that lets them shoot over and over again without causing fatigue.Competition archers shoot more frequently and might get tired using a heavier draw weight.
Bows with different specifications and mechanical advantages are made for different kinds of sportsmen.

, Above all, the draw weight you decide on should feel natural in your hands. Don’t let your ego tempt you into using too heavy a bow or specifications that don’t fit your individual style. Adjust your bow until it is balanced enough to draw, hold and release without difficulty.Always go with what feels best. It may take a little time to figure out, but in the end your bow will be better calibrated to your unique proportions, and you’ll be more accurate as a result.

, If you’re just getting started and aren’t sure what draw weight would be best for you, take a look at some average draw weights as they’re categorized by age and sex. Children generally start with a weight of around 20-30lbs; women weighing less than 170lbs and older boys fall around 30-40lbs; women weighing over about 170lbs, older boys, and men weighing 150lbs or less might use a weight anywhere between 45-65 lbs; men between 150-200lbs use an average of 60-70lbs; men over 200lbs might use up to a 100 pound draw weight.Try out different bow sizes and draw weights to see which you handle best.
These are just average figures, and don’t reflect the abilities of an individual archer.

, Draw back the bowstring just short of full extension and hold it for about ten seconds. If you begin straining or fail to keep the bow drawn, decrease the tension a little by loosening the limb bolts one rotation at a time. You should be able to hold the bowstring taut in the position just before the wall for a few moments without a struggle.The point at which the bowstring can’t be pulled back any further is known as the “wall.” The wall of a draw is calculated to help you find the perfect amount of tension to take a shot.Drawing and holding is a practical exercise, as you’ll be holding the draw to aim when shooting for real.

, Some archers use this method to test how comfortable they are with their bow’s draw weight. Sit in a chair and raise the bow in front of you as if you were sighting a target. Now, pick your feet up off the ground and hold them up as you pull back the bowstring. Observe how easy or difficult this feels. Keeping your feet off the floor reduces your stability and shows you more clearly how much you’re relying on the muscles of your shoulders and back to draw.This test slightly overestimates the role of the upper body in drawing, holding and shooting, giving you more control when your feet are on the ground.

, As you pull back the bowstring, make a note of at what point you encounter the most resistance. The bow will normally have the highest amount of tension right before you reach the wall. If it starts getting hard in the middle of the draw or sooner, the limb bolts may need to be loosed just slightly. Similarly, if the draw feels too fast or easy, tightening the limb bolts will result in a more forceful release.Your draw should be one fluid movement, and the bowstring should not slow down at any point during the pull.

Think of it this way: it's tough to reproduce a precise level of tension each time, but a fully relaxed muscle is always in the same position.Encourage this consistency by warming up before each archery session, stretching your shoulders, upper back, neck, or anything else that feels tense.


Check your muscles again before releasing an arrow. Relaxing your forearm is one of the most important steps for consistent, accurate shooting. Tense your tricep instead.;
, Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, at a 90º angle to the target. Step a couple inches (few centimeters) forward with your lead foot and turn it outward.Balance your weight evenly between your two feet, without leaning in any direction.


If you catch yourself leaning or having balance issues, adjust your stance to be a little more open (facing the target).

, When holding the bow handle, most of the pressure should rest on the lower part of your thumb, about an inch (2.5cm) below the joint. Rotate your hand slightly so your palm and fingers are relaxed, not pushing against the bow. This natural hand position is easy to maintain and prevents you from twisting the bow with your palm as you shoot.Some archers use other holds, but these tend to be less forgiving. If your wrist is not in a natural position, you will need to exert strength to keep it in that position during shooting.

, Nock the arrow onto your bowstring and draw it back, keeping your wrist straight and relaxed. As you bring the string to your face, look for ""anchor points"" where parts of the bow meet your face. The more natural your anchor points feel, and the easier it is to locate them, the more consistent your shooting will be. Pick two or three of the following to use as anchor points, or invent your own that work well for you:Point where your hand touches your face. This is a specific point on your jaw, cheek, neck, or under your ear, depending on draw length and release type.
Point where the string lightly touches your nose (only if convenient).
Point where a ""kisser button"" on your string touches your mouth. (Some archers do not recommend a kisser button if you are using a peep sight.)

, Most compound bows are set up with a peep sight attached to the string. This is simply a ring you look through to help you aim. The sight should be attached somewhere you can easily look through it with your bow drawn to your anchor points.


If you don't have a peep sight, buy one online or at an archery store. A small peep sight lets you focus on targets across a wider range of distances, but make sure it is large enough to view your entire forward sight.Large sights are more useful in low-light conditions., The forward sight is attached to the front of your bow. Align the bow so the forward sight and target are visible through the peep sight.


The longer the distance between the peep sight and forward sight, the more accurate your aim will be. Target archers sometimes extend their forward sight several inches in front of the bow., Archers often close one eye, so it is easier to focus through the sight. This is usually a good tactic for beginners, and plenty of experienced archers do it as well. There are advantages to leaving both eyes open, however. Two eyes provide depth perception and a more complete view of the target. They are also better at tracking the arrow in flight, so you can see whether it flew too high, too wobbly, or so on.If you shoot with both eyes open, it helps to use a bow built for your dominant eye (for instance, a bow drawn with the right hand for a right-eye dominant person). If you use the other type of bow, you'll need to learn to make side-to-side aiming compensations when shooting with both eyes open. You can determine your dominant eye with simple home tests.

, A typical compound bow's forward sight has several pins lined up inside. These usually mark 20 yards (the topmost pin), 30 yards, 40 yards, and 50 yards.Choose the pin that best matches your distance to the target, and move your bow so that pin is directly in front of the target.


If you're not sure which distance the pins represent, find out by trial and error. Measure 20 yards to a target and sight through each pin until you discover one that lets you hit consistently.
Some bows use one or more adjustable ""slider"" pins. In order to set them to different distances quickly, use software that prints out a custom ""sight tape"" for your bow., Most forward sights also have a bubble level. If the bubble is not in the center of the level, tilt the bow left or right until it is.

, Many beginners shoot as soon as the pin lines up with the target. Surprisingly, you can get more consistent results by letting the pin ""float"" off target before you shoot. Focusing on getting your pin 100% perfect can lead to tension or bad form. Let the pin drift small distances back and forth or around your target instead, and release when you are relaxed., The peep sight and pins are a great way to turn aiming into a precise, focused task. Some archers, however, prefer to focus on the target instead. By focusing farther away, minor movements do not make as big a difference in their sight. Some archers also find this tactic reduces anxiety.Ideally, you can still use the blurry sight as a rough guide as it ""floats"" across your target, but it takes practice to get this to a subconscious level.

Make fletchings (optional).",How to Make a Bow and Arrow," There are a few things to consider when selecting raw wood for your bow:


Find a piece of dry and dead (but not gray or cracking) hardwood (such as oak, lemon tree, hickory, yew, black locust, or teak) about 1.8 meters (about 6 feet) in length. The wood should be free of knots, twists or limbs, and it would be helpful if the branch is thick at its center.
This piece of wood should be somewhat flexible, such as juniper or mulberry. You can even use a shaft of bamboo or cane but take care that it is not too thick. For that you can use young bamboo which is strong as well as flexible.
Green wood (living wood that you cut from a tree or sapling) can be used if absolutely necessary, but should be avoided because it does not provide the same power as dry wood.;
, Every piece of wood will have a natural curve, no matter how slight. As you construct the bow, this curve will determine where you place its main features. To find the curve, place your wood on the ground, with one hand holding it in place at the top. With your other hand, press lightly against its middle. It will swivel so that its natural belly faces you, and its back faces out.

, These parts are essential to the shaping process. To find the handhold, make marks three inches above and below the center point of the bow. Anything within these marks is the handhold, above them is the upper limb, and below is the lower limb.

, Place the bottom end of the bow on your foot, and one hand atop the bow. With your other hand, press outward, the belly facing you. Use this exercise to catalog where the bow is flexible and where it is not. Using a knife or similar tool, shave wood off the unyielding spots on the belly only, until both the upper and lower limbs curve similarly to each other. Check your progress frequently. When both limbs are more flexible and are mirror images of each other in curve and diameter, you are ready for the next step.


You want the bow to be strongest (thickest) at the handhold.
Be careful to only carve from the belly. An inordinate amount of pressure is exerted on the back of the bow, and even the slightest damage to its structure can promote breakage.

, Use your knife to cut notches that begin at the sides and curve around toward the belly of the bow and in toward the handhold as they go. There should be one on each side about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from each end of the bow. Remember not to cut into its back, and do not make the notches deep enough to compromise the strength of the tips. Make them just deep enough to hold the string in place.

, The string should not be stretchy, as the power comes from the wood, not the string. If you are stranded in the wilderness, it may be difficult to find a suitable string, and you may need to try a variety of materials before you find one that has the necessary strength. Some bowstring material possibilities are:


rawhide
thin nylon rope
hemp cord
fishing line
strands of cotton or silk from caterpillars
ordinary twine

, You will need to tie a loose loop with a very secure knot at both ends of your bowstring before slipping it over the lower, and then upper, limb of your bow. Make your string slightly shorter than the length of your unflexed bow, so that both bow and string are taut.

, Hang it upside down by the handhold from a tree branch or something similar so that you can pull downward on the string. Pull downward slowly, checking to make sure that the limbs bend evenly and carving away wood as required, until you can pull it as far down as the distance between your hand and your jaw (arm fully extended out from shoulder)., The wood should be dry and dead. Each arrow should be about half as long as the bow, or as long as the bow can draw back. It does not work to have arrows that can't be pulled back to the bow's potential. Consider these items as well:


Green wood does work if you can give it some extra time to dry out naturally, as the sap may ignite if placed over a fire to dry.
Some strong, straight plants for arrows are goldenrod and Mullen . They can be found in fields.

, You will need to whittle the wood smooth around the circumference of the arrow. You can straighten an arrow by gently heating the shaft over hot coals--do not scorch or burn the wood--and then holding the arrow straight while the wood cools. Carve a small notch in the back tip of each arrow to accommodate the bow string. This is called a nock.

, The simplest arrowhead is simply a carved point on the front of the arrow shaft. You can whittle such a point with a knife and then fire harden it by gently heating it in coals (again, be careful not to burn or scorch the wood).

, (This is optional). You can do this with metal, stone, glass, or bone. Carefully use a small rock or hammer to chip your material into a point and attach it to the arrow's tip. You can do this by notching the wood, inserting the arrowhead into the notch, and then lashing the arrowhead to the wood with some sort of string or cord.

, While fletchings improve the arrow's flight, they are not necessary for a field-expedient weapon. Find some feathers to make the fletchings and glue them (if possible) onto the back ends of the arrows. You could also split back of the arrow, slide the feather in, and tightly wrap a thin thread (possibly obtained from your own clothes) around the fletching. If you use this method, you can use just about anything as your fletching.


Fletchings act similarly to rudders on a ship or small plane, guiding the arrow through the air for pinpoint accuracy.
They also have a similar effect to a glider, as they vastly improve an arrow's range of flight.
They are, however, somewhat difficult to perfect. If your weapon is meant for survival, this is not a priority.

,,, Turn the bow to the side and notch the arrow. Once a bow has been given to you, place an appropriate size arrow on the string before placing your index finger above the arrow, and the middle and ring finger beneath, only holding on with the distal phalanx, leaving the small finger away.


Arrows must be as long as your arm, reaching down to about an inch (2.5cm) past your thumb.
Be sure to put the arrow on the arrow rest if your bow is equipped with one.

, This may affect where your arrow goes.

, Draw back so that the tip of the string is on the tip of your nose and your hand under your jawbone.


You can draw back the arrow to whatever spot on your face you feel most comfortable with. Preferably, your chin, cheek, or jawbone notch.

,, You should be able to look down the shaft of the arrow, but always be looking at where you want your arrow to go.


If the arrow is not in the center, then adjust the sight, following the arrow. For example, the arrow is too far right so move your sight to the right.

, When the red spot is on the middle, release, sliding your fingers away.

, Watch the arrow wend its way to target and hope that you hit it.

, If you persevere, perhaps one day you will be an Olympic champion (or at least be pretty good)!

Make sure your thumb is the first finger out of the ball.,
Rotate your hand just slightly from the wrist at the moment of release.,
Follow through with the swing.,
Adjust based on results.",How to Spin a Bowling Ball," The holes must fit your fingers in such a way that you can hold the ball without having to squeeze and you can let go without your fingers getting stuck. Because you will be imparting rotation on the ball in the final split seconds that your hand is in contact with it, the importance of grip cannot be overstated.


With the ball resting in the palm of your dominant hand, put your middle and ring finger all the way into the two holes that are side-by-side, and your thumb in the hole under them. The holes should be the size of the fingers and thumb, and you should be able to hold the ball easily in the palm of your hand. There shouldn't be tension in the web of your thumb, nor should it be slack.It should take very little pressure to hold the ball in your hand. If you could break an egg with that amount of pressure, it's too much.;
, The characteristics of the core or interior weight block of the bowling ball play an important part in the ball's performance. While there are a number of different core alignments, there are two basic categories into which all balls fit. Determine which type you are using before you get started.Look over your bowling ball and see if it has just one ""pin""--the spot on the exterior, usually of a different color, indicating the orientation of the core--or a single normal pin plus a second PSA indicator/mass bias pin.
If there is only one pin, the ball should have a symmetric weight block. If you bisected the ball along the axis of the pin, you would discover that both sides are symmetric. This type of ball may be easier for a beginner to handle.
A ball with an asymmetric weight block should possess two pins or a pin and an indicator. Just as the name indicates, these balls do not contain symmetric cores, and can contain any shape from that of a cube to something resembling the letter ""L."" It may prove slightly more difficult for a beginner to attain consistent performance with these bowling balls, but practice with a single ball can certainly change that.

, There are two separate guidelines used to suggest the size of ball that should be used. One rule of thumb focuses on the sex of the bowler, and suggests that adult women should use a 10-14 pound ball, while adult men use a 14-16 pound ball.The alternate guideline states that a bowler should use a ball roughly 10% of their body weight, up to the 16 pound maximum size of the ball for those over 160 pounds in weight.It is important to use a ball of the appropriate weight in order to impart the necessary amount of spin. A strong individual using a smallish ball could easily impart too much torque and put the ball in the gutter. A weaker individual using too heavy a ball could struggle to impart enough spin in order to make the ball hook.
The weight of the ball should be clearly marked on it.

, The pocket is the space between two pins that you want to target with the ball. If you're right-handed, the pocket is the space between the number 1 pin (the foremost pin) and the number 3 pin (the pin just behind and to the right of number 1). If you're left-handed, your pocket is between the number 1 and number 2 pin (the pin just behind and to the left of number 1).

, The style of grip that you use can determine the intensity of the ball's hook--in other words, at what angle the ball enters the pocket. Remember that the greater the angle, the better your scoring potential.


A ""relaxed"" grip is more likely to produce a straighter roll, and thus a minimal hook. In this grip, the hand is flexed back at the wrist, so that as you pass into the forward swing it is on top of the ball.
For a ""strong"" grip, the hand bends forward, as if to cradle the ball between your palm and inner wrist. If seen from the side, the angle from your forearm to your thumb should appear to be 90 degrees. This grip can provide a greater amount of spin, and from that a greater hook.
A ""firm"" grip is an intermediate form that results in a moderate hook. In this grip the wrist neither bends nor flexes, creating a continuous line from your forearm through your hand., As you face the lane, imagine its boards grouped into three sections: outside left (towards the left gutter), middle, and outside right (towards the right gutter). Keeping in mind the strength of your grip and the anticipated amount of hook it will produce, decide which board(s) your sliding forward foot should align with.


Relaxed grip: The ball should travel straight down the lane into the pocket, so if you're right-handed, your stance should be in the outside right, and lefties in the outside left.
Firm grip: Your stance should be in the middle, so the ball curves moderately (either left or right) and enters your target pocket.
Strong grip: You want to allow plenty of room for the ball's hook to curve around and enter the pocket. If you're right-handed, you should be on the outside left side; if you're left-handed, you should be on the outside right., One of the standard forms is referred to as the ""Four Step Approach."" For this approach, begin standing up straight with your feet directly under your body. Hold the ball from underneath with your bowling hand at about mid-chest height (higher for slower bowlers, lower for faster bowlers), and support the ball with your non-bowling hand. As you move through the four steps, keep your bowling arm's elbow as close to your hip as possible, bend your knees slightly, and keep your feet pointed towards the pins. Your shoulders should be squarely facing front. (The following directions are for right-handed bowlers; if you are left-handed, reverse the sides.)


Take one step forward with your right foot and simultaneously bring the ball forward to a position over that foot. Keep your non-bowling hand supporting the ball at this point.
Move your left foot forward as you lower the ball close to a knee-level position and then further back behind you, making a half-circle. Your non-bowling hand will have released the ball at this point.
Take another step forward with your right leg. At the same time you should be entering the highest point of your backswing with the ball.
Bring the ball forward as you take your last step toward the line with your left leg. Your right leg should subtly pass sideways behind your left as you plant your left leg and release the ball. Lower your hips and shift your weight slightly back, bending your torso forward at a 15-degree angle., You will not impart spin by bending or twisting your wrist or arm at this point.Instead, it is through proper delivery and release of the ball that you will impart the spin that results in a ""hook.""

, Maintain a constant grip as your hand moves into the forward swing, passing the heel of your sliding shoe (the left foot for right-handed bowlers), and then release the ball as it passes the laces. This is the optimum point for momentum to carry the ball onto the lane., The spin comes from your fingers as they release the ball, rather than the wrist. Releasing the thumb first lets the ball roll off the hand, which is where it gets the torque it needs for spin., A small, 15-degree rotation (counterclockwise for right-handed bowlers and clockwise for left-handed) helps add spin.Imagine positioning your hand as if coming into a handshake.

, Continue to move your arm upward and forward toward the pocket as you release the ball (and after).

, You must first work on consistency. The ability to put all the elements together and repeat them are the keys to success. In the process, think about things like your stance position or the type of grip that you employ.


Also work on your timing with the Four Step Approach: you want to make sure that your foot and the ball arrive at the foul line at the same time. Try recording yourself bowling to get a better sense of how good your timing is.

Learn the basics of how the game is structured.,
Understand the format of a bowling score card.,
Know the extras.",How to Score Bowling1," A game of bowling has 10 frames. Within each frame, each player has 2 opportunities to knock down all 10 pins.If all 10 pins are knocked down by a player on the first roll of a frame, the player is awarded a strike and won't need a second turn in that frame.
If a player uses 2 balls to knock down all 10 pins in a frame, the player is awarded a spare. For example, the player may knock down 7 pins on the first roll and 3 pins on the second.
If a player misses all 10 pins on the first roll and then knocks all 10 down on the second, it's still considered a spare (not a strike) because it took 2 balls to knock the pins down.
An open frame is when a player doesn't knock all 10 pins down in both attempts.;
, The score card has a place for each bowler's name, followed by 10 boxes (one for each frame) and a final score box. Each of the 10 boxes has a set of 2 smaller boxes; these are to record the number of pins knocked down for each roll within the frame.


The final score box has 1 smaller box, which designates the third roll in frame 10 -- used only if the bowler gets either a spare or strike in the tenth frame.

, Depending on the rules you and your friends have determined, you may need to determine how to mark variations in game play. Once in a while, things out of the norm happen -- how will these be marked?


An ""F"" can denote when a bowler has gone over the line (literally) -- the line separating the walk-up to the actual lane. If they do, they receive 0 points for that turn.
If a bowler receives a split, you may mark an ""O"" around the number to indicate the pin set-up. As an alternative, mark an ""S"" in front of the number of pins knocked down. A ""split"" happens when the headpin has been successfully knocked down, yet there is still a gap between all the others still standing.
If the headpin was missed, sometimes the terms ""wide"" or ""washout"" are used. A ""W"" can be denoted on the card, but, in general, this annotation has fallen out of common usage."
"
Score an open frame.,
Record a spare.,
Score a strike.,
Record combinations.",How to Score Bowling2," Scoring an open frame on the score card is simply adding the number of pins the player knocked down on their first roll with the number of pins knocked down on the second roll. This is the total for the frame.


In bowling, a running total is kept. The current score of each player is added and placed in the box designated for each frame. For example, if a player knocks down 3 pins on their first roll and 2 pins on their second, a 5 is placed in the box for frame 1. If a player knocks down a total of 7 pins in the second frame, a 12 is placed in the box for frame 2.

, If a player spares, the number of pins the player knocked down on the first roll is listed in the first box, and a slash is placed in the second box.


A spare is worth 10 pins plus the number of pins the player knocks down on the next roll. For example, if a player gets a spare in the first frame and then knocks down 7 pins on the first roll of the second frame, list a 17 in frame 1.

, If a player gets a strike, record an X in the box for the first roll.


When scoring a strike, the strike is worth 10 pins plus the number of pins the player knocks down on the next 2 rolls. For example, if a player gets a strike in frame 1, then knocks down 5 pins on the first roll in frame 2 and 4 pins on the second roll, list a 19 in frame 1.
If the player bowls a strike and follows with another strike, the player still adds in the next roll. Therefore, if a player gets a strike in frames 1, 2 and 3, the total for the first frame would be 30.

, Sometimes it gets a little messy. Let's do some concept-checking: if you bowl a strike in the first frame, a split (7|/) in the second frame, and a 9 in the third, what's the final score?


Did you come up with 48? The first frame is 20 (the strike plus the spare is 10+10), the second frame is 39 (20+10+9), and the third frame is 48 (39+9).

Pick a comfortable weight.,
Find a ball that fits your fingers.,
Choose between a right-handed or left-handed bowling ball.",How to Pick a Bowling Ball1," Bowling balls come in a variety of weights, ranging from 6 pounds (2.7 kg) to 16 pounds (7.3 kg). Choose a ball that is heavy enough for you to effectively roll down the bowling lane without straining yourself.


Heavier is not necessarily better. Remember, you will be tossing the ball two dozen times and what seems like a comfortable weight at first might not be so comfortable by the end of the night.
For practice, try swinging a weight at home in much the same way that you would swing a bowling ball. If, after 23 times, your arm is tired, that weight level is too high for you. You want to have full use of arm strength through the duration of the game.As a general rule, you should be able to handle a bowling ball around 10% of your own body weight. Unfortunately, the poor grip quality of house balls at bowling alleys can make tossing these more strenuous. When working with a ball not specifically fitted to you, it might be necessary to use a lighter ball.;
, Each bowling ball has holes for your thumb, middle finger and ring finger. Pick a ball with holes that allow your fingers to be inserted and removed freely, without being so loose that you lose control of the ball. Find a ball for which the distance between the holes (span) is comfortable for you. Try out several balls until you have a fit that feels comfortable.For house balls, the size of the holes typically correlates with the weight on the ball. Heavier bowling balls feature larger holes, whereas lighter balls feature smaller holes. The limited range of options can make it difficult to find a ball that has the right weight and finger parameters for you, but you should keep on trying until you find the best fit.
When purchasing your own ball, the pro shop should customize the span and finger holes to the size of your hand. Any quality store should fit a ball precisely to your needs without much effort on your part.
A pro shop should also sell finger inserts, which can be useful when using other people’s balls. These can be transferred from one ball to another to improve your grip and give all of your balls a consistent feel. These have become very popular in recent years., The only difference between the two is that the ring finger is drilled 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) further from the thumb hole on a left-handed ball. The majority of balls available for rental at bowling alleys are right-handed balls. If you want to use a left-handed ball, you may need to specifically request one.

"

Choose between speed and hook.,
Pick a ball with the right core for your hook.,
Pick an appropriate ball for lane conditions.,
Select a color.",How to Pick a Bowling Ball2," If you have trouble getting the ball down the lane at high speeds, certain ball types can improve your speed, though it will be at the expense of your hook. As a rule, balls that are shinier produce less friction and thus can move faster. Balls that have a dull appearance produce more friction and thus are easier to hook.To hook a ball is to cause it to swing to the right or the left after tossing it. This creates the optimal trajectory for a strike, but it is a technique that typically only skilled bowlers can perform correctly
Urethane balls are good for players who want to increase speed, but retain some hook in their throw.
Resin, reactive, and particle balls are better for grip and hook than speed. These are good for experts who have built up a good ball speed and now want to master their hook.
Plastic balls are good for beginners because they tend to go straight without losing control. They are not optimal, however, for either speed or hook.At a pro shop, balls made of any substance can be polished to reduce friction, thus increasing speed and decreasing hook. 60-80% of a ball's performance depends upon its coverstock (the hard exterior). This is the most important customizable feature of the ball.

, Next to the cover, the most important feature of a bowling ball is its core. The heavier the core, the quicker the ball will begin to hook. A lighter core will cause the ball to hook further down the lane. There is no best core, just the core that fits throw.


Core design varies significantly from one ball to another, making it a complex issue. You should talk to an employee at the pro shop about the core design of any ball that you are interested in.The core is an area inside the ball that offsets the weight imbalance created by the finger holes. Because this is inside the ball, you can't actually see it and it can be difficult to understand what effect it has on your throw. That is why it is important to consult a professional about the core of your ball.

, Determine whether your bowling lane is dry or oily. This will help you decide whether to pick a polished or rough ball. An oily lane will cause more skidding and, if your ball has begun to skid out of control, you should switch to a ball that is less polished. Resin, reactive, and particle balls have the grip necessary for oiled lanes.There is no easy way to determine how the lane is oiled. You can ask the staff, but often your only real recourse is to toss the ball a few times and see how it skids.
Typically lanes will be oiled unevenly. Often they are oiled more around the center than the edges. This will help the ball retain control before sliding into the gutter. Sometimes, the lane is oiled more in the front than the back of the lane, causing the ball to skid earlier. Thus, whether you switch to a ball that produces more friction should also be determined by whether the position of the oil is throwing off your game.
Wipe down your ball before every throw if your lane is oily. Use a dry towel to wipe your ball.

, Bowling balls are available in a wide variety of colors. Some balls are available in multiple colors, swirl patterns or even glow-in-the dark designs. The color of a ball won't physically affect how the ball travels, but a ball that makes you proud can give you the confidence you need to play a better game."

Look no further than the alley.,
Imitate other bowlers.,
Find a good pro shop.",How to Pick a Bowling Ball3," The house balls at the bowling alley are not high performance balls. Specifically, it is very difficult to get a hooked throw using one of these. However, these balls can be good for beginners because they have a lot of control and are good for straight line throws. If you’re starting out and don’t want to spend a lot of money, these can be an excellent choice.


Even experts will occasionally throw the sort of polyester balls that are used as the house balls at bowling allies. Specifically, professional will use them for picking up spares, because when doing that an accurate, straight shot is typically preferable to a hook. Similarly, if you’re still struggling to keep the ball out of the gutter, these are probably the best balls for you., When you watch bowling, pay attention to what professionals are using. At the alley, talk to some of the better bowlers about their bowling ball choice. Be particularly mindful of the choices of a bowler who has a style similar to yours.The issue with this technique is that there isn’t one best ball on the market. Finding the right ball is about finding one that fits your physique and style. So, following someone else’s lead will only work if you have similar styles.
Alternatively, you can also ask bowlers what shop they got their ball at. This might be the most relevant piece of information, because the pro shop will be responsible for fitting your ball to your hands and should give you a lot of advice about what type fits your style. Ask around for a shop with knowledgeable staff, possibly even employees who were themselves professional bowlers.

, Ask other bowlers and look online for a bowling shop with highly knowledgeable staff. Many shops will employee staff members who were themselves either successful professional or semi-professional bowlers.Because bowling balls have become so technologically advanced over recent years, it is important to have expert advice. The pro shop will also customize your grip, which can be one of the most important elements for achieving a quality game.


As late as the 1980s, most bowling balls were fairly standardized. Today, bowling balls have different textures and core types, which have a substantial impact on play style. You should seek expert assistance when determining what type fits your style best."

Find a local bowling alley.,
Go to the bowling alley.,
Talk to someone that works there.,
Figure out what works best for your schedule or friends' schedules.,
Sign up and commit to a league.,
Bowl!",How to Join a Bowling League," Maybe you pass one on your way to work every morning. If you don’t, search the internet, or (if anyone does this anymore) use a phone book to find one. USBC (United States Bowling Congress) has a website that has a Find a Center search engine to help with this., Check out the place. See if you like the atmosphere. Is there a snack and beverage bar that you like in there? Is there a pro shop where you can ask questions to learn more about the game/sport?

, Ask what nights there are leagues on. If you’re competitive or more of a recreational bowler ask which nights those leagues are on. Be able to tell the employee what you typically average on the lanes (if you know), if you have your own ball/shoes, and what your expectations are of joining a league (i.e. a night out with friends, to win some money, to practice your technique and get better).

, Pick a night (or day, if that's preferable) that works best for your schedule or friends’ schedules. It’s always good to have friends sign up with you to add to the commitment but also so you have at least one person you know. Go into the league with the goal to meet new people that share your same interests. Bowling leagues are a great social, competitive atmosphere where you can get some exercise and have fun if your put yourself in the right frame of mind.

, When you pick a night and sign up, make sure you know what you’re committing to. Most leagues run 30 plus weeks from approximately August through April. Some are longer and some are shorter. When you sign up, don’t drop out unless you absolutely have to for an injury or family emergency. There’s nothing worse for the other bowlers to have someone leave the season early and have to bowl unopposed.

, Have fun, be competitive. Enjoy!

Wear bowling shoes at all times while in the bowler's area.,
Avoid eating or drinking while on the bowler's area.,
Avoid swearing or shouting.,
Stay off of the approach unless it is your turn.,
Make sure that you have permission to use another person's ball.",How to Practice Proper Bowling Etiquette1," If you wear street shoes, you risk ruining the approaches and/or the equipment.

When you are putting your bowling shoes on, be sure that you move them as far away from walkways as possible, to avoid anyone tripping on them.
If your street shoes are wet or dirty, be sure that you take them off as far away from the lanes as possible. If you track water, mud, or anything else onto the lanes, then you run the risk of you or someone else falling flat on their face.;
, Something as simple as a drop of water could easily create a big hazard. Eat or drink either at a seating area that is usually located behind the general bowling area, or simply just away from all of the lanes., Even if you were really upset about a missed strike, remember that especially if you are at an open bowling session, and there are families with children there, they can likely hear you and it may cause them to be uncomfortable., If it is not your turn, either go to the seating area behind you or step out of any bowlers' ways. This can be an annoyance, especially if they were in the middle of throwing their ball and you walked in front of them., If for whatever reason you need to use it, ask them politely, and make sure that you have a good reason. If they end up saying no, respect that and move on.

If you need to use another person's ball because your ball is stuck, then simply let the next bowler on your lane know. Their ball may hit it, or theirs may become stuck too. If their ball becomes stuck too, go up to a worker and tell them that you have a couple of bowling balls that are stuck. It may take awhile to get them back, but it may also avoid someone from becoming upset that their ball was used.

Stand close to what you're punching.,
Place your punching foot forward.,
Drop your non-punching foot behind you.,
Hold your hand close to your target.,
Make a fist.,
Pop forward and punch.,
Flick your wrist joint upward as you punch.,
Keep practicing on a soft pad.",How to One Inch Punch," The one-inch punch is thusly named because the punch is thrown from an inch - actually, three to six inches, if you count the width of your fist. To execute the punch, it's necessary to be quite close to the person or object you're punching. Gauge the distance by stretching out your arm toward your target; your elbow should be slightly bent at a bit less than a 45-degree angle.


If you can straighten your arm without touching it, you're too far away; you'll have to lunge forward to hit your target, which will take away from the force of your punch. Move a little closer.
If your elbow is bent at a right angle, or close to it, you need to step back a bit.
The term ""one-inch"" is actually an estimate here. The point is to punch from a very close distance, not from exactly one inch.
After practicing the punch a few times, you should be able to figure out the right distance from your target without having to extend your arm beforehand.;
, If you're going to punch with your right hand, your right foot should be pointed toward the space between your target's feet, and if you're going to punch with your left hand, put your left foot forward. Bend your knee comfortably and stand with your torso centered.









Don't point your toe to the left or right of your target; it should be pointed straight ahead.
Don't lean forward toward the target, as this will prevent you from being able to punch as hard.

, If you're going to punch with your right hand, your left foot should be slightly behind your center of gravity, and if you're going to punch with your left hand, your right foot should be placed slightly back. You'll use it to spring slightly forward when you throw your punch.









Be sure your torso is centered, rather than leaning forward or backward.

, It should be within an inch or two of your target - either a punching bag or a person's chest. Note that trying to punch below chest level is a lot more difficult. You'll get the best power if you punch in a line from your chest to someone else's.








, Hold your hand so that your fingers fold over your palm. They should be pointing toward your wrist. Grip your thumb over your forefinger. Your fist should be firm, but not too tight. If you're too stiff, you won't have the flexibility you need to punch with force.









If you're trying to take someone by surprise, you want to make a fist right at the last second. You can fake someone out by holding your non-punching hand in a fist and cocking it backward; they'll be watching that hand instead of the one that's about to go for the punch.

, Synchronize your arm and body movements so that your punch has as much power as possible.Throw your hips and weight into the punch. Even though your force is being exerted from a very short distance, you be sure to punch, not push, the target. When you connect with the target, your hand should spring backward, rather than continuing to travel forward in a pushing motion.








, This upward flick of the wrist is an essential part of the one-two punch movement, and it's what distinguishes this punch from the others. When you flick your wrist, your thumb should tilt up. Think of the motion you'd use to yank on a fishing pole when a fish has just bitten the line.









Make sure your wrist doesn't weave from right to left as you punch. You want to flick it up and straight toward your target.

, A way of checking how much power you are putting into the punch is to have a buddy hold something soft, such as a phone book, over his or her chest (not over the heart). A powerful punch will knock the person off balance.

Be ready to take your turn immediately.,
Wait until the pin setting machine has finished its entire cycle and the sweep bar is lifted completely before you bowl.,
Avoid stepping over the foul line.,
Avoid throwing your ball down the wrong lane.,
Step away from the approach immediately when your turn is finished.,
Recognize that the bowler on the right is given priority.",How to Practice Proper Bowling Etiquette2," Most likely, there are other bowlers on your lane who would like to bowl too. Therefore, when it is your turn, be sure you are walking up to the area immediately to avoid keeping everyone waiting.

If you need to use the bathroom, try and time it out so you have a minute before your turn, and go as quick as possible. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can also designate someone to bowl for you if you do not come back in time so that no one is kept waiting.

, While you should be ready to bowl immediately when it is your turn, wait until that short process is complete, because failing to do so could result in you damaging equipment or your ball, and it may also result in your ball getting stuck. , It is dangerous to do so, because it can result in you getting oil on the approach, which can be dangerous for anyone who is walking on it. , Although you will likely be told if you are about to throw your ball down the wrong lane, you may not be. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to which lane you are on at all times, because if you throw your ball down the wrong lane, the game will likely be delayed because the score will have to be changed., This will immediately open up the approach so that someone else can bowl right away, and it won't unnecessarily delay the game., If it is your turn, and you as well as the person to the right of you are ready to bowl at the same time, let them go first. Step off of the approach and wait patiently for them to finish."
"
First of all, it is imperative that you assess your situation.,
While you are talking to your prospective opponent, walk away from him.,
When you get outside, do not let your opponent get near you.,
Keep your body language passive, with your hands unclenched and your voice low and calm.,
If your opponent advances quickly towards you, a fight is imminent.,
THERE ARE NO RULES IN A STREET FIGHT.,
In the real world, fights do not look like they do in the movies.,
If you are not trained in martial arts or some sort of self-defense system, do not under any circumstances try to replicate what you may have seen on TV or the movies.,
Once you have incapacitated your attacker, get away.",How to Win in an Unarmed Combat Situation," Going into a fight blind will never end well. Assess why your adversary is picking a fight and if he is alone, intoxicated, or armed. If possible, defuse the situation by keeping calm and backing down. It is better to keep a fight verbal as opposed to physical under most circumstances.;
, Take the argument outside, which not only puts distance between you two, but will draw a crowd. You need witnesses to testify that you didn't start the confrontation or escalate it into violence. You will also lessen the probability of him having easy access to a weapon of opportunity (pool stick, bottle).

, Keep a halo of around 3 feet (0.9 m) around yourself, which will keep you out of striking distance. Move around, walk around, but do not allow yourself to be backed into a corner. Don't walk backwards, which can lead you to trip or fall, but instead walk sideways so you can see where you are going while still keeping your opponent in your sight.

, Shouting and clenching your fists is pretty much asking for a fight.

, As soon as he breaks your halo, strike and strike decisively. Do not give him the opportunity to hit you first. Landing the first blow gives you a semblance of control over the situation and will put your opponent off guard and on the defensive.

, If the opportunity presents itself, strike below the belt. A solid kick to the groin followed by a knee or fist to the face of your bent over opponent will end the fight. Do not worry about looking pretty or trying to box. The idea here is to incapacitate your opponent and to stop him from causing you harm, not to show off.

, Assume you will get hit. It will hurt. It will scare you and put your body into survival mode. The best thing you can do is take the punch somewhere where it will not take you out of the fight or cause you real harm. Take a punch to the top of your head, your arms, or your forearms. Get in close to lessen the force and the impact of the blow while giving yourself leverage to counter-attack.

, Attempting complex holds, chokes, or strikes without proper training will only leave you open should your opponent have a working knowledge of counters or reverses. Always assume that your opponent is trained to fight. Never underestimate him.

, The idea is to buy yourself time to get away from a potentially serious conflict, not to beat your opponent senseless. Once he is out of the fight, get away and stay away. If you are stopped either during the fight or immediately after by law enforcement, you have a much better case for self-defense if you only used the necessary force to secure your safety.

Learn your Stance Keep your hands up in front of your face at-least above your chin and keep your elbows in.,
Master Basic Punching Extend your arm and make sure the back of your hand is facing the sky.,
Understand the Basic Round Kick Most kicks come from your back leg.,
Learn the Clinch Hold The clinch hold is important if you want to take the fight to the ground, or prevent going to ground.,
Clinching 2 From the arms locked around waist position your opponent can knee you but even if they do you have a huge leverage advantage over them and can actually lift them up (if you have any strength at all and your opponent is within 25lbs) and drop them.,
Clinching3 Perhaps the most dangerous strike that has been used in NHB fighting is the elbow.",How to Understand the Basics of Standup Fighting,"


Have your left foot forward and your right foot back if you are right handed, the opposite if you are left handed.
Understand that with a left-foot forward stance your left hand will be your jab and your right will be your power, and the opposite if you have a right foot forward stance.

Bend your knees at all times. More power and reach come from your legs and butt.
Clench your fists with your thumb curled under your fingers, not loose on the outside, or you may break it.
;
, Your elbow should be pointing out to the side and slightly down.


For your power punch (right hand if your right handed and left hand if your left handed) do the same basic thing as your jab but since this is the hand that should be in the back (because of the way your stance is one foot forward) you must use your shoulder power and move your shoulder forward so you are getting more power into it.
Put even more power into your punch by turning your foot and rotating your body towards your target: This will give you three powerful points to your punch: the shoulder turn; the body turn; and the elbow extension.
Remember to lead with your jab and return it quickly back to your stance. Use it more frequently to set up the big ""knockout"" shot that you use with your back-hand.


, In all round-kicks you will be hitting your opponent with your shin! Not your foot! Stand in your stance and lift your back leg up so your knee is bent; rotate your hips in the direction you want to kick. Extend your leg and chop down at the area you want to kick. Make sure you rotate your foot when you kick, just like when punching, to get full power into your kicks.


Learn the three main side kicking areas that will inflict the most damage: the leg, the midsection, and the head.
Hit the thigh of your opponents leg right above the knee. If you hit your shin against theirs it will be painful to the both of you so condition yourself to give pain.
Aim for right, below the opponents ribs where the kidneys are for the midsection kicks.
Learn the best strike zones for a head kick: the jaw and on the temple. Head kicks are only good if you are flexible enough to reach your target without falling. Stretch and practice.


, Clinching is when both opponents are locked up, standing but holding on to each other. The martial art that focuses on strikes from the clinch is Muay Thai (Thai boxing).


Locked in a neutral clinch position each person will have an underhook. An underhook is when you have your arm hooked under your opponents bicep or armpit. Having two under hooks is an advantageous position. Other types of clinching include when you have your arms lock around your opponent’s waist. You can transition to this position from double underhooks by lowering yourself and locking your hands.


, Matt Hughes (the previous welterweight UFC Title holder) was famous for KO'ing people just with this slam. Also from that position you can knee your opponent in the calf.


Remember to keep your front foot steady so you don’t fall when kneeing any opponent.
Shoot your hips forward while kneeing. Kneeing is just as much in the hips as it is in the knees as you should as you follow through with the knee.


, It has been used to knock out opponents from the ground and practically anywhere else.


All punching power comes from your legs, butt and hips. Bend your legs(this is called sitting in your punches), you should point your toes in the direction your punch is being thrown and put your hips into it. This is how you get your body behind your punches.
Get your opponent up against a wall, fence or ring and transition your lead forearm up against their chest or if possible, the neck. This should hold them in position for at least a couple of seconds. The exact position you will be, your lead forearm against their neck and your back arm up against their shoulder. Your lead shoulder should be up against their shoulder trapping their arm. Quickly free your other arm from holding him against the wall and elbow your opponent in the face. It should be a quick fluid motion that follows through than quickly returns after it makes contact. The arm used for elbowing should be immediately returned to holding your opponents shoulder against the wall so he doesn’t escape.

Choose a Haft.,
Make a Mace Head.,
Make a Grip.",How to Make a Mace," The haft of your mace is the long piece which serves as both a handle and an anchor point for the weighted end. The best material you can choose for the haft's construction is steel. A 3/4"" pipe nipple about 18–24 inches (45.7–61.0 cm) long with a threaded cap at one end would work well, as will an old piece of rebar about 3/4"" wide.;
, A good mace head should be relatively compact and very dense to give best results.


A very simple option for making a mace head without access to a workshop is to make a wound wire mace.

To do this you'll need several lead weights (Ideally the ones used for balancing car wheels) and a long piece of wire, preferably steel.
Simply place the lead weights against haft, under the edge of the cap if you used a piece of pipe, running length ways along it and slowly begin to wrap the wire around them, being sure to keep as much tension on it as possible to create as tight of a hold as possible.
Build up this wire till the mace head is as heavy as you would like it to be.
To secure the wire, you can use a two layer wrap of duct tape or a hose clamp to hold down the end of the wire.



,


To make a simple grip, wrap layers of duct tape around the haft until it is a proper fit for your hand.
For a better grip, take a piece of rope approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm), knot each end and play about four inches of it against the haft length ways and wrap a piece of duct tape around it to secure it. Repeat the same step with the other end of the rope, opposite side of the pipe from the first. After this, wrap the duct tape around until the handle is built up enough to fit your hand comfortably. By doing this, you are making the handle an oval, which will rest more comfortably in your hand, and giving yourself a lanyard, so even if you lose your grip, the mace will not fly out of reach.

Stay near the sides of the ice rink.,
Keep your knees bent.,
Walk in place in your skates.,
Walk over the ice with your skates.,
Practice falling safely.,
Look in the direction you are skating, not at your feet.,
Skate gently forward.,
Combine left and right strides.,
Teach yourself how to brake.,
Improve your balance on either foot by skating in long strides.,
Lengthen your left and right alternating strides.",How to Learn Ice Skating by Yourself," Doing this will allow you to hold onto something if you feel that you are going to fall. Hold onto the walls to steady yourself while you get a feel for the ice, then let go when you feel ready.;
, Resist the urge to straighten up, especially if you feel you’re about to fall. Bending your knees will improve your balance and keep you steady.

, Practice little marching steps without going anywhere. This will help teach you how to keep your ankles from bending. It may feel silly, but not as much as wobbling your ankles in front of everyone will.

, Take small steps until you’re a few feet away from where you started. To prevent the foot you’re pushing back with from sliding backwards, keep both feet at a diagonal by pointing them outwards (like a duck’s feet). Get a feel for the way your skates want to slide on the ice and learn to correct it.

, Falling is inevitable, so don’t be embarrassed. Instead, learn how to fall safely. If you begin to lose your balance, try to squat down into a safer, more stable pose. If you must put your hands out to stop yourself, curl them into fists so that nobody skates over your fingers. Try to land on the flat parts of your fingers between the knuckles (as opposed to directly on the points of the knuckles) to make this more comfortable.

, This will help you keep your balance and go in the right direction, as your body tends to steer toward wherever your head is pointing. Moreover, it will help keep you from colliding with another skater.

, Place your weight on your dominant foot and place the weaker foot slightly behind it and at an angle. Then, push gently with your weaker foot, gliding slightly forward on the dominant one. Allow yourself to stop naturally, then repeat with the other foot until you are comfortable keeping your balance on both sides.

, Once you can stride forward on either foot, try to transition between striding on the left foot and right foot with little or no pause in between.

, One way to do this is to shift your weight to your dominant foot and drag the point of the other skate on the ground behind you (much as you do with the rubber brakes on the fronts of rollerskates). Another, more advanced way to do this is to place your weight on the foot in front of you, twist it at an angle across your path, and lean your weight away from it so that it cuts/scrapes the ice in front of you to slow you down. This takes much more practice and balance.

, Push off with one foot and glide on the other as before, but this time, do it a little harder to give yourself more momentum and glide much farther across the ice. Lean slightly into the glide and test your balance by lifting the other foot slightly off the ground. Brake or allow yourself to slow naturally. Repeat on the other side.

, Now that you can both alternate strides and balance on either foot, combine these methods to skate like a true ice skater. As you get better, your speed will increase naturally.

Learn the Niman opening stance.,
Remember that Niman was developed from a dual blade style of the same name.,
Learn the bare bones of Shii-Cho, Soresu, Ataru, Shien and Djem So.,
Try to incorporate Force attacks.",How to Learn the Basics of Niman," There are three variations:

The blade is held one-handed, out to the side, angled up and back. The off-hand is folded across the chest. The feet are evenly spaced.
The blade is held two-handed, above the head, angled upwards and slightly in. the dominant foot is placed forwards.
The handle is held two-handed at the waist, with the blade angled downwards and to the side. the feet are placed close together.;
, Dual blade Niman users are encouraged to use a shoto (short-bladed lightsaber) in their off hand. It is often studied as a prelude to Jar'kai, a non-mainstream form specifically for dual blades., These are the styles incorporated into Niman, so if you learn the absolute basics of each one, you should be OK., To compensate for it's relaxed bladework, Niman incorporates Force attacks into it's training. Although you (probably) can't use the Force in real life, you can still try stuff like pulling and shoving (or kicking - no big heavy boots please!) your opponents. The main two Niman Force attacks are:

Pushing slash - slash your opponent, then shove them away with the Force while they're disoriented.
Draw closer - pull your opponent into range with the Force, then hit them with your lightsaber.

Learn the general theories and concepts of sparring:

Repetition: Different techniques at the same level, or same technique at different levels.,
Learn the standard fighting stances:

Empty weighted lead






Weighted lead or Back leg fighter






Standing






Elongated back stance






Elongated front stance






Hands up






Hands down






Weak side hand






Strong side hand






Elbow in line to hip.







,
Recognize what type of fighter your opponent is and adjust to effectively combat that style.,
Be a sensitive fighter.",How to Spar,"



 


Forcing: Moving the opponent in a certain direction so to force them in a specific direction. Or, to make the opponent limit their techniques given a specific situation.






Rushing: Overwhelming the opponent by a burst of technique, usually in groups of three so to render the opponent defenseless. Using a bombardment of technique that the opponent will never block thus hindering their ability to fight successfully, consequently making a break in their defense.






“T” ing up: Moving the opponent’s weight to the front leg then side-stepping the opponents strong side and making your hip line up with their belly button. Then give the hit. Works well on SAME SIDE grab position.






Drawing: Making the opponent do a certain reaction so then you can capitalize on that specific reaction.






Baiting: Opening up your defense so the opponent will take the opening then capitalizing with the counterattack.






Feints (Fakes): Deceiving the opponent with one technique to catch them in the follow-up technique. Making the opponent think you’re doing one technique when you’re really setting them up for something else.






Intercepting: Either by hitting the opponent at his start up, or as the technique is finishing. Done by opponents telegraph or by set pattern.






Tempo: Change tempo to off balance opponent. Never play opponent’s tempo unless there is more opportunity. Vary stepping patterns, evasive movements, and techniques.






Distance Control: Closing and opening the gap between you and the opponent. The hardest to control. Take control of the center to take control of your opponent. If opponent is taller, then step inside range. If opponent is shorter, then keep opponent inside your range but out of theirs. Distance is equal to your 90 degree sidekick.






Recognize that it's a lot less painful and tiring to simply move out of range instead of blocking your opponent's kicks. This serves two purposes:

You don't get bruises from blocking the kicks of somebody who may be quite a bit bigger than you.
You frustrate your opponent, who looks like he doesn't know what s/he is doing since s/he keeps kicking air. The flip side of this is when you are the person doing the kicking.


To master distance control, learn to quickly judge the following:

Your distance from your opponent - is s/he in your kicking range?
His/her distance from you - are you in his/her kicking range?


Realize that your opponent will not voluntarily stand at just the right distance for you to do your magical 5-hit combo Fatality. You need to close or open the gap as needed.
""Out of range"" doesn't necessarily mean ""too far away"". It means ""at a distance where your opponent can't kick you without having to adjust their distance from you in some fashion"". You could be too close or too far from them.

;
,,

If your opponent is a lead leg fighter and is taller than you, you should force/draw them into taking a step. That will put most of their weight onto their lead leg. Consequently, they will no longer be able to attack with their front leg without any weight shift. Never rush a lead leg fighter. Breaking down their defense is very hard to do because you have to immobilize that lead leg. One way to do that is to set them into a pattern then forcefully knock down the lead leg and move to the weak side and then make the rush. Baiting a lead leg fighter is a great tactic if they fall into a certain pattern. You can also bait the opponent to see what targets they’re looking for when you open up.






If your opponent is a weighted lead leg fighter or back leg fighter, avoid moving to the opponent’s strong side while they're in a lead leg stance. Your main goal is to move to their weak side or rush them back. Since they are a back leg fighter, they have no problem fighting while moving forward. However, if you make them move backwards, they will not be able to attack you with their primary weapon, their back leg. Being on the offense and using repetition so to keep the opponent blocking will hinder them from attacking. Also to note, when they’re moving backwards their lead foot becomes very light, so capitalize with a sweep.






If opponent is in cross side stance it is a great kick to close the distance or to start conflict to then work off of. If the opponent is in the same side stance the axe kick is a great kick to finalize the rush. If opponent is rushed on the same side they have a very small window of opportunity to capitalize on your weakness. To point out your weakness it is your second step of your rush. There you are transitioning from hips closed to hips open, but after the third step is beginning the weakness disappears because you are back to having a closed stance. The axe kick is a great kick if you are a shorter person trying to catch a taller person off guard, or a taller person trying to dominate a shorter person with superior reach and flexibility. In a kicking contest, the axe kick is an unblockable kick. It can only be blocked at two points in its execution and those points are relatively hard to block. One point is as the knee is starting to lift it can be blocked there, and at the peak of the foot the kick can be nudged to expose a weakness. Anywhere else the opponent will be crushed due to the momentum created by the kick. Another point is the axe kick can be integrated into a lot of combos and fakes, so it is a versatile tool to use against your opponent. The beginning of the axe kick looks very similar to a front kick so one could easily set up a front kick, front kick, to axe kick combo. So, to conclude, whatever one's fighting style may be: lead leg, back leg, center weighted, whatever, the axe kick is a very useful tool to practice and dominate.







,

Feel what the opponent’s reaction is than try to go against it. For example, if the opponent is pulling away from a technique and you trying to overpower them, the better option would to be to switch midway through the technique. This is easier said than done. When the body is already committed it is nearly impossible to then not commit to the desired movement. This works for the attacker and defender. When the attacker is totally committed to an attack, there is no pulling back from that point of return. It is the same with the defender, if they are totally committed to defending the attack they can’t switch mid-motion to block another.






Recognize what areas you are exposing during your moves. Every movement leaves open a target area. When you attack or defend an opening occurs and a spot of venerability shows through.

Combine styles for maximum effect.",How to Learn the Basics of Ataru," The dominant foot was held back, and the lightsaber was held to the side at chest height, pointing upwards.
, Ataru is all about acrobatics. The main two types in Ataru are rotational acrobatics (spins, flips and cartwheels) and translational acrobatics (running and jumping). Taking up parkour might be helpful., Ataru is more aggressive than the previous forms. It consists of short, energetic bursts of attacks, all linked together. Ataru is very versatile - it can be used with dual blades, a double bladed lightsaber, or even in unarmed combat., Ataru can be extremely tiring. Just think about what you are doing - jumping and spinning about the place, always attacking. For this reason, you need to take down your opponent quickly., Ataru does require a good deal of space to perform acrobatics in. You can't practise Ataru in your bedroom - there isn't enough space. You need a big, open hallway, or even go and practise outside (you may get some funny looks, but hey - you're using a lightsaber, so who cares?)., Ataru does lack defensive capabilities. It's recommended to learn another form, such as Soresu (Form III) or Niman (Form VI) and using a combination of both."

American boxing focuses heavily on punches.
Tae Kwon Do and Karate focuses on punches and kicks.;
, Striking skills must be combined with grappling and wrestling skills if you want to be a well-rounded fighter. Common grappling styles include Brazillian jiu-jitsu, Judo, Greco-Roman wrestling, and American wrestling.Brazillian jiu-jitsu practitioners specialize in gaining a superior grappling position as well as choking and submitting their opponent.
Judo concentrates on locks and throws.

, Do a search online and look for gyms, dojos, and clubs that offer fighting or martial arts classes in your area. See if you can find general MMA classes that have both striking and grappling included in their curriculum. If a hybrid gym doesn't exist, you may have to go to more than one gym to build both your grappling and striking skills.If you don't live in a major city there may not be classes for the particular styles that you want to learn. Stay flexible.
Sites like FindMMAGyms and Fight Resource have an archive of MMA gyms across the U.S.A.
For instance, if there are no MMA gyms near you, you can sign up for both kickboxing and jiu-jitsu classes separately.

, If you don't have a stand-up or grappling gym in your area, you can supplement some of your training with online instructional videos. Search online and find instructional videos made by professionals and watch them to fill the gaps in your training.Nothing can beat in-person training.

, Once you find the gyms in your area, you should call them and schedule your first class. Some gyms offer a trial class that's free of charge if it's your first time training.

When you call you can say something like ""Hello, I've never trained before but I wanted to register for my first class. When is the next introductory class and how much does it cost?""

, Typically you'll be expected to get your own mouth guard and cup. Other gyms will require you to buy a gi or other fighting gear. You should wear a regular t-shirt and gym shorts to most first classes, but make sure to ask the trainer to see if there's anything specific you need to wear.

Other fighting gear includes gloves, hand wraps, shin guards and headgear.If you don't have any gear, ask if they have equipment that you can borrow.

Listen to all of the directions from your instructor.,
Pace yourself.,
Don't be too hard on yourself and stay positive.",How to Begin Mixed Martial Arts2," Everyone was a beginner at some point, so they understand what it's like to be new at MMA. The people at the gym are there to learn and become better fighters so don't act like a hotshot or you'll give off a bad first impression. Be nice to the people you meet, keep a positive attitude, and be receptive to advice., When you start training it's important that you follow all of the instructions given by your instructor. If you don't, you could injure yourself or someone else. Pay close attention to everything your instructor has to say and try to execute the moves exactly as you're taught., During your first couple of classes, you may feel like you have something to prove, but you don't. You might be tempted to go full intensity as soon as you hit the mat or ring, but this will just make you exhausted and unable to train further. Remember to breathe deeply and try to execute the moves and work on your technique rather than exhausting all of your energy., If you don't have experience with martial arts, it's possible that you'll be sparring against someone more experienced. Don't expect to be amazing at fighting if you've had no training. It will most likely take you a lot of hours and work training before you can compete in your gym. It's important to keep this in mind so that you don't get discouraged."

Get the basics down first.,
Go to class regularly.,
Don't overtrain.,
Spar with your classmates.,
Roll with your classmates.,
Work on your strength and conditioning.,
Sign up for amateur competitions.,
Maintain a healthy diet.",How to Begin Mixed Martial Arts3," To get better at MMA, you'll need to become proficient in basic strikes and grappling techniques. The basic punches include hooks, jabs, straights, and uppercuts. You'll also want to learn basic push and roundhouse kicks. In grappling, you'll want to learn the different positions and how to do basic moves like armbars, triangle chokes, and the rear naked choke.Practice mastering these basic techniques before advancing to more elaborate techniques., Going to class regularly will keep your skills sharp and can keep you in shape. Try not to take too much time off in between classes when you're starting off. Go to at least three classes per week and then pace yourself to see how many classes you feel comfortable going to each week., While being sore is natural, you don't want to overdo it. When you get physically fatigued, overly sore, or injured, take time off from training and let your body recover. If you don't let your body recover from training, you can become weaker and less focused. Fatigue, weakness, decreased performance, and constant muscle soreness are signs of overtraining., Sparring is the portion of your training when you get to test your technique on a fellow classmate. Don't be scared to exchange punches and kicks with your classmate. When sparring, go in with an end goal in mind, like scoring a flush roundhouse kick or working to improve your distance making with your jab.Work on perfecting the basics on a moving target, and remember to pace yourself.
The goal of sparring is to perfect your technique, not to hurt your opponent.
It's good manners to shake your opponent's hand before and after sparring.
Sparring partners will often try to match your intensity, so expect to get what you give.

, Rolling is when you practice your grappling techniques on a classmate without incorporating strikes. Grappling and wrestling can be grueling, and it takes a lot of endurance, so take your time and pace yourself. Practice getting out of tough situations, gaining superior positioning, and trying various submissions., Even though training and practicing technique is essential, it's also important that you work to improve your strength and endurance. Squats, deadlifts, and bench presses combined with regular sprinting, jump rope, and stretching will make you stronger, quicker, and more flexible. Designate one or two days a week in your training to work on your strength and conditioning along with your technique training., Make sure to check with the local governing body for fighting sports in your state before you sign up to compete so that you're aware of all rules and regulations. Typically when you're ready to fight, your gym or trainer will help you register for an organized competition. Talk to them and make a decision on which kind of competition or fight you want to compete in., Keep track of the things you're eating by writing down the different meals that you have throughout the day and counting your calorie and nutrient intake. You'll want to hydrate yourself and maintain a diet that's high in protein and carbohydrates. If you're training heavily, try to maintain a diet of 1 gram of carbs and protein per pound that you weigh. Your diet should also contain plenty of omega-3 fats and traditional vitamins and minerals."

Their skillful espionage and guerrilla tactics go beyond the skills of a traditional warrior. To learn the way of the ninja, you must adjust to operating after sundown.Practice moving in complete darkness. This will help you use your environment to perceive the world around you.


When you travel at night, you should try to avoid any street lamps or other artificial sources of light.
Getting your eyes to adjust to true darkness is half the battle of learning to travel in the dark. Ninjas learned both ""static vision,"" which is grabbing something still in the darkness, and ""dynamic vision,"" which involves catching something moving at night. Try both of these tactics. Juggling in the dark is great way to practice.;
, In addition to their stealth tactics, a ninja must be extremely nimble. No wall is too large to traverse, and all objects blocking your path are surmountable. Being comfortable climbing trees is the best way to practice nimble movement strategies.The ninja often traversed castle walls by scaling trees and hopping from tree to wall.


You might want to invest in a pair of hand and foot clawsand practice climbing trees using them. This will help you get a better grip into the bark of the tree.
Getting to the higher ground of tree branches will not only help you avoid enemies, but will also give you a better view of your surroundings. From this height, you'll be able to plan your espionage strategies more accurately, as you'll have a clear view of your current location.

, Part of blending into your environment is using it to your advantage.Start with the most basic hiding posture, otherwise known as Uzura-Gakure. This requires you to draw your limbs and head into your body, becoming as small as possible. If you remain completely still, you can hide among rocks in your natural environment. You also want to use trees to conceal yourself.


Another aspect of this strategy is Kannon-Gakure, where you'll cover your face and stand in front of a tree. By hiding your face, you'll blend into the tree and take advantage of the blind spot of the human eye.
Ninjas also often hide behind trees. Much like Uzura-Gakure, you must become as still as possible, even stiller than the leaves blowing in the wind. If you can be stiller than the leaves, your enemies will only see their motion, making your body become practically undetectable.

, A true ninja practices ""the art of invisibility,"" attempting to move through space without notifying their enemies of their presence. While the modern ninja must cope with a larger amount of human-made light, many evasion strategies from feudal Japan can still be used today.


The stealth walk is the simplest of these methods. If you guide your steps onto the outer edge of your feet, you'll muffle the sound of a normal footstep. Practice on gravel or sand, as you'll be able to assess the sound of your steps as well as the footprint left behind by your motion.
Distraction and misdirection will also help you avoid suspicion from your enemies. This might involve you tossing a stone away from your path, or, in present day, having someone call the phone of the person you are attempting to move past. They will direct their focus toward the other sound, giving you ample time to sneak past.
You can also use common sounds, like dripping water or the hum of a radiator, to mask the sound of your own motion.

, While the ability to quickly scale walls is extremely important to your training, you also want to make sure that your stamina remains intact. While your goal is to evade startling your enemies, you also want to make sure that you're confident in escaping any unforeseen conflict. If you're being tailed by a foe, your espionage strategies may not be as useful as pure speed.


The Thirty-Sixty Speed Training is a simple way to improve your cardiovascular strength and sprint speed.Get a stopwatch and find a place to run without any obstacles. You'll start by jogging for 60 seconds. After this jog, sprint for as quickly as you can for 30 seconds, then jog for another 60. You'll repeat this cycle three more times, and it should take you exactly seven minutes.
Make sure that you aren't resting completely in your jog. This should feel like a passive recovery, but you want to make sure you're keeping your heart rate up. It's very likely that you'll have to sprint for over 30 seconds when running from an enemy, so you want to prepare for the worst.

, It's important, as a ninja, to have the strength to jump with force, as you'll need this to scale walls and hop between surfaces. When paired with your climbing and running skills, you'll be able evade attacks from your enemy if you ever engage them in combat. You also want to strengthen your legs, as great deal of your physical power will be held within them.Some exercises that you can do to improve your jumping skills and leg strength include:


Perform lunges across the room. This will strengthen your quad muscles.
Move in tiptoe to strengthen your calves. By walking on tiptoe, you'll also practice moving more quietly, which will improve your skills in espionage.
Jump as high as you can, on flat ground, until you feel exhausted. These are also known as box jumps.
Sit in a horse-riding stance, bending your knees deeply and keeping your legs shoulder-width apart, for a significant amount of time. This squat will strengthen your legs. You can also jump repeatedly out of a squat, much like a box jump.
Put your leg into the air, about waist high, and hold it there. This is otherwise known as a side-leg kick. Maintain this position for as long as possible.
If you have access to weight training equipment, train your legs with weighted squats and leg presses. The stronger your legs are, the more force you'll be able to put into your jumps.

, A large part of learning the way of the ninja, especially in modern times, is using the weight of your body to gain strength. These exercises are also much easier to incorporate into your training, as you won't need any expensive exercise equipment.Remember that mastering these exercises takes some time, as they require full engagement from your entire body, rather than just one isolated muscle.

, While many of the martial arts can be incorporated into your combat strategies as a ninja, taekwondo is one of the oldest and most tried of these schools of thought.One of the major advantages of mastering taekwondo is that it focuses on using the legs, rather than the hands. Your enemies, especially if they are untrained in combat, are very likely to attack you with their fists.


From the get-go, your mastery of taekwondo will give you a leg up in the event of an attack. Your legs also have a larger range of motion than your hands when taking down enemies coming from all sides of you.
Break boards to improve your speed, precision, and power. You'll also need an immense amount of focus to snap a board, as it requires bringing your foot down on the perfect snapping point of the plank. Remember that you must think about moving through the board, not simply onto the board itself.Aim for a spot that is past the board, and your foot will move through it with power.
Make sure that whoever is holding your board has a firm grip, as this is half the reason that you'll be able to bring your force through the wood to snap it.

, When engaging in combat, the ninja can also fight with a staff. This is useful in taking on a large number of enemies, especially as your foes may be approaching you with similarly blunt and powerful objects. One of the best staffs to train with is the bo staff, a tall staff usually made out of red or white oak. The bo staff has been used by the ninja since their beginnings in feudal Japan. Often deemed as an ""extension of one's limbs,"" the movement of a bo staff is meant to mirror open-handed movements in martial arts.
Your stance contains a great deal of your power when fighting with a bo staff. The placement of your feet will dictate a great deal of your upper body strength, and you'll be able to strike your enemies differently depending on your foot placement.You want to learn a wide variety of striking strategies. This will ensure that you have a keen eye for weak spots on your enemies. Pairing these strategies with your most nimble stances will maximize your dexterity with the bo staff.Remember to practice your attack strategies in a safe and open location, as you don't want to be harming those around you or causing any unnecessary damage to your home.

, To be a proper ninja, you must blend in completely to your location, whether this is in a busy city square or out in the forest, isolated from all human contact.Because a ninja must evade suspicion from enemies at all time, it's crucial to adapt your attire to fit your surroundings.


The most basic ninja outfit is the traditional head wrap and robe, otherwise known as the zukin and the shozoku, respectively. Contrary to popular belief, these outfits are actually not black, but actually are made from a dark blue fabric. Because a ninja wears the zukin and shozuku when traveling through the night, the dark blue blends into both the darkness and the moonlight, minimizing the risk of drawing attention from foes. The ninja also wears combat sandals, simultaneously lightweight and supportive when moving quickly.
In addition to the traditional ninja garb, you also must learn to disguise yourself to travel unnoticed in the daytime.Some of the traditional ninja disguises include monks, merchants, and actors. There are many disguise roles for a ninja, but it's best for you to be concealed as a traveler. This way, you can enter any town and be perceived as a stranger, making your unfamiliar presence not seem abnormal.

, Controlling your breath is crucial to fully inhabiting the life of the ninja. Because you need to hide for long periods of time, remaining as still and silent as possible, you need to be able to quiet your breath. Practice some of these strategies, which will not only help you evade attention, but will also improve your mindfulness:


Breathe in time with your steps. You will naturally enter the flow of your motion and assure that you're keeping an even flow of oxygen into your body. When running, aim for a 3:2 ratio, allowing your in breath to cover three of your steps, and your out breath to cover two. When walking, you can use the more meditative 4:2 ratio.
Practice deep breathing. Proper breath expands your whole torso. Practice breathing into your abdomen as often as possible, until it becomes habit.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth while walking. Running requires more oxygen, so you'll need to breathe in through your mouth and nose at the same time.

, To ensure that their bodies moved quickly and efficiently, ninjas adhered to a strict and lean diet.You want to minimize your meat, dairy, and sugars, as these foods take longer for your bodies to process into energy. Light foods that are also high in protein, like pine nuts, are good for your lean ninja figure. It's also rumored that pine nuts improve your sensory perception and can help in the anti-aging process.


You cannot eat any food that can lead to unforeseen body odor. If your enemies can smell your presence at any time, then you will arouse suspicion. It's not enough to simply be unseen or unheard by your opponents. You cannot be detected with any sense.

, Because so much of the existence of the ninja hinges on being undetectable, you must be careful not to train in the presence of potential enemies. Finding a secluded location, especially when practicing your skills in combat or evasion, is crucial to maintaining the secrecy of your identity.

, It's very difficult to properly inhabit the life of a ninja if you have a larger number of possessions or ties to any one location. You need to constantly be in motion, as well as completely adaptable to any environment that you enter.Because of this, it's best to not hold on too dearly to any unnecessary clutter or worldly possessions. They will simply hold you down and become cumbersome to your constant traveling. You must be present in the world around you, constantly assessing your surrounding with an even and open mind.


Embrace a minimalist lifestyle by cutting down your possessions to the essentials.

Use throwing stars to inflict minor wounds.,
Favor small, sharp daggers for covert self-defense.,
Engage in near and mid-range attacks with a blowgun.,
Wear a spiked metal ring for surprise attacks.",How to Choose Ninja Weapons1," Throwing stars are trademark ninja weapons. They come in many different sizes, but essentially they are flat pieces of metal with sharpened tips that can be thrown at enemies from a distance.Throwing stars were originally created as non-lethal weapons meant to distract or slow down an enemy, but soon proved useful in delivering serious, though not life threatening, wounds.They could be turned into lethal weapons by dipping the pointed tips in poison before throwing them.
The ninja called throwing stars ""shuriken"" which means “sword hidden in the hand.”;
, The ninja called these ""kunai."" These daggers had short handles and their blades were leaf-shaped with extremely sharp points. Because of their small size, they were easy to conceal and throw.


""Kunai"" were used for many purposes, including climbing, digging and hammering, and they made perfect make-shift spear ends.Their sharpness and small size made ""kunai"" very useful weapons that could be carried at all times.
Because of their portability, they were very helpful during surprise attacks.

, Most ninja included a blowgun in their arsenal called a ""fukiya."" They were used to shoot darts at enemies from a distance and were valued because they were easy to conceal and transport. ""Fukiya"" were silent and very accurate weapons.The darts the ninja used were very sharp. They were capable of inflicting serious wounds and bone damage.Often the ninja would cover the tips of their darts with poison to make them lethal., Ninja called these rings ""kakute"" and they were usually made of metal and worn on the middle finger.They were very easy to conceal and had extremely sharp spikes that were often dipped in poison to deliver a lethal wound.When used to kill, ""kakute"" were more efficient and less messy than swords.
Ninja also used ""kakute"" to strangle an opponent by jabbing the spikes directly into their neck.
It was hard for an enemy to figure out how a comrade was killed when a ""kakute"" was involved because it left little evidence behind.

Use a durable wooden sword for non-lethal combat.,
Travel light on missions with a multipurpose ""ninja-to."",
Use ""nunchakus"" for versatility in combat.,
Go basic and traditional with a 6 foot long bamboo staff.A bamboo staff, or a ""bo,"" was one of the most important ninja weapons.",How to Choose Ninja Weapons2," The ninja called this a ""bokken."" These were traditionally used to train for sword combat. However, many ninja preferred them to actual swords for attacking enemies, since they were lighter, easy to maneuver and more portable than a traditional sword.


Since ""bokken"" were made of strong, dense wood and were very effective in combat.
Another bonus when using a ""bokken"" – unlike with a sharp metal sword, the ninja couldn’t accidentally injure themselves with a ""bokken."", The ninja sword, called a ""ninja-to,"" was shorter and lighter than a traditional sword. ""Ninja-to"" were used in sword combat, and they also aided in travel by helping the ninja scale walls quickly and easily.


The ""ninja-to"" scabbards were fashioned to be several inches longer than their blades. The extra space inside the scabbard was used as a secret compartment to hide small weapons and poisons.Since the ""ninja-to"" were cheap to make, they provided the additional advantage of being disposable in difficult combat situations. It could be left behind when a quick escape is needed, for example., ""Nunchakus"" (or nunchucks) were very portable, making them a great choice for the ninja. ""Nunchakus"" could be useful in almost any combat situation as both offensive and defensive weapons, capable of blocking blows from swords and staffs.


""Nunchakus"" were also used to disarm enemies wielding swords by tangling the blade between the two sticks and yanking it out of the opponent’s hand.
It was also possible for a skilled ninja to strangle an enemy with nunchakus., These staffs were hollow and had a wide range of offensive and defensive moves, making them handy and practical.Because a bamboo staff looked harmless enough and wouldn’t call any attention to the ninja, it was a great weapon to carry around out in the open and use in surprise attacks on enemies.The ninja also used the hollow staff to hide poison darts in. With a quick flick of the wrist, a ninja could use the ""bo"" to unleash a poison dart on an unsuspecting opponent.
They also occasionally hid small knives (such as the ""kunai"") in the hollow end of the ""bo"" for use in combat.

Slow an enemy down with caltrops.,
Wear spiked claws on your feet to aid in climbing.,
Defend yourself in close quarters with handheld spikes.,
Cover your tracks with ""ashiaro.""",How to Choose Ninja Weapons3," Caltrops, known to the ninja as ""tetsu-bishi,"" were small metal objects with 4 sharp points that were thrown on the ground to slow down an enemy pursuing you.They were made so that regardless of how they landed on the ground, one of the sharp points would be facing up. A ninja would scatter them behind himself when being chased, and since almost everyone wore sandals back then, the sharp caltrops would pierce the feet of the enemy.


Caltrops could also be scattered around castle walls or camps to stop spies from invading the area.
The ninja sometimes covered the sharp points of caltrops with poison to make them lethal to their opponents.They could also be thrown at enemies, if necessary.

, ""Ashiko"" are spiked devices, usually made of steel, that the ninja wore on their feet to help them climb and scale things quickly and efficiently. ""Ashiko"" also helped the ninja easily navigate any terrain.


These spikes were most effective when strapped to the balls of the feet.Along with aiding the ninja in movement, ""ashiko"" were also used as weapons to deliver lethal kicks to an opponent.,""Shoku"" were metal contraptions that the ninja slipped over their knuckles. They had 4 sharped spikes that protruded from the palm, and were used like an animal would use its claws to defend itself in close quarters. You could swipe an enemy in the face and use the backside to break their jaw. ""Shoku"" could also block and even break an opponent’s sword if used correctly.


""Shoku"" (which means tiger claws) also helped the ninja climb trees and walls very quickly.
""Shoku"" were often used in conjunction with the previously mentioned ""ashiko"" – the spiked claws that they attached to their feet.

, These were makeshift soles that were carved out of wood and strapped to the ninja’s feet. ""Ashiaro"" were carved to look like other types of footprints, like bear or dog footprints, to hide their tracks, prevent enemies from following them, and to walk in enemy territory.


Some ""ashiaro"" were even carved to look like a child’s footprints, which would cleverly fool an opponent."

Currently, the emphasis is on judo being a spectator sport with a lot of action. A lot of action translates to constant movement and lots of throwing techniques rather than arm bars, pins and chokes.


Watch You Tube videos of matches and model your style from top level competitors.
Learn the rules of competition by asking the referees, your teacher and reading. Winning is all that matters, know the rules and be clever. Do whatever it takes.;
, It's a good idea to choose one that participates in the most tournaments, so that you can enter additional tournaments on your own or with other members of your club. Your tournament life will be short, after you get older it will be impractical to risk injury, so live in the moment and compete as much as possible.


Besides participating in tournaments, watch videos of the Olympic and world championship tournaments.

, You must be in great condition and be able to act without hesitation when your opponent is vulnerable. The person without a grip is at a big disadvantage.


Study and develop this technique. Be patient when coming to grips. If you are not fighting (sparring) for a grip, like the top Judo players, your play has a big hole that you should work on.
In tournaments, do not insist on the traditional sleeve and lapel grip. Do supplementary work by applying force with your forearms, crook of the elbow, hands close together, grasping thick bars, and from awkward positions (but mechanically sound positions, so as to avoid injury).

, It is vital to thoroughly develop from there, like a flow chart, in order to be able to quickly respond to the myriad situations that can––and will––happen. Here are a few important techniques to master:


Be able throw in all directions and modify your throws against all types of opponents. Do not excessively favor your dominant side.
Have a handful of throws that you specialize in, but be familiar with all of the throws used. With these throws, you can make combinations, feints and drawing schemes.
Prepare for all that can happen. Use all variations of your throws as is necessary. It's recommended that you read books about throwing techniques because they will provide a planned and thorough presentation of the many variations and contingencies.

Use techniques from other sports that were derived from martial arts and especially amateur wrestling but also sumo belt grabbing and arm leverage moves.

, In competition, full scores are achieved with the thinnest of margins: do not expect to see much textbook application of techniques in tournaments. A point is a point, but if all points could be graded on a scale of one to ten, many points barely make the grade and are merely one, two or three. The end justifies the means.

, Your opponent, when you are executing your throw, will not give you a clean fall. Instead, your opponent will neglect safety, wrap you like being tackled in football, and take you down too. Expect to complete your throw, with extreme follow-through and end up in an awkward situation and with your back turned to your opponent. With extreme follow-through, fall on your opponent and expect your opponent to fall on you too, if you wrap him up when he is trying to throw you. Proper break-falls are virtually ignored in competition.

,


At the completion of a throw, with extreme follow-through, and with your back turned to your opponent, you must turn and face your opponent.
When on the mat, to escape a pin, you must bridge and rotate out of the back on the mat position.
When being thrown, you must spin and fall on your knees to avoid having your opponent being awarded the score.
Do waist twists as a warm up, but do some waist twisting with much more resistance; be creative. Use a partner, weights, sandbags, bicycle inner tubes, something, anything to develop your waist muscles. Do twisting variations of exercises that you already do. Rotate your spine just a little, instead rotate your body around your spine.

, You will be upside down and in all types of awkward positions, so get used to it and prepare for it: tournament judo is not like class judo.


When being thrown, you must reverse your position and not get thrown on your back. At the very least, practice cartwheels and do some upside down, body weight press-ups.
At risk to your elbows, you must take some falls on one arm to avoid giving your opponent the point. Relax with yoga headstands.

, Do not replace your class with your supplementary training program though; going to the judo class is the priority.


Stretch, throughout the day and every day. Study stretching.
Form, in addition to stretching, can be done often, do it often. Practice simple and complex techniques and counters. Make a playbook, or a mental playbook, and go through the scenarios that can (and will) happen. Mental training can be done anywhere, so do it!
Complement your club workouts with a supplementary training routine.

, Many Olympic athletes cycle their training, so do the same. Cycle everything, your strength, flexibility, skill, and psyche, and expect to get criticized by those who say they put 100 percent all the time. Your resources are limited, use them in a clever way.


If you can do 40 push ups year round, with cycling you would do just 30 push ups for most of the year and work up to doing 50 push ups 5 times a year such as in the wavelike pattern on the graph. The five times a year when your are very strong would be when you have a tournament.
Choose and plan your supplementary training very carefully and thoughtfully. Consider your time, finances, fighting style, available equipment, capabilities, recovery capability, and inclination. For example, if your tournament career will be ending soon, build your strength, focus on simple techniques and in tournaments attack like a tiger. But if you have many tournament ahead of you, gain experience and develop your skills.
Examples of supplementary training: weights, a partner, sandbags, running, wrestling, machines, bicycle tubes, gymnastics, drills, skill movements, etc, be creative.

, Focus on tournaments and set your ego aside in practice. Be cunning––your buddies in practice may be your opponents in tournaments.


Do not show off in practice, have a lot in reserve for tournaments. Aggression wears on the nerves, there are many other aspects of judo that you can practice in regular practice sessions and especially against others who are not competitive.
Do not lose your humanity, your club mates are your friends.
In tournaments, lose your humanity, but do not try to hurt your opponent.

, Body fat will not help you unless you are in the highest weight class.

, You must be very sensitive to your limitations and avoid over-training. Be aware (your eyes focus with muscles, rest those muscles and your brain) and adjust to the changing conditions, do not perform like a robot. Get everything together by tournament time, plan it that way.

Choose your blades.,
Choose your grip.,
Practise the basic forms.,
Don't become reliant on your second blade!,
Understand the limitations of dual blades.,
Don't hit your lightsabers together!",How to Learn the Basics of Jar'kai1," Most Jedi prefer to wield a shoto - a short (~60cm blade) lightsaber - in their off hand, as it is easier to maneuvre. You can wield two shotos or two full-length lightsabers if you prefer. Some Jedi used a guard shoto - a shoto with a handle coming out of the side, like a police baton.
, You can wield both blades with either a standard or a reverse grip, or do one of each. As the shoto is easier to maneuvre, if you have one, I would recommend using it for the reversed grip., Ataru and Niman are particularly suited for dual blades, but they can also be applied to the other forms. Start slowly so that you don't stab yourself with your own lightsabers, then build up speed when you're more confident., If you lose your second blade, you'll be in big trouble. Practise with only one blade at least as much as you practise with both., If you use dual blades, you cannot use a two-handed grip. This means that your blocks and attacks will be weaker than usual. If you're inside, dual blades are harder to maneuver within the confines of the walls., One of the worst things you can do in Jar'kai is accidentally block your own attack with your second blade."

Hold your arms behind your back.,
Turn your palms face up (optional).,
Bend forward.,

Land on the ball of your foot.,
Flex your ankle as you land.,
Use these techniques while walking.,
Brush the ground with the outside edge of your foot.,
Roll that foot inward.,
Repeat with the next foot.,
Walk in the dark.,
Adjust your walk for carpets.",How to Run Like a Ninja," Ninjas in manga and anime usually run with their arms extended straight out behind their backs. It might be harder to run this way, but it looks cool!


Sometimes, the ninja holds one hand in front of his face instead, to deflect attacks with his forearm or with a weapon held in a reverse grip.;
, Before they can join the ninja army, ninjas must learn to display their palms to the sky. Or at least you'd think so from watching Naruto and the shows it influenced.

, Bend your knees and tilt your whole torso forward. This gives your enemies a smaller target to notice or hit with ranged weaponry.


Lift your head up by bending your neck only, so you can see where you're running.

, Now for the hardest part: running in this position. This can take different leg muscles than ordinary running, but keep practicing and you'll get faster. Once you can run fairly fast without falling over, train with the instructions below so you can run up behind your enemies without being heard.

, Run in soft, rubber-soled shoes instead of stiff, hard-soled boots.If you have a treadmill or a safe, clear place to run, you can practice barefoot.


Socks are quieter than bare feet when running indoors, but are too slippery to use on wooden floors and other slick materials.

, Breathe in a steady pattern as you run. This helps keep your stride even, and makes it easier to listen to the sound of your footfalls. Count the number of steps you take as you breathe. Breathe in through your nos for three steps. Breathe out through your mouth for two steps.Take full, deep breaths that expand your chest.

, If you hear loud slapping sounds as your feet hit the ground, you're probably landing on your heels.Land on the middle or ball of your foot instead to run more quietly and avoid injury.

, Absorb some of the impact of your footfall by letting your ankle bend when you hit the ground.Do this by keeping your ankles and feet relaxed as you land, then tensing up again only to lift off for the next step.


Ironically, this might actually be more difficult in the ninja pose. Try it in a normal running position, then adapt it to your ninja run once you've got the hang of it.

, Walking silently takes different techniques than running silently, so don't confuse the two. Once you're close to your target, slow down and creep up behind them silently using this method, called ""fox walking.""


Straighten up and get out of the ninja pose once you're done running.

, Keep your weight back on one leg, in a balanced position. Move the other foot a small step forward, so its outer edge is barely pressing the ground in front of you.


The outer edge is the side of your foot closest to your little toe.

, ""Roll"" the foot inward, toward the inner edge next to your big toe. Rotate your knee inward with this motion as well.Shift your weight from your back foot forward to your front foot once it is flat.


If you notice a small rock or other obstacle underneath your foot, lift your foot and reposition it.

, Move your next foot forward a short distance and step in the same way, taking short strides so you can stay balanced at every point in the motion.


If you want to minimize your footprints, you can place one foot directly in front of the other, in a straight line., There's nothing more ninja than navigating through a pitch dark area. Move extra slowly in dark areas, including motions of your arms and head. If you're next to a wall, brush it lightly with your fingertips to keep yourself moving in a straight line. Hold your other hand in front of you at waist level, to detect obstacles., When sneaking on a carpet or other soft surface, lift your foot and place it down in one go, instead of rolling. Even small sideways motions can rustle the carpet fibers, making this more difficult than walking on a hard surface."
"
Practise, practise, practise.,
Don't focus on both blades.,
Understand that a saberstaff is no better than a regular lightsaber.,
Practise spinning your saberstaff with both hands.,
Although you can't attack with both blades at once, you can defend with both.",How to Learn the Basics of Jar'kai2," Saberstaffs are harder to master than dual blades. Most of the moves of the main forms you will have to adapt, or you'll end up slicing yourself in half with your second blade. Take up quarterstaff training to help., This is a mistake that many people make. With a saberstaff, the blades form a straight line. Therefore, if you know the location of one of the blades, you should be able to infer the position of the other., In fact, a regular lightsaber may be better. If you're attacking somebody in front of you with a saberstaff, the second blade is pointing behind you, so you can't attack with two blades at once. Saberstaffs are far more unwieldy indoors than a regular lightsaber. Most of their value comes from the fact that, as they are very rare, it can be quite shocking to suddenly find yourself facing one., Because a saberstaff is longer and heavier than a regular lightsaber, it has a higher ""moment of inertia"". Basically, you have to apply more force to make it spin at the same speed. Use both hands at the centre of the handle., Saberstaffs are much better than regular sabers for defence, as there is more blade to defend with. Try practising Soresu or Niman as one of your main forms."
"
Understand what is meant by paired blades.,
Practise with just one lightsaber.,
Practise with your sabers in both dual blade and saberstaff modes.,
Learn when to change modes.",How to Learn the Basics of Jar'kai3," Paired blades are like the ones Asajj Ventress wields: dual blades that can be attatched and detached to form a saberstaff., Use the main forms. This is important because, if you detach your lightsabers, and then lose one, you only have one blade left., Learn which is best for each situation., If you change modes partway through a battle, it can surprise your opponent. This can work out to your advantage."

, If you can't find one near you, don't have the money, or are a kid and don't want to ask your parents, find a website to assist you with locating a suitable school.


Your first and best shot is to find a teacher, (like Kakashi or Uruhara or a nice guy) or have a teacher find you. It matters not which one you choose, but keep in mind that each choice requires something different. It is recommended that you try ninjutsu or taijutsu first.
Some suggest joining a martial arts class to start (after you have a hold on things, you can move on).

, This is the art of moving freely and efficiently through your environment.

, See whether people notice you.

, The ninja uniform may not be necessary, but at least get tabi, which are the split-toed ninja shoes. Also, get weapons. Shuriken are available online, but check your local laws first.

, Be proficient with a bunch. The more weapons you have experience with, the better your odds in a fight.

, You'll be giving them a weapon, and you'll lose yours.

, You're more likely to fight someone who has a knife than a bo staff these days.

, Note that after the class training, which will take a few years you can start working on your ""energy"". This is a favorite of Naruto fans.

, It's okay to tell people you're a ninja, but make it seem like a joke. Don't let people find out that you are an actual ninja.

, If you want, handpick a group of friends to train them. Start a group of ninjas.

, You can't be a ninja unless you are emotionally ready to be one, that's because being a ninja/shinobi is not a game. Being a ninja means you now carry the responsibility of protecting someone, something, or somewhere.

Stand with both feet planted shoulder width apart, knees bent a little less than 45 degrees.,
Pick a hand — perhaps the one you poured with.,
That's it!",How to Throw a Punch2," There are some things that you'll need to know, or you may get hurt.

, A 1 gallon (3.8 L) jug will do too.

, Make sure your knuckle is not jutting out, or in any way intentionally protruding. It's just tipped forward by the position that your hand is in.

, Make a fist with both hands and bring both fists, fingers (with thumb across them) facing up, elbows pointing straight out behind you. In Kenpo, this is a horse stance.

, Try this slowly a few times: bring your hand forward, rotating your fist until it has turned just past an upright position and drive with your top knuckle into the pitcher-holding position that you've hopefully tried and recognize. This time, though, you'll extend your arm fully.








, Now, you just have to do it quickly, timing the rotation and drive of your knuckles to correspond with the extension of your arm.









You'll also need to make sure you let yourself pull your arm back, loosely flexing your elbow at the end of the punch when you do it quickly. Otherwise, you may hurt your elbow (or worse) if you punch too hard, and without restraint.
Remember, if there's no one to absorb your blow when fully outstretched, your elbow will have to take the full force. Retracting at the end lets your muscles take the load.

, Shift your weight to your back foot. Twisting your hips generates power and makes your punch more devastating.








, The arm throwing the punch should be bent, not straight. There are a couple different variations to this punch:









The European hook: your thumb, if it were to be extended, should point in at you as your hook connects. You don't want to actually extend your thumb out as you punch; keep it in a fist. This is a good hook if there is a very short distance between you and your opponent.
The American hook: your thumb, if it were to be extended, should point up as your hook connects. Again, don't extend your thumb. This is a good hook if there is a lot of distance between you and your opponent.
The Mexican hook: the punch is thrown at a 45 degree angle instead of a completely horizontal angle. This is a blend of a hook and an uppercut.

, When you throw your hook, pop your elbow up as a defense mechanism.

, A lot of people who try to throw an uppercut bring their arm back like they are trying to throw a bowling ball; this is incorrect form. Don't bring your hand back very far at all.









Don't bring your hand low, either. Your leading hand should be no lower than your lower chest.

, If done properly, the uppercut should stun your opponent and cause him to lose his balance temporarily, leaving you time to punch again.

Be aware of the consequences of this move.",How to Strike by Elbow (Palkup Chigi) or Knee (Mureup Chigi) in Taekwondo1," It can deliver a strike to the head, the back, the face, the checks, and the groin. These strikes can be painful and damaging enough to end a fight without much effort. Chigi of Palkup (elbow) and Mureup Chigi (knee), can be a very potent technique when executed with precision; it is particularly useful for women defending themselves at close range. As such, it is recommended that all girls and women learn how to master this kind of technique to use for close-range self-defense.


In Taekwondo, elbow strikes or knee strikes are most often used while in close range, but are also employed while jumping toward the opponent. The hardness of the elbow allows for hitting with considerable force, and experienced fighters can easily knock out, cut, or injure their opponent with a well-placed strike.






Elbow or knee strikes are generally most effective when used in combination with punches or kicks, to allow the fighter to close the distance, especially when women are being harassed close up.

To improve your guard it is important to not only work directly on your guard game, but also focus on your guard passing and defense abilities.,
Your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guard game will vary from person to person.,
Being flexible in this Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guard position will open up many possibilities for you.,
By moving your hips to different positions in your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guard, you will open up new opportunities giving you different and more efficient angles and enabling you to respond when the opening is there.,
It is important while cultivating your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guard game that you play with many different partners this will get you used to dealing with different sizes, styles and skill levels.",How to Improve Your Guard in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu," This will give you the opportunity to see firsthand the things your opponent will be working on you while in your guard. One good strategy while developing your Jiu Jitsu guard is to learn how to reverse the situation by using what your opponent needs to pass your guard and changing the position so he has to follow you. This will enable you to lead your opponent into submissions and sweeps or at least make it very difficult for him to pass. You need to analyze what tools you are best at pulling off, what grips work good and where your position and body weight should be. This will help you to see the openings your opponent will be looking for and close the gaps or change the position before he is successful.;
, Some people are very flexible and will have very different strategy than someone who is slow or has long legs versus short legs. All of these things will play a factor in the kind of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guard game you will develop. Learn the position, understand the basic strategy and adjust to it with your physical capabilities. Practicing and drilling the position over and over will help you begin to move naturally in the guard. This is important with any martial art. You need to have it in your muscle memory and be able to respond, not think first then react. This is already too late.

, If you are a smaller athlete learning the game, work hard on your flexibility it is important for you to be solid in the position. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has many different strategies to explore when developing your guard game: open guard, closed guard, butterfly guard, half guard, spider guard, rubber guard and the combinations go on. A tall person with long legs may prefer to work from the closed guard where it is easy for him to lock his legs around the opponent where a short person may prefer the open guard where they will focus on developing there hip movement and setting up angles of attack. The open guard is also good for someone who moves fast making it easier to change angles setting up sweeps, submissions and giving him the opportunity to reverse the situation quickly.

, A smart opponent will try to pin your hips not giving you the opportunity to move making it easier for him to pass your guard and reducing your options for submissions or sweeps. If your opponent is good at controlling your hips you will also have a difficult time using your legs to defend against his pass attempts.

, If you get to the point where your training partner is easily submitted you can give yourself a challenge by only trying to work a few areas you are struggling with or letting him get a step ahead and trying to move back to the advantageous position. If you get stuck and are having a difficult time making things come together ask your instructor what your next step should be or what strategy will work best for you. A basic rule to play by is you need to do the technique three to four thousand times to pull it off under pressure, so don’t get frustrated if you have only done the move fifty or a hundred times. Remember, you can become successful if you put in the time. This will lead to many years of good Brazilian jiu jitsu training.

Allow the force to pull your upper body forward while maintaining balance.,
You've done it!

",How to Jump from Back on Legs," This step is seemingly the most simple, but you have to assure that there is nothing to hit your head on. Concussions are not exactly a fun things to have. Make sure that you have ample space to jump up and that there are no slippery rugs beneath you, as they could cause an unsafe slip and fall.;
, This may seem silly and superfluous, but it will cause the adequate swing factor that will be later learned.

, Do this lightly because you don't want to rely on your hands, but on your stomach and feet. For individuals with weaker stomachs, you can use your hands to avoid your head crashing into the earth while practicing. Practiced professionals need not use their hands and can use only their legs, but most readers are learning and not already trained.

, Here comes the tricky part. This move takes a great deal of practice to master and can be quite difficult if correct force and velocity are not achieved. At this step, there is an extremely important element, flexibility. From afar it appears that the legs and stomach are doing all the work, but the important aspect is the back. While in the motion of swinging your legs to the floor, you should feel your back start to bend as if you are doing a back bend usually seen in gymnastics. As seen in this hyperlink- http://www.vancouveryoga.com/assets/photos/backbend_fiona.jpg

, You should feel a smooth wavelike bend from your bottom to your neck. All of this should be achieved while your body is vertical to the ground with only your feet touching the ground. There should still be force that starts to swing your upper body forward.

, Without balance your bottom will end up slamming on the floor and bruises may develop. When you feel balanced, stand up.

Always maintain an awareness of your surroundings.,
If you feel that you are in serious danger, leave as soon as possible.,
Try to defuse the situation.,
If escape is not possible or viable, get into fighting stance.,
From this ""fence,"" continue to use passifying dialogue.,
Watch for the adrenal response in your aggressor.,
Make noises while you fight.,
Maintain the distance with your fence.,
Be very careful when you hit someone in the face.,
If the opponent is bigger and more skilled than you are, make it an extra effort not to get hit.,
Know how to take a hit.,
Aim your reactive strikes at the chin or jaw.,
If he falls over, kick or stomp at his legs and torso.,
Escape once the assailant is down and vanquished.",How to Win a Fist Fight," Know who is capable of assaulting you and how to exit the area quickly. This will help you see violence before it happens, and give you time to prepare a response should you need one. It will also make any adrenaline work in your favor, rather than causing you to freeze.


Keep your periphery active while your eyes move around. Your periphery is the outer boundary of your vision, the stuff you indirectly see when staring at things. Keep this periphery active. It'll help you anticipate obstacles while you still have time.;
, If you believe that a person or party is intent on attack by the time you decide to exit, attempt to do so without causing them alarm. Attackers are more likely to rush you if they think you are actively fleeing.


Swallow your pride — mild altercations can quickly escalate into serious harm because both parties could not control their egos or did not know their limitations. Going to the hospital with a broken nose might not be worth the ""cred"" that you get for staying in a losing battle.

, This is the negotiation phase of the fight. Talk to your assailant and try to get him to step down or see the value of making truce. If you've got the gift of gab, here's where you can use it. Keep your guard up while you negotiate.


Say something like: ""I'll fight you, but I'd honestly rather not. Let's just calm down and try to fix this like adults.""

Or try something like: ""I really don't want to hurt you. I have nothing to prove. You can try hitting me if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it.""


, Raise your hands up, palms out, at neck level, and angle your body away from the aggressor. This accomplishes three things: it controls the vital distance between you and the aggressor (acting as a ""fence""), it covers your head and vital organs, and appears non-aggressive. Always stay moving somewhat, but never backwards.


Protect your face with your hands. Look at a picture of a boxer whose gloves are covering his face; this is where you want your hands, unless you are delivering a punch.
Keep your legs spread apart and your knees slightly bent. This will give you more balance. You don't want your assailant to be able to knock you over.
When you're not talking, keep your mouth closed. A well-placed hit to an open mouth can break your jaw.

, (e.g. ""What's the problem? How can I help?"") The best way to win a fight is to not let it happen in the first place. ""Calm down buddy"" and ""Take it easy"" can increase tension.


Passifying dialogue has several positive effects:

It affords the aggressor non-violent options.
It may lower the aggressor's guard or cause them to underestimate you.
It establishes your position on the fight.
It illicits a choice on the behalf of the aggressor which will buy you time.



, When the adrenaline is really pumping in your assailant, the attack is most likely imminent. Most people will not back down from an attack once their adrenalin has surged, be prepared to be hit no matter what they seem to be doing.


Signs that your assailant's adrenal response is in full force:

Monosyllabic speech or grunting
Excessive swearing
Splaying of the arms
Furrowed eyebrows
Dropping the chin
Face goes white
Baring teeth



, It may sound strange, but it works. Deliver your fiercest war cry in a fit of fury. This serves two purposes. For one, you'll intimidate your assailant if your grunts are really fierce and violent; second, you'll draw more attention to the fight, making it easier to end it.

, To strike you, the aggressor must get past your fence. 95%+ of the time, they will attempt a strike to the head, usually with a right hook. (Most people are right-handed.) If you know that your assailant is left-handed, be on guard for a left hook to the face or body.


Use your fence as a tripwire. If your assailant touches it once, line up for a pre-emptive strike. Strike on the second touch, in a place where they are vulnerable.
Do not wait for your opponent to correct themselves or escalate their attempts. If they even touch you once, brace yourself for counterattack the next time they attempt contact.

, You could very easily break the small bones in your hands, or even collapse your knuckles. Aim for their nose and lips to minimize that risk.

, If they are strong, chances are they can also punch very hard. It can take just one well-placed punch to take someone out.


Dodging is the key. Stay on your toes and dance around like a boxer. If your assailant doesn't know in what direction you'll be going, he'll have a harder time punching you or getting you down on the ground.
After dodging a punch, they will be off guard for a split second. This is the time to hit them. Soft spots are extremely useful. The nose, face, kidneys, temples, and throat are all good places for a punch. This may temporarily incapacitate him (especially the throat, but it could collapse their windpipe). Kicks to the side of the femur are also effective. You can throw him off balance long enough to catch him in the jaw with a punch or kick.

, Unless you fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee, you'll probably be hit at least one or two times during the fight. Knowing how to take a hit will help you last longer and be able to take harder hits.


How to take a hit in the face. Keep your mouth closed, clench your neck and jaw muscle, and move toward the punch. Moving toward the punch (unless it's a straight-on punch) could cause the assailant to mishit, giving you an opportunity to strike back. If you can, try to get your assailant to aim for your hard forehead, which will hurt his hands.
How to take a hit to the body. Tighten your stomach muscles without sucking in lots of air. Try to move around the punch so that it hits you on the sides (obliques) rather than dead on in the stomach or against any organs.

, Fist and hand techniques are the most viable option. Look at the jaw before you strike it. This not only gives you the chance to disable your opponent, but even a strong failed attempt can force an attacker to reconsider further efforts.


If he's leaving his stomach unguarded, try to go for a gut punch in order to knock the wind out of him. If you succeed in knocking the wind out of him, the fight is effectively done.

, A knee drop to the chest is also very effective, but realize that it places you in close proximity to any attacks of theirs. Do not kick to the head, as it is easily fatal.

, If your punching technique is strong enough and you have mentally disarmed the attacker via your dialogue and ""fence,"" he will be knocked out or at very least disorientated. Use this time to escape if you can. If your strike did not have this effect, he will still be caught off-guard. Continue forcing him back with strikes to the chin, jaw and neck, until they are unable or unwilling to fight.

Stay connected to the center.,
Yield to overcome.,
Look where you are going.,
Balance timing and concentration.,
Keep your feet connected to the ground.",How to Internalize Deeper Basics of Aikido," According to Tao Te Ching, ""Stay in the center of the circle and let everything fall into place."" Aikido instructors constantly emphasize using your physical center (your hips and abdomen area) as the source of power for doing the technique.When you are truly connected to the physical center, you have immense power at your disposal, far more than what your hands and shoulders alone can provide. In the same way when you are connected to your being(universal intelligence) you have immense spiritual power at your disposal. Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.

This is one of the main reasons why you may often hear from Aikido instructors to relax your shoulders and not use muscle.When your shoulders are relaxed, your hands are connected to your center.
Also, to keep your hands connected to your center and to have more power in your technique, keep your hands in front or your body or general center area; that's where your power lies. This is also why in most of the Aikido techniques uke, essentially, is in front of you.;
, According to deeper wisdom behind eastern martial arts, ""Don't resist the opponent; yield to overcome.""This is a physical manifestation of the spiritual saying, ""Don't resist.""

Most of the Aikido techniques are about yielding to the opponent(uke) and not fighting or resisting. According to Tao Te Ching ""When two great forces oppose each other, the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield."" That's why there is great strength in yielding or allowing what is.
This is why there is no conflict in almost all of the Aikido techniques. As a basic, Nage is simply feeling Uke's energy and leading them to wherever they are going.

, When you look where you are going, you are more efficiently able to redirect and lead opponents energy. Plus your technique has more power. Its like your motion is aligned with your vision. Hence, there's little or no conflict., According to Tao Te Ching ""Think of the small as large and the few as many. Confront the difficult while it is still easy"". Physical manifestation of this, in Aikido, is to take the Uke's balance during the initial phase of the attack. As longer Uke have their balance, more momentum they will gain in their attack and it would become more and more difficult to unbalance them. For example: when someone punches you, their power is lowest right at beginning of the motion of their fist. Then with time their fist gains momentum. So the best window to unbalance the attacker would be before their fist or attack reaches its full speed. That's why balance of time and concentration is essential in Aikido.

Aikido has techniques to calibrate and yield to the opponent when they have gained momentum. However, in essence, its about taking the balance. This guideline is more for practical purposes.

, When your feet are properly connected to the ground then it becomes easier to unbalance the uke. According to Tao Te Ching ""Whether you go up the ladder or down it, your position is shaky. When you stand with your two feet on the ground, you will always keep your balance."""

You need to be familiar with 5 Step Chi Kung breathing.,

At no time should you break skin!,
Replace the fine sand grains with coarse sand granules and repeat as before and continue your Push-up on three fingers.,

Now PUSH your hands through the sand until all 4 fingers are fully in the sand. Again practice this until you can do this 100 time, 50 with each hand in one practice sessions. Now start increasing the speed of your pushing, gradually until it is striking speed. Take this slowly as this is the make or break phase. You may also wish to supplement this with 100 Push-ups first on your fist then on three middle fingers of each hand.

, Always stop if your hand is damaged and start from the beginning all over again!

Train regularly and well.,
Make weight as smoothly as possible.,
Keep a good stance.,
Know your advantages and be prepared to use them.,
Study your opponent's previous fights.,
Know the advantages of different attacks and targets.,
If your opponent gives you the slightest opening, take it.,
If you have someone shouting directions from your corner, listen to them.,
Mix it up.,
Never panic.,
After the fight, don't be a jerk.",How to Win an MMA Match," Although it might be obvious, it isn't obvious to every MMA amateur fighter. Some professionals train up to seven hours a day on their fighting skills, so it's fairly evident that self discipline and focus on daily training is an important part of getting anywhere near success in MMA. Just be aware that a failure to train consistently and with dedication will mark you as a likely loser from the start because you'll lack the requisite practice and exercise required.


At the very least, you need proficient skill in striking, clinching, and ground-fighting.






As well, learn about successfully transitioning (or resisting transitioning) between the three above skills. Train in everything, as striking or grappling alone is not enough. If there is an area you're weak in, your opponent will take advantage and defeat you easily.






Optimally, you should also work on conditioning your body as a whole. Increase your strength, speed, balance, coordination, and cardio.






Finally, work on increasing your tolerance for pain. This one may never be completely worked out but you can do your best to improve your tolerance.





;
, Most, if not all, of your fights will be in an organization that requires you to fight in a certain weight class (there are nine weight classes).Aim always to be as heavy as you can be, but still be in the weight class you want to fight at. Try to spread out your weight gain or loss over a long period of time because too much weight loss and you'll feel tired and disoriented in the fight, and too much weight gain and you'll have more fat than muscle, along with poor cardio.

, Ideally, your feet should be shoulder length apart and slightly bent. Your hands should be up in front of your face, your chin should be down, and your shoulders up, to protect you from knock-out. If your opponent attacks your body, block with your elbows. Ignore the temptation to use your forearms because you need those up to protect your head.

, If your opponent is weaker in ground fighting, take the fight to the ground. If you have a reach advantage, use your kicks to keep your opponent off you as much as possible. If your opponent has the reach advantage, get in close to nullify it.

, Look what he or she likes to do. Is your opponent like Mirko Cro Cop, who is a striker and hates being on the ground, even when he's on top? Or is your opponent a Brock Lesnar, where it's just takedown and beat up? If your opponent tries to fake intents, don't fall for it. You've seen what your opponent likes to do, and you aren't going to let him or her pull it off.

, Hitting the legs can slow your opponent down, and if your opponent can't put weight on them, s/he can't push off the ground and hit you with as much power.


Hitting the torso can put strain on the lungs, making your opponent tired.






In addition, a powerful enough strike to the stomach or kidneys can seriously injure your opponent, forcing your opponent out of the fight (though this doesn't happen often).






Attacking your opponent's head hurts a lot (there are a lot of nerve endings in your face, so it's more sensitive than other areas), and it has the potentiality for a knockout.






In addition, punches are a lot faster and more accurate than kicks, but kicks have more power and longer reach. Kicks are ideal for attacking the legs and punches are better for attacking the head, with the torso in the middle for both.







, If you manage to grab your opponent's wrist, then you can pull him or her forward, kick the back of his or her knee, and choke 'em out. If s/he has his or her hands down, go for the head.


If s/he has his or her hands across his/her face too closely, this might hurt their vision, so go low (like leg kicks and knee kicks, if the organization allows it).







, They can see the fight from an angle you can't, and they're probably a lot calmer than you, so they'll have a much better idea of what to do than you will.

, Don't use one technique over and over. If there is a technique working really well against another opponent, use it, but throw others in there as well. Become too predictable and your opponent will soon have the advantage.

, No matter what situation you're in, there's always a way to win, even if your opponent has you in a rear-naked choke, arguably the best submission in existence. You can always escape, counter, or at least survive, but you have to stay calm.

, Congratulate your opponent and tell him or her it was a great fight, whether you lose or win, and be as sincere as possible. Acting like a jerk stems from pride, and pride can cloud your vision, make you underestimate your opponent, and generally be your downfall. Look at Michael Bisping. He is a great, skilled fighter, and he deserves all the praise he gets. But, he let it go to his head, got full of himself, acted like a jerk to Dan Henderson, and got knocked out by Dan Henderson in their fight. Even if you're as anti-tradition as a martial artist can get, the traditionalists know what they're talking about when they say, ""A martial artist must always be humble"".

"
"
Never start the fight.,
If it is a standoff between your attacker and you, do not hesitate to go on the offensive.,
Leave the area.,
Push away and start saying a random phrase.,
While your hand is currently occupied by strangling the piss out of your opponent, take your weaker hand, and shove your thumb into their eyeballs.,
This will completely incapacitate your first attacker, leaving you time to flee the scene.,
Do not find a weapon, if you do not plan on using it violently and to severely injure your attacker.,
It's a lot better to hurt the opponent if you need to defend yourself.,
But one thing that works among all things is boxing out their ears.",How to Win a Fist Fight (Full Proof Version)," Words do hurt, so be careful what you say. And if someone speaks to you in a nasty manner, ignore them or engage them in conversation.;
, If there are multiple attackers, calmly ask them to back off and that you do not want to fight. (It's much better to go home penniless than injured). If that doesn't work, and they want a fight, strike first. Do not let them punch you before doing anything.

, If you are facing up against two or more opponents, attempt to leave the area fast. Walk briskly away to any place where people are. If they try to stop you by touching you in any way. Then it's GO TIME.

, They'll say ""what?"" or start laughing with their friends. Before they can do anything else. Take your dominant hand and make a stiff C with it. Flex your arm and fingers, and hit them in the neck as hard as you possibly can. Squeeze their Adam's apple if possible. Their first reaction will be to try to get your hand off. The person you have first attacked will be in complete and utter shock at what you just did. No 360 spin kick or submission hold will stop you. If you don't believe me, go ask a family member or friend to grab your windpipe and squeeze. What's your first reaction? Painful, wasn't it?

, (Don't be a wuss, who cares if it's gross or you get a little slimy.)

, Run if possible. They may not continue to assault you if they know what you are capable of. If they do, get to a police station or run into any area with lighting and lots of cars or people. My suggestion would be cars: kick and hit as many cars as you can without hurting yourself, some may have car alarms. Which does what? Right... it makes people alerted and go see what's happening. Yell and scream the whole way there.

, Do not pick it up; they may pick it up and use it on you.

, Do not listen to the pacifist idiots that say avoid injuring the person at all costs. If they touch you, they obviously mean harm to you. So return the favor. Let them know that they just made the biggest mistake of their lives.

, This brutal slap will damage their equilibrium making them disoriented allowing you to run or finish them off. If you don't know how to all you have to do is cup your hands and slap their ears at the same time. You'll be amazed at what their reaction will be to that."
"
Put your palms together in front of you as if you were praying.,
Crouch down on one knee with your palms still pushing against each other.

,
This is the main thrusting and spinning motion of the strike, which is the most difficult to perfect.,
Complementing this with a spin makes it even more effective.,
Combine this spin with the thrusting motion previously described.",How to Perform a Spinning Spear Punch," Squeeze your palms tightly together in front of your chest. Your arms should be quivering a bit as you are pushing your palms together.;
,, As you use your leg muscles to leap forward, quickly straighten your arms, using the pent-up force from pushing your palms together to your advantage. This should propel you forward, with the forward momentum of your movement and your arms concentrated in the spear-like tips of your fingers.

, Practice an individual horizontal roll. From a crouching position, shift your body weight clockwise, flipping onto your back and completing the spin by reasserting your original position coming up from the left. Practice this, and do it faster and faster.

, Aim for the opponent's groin or solar plexus. The thrust itself is the force equivalent of a sledgehammer to the groin or chest. Combined with a spin, this concentrates the surface of contact onto the rotating tips of your fingers, drilling your opponent and sending him to the ground hard.

"
"
Make a fist and hold it up like you were holding a cup with one hand.,
Use a technique called Coiling, which makes your body loose and you need to use POI (Point of Impact), which means you are relaxed and stumbling, but at the moment you strike, you tense up and rocket your body forward using the strength from your feet through the body to the part of your body striking the opponent.,
Another technique you should learn is called Staggering.,
Do not attack with rhythm; Attack at unusual times such as when you are falling back, staggering to the side, etc.

",How to Use Drunken Fist1," Extend your index finger into a hook shape, and position your thumb so that your index and thumb make a ""C"";
, A good way to do this is to imagine a spring in your body, a spring is very flexible but maintains its shape, a spring often wobbles/bounces round. Put these kind of movements in to your body and you will find it easier to understand.

, This will confuse the enemy and leave you an opening to strike. You can also use this for gathering momentum in your hits.

If you know how to use any of the Drunken God Styles then that will be of use.,
Drunken God with internal strength uses a lot of ""coiling"" which makes your opponent confused.,
Drunken God with the sudden waist attack involves incredible stamina.,
Drunkard with the powerful throat lock is very deadly.,
Drunken God with the double kicks is a great style for keeping your opponent at a distance.,
Drunken God with crippled leg uses the legs the most and only uses one leg at a time(one leg always being straight).,
Drunken God holding large keg is a very effective style as it uses large fast circular movements to attack.,
Drunken God with long flute is a common favorite because it is the style with the strongest wrist.,
Drunken Goddess Mrs. Ho is unusual and awkward feeling to the user and the target alike which makes it deadly.,
Also there are other family styles of drunken fist.",How to Use Drunken Fist2," Some of the gods to use are, Drunken God with internal strength, The drunkard with the sudden waist attack, the Drunken God with the powerful throat lock, Drunken God with the double kicks, Drunken God holding large keg, Drunken God with long flute, and Drunken Goddess Mrs. Ho ""flaunting her body"". All these techniques are effective in their own way and it always matters upon the situation.

, Using this style inquires you to stumble a lot. Remember, while using this style, you must have one leg tense, (not all the time). Combining the coiling, stumbling, and the use of the tense leg, you can develop many great openings, which gives a right moment to strike.

, Why? Because there's never a moment when you rest. While using this style, you must always be aware of what you're hitting, where you're hitting, and hitting your opponent frequently. This drunkard style always hits his opponent in a small circle in front of the user. This style is considered very popular, since it involves using a lot of movement, a lot of hitting, and a lot of circular attacks. It is very effective, but also very tiring. So this style could be considered, as one of your last options.

, Just by it's name, it represents using throat locks. While using this style, you must have very powerful wrists and fingers. This style is very powerful, and great for defense, However, this style involves doing forward flips with your hands behind you (on your back) and flipping forward, but without jumping (like a slinky). Using this style inquires a lot of finger use. Therefore, your fingers must be incredibly strong.

, Like it's name, using double kicks keeps your opponent confused, (if he moves back) and if he doesn't move back, then it basically damages your opponent. This drunkard style has many Ariel kicks involved, so in order to make good use of this style, you must have strong legs, and a great base. Which means a neutral stance before attacking. It also inquires of extensive use of flexibility and balance. Balance is very important while using this style. If you lack balance, strong legs and a strong base, than this style will be hard for you.

, With this style it is important to use this as a last resort since this has many openings.

, This is one of the most effective styles in Drunken Fist styles. It is important to keep your arms in a circle in front of you during this.

, Its attacks are the most powerful and use the most stumbling.

, The moves may seem feminine, but they are very powerful since they use moves that resemble a woman fighting. Since people are often confused or think less of this style, it is more effective.

, one such style is Ba Ying Quan (Eight Shadow Fist) this style uses a different system but has similarities to the drunken god forms.

Choose an art form.,
Get the necessary equipment.,
Pick up books.,
Find a sensei (teacher).,
Train.,
Acquire real (or at least better) weapons.",How to Use a Katana Properly," Because everyone has different traits in combat, you must find an art form that you would be proficient in. If you are unfamiliar with Japanese martial arts, here are some common ones:


Kenjutsu: Training with the katana and other weapons (depends on school) for use in combat.
Iaijutsu/battojutsu intended for combat. Used to dispatch your opponent during or immediately after the draw of the sword.
Kendo: Art of Japanese fencing. Fought with shinai using armor.
Iaido/battodo: Art of drawing the sword.






Almost every art form will have different styles. Again, find the one that suits you best.;
, The equipment may differ depending on the art. Common weapons are:


Shinai: Bamboo swords for kendo comprised of bamboo strapped together. Used in kenjutsu where a bokken would be too dangerous or in kendo.
Bokken: Wooden practice swords closely resembling a katana or wakizashi. Safe alternative to a live sword. It's the most used weapon in kenjutsu.
Tanto: Japanese dagger about 0.5 feet (0.2 m) to 1 foot (0.3 m) in length.
Wakizashi: a short sword about 1.5 feet (0.5 m) to 2 feet (0.6 m) in length.
Katana: A sword about 3.5 feet (1.1 m) in length.
Ninjato: A cousin of the katana but with a straight blade.
Nodachi/Odachi: A really long katana that ranges from 34–60 inches (86.4–152.4 cm) long!







, After you have found an art form you are interested in and have gathered the necessary equipment, pick up books on the subject and do some research. The books should only be used IN CONJUNCTION with a qualified teacher! Trying to self learn techniques is highly discouraged, as doing so may corrupt your foundations.

, There is no way you can learn well without guidance. Find a dojo or school to learn your desired art.

, Practice assigned kata, or routines, until you can execute it fluently and effectively. If necessary, get a partner to train with you. Then, if permitted, move on to others. Don't forget the old ones.

, After you feel confident, acquire better (which usually means more dangerous) weapons.


Choosing a katana:






Choosing a katana is mostly a matter of preference: some prefer heavier katana, while others like lighter; same goes for length. Ask a senior member of your class or your sensei where to purchase your katana from.
Use the Internet and study up on the different parts of the katana and how a katana is made, and you will be able to tell the difference between the quality of different katanas.
Choose a suitable kissaki (tip) for the blade. Different arts require different kissaki sizes. Find out which one your art form requires. Common kissaki types are o-kissaki, chu-kissaki and Kk-kissaki, which are large, medium and small, respectively. It is usually possible to determine the kissaki size by just glancing at the blade. Turn the tip up, and look at the sword from the side. Note how the blade narrows at the end, and forms an angle with the relatively straight blunt side of the sword. If the angle is more than 45 degrees, it is usually an o-kissaki. If the angle is around 45 degrees, it is a chu-kissaki. One can conjecture what a ko-kissaki is like.
Choose a suitable sori (curvature). The requirements for curvature of the blade differs from form to form. The sori pattern not only differs in the degree of curvature, but the also where the deepest part of the curve is located in relation to the tsuka (hilt) or kissaki.
Choose a design. By design, I mean the aesthetics of the sword. Believe it or not, the aesthetics of a weapon affects your use of it. Choose a sword that interests your tastes, but not so much that you are overprotective of it. Choosing an unappealing sword could potentially lead to disinterest in your weapon.
The only thing a person should be cutting with a katana in this day and age are items used for tameshigiri (test cutting). The techniques for this will be taught to you if you take kenjutsu and iaijutsu but to my knowledge are not taught in kendo.

Here is an example of a similar series of techniques where the defender is unarmed and the attacker is armed with a knife.

",How to Use a Knife in a Combative Situation,", The imperatives are simply 5 basic and fundamental principles that should always be adhered to in an engagement with an edged weapon. The five principles are as follows:


Expect to get cut.
Defang the serpent.
Control
Time is of the essence.
Survival. Survival is the most important imperative.

, Stance is very important in knife combat; your stance is the foundation of which you are able to maneuver and engage. The forward fighting stance is a great stance for maneuvering. The weight should be more even between feet. The weight should be rested on the balls of the foot. The front knee is slightly bent and the elbows are in at the sides. and the hands are up for protection. The lead hand or ""Checking hand is always in front. The checking hand is the hand that assists the cutting hand in combat by controlling the enemy's weapon hand, and or setting up an attack. The chin is tucked in as to protect the throat. Remember that this stance is a mobile stance. In knife combat mobility is important. Never pass up the opportunity for escape!

, Entering is nothing more than closing the distance between you and the weapon or you and the enemy. Stepping in is key in entering. often times instructors tell their trainees to sidestep and block. In this method of instruction we will do away with this idea of blocking and side stepping. The main point of entering is to close the distance and terminate the engagement quickly, not to narrowly evade and then re counter. Therefore stepping deeply and directly in is imperative. Remember, that the knife is simply an extension of the empty hand.

,,, The term blocking often refers to deflection by pushing away. That is why we will not use the term block, but cover. Covering in this case the higher and lower gate is executed by taking the checking hand and covering across your upper gate with your palm facing out. The checking hand moves across the body in an arching motion and stops past the ear of the non checking side. The knife hand covers the lower gate, in an arching motion across the legs and groin. Once the lower gate hand reaches the opposite hip it continues the circle upwards till it is directly in front of your face. The act of stepping in and simultaneously covering is essential in setting your enemy up for the next technique in the series.

, Feed the attackers weapon hand by using both your knife and checking hand (preparing to attack the wrist tendons).



Attack the weapon hand







Attack the arm







Destroy the arm and puncture the artery






Now that you have successfully closed the distance and covered, you can now focus on defanging the serpent. The knife is an extension of the empty hand, and the knife wielding arm itself can be likened to a snake or serpent. Snakes have fangs that bite and often times are deadly. If you defang the serpent it can not penetrate your flesh with its fangs, and therefore the advantage is taken from the enemy. Stepping and covering is a very important part of defanging the serpent, but you must also know how to control the weapon and how to attack the weapon hand / arm in order to make the attacker release the weapon.
Where to attack the weapon arm: Joints ( Tendons and Ligaments)I.E. Above the elbow and the wrist. If the attacker can not physically hold the weapon; or utilize his arm because his tendons and ligaments have been slashed and render his weapon arm useless, he can not do much to cause harm with the weapon.
Veins and arteries If you begin to slash into his veins and arteries located on the inner portion of his arm, he will begin to lose large amounts of blood. Losing large quantities of blood is demoralizing as well as it can make one pass out quickly and move them one step closer to expiration. The brachial artery on the inside of the Biceps and the axillary artery in the armpit are excellent targets to cause rapid blood loss and death.
Just because you have defanged the serpent and are in control does not mean you are home safe. You must maintain control. Remember this attacker had a knife! If he had a knife that means he is bent on killing you. You must neutralize the situation by preventing him from any other further attacks. If you control the head the body will follow. In order to keep control you must be deep inside the grappling zone. Once you gain control of the attackers head by thrusting your blade into the hollow cavity below the jaw, take him to the ground. Do not lose control of the arm!


Thrust







,,,,, Whenever given the opportunity, it is recommended to escape, however there are some situations here that may not be possible. For instruction sake we will cover finishing the enemy. This technique may be useful for soldiers in combat. For example a detainee or prisoner of war who may have to engage the enemy in order for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape. The soldier has just engaged an enemy sentry and can not allow him to survive. This is not recommended for a street encounter however, it is important to mention that this guy just intended on killing you with a knife,and he may have friends nearby waiting to attack you. You may be able to justify this next course of action legally if you are convincing that you were in fear of your life and there was a possibility of further danger after neutralizing the first attacker.

Three critical areas in which to focus your training are cardiovascular fitness, core strength, and muscle mass:


Do cardio. This is the lifeblood of fight conditioning: fighters need to not only have excellent endurance, but also be able to summon a quick burst of power at a key moment in a fight. Fatigued fighters, on the other hand, tend to drop their arms, leave their critical hit points exposed, and fail to maintain a strong attack during the later rounds of a fight. To simulate the physical demands of fighting, do interval training; this has been shown to be an especially fast and effective way to condition your heart.Do core exercises. A fighter generates much of his or her power from the core, which helps the entire body move and work cohesively. Try performing exercises that involve many muscle groups such as chin-ups, crunches, squats, pull-ups, and thrusts.

Lift weights. Weightlifting helps fighters build muscle and strength to improve their attack power. The chest, shoulders and arms are of particular importance to upper-body-oriented fighting styles such as boxing; do flat bench presses, dumbbell military presses, lateral raises, bicep curls, and tricep kickbacks for chest, shoulder, and arm strength. Other fight styles such as MMA will require more balance between upper- and lower-body workouts; do squat-thrusts, hamstring curls, single-leg squats, step-ups, barbell deadlifts, and barbell squats for calf, thigh, and glute strength.;
, In addition to watching your intake of vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and water to combat workout fatigue and the buildup of metabolic waste, emphasize healthy proteins to build bulk.

, Start with a basic punch, making sure to practice with both the dominant and weak hand. Once you master the basic punching technique, try more advanced methods such as:



Jabbing: The jab is a short punch that’s is usually done with the weaker hand and helps keep your opponent away from you. To maximize the effectiveness of the jab, professional boxers twist their arm and wrist just before making contact with their opponent.

Cross-punching: As opposed to a jab, which is thrown straight in front of the body, cross-punching is powered by the shoulder and delivered by the strong hand in a slightly upward motion across the body.

Hooking: The hook can be delivered to the head or body of the opponent – whichever is unprotected – and is often used in combination with other punches. Its chief drawback is that it will leave you susceptible to a counterpunch.

Uppercutting: The uppercut is an upward blow unleashed by either hand and is especially effective in close quarters.

, Just like in chess, individual fighting moves are useless on their own; performed in a calculated sequence, however, they can take an opponent out. Learn how to not only combine moves from your chosen field of discipline, but also how to counter such combinations. In boxing, the most basic combination is a jab followed by a cross. Another effective combo adds a hook. (If you're right-handed, this would be a left jab followed by a right cross and ending with a left hook.)

, This will make your nerves less sensitive. Note that some fighting styles (ex. many traditional martial arts) encourage whole-body sensitivity and would never recommend nerve-desensitization.

, Slapping your opponent’s punches away from you, which is known as parrying, is the simplest way of blocking a punch. In boxing, more advanced techniques include:



Slipping: If your rival aims a punch at your head, sharply rotate your hips and shoulders.

Bobbing and weaving: If your rival aims a high blow (ex. a hook to the head), bend your legs (bob) and then arch the body just out of range (weave).

, If you are boxing, try blocking, which is done by absorbing impact with your gloves rather than your body.

, This will help you prepare for real world fights, work on your reflex speed, develop hand-eye coordination, and get in the right headspace. Make sure to practice against someone who is better than you; nothing is gained except through challenge.

, We often wonder how professional athletes with extensive training and years of experience can lose so badly during game time. The answer is simply that competition is as much about physical as mental training. To get in the right headspace, train until your body knows the moves so well that your mind can focus on your opponent; listen to music that pumps you up while you practice; learn to reinterpret pain as a step on the path to victory; visualize yourself fighting, defending, and winning; most importantly, learn to love to fight.

It is important to have a good fighting stance, but remember that a fighting stance is meant to improve your fighting and not destroy it.
Far too many martial art students are being corrupted when they are taught certain skills such as stances.
You need to realize that stances are meant to teach you the concepts behind standing a certain way. They are not supposed to be used in sparring exactly as they are taught to you! If you do this then you will look very mechanical and inhibit your ability to properly think, your mobility, your balance, your speed, and your techniques.
Remember this for your next sparring session because it will help you a lot.;
,


A little but important detail on your fighting stance is the concept of ""lead"".
This basically means which side you prefer to keep in the front.
It is normal for fighters to keep their strong side in the back because that is what they have been taught by their instructors, but before this should even be established you need to figure out the purpose of why you are learning to fight.
Is it for sports? For self-defense? For Street fighting?
Whatever the reason you need to know that the reason most instructors teaches their students to fight with their strong side in the back is either because that's how they were taught to fight or because they are teaching competitive sports martial arts.
By keeping the strong side in the back, fighters are able to maintain their upper body strength and energy for longer periods of time than if they were to put the strong side in the front.
BUT!
If you are learning martial arts in order to defend yourself or to become better at realistic street fighting, then you should be encouraged to put the strong side in the front.
And here is why:

The front hand/leg is closer to your opponent so it will get there faster.
If the front hand/leg gets to the target faster, why not put the strong side in the front?
On the street people fight bare knuckled! Meaning that fights don't last for minutes at a time.



,


Footwork is very important also! If you are still not able to move around with very little effort then you have a problem because having good footwork is key to being able to throw good techniques, maintaining correct distance to your opponent, and having a good defense.
Footwork can be improved through various agility drills, regular workouts, and by teaching yourself to use explosive movements.

,


Many beginning martial art students have problems with staying natural after they start learning all the techniques the instructor is teaching them. This is not bad for a beginning student since it is simply caused by the absence of training, but if a student has been practicing for a couple of years and is still showing very unnatural and mechanical movements then it becomes a problem.
This student HAS to be stripped of that bad habit!

,


It is obvious that in order to fight you will need to know the necessary techniques. Make sure that you know at least one technique for attacking straight and for attacking at an angle.
Here are a couple of examples of straight and angled attacks:

Straight:

(Punches)

Jab
Cross
Straight punch
Straight lead


(Kicks)

Straight kick
Front snap kick
Side kick





Angled:

(Punches)

Hook
Hammer fist
Back fist


(Kicks)

Roundhouse kick





,


Simple techniques are ALWAYS better because they are more likely to work in a fight. Know this!
The shortest distance is always the better solution which means that straight techniques usually works better. By keeping this in mind you will be able to get to your target a lot faster than if you were to use angled attacks.
This brings me to another issue regarding sparring matches which is the usage of complicated and advanced techniques...
When students are sparring it is very typical to see them throw various spinning kicks or punches, but if you have been sparring for a while you should at least know by now that spinning techniques are dangerous to use.
Yes they look very cool! But they will also force you to break eye contact with your opponent AND they take a lot longer to hit the target because of the traveling distance.

,


Every fighter has a fighting range where they are most comfortable fighting. It is important that you train this range in order to get the advantage when you are fighting. Footwork should be used in order to keep the opponent in the preferred range to give you the upper hand.
Also remember that it is important to train the other fighting ranges that you are worse at because it is very likely that you will be forced into other fighting ranges than the one you are comfortable with.

,


Have you ever been in a sparring match against someone who seems to know exactly what you are going to do before you even do it? This is because your opponent have learned to read body language.
Reading body language is an important skill that HAS to be learned!
It is learned through practice and experience so if you are wondering what type of training is required to learn it, it is sparring.
Don't worry there are also other ways to learn to read body language but they are not as effective as sparring... (Go to step 12 to figure out how)
Being able to read body language will make sparring A LOT easier because it will make the fight more comprehensive.

, (VERY IMPORTANT)


If you have reached the point in your training where you can't see yourself improve much further, it is time for you to start developing your own personal research. This research is the most important part of the ongoing training process that will help you create your own personal fighting method.
Researching is the only way for you to excel beyond the capabilities of your instructors! Isn't it logical that if you only learn what the instructor has to offer then you will only be able to reach the same skill level as your instructor...?
Remember! That the instructor is only there to guide you. It's up to YOU to improve beyond that point!
So how do you research....?

First you question everything you have learned!
Then you try out what you have learned in sparring to see if it really works by focusing on a single skill, technique or strategy at a time.
If a certain skill, technique or strategy doesn't work for you then you discard it!
If a certain skill, technique or strategy works for you then you keep it and try to improve it!
Then you start researching for alternative skills, techniques or strategies that you can add to your training!
Then you start the process all over again by questioning everything you have learned...


This way you will know exactly what works and what doesn't.
Remember that the only person who can tell you what works is you. We all have different strengths and weaknesses meaning that no one fights the same way.

,


After you have figured out which techniques works and which ones doesn't you will need to be able to put it all together in sparring. Try using as much of the above and try to make it part of your own fighting method.

,


Instinctive training is a type of training meant to help you be able to use what you have learned on instinct rather than trying to remember it all the time.
The reason this is important to learn is because if you have to spend to much time in a fight focusing on which techniques to use then you will get beaten.
Also if you were ever to get attacked on the street, the adrenaline in your body would only allow you to remember the techniques that are instinctive.
Some examples of instinctive training drills include having a training partner flash focus mitts at you or the partner punching at you while wearing gloves. This will teach your brain to react with a strike as soon as a target opens up or teach you to recognize punches thrown at you.
Instinctive training is basically meant as an introduction to sparring because it will allow a fighter to take it slower if he/she is still not comfortable with sparring.
It can also be used by experienced fighters to split the various skills required for sparring into segments in order to improve them individually.

,


Technical training is where you take the techniques you already know and work on each one of them in order to improve them even further.
There are many ways you could improve the techniques including:

Power

Muscle strength
Explosive movement
Kinetic linking
Punching through the target
Footwork
Hip/Shoulder rotation


Speed

Reaction speed
Initiation speed
Movement speed
Retraction speed
Snap motion
Non-telegraphing





,


It is always a good idea to be in good shape for a fight no matter what type of fight it is.
Conditioning will improve your overall stamina whether it being for a sports match or for running from a street fight...
Remember than when strength training it is better to improve the muscles in a way that enhances you striking ability, don't train just to achieve a higher muscle mass because this might make your punches/kicks slower.
Try using explosive movements when training since this will HIGHLY improve your initiation speed.

,


Your mindset towards fighting is the highest determining factor for if you will win or not!
If you walk into a fight and don't think that you will win then you won't win... You need to tell yourself that it doesn't matter if you win or not, as long as still manage to deal some damage on the opponent. Be careful though because if you fight while angry it will make you a worse fighter so don't fight angry, fight determined instead!

, If the attacker leads with the right leg you will do the foot jab with your right foot. (Remember this basic principle of kicking across - left foot to left shin or right foot to right shin).

, It does not have to be a snappy, crisp kick. A quick, strong push to the knee will do.

, With this push you may even dislocate it.

,, Kick the outside surface of the attacker's thigh approximately one hand width above the knee.

, Another way to learn the location of this spot is to stand upright and extend your arm along the side of your thigh. The spot will be at the top of your middle finger.

, This kick will paralyse  the attacker's leg and spin the attacker away from you. A powerful kick to that spot makes one feel like throwing up.

, The shield must be thick enough to protect your partner. Kick for maximum impact and follow through with enough power to spin or turn your partner.

, You can train the following:

Punching. Clench the fist properly, with the thumb outside, and strike with the first two knuckles. Ensure the wrist is kept straight and using as much force as you can stand, shout with every strike. Variants of punches can be used, such as the Leopard Punch or Phoenix Eye, but be careful with these because if improperly done, can lead to damage or injury.






Hammer-fist. Using the clenched fist, strike with the edge. Using as much force as you can stand, shout with every strike.






Back-fist. With the back of the fist, contact the bag with the first two knuckles. Again, use the most force that you can stand, and shout with every strike.

,,, If someone says the sword is carbon steel they probably don't know what they're saying, in this context (Steel always has carbon in it otherwise it would be iron). However, more generally, the term carbon steel is useful to distinguish non-stainless from stainless blades. A genuine ancient or functional Japanese blade would not be stainless, however. If it is stainless, it is almost certainly a modern reproduction designed to only be placed on a wall - it will have little value and will not hold an edge well, if at all.

, If the blade has been properly maintained or is recently created for use (some genuine modern blades do exist) then ensure the blade is sharper than any kitchen knife you've ever known. Be careful of cutting yourself!

,,, This is called a fuller in Western blade parlance, and it is generally accepted that it is used to lighten the blade, and make it more flexible, while not weakening it. Some other schools of thought suggest it exists so you could pull the sword out someones muscle and tissue which normally creates suction holding the blade in someones body (in which case it is referred to as a 'Blood Groove'). Rarely it may have been be used to cut out an impurity in the metal.

, The back of the blade and the adjacent sides should be shiny (there are katas which you use your katana to make sure no one is behind you by using the mirror-like surface of the sword), but the center and edge may be more matte (but still reasonably polished) and should have a wood-like 'grain' or water-like pattern (think ripples or waves). These patterns are unique to each blade (if genuine and not etched) and are a major part of a particular blade's beauty and personality. In ancient blades the pattern forms as a result of the layering and forging process, but in modern blades it may be 'fake' and a result of acid etching.

, Gendo for blades made from 1877-1945). As a rule of thumb the older it is the better quality it is likely to be, although the work of individual smiths is a major factor in this (ie. an ancient blade by a minor smith may not be the equal of a more recent blade by a famous master). In particular any blade made just prior to or since about WW2 has a higher probability being mass produced and/or inferior, though some reputable modern smiths do exist. On average these more recent blades would be worthwhile for training or souvenir purposes, but less so as a collectible.

, If investing serious money then before you do so, get a good book on valuing antique Japanese blades, look at as many as you can to get a sense of them (go to a museum), or (best of all) have the item assessed by a professional.


If the sword is of significant historical importance or value, and you have mucked it up by touching it bare-handed, understand that it costs up to $1,000 an inch to have it properly polished.

Not to mention there are far more resources to learn these arts., Once you know what you want to study, find resources and equipment to help you along the way. Checkout some books or watch videos online.


Invest in a heavy bag if you want to get the most out of training alone.There are a lot of schools that advertise online martial arts classes. While it's not the same as going to a school, you may still be able to learn more than if you trained alone.

, As a beginner martial artist start with the basics. Don't move straight into fancy kicks or acrobatics. Start with the building blocks of your chosen style.









Pay attention to your footwork as you practice. After every strike or combination, make sure you have a good stance.Imagine your opponent is standing in front of you. Practice striking, but practice keeping your guard up as well., The only way to excel at a martial art is to practice. While most people think of kung fu when they think of martial arts, the term ""kung fu"" has little to do with fighting. When translated, it means ""work hard.""








Aim for consistency in your practice. When punching your bag, for example, focus on hitting the same spot every time. Don't throw wild punches. Slow down and take your time with it. Your goal is accuracy first, then strength.Push yourself. As you progress in your training, practice longer. If you started out doing 50 kicks, try 100. Don't overdo it, though. Take care not to hurt yourself when training. Know your limits, and work to overcome them.
It is especially easy to fall into bad habits when training alone. Always take the time to reset your stance and examine your actions while training.Learn new techniques. When you feel comfortable practicing the basics, move on to some more complicated techniques. Don't forget the stuff you know, however. Build your martial knowledge by practicing everything when you train., It is difficult to develop all the necessary skills of a martial artist if you can only train alone. The best thing you can do to progress is find someone to train with you.Your partner does not have to train in the same style as you to be an effective training partner.
Try asking your friends that have an interest in learning martial arts to train with you. It may be easier to learn together.
If you have any friends that train in a martial art, ask them for some pointers, or see if they'd like to spar one day.

, When you can't find a partner, practice shadow boxing. Shadow boxing requires you to picture an opponent in front of you while staying in motion the whole time. You have to visualize both the opponent's movements and yours.








Start at a quarter of the speed you would normally fight. If you want to do it right at full speed, you have to do it slow first. The goal in shadow boxing is accuracy, not speed.When shadow boxing, be aware of the tempo, or rhythm, of your movements. All the elements of fighting are based on timing. If you find yourself speeding up, relax and try to slow it down., Every art uses different muscles. Some place a lot of emphasis on legs, while others favor the arms. While you should aim to keep your entire body strong, find some exercises to keep your art sharp.









If you're a grappler, find exercises that strengthen your core and your back.If you're primarily a striker, find exercises that increase arm strength.

, Don't just focus on building strength. If you want to be an effective martial artist, you need to have good endurance as well. Go running, or ride on a stationary bike. Do anything to get your heart rate up.








Another good way to boost your heart rate is to do a series of calisthenics exercises without taking a break. Calisthenics are exercises that don't require weights. Do push-ups, sit-ups, or jumping jacks to start.Look for more exercises to incorporate into your routine to keep you from getting bored. Try a variety of exercises to target different muscles.

, Flexibility is important in almost every martial art. In learning a martial art you are going to work muscles that tend to get overlooked. Stretching is the only way to keep you from being stiff.








Stretch during your workouts, but also before and after your training sessions.Leg raises are a good way to improve flexibility in your legs. Lift your leg in front of you, maintaining control the entire way up. Don't kick your leg up, lift it slowly. Practice leg raises on the side and behind you to cover your full range of motion.Don't worry if you can't stretch to your fullest. Some days you will be more flexible than others. Stretch to the fullest you can on that day. Progress takes time., Learning a martial art requires you to get hit. You will fall down, you will get hurt. Treat your body right so you can continue to practice.Weekly massages are excellent for muscle recovery, especially in older athletes.Keep in mind that learning a martial art is a lifelong journey. If you have to skip a day don't worry. It's better to train responsibly than to not train at all., You don't need to spend all day in the gym to be a good martial artist. When you consider you need time for training and life outside of the gym, you should try to be as efficient as possible with your workouts.








Try to keep your workouts to around 40 minutes to an hour. If they run longer than that, chances are you are wasting precious time., Martial arts require a lot of activity. You'll need to properly fuel your body if you want to keep training. Find foods that are good for you, and that you enjoy, and make them a part of your diet.The most important part of picking your diet is making sure it is well-balanced. You need a good mixture of protein, carbohydrates, and vegetables.Besides the basics, there a lot of vitamins and minerals your body needs to function. Most of these come from a well-balanced diet, but you may need to take some supplements., As important as it is to find foods you like that are good for you, don't limit yourself to just eating those foods. Experiment with different foods and cook them different ways.Eating a variety of foods also gives you a wider variety of nutrients. The more you mix up your diet, the healthier you will be., Aim for 4-5 small meals a day with some healthy snacks thrown in, rather than eating 3 large meals a day. Adjust your eating habits to suit your training, but above all don't overeat.Try to space your meals out to where you have about 4-4 1/2 hours between each meal. Drink water between meals, and if you must snack, eat a mix of fresh fruits and nuts.If possible, avoid eating at least three hours before you go to bed., When training as a martial artist, it's important that you eat for your health. Don't eat junk foods, and don't drink sodas. Your goal is a balanced diet built on real food.Refined sugars and flours are highly processed. Rather than reaching for cakes and rolls, try grabbing a piece of fruit instead.Instead of soda, try fruit or vegetable juice. Drink green tea instead of coffee. If you have a juicer, you can make a variety of healthy drinks by blending fruits and veggies together."

Slap your stomach area with your palms, about 200 times.,
Slowly increase the strength of your strikes every few days.,
Do the same as step 1, but this time with closed fists.,
After another 6 months have passed, you should be able to strike with considerable force and withstand the attack.

,
Now, get a bag and fill it with mung beans.,
Hit your stomach area from varying angles and covering the entire area, using the bag.,
After another 6 months, you can replace the mung beans with gravel, and repeat the training as before.

,
Yet another 6 months later, replace the gravel with iron or steel ball-bearings, and repeat as before.

,
The training is complete when you are able to strike yourself with maximum force with the bag and be able to withstand the blow.

,
You can test your skill by getting your sparring partner to kick your stomach area with varying degrees of strength.",How to Train Iron Shirt Kung Fu," Your abdominal muscles should be tensed and breathing should be normal. Strike from different angles and cover the entire area, including sides and front, of your stomach. Repeat this everyday.;
, When you are able to hit your stomach with considerable force without much pain, the first stage of training is complete. Be patient - this may take up to 6 months.

, Strike with both the knife-edge and the palm-side of the fist, covering all area.

,, This bag should be made of tough material such as denim, and sewed together with strong thread. Sew it such that it is thin and tubular in shape, and closed at one end. Once filled to maximum capacity with mung beans, one should sew up the other end to enclose the beans.

, As before, do this at least 200 times a day, everyday.

,,,, If they strike you and their leg or arm hurts, you have succeeded in your training."

Find a reputable dojo.,
Learn how to perform Ukemi (falls) properly, and practice often with an instructor present to correct you.,
Work only with high ranks (brown and black belts) until your falls are proficient and you know at least a few throws.,
When practicing throws, do so slowly until you learn the motion.,
Stretch before each practice to avoid pulled muscles.

,
Avoid randori (sparring) until you've been to several classes and know how to fall properly.

,
""Relax"" when being thrown.,
If you feel pain, TAP OUT.",How to Prevent Common Judo Injuries," The best way to do this is to research online, but short of that, a good dojo should be clean, be willing to answer questions if you go in to check it out, have black belt instructors whose ranks have been obtained from the USJA, USJF, or USA Judo, and should request that you join one of these organizations upon joining the dojo. (This will provide you with insurance, and shows that the dojo is recognized by one of the above national organizations.) Also, the judo mats should be clean and in good condition. If there are many children who are very high ranked (ie seven or eight year old brown belts), that can be a warning sign.;
, You should not be thrown until you can fall on the mat without pain 9 times out of 10.

, They will be well versed in working with beginners and will know how not to hurt you.

, This way you avoid making a mistake that could injure you.

,,, This could be the most important step, and the most difficult to do. The temptation when being thrown for the first few months is to tense up- do not do this. An experienced judoka will not throw you in a way that will injure you, and the fall will hurt significantly less if you are relaxed. Furthermore, tensing up when being thrown can cause your partner to make a mistake, which could injure them as well.

, Do not try to muscle through it, or escape from the choke/ arm bar. It is better to tap early rather than get hurt. However, in your first few weeks, no one should be choking or arm barring you anyway.

Watch videos, samplers and tutorials to get an idea of the movements involved;
,
Start learning the basic tricks eg: butterfly kick, tornado kick, pop 360 kick, backtuck, aerial/ martial arts aerial.,
Either, find a group of tricksters near you or try to get some friends into it.,
Know your limits!,
Make a tricking spell book and write the basic tricks down and all of their pre-requisites.,
When you feel like you are good enough you should make a tricking sampler ( a compilation of tricks and combinations that you have, caught on film).,
Enjoy your time tricking!!",How to Start Tricking,", These are the basic moves and are the per-requisite for bigger tricks eg: butterfly kick evolves into a butterfly twist when you ad a 360 spin & a tornado kick turns into a 540 kick when you land on the kicking leg. The basics can be the hardest tricks to land the first time but with practice they become easy.

, But you don't need any one else to trick with, it just helps you learn a little faster. A good way of improving your tricking or of finding other local tricksters is by finding a gymnastics centre that does open gym sessions. Open gym means that you can pay to enter a gym and just do what you want to work on.

, DON'T try a double cork when you can't do a gainer! Some common sense goes a long way. This will help minimise the inevitable... Injuries.

, It just gives you an idea of what you are working towards. Your spell book can include a list of the tricks you can do and want to do, combos that you think of and have seen as well as anything that you feel you might need to keep track of.

, Samplers act as a way of showing others your new skills and can be an archive showing your skills at a particular point in time

, There will be ups and downs, injuries and success. There will be times when you lose a trick and get angry but there are very few feelings better than getting that trick back and sticking it to the God of Losing Tricks by learning another trick that you have wanted for ages.

Get into the mindset.,
Breathe efficiently.,
Maintain form.,
Focus on how your muscles work in tandem.,
Visualize your opponent.,
Project confidence.",How to Practice a Kata1," Focus on yourself in the moment. Turn your attention inward. Tune out all distractions, whether they’re external or internal. Quiet your mind until the kata itself is the only thing you’re thinking about. , Resist holding your breath. Inhale fully for maximum lung capacity. Avoid full exhales since these will leave the body limp and vulnerable. Adjust your rate of breathing as the situation demands, timing it to match your movements. Avoid breathing at a uniform rate throughout the kata. , Concentrate on your posture, balance, and stability. Pay close attention to your hips, since they will help ground your center of gravity. Prioritize form over speed in the beginning and practice your kata slowly to ensure mastering the form before speeding up your movements., Pay attention to how the muscles in each part of your body work together in each movement; for example, when delivering a punch with your fist, pay attention to how your legs and torso lead into the punch. Maximize the force of impact by using all interrelated muscles efficiently.







, Imagine an opponent of equal height and build to yourself. Use your imaginary opponent as a point of focus for both impact and penetration.Pretend that this is a real fight that may prove lethal.

, Maintain an even speed from start to finish.When learning a new kata, start slowly to master its pattern, but as you improve and quicken your speed, achieve that speed from your first step forward to intimidate your opponent.

Start with a simple kata.,
Assume the long forward stance.,
Block your groin.,
Deliver a stomach-level punch.,
Practice 20 counts in each kata.",How to Practice a Kata2," If you’re a beginner, try the Taigyoku Shodan, or “First Kata,” which incorporates only three basic moves: the long forward stance, the groin block, and the stomach-level punch. 







, Bring one foot forward with your knee bent directly above your foot to maintain stability. Extend your back leg straight behind you as step forward. As you move from stance to stance, move your body in a lateral line without bouncing up and down, as you would when walking or running. Keep your center of gravity constant to minimize being knocked off balance by your opponent. , Using the arm on the same side of your body as your forward foot, raise your fist over your opposite shoulder, then sweep it downward, protecting your groin and striking your opponent’s attacking limb. Finish with your blocking arm held straight and pointed downward over your forward leg, with your fist about a fist’s distance directly above your knee.








As you prepare to block, pull your other arm back as you prepare to block, until it’s even with your floating ribs and ready to strike if needed. Also pull your hips back at a 45º angle, facing away from your forward foot and drawing your vitals farther out of reach from your opponent., Advance toward your opponent with the long forward stance, keeping your upper body absolutely still until your forward foot is about to touch down. Square your hips and shoulders to fully face your opponent. Strike from the same side as your forward foot, aiming for the solar plexus. Pull your other arm back until your fist is even with your floating ribs, ready to deliver a second strike if needed. 







, Perform a 360º sweep of the immediate area. Turn your head 90º to face a new direction along your shoulder. Rotate your body from the hips to maintain stability.







"
"
Learn new kata patterns.,
Be ambidextrous.,
Visualize yourself.,
Practice with external distractions.,
Mess yourself up beforehand.",How to Practice a Kata3," Explore different styles of martial arts, each of which includes multiple kata. Once you’ve mastered one, learn another. Widen your skill-set with more techniques and combinations.








, Practice both sides of your body an even number of times. Perform the kata with your favored side and then your weaker side (the left side for right-handed people; the right side for left-handed people)., Picture your own movements within each kata as well as your imaginary opponent’s. Imagine yourself from your own first-person point-of-view, as opposed to an external, third-person POV. Project a mental image for your body to fulfill in action. Practice this while physically practicing katas or while doing something else entirely.It may also be helpful to practice in front of a full length mirror.

, Once you’ve mastered a kata while alone in a controlled environment, seek out or create a less controlled environment. Sharpen your ability to focus on your kata while other elements try to call attention to themselves. Perform your kata in front of other people, in noisy areas, and/or in less than ideal weather, such as heavy rain, snow, heat, etc., Practice rebounding from internal distractions. Stub your toe, spin around until you’re dizzy, or work yourself up into a rage over something that’s been bothering you lately. Then perform your kata in this less than ideal mindset, which will resemble your mental state in an actual fight much more closely than always practicing with a calm mind will."

Choose.,

Be in somewhat decent shape.,
Understand the tradition.,
Understand the role of your sensei.,
Respect your dojo.,
Understand the motivations of other students.,
Trust your yuki.,
Develop the right mindset.,
Practice.,
Think well inside and out.,
Don't show off.",How to Prepare for Martial Arts Training," It all depends on what you want. Do you want to learn at a calm, slow pace until you get the moves right? Or do you want to advance fast, training as though you are in a combat situation and quickly learning how to correct mistakes. The choice depends on you, your age, your physical condition, etc.;
, Which school? There are many factors that go into choosing a school to train in. Search on this site for ""how to choose a martial arts school"" for information. This is very important, as the style and master you decide on greatly affects how you learn.

, You don't have to work out before hand, since martial arts isn't about strength. But endurance is key. You will learn to fight 1 on 1 or 10 on 1 eventually, so the faster you can move for a long period of time the better you will perform.

, The original purpose of martial arts was so people could defend themselves against multiple attackers, even to the death. Much has changed, and there are many people today who misjudge the purpose of martial arts. The true purpose is to train to stay alive against many people who are trying to kill you.

, Your master is your friend, your motivation, and your worst enemy (if he is good). He/she should push you beyond your believed capabilities training you to never give up during a fight. Ask him/her for help, but try to figure things out for yourself first. Understand you're not the only one there, others have come for the same reason so don't keep the instructor to yourself. Don't be a loner either, or you'll never learn. Realize his job and yours before you join a school.

, There are no games here. You don't fool around, especially while your sensei is speaking. Respect your dojo as much as you respect your fellow students. Always show up early for lessons.

, Your purpose for being at a dojo might not be the same as some peoples'. If there are kids, they want to be power rangers or show off their moves to friends. If there are adults, the younger ones are arrogant and wild. The older adults just there to learn. You will meet all types. If the sensei is a good one, he will quickly dismiss any student who is out of order and continue the lesson. Show no attention to anyone who acts for others and not himself.

, Eventually, you will be assigned a yuki. While only for the one lesson, this person is your trusted partner. You must show each other great, mutual respect for you will be fighting him. This is the person you practice your moves on, or spar against, and they you. Depending on the style, learn what attacks to hold back power on so you don't injure this person. When practicing techniques, do them slow until you gain the right control. Help your yuki learn as well as you do. On the other hand, have no sympathy for this person. When you spar, do it violently with control. Don't go easy on them but don't hit them hard. In a nutshell: attack fast and aggressively, but with controlled power. You are there to learn to defeat people like this, not to play around.

, You will do aerobics, you will sweat, you will be tired, and you will get hurt. But do not stop. If you practice right, you will hurt someone or get hurt yourself. Don't take it personally. If you are sparring and get injured, take a few breaths and don't resume with the fury you will have. You will feel like swinging wildly and acting aggressively to keep them at a distance, but do not do this. The concept behind martial arts is staying calm while staying alive. If you are not calm, your yuki will get mad or worse, your sensei will. If you injure your opponent, don't apologize, just don't do it again. Wait for them to signal ready and resume sparring.

, Practice every technique you are shown until it becomes second nature, and then some. Think beyond what you are shown and question your sensei about it. Figure out what else could work for that situation. Strip down anything you don't like. Unless you are having a test on the subject, it's always best to keep the simple ideas rather than the 21-step takedown.

, Think of your dojo as a holy place. Any outside aggression, anything that is on your mind, you must drop as soon as you enter your dojo. This includes any quarrels with a fellow student who may be in that lesson. Otherwise, how can you concentrate on what needs to be done?

, Don't let it known that you are taking martial arts, or what belt color you have. Discrepancy works best for you in a real fight. Also, someone might pick a fight with you just because you are taking the art. Think of your new skills as something mediocre. You wouldn't tell everyone what you drew the night before or the dreams you had, the Arts are no different.

Work up to getting used to the impact.,

You're preparing for a scenario where you may be choked, stabbed, held up with guns, ambushed by multiple attackers, put in compromising situations and forced to fight blind. This is street/battlefield fighting, not a sport with rules. Don't stop! Don't ever stop. You must be ready to keep going, no matter the obstacles you face.
, This is your best weapon. Unless someone wants to hurt you specifically, an offender will choose to attack a weak person, an easy target. How you walk, if you look at the ground or in front of you, signal whether you're a victim or not. And if someone is bothering you, use your voice as a weapon. Be ready to answer with confidence. , You may receive cuts and bruises. You may bleed. More severe injuries are possible, but unlikely as pains are taken to make the training as safe as possible. Remember, you must be able to perform the defenses when you are at your worst. That is when it matters most. The warm-up is designed to gas you out so that you begin learning when you're already at your quitting point. If a bad guy tries to do something with you when you are fresh, and you're used to doing these defenses when you're weak and tired - you will be that much more difficult to take advantage of., A real life situation is quite different than training in a safe and comfortable environment that is your Krav Maga school. Without proper training, you might freeze or lose control. Practice exercises and drills to train your mind and body to deal with a high level of stress. It is usually done by simulating real life like situations with a high intensity, great violence and pressure. , The physical conditioning is tough, and it takes most people a couple months of regular training to get caught up so that they don't get as sore for as long. You need to focus on what it is you are trying to accomplish - this is not something where a referee is going to step and save you because you're too tired to continue. This is something where you must finish the fight no matter how many times you've been stabbed. Most street fights last 6 to 10 seconds, so we train to fight for two minutes., This is the easy part. Cross-fitters and general athletes generally have the easiest time. Long distance runners and power lifters tend to have a hard time, because the training will take you from zero percent effort to 100 percent effort and back very rapidly. If you're just getting off the couch for the first time, it will be hardest of all - but don't stop. Whatever your fitness level or type, your body will adjust after a few months., You will deaden nerves in certain areas. This takes much longer. Your shins, wrists and quads will become deadened to pain and will become harder. Bruising will eventually become something that doesn't happen much in these areas, but you can count on having lots of colorful bruises on a more or less constant basis for at least the first year., If you can learn how to breathe out when you strike, or are struck early on, that will help with your conditioning quite a bit. The natural thing to do is to hold your breath while these things are happening, and if you do that, you will tire out extremely fast."

Get a good night's rest.,
Decide whether you want to train fasted.,
If you do decide to train fasted, prepare yourself.,
If you decide to eat before training eat light - no more than 300 to 400 calories.,
Dress properly.,
Get your head right.",How to Prepare for Krav Maga," Being well rested will help with willpower, which is important for mentally overcoming the hard physical conditioning you will be engaging in.
, Training fasted is great for fat loss, but has some rather major drawbacks - not all people suffer from all of them, or to the same degree. Training after a meal will eliminate most of those drawbacks, but may slow or stop some fitness goals.

Here are some drawbacks to training fasted:

Decreased energy, leading to ""gassing out"" quickly.
Muscle loss due to low glycogen levels prompting your body to break down muscle for energy.
Trouble concentrating due to dizziness.


Drawbacks to training after eating:

Reduced fat loss.
Possibility of puking due to over-exertion or a knee to the stomach.
Some foods, or too much food, may cause lethargy.


Benefits to training fasted:

Increased fat loss.
An increase in your body's energy efficiency.


Benefits to training after eating:

Increased energy levels - assuming the ""right"" type of meal is eaten beforehand.
Prevention of muscle loss.



, Take Citrulline Malate, Beta Alanine and some Leucine an hour before going to train, and also put some in your water for while you train. This will help keep your energy levels up and prevent fatiguing.

Consume some protein immediately after you finish training to preserve and build muscle.

,

Eat something that doesn't put you to sleep. This tends to be different for each person. Some people find fatty meats to be energizing and others find them to induce food coma. You'll have to experiment if you don't already know what kinds of food get your body going.

, The basic idea is to make sure that you have comfortable, light shoes and coverings for your knees, arms and shoulders. Men should have a protective cup and women should take precautions so that they can jump around without discomfort., In Krav Maga, there is an assumption for training purposes that you are in a potentially lethal situation, and you need to get your head in the game. You won't have a good training session if you are daydreaming or otherwise not focused. It's ok if you're groggy, but try to follow along. If you find you'd rather be chatting with other classmates or staring at the ceiling, then you need to buckle down and focus on the matter at hand."

Choose the board.,
Angle.,
Have someone to hold the board.,
Have the right stance.,
Relax.,
Do it.",How to Position a Board to Break It in Martial Arts," Get a holder who is the same size, weight, and is either as old or older than you. Don't get a beginner who has never held before, they will naturally flinch and mess you up.;
, For single board breaks, set up the board in the direction you are attacking. If it is a front kick, angle the board slightly forward and near the holder's stomach level, don't kick a vertical board. If it is a higher front kick, have them stand on a chair. If you are punching, make the board vertical. For both of these techniques, you want the holder to hold with their hands on top and bottom. For a hammer strike or knee strike you want to have them hold the sides. Elbow strikes are held on top and bottom, but the attacker is slightly to one side. For side kicks, make sure you use the heel. And for elbow strikes, use the fleshly part of the forearm instead of the bony elbow. For hammer strikes, have the holder go to a knee and angle the board backward at a 45 degree angle, not horizontal, and at their chest level. It will feel uncomfortable.

, The holder should hold the board at its very edges. The fingers should be scrunched up uncomfortably and not spread outward onto the board surface, for obvious reasons. Thumb tips should ride along the side of the board and not on either face except at the back slightly. The palms should support the back of the board only at the edge. There should be a space between the inside of the fingers and the side of the board big enough for a couple pencils to slide through if the thumbs were moved. Arms are out almost straight, but visibly bent. When the strike occurs, the holder should have their head turned to a side to prevent debris from hitting the face. Eyes should not be shut.

, The holder should be in a front stance. To do this, they stand feet together. For a right handed person, the left foot moves 2 feet (0.6 m) to the left and 4 footsteps to the front. Back leg straight, front leg visibly bent. Torso is leaning forward so shoulders are above the thighs and no further. If the holder is off-balance, have them move their front foot wider. The back heel should be planted on the ground. For right handed people, the right hand should be on the bottom of the board, head turned right.


If the breaker is doing a downward punch or foot stomp, use two cinder-blocks as supports instead of a person.







, Holder should be relaxed but stable until breaker is ready. At this point the holder tenses up preparing for the shock-wave of the hit. This relaxation helps ease pain in the finger and leg positions. Please! Warn your holder before you actually hit.

,


Double+ boards. For more than one board, two holders should be used. Both use front stances and position feet so both are comfortable and stable. Hands should criss-cross. From the holder's viewpoint, the left holder should have their right hand crossing the right holder's left, grabbing the lower right corner of the boards. Left hand is placed at top left. Top/bottom-Side positions remain the same as for single boards. Sometimes, the second holder can simply support the first holder's back. This goes for single boards too.






Types of boards. Assuming the right type of board is chosen, there are qualities to it that help in breaking. Boards with knots should be used for kicks and the knots best avoided. The strike should go with the grain of the board. For punches and elbows, the grain should be horizontal. All boards have a bend in them. You want the bend to go away from you so it breaks easier. The holder can even flex the board for extra help. If the wood has sap in it, it will be harder to break. If it has been left in a cold place for a while, this also makes it hard to break.

Tools needed: hammer and chisel (used together), sandpaper, shaving plane, metal file (preferably steel).,
Gather a good branch of hardwood; this should be off a live tree.,
Use a chisel to flatten.,
You will want a round blade for practice; so to form the round blade chisel diagonally on the back of the piece in a sloped angle of 3:30 and 9:30 (think of a clock face).,

Finishing the product sand out as many marks as you can.,
Apply clear acrylic coating; simply spray an even coat and let it dry.",How to Make a Bokken,";
, A branch from the ground is unsuitable for any real use. How you get is should be with permission if you get it from someone else's property. Let the wood dry for a month in a place heated and dehumidified in a stable manner.

, If there are areas pulling out and ripping stop at the side of the knot. Chisel both sises of the knot and afterward use a shaving plane and grind down the knot. Chisel marks do not matter; this will not be a museum piece.

, You will then make the back completely flat by chiseling it in the back until it is completely flat. The length of the blade and the intersection style is your choice.

, Every martial art requires different hand blade proportions. This step is done with a shaving plane.

, Smooth as much as you can with metal file afterward for a finer finish.

, Ninja swords were straight and shorter than the curved katana a samurai used. Although every sword is different, and the Ninja had their own specifications like any other sword school, they are all Katana (Nihonto), they were either forged as Koto (old sword) Shinto (new sword) or Shinsakuto (New Revival Sword). It is in recent years that people have begun to believe that ninjas used secret techniques and special swords. It IS true that they had their own fighting systems with a sword, but keeping sword techniques a secret was the regular practice of almost all japanese sword schools. If you want to learn Ninjutsu, Study with a Qualified Bujinkan Instructor.


There is a saying: ""the sword that saves man kills man ."" The sword is a tool for killing. No matter whose hands it is in. If you want to master a sword, then you must be at peace with death, both your own and someone else's.
You cannot move at superhuman speeds just because you know how to use a sword. It does not make you faster or give you some kind of power. A sword is a special chunk of metal. The skills you learn after many hours of practice with a qualified teacher do not open up a floodgate of secret energy within you. Nothing, not even the samurai, is unbound by the laws of Physics and Geometry when a sword is used correctly.
You can't cut through trees in one slice. And if you try you'll probably ruin your sword, the cutting you see in movies is either faked or done with bamboo, which can be cut at such.

, Yes, the compass directions.


Stand facing forward, you can define four quadrants easily (think of this as though you're facing north, even if your not): north, south, east, and west. Now think about the four sub-quadrants, called octants: Northwest, northeast southwest, and southeast. These make up a total of eight ways. You can do a simple exercise to learn them, too.
Stand with your right foot forward, left foot back, pointed out to your left, they shouldn't be too far apart, but they shouldn't be too close together, either. Now step with your right foot and bring your left foot so that you're exactly like you were before. That's one, or north.
Here comes the hard part: the pivoting technique. Examine your stance, with as little effort as possible, turn to the stronger side. In swordsmanship, a strong-side turn is simply turning to the side that will make you use lesser amount of effort when compared to the otherwise. (Whilst turning otherwise is called back-turn or weak-side turn.) If your right foot is forward, pivot back to your left, vice versa.
Now step in with your leading foot and turn back to your first direction. That's called Zango. Two directions of movement, and that's also how you do the eight ways. Move through on a strong side pivot to 3, which comes instead of the redirect north. Do zango. 5, 6, 7, and 8 are a little different. From 4, turn 45 degrees to your strong side by sliding your back foot (in this case, your right) in to face the fifth way. Zango from this and do the same to reach 7 and 8. When you hit 8, you should be easily be able to turn back to one. Do that 1000 times. If you want something a little more interesting, try stepping backwards instead of forwards. Then combine the two by doing both. That is Hachi Kata (Method of Doing 8 , or Hachi Do (lit. Eight way).

, It will pass your eyes and ears often. It's a simple phonetic language and can be learned easily. Ask a native speaker to teach you to pronounce, or watch some subtitled anime.

, No matter how hard you try, you can't master the sword on your own, or with videos. Try for any style done pre-17th century. Try to stay away from Kendo, it's a sport and you are not likely to do any real cutting, but if that's all you can find go for it.

,


Take the sword (still sheathed) in your left hand, blade side up (outside of the curve facing up) and by the upper part of the saya (sheath). Pull it up against your left side as though it were in your Obi (belt).
Grasp (don't grab) the Nakago (hilt) right below the Tsuba (hand-guard), and pull straight out, as though you were using the Nakagojiri (very end of the hilt, the end cap) to hit your opponents stomach.
STOP THERE. Imagine yourself in samurai armor. How would you stop from cutting your webbing and/or arm?
Step your left foot back as you draw out and move the sword in an arc over, and point the tip as though you were pointing it at the chest of an enemy as tall as you.
Set the saya aside and put your left hand on the nakagojiri, so the the bottom of your hand ends at the end of the sword.
To look like you know what you're doing, rotate the blade to the Ura (left) by a few degrees. Congrats, you're now in right-foot-forward-center(or middle)-guard position.

,


Stand in Center guard with your right foot lead. Now raise the sword up, so that it's blade points about 45 degrees behind you (i.e. straight up would be 90, straight back would be 0). This is Right foot forward upper position.
Stand in right foot upper, and move the blade down, until it forms a 45 degree angle pointing down, don't move your shoulders off your center. This is right foot lower position.
Move to right foot upper and step your left foot in so that it is in the lead and your right foot is pointed to your right side, do this without moving the sword. This is left foot upper.
Move the sword out to the side of your head, pointed about 15 degrees off of the 90, but don't hold it right next to your head, because you're still wearing a helmet, and a wide one at that. This is left foot lead, middle.
Square up your body, while still keeping your right foot behind, and your left foot forward, move the handle of the sword to your center, while the blade is still pushed back. This is left foot forward lower.

, They are merely springboards to your movements. Practice moving between these on your own, but not fast. Move slowly and fluidly, speed will come later. Then get a partner and have him move while you match, then match him a-symmetrically, by doing something different, but at the same rate. Be the shadow to the eagle. Then have your partner be the shadow to your eagle.

, Start out in right foot lead, center guard. Raise the sword over your head into an upper-esque looking move, but not the same. Swing the sword down, and bring the handle to your center. That is called Shomen'uchi (downward cut to the head). Another thing to try is Yokomen'uchi, a downward cut to the side of the head or neck. (If your taking Aikido, all of these words will be falling into place shortly) The cut you just made is the primary technique of Japanese kenjutsu (swordsmanship) no matter what school.

, Kenjutsu is something that takes stamina, so you need to practice. Take the cut you just learned and do it 1000 times, sets of 5, 10, or 50. That burn your going to feel will teach you what you need to know. But remember, practice makes perfect, so if your doing it wrong, you'll keep doing it wrong. So join a dojo.

, They can be made by a slide (actually, it's a step, but it's a step with your lead foot, that's why your sword stance needs to have your feet close) a step, or just standing. Just remember to index your cut from above your head. That means to pick it up over your head before you cut, because you might have to turn around and cut an enemy behind you before dealing with whoever is in front of you. Example of indexing is left foot lead, lower position. Your instinct is to deal with what's in front of you, so naturally you would draw the blade past your ear. Instead you need to pick it up over your head, pretty much into upper, then make your cut.

, Do 10 sets of 10 of all of the cuts you can think of every day or so(remember to do downward cuts, not sweeps and thrusts) . You find it gets a lot easier over time, and you can move to heavier bokken (wooden sword), suburito(a heavier bokken, usually more than 6 pounds) , or iaito (an unsharpened katana).

, When you do, you're on your way to becoming a skilled swordsman, but this is all I can teach you, you need to go find a school of kenjutsu in your area. If you can't, and your devoted enough, move. There are good schools all over America, and usually your local community college will offer classes in a Japanese Martial Art, if hey don't teach Kenjutsu they might know someone who does.

Get two wooden dowels.,
Get 2 feet (0.6 m) of rope.,
Drill a hole through the top of each dowel.,
Drill a smaller hole through the side of each dowel.,
Feed one end of the rope through the side hole and out the top of one of the dowels.,
Repeat this process with the other end of the rope.,
Fill the top holes with glue.,
Finished.",How to Make a Nunchaku1," They should be about the length of your forearm, the distance from your elbow to your wrist, or about 3⁄4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) thick in diameter. If you want, you can paint them black or another color to make them look a bit more threatening. But keeping the wood bare can be nice, too. Each dowel should be about a foot long, if you're shorter than 6 feet (1.8 m), and about 16"" if you are taller, because the Nunchaku should be able to go around your body. If they're too small for you, you won't be able to use them effectively.


If you cannot find two dowels that are about this size, you can get a larger dowel rod and use a hand saw, jigsaw, or a band saw to cut it into two pieces.;
, The rope or rawhide string should ideally be around 2 feet (0.6 m) long, or a bit longer if you're taller than 6 feet (1.8 m). Your best bet is to procure some 3/16 nylon braided rope. You can also buy more rope and just cut it to meet the length requirements you need. This doesn't mean you'll have 2 feet (0.6 m) of rope between the nunchucks; you'll have less because you'll have to tie each end of the rope to the dowels.

, The hole should be wide enough to place the rope into, and should go at least 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) deep into each top of the stick. Use a 3/8 drill bit, or an even thinner one, depending on the diameter of your Nunchaku.

, Now, you should drill a smaller hole through one side of each dowel, so that the rope can be looped through this hole and the top hole so you can tie it in place. This hole should reach the main hole so that the rope can go through it easily. It should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of each dowel; if the hole is too close to the top, the rope may open up the hole and come out of it after frequent use.

, Then, tie it securely to hold it in place. Make sure you leave enough room (at least a few inches) for you to be able to securely tie the end of the rope in place.

, Now that you have secured one end of the rope to the wooden dowel, you can secure the other end of the rope to the other wooden dowel.

, Use regular glue or crazy glue to add stability to the Nunchaku and to secure the rope in place.

, Just wait a few minutes for the glue to dry, and get ready to use those nunchucks! You can even begin to learn some nunchuck skills.

Get one piece of PVC pipe that is at least 7 feet (2.1 m) long.,
Cut the PVC pipe into two pieces.,
Place the end caps on the two pieces of pipe.,
Use a power drill to drill a hole in the top of each end cap.

,
Screw the screw eyes into the holes.,
Connect the ends of the chain to each screw eye.,
Wrap the electrical tape around the pipe.,
Finished.",How to Make a Nunchaku2," The pipe should also be ¾ inches in diameter. You will need to use a handsaw, hacksaw, or miter saw to cut the piece into two parts. The pipe should be hollow inside so the Nunchaku aren’t too heavy or dangerous.

, You should make it so that the length of each pipe is as long as the distance from your wrist to your elbow, which should be about one foot long each. If you’re over 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, it may be a little longer.

, If you have PVC cement, then you can use it to secure the end caps on the ends of each length of pipe (you’ll need two end caps for each piece).

,, Make sure to screw them in until they’re nice and snug. The screw eyes should be about a ½ inch in diameter.

, Now, take a 12-inch piece of metal chain and use some needle nose pliers to bend open the link at each end of the chain so it opens up enough to put it around the screw eyes. Place each opened link around the screw eye and use the pliers to close the link again, so you’ve made it so that the screw eye is essentially just another link in the chain. Do this to both ends of the chain.

, Now, carefully wrap some black electrical tape around each pipe as much as you want. You can cover the entire pipe, or leave the end caps out to create a pipe with two colors. Either way, the black tape will give your Nunchucks a sleeker, more sophisticated look.

, You’re all done! Now, enjoy training with your home-made weapon!

Cut two foam tubes into 2 twelve-inch sections.,
Use a ballpoint pen to create a hole from one side of the tube to the other.,
Run a pipe cleaner through each hole and tie the ends together.,
Tie a thin rope to each of the pipe cleaner circles.,
Finished.",How to Make a Nunchaku3," You can use a sharp knife or an X-Acto knife to create two foam tubes, if you don't have tubes of that length already. Each tube should be about the length from your wrist to your forearm, so if you are smaller or making these for a child, then they may be a bit smaller than one foot each. These foam nunchuks are a perfect addition to a Halloween costume and are completely safe to use, though they are not the most effective.

, The pen should be positioned horizontally to each tube, and should make a hole from one end to the other. This should be about 1/2-1 inch down from each tube's top.

, Take about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of pipe cleaner, run it through the two holes on one tube, tie it together at the top of the tube, leaving about an inch of space. Then, repeat the process on the other tube, so you now have two tubes with two little pipe cleaner circles at the top.

, Now, just take a thin piece of rope that is around 3 feet (0.9 m) long and tie each end of the rope to the pipe cleaner circles you created. Leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) on each end of the rope.

, You're all done -- now enjoy your light, safe Nunchaku!

If you don't feel you can win, it's OK to stage a tactical retreat and return later with reinforcements (i.e.,
Practise.",How to Learn the Basics of Soresu," If you are defending for a prolonged period of time, you will get tired.;
, Place your dominant foot behind you. Hold your dominant hand behind you, at head height. Point your lightsaber forwards. Hold out your non-dominant hand as a challenge. Obi-Wan uses this stance when he fights General Grievous on Utapau.

, Obviously, it's more energy-saving to step out of the way than to block by flinging your lightsaber around yourself. Dodging can be very effective, but make sure you get completely out of the way or you could still get hit. If your opponent is using a lightsaber, get even further out of the way, as they can change the angle of attack partway through.

, If you have some experience in Shii-Cho, you should already know this. If you don't:


A head block (zone 1) consists of holding your lightsaber horizontally in front of or above your head.
A leg block (zones 5 and 6) consists of holding your lightsaber near your hip, with the blade pointing downwards.
A body block (zones 2 and 3) consists of holding your lightsaber near your waist, or slightly higher, with the blade pointing upwards.
A back block (zone 4) consists of holding your lightsaber at the back of your head, with the blade pointing downwards.

, If you can spin your lightsaber very fast on either side of you, in a figure-eight motion, you can create a nearly impenetrable blade wall. You should find two ways of doing this, one where the blade is moving downwards as it passes in front of you and one where it is moving upwards as it passes in front of you. This maneuver is very good for deflecting blaster bolts.

, Try to gain the high ground, seek shelter, etc.

, Soresu advocates not attacking until your opponent has tired themselves to the point where their defense has begun to falter. Depending on your opponent's stamina, this could be a long time.

, A saberstaff, or double-bladed lightsaber, has twice the blade area of a regular saber, so it is easier to defend with. In addition, you only have to make slight movements with it to provide full defensive coverage. Saberstaffs specialised for Soresu tend to have shorter blades than usual, making them easier to handle at the expense of range.

, run away and come back with your mates).

, You can practise lightsaber attacks and parries with bamboo canes, or actual lightsaber if you have them. You can practise blast deflection by getting your mates to lob ping-pong balls at you, or shoot you with nerf guns. Don't use anything where you could get injured.

Learn strikes.,
Continue on to learn more complex moves, or invent a few.,
Progress on to wood.",How to Learn to Use Nunchaku by Yourself," That means a foam handle, with either cord or a chain to join them together. Internet martial arts sites will almost definitely have pairs available. It is always better to accidentally hit yourself with foam than wood or metal.


A Nunchaku is a weapon, so you should look up where you are allowed to carry it. Also, price the durability and cheapness of the weapon.;
, Go to a place that does not have a lot of things to break., Twirl them around slowly until you get the feel of them, then practice passing from hand to hand and doing figure of 8's. When you get confident, you can always speed up.

, Learn to do the figure of 8, passing it underarm, striking left and right and to stop it by wrapping it around your waist. When you learn these simple moves, you will be set up to do progressively trickier stuff. Alternatively,purchase a book on nunchaku basics. Martial artists have used these for hundreds of years. Use their expertise.

, Take the weapon and strike it against objects in proper manners, i.e. strike the head area and other pressure points that would protect you in a fight. Always use protective gear or a mannequin.

Take the weapon and put it under your arm.
Then take the end your holding and flip it out toward a target.
This is just one way. You can use the strokes to strike people as well.

, By the time you get to the advanced techniques in the back of the books, you should be able to combine a few moves and invent your own. You can even learn to throw it up and catch it!

, As light and quick as foam is, you're now ready for the big challenge. the difference between the wood and foam chunks is weight. Start off slow again and get used to the increased weight. Practice all the techniques you've learned slowly. When you're ready, speed them up again!

Change your mindset and outlook on life.,
In order to become a successful martial artist, you have to take a martial arts class.,
Change your mindset once again into not allowing your one style to become who you are as a martial artist.,
Study a mixture martial arts.,
Work in your martial arts, and always do some type of training everyday.,
Be patient.,
Start to develop your own style of fighting and your own style of the martial arts you learn.",How to Learn Martial Arts," Martial arts is not teaching you how to fight (that's more like kickboxing). Martial arts is training your mind and body to work as one in a combative like aliveness.;
, Unfortunately this means picking a style. When choosing a class you want to find dedicated martial arts instructors who will really teach you the style, step by step. The convenience and actually knowing what you learn is more important than the style you choose. On the other hand, if you are in a situation where both instructors could teach you successfully, then choose the style you like the best or what is in convenience for you.

, Always study every style that you can, and do not like or dislike any type of martial art or fighting style no matter what. If you do, this will only limit your knowledge and cause you to become weak in the mind.

, Everyone's different so one form could be the best for you and not work out for your friend. Experiment and see which one's best for you.

, The most important part about martial arts is training. Always train, (even if it's just standing on one leg for balance).

, In order to see a difference in your fighting combat, it usually takes up to 3 to 6 months of hardcore dedicated training. Also, martial arts takes years to master THE BASICS. But once you know the basics, the principles and the stylish tricks become second-nature.

, Be free, don't be robotic into all of the forms you learn. Even as you first start out being a martial artist, have a time set in which you openly fight being free. Remember to be humble, bragging to your friends about how good you are, or use it against someone or something is NOT what Martial Arts was made for. Let the forms become you don't become the forms. Eventually, you will develop a naturally unnatural fighting combat or an unnaturally natural fighting combat.

Learn about the body's very vulnerable areas: These are commonly known as pressure points.,

Striking the flat of the forehead forces the head back with little resistance and will actually rock the brain within the skull, causing a concussion, or worse.,

Temples: The temples are the thinnest part of the cranium, so a good blow here (one-knuckle punch is ideal) can cause concussion, hemorrhaging, or even death.,

Temple 2: When this area is hit, the victim may be rendered unconscious, in some cases dead.,

Neck/sleeper: This is another more obvious pressure point but is very complicated in application.,

Look for the collar bone.,

The easiest way to strike is probably with a knife hand (karate chop) turned up side down.,

Under the jaw: Grab the neck on the front and reach under the jaw.,

TMJ: Support the head with one hand.,

Forearm/crevice: The crevice of your forearm is made entirely of muscles and tendons, so there's lots to work with.,

Back of the hand: If you are grabbed, look directly at the hand of your assailant, and with either a regular or single-knuckle punch, strike the bones in the back of the hand.,
Pinch the fingers for a simple defense.,

Sternum: Strike with a single-knuckle to the bone in the middle of the chest.,

Solar plexus: This is a bundle of nerves deep within the center of the abdomen, thought to be responsible for the physical feelings of deep emotions.,

Love handles: Place your hand flat on the side of the abdomen, between the ribs and hips.,

Ribs: The ribs have very little covering, regardless of the body type, and only thin muscle between them.,

Feet: Look down at the foot, and using your heel, raise your knee as high as you can, and stomp on the arch of the foot as hard as you can.,
If feeling drowsy or can't concentrate using both pointer fingers, apply pressure.,
Headaches are a pain.,
Bear in mind that speed is key in a fight.,
Practice on yourself and with a friend.,
Practice your focus.,
Hone your techniques.,
Move your weight toward the direction you're putting pressure.,
Practice the recoil.,
Yell.","How to Learn Martial Arts ""Pressure Points"""," The points include the eyes, the groin, the shins, etc. In general, things to consider include:

Use kicks that use the wide of your foot for the shins (if you know them) as they will make it harder to miss.
Pull your foot back quickly when kicking to the groin so your foot won't be caught. The nose is easily broken with any strike.;
, Beginners should use the heel of their palm, rather than a fist. The same holds true to the back of the skull, just below the horizontal ridge. (The front has one too, above the flat.) The ridges are strong enough to be used as weapons in their own right, so avoid them., Do not actually strike a training partner with this move., This can be achieved using a ""phoenix eye"" punch which involves extending the index finger (search online for an image). Do not attempt to use this punch unless you are in genuine danger., Get behind your assailant and wrap one arm around his neck, using your radius (forearm bone), apply pressure to the external carotid artery (just to the side of the throat where you feel your pulse beating), slowly lowering them to the ground as you do so. You can increase the pressure by pulling your arm toward you with the other arm, and breathing in as you do, puffing up your chest. You can also place the hand of the squeezing arm in the elbow of the other arm and push the head/neck forward with that other arm. If they show no signs of weakening a sharp blow to the back of the head will disorientate them giving you a chance to run.

To counter: Turn your head toward the elbow. The crevice will not press on your throat, and you will be able to breath. Circulation will still be a problem, so you must be quick. Grab the elbow with the closest hand and use the pressure point there. This will loosen their grip, but they will likely not give up. Combine pulling down with biting, foot-stomping, head-butting, eye-gouging, bringing your heel to their groin, shin-kicking, rib-elbowing (turn your hips), hair-pulling, and anything else you can come up with.

, Once located, jab your fingers behind bone and force to the ground (this needs to be performed within about 1/4 second in an actual assault)., A fist will have trouble fitting between the jaw and collarbone. You can also grab and squeeze the throat, and even give it a good yank to dislocate it and make breathing impossible. That is, of course, quite lethal and should be used only as a last resort when there is no other alternative., Squeeze while pressing upward., With the other, follow the jawline to the highest point, just under the ear, where it meets the bump in your skull. Apply pressure inward and upward towards your ear. This is painful and makes speaking very difficult. If possible, a person will try to move away from it, hence the supporting hand. A single-knuckle punch (the second middle finger knuckle) to this spot could dislocate the jaw., Grab the elbow with your thumb on top. Place your fingers on the back of the elbow for a good grip. squeeze the tip of your thumb toward the tips of your index or middle finger. You have to reinforce the thumb with your fingers, or you'll lose leverage. Press the thumb into the middle of the crevice, into either side of the crevice, or into the lump on the outer forearm formed when you make a fist (the brachioradialis). Experiment with this one. It can be rather tricky., When practicing with a partner, give it one good shot, so you're not doing it all day. It only hurts for a minute., When punches are thrown, catch one in your armpit and lock down tight. Grab the upper inner part of the elbow joint––this needs to be done fast. Pinch down hard one finger on each side. This causes excruciating pain and will make your opponent's arm feel like it's breaking.

, It has no muscle and never much fat, so it is very vulnerable, and if struck properly can break in two down the middle. You can also strike the pectorals like this. Breaking the sternum can cause a punctured lung or worse. Be very careful with this and do not practice on friends., By striking the area just below the sternum, where the ribs join on the front of the abdomen, you affect this bundle of nerves and cause the diaphragm (breathing muscle) to contract violently. This is ""knocking the wind out"" of someone. It's a very easy target. This can be countered by flexing the abs quickly at the time of impact, which is accomplished by breathing out or yelling (kiai)., Roll your fingers in toward your palms. Do not pinch. Pinching does next to nothing. This will work on any body type., To break them, raise the arm to extend them, reducing their ability to reinforce each other, and step towards them when you strike. A palm-down knife hand works very well for this. Uppercuts also work for this as they seem to be designed to get right up under the arm, which is what you're aiming for. The rib areas protected by the muscles of the chest or back will not be easily broken, if at all. The lowest ribs connect only to the spine and so are especially vulnerable to breaking., Because of its structure, it can easily be broken. Do not strike the toes. It will hurt, but you certainly won't break anything. Try each with light pressure and see which hurts more., Apply this pressure to temples, the flanks of the bridge of your nose and the corners of your eyes about 5mm from the bridge of your nose.

, Temporary relief or dulling of pain can be achieved by using the appropriate pressure point.


Front of head: Massage both temples
Middle/top of head: Apply pressure to point just above ears.
Back of head: Place both thumbs just behind ears and trace backwards until you find the point where your skull ends. Move another mm inwards and apply pressure.

, If you're stuck fumbling with a pressure point, you're going to get knocked in the head. Practice often, practice safely. Practice as if you were in a real fight. Start slow, and get the placement down. Then, use all the intensity and speed that you can. You fight how you practice, so if you're practicing slow or sloppy, that's how you'll fight, and you probably won't last long.


If your focus is on speed, breathe normally (Bak Mei Kung Fu). Your arms can move faster than your lungs. While controlled breathing etc. may provide power, it sacrifices the speed of your arms.

, Everybody is different and has different levels of pain tolerance. Where one point may be on you could be an inch to the left on someone else. Some don't feel it at all. The more people you can practice with, the better you can be at approximating where a point should be and finding it when it's not there.


Tap out. When practicing with a friend, have them tap their thigh loudly to show that you are doing it properly and need to stop. However, they should only tap if it hurts. False confidence doesn't work in a fight.

, Always look directly at your target. If your eyes aren't there, your focus isn't.

, Key things to bear in mind when practicing include:


Use the tips of your fingers and thumbs for techniques using either. This works like a needle, focusing all the force into the very tip of your finger/thumb, multiplying the pressure per square inch (psi). You wouldn't sew with the side of a needle, would you?
Keep your knees bent, at least a little, at all times. More so when doing techniques. This gives you stability and power. Locked knees must be unlocked for you to move, increasing your reaction time. If you're standing straight up, you're like an upright piece of wood, ready to be pushed right over.

, If you're pressing down, bend your knees. If you're pushing forward, step that way or turn your hips towards it.


For greater force when punching, vision the target spot to be slightly further than the real one. (not recommended for training except with the use of a punch pad).
When striking, twist your hips with it. This is a building block of martial arts. It starts your weight moving and is more often than not the source of power in techniques.

, When striking, once you've made contact, pull back quickly. It's almost like bouncing off of what you hit, except you want to recoil quickly enough to prevent the energy you're putting into the target from coming back into your body part. This keeps the energy in the target and causes more damage, especially in bones. This will increase the chance of breaking bones and reduce the chance of the enemy simply grabbing your foot or hand.

, In martial arts (Japanese, anyway), this is known as a kiai. It must come from your diaphragm, truly releasing your inner power. It gives you confidence and startles your attacker. By flexing your abs for it, it also protects your solar plexus. This kiai can be the difference between pressure points working or not.

Train with different partners.",How to Learn Brazilian Jujitsu," If there is none, then try a Judo school. It's the next closest thing.;
, Also, be sure to check out who he or she got their black belt from. They should have a traceable lineage.

, When your first begin to learn BJJ, it will be very frustrating. People larger than you will crush you. People smaller than you will run circles around you. Be patient and take a few hits, it's all part of the learning process

, BJJ is about making techniques automatic to your body (like tying shoe laces).

, Ask your instructor if necessary. Escapes and proper positioning for escapes should be the first thing on a beginners mind. You will be escaping and defending A LOT. Once you feel comfortable, you pick another area to work on.

, For example, today I'm going to class to make sure I do my hip escapes properly. Or, I'm going to class today and working on my mount escapes.

, Competing isn't for everyone, but win or lose, the best part about competing is the preparation for it and the lesson you get while competing. It will help in your development of technique and practical experience.

, This should be the place where you try out techniques against your buddies. This is where you perfect things, put yourself in bad spots to work out of them and just open up your game to expand your BJJ skills. The competitions is where you put it all out there against someone you don't know.

, If you're not having fun, you're doing something wrong.

, Like in every sport, it's a good idea to watch how the professionals do what they do best. Watch the high level BJJ fighters (e.g. Roger Gracie, Cobrinha) to see the things they do. Find a fighter that is most like you and try learn things from them. Live a healthy lifestyle and you will feel great.

, Sometimes it will take you 5 attempts to get a technique and sometime it takes 3 years. The more time you take with a technique, the better it can get.

, Different partners have different strengths, weaknesses, body builds, weight, etc.. working with different partners will help you to analyse what techniques work best for you against a certain body type or partner of a certain weight. Using different partners will also help you to identify which areas of your training that you need to work on. For example: If you train with a particular partner and that partner never tries to take a back mount, then how will you ever improve at defending against back mount offensive techniques?

Place a standing mirror (or, failing that, a long mirror propped against a wall) where you can see yourself as you practice. If needed, place your computer or TV where you can easily see it so you can refer to video tutorials.;
, Go for a quick five-minute jog around the block, do some jumping jacks, or any other light exercise to get the blood flowing. Then do some stretching to limber up so your body is nice and flexible. Finish with some push-ups and sit-ups to wake your body up for some serious action.

, Face the mirror. Spread your feet so they’re three to four feet apart. Sink into a squat until your hips are only a little bit higher than your knees. Straighten your spine by leaning your upper torso slightly backward. Make sure you can see from your hips up to your head in the mirror. It's like sitting in a chair without the chair.


Use the Horse Stance to lower and stabilize your center of gravity when practicing strikes and punches with your arms. Keep your posture straight in order to keep your body and muscles properly aligned.
This stance is intended to be difficult to hold. Practice it in 30 second increments at first with 1-2 minutes rest in between, then try to hold the position for longer and longer.
Practicing your Horse Stance every day will help you quickly strengthen your core and leg muscles and will make you more a powerful and stable martial artist.

, To learn kung fu quickly, stick with the simplest moves. When you first attempt a new strike, move in slow-motion. Concentrate on form. As the movement becomes more natural, requiring less thought on your part, gradually speed up the action from rep to rep until you’re striking with full force. As your endurance builds, increase the number of strikes per rep. Start off with the Straight Punch, one of the most basic moves, if not THE most basic move:With each hand, form a fist with your thumb closed over the outside of your index finger. With your arms close to your sides, draw your fists back alongside your hips with your thumbs facing up. Pull your elbows back and open up your chest.
Strike with one fist. Keep your elbow directly behind it as your arm extends forward. As your elbow straightens out, rotate your fist so its thumb faces down. Leading with that shoulder, draw your other shoulder behind you, twisting from your waist, as you strike. Your shoulders and striking arm should form a straight line aimed at your target upon contact.
Reverse the action. Draw your arm back in, rotating your fist so the thumb faces up again, with your elbow directly behind it as you pull it back. As your first arm draws in and your shoulders realign above your hips, strike with your second arm in the same manner.
Breathe out as your strike. Breathing is an important part of learning kung fu and learning proper breathing technique first will help you advance more quickly through your training.
Use your body's trunk to power your punches. Your power comes from your torso in kung fu and this strike is meant to work these muscles and get you stronger faster. Use the torque gained from pulling back one punch to help fuel the next.

, Face the mirror. Turn your body at a 45 degree angle with left foot and left shoulder forward. Your right foot should behind and to the right of your left. If you're right-handed, this should feel like your natural stance. Get comfortable and don't have your legs more than shoulder length apart. Keep your hands up to protect your head but stay light on your feet.


This stance is akin to a western boxing stance and should also be practiced in reverse (right leg forward). Many (but not all) kung fu styles incorporate this stance.

, With fists closed, try punching straight out with your left hand. Turn your body to the right as you do, stretching your arm and making your shoulders as straight as possible. This punch is often called a ""jab"". Focus on form first, then develop speed and power. Next try a punch from your right. This is often called a ""cross"" because your right fist must ""cross"" your body. Allow yourself to shift on the ball of your right foot as you complete this punch.


If you want to learn fast - go slow and teach your body the form of the movements first. Adding power and speed is easy if you have the form correct. If not, you will be slowing down your progress quite a bit by having to later re-learn correct form.
Practice the full movement each time. Make sure your arm completely straightens out and then resets. Each punch begins and ends with your elbow bent and your hand protecting your head.
Your strength always comes from the center of your body.

, From your fighting stance, imagine another person the same height as you standing directly in front of you is throwing a punch. With your forearm extended use power from your core to move it left or right and connect with the imaginary arm of the punching opponent and move the punch off course. These are called inner and outer blocks.


Inner blocks start at the outside of your body and move inward. Outer blocks do the opposite.
Practice blocking with both arms. Learning kung fu fast is about getting stronger with your dominant and non-dominant sides.

, As with everything else, you'll need to focus first on your body learning the correct form. Kicks may seem intimidating at first but they can be broken down into parts and practiced separately. Learning quickly will depend on how diligent you are about getting your form correct early on and practicing consistently. Begin by practicing these techniques from the fighting stance.The beginning of every kick is to raise your knee to your chest. Bring it as high up towards your shoulder as you can. Practice this movement to become more flexible and practice holding your knee above your hips to gain better balance. At this point, your leg is ""ready to strike"", very similar to having your elbow bent and your fist protecting your head.
For a front kick, the next action is to extend your leg straight forward, pushing from your hip and making sure that the bottom of your foot is striking your intended target and pushing it away from you.
For a side kick, your leg extends forward using power from your hip and your foot still on the ground shifts 90 degrees to accommodate the movement. With this kick, your foot will end horizontal (instead or vertical as with the front kick).
For a roundhouse kick, imagine kicking the hip (or higher up) of your opponent with the top of your foot (the same place you make contact with a soccer ball). You hip still supplies the power but instead of pushing forward the force of the strike will be either left or right (depending on the kicking foot). Your foot still on the ground will shift on its ball 90 degrees to facilitate this striking motion.
With every kick make sure to bring your knee back to your chest after the strike before lowering it. Dropping your leg after a kick is very bad form and will not help you get better faster.
Practice slowly and with good form. Try holding each individual position in the kick (knee up, kick out, reset the knee to your chest) for multiple seconds to imprint the proper movements on your brain. If you practice this way soon it will become second nature to you and your kicks will feel (and appear) as one smooth motion.

, Once you’ve mastered individual moves, practice moving from stance to stance with a strike. Dropping from fighting stance into horse stance can lend extra power to your strikes.To adopt Horse Stance quickly, draw your left knee up to a 90º angle, turning your knee out to your left side, with your left foot drawn in and grazing your right knee. Quickly plant your left foot three to four feet away from your right foot and drop into Horse Stance with both feet pointing forward.

, Once you've got the basic stances and forms down what you need to get better quickly is lots of practice. Staying light on the balls and move around as you punch, kick and block either the air or the punching bag. To build stamina consider practicing in rounds as if you were competing in a tournament (for instance 3 minute round of intense movement followed by a 3 minute break and then repeat).

Is it suffering from too much overhead and waste in the supply chain? Is there inconsistency in how things get done? What's the overall organizational culture?;
, You might be someone who believes that the best way to guarantee quality is to ensure that processes are consistent across the board with as few variations as possible. On the other hand, you might be someone who opts for an emphasis on efficiency or producing a quality product with as little waste and overhead as possible.

, You'll use your management philosophy to decide on whether you'll opt for Six Sigma or Lean Six Sigma certification.Six Sigma defines waste as a variation within business processes. If you're someone who believes in a consistent process, you'd probably be most comfortable with this type of certification.
Lean Six Sigma is a combination of the Lean methodology and the Six Sigma methodology. It defines waste as anything that doesn't add value to the finished product. If you're looking for an emphasis on efficiency, then you'd probably prefer Lean Six Sigma certification.

, Are you a project manager? Are you someone who supports the project manager? Are you someone whose day-to-day work involves more than just being involved on a project that will use Six Sigma? The answer to those questions will determine the level of certification that you need.

, If your future includes project management, even if that's not where you're at now, then that should also help you determine the level of certification that you need.

, There are four levels of Six Sigma certification: Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, and Master Black Belt.Six Sigma Yellow Belts are people who have a basic understanding of the Six Sigma process. They tend to lend themselves in supporting roles to Six Sigma Green Belts and Six Sigma Black Belts. You won't find too many training courses for Six Sigma Yellow Belts.
Six Sigma Green Belts are people who work closely with Six Sigma Black Belts and are primarily responsible for data collection. Usually, Six Sigma Green Belts will have responsibilities outside the Six Sigma project.
Six Sigma Black Belts are project managers. Typically, Six Sigma Green Belts and Six Sigma Yellow Belts report to Six Sigma Black Belts within the scope of the project. These are people who are typically dedicated full time to the project.
Six Sigma Master Black Belts are Six Sigma ""gurus."" They're the experts in a team of highly trained Six Sigma professionals. They're the people that the team will turn to when the unexpected occurs and a course correction may be necessary.

, All certifications start with training, and Six Sigma is no exception. You'll start your certification journey by locating the right training program.


Since classroom instruction is almost always necessary, start by looking for training classes close to you. A simple Google search may be necessary if you have no leads on local Six Sigma training.
Talk to people who have earned Six Sigma certification. Ask them about their experience with the programs that they took. If they've had a positive experience, consider enrolling in the same program.
Look for programs that are accredited. Although there is no formal standards body that defines Six Sigma, there are accreditation organizations. Ensure that you're getting trained by an accredited program., This is going to be just like college all over again. Prepare for some rigorous study and lots of class time, especially if you're opting for Black Belt or Master Black Belt certification.

, Once you've completed the training, the next step is to complete a written test that proves that you've learned what you need to know about Six Sigma.


You can expect a Black Belt exam to last about four hours, a Green Belt exam to last about three hours, and a Yellow Belt exam to last about two hours., The final phase of your certification journey will involve completing one or two projects using the Six Sigma methodology. You can think of this as your ""lab.""


It's subjective at this point as to how to ""grade"" you based on how you complete the project. Just be sure to put into practice what you learned in the classroom and you should do well.

, Once you've completed the training and required coursework, you'll earn your belt. Now, it's time to tackle real-world problems.

At least ten feet by ten feet should be plenty.


If you don't have an empty room you can use, just clear out the corner of a room and remove any object you don't want to break or that you can hurt yourself with.;
, You can hold off on this for a bit, but eventually you'll want a punching bag. At first you'll be doing your moves just in the air, but eventually you'll want to have resistance, which is where a punching bag comes in handy.


You can hang a bag from your ceiling (if the room makes that feasible) or you can purchase a free-standing one at most sporting goods stores.

, Simply put, an actual teacher, or ""sifu,"" is the best way to learn kung fu. But you can also learn kung fu yourself if you're diligent and persevere. Buy some DVDs, watch some videos online, or look at the websites of schools. Many have short videos that offer you a taste of the program, teaching you moves at the same time.


It's best to find more than one source. There a few different schools of kung fu, and you want to make sure you're doing the one that appeals most to you. What's more, there are some people out there that claim to be experts when they're really not. Finding more than one source can help you know that you're doing it correctly.

, There's so much to learn when it comes to kung fu – to tell yourself that you're going to learn everything is quite the tall order. When you're starting off, pick a focus. Once you get a few stances down, do you want to concentrate on jumping? Kicking? Punching?


This makes it easy to write yourself a lesson plan, too. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, say, you'll work on stances and kicks. Then, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you mix it up with core skills, like balance and flexibility.

, In order to hold the stances in kung fu, your balance needs to be in tip top form. What's a good way to master this? Yoga. It may seem like it's unnecessary and keeping you from truly practicing, but what it's really doing is setting you up to be truly great at kung fu.


And as for flexibility, every session should begin with a warm up and stretching session. A warm up can be a light jog, some jumping jacks, and push ups. Then, stretch out your muscles. This not only keeps you injury-free, but it also makes you more flexible, getting your kicks higher and your bends more limber.

, The bare bones of kung fu lies in the stances. You can't deliver the right moves if you're coming from the wrong position. These first three aren't meant for fighting, though – they're meant for traditional kung fu and use with weapons. That being said, they're an integral part of kung fu ideology. Here's a few stances you can work on:



The horse stance. Bend your knees about 30 degrees, widen your feet a bit farther apart than shoulder width, and hold clench fists in at your sides, palms up. Keep your back straight, like you're riding a horse.

The front stance. Bend your knees and draw your left leg back, like you're in a lunge. Then, snap out your right fist in front of you, holding your left fist to your chest. Switch legs, bringing your left in front. As you do so, switch fists, too.

The cat stance. Place your right leg slightly behind you, and lean back on it. Take your left leg and only touch your toes to the ground. Hold both fists as if you're in a resting boxing position, protecting your face. If someone were to come at you, your front leg should be able to automatically come up in defense.

The fighting stance. If you're looking to practice kung fu against others, you'll need the fighting stance. This is essentially the same as a boxing stance – one foot slightly in front of the other, fists up, protecting your face, knees relaxed.

, When it comes to punching, remember that most of the force comes from your hips. Just like in boxing, kung fu has jabs, uppercuts, and hooks. Let's discuss all three.



The jab. In fighter's stance, left foot in front of right foot, bend your knees, turn your hip toward your opponent, and throw out your left fist, immediately followed by your right. As your right comes out, rotate your right hip, too.

The hook. Contrary to intuition, you want your hook to start out small. In fighter's stance, right foot behind, take your right fist, rotate your hip back, and swing strong through to your left, forming a hook shape. Remember, the power is in your hips.

The uppercut. In fighter's stance, lower your fist and bringing it swinging up, as if you're aiming for your opponent's chin directly in front of you. With each uppercut, always twist your hips slightly as this is where your power is coming from.

, Your block will be different depending on what you're blocking. But whatever's coming at you, start with the fighting stance. In this position, you're fully prepared to protect your face and keep attacks from being effective.


For punches, jabs, and hooks, blocking is very similar to boxing. Whichever side is being threatened, take that arm and, keeping it bent, stop your opponent's motion. With your other arm, you can attack.
For kicks and elbows, use both arms. Keep them bent and by your face, but rotate your hips to whatever side is being threatened. This prevents you from hitting your own face upon the backlash and is more painful for them.

, Kicking is one of the funnest aspects of kung fu and also one of the easiest ways to see improvement. Here's three basic kicks you can start with.



The step kick. Stand in front of your punching bag. Take a step forward with your left foot, and then hit the right side of the bag with the inside of your foot. Then, switch to the other side.

The stomp kick. Stand in front of your punching bag. Take a step forward with your left foot, and bring your right foot straight out in front of you, bent at the knee. Then, snap it forward, ""stomping"" on the bag, sending it shooting away from you.

The side kick. Stand in fighter's stance, your left foot in front of your right. Move your weight onto your left foot, swinging out your leg up into the air, hitting the punching bag at shoulder level with the side of your foot. Try to bring your leg in, but stay on your back leg to practice your balance.

, As you're just setting out, start with doing the motions in the air. Once you're consistent and have a grip on the move, switch to doing it with your punching bag. When you start getting worn out, take a break or switch up what you're doing.


Once you get really confident, try to find a friend to spar with. That is, if you have protective gear each other can wear, or pads you can put on the recipient's hands while the other practices their punching and kicks.

, This move is all about being intimidating – the entire time you should be staring at your opponent. Here's how it's done:


Take up the horse stance, but widen your legs a bit farther apart and bending your knees a bit deeper.
Snap out your wrist like a jab, but put your fingers in a claw shape. This would be used to dig into your opponent.
Come out of your squat and do a side kick to your opponent, aiming for their stomach.

, In this pose, you slink backwards, and raise your head up when you're striking, just like a snake. Here's how:


Spread out your legs, right behind your left, resting your weight on your back foot. Keep your knees bent.
Flatten your hands as if you want to slice through your opponent. Snap out your right in front of you.
Block your opponent by grabbing their arm, and launching at them with a stomp kick.

, This move is a little less direct – it allows you the opportunity to flee if need be.


Take up a wide fighter's stance, leaning back on your back leg.
When you're ready to strike, throw your weight forward curl your fingers and hit your opponent with your palm and the ridges of your fingers, instead of your closed fist. However, this must be done very carefully or you could hurt yourself.

, This move is very passive. With the crane, you wait for your opponent to come to you. Here's how it's done:


Take up the cat stance, but with your feet close together. This ""hides"" your foot.
Raise your arms to the sides, distracting your opponent.
As he comes near you, lift up that front foot that has only the toes on the ground and launch into your favorite kick.

, This move is swift, hearty, and effective. Here's how to do it:


Take up a fighter's stance, but wider. You should essentially be in a squat.
Put your hands in front of your shoulders in a claw-shape, facing outwards.
Do a combination jab-jab, and then launch into a side kick at throat level.

, On the days you're not practicing practice, read some of the classic literature on kung fu and combat, such as Sun Tzu, Bruce Lee, Tak Wah Eng, David Chow and Lam Sai Wing. These will teach you about the two schools of kung fu:Shaolin. This is the oldest school of kung fu. This type is known for “external” moves and practices that strengthen muscles, ligaments and tendons. It is what most people think of when they think of kung fu.

Wu Dung. This school is slightly newer and is an interpretation of the original concept of kung fu. It is known for it's “internal” moves and practices that strengthen and manipulate chi or life force. It is more about focus, zen, and internal power.

, In many of these moves, it is helpful to think in terms of animals – this is, after all, the origin of this martial art. It may also put you in the proper mindset and allow you to tap into your potential.


There is a story that says a man from New Zealand once dug a 3 feet (0.9 m) deep hole and practiced jumping in and out of it. Over time he dug deeper and, little by little, he turned into a humanoid kangaroo. Not only should you think of animals when you're combating, but when you're practicing, too.

, Japanese samurai used meditation to enhance their fighting skills. They believed (and rightfully so) that it gave them clarity and helped them see what the right attack would be. It allowed their minds to clear and for everything to slow down. The same is still true today. Just 15 minutes or so a day of meditation may help you find inner balance and power.


Think of being in a car accident. While it's happening, everything just sort of slows down. This is the state of meditation. This peaceful, zen state can be useful in fighting because everything becomes slower, allowing you to react faster.

, The only way to truly get in the mind of a kung fu artist is to keep practice. Alone, the moves may seem silly. You may seem like you're not getting anywhere. But if you practice every day, meditate, and are reading literature, it can become a way of life you can't believe you ever lived without.


Try practicing in the air, against a punching bag, and sparring with a friend. Seek out the next challenge as you get better and better.
Always fix yourself and make constant corrections. Review your source material and make sure you're doing it correctly. Otherwise, you're not truly doing kung fu.

Find a training partner.,
Toughen yourself up.,
Strengthen your core.,
Develop your arms.,
Work on your legs.",How to Learn Kung Fu Fast2," A quick way to get better and challenge yourself it to train with a partner. You'll be psychologically driven harder and longer in your workouts.


A partner can also help you get better by holding pads for you, and vice versa. By kicking and punching pads you'll develop your strength and stamina much faster than shadowboxing or hitting a heavy bag alone.
Holding the pads for a partner is also a good way to develop your hand and foot work and should not be discounted as good practice. Learning different combinations of punches and kicks from both sides of he pad is important and holding the pads will also help you stay loose until the striking moment.

, There are many ways to make your fists, forearms, and feet stronger. Realize that apart from technique, speed, and strength, your body needs to get more accustomed to hitting and getting hit.


On your own simply hitting a heavy bag may be an effective toughening exercise, especially when it comes to roundhouse kicks and connecting with the top of your foot. Go lightly at first and focus on getting the form right, then as your foot gets a bit tougher try hitting the bag with strength.
With a partner try strengthening your forearms with a common blocking exercise. Stand face to face or in a horse stance if you're comfortable, then extend your right arm with your hand pointed downward in an inner block. Your partner will do the same and your forearms will collide (lightly at first) as a way to practice the block. Next rotate your right arm clockwise 180 degrees. You partner will do the same and your forearms will connect again. Now rotate your right arm 180 degrees counterclockwise again for a third connection. Now try the exact same thing with your left arms and repeat again and again. Make sure you're getting torque from the rotation of your torso.
Fist pushups (or knuckle pushups - even tougher) may be a good way to strengthen your fists.

, Improve your ability to draw strength from the ground into your strikes. Increase the amount of force that you deliver with your kicks. Focus not only on your abs (which is only one part of your core) but the sides and back of your waist as well. Core-strengthening exercises include:Planks
Traditional and reverse sit-ups
Drawing your knees up to your chest while hanging from a pull-up bar or while in the pushup position (these are sometimes called ""mountain climbers"")

, Wear wrist-weights when you practice your kung fu. Exercise your arms with traditional methods on a daily basis. Do push-ups, pull-ups, curls, etc. Give extra attention to your forearms, which will improve your ability to grapple with opponents.An “easy” way to strengthen your forearms is to simply do fist-clenches with your arms held out straight in front of you.

, Solid footing and powerful legs are very important in any martial art, so make sure you strengthen your legs. Wear leg-weights when you practice your kung fu moves. Make a daily routine of doing squats, squat jumps, and step-ups.Other quality leg exercises include: toe jumps, frog jumps, Cossack jumps, one-legged jumps, duck walks, and sprints.

Research different kung fu styles.,
Watch online tutorials.,
Adopt the kung fu mindset.",How to Learn Kung Fu Fast3," Compare and contrast the teachings and philosophy of each practice. For long-term goals, consider which one emphasizes areas that you wish to develop both mentally and physically. To learn kung fu quickly, however, choose one that already plays to your strengths.The two most prominent schools are Wu Dong and Shaolin. In Wu Dong, the emphasis is on the “internal” with the aim of developing your chi (life force). Shaolin focuses on the “external” with exercises that strengthen your body.
Kung fu styles are further distinguished by the geography of their origins. Northern styles tend to incorporate a lot of leg work and acrobatics. Southern styles, on the other hand, emphasize solid footing and more arm work.
Another distinction between styles is hard versus soft. Hard styles teach you to meet your opponent with equal or greater force, while soft styles rely more on using your opponent’s momentum to their disadvantage.

, See exactly how your body is supposed to move and orient itself to execute moves and stances correctly. Begin with basic moves like kicks and punches. Then watch how these individual moves are incorporated into longer katas (choreographed exercises that combine a variety of movements).


Watch each clip multiple times. Each time, pay close attention to just one area of the demonstrator’s body. Focus on their feet in one viewing. Then focus on their hips. Then their waist. And so on. This way, when you practice it yourself and, say, strike with your arms, you’ll know exactly how your feet and legs should be reinforcing your body so you can deliver your strike with the most efficiency.
To further expand your understanding of kung fu, also watch clips of other martial arts to see how they differ. Note how kung fu appears more fluid in motion. utilizing more circular techniques than are found in other arts, like karate, where movements are more direct and linear., Even though you want to learn kung fu quickly, resist the temptation to train too hard too fast. Although kung fu aims to instill discipline in those who practice it, it doesn’t expect it from you right away, so relax. Forget “no pain, no gain.” Build a training schedule sensibly, according to your capabilities and overall fitness, in order to avoid injury or burning yourself out.For example, instead of practicing 100 kicks right off the bat, start off with reps of 10 kicks spread across the course of the day. Learn how to execute correctly and efficiently without tiring yourself out. Then, once you’ve mastered how to execute a kick, build your endurance by gradually increasing the number of kicks per rep: from 10 to 15; from 15 to 20; from 20 to 30; and so on.

Jog.",How to Get a Good Work out with Punching Bag," If you are not ready to invest in your own heavy bag, find a local gym that has the equipment you need. Do you prefer the convenience of working out at home? There are lots of heavy bags on the market. Research heavy bags and read reviews in order to find the one that will work best for you.;
, Grab a stopwatch. Your phone, watch, or even the egg timer from your kitchen will work. You will use the timer throughout the workout to time your warm-up, rounds, and cool-down.

, Skipping or jumping rope is an excellent way to warm-up. Purchase a jump rope or use the old jump rope stored away in your garage. If you are working out at your local gym, ask an employee to help you locate a jump rope at the facility., Protect your knuckles, loose ligaments, joints, and the bones in your hands with a wrap. Hand wraps are single strips of semi-elastic cloth with a thumb loop on one end and a piece of velcro on the other end. They come in a variety of colors, widths, lengths, and styles. You will need one wrap for each hand. Roll up your hand wrap so that the thumb loop is on the end.

, Beginning with the back of your hand, as opposed to the palm of your hand, prevents the wrap from loosening up when you make a fist. Wrap your wrist three times, keeping the wrap below the thumb loop. Position the wrap above the thumb loop and wrap the palm of your hand three times.

, Position the hand wrap diagonally along the palm of your hand--from the base of your pinky to the base of your thumb. Bring the wrap around the base of your thumb and between your pinky and ringer fingers. Pull the wrap between your pointer finger and thumb, positioning the wrap diagonally across the back of your hand. The wrap should form a “X” on the back of your hand. Move the wrap back to the base of your thumb. Form a second “X” by pulling the wrap between your middle and ring fingers in the same manner. Form a third “X” by pulling the wrap between your middle and index finger in the same manner. End this process with the wrap positioned at the base of your thumb.


This separates the fingers.

, Wrap your thumb once. Pull the wrap across the back of your hand and around your wrist to the base of your thumb. Pull the wrap halfway around the thumb. Instead of going around the thumb, pull the wrap across the palm of your hand at the base of your fingers. The hand wrap WILL change directions.


This locks the thumb in place and secures the hand wrap.
Wrap the knuckles. Pull the hand wrap around your knuckles three times. If you have extra length on your hand wrap, you may either wrap the knuckles additional times or make “Xs” around the back of your hand.
Make sure the wrap doesn’t become too thick--you still need to put your gloves on!

, Finish wrapping your hands at your wrist and secure the velcro. This provides additional wrist support., Start your warm up with joint rotations in order to lubricate your joints and prepare them for the work out. Start by making circles with your feet. Work your way up to the knees, hips, and shoulders Finish by rotating your wrists.


Rotate your ankles by moving them in small circles. You can rotate them clockwise or counterclockwise. This can be done seated or standing.
To lubricate your knee joints, come to a standing position. Pull your right knee up towards your chest. Release it back to the ground. Pull your left knee up towards your chest. Release it back down. Repeat as needed.
Lubricate your hips by completing single leg rotations. Stand near a wall or workout bench for balance. Anchor your left foot on the ground. Rest your hand on the wall or bench for support. Raise your right leg up, bend the knee to the 90 degrees. Rotate your raised leg, moving your knee from the front to the side. Repeat with the left leg.
To warm-up your shoulders, begin with small shoulder shrugs. Transition from shrugging your shoulders to rotating your arms in clockwise circles, followed by counterclockwise circles.
Move your wrists in a clockwise motion. Switch to a counterclockwise motion after approximately 30 seconds., Skip rope for at least 5 minutes, aiming to increase the number of jumps-in-a-row as you go. Skipping is an excellent, low-impact activity. It increases your blood circulation, raises your core body temperature, and elevates your heart rate. It also helps you work on your coordination, which is an important component of bag training and boxing.If there is a bike or a treadmill available to you, bike or jog instead of jumping rope.

, Complete your warm-up with a light stretch. Begin by stretching the muscle groups in the lower half of your body--your calves, hamstrings, and lower back. Move onto your upper body. Stretch your core, upper back, arms, and neck. Spend a little extra time stretching muscles that are particularly sore.To stretch your calves, stand approximately two feet from a wall. Facing the wall, rest your hands on the wall for support. Flex your right foot--press the ball of your foot against the wall while keeping your heel anchored on the ground. Lean into the wall to increase the stretch. Repeat with your left foot.Tight hamstrings can be pesky! Stretch your hamstrings by touching your toes. You can complete this stretch from a seated or standing position.To stretch your lower back, stand with your hands at your sides. Lean to the right and slide your right hand down your leg. Hold for 10 seconds. Come back to a normal standing position. Repeat on the left side.Stretch your core and upper back at the same time. Position yourself on all fours (use a towel or yoga mat for additional padding). Start with a straight back. Keeping your head up, inhale and arch your back. Exhale and round your spine. Repeat as needed.
Stretch your arms. Pull your right arm diagonally across the front of your torso. With your left arm, come underneath your right arm. Bend your left elbow and position your right arm in the crook of your left arm. Repeat with your left arm.
To stretch your neck, come to a seated position. Intertwine your fingers and rest your palms on the back of your head. Tuck your chin into your chest. Press your hands towards your thighs. Release and repeat as needed., Heavy bag gloves are used exclusively for training. They have just enough padding to protect your hands during your vigorous workout. Purchase a high-quality pair of leather gloves with velcro fasteners--don’t skimp! Heavy bag gloves are for everyday use. Gloves made of better material--quality leather and molded foam padding--will last longer and provide better protection to your hands., Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. If you are right-handed, shift the left side of your body forward towards the bag and lift the heel of your right foot. If you are left-handed, shift the right side of your body forwards towards the bag and lift the heel of your left foot. Maintain a slight bent in the knees. Pull your hands up towards your face while keeping your shoulders and elbows down.

, When completing drills, you will not remain static in the starting stance. You will circle the bag. Walk around the bag--don’t jump or cross your feet. Keep a slight bend in the knees and your hands up by your face.

, The key to a safe and effective heavy bag workout is to hit the bag, not push the bag. Instead of throwing a pushing punch--meaning you are attempting to push your hand all the way through your target--you should throw snap punches while training.Snap punches allow you to conserve energy while hitting harder and moving faster. When throwing a snap punch, your wrist will snap back from the impact of hitting the bag.

, Assume the starting stance. Make a fist, placing the thumb on the outside of your hand. If you are right-handed, extend your left arm forward; if you are left-handed, extend your right arm forward. As you extend, keep your wrist straight and your elbow slightly bent. Draw the arm back to the starting position.

, You will throw the cross with your power hand--your dominant hand. Assume the starting position. Pivot on the heel of your dominant foot and rotate the leg and the hip. As you rotate, extend your arm. Your dominant arm should retain a slight bent at the elbow. Keep the opposite hand near your face for protection. Draw the arm, hip, leg, and heel back to the starting position.

, Assume the starting stance. Pivot on the heel of your non-dominant foot. Turn through the leg and hip. As you pivot, extend your non-dominant arm horizontally across your body. Elevate your elbow slightly. Hold your dominant hand near your face for protection. Draw the arm back to the starting position., The 1-2 combo is a series of two linked punches. First, through the jab. Immediately after returning to the starting stance, throw a cross. Draw the arm back to the starting position.

, The 1-2-3 combo is a series of three linked punches. Like the 1-2 combo, you will first throw a jab. This will be followed by a hook. The last punch in the series is a cross.

, Complete a series of timed rounds (8 rounds x 3 minutes, with 1 minute rest in between) and focus on your footwork. In rounds 1 and 2, circle the bag to the right, feeding a jab for every one to two steps you take. In rounds 3 and 4, circle the bag to the left, feeding a cross punch, a straight lined punch with your dominant hand, for every one to two steps. In rounds 5 and 6, circle the bag to the right and feed a 1-2 combo per every one to two steps. In rounds 7 and 8, circle the bag to the left and complete a 1-2-3 combo per every one to two steps.The goal of footwork drills is to practice moving with the bag instead of waiting for it to return to you.
Walk with the bag--move with it and stay loose to avoid hopping around the bag in a stiff stance.
Keep the bag an arms length away from you.

, Complete a series of timed rounds (6 rounds x 3 minutes, with 1 minute rest in between) while focusing on improving your speed. Stand 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) distance from the bag. Divide each round into 15 second intervals. In rounds 1 and 2, explode forward towards the bag in a lunge motion and jab the bag for fifteen seconds. Rest for 15 seconds and repeat until the round is over. During rounds 3 and 4, execute the same drill but substitute the jab with a 1-2 combo. Complete the same drill in rounds 5 and 6, substituting the 1-2 combo with a hook punch.


Don’t focus on your technique during speed drills--work on contracting your muscle quickly instead of perfecting your form.
Bend your knees throughout the drill to avoid locking your joints.
Focus on your breathing. Short, small breaths will help increase the speed of your hands.

, Another way to improve your speed is to use a speed bag, a small punching bag. Stand less than an arm’s length away from the speed bag with squared shoulders. Adjust the bag’s height until the bottom is level with your eyes. Keep both hands near the bag. Hit the bag with an open hand--this affords you more control over the bag--and move your hands in a small circles. Hit the bag twice with your right hand, followed by two hits with your left hand (RIGHT-RIGHT-LEFT-LEFT). Continue this pattern for an entire round.


Speed bags rebound after you hit them. Before hitting the bag again, let it rebound three times--FORWARDS-BACKWARDS-FORWARDS., The power behind your punch is derived from good technique. Complete a series of timed rounds (3 minutes each, with 1 minute rest in between) and focus on punching the bag with power. Circle the bag and execute combos (1-2 combo or 1-2-3 combo). Try to hit the bag with 80% to 95% power output. Focus on the power of delivery and back it up with as much momentum and weight as possible. Repeat this drill as you feel fit., Complete a series of timed rounds (15 rounds x 2 minutes, with 1 minute rest in between) while working on enhancing your stamina. Find someone to hold the bag for you. In rounds 1 through 5, stand 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) distance from the bag. Explode against the bag with a combo of continuous jabs. During rounds 6 through 10, repeat this drill and substitute jabs with crosses. In rounds 11 through 15, repeat the drill. Substitute crosses for 1-2 combos.Don’t hit with too much power--instead of working on how hard you can hit focus on increasing the number of punches you can complete in one round.
Breath with every punch.
Keep your knees bent and your shoulders square.

, Take 5 minutes to perform some arm circles to help the circulation remove the excess lactic acid that may have formed and accumulated in the muscles. This will help your muscles recover faster. Repeat the rotation exercises from the warm-up.

, Slowly stretch your back, shoulder, triceps, and abdominal muscles. This will help minimize the training soreness and speed recovery., Run slowly for 5 minutes. This will help flush out the lactic acid that built up in your legs. Jogging after a strenuous workout can speed your recovery time.

Remember to follow through with your arm.",How to Knock Someone Out with One Hit1," If you are going to strike with your right hand, then your left leg should be in front of your other leg. Keep your knee slightly bent and your left leg back. Feel a loose bounce in the stance.;
, Pull your right elbow in close to your body with your fist clenched as if you are about to punch. Your body should be facing to the right. Then, practice twisting your upper body to face your opponent. This will give your punch more force.









, Right before you throw the punch, tighten your body. Remember to breathe. This will focus your body and tighten your muscles releasing more power. Also it keeps you calm and this will help in the event of a continued confrontation.









, Hitting your opponent in the jaw or chin is more likely to cause a knockout.There are one of two ways you can hit the jaw:











Uppercut. This is where you target the jaw with your fist by coming straight up, minimizing lateral movement. You want the recipient's head to snap straight up.

Sideswipe. This is where you target the jaw with your fist by coming from the side. You want the recipient's head to snap to the side, causing a blackout.

, Remember that you will generate more force with a hit by twisting your hips while you move into the target. Baseball players also use this strategy to generate more force when they swing the bat.









, Your goal is to clip the target's jaw from the bottom or on the side. If performing the Sideswipe, make sure your range of motion is a bit curved. You want the path of your punch to be more circular than linear.

Whatever you choose to wear, you'll want it to provide free range of motion without being loose enough to entangle yourself or allow your opponent to easily grab a hold of you.


Simple gym gear might be suitable for your martial arts training. A pair of athletic shorts and a t-shirt won't get in your way and will provide minimal chances for an opponent to grab on to.
Traditional martial arts training gear, often called a gi in English (pronounced gee; ぎ / 着), can be bought online or at specialty martial arts stores. These are specifically designed for durability and use in training.;
, If your muscles are stiff, it could negatively impact your ability to adopt the proper stance and pull off even simple moves. Consider taking a warm up jog so you're body is fully ready to practice your art and be sure you stretch all your muscles thoroughly.


Some studies have shown that you cannot get the best stretch without warming up first. Other warm up activities include push ups, sit ups, jumping jacks, bicycling, and more.
Warming up and stretching could also prevent you from straining yourself while practicing your Jeet Kune Do. Straining your muscles before you are ready could result in a pulled muscle., The lead step stance is an active body position that limits potential strikes to your body while enabling you to defend or attack easily. The key feature of the lead step is its thrust. All motion and force should begin with your back leg, extending through your body and into whatever move you try. Body alignment is an important part of any martial art stance. This will reinforce whatever stance you take. A bent back will negatively impact your balance and limbs unaligned at joints will be more prone to sprains, strains, and breaks.
Always try to limit the potential for counters and strikes in your stance. Provide your opponent as few of targets as possible by angling your body to him so one of your sides, and not your front or back, faces him as often as possible.
Especially when training with a partner, but also in real life scenarios, it's important to coordinate your motion with your opponent. Train your reflexes so that you begin your attacks/blocks to coincide with your opponent. This will limit his ability to respond or change his approach., The thrust of all your martial movements will begin in your back leg, extending through your body and target.A common mistake of novices is to aim at the target and not through it. This, however, will limit the force with which you hit since you'll be stopping your strike at the surface of the target. To ensure you hit with the full brunt of your blow, always punch through your target to the space beyond it.


Since the goal of most martial arts is to train you for self-defense in potentially dangerous situations, you should train your reflexes to have the greatest effect. This means you'll have to break bad habits, like stopping your strike preemptively at the surface of your target.
While training, you'll should always begin with slow, precise, concentrated movements. This will prevent you from hurting your training partner or yourself if you are practicing on a heavy back or some other kind of equipment. As your precision and muscle memory improves, you can begin to speed up your motions., If you don't know which foot is dominant, you can find this out by performing a simple test. Stand with your feet should width apart and begin to lean forward until you fall. The foot you catch yourself with is generally your dominant foot. You'll also want to...


Have the left or right side of your body facing your target/opponent, never the front or back. Facing a real life opponent with the front or back of your body will open up many vulnerable points, like your stomach and groin.
Coordinate your dominant foot with the side of your body. If your dominant foot in your right foot, face your opponent with the right side of your body. If your dominant foot is your left, face him with the left side of your body.
Experienced martial artists are able to change fluidly between leftward/rightward orientation. However, this can be awkward for beginners. It may take time and practice before you are comfortable leading with your non-dominant side., Angle your lead foot slightly toward the front of your body. You want your lead foot to mostly face your target/opponent, but by turning your foot slightly inward toward your body, your body will naturally be oriented in a way that limits you from presenting vulnerable points on your body., Standing flat footed will create an imbalanced stance, and standing too far forward on your feet will do the same. Your weight should be concentrated at a point slightly behind the balls of your feet, and your knees should have a small bend. Your rear leg should be a little more bent than your front, and your legs should be roughly shoulder width apart.


Your back leg being the place where the force of your strike originates in lead step stance, should be more active than your front. This means that your weight will be distributed on your rear foot a little farther forward than that of your front, resulting in a slightly raised heel.
Bending your legs too much, often referred to as a ""deep stance,"" will make it difficult for you to spring into action. A neutral, at-the-ready stance will prepare you best to be like water and meet whatever situation may come., Bend your arms so that each is close to your body. Leading too far with your front hand will give opponents the ability to slap your hand out of the way, compromising your stance. Your front hand should be at about chin level a small distance in front of you. Your back hand should be at about the same position, placed so that it is at or slightly below chin level.You may want to curl your hands into fists so that you are ready to punch, or you may want a more defensive open-hand position. Either of these work well with lead step stance., To execute most moves, you'll have to bend your elbows and knees, transferring your weight and motion into the force of a strike or block. However, a well-aligned limb will withstand force better, protecting you from sprains, strains, and breaks. In particular, you should...


Keep your back straight, your shoulders down (don't hunch), and relax your body. Generally, your posture should be tall without being strained, straight without being overextended, and at ease without being lazy. Your head should be down, but your eyes should be up.
Keep your hands aligned with your forearms. Striking an opponent/target with a bent wrist is likely to do as much damage to you as your target., The motion should be like pushing off, though in a straight blow you should not actually bring your back foot off the surface of the floor. Losing contact with the ground will compromise your stability and create openings for your opponent.


You can think of a straight blow in lead step stance as a way of pushing your front foot forward with your rear foot. This will naturally transfer the force of the motion from your back leg through your body and into your strike., Continue with the thrust of the motion starting in your rear foot and step forward with your front. The slight bend in your back leg will straighten to accommodate the step forward, but should not move from its starting position or come off the floor.








Your front knee will have to increase its bend as you step forward. This deepening of your stance will elongate your forward/backward position so that it extends from the starting position all the way to your target.
Do not step forward too far, as this will compromise your stance. Poor starting position can lead you to overextending yourself, creating an unstable, extra deep stance. If your target is too far away, reposition yourself closer to it.
When repositioning, you should make use of a shuffle step. Advance first with your lead foot and follow with your rear. At no point should you ever cross your feet; this will create a severely weakened stance., Imagine the path of the force of your strike traveling through the point of contact and extending in a straight line beyond it. This will ensure you do not prematurely stop your strike at the surface of your target and lessen the force of your strike.







, While getting used to striking from the lead step stance, you might lose balance and fall one way or another. As you learn the mechanics of the move, your balance should improve and your stance should become very solid. After extending to strike, return to the starting position by drawing your front foot backward until you are again in ready stance.


Maintaining contact with the floor has many purposes. For one thing, when your foot is raise, you have nothing to push against or balance upon, making this position naturally weak. Also, in a real-life scenarios, there can be dangerous debris on the ground, like glass or nails, that can puncture footwear and put you at a disadvantage.
To practice keeping your feet in contact with the floor, you might want to train returning to ready stance by sliding your front foot back until you are in position. In real life, this sliding motion would likely push dangerous debris out of the way., Stepping to the left from lead step stance will put you to the inside (the direction your front is facing) of potential strikes from your adversary, making it easy to slip around the approaching blow of your opponent. As you do so, you will perform a strike simultaneous with the motion of your opponent's strike.Many untrained opponents will not be able to effectively coordinate offense and defense at the same time. Attacking in the same moment your opponent does means he will likely be unready to defend himself from your blow.

, There are many signs and signals that will alert you when an opponent is about to strike. Watch for body tension, arm movement like a wind-up or pulling back motion, and more. The more you train, the finer your sense for these signals will become.









Your goal should be to begin your strike at the same time your opponent does, although accomplishing this perfectly will likely be impossible in the real world. Launching your own strike in sync with your opponent's own will give him little time to respond., Keep the angle of your foot pointing slightly inward toward your body. You should only step to the inside a little bit, and you should try to present as little of your body to your opponent as you do so. This will protect you from counters or desperate attacks/flailing. Even if you land a decisive blow, your opponent could reflexively lash out a foot to your groin, negating your advantage.









You should move your head to duck around the strike of your opponent. It is common to lean your head forward slightly as your body extends forward into a strike.
Remember that the thrust of this motion is based in your rear leg. You should push your front leg forward by driving down with your rear leg while keeping it in contact with the ground.
Many martial experts advocate accomplishing as much as you can to your advantage with a single move. When your opponent is striking, he won't likely be thinking about his own foot work. You can effectively trap his foot and ruin his balance by covering the front of his foot with your own, trapping it there., When striking with your leading hand, your rear hand takes on the role of defender. To prevent a lucky hit against you or a glancing blow, you can ""cover"" your opponent's oncoming strike with your rear hand. In many cases, a gentle slap can completely knock the oncoming strike off course.








A more advanced technique you might want to consider when you have mastered the basics is a basic parry. A parry is where you stop/block a strike with a strike of your own. In this case, as you strike your opponent and he attempts to strike you, you can attack his striking limb with your rear hand, accomplishing the dual purpose of knocking his strike off course while doing damage., In the same way you delivered a straight blow from lead step stance, extend your arm with the force of your motion and punch through your target. After you have landed your blow, return to ready stance.







, Drive with your rear leg and step to the outside (the direction your back is facing). You will likely need to duck your head a little bit, but the motion of stepping to the outside will take you off the line of attack of your opponent's strike., Your step to the outside will orient your body so that your lead arm is in an unsuitable position to strike. Instead, extend your rear arm to your target, punching through it in the same way you would with your lead arm when delivering a straight blow in lead step stance.








Twist your torso as you strike with your rear hand. This will not only facilitate the transference of force, but will also limit potential targets for your opponent.
This strike is very versatile. You can aim your blow up to the face or down to the groin. Practice striking various locations to prepare yourself for any scenario., The position you will be in after striking with your rear hand will be ideal for a follow up strike with your right arm. In particular, this position is strongly suited to a right hook.







, This is especially important when implementing a cross blow. The goal of a cross is to travel over the line of attack of your opponent, effectively crossing your arm over your opponent's., This is a very similar motion as you would do when stepping to the left and striking from lead step stance. You should move your head so that you slip around the blow of your opponent as you step forward.








Remember, the force of your lead step strikes originates in your rear foot. Always drive the motion of your strikes with your rear leg., Your arm should slip over the arm of your opponent, ""crossing"" it. Your strike should trace the line of your opponent's strike closely without being influenced by it. Hitting your opponent's arm may knock your strike off course, resulting in a glancing or poorly placed blow. Being too distant from the line of your opponent's attack will force the motion of your arm to the outside, misdirecting some force from your blow.







, You'll want to step off the line of attack of your opponent to give yourself time and space to execute your kick. Slide your back foot to the outside and follow it with your front. This motion is the approximate reverse of your step to the right strike. Immediately adopt the ready stance for the lead step stance.








You will want to synchronize your step to the outside with the forward strike of your opponent. His strike will likely continue where you were, putting him in a disadvantageous body position to respond to your blow., Keep your hands in position in case your opponent attempts a follow up strike. Balance on your rear leg and kick out with your front. This kind of strike can be both an attack or a defensive response to the action of your opponent.








You can aim you kick high or low depending on what the situation dictates. Kicking requires excellent balance and weight distribution to prevent imbalance. You'll likely have to practice this move frequently to perform it well., The higher the kick, the more you will need to balance on your rear leg. This can compromise the strength of your stance, as you will only have one limb to support yourself. High kicks will also open your body to counter-blows.


A failed high kick could open your groin or torso to deadly counters. In life-or-death situations, you may want to stick to a more conservative fighting style."

, When choosing the best martial art to learn, keep your current physical condition in mind. For older adults who aren’t used to strenuous exercise, tai chi offers health benefits without putting too much stress on the body. It involves slow, deliberate movements and deep breathing, and classes are typically available in most areas.Tai chi can improve joint health, flexibility, concentration, coordination, stress management, and aerobic health.Since it’s non-competitive and low impact, it might not be the best choice if self defense is a priority or if you’re at a higher level of fitness.

, Kung fu focuses on balance and incorporates relaxation techniques, so it’s a great way to improve coordination and concentration. It’s not the best choice if you have slow reflexes, since it primarily incorporates rapid strikes and quick forward motions.While it’s great for the forearms and upper body, it doesn’t involve many kicks. If you’re looking for a full body workout, you might want to consider another option.

, Muoy Thai is a form of kickboxing, and includes knee, elbow, fist, and foot strikes. It might be a good choice if you’re at a higher fitness level and flexible to begin with, and is a demanding, full body endurance test.Once you’ve learned how to execute strikes, sparring becomes a standard part of training. This makes it a good choice if self defense is high on your priority list.
Muoy Thai can be tough on the shoulders and hips, so you’ll want to go with another option if you have a history of problems with these joints.

, Commonly referred to as “hard” arts, karate, Judo, and Jiu Jitsu are becoming common choices for older adults. Recent studies have shown that they can enhance attention, resilience, and motor reaction.Since they’re so popular, these are the best choices if tournament competition is of any interest to you. While each are good choices for self defense, Judo is the most practical option of the three if defense is your primary goal.It’s best if you’re already in good health before signing up for a more demanding martial art form. You can also find a local karate class tailored for older adults at a more modest fitness level to avoid routines that are too strenuous or otherwise uncomfortable.

, Since Tae Kwon Do has the most practitioners and is such a broad form, you should take a little extra time to learn about a particular class before enrolling. Ask a potential instructor how they train their students and what their focuses are. Some instructors will emphasize relaxation techniques and cardiovascular exercises, while others will stress sparring or breaking objects like boards and bricks.Go for a class that centers on sparring if you’re looking to learn self defense. Choose an instructor who stresses aerobic exercises and concentration techniques if you want to improve your overall health.
Sparring in Tae Kwon Do typically involves full gear, so it can also be a costlier commitment.
Since so many people practice this martial art, it’s a great choice if you’re interested in tournament competition.

, In addition to punches, kicks, and other strikes, Krav Maga involves practical skills like disarming an attacker. It also involves groin kicks, throat punches, and other strikes that are banned in other martial art forms. These attributes make it the best choice of all for self defense, but be sure you’ll have bruises at the end of every class.You won’t have much luck finding a Krav Maga tournament, so go with another choice if competition is on your list of goals.

Be in a fighting position with this person.,
Turn around, stepping away from them, pulling them towards you (this throws off their balance), and grab their arm.,
Roll them off of your hip.,
Once they are on the ground make sure they slap the floor as they hit to prevent friction.",How to Flip Someone over Your Shoulder," Have your hands on their shoulders and their hands on your shoulders. Make sure that your hands are inside. (This is a general description and will need to be adapted in any real fight situation.);
, Place your bottom into their hips, bend over, squat, and lift, while pulling their arm forward. You should be able to hold them on your hips.

, Flipping them straight over your back or high into the air gives them a chance to recover and land or their feet or in some other stabilized position. It also has a great chance of straining your back if done improperly. You want to drop them from hip height, before they can right themselves. The goal is to let the ground knock the wind out of them.


Trained people can counteract this by releasing a kiai and knowing how to break their fall.

, Do Not Let Go of them until they have been on the floor for about two seconds. (This could alternatively be taught as STRIKE THEM AS SOON AS THEY ARE ON THE FLOOR or GET AWAY FROM THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.)

, As you gain momentum, make sure your body is relaxed. It will increase your momentum and the force of your hit.









, The temple is the area on the side of a person's face, between the hairline and the eyebrows, at eye level. If the temple is accurately targeted, the punch will cause the brain to swing violently against the skull lining, causing a blackout., It's sometimes easier to use the palm of your hand for hitting, but in this case a fist is more accurate. Aiming at the side of the person's face, and hitting them from the side, is extremely hard to do with force when only using the palm.









, Generate more force with a hit by twisting your hips while you move into the target. If you want to put more force into your swing, be sure to use your hips as well as your arms.

, You can use your index finger and middle finger to ""stab"" your opponent in the throat. To get your fingers into position, pretend that you are doing the peace sign with both fingers on the same hand.Then, bring the fingers together so that they are touching each other. Afterwards, firm up your fingers and prepare to strike.

Consult your doctor.,
Consider health benefits.,
Focus on health and fun instead of defense.,
Set realistic and specific goals.",How to Learn Martial Arts As an Older Adult2," Learning a martial art can be demanding exercise, so be sure to consult your doctor as you choose an appropriate form of study. Ask your doctor or other medical professional if your heart and lungs are up to the task. Make sure to first seek a professional opinion if you are pregnant or have a history of severe joint issues, osteoporosis, hernia, or other significant medical conditions.Ask your doctor, ""Is my heart healthy enough for aerobic exercise? Am I at a higher risk of a heart attack or other heart-related conditions if I enroll in a martial arts class?""
If you have arthritis or a history of joint problems ask, ""Will a martial arts class that focuses on stretching and flexibility improve my condition? What steps should I take to modify any movements to avoid pain and worsening my condition?""
If your health and age are concerns, ask your doctor if a class that modifies techniques to make them easier would be more appropriate than a standard class. Ask them if they can refer to you to a good instructor for your physical considerations., Be patient and realistic when you’re setting your goals, and try not to stress yourself out as you decide a form of study. Keep in mind there’s plenty of evidence that suggests learning any martial art at all offers positive mental and physical health effects.You should base your goals on having fun, what you’re most likely to commit to, and what is best for your level of fitness. If you don’t enjoy a particular form of study, class, or instructor, just shop around for another. Don’t be upset with yourself if you’re uncomfortable or have trouble learning a technique.
Studies show that, when it comes to neurological benefits like visual acuity and concentration, it doesn’t matter which form of study you pursue. Learning any martial art form will offer results.Similarly, all martial art forms can be more beneficial for middle aged and elderly adults than other forms of exercise, like walking.The crucial factor is that you find something appropriate for your individual body that you enjoy enough to commit to over a matter of months or years.

, It’s typically best to think of learning defensive techniques as a bonus, rather than focus on self defense alone. Setting goals too high, like expecting to be a defensive powerhouse in a month, can lead to frustration and quitting your studies. Further, if you’re not physically up to the task, taking on a martial art form that stresses defense and sparring can pose serious injury risks., With so many forms of study available, think about what you want to achieve when choosing a class. Make a written list if it helps you order your thoughts better, and consider how you prioritize goals like weight loss, flexibility, concentration, defense, and competition.Ask yourself, ""Do I just need a hobby or activity for personal enjoyment? Do I want something easy going and fun, or do I want a class that will challenge me, help me lose weight, and improve my overall health? How important is competition to me? Do I want to be ready for competition within a certain period of time?""
Commit to specific goals, such as achieving a higher belt level within a month, losing ten pounds in six weeks, or competing in a tournament within six months. Talk to your trainer or instructor to help you develop specific personal goals.

Avoid getting injured.,
Choose classes over videos or books.,
Take classes with a friend or neighbor.,
Make a long-term commitment for best results.",How to Learn Martial Arts As an Older Adult3," Injury is among the most common reasons why people abandon an exercise routine. Only sign up for a class after you’ve consulted both your doctor and the potential instructor about choosing a martial art form. Once you enroll, take precautions not to overexert yourself.Ask your instructor to modify techniques, strikes, or poses if you find them too difficult.
Think about walking to class if possible or do a quick jog around the block just beforehand so your blood is circulating. Stretch after you’ve walked or jogged to prepare your body for your class . This will reduce the risk of muscle strain and other injuries., While there are plenty of media searchable online or available for purchase, you should do your best to take a class. Learning a martial art from an instructor will allow you to reap the full extent of its health benefits.When watching a video or reading a book at home, you’re more likely to injure yourself with incorrect forms. In addition, you won’t have an instructor present to offer assistance if you do get hurt.
Developing a routine is easier when you make an investment. If you’ve already paid for a class, you’re more likely to make the commitment.Remember to sign up for classes that are easy to get to and convenient for your schedule.

, Making your routine fun is important for any form of exercise. Ask people in your personal network if they have interest signing up for a class with you. If they already take a class, ask to join theirs.In addition to bonding and having fun together, you can motivate each other to show up for training.

, If you stick you to your routine, you’ll see more and more health benefits. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science demonstrated that age appropriate martial arts training over a five month period improved cognition and coordination and reduced the risk of injuries due to falling. The experiment showed that participants who pursued study for ten months saw further improvements."

Finding a good martial arts teacher for your children is ninety percent of the battle.,
Get to know a couple of the mainstream Martial arts (judo, Karate, taekwondo and kickboxing, say) and learn what they have to offer and if each is right for your child.,
You will need to spend a little time doing research.,
If a school does not have formal teaching ranks, but appears interesting to you, then pay them a visit.,
Once you are happy with the instructor, take a look at the facility your child will be training in.,
Take a look at the costs you will have to incur if your children are members of the club.,
Lastly, check to see that the martial arts club you choose has a record in your community.",How to Find a Martial Art for Your Kids," Unfortunately only certain schools lay out formal qualification guidelines for their teachers. There are schools that have no guidelines and yet very good teachers. What's a parent to do?

, Sit through a few classes. Judo for example involves throws, locks and being pinned on the ground, so if your child is claustrophobic it wouldn't be a good idea. That said , judo improves physical strength and confidence, so it depends on the child.

, Fortunately the internet makes this a lot easier. Make a list of the schools in your town and start checking the websites for the schools. What you should look for is a school that has a formal education program for its teachers. Some karate schools for example have teaching ranks such as ""juin-shidoin"" and ""shidoin"" in addition to black belt degree ranking. The whole point of these teaching ranks is to formalize the process of passing on the martial art to the student. It's a recognition that teaching aspects such as self discipline and self control are just as important as teaching a child how to spar.

, Talk to the head instructor. You can learn a lot from sitting in on a couple of classes. Does the instructor control the class well ?, Does the instructor keep his students attention for the entire class ?, Are the students enjoying themselves ? A good instructor will engage his students and make them want to return. A good instructor will demonstrate that they truly care about the advancement of their students in more ways than just the martial arts.

, A good martial arts training hall should be spotlessly clean. If you see students cleaning the hall before and after the lesson, you know this is a school that cares about the development of the whole person. Cleaning is not menial forced labour, it shows the students care about their teacher and want to preserve their art. This is also a point in the favour of small schools that may not have formalized teaching ranks.

, There are great martial arts schools that operate clearly as profit making businesses, but there are also wonderful not-for-profit schools that depend on the involvement of the students for survival. Cost alone does not define a great school but it obviously affects the parent. If you want to have your child picked up from school by the martial arts club, taught martial arts everyday and given time to finish homework, this is available but of course the cost will be relatively high. Conversely you might opt for the not-for-profit school which is the least expensive, but you must bear in mind that you or your child may need to volunteer time and effort to assure the clubs continued survival.

, For example, the club gets together to do a push-up-a-thon to provide funds for a guide dog for the blind, or the club has trophy or a contest named in honour of a past student or instructor that passed away. This is evidence that the club and its leader, care about the students and the community they live in.

For what purpose do you want to learn martial arts? Is it to learn the sports side of martial arts, to become healthier, to defend yourself, learn how to street fight, learn the more artistic side such as forms/sets... By knowing this before hand it will help you determine if their focus is the same as yours when you are observing or trying out a class for the first time.
What style are you interested in trying out? There are hundreds of different styles out there which is why it is important to know your strengths. If you are more sports or artistic oriented you will need to figure out if you are a kicker, puncher or wrestler? If you are interested in self-defense or street fighting then you need to figure out which system you think is more realistic to use in a street situation.;
,


The Internet is always the best way to figure out where the closest facilities are positioned, but don't decide upon a facility just from the look of its website. Go visit and observe a class or two! Even ask around to hear other peoples opinion about the places you have found. Make sure you don't just chose a facility just because it is closer, sometimes you need to travel a bit in order to receive proper training.

,


Make sure that the classes are not too big or too small. If classes are too big it will be difficult for the instructor to personally engage each individual student which means that you won't receive as much instructing as you should. If classes are too small you should find out if it is because of the reputation of the instructor.

,


It is very important to observe the instructor to figure out if he has the right amount of experience and skills to be teaching. Does he look as if he is in control? How focused is his students on him when he is giving instructions? The way the students behave will often make you able to tell if the students respect the instructor or not regarding his teaching abilities.

, Just because an instructor is very skillful doesn't mean he is a good teacher!


Make sure to not only look at the fighting abilities of the instructor, also look to see if he has the abilities to teach. Is he engaging every student while he is teaching or is he just drilling them like they are ""numbers""? Also make sure to check if he is actually focused on teaching and improving his students instead of focusing on his own training and just using the students as test subjects for trying out his techniques. Yes! There are actually instructors who has that kind of narcissistic behavior while teaching.

,


It is not uncommon for martial artists to want to teach their own class. The problem is that many of them start their teaching prematurely. People should not start teaching if they still do not have the required fighting experience which is needed in order to effectively use their techniques in real sparring or combat.

,


When the above steps have been followed you will know which school and instructor to choose. Good luck with your training!

By meeting with a boxing instructor or gym attendant, you can quickly and safely learn basic technique and the different types of training available.
An expert will also help you figure out which type of punching bag is right for you.
If you don't have access to a gym or boxing club, try watching instructional videos online.;
, You want to buy a punching bag made of top grain leather, heavy-duty canvas, or vinyl. The average punching bag weighs around 80 pounds, though lightweight bags are about 35 pounds and heavy bags can weigh as much as 200 pounds.For general fitness, choose a lightweight bag.
For karate, boxing, or mixed martial arts training, choose a heavy bag.
You can buy punching bags at sporting good stores or many online retailers.

, If you plan on using the punching bag on a regular basis, invest in a quality pair of boxing gloves with extra padding to reduce the risk of injury.


You can also use hand wraps under your gloves to supply additional padding and protection.

, Keep loose or long hair pulled back, dress in gym or fitness clothes that fit your form but don't restrict your movement, and wear athletic shoes and socks. It’s important to dress properly, so that you avoid hair or clothing getting caught by the swinging bag.

It’s also important to wear good shoes so that you don’t slip.

, Some basic ones to start out with include lead, hook, and uppercut strikes, elbow strikes, and front, knee, and roundhouse kicks.Consult a punching bag book or browse online videos to review any specifics on form and technique that you might have missed at the gym or boxing club.

, You'll want to choose a place where you have plenty of space to move around the bag and to allow the bag to swing. The space should be clear of debris and barriers, so that you don’t back up or run into other objects or equipment while working with the bag.

The amount of space you need will depend on the type of training you are doing, but an 8 feet by 8 feet (or 2.5 meter by 2.5 meter) square space is good for getting started.
Basements are a good place to hang a punching bag because they usually provide better, safer mounting options and will help muffle the sound of the punching on the bag.

, You want the beam to be at least 24 inches (61 centimeters) from a side wall. It is crucial that your bag is hung from a stud or it could fall and hurt you and anything else under it., The hole will be used to install an eyebolt screw. When you drill the hole, choose a drill bit size that is slightly smaller than the size of the eyebolt. This will ensure a snug fit., Once your hole is drilled, insert the eyebolt and turn it by hand. As it becomes harder to turn, use a screwdriver or a pair of pliers inserted through the eyebolt to finish the tightening., By adding a swivel hook to the top of the chains, the bag will be able to spin as you work the bag. This reduces tension on the eyebolt., The S hook allows for easy connection between the swivel hook and the eyebolt.

If you are using a lightweight bag, you may also need to secure the bag to the floor, to keep it from swinging up and hitting the ceiling.
Follow any specific hanging instructions that come with your bag.

, If you don’t have the option to hang your bag from the ceiling, a heavy duty wall mount or stand is a safe alternative. Be sure to follow the directions that come with the mount or stand to ensure safety.Wall mounts are sturdy, but they restrict the swing of the bag and your movement around it. They also make kicks and follow-up punch angles more difficult to set up.
A bag stand restricts your movement and mobility even more than a wall mount, but it is much easier to remove and store, if you don’t want the equipment sitting out all the time.

, You reduce the risk of injury and muscle ache when you stretch and prepare your body for your workout routine. Be sure to stretch your hands, arms, back, and legs before approaching the punching bag.


You may also want to warm up with some cardio, such as a light jog or short jump rope session.

, Punching bags are primarily designed to help you build and develop striking power, and it takes time to build that up. Take your time, especially in the beginning. Start by working the bag for 30 seconds and increase your time by another 30 seconds with each new session.


Intense striking sessions shouldn't last longer than 5 minutes.
Limit yourself to 3 to 4 sessions a week working the bag.
Don’t overpower your punches and kicks or you could risk an injury.

, When you punch the bag, make sure the knuckles of your index and middle fingers are hitting the bag first. Striking with smaller knuckles increases your chances of a break., Balance and posture are important when working a punching bag. Speed and force will come once you’ve achieved a punching rhythm with balance and good posture.Throw punches at the bag, but don’t throw yourself or fall into the bag. When you punch, keep yourself balanced by keeping both your feet planted on the floor.

By focusing on balance and good posture, you keep your whole body aligned during the workout, which burns more calories, offers better fitness, and reduces risk of injury.

, When you hit the bag with your fists, be sure to keep your wrists straight or you risk strains and sprains. Keep your elbows tight when you punch, but don’t tense them.


It will take time to build up your tendon and wrist strength. Never try to hit the bag at full force when you are just starting out.
Tensing your elbows can cause harmful strain.

, This may seem obvious, but it’s easy to start pushing the bag around with your fists instead of giving it swift punches, especially if you start to get tired. You know you are properly punching the bag and not pushing it when the bag makes a sharp “smack” sound rather than a thud.

, In a real fight, you always need to be on the defense when you’re not punching. The same rules apply to a punching bag. Keep your feet, your hands, or your head moving in between punches., Professional boxers never take more than 2 seconds between punches. Don’t wait to throw punches., Focus on breathing rhythmically while you’re punching. If you're moving fast, you'll want to breath fast. If you're movements are relaxed, you'll want to relax your breathing.Breathing while punching is more important than punching, and breathing well will help conserve your strength and build up your endurance over time.

A common mistake is to hold your breath when you punch. Always exhale during a strike.

, Never strike the bag with your toes or your ankle. Make sure you hit the bag with your instep or the side of your foot following proper techniques., Once you’ve built up some technique and stamina, try working the bag with punching and kicking combinations.For combination ideas, search for online articles and videos using the search terms “punching bag combinations.”

, Professional athletes and boxers rarely spend more than 5 to 7 minutes working a punching bag with consecutive hits, kicks, and combinations, so be sure to pace yourself! If you're working the bag for fitness with lots of movement in between strikes, it's okay to work the bag longer., Once you’ve finished working the bag, take time to cool-down with a light jog, a brisk walk, and then some relaxing stretches.

Choose the right wrap.,
Wrap with the correct tension.,
Keep the wraps free of wrinkles.,
Keep your wrists straight when you wrap them.",How to Wrap Your Hands for Boxing1," There are many different types of wraps, and it's important to choose one the one that will work best for the size of your hands and the type of boxing you intend to do. Consider these options when you're picking out a wrap to buy:


Cotton wraps are a good choice for frequent training. They come in adult and junior lengths, and they are secured with velcro at the end.
Mexican wraps are similar to cotton wraps but they are woven with elastic fibers, so they mold to the hand more easily. They aren't quite as durable as cotton wraps because the elastic gets worn out over time, but they're a good option for training.
Gel wraps aren't actually woven onto the hand, but are slipped on like fingerless gloves. They are more expensive than cotton or Mexican wraps. They are convenient to slip on, but they don't provide as much wrist support as traditional wraps, and for that reason serious boxers don't usually opt for gels.
Competition wraps are composed of gauze and tape. Boxing rulebooks specify the exact amount that can be used, to make sure each boxer has the same amount of padding. Since these wraps aren't reusable, they aren't practical for use during everyday training. The wrapping technique for competition wraps is also different and should be done with a partner or coach. See this professional wrapping method for more information.;
, Hand wraps should be taut to provide stability for the hand and wrist, but if they're too tight they can cut off circulation. You might have to practice a few times before you get the tension just right.








, Lumps and wrinkles can be uncomfortable when you're trying to focus on boxing, and they also prevent the wrap from adequately protecting the fine bones in your hands and stabilizing your wrists.








, If your wrists are bent when you wrap them, they the wrap won't help to stabilize them. Your risk of injury won't be as high if you keep your wrists straight during the process.

Focus on your punching technique to improve power and endurance.,
Focus on smooth, clean speed bag drills.,
Hit the heavy bag for 3-minute intervals 3-5 times each training session.,
Try out 30-second punching ""sprints"" to build arm endurance.,
Begin a strength training regime.,
Try slow sparring.",How to Train for Boxing1," Good punches are efficient punches, transferring power to your opponent with grace and ease. While you should work on training your speed and endurance, better technique will always lead to a better boxer. While doing the following drills, focus on:


Leading with your elbow. Think of throwing your elbow at your opponent, not your wrist.
Staying compact. You don't want to flail or move your body unnecessarily. Keep your non-punching hand close and your legs sturdily underneath you.
Letting your arms rest and move during breaks. When you're not punching, leave your arms loose, or ""breathing,"" so that the rock comfortably with your body. Don't try and clench and hold them rigidly-- it will only tire you out faster.;
, Speed bags hang from the ceiling and require you to develop a strong, consistent rhythm to your punches. You hit with a regular, circular motion, keeping your hands and the bag moving. This is one of the best ways to build your endurance, connection, and coordination with your hands.


Run the speed bag for 3-5 3-minute sessions, taking only 30 seconds between each interval.

, The heavy bag, the enormous hanging bag for punch training, is going to become your best friend. You want to hit it for three minutes, punching like you would in a fight. However, make sure you're not just standing there trying to hit. Stay on the balls of your feet, dancing like in a real fight, and stop occasionally to duck, dodge, and block, like you would in a real fight. In general, the more like the real thing you can make it, the better the workout will be.For a more trying workout, give the bag a swing before beginning. This forces you to focus in on a moving target.

, Using a heavy bag, take 30 seconds to throw as many punches as you possibly can. Focus on speed, not power, as you throw the punches. After 30 seconds, rest for 30 seconds and then repeat 4-5 more times.

, You can choose to lift or simply use you body weight to build muscle. No matter what your style, mix in 2-3 days of strength training every week, cutting down to 1 on fight weeks. Luckily, boxing is so muscle intensive that you will be making gains each time you spar, fight, or shadowbox as well, so strength training should not be the focus of your workouts. Aim for big, multi-muscle exercises to build the most muscle the fastest. Some good exercises to try include:



Body weight: If you can't go to the gym, are under 16 years old, or just would rather not lift weights, there are plenty of great exercises to try:


Push-ups, close-handed and wide stance.
Dips
Do front and side planks.
Try body-weight rows, or inverted rows.
Pull-ups and chin-ups.



Weight lifting: Focus on smooth, fluid technique. You want to move both up and down with control for the safest, best results.

Rows, seated and standing

Bicep curls., A great tool for beginners, slow sparring takes all of your work into the ring for a safe, technique focused exercise. It is just like normal sparring with a partner, but you want to throw punches at 75% of your normal speed. This is the best way to work up your opposite hand, focus on techniques or moves that you don't have down yet, and build up confidence in the ring. Since you have to react to a live fighter, even at a slow pace, this is a great way build essential skills.


Focus on coordination -- follow through on your punches, keep your feet moving, and focus on hand positioning in all circumstances. All of your body parts should be moving in concert with one another."

Stand with your feet shoulder width apart in front of a mirror.,
Learn the basic shadow boxing punches, in order to create your own equipment-less exercise routine.",How to Shadow Box For Fun and Exercise1," Place your dominant foot forward slightly. Bend your knees, so that you could move your feet if you needed to, and hold your hands up near the top of your chest.;
, You want to stand in a T-formation, with solid posture through your back and shoulders. Flex your core muscles in as you try to execute the following punches slowly:


Do a jab. This is a swift punch aimed straight at your shadow's head. In boxing, it is used to stun, rather than deliver a knock out. You can do this with your right or left hands. Do a combination of a left jab and a right jab, while keeping your body tight and steady.






Do a straight punch. This is a punch with the right or left arm that is delivered with strong power. This is a knockout punch to your shadow's head.






Do a hook. A left or right hook should start with your fist near your chin. A right hook should go slightly to the right, before turning back in a leftward motion on your shadow's chin. The left hook should go in the opposite direction.






Do an uppercut. Drop down about 6 inches (15.2 cm) by bending your knees, and then send a swift and strong punch upwards toward your ""opponent's"" chin.






Do straight punches to the body. Bend your knees slightly and aim punches to the left and right sides of your shadow's body.

Add sand for a heavier bag, if desired.,
Fill half the bag with old clothing.,
Place a plastic bag inside another for extra support.,
Fill the punching bag.,
Adjust as needed.",How to Fill a Punching Bag2," Some people like to use sand for extra weight. It is not a good idea to have sand at the bottom of the bag as it can harden and can cause injury. Also, you don't want to pour the sand directly into the bag.

, This stops the sand bags sagging straight to the bottom and developing a rock-like feel.

, Carefully pour or scoop silver sand a plastic carrier bag, to about the size of a 1kg bag of sugar. Once you have the approximate size, tie the end of the bag and wrap the loose plastic around the sand bag. Use duct tape to tie it up.

, Once you have several sand bags, place them carefully in the middle of the punching bag, ensuring that they are totally surrounded by at least three inches of packed clothing/rags. The textiles should stop the bags from splitting inside the bag from the force of punches.

, If the bag is too heavy or you decide to make lighter in the future, just unzip the top of the bag and individually take the plastic bags of sand out until you get the desired weight.

Tightly fill the first third of the bag with clothing or rags.

,
Place a rubble sack inside the punching bag.

,
Scoop sawdust into the rubble sack until it gets fills up and touches the sides of the punching bag.

Stretch your hand out.,
Place your thumb through the hole at the end of the wrap.,
Wrap your wrist.,
Wrap your hand.,
Wrap your thumb.,
Wrap your fingers.,
Wrap your hand again.,
Secure the wrap.,
Repeat with the other hand.",How to Wrap Your Hands for Boxing2," Spread your fingers as far apart as possible and flex all of the muscles. The boxing wrap is meant to support the hand while it's in motion, so you should begin by exposing the wrap to all the movements you might use while boxing.








, It's located at the opposite end from the Velcro. Make sure the underside of the wrap is against your hand; if you wind the wrap upside down, you'll have trouble fastening it when you're finished. Most wraps will have a tag or printed place letting you know which side should face down.








, Wind the wrap around the back of your wrist 3 to 4 times, depending on the size of your hands and the level of stability you want to attain. Finish with the wrap at the inside of your wrist.









The wrap should be flat and directly overlap itself with each turn.
If you find that you need to add or reduce length to the wrap at the end, adjust the number of times you wrap your wrist.

, Pull the wrap around the back of your hand, over the area just above your thumb, and across your palm to the other side. Wrap the same place three times, ending with the wrap on the inside of your hand near the thumb.








, Start by wrapping your wrist one time, finishing with the wrap near your thumb. Wind the wrap from the bottom of your thumb toward the top, then back to the bottom. Finish by wrapping your wrist once more.








, Starting at the inside of your wrist, wind the wrap in the following way to secure your fingers at the base:









Wind the wrap from the inside of your wrist over the top of the hand and between the pinky and ring finger.
Wind it back from the inside of the wrist over the top of the hand and between the ring finger and middle finger.
Wind it again from the inside of the wrist over the top of the hand and between the middle finger and index finger. Finish at the inside of the wrist.

, Start by wrapping the wrist, then wrap diagonally from the inside of your wrist to the outside of your hand. Continue wrapping across your palm and just above your thumb. Repeat until the length of the wrap has been used, then finish with one last wrap around your wrist.








, Velcro it to secure it in place. Flex your hand and throw a few punches to determine if it's comfortable. If the wrap is too tight or too loose, redo it.








, It may be difficult to wrap using your non-dominant hand at first, but you'll get the hang of it after some practice. If you need help ask your coach or a partner to do it for you.

Do interval training 2-3 times a week.,
Mix in long runs, shadow boxing, and short sprints on non-interval days.,
Pepper in 1-2 long, slow distance runs each week to rest and stretch your legs.,
Jump rope every day you train.,
Work on agility drills, like ladders and quick cuts.,
Focus on good footwork technique.",How to Train for Boxing2," The classic long runs seen on Rocky are not actually great training for boxing. Boxing is about short, sustained bursts of high energy, and the best way to train for this is interval training. Intervals are when you alternate high energy, quick sprints with short rest periods. As you get more fit you can shorten the rest periods by 10-15 seconds, improving your gains even more. A good starter workout would be:


1-mile warm up at slow, easy jogging pace.
6 600m sprints, resting for 1 minute between each. You want to be running at roughly 75-80% of your top speed.
.5 mile slow, easy recovery jog at the end., Interval training will make up the bulk of your cardio workouts, and they are the best way to quickly and effectively train for several explosive rounds of boxing. However, you still want to move your legs on the off days. The best way to do this is with a mixture of full body workouts, longer, slower distance runs, and some light, quick sprints. The following activities, used at the US Olympic training camps, should be mixed and matched into a 30-60 minute long workout:


1-2 mile run for warm-up (moderate to fast pace).
Shadowbox 1 round (3-minute round).
Run backward 200 meters.
Sprint 100 meters.
Jog with hands up, throwing realistic punches, for 400 meters., The classic 4-5 mile morning run still has its place in boxing training. Use it on days where you need to recover, especially after 2-3 straight days of intense workouts. Longer, slower runs are also best in the days leading up to a fight, as you don't want to be sore and tired when you step in the ring. Run for 30 minutes to an hour at a nice, comfortable pace, and stretch before and after.


Many trainers recommend doing your runs first thing in the morning, giving you time to refuel and rest for the skills workout later on.
As you jog, keep your hands in defensive position, occasionally throwing mock punches, to get your arms warmed up. This is why most boxers call running ""roadwork."", Jumping rope is one of the most fantastic boxing workouts imaginable, strengthening your heart, agility, timing, and coordination. You should aim to fit 15 minutes of jump rope into every workout. Start with the basic jogging technique, alternating feet as you spin the rope. As you improve, try alternate, more technical foot patterns:


Jump with both feet together.
Cross your hands. As the rope is coming down, past your nose, cross your wrists over each other, then uncross them once the rope is passed your feet.
Move as you jump. ""Walk"" forwards, backward, and side to side by hopping around as you jump., Ladder drills are common in gyms across the world, and can be adapted easily into a variety of workouts. To do them, set up cones or a workout ladder, and focus on quickly moving your feet through ever single space. As you progress, mix up the routine by skipping every other foot, touching in each space 2 times, working in and out of the ladder forward and backward, etc.



Ladder workouts are common in many sports, and you should constantly try new movements.

, Having good footwork is not just about training your heart and lungs. To be a better boxer, you need to train with good form so that you don't think about your feet during a fight. When working on footwork, focus on:


Staying on the balls of your feet. These are the ""knobs"" right before your toes. This makes pivoting, moving, and shifting much easier.
Keep your spine straight. Avoid hunching or leaning back. This keeps your center of gravity even and allows for smoother movement.
Relax your upper body. You want loose shoulders and pecs."

Make sure your diet consists only of healthy foods.,
Shadowbox by yourself in the ring.,
Do pull ups and chin ups to build back and arm strength essential for a good punch.,
Build a strong core.,
Watch other fighters with a critical eye.,
Find a sparring partner and spar 1-2 a week.",How to Train for Boxing3," Choose proteins as the basis of your diet, and eliminate high-calorie junk like fried foods, cakes, creams, butters, and sugars. Drink plenty of water each day. The more water you take in, the better it will be for your body. A good meal might include:


Lean proteins, like eggs, fish, and chicken, are essential.
Good, unsaturated fats, found in fish, avocados, and nuts.
Complex carbohydrates, like pasta, whole wheat, and quinoa, instead of white rice, white bread, and other simple sugars.
If you're thirsty, at any point in the day, get some water. If you're drinking to keep thirst at bay, you're well hydrated.Make sure you always have a lot of water available when training.

, Shadowboxing is just you and the ring as you move around, throw punches, and mimic the rhythm of a real fight. This is the best way to train into fighting shape without worrying about injuries or taking punches. However, you need to be focused on getting the most out of it. Keep your feet moving, alternate between throwing punches and blocking, and keep the intensity up. Most importantly, make sure you time each ""bout"" to last the same time as a standard round -- 3 minutes for amateur fighters.Focus on your movement around the ring. Keep active as you move, dart, and dance.
The hardest part of shadowboxing is the mentality. You need to convince yourself to practice with intensity or you're not going to get a lot out of it.

, Even if you don't do any other strength training, make sure you're doing pull-ups. Perform a few each day, and try to work up to higher amounts over time. Focus on a slow, even motion both up and down for the best workout. While they are difficult at first, try to start with at least 10 a day, gradually working up.


The differences between pull-ups and chin-ups are your grip and the muscles used.

For pull-ups, both palms face away from you, hands shoulder-width apart. They work your back, shoulders, and core, focusing on your back.
For chin-ups, both palms face towards you, hands shoulder width apart. They work your back, biceps, chest, and core, focusing more on chest and biceps.



, Your core, made up of your abs and obliques, is where you transfer energy from your upper body to your lower. As such, it cannot be underestimated when training for boxing. You should work on core every day, mixing in 3 sets of 20 reps of:


Body holds. A modified crunch to protect your back, start by sitting on your butt with knees and feet in the air. Place your palms under the floor, underneath your back, and curl your head up towards your knees for one exercise.Planks (1-2 minutes each side, repeated 2-3 times)
Leg lifts., Like any other sport, you can learn a ton by watching the greats. Make watching fights a part of your training routine. As you watch, spend each round watching specific things. In one round, watch their feet -- how they get out of trouble, move around the ring, and position themselves on offense and defense. Then watch their hands. When are they throwing punches, how do they react and counter-attack on defense?, This is the only way to get realistic practice. You get used to hitting and being hit by a moving opponent that fights back unlike a heavy bag. This is the time to get a full body workout, work on new techniques, and grow as a boxer. There is no substitute for sparing when it comes to training.


Try and spar with better boxers whenever possible. They will push you to learn more and help you grow quicker as a fighter.

Punch into the air for 3 straight minutes at any speed.,
Add in footwork.,
Speed punch for 3 minutes.,
Rest between 3-minute periods.,
Begin interval training.,
Rest by shadow boxing in slow motion.,
Add in weights to create a better aerobic and strength-training workout.",How to Shadow Box For Fun and Exercise2," Use a mirror, if you want to create an ""opponent,"" or turn on a bright light behind you, so that you can project your shadow on to the wall. A shadow boxing exercise program can be done almost anywhere and in almost any clothes.


It is best to wear flat shoes, rather than heels. Athletic shoes with arch supports are preferable, so you can incorporate flexible movement into your exercise routine.







, Flex your arm muscles and make the movements as deliberate as possible. When you are confident that you are ready to speed up, then you can begin to move faster.

, Set a timer or start along with a clock. Do the same punches or use any combination, while you bend your knees and keep your core muscles secure to retain your balance.

, Incorporate lunges, squatting, switch feet or hop between your front and back foot, as if you are ready to follow your opponent around the ring. Footwork and hopping increases the intensity of this cardiovascular workout.


You can do the hand work (punches) and footwork separately, and then try adding them together. You must be careful to retain good posture and core muscle strength while you move.







, A boxer usually aims to throw about 250 to 300 punches per 3-minute period. You will be much slower than this when you start, so count your punches and work up to this speed.

, In the beginning, speed punching and footwork will increase your heart rate and make you sweat. As you continue boxing, you will be able to add intervals into your speed boxing routine to create an even better workout.

, Punch for 3 minutes, and then do jumping jacks, jump rope or climb up and down stairs for 1 minute. Repeat this set 3 to 5 times for an excellent cardiovascular workout.

, Concentrate on each punch by flexing your muscles and delivering punches as slowly and deliberately as possible for 1 to 3 minutes. Return to a faster workout once you catch your breath.

, Punch by holding 1 to 3 lb. (0.5 to 1.4 kg) weights, secure wrist weights or use weighted boxing gloves. These can all be purchased at most sporting goods supply stores.

Observe your opponent.,
When he throws a punch, move slightly out of the way.,
Do not move your head back to where it came from!,
Slip to the outside.",How to Slip Punches in Boxing," Often, having fast reflexes is not enough. During a fight, you can become punch drunk or tired and lose your faculties. Thus, you must study your opponent in the beginning of the fight and learn his tells. When is he going to throw a punch? What punch is it going to be? Don't make too many assumptions because there is a chance that he is trying to get you into habits that will set you up for a knockout punch.;
, Make sure that you only move enough to dodge the punch. Don't move too much or too little.

, This amateur mistake is very predictable and can lead to a quick knockout. instead adjust your feet slightly to match where your head is or bob and weave into a new position--anywhere but where your head started will do.

, This makes you impossible to hit after slipping. This rule should be followed loosely when it comes to jabs. Your opponent may do one of the following to throw you off:


Throw a jab a little to the left, hoping he can catch you being predictable
Throw or feint one jab and throw another quick one hoping that you don't have any room left on the outside or that you won't recover quickly enough.

Get in your jab stance.,
Use your entire body to punch.,
Allow your muscles to recover.,
Focus on technique.,
Visualize your speed.,
Use hand weights.,
Focus on speed in your gym sessions.,
Stay relaxed.,
Practice as much as your schedule allows.,
Keep loose with dynamic stretches.,
Wear proper equipment.",How to Punch With Speed," A jab is the fastest punch that you can throw. Slightly hunch your back with your knees bent. Keep your elbows facing inwards toward your body with your fists up and close to your face.Tuck your chin in to protect your jaw and stand on the balls of your feet. The side of your body with your dominant hand should be tilted behind the shoulder of your non-dominant side.


For example, if you want to throw a left-handed jab, the right side of your body will be ahead of your left.Your dominant side should be coiled and ready to throw the punch.
Prepare your hand for throwing your punch by closing your fingers. Your thumb should be kept outside of your fist because if you tuck it in it may lead to broken fingers.;
, Only using your arm muscles doesn’t produce your maximum speed or power.Use the weight and force of your body as you move forward with your punch. Throw your jab by stepping forward and twisting your body. This utilizes the strongest legs muscles to propel your punch forward.Once you throw your jab, snap back into your stance to throw another punch or defend a counter- attack.When you throw your job, fully extend your arm to utilize all your arm muscles., Take a breath and relax after you throw a punch. Take a break and don’t throw multiple punches because you will get slower with each successive punch.Once your fatigue fades, continue practicing. Taking a break in between punches lets you focus on each punch and to generate as much speed as you can. You do not want to waste energy on weak or slow movements.Throw proper punches before focusing on speed. Speed will be useless if your punch is weak or breaks your fingers.

, Correct technique ensures no wasted movement. You want your punch to be as efficient as possible to make sure the movement is focused purely on speed. Avoid flaring your elbow. You want to punch with both speed and accuracy., Get yourself psychologically ready for creating speed by picturing fast objects like a fighter jet, race car, or lightning bolt as you throw your punch. Take a deep breath, relax, and throw your punch as if you are the fast object that you envision., Shadow box for four two minute rounds. Use one or two pound weights for the first and third round. Don’t use any weight in the second and fourth round and feel the difference in your hand speed.The benefits of using weights in shadow boxing are that it build strength in your shoulder muscles and arms. This not only increases speed but also power.

, Perform sprints, speed exercises, and speed punch combinations. Speed exercises include pushups with explosive speed and sit ups to strengthen your core. Shadow box, punch the punching bag, and jump rope all at maximum speed.Do 10 x 10 sets of pushups and situps. Do six one minute rounds of shadow boxing, punching bag, and jump rope, only resting for 15 seconds in between rounds., Tense muscles do not produce a lot of speed. You want your movement to be fluid. Do not clench your fist until the last possible second before you punch. Control your breathing and keep your shoulders loose., Your speed will only increase if you put in the work. Your punches won’t get faster unless you put in the time. You want to develop muscle memory by repeating the same technique over and over.Completing drills and developing a routine will cement the movement into your memory., Dynamic stretches require movement to stretch your muscles whereas static stretches require you to pull and hold your muscle to feel the stretch. Get your muscles working and warmed up with dynamic stretches.Some examples of dynamic stretches to help with your speed are squats, jumping jacks, jump rope, and lunges.Stretch your arms with hugging motions or arm rotation. As long as you feel like your body is moving and your muscles are being activated, you are likely dynamic stretching.
Your muscles can be compared to rubber bands. They will be tight and constricted when cold. When you warm your muscles up the movement becomes easier.Finish your warm up once you feel your muscles are loose., Wear athletic clothing and proper footwear. You want your clothes to be comfortable and they should not restrict your movement. Make sure to tightly lace your shoes so that you get proper traction.Don’t eat a heavy meal before practice or practice with an empty stomach. Eat a healthy light snack to get you through your workout as oily junk food, like burgers, will make you lethargic. Remember to drink a lot of water while you practice to stay hydrated."

Master the technique in order to punch harder.,
Get your feet and legs in the right position.,
Move your hips and torso to generate power.,
Make sure you exhale before you punch.,
Lean your head over slightly, tuck your chin, and look at your target while punching.,
Streamline your arm and fist.,
Aim where it hurts the most.,
Learn some fighting techniques from other disciplines.",How to Punch Harder1," Do you see golfers hitting insane tee shots with bad technique? Do you see Major Leaguers hitting towering home runs with bad technique? Do you see swimmers carving through water at breakneck speeds with bad technique? We didn't think so either. The right punching technique will not only make your punches harder; it will make them more efficient, meaning less energy gets packed into a bigger punch you will have to practice;
, Your feet and legs are the anchors of your weight. They keep you balanced, but allow you to transfer power from your lower body to your upper body, right through to your fist. Here are some quick tips for you to consider when using your feet and legs.


Place your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart. When in doubt, place them apart a little further.
Lift your back foot heel up, and keep it lifted. Don't be ""flat"" footed.
Point your toes in the direction of your punch. Pointing your feet away from your target will deliver a less forceful punch.
Keep you knees bent. When you punch, your knees can then extend, giving your punch extra power.

, Try it: hitting an object without moving your hips or your torso. It's not a very strong punch, is it? Now try moving your hips and torso when you punch. It's at least twice as forceful as the first punch, right? Think about it: professional golfers, tennis players, and baseball players all use their hips and torso to generate extra power. There's no reason why you shouldn't, too.









Use your hips to swing your torso back. Think of it like cocking a gun. Then unload by reversing your hip movement, swinging your torso towards the target.

, Breathing out, or exhaling, will help loosen your muscles right before contact. If you're having trouble exhaling before you punch, make a noise as you punch. Martial artists do this all the time to ensure that they've exhaled.

, You lean slightly and tuck your head so that your head is out of the way from counterattack; keeping it still would just make it easier to target. Keep your target in sight to direct your hand to punch. This is a natural guiding method for your hand.

, Aside from the power you generate from your hips, proper arm and fist technique is the most important part of a successful punch. Here are some tips you can use to make sure you're getting the most out of your arm and fist.









Keep both your arm and fist relaxed until immediately before contact. As you feel contact with the opponent, tighten your fist. A relaxed fist will travel better through the air, but a tight fist will deliver more of a punch.
Punch straight with your arm, not with an arc. You might be tempted to trace a long arc with your punch, but don't: Remember that your power comes from your hips and torso, not from the path of the arm.
Don't cock back your hand or arm. This is called ""telegraphing,"" or showing the opponent what you're going to be doing before you do it.

, If you're going to aim, it's best to aim for the right places — places where you'll inflict the most damage:


Chin
Temple
Solar plexus
Ribs

Wrap the carpet padding around the PVC pipe.,
Cover the carpet padding in duct tape.,
Run a piece of rope through the two exposed holes on top of the PVC pipe.,
Hang the bag.",How to Make a Punching Bag1," Measure the pipe and draw a line where you will cut using a maker. Use a PVC pipe cutter or a hacksaw to cut the PVC pipe., One set of holes will be used to attach the base. The other set of holes will be used to hang the bag.

, Trace the outline of where you will be cutting with a compass. You can also trace the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket. Use a saw to cut a 10” diameter circle out of the plywood. Then draw a 4-inch diameter circle and cut that out of the plywood.

, Place the plywood inside of the PVC pipe so that it’s even with the holes you drilled. Drill screws through these holes to secure the plywood to PVC pipe.

, Place the 10-inch piece on the bottom of the pipe where the 4-inch piece is. Drill screws through the 10-inch and 4-inch pieces of plywood so that they are connected.

, You want the carpet to roughly match the size of the PVC pipe. You want to leave about four inches of pipe uncovered at the top of the punching bag so that the holes you drilled are exposed.

, Start by taping one edge of the carpet padding to the pipe and then slowly roll the pipe until the carpet padding is completely wrapped around the pipe. Once all of the carpet padding is on the pipe, tape down the loose edge of the carpet using duct tape.


Make sure you wrap the pipe as tightly as possible as you want the bag to be solid when you punch it.

, Take the roll of duct tape and attach a piece of tape to the carpet closest to the base. Start rolling the tape around the carpet padding on the PVC pipe. Make sure you overlap as you tape so that you have very tight layers. You will cover every bit of exposed carpet padding that runs the length of the pipe with tape.


Apply as much tape as you can to the top of the carpet, but don’t worry about completely covering it.

, Make sure both ends of the rope are equal in length and then tie them together.

, Find out where you want to hang the bag. If you are hanging the bag from the ceiling, be sure to hang it from a stud so that the bag does not fall and injure you.

One way to increase punching strength is to use a heavy punching bag.,
When you have obtained your bag, begin training on it.,
Start incorporating small dumbbell weights into your punching routine.,
Practice jabbing the air with the dumbbells.",How to Punch Harder2," Not so heavy that you have no more knuckles after your workout, but not so light that you blast the bag away with your first strike. It's one of those ""Goldilocks And The Three Bears"" situations: not too much, not too little, just right.

, Use the tips outlined above about how to improve your technique, and practice them on the punching bag. Remember to really put your hips into each punch.








, Don't use dumbbells that are challenging for you to lift. Start with 5 or 10 lbs, or perhaps 15 lbs if you lift weights regularly.

, Punching with dumbbells will increase your speed and shoulder endurance as well as building strength when you deliver the punch.


Start off by doing 12-15 reps of punches on one hand, and then switch to the other hand. Try to shoot for 10 sets on each hand; do this daily.






Remember to not overtrain your dominant hand at the expense of the other. If you have an obvious weakness in one hand, focus on training that hand. In a fight, a smart opponent will try to exploit your weak side. Not giving him an exploitation point will make you a stronger fighter.






Gradually increase the weight as you become accustomed to the lower weight. Increase your weight will make your arm-strength and speed increase without trying you will get knocked out.
Never punch a punching bag with dumbbell weights in your hand. Only air-jab with weights in your hand.

Place a foam pad under the tires.",How to Make a Punching Bag2," x 4 in. 8 in. boards. These boards will make up the post to the punching bag. To create the shape you need, place two boards on top of each other and then place the remaining board along their 2-inch sides. Glue the boards together using wood glue. Make sure you run the glue along the lengths of the boards. Once they are glued, screw them together., You want them to stick out so that they can help the board stay in the concrete mix.

, Nail the plywood into the bottom of the boards. The plywood needs to be big enough to support the three boards while standing...

, You want the glue to dry completely before moving on to the next steps.

, Make sure they are evenly stacked. The tires will form your base.

, Use four bags of concrete so that you have enough to fill the inside of the tires. Place the bag of concrete inside of the wheelbarrow towards one end. Cut the bag open using a hoe. Once it’s open, pour out the mix and remove the bag.A wheelbarrow allows you to mix the concrete easily.
You can use a shovel or spade instead of the hoe.

, With the concrete on one side of the wheelbarrow, pour the required amount of water into the other side. To find the required amount of water, read the bag of the concrete mix. Adding more than the required amount can render the mix ineffective.


Make sure to keep about 4 cups of water nearby in case you need to add more to the mix.

, Using a hoe, gradually mix small amounts of the concrete into the water. Keep mixing until the mix is completely wet. As you mix the concrete, make a pile of wet mix on one side of the wheelbarrow.

, Place the post inside of the tires and then fill the tires completely with concrete, making sure there are no empty spaces left inside. While the concrete is still wet, make sure that the post is leveled and centered in the tires. Smooth the top of the concrete.


Make sure you wear gloves and safety goggles when pouring and maneuvering the concrete. The concrete mix can cause serious burns.

, If you move on to the next steps and the concrete is still dry, then the post will be uneven. Once the mix is dry, the base will become very heavy. To maneuver the stand, angle the post down and roll it using the tires.

, The futon mattress will be used for the padding of the punching bag. Lay the post down. Attach one end of the cut mattress to the post by using duct tape. Wrap the remaining part of the mattress until it is completely around the post. Tape the loose end of the mattress down with duct tape. Make sure the mattress is wrapped tight so that the punching bag has structure.


Check with your local classifieds or online postings to find a futon mattress if you do not want to purchase a new one.

, Now that the mattress is secured to the post, wrap the exposed area with duct tape. Make sure you overlap as you tape so that you have very tight layers. You will cover every bit of exposed mattress that runs the length of the post. This will completely secure the mattress and make it suitable for punching.

, The pad will help keep the bag quiet when you hit it.

Assume the right stance.,
Keep your eyes on your target.,
Generate force from your hips and torso.,
Spring your arm forward.,
Connect and exhale.",How to Punch Harder and Faster1," The positioning of your feet and legs is central to punching well, since punching involves your entire body. Position your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees a little so you'll be able to rotate toward your target with ease and throw your weight behind your punches.


If you're punching with your right hand, your right foot should be slightly set back with the heel lifted. If you're punching with your left hand, your left foot should be slightly set back with the heel lifted.
As you punch, your feet will pivot in the direction of the punch. They should not leave the ground when you're throwing a power punch.If you lift your feet, you're taking some of your body weight out of the equation, and your punch won't be as strong.;
, Your focus should never leave your target. Never close your eyes or look away; in order to aim correctly and execute the punch with power and precision, stay completely focused. Tuck in your chin a bit so that when you punch, your chin is protected by your punching arm., As you begin your punch, rotate your hips and torso toward your target. Try to position yourself so that the rotation is as complete as possible, even if you're very close to your target. Your punch will be stronger if you're able to rotate completely, rather than doing a smaller pivot. You should really feel the weight of your body going into the punch.


As you practice punching, pay attention to your hips. Spin them quickly and forcefully toward your target as though you were going to hit your target with your hips instead of your fist. This will help you generate the power you need for a strong, fast punch.
As you rotate, you shouldn't need to lean forward or reach. If you have to reach to far to hit your target, you'll lose power.

, Keep your shoulders loose until you're ready to punch, then spring your arm forward so that you can easily reach the person you're punching. Keep your hand relaxed until your arm is in motion, then make a fist so that your punch has a hard impact.


When you make a fist, tuck in your four fingers. Make sure your thump wraps around the fingers, so it won't be caught up in your punch.

Wrapping your hands before you get started will help you avoid injury and make your punch more powerful.
Don't cock your fist before you punch, since this lets your opponent in on your plan before you get the chance to hit. This is called telegraphing, and it results in lost matches.

, When you make contact with your target, exhale sharply. It might take some practice to time your breathing so that you exhale with every punch, but it's worth the effort to get in the right breathing rhythm. Inhale before the punch and exhale as you deliver it, throwing every bit of your body's energy into the hit.


After you deliver your punch, spring back into position for the next one.
Remember to keep your chin tucked in so that you're prepared for a counter punch if it comes.

Learn how to wrap your hands.,
Build up stamina.,
Increase punching power and hand speed.,
Get enough nutrients.",How to Prepare for Boxing Lessons," Before a fighter wearing gloves and entering the ring, you wrap your hands first. This is done using hand wraps, which can be made from cotton, elastic fibers and gel (the latter being fingerless wraps). In this case, try to opt for ones made of cotton or elastic fibers. Basically, hand wraps are used for two purposes: to protect the tendons and muscles and to help tighten the fist. Learn how to apply hand wraps before setting foot into the gym in order to save your instructor the trouble. It’ll also enable you to go straight into training.;
, Though you do not run great lengths when inside the boxing ring, the matches require you to be in perpetual motion. You will learn how to do so in boxing lessons, which is why you need to start building up stamina as soon as possible. In most professional matches, boxers usually lose steam in the latter part of the fights. Though the chances of you ending up fighting a 12 round bout are low, it pays to have the lungs of an elephant and the endurance of a migrating bird. Remember, the stronger your endurance, the longer you’ll last during the lessons, enabling you to get the most out of the experience.

, Increasing punching power and hand speed does not actually require you to lift heavy weights (mainly because it slows down your hands). Keep in mind that lifting weights is for people who want huge biceps, not for those who want to enhance their punching ability. In boxing, the power of your punches depends on how much force you put behind your fists in seconds. To enhance this ability, simply train with a medicine ball. As for hands speed, try to shadow box while holding a couple of two to five pound dumbbells.

, Since boxing is a physically straining sport, you need to be able to get sufficient nutrients to fuel you. Make sure that your diet includes healthy doses of protein, calcium, zinc and the essential vitamins. Take in food supplements if your diet does not provide enough but talk to your health professional first. If you’re aiming to lose some weight, focus on eating a high protein diet."

Buy suitable timber beams.,
Drill a hole in each timber beam.,
Connect the beams with the eye bolt/nut.,
Attach the weight distribution rope.,
Anchor the stand.,
Set the feet.,
Set the suspension handles.,
Attach a suspension rope.,
Set the suspension grip.",How to Make a Punching Bag Stand," Go to your local hardware store and select two timber beams for your stand. Make sure to get solid timbers that are not going to break on you. For example: 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) wide and 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) thick timber beams.


For the length of the timber beams you’ll need roughly twice your own height, so if you’re 6 foot tall, get 12 foot timber beams. This will ensure plenty of height to hand the punching bag.;
, Drill a hole 2 feet from the top of each timber. This hole needs to be big enough for the eye bolt to go through, so if using the 8mm eye bolt, drill an 8mm hole.

,


Lay the two timber beams down, intersecting at the second hole (two feet from top).
Thread the eye bolt through the two beams and attach the eye nut on the other end. Do not tighten - allow enough space for the beams to open and close easily, so that they can be folded away when needed.

,


Grab three carabiners. Measure and cut 20 feet of rope.
Seal off the cut ends with a cigarette lighter flame to prevent the ends from fraying.
Thread one end through the top hole in one timber beam to a length of about 3 feet.
The other end, thread it through a carabiner, then through the eye bolt connecting the timbers, then back through the same carabiner and finally through the other timber’s top hole.
Tie an overhand stopper knot about 2 feet from the end of each rope with a carabiner going through each knot.
Tie the ends of the ropes together using a double sheet bend knot.

, Correct anchoring of your stand is the most crucial part of setting it up.


Use it to hang a punching bag; do not anchor it to any walls as the constant jarring can cause the wall to shatter. The best anchor point is the base of a tree or a solid branch. If using over concrete floor, you could use a link bolted to the floor.
The force on the anchor point will be substantial, so use common sense.
Take the main length of rope and tie an overhand bow knot on the end.
Attach a carabiner and connect it to the anchor point (for example, around a tree trunk).
Measure off enough rope, but do not cut it off yet. Tie an overhand bow knot and attach a carabiner.
Connect this carabiner to the carabiner on the distribution rope and position the stand upright as shown.

, Once the stand is up, make sure that the feet can’t slip from their positions. There are different ways to set the feet in place depending on the surface:


Lawn or dirt: Cut wedges into the bottoms of the timbers, so that they can dig into the lawn or dirt.
Concrete or tiles: Cut the bottom of each timber on an angle so that the foot is flat on the floor when in position. For tiles, you may be able to sink the tile where each foot is positioned by half an inch so that the foot is wedged and cannot move.

Alternatively, you could cut out rubber souls from a rubber mat such as a yoga mat and glue to the bottoms of the feet to prevent slippage.



, For each handle, you’ll need about 3 feet of rope and 9 inches (22.9 cm) of PVC pipe.


Drill a hole one inch (2.5cm) from each end of the pipe (large enough for the rope to pass through).
Pass the rope through each end and tie an overhand stopper knot at each end.
Attach a carabiner to each rope as shown.

, Attach a spare carabiner to the eye bolt. Take the main length of rope and thread the end through one of the stand’s top carabiners, then through the carabiner on the eye bolt and then through the stand’s other top carabiner.


Pull it all the way down; you should have an M shape. Tie an overhand bow knot at each end and attach a carabiner to each bow knot.
Attach the handles to each of these carabiners. This will be your lowest point, so adjust the suspension rope length so that each handle is about 6 inches (15.2 cm) off the ground.

, The suspension grip component is how you will adjust the height of the suspension handles. It grips around one of the timber beams. To make it, take 3.5 feet of rope and tie an overhand bow knot at each end.


Connect the two bow knots using a single carabiner.
Loop the rope around one of the beams as shown, threading the carabiner through the loop.
Use a round file to file notches on the opposite side of the timber beam. This is to stop the suspension grip device from slipping.

Relax your body and your mind when you throw your punches.,
Avoid telegraphing and your speed will increase.,
Retract your hand fast, following each punch.,
Increase punching speed by performing reverse push-ups.,
Practice your punches, and your speed will increase naturally.,
Consider overlapping your punches and you will notice your speed increase.",How to Improve Punching Speed," Oftentimes, when you anticipate a punch or kick, it causes your muscles to tense, and tensing your body slows your movements down. Take a few calming breaths before beginning your punch speed exercise.;
, The giveaway moves take time that you can be using for the action itself. So don't waste time telegraphing. Learning how to punch without telegraphing is a necessity for technique as well as speed.

, Accelerating punching speed can be achieved when the retrieval is as fast as the outbound action.

, Instead of lowering your body and pushing it up, begin at the lowered position and push your body up. The goal is to push your body up with enough intensity that your hands lift off the floor.

, Do this by training on a heavy bag or punching the air.

, This is more evident with combination strikes. You can practice these in the air or on a punching bag. The more you do it, the faster you will get.

"
"
Take range into account when you're punching.,
Move your whole body.,
Punch from different angles.,
Get the timing right.",How to Punch Harder and Faster2," You should only throw a punch when you're in perfect range to do so with the most power possible. That means being close enough to deliver the punch without leaning or reaching forward. You should be able to connect with your arm outstretched, but not overextended.


When you have to lean forward to complete a punch, a significant portion of your punch's power is lost.
Practice using a punching bag until you're clear on how far you should stand from your target when you're punching. The distance will depend on the length of your arm and your range of motion.

, The importance of using your whole body to throw a punch, and not just your arm, can't be overstated. Although you can move your arm more quickly when you don't have to spin your body, your punch will be much less powerful if you use your arm alone.


Using your leg muscles will enable you to generate power and speed when you punch. The leg muscles are the largest and strongest in your body, and they should be behind every punch.
Remember not to lift your feet from the ground when you punch, since it throws you off balance and takes away some of your power. Stay quick on your feet, but keep them close to the ground.

, When you're in a fight, you won't punch the exact same way every time. Learn to determine which type of punch will be the most powerful in any given situation. Work on mastering the following basic punching angles in order to up your fighting ante:



Right or left cross: This is one of the most powerful punches. If you're punching with your right hand, your left foot should be dropped back; the opposite is true if you're punching with your left hand. Rotate your body sharply as you punch.Jab, or front punch: For this one, start with your punching foot forward. If you're punching with your right hand, your right foot should be forward, and the opposite is true if you're punching with your left hand. Shift your weight slightly forward and rotate your arm inward slightly as you punch. Be sure you don't have to overreach.Left or right hook: If you're throwing a left hook, your entire body should rotate to the right as you punch. Your right heel drops as your left heel lifts when you whip out your arm. Take the opposite approach if you're throwing a right hook.Uppercut: As you punch, turn your fist so that the palm is facing up, and punch from the waist upward in a diagonal motion. The punch is more powerful if you throw it on the diagonal.

, Since distance is so important when you want to throw your hardest punch, it's important to realize that not every punch is going to be your hardest. When you're a little out of range, you might have to throw some less powerful punches as you attempt to find the right positioning for a more powerful punch. The following circumstances are good times to get into position for your strongest punch:


When your opponent is in the act of punching, since he'll be more focused on that than on what you're doing.
When he's caught off guard. You can create this situation by punching in an irregular rhythm or using unexpected angles.
When he's stunned by a previous punch. Try starting with a quick jab to set yourself up for a powerful right cross.

"
"
Practice punching slow.,
Practice with a speed bag.,
Keep your strength training in check.,
Do cardio exercises.,
Try isometric training.",How to Punch Harder and Faster3," The most powerful punches aren't actually the fastest ones. Your arm can move more quickly than the rest of your body, so waiting for your body to catch up to a punch slows the punch down. Even though a powerful punch is a slower one, there will be moments when you have just enough time to execute a slow but extremely forceful punch. It's worth practicing punching at a slower speed so you can feel the full power that comes when you give your body time to get behind your fist.


Try punching at half speed when you're training. Force yourself to slow down and focus on using your leg muscles and torso to maximize your power.
Remember where that power came from when you speed things up. While you'd never punch at half speed during a match, you can focus on using your legs and torso to generate as much power as possible.

, Speed is as important as power, since if you're too slow your opponent will have time to throw a lot more punches. Train with a speed bag and see how fast your arms can fly. Be sure to use the proper form and remember to keep your thumb tucked away from your knuckles as you punch.


The biggest part of the speed bag, the belly, should be hung at the same height as your nose. Hanging it too high will cause you to use improper form when you're training.Focus on keeping the bag constantly in motion and always under your control. Start slow, alternating punching with your right and left arm. As you gain control, speed up your punching.

, Doing some amount of strength training is a good way to keep your body in the best shape possible, but strength training alone doesn't make you a stronger or quicker boxer. You need to train your muscles to punch by punching, not lifting weights. That said, it's a good idea to have a strength training routine that strengthens your legs and core for maximum power.


Try deadlifts to build overall body strength in your legs, torso and arms.

Squats, push ups, and pull ups are good exercises for building strength that translates well to better punches., The best cardio workouts for building the kind of fitness you need to be a good boxer are swimming and jumping rope. When you need a break from regular training, look to these cardio workouts as good alternatives. Running, biking, and other cardio workouts are beneficial, but they don't build strength that specifically aids your body when you want to punch hard during a boxing match.

, An isometric muscle contraction happens with the muscle contracts without changing length. You can practice this type of contraction by pushing as hard as you can against a stationary object, like a wall. Using isometric training to exercise your arms teaches your body to store strength that can be quickly whipped out at maximum capacity. Try this routine to work out your arms:


Make a fist and push it into a wall as hard as you can. Use your entire body to push your fist for 10 seconds, then repeat with the other hand. Try doing 15 reps and 3 sets per arm per training session. Doing this exercise every other day will strengthen your muscles.

Start with your hips parallel with the ground.,

Keep your feet only shoulder width apart.,
Position your feet at an angle.,
Widen your stance to be more defensive.,
Keep a more square stance to give your offense full potential.,
Balance both offense and defense with a compromise stance.,
Adjust as needed in order for your hips to turn properly.,
Keep your weight balanced.",How to Get in a Proper Boxing Stance," Make sure you feel solid over both feet.


If your hips are tilted then your already in an improper boxing stance. If you don't feel solid over both feet then your in an improper stance.
Your feet should not be in line with each other. For example your feet should not be one foot  in a direct line with the other foot.;
, Avoid having one foot in line with the other foot. Your front toe should be in line or off line with your rear heal. Also have your rear heal raised. Your feet should never cross with each other, since this is unbalanced.

, If your feet are too wide you will be locked in that position; if your feet are too close together then you will be off balance and easily knocked over. Your front leg should be stiff and your back leg bent. You can however be to wide for more power or your feet some what close for more speed, in punching. Adjust as needed.

, The front foot should be at about 45 degrees, turned inward, and your back foot 45 degrees as well. Put your weak hand in the front and your strong hand in the back. You can adjust the degrees of your feet position for your comfort just a little. Your back foot can be pointed directly to the side, if you're more comfortable this way.

, Stand wide with your front toe in line, cutting off your rear heal and widening your triangular stance. With this wide stance your upper body will be a small target. You may adjust this stance to your comfort. In this stance, your front 'shoulder will be pointing to your opponent. This wide stance will take some percentage off your offense power and some percentage off your balance. You will have more percentage towards your defense and take some percentage off your offense. This stance is not wrong. This stance would be more for the jabbing range, long range.

, This can be called shorting or making the triangular stance shorter instead of longer. Keep in mind that in this stance you will give up some percentage of your defense by squaring up your shoulders and giving some percentage to your offense. You will be in perfect balance. This stance is perfect for close range fighting, as you need to be in perfect balance at close range hook and uppercut range. This stance will give you also mobility to slip and to have power.

, You front shoulder should be in line with your front heal; your front foot should be about 25 degrees inward adjust as need for comfort. Your rear foot should be pointed directly at your opponent. Adjust as need for your comfort. Use this stance at close range. Keep in mind that your front toe and your rear heal should be about six inches apart from each other. This stance will give you good balance at close range. Widen or shorten your feet as needed. Widen for power; shorten for speed.

, You need your front leg to be stiff but not completely locked. It's a bit like a pole/hinge of a gate in the ground, so you can turn your hips properly when punching with the rear hand.


If you're punching with the lead hook your rear leg should be stiff but not locked, like a pole in the ground.

, Your weight should be 50 percent on one foot and 50 percent on the other foot. Doing this will aid you in moving on your footwork. This will help you move more effectively with your weight evenly distributed adjust as needed.


To move more effectively have your weight on the balls of your feet. If you want your weight to be on the heel of your front foot, keep your front leg stiff with the bones in your leg lined up. If your front leg is bent, you will have your weight across your entire front foot instead of your weight just on your heel, which can feel more balanced.

Fold the thumb down.,
Press into the gap.,
Slowly squeeze the fist.,
Turn your wrist.,
Extend your fist out at a right angle.,
Squeeze the fist as you strike.,
Rely on your strong knuckles.,
Relax slightly in between strikes.",How to Make a Fist," Hold your hand out straight and naturally extend all four fingers. Firmly press all four fingers together, leaving the thumb loose.Your hand should stick straight out as though you are extending it for a handshake.
Squeeze your fingers together with just enough pressure to turn them into a solid mass. They should not hurt or feel stiff, but there should be no spaces or gaps between them.;
, Bend your fingers into your palm, curling them under until the tip of each finger touches its corresponding base.


You are bending your fingers at the second joint during this step. Your nails should be clearly visible, and your thumb should remain loose at the side of your hand.

, Continue curling your fingers in the same direction so that the bottom knuckles are brought out and the finger joints are tucked in.


During this step, you will actually bend the third and outermost knuckles of your fingers. Your nails should partially disappear into your palm.
Your thumb should still hang loose during this step.

, Bend the thumb down so that it falls across the top halves of the index and middle fingers.


The exact placement of the thumb isn't too crucial, but it must be tucked under and should never hang loose.
If you press the tip of the thumb to the fold of the second knuckle of your index finger, you may actually minimize the risk of damaging the bones in your thumb.
Tucking the thumb under the index and middle finger works well and is a more common tactic, but you must make sure that it remains relaxed as you strike. A tense thumb will pull the bones at the base of your hand down and apart, which may increase your risk of developing a wrist injury.

, Using the thumb of your free hand, press into the gap created by the inner bend of the second knuckles. This test can help you determine how tight your fist currently is.


Make sure that you use the thumb and not the thumbnail.
You should be unable to press into the gap with your thumb, but the effort should not cause any pain.If you can break into the fist gap with your thumb, the fist is too loose.
If pressing the fist causes considerable pain, the fist is too tight.

, A second test you can use to gauge the tightness of your fist requires you to gradually squeeze your fist tighter and tighter. Use this test to give yourself an idea of how a properly formed fist should feel.


Make a fist and place your thumb against the knuckles of your index and middle fingers.
Squeeze your fist a little. The first two knuckles should tighten against each other, but the fist should still feel somewhat loose. This is the tightest your fist should feel as you strike with it.
Continue squeezing your fist until the thumb reaches the knuckle of your ring finger. You should feel the first knuckle of your index finger weaken, and your little finger will squeeze inward in a manner that causes the knuckle to collapse inward. At this point, the structure of your fist is too distorted to be effective or safe to use while striking.

, Turn your wrist so that your palm and folded thumb face the ground. The outer third knuckles of your fist should face up.


If you made your fist with your hand in a handshake position, you will need to turn your fist roughly 90 degrees when preparing to strike with it.
Make sure that the structure and tension of your fist remain consistent as you rotate it.

, Your wrist should remain straight as you strike with it, so much so that the front and top of your fist should roughly form a right angle.


Your wrist needs to remain firm and steady as you strike with your fist. If your wrist snaps back or twists at an angle, you may damage the bones and muscles there. Continuing to strike after your wrist has been damaged may result in permanent wrist injuries or injuries to your hand.

, Squeeze the knuckles together just before and during the moment of impact. Squeeze all of the bones withing the hand together at the same time.By squeezing your fist together, the bones can reinforce one another and work as a solid yet flexible mass. If your bones strike your target as a group of small, individual bones, they will be more brittle and prone to injury.
Avoid over-squeezing your hand, however. Doing so can cause the bones of your hand to buckle and collapse upon impact. If the shape of your fist becomes distorted when you squeeze your knuckles together, you may be squeezing too tightly.
Note that you should squeeze as close to the moment of impact as possible. Squeezing your fist too soon can slow you down and may make the punch less effective.

, Ideally, you should make contact with your target using the two strongest knuckles: those of your index and middle fingers.


In particular, it is the outer third knuckles of your index and middle fingers that you should focus on using.
The knuckles of your ring and pinky fingers are weaker, so you should avoid striking with them whenever possible. Doing otherwise may result in injuries and an ineffective striking technique.
If your fist is correctly formed and you are holding your wrist in the correct manner, it should be relatively easy to make contact with your target using only the two strongest knuckles.

, In between each strike, you can relax your fist enough to rest the muscles in your hand, but you should not allow the little finger to come loose at any point in the process.


Do not continue to squeeze the fist after the moment of impact, especially during an actual combat situation. Squeezing your fist after the moment of impact can make your swings slower and may leave you open for counterattacks.
Relaxing your fist can preserve the muscles in your hand and improve your endurance.

Add footwork to your speed drills and bag workouts.,
Watch other boxer's purely for their footwork.",How to Do Boxing Footwork," Step your lead foot (the foot you are most comfortable having in front) roughly 6-8"" in front of you. Your back foot is slightly behind you, toe to your side. Slightly bend both knees, with your weight evenly distributed over your hips. Keep your shoulders loose and relaxed, roughly over your knees.


Your feet are slightly greater than shoulder-width apart.Rest your chin on your chest and look forward through your eyebrows.;
, Your back should not be bent forward or backwards, but directly upwards. Your weight will be well distributed so that your nose never leans past your front knee. Many beginners will sink the front knee too much, causing them to bend and lean forward. Keep yourself upright.

, This is what people mean when they say ""always be on your toes."" You can move much quicker from the balls of your feet, the small knobs right before your toes begin. Your back heel, in particular, should never touch the ground.If you were to draw a line from you straight in front of you, your front foot would be at a 45-degree angle. Your back foot should be almost 90-degrees.With every movement, always land and push off starting from the balls of your feet.

, Push off your back foot and step forward with the lead foot. As you do, slide your back foot along so that you return to your athletic stance. Neither foot should ever come very far off the ground.


Keeping one foot on the mat at all times allows you to spring, counterattack, and pivot quickly in a fight.
Reverse this motion to move backwards -- stepping with the back foot and sliding the lead foot backwards to follow.

, If you're going left, step with the left foot while sliding the right to follow. You want a big, explosive push off your first step. Think of the second foot as gliding, not stepping. Just reverse it to go the opposite direction. If you're an orthodox boxer (right-handed, left-foot forward), your back foot moves first when going to the right.


Focus on keeping your spine straight while moving. Don't lean wildly or take yourself off balance -- your opponent will capitalize on your loss of balance in a fight.

, Tensing up will make it harder to pivot, turn, or move smoothly. Keep your shoulders loose and your hands free by your sides. Just focus on not tensing and contracting your muscles. Instead, try to feel smooth and fluid as you move -- you'll feel the difference in your legs as well.You don't have to drop your hands to relax your upper body. Let your arms sway a bit, as if you were walking.

, There is an imaginary line between your right and left foot that should not be bent or crossed.Crossing your feet takes your off balance and makes it hard to change directions -- making you an easy target for opponents. Keep this invisible line between your feet solid to keep your footwork solid.

, Range is the distance where you can land a punch on the opponent. Footwork is how you position yourself to attack, prepare to dodge and evade, and dictate the speed of the fight. The best way to do this is to ""move in and out."" Dance at the edge of your range so that you only need a small step in to attack and small step out to dodge. Short, quick steps are the hallmark of the best fighter's footwork.


The movement should move you no more than 6-8 centimeters., A pivot changes your direction on a dime, throwing off your opponent's line of attack and opening up new ones for you. It is a small but absolutely indispensable skill to practice regularly. Work on keeping your weight over both feet and your hands up in front of you. It seems simple -- but the best boxers can pivot fluidly and almost instantly:


Push off your back foot.
Use the momentum to swivel your front toe 45 degrees to either side, changing your direction.
Quickly slide your back foot so that it is behind your front heel.
Once you get good at a basic pivot, work on taking a small step, then pivoting as the foot lands. Make sure you get back to your stance quickly., Moving diagonally will dramatically increase your ability in the ring. But that is only if you do it well. The basics of footwork become twice as important: keep your spine straight, your movements short, and, most importantly, don't cross your feet. For an orthodox boxer (left foot forward), moving diagonally Northwest (forward and left) or Southeast (back and right) is easy:



Moving forward and to the left:

Push off your back foot with a sharp, explosive step forward and sideways. Move along the angle of your feet, as if your insteps pointed the correct direction for you.
Step your front foot forward 2-3"" to the front and 2-3"" to the left.
Glide your back foot into place, taking care not to lean forward.



Moving backwards and to the right:

Push off the front foot with a sharp step.
Step your back foot 2-3"" to the back and right of your body.
Quickly glide your back foot forward and sideways to return to your stance., This is also a great technique to get an attacking lane open, as a righty can move diagonally back to expose the center of their opponent's body. However, moving off of your lead foot without crossing your feet isn't easy. Remember to keep the motions short and quick. For a right-handed boxer, whose left foot is forward:



Moving forward and to the right:

Push off your back foot, aiming it forward and to the left.
Use your front foot like a brake, pushing off it to counteract the push from the back foot and move you diagonally.
Step forward and to the right, almost like you were hopping.
Glide the back foot into place.



Moving backwards and to the left:

Push off of your front foot as if you were trying to step directly backwards
Use your back foot almost like a brake, pivoting on it to move diagonally backwards.
Step backwards and to the left with the back foot, only moving a few inches. It is easiest to move back and left as opposed to perfectly diagonal.
Glide your front foot back into position., This classic boxing workout is a classic for a reason. Jump rope is great for explosive, quick-moving feet that can pivot on a dime and step and slide for days. Try to get 100 jumps or more in every single training session.


As you get better, practice one-footed, double-time, and hopping over the rope.

, A simple workout ladder is all you need. Work on moving through it quickly, touching only the balls of your feet to the ground. To get the most out of an exercise ladder, you should stick to patterns, moving your feet through with different techniques each run-through. Try:


Touching both feet in every space.
Touching only one foot in every space.
Touching each foot twice in every space.
Side-stepping through the ladder.
Moving up two spaces, back one, up two, back one, etc., A big, explosive step comes from big, explosive legs. Get a box that is roughly shin or knee height. Keep your shoulders over your knees and spine straight. Bend down from the knees and leap with both legs onto the box. Then jump off. Repeat 10-12 times, for three sets. As you get better, you can add variety to get even stronger:


Make the box higher
""March"" up the box, stepping up and down with each foot.
Work on single-leg jumps., Shadowboxing is when you mime a real fight, at speed, by yourself. It is an incredible workout, but only if you do it well. Focus on perfect technique, especially as your get tired. You will fight how you practice, so use this time to get perfect footwork before your opponent even steps in the ring., There is no reason to sit flat-footed while hitting the bag or practicing punches. No matter what skill you're training, incorporate footwork into the mix. Throw three punches against the heavy bag, then move in and out before throwing three more. Pivot every 30 seconds on the speed bag and switch arms. The more you can bring footwork into your other skill training, the better boxer you'll be.

, When you put on a match, ask yourself who has the better footwork? Who moves smoothly across the ring and who seems to lumber? How do great boxers move their feet to react on offense vs defense? Watching another boxer's footwork, paying attention exclusively below the knees, is a great way to see how important movement is in a fight."

Assess the situation before throwing a punch.,
Know your punching range.",How to Throw a Hook Punch1," If you do not observe your surroundings, a punch will not help you much against a crew of people twice your size.;
, A hook punch is most effective at close range. If your opponent is far away from you, close up the distance between you and your opponent before executing a hook punch.


If you try to throw a hook too far from your opponent, they can block it, leaving you wide open for a punch to the face.
Practice your punches and know how close or far away from your opponent you need to be for your punches to be effective.

Remember that the hand formation described in this article is different than those typically taught by most karate systems.,
To avoid these problems, you should use the hand formation taught in 'Atemi Wazi' as in Judo Kodokan.,
To learn this hand formation, just put your hand on the table with all your fingers together.,
It will resemble the Vulcan greeting hand gesture first initiated by Mr. Spock in ""Star Trek."",
Practice striking pads to build up shock resistance in the joints of the fingers.

",How to Perform an Eye Stab," In those other systems either the index finger alone, as 'Ippon-nukite' (one-finger piercing hand), strikes an eye, or the index finger strikes one eye while the middle finger strikes the other eye as in 'Nihon-nukite' (two-finger piercing hand). If you strike with such a hand and miss or are blocked, you are in big trouble. You can have sprained, twisted fingers and you will not be able to make a fist.;
, In this hand formation eyes are struck with the tips of the middle finger and the ring finger. The middle finger is braced by the index finger and the ring finger is braced by the little finger. All fingers are slightly bent inward (toward the palm of the hand).

,


Then, with your other hand, spread its middle and ring fingers.
Try to keep your fingers from coming back together.
Then try to spread them using the muscles of your hand while helping yourself with the other hand.
Do it several times, each time with less help from the other hand.

Try not to be violent.,
Be prepared.,
Act confident.,
Tire out your opponent.,
Watch for lack of speed and move.,
Finish it.",How to Do Well in a Fight1," If you have the opportunity to do so, walk away from the fight. The best way to do well in a fight is to not fight at all. However, if you can't avoid being in a fight, acting like you don't care whether or not you fight can be a diffuser of sorts. Most of the time, guys who want to fight really just want someone to provoke. If you can't be provoked, they might lose interest.


At first act like you are not going to fight and let them take a few punches. Act like you couldn't care less and that it doesn't hurt. Sometimes this can make the attacker back away but sometimes it provokes them more.;
, Once you have successfully made it clear that you don't care whether you fight or not, your attacker might try to provoke you by laughing at your non-violent attitude. Make sure you are ready with many techniques and that you are prepared to feel pain.

, Even if you've never been in a fight before, you should still act confident. Confidence can actually be a good diffuser. Act like you've been fighting everyday of your life--you could couldn't care less whether you fought this opponent. As your opponent is getting ready, throw in a yawn then take your jacket and give it to your mate. (No matter how cold it is this technique works well with all attackers.)

, Roll up your sleeve and make sure you're prepared to feel pain. Imagine you're a brick and no punches or kicks can break you! Do not hit them first. Keep arms distance away and jump around smoothly and swiftly to confuse your component. If you see them go to punch your head.. Duck! Circle them and Dodge!

, Once you see them hesitate charge and punch them in the jaw, tensing your arm and using your shoulder for more power. Then quickly knee them anywhere you can, preferably in the back of the knee or stomach.

, When you opponent doubles over, do the moves that will end the fight. A few knees in the face or solid punch in the nose or eye usually puts them in too much pain to carry on. Take this opportunity to flee but don't run. Strut off but fast enough not to give your beaten up enemy a chance to recover. Avoid future conflict with this person and attempt to keep the fight quiet.

Take a proper boxing stance.,
Keep a high guard.",How to Throw a Hook Punch2," In boxing, proper form is extremely important. Put both of your legs parallel to your shoulders, then bring your most dominant foot one half of a step back and slightly bend your knees. This will provide you with a pivot point. , Keep your fists in front of your face. Your hands should be lined up a bit outside of your eyes and a few inches away from your face. In this way you can also defend a punch being thrown at you.

, The hook is best executed when done in a fluid motion, using both the upper and lower body to follow through with the punch. , Hitting the jaw with a hook can cause an instant knock-out of your opponent, and hitting the temple can cause an instant knock-out or death in desperate situations and if executed perfectly. , This is a perfect time to execute a combo by throwing another punch at your target while they are off balance.

Try to diffuse the situation.,
Keep a close eye on your opponent's movements.,
Keep a bit of distance between yourself and your opponent.,
Do not let your guard down.,
Tire your opponent out.,
Go on the attack.,
Finish the fight.",How to Do Well in a Fight2," The best way to avoid getting hit is by avoiding a fight entirely. Try to calm the guy down. Swallow your pride and apologize if you unknowingly did something that offended your attacker. While apologizing or calming the guy down, try to keep a look of confidence about you. Confidence can be intimidating.

, Don't look away even for a second--the one moment you look away may be the moment that he decides to go in for a punch. Instead, follow his movements with your eyes. Use your peripheral vision to keep track of where you are in the space that you are fighting in--you wouldn't want to trip over something.

, If he has to stretch to hit you, chances are he won't take that challenge. Instead, keep a bit of space between you and your opponent so that you can determine when you want to go in for a punch. By controlling the distance between you, you can begin to control the fight.

, Whether or not you are the one who instigated this fight, you will have to participate if it is in self-defense. An important part of avoiding getting hit is staying as alert as possible during the fight. Do not let yourself get distracted.

, You may be able to win the fight without ever having to throw a punch (or taking one). Simply keep moving, forcing your opponent to really work to keep up with you. Chances are, if you are really determined, you will wear your opponent out before he has a chance to attack.

, If you can't get out of the fight and it doesn't seem like your opponent is going to let up, you might consider going on the attack. This could be a punch or, if you are defending yourself, an end-it move like a kick or knee to the groin.

, Whether this means tiring your opponent out, going in for a big hit, or simply walking away, you will need to end the fight. Assess your situation and choose the best option.

Practice!",How to Perform a Taekwondo Front Kick," In Taekwondo, kicks are launched from the standard L-stance, where one foot will be placed in front of the other. It’s up to you which foot is in front, depending on whether the left or right side of your body is dominant.Your back leg will be your kicking leg, as it's going to snap out and perform the strike. Your front leg is your supporting leg, as it's going to be holding all of your body's weight as you pick your kicking leg off the ground and kick.
If you favor your right hand, your right leg will most likely be your dominant leg. You'll want it to be your back leg, or kicking leg. If you favor your left hand, make your left leg your back leg, or supporting leg.
Your front and back leg should be about one and half shoulder-widths apart. To reach this measurement, take your stance with your feet directly under your shoulders, then move your supporting leg front one step and your kicking leg back one step.;
, The name “L-Stance” comes from the L shape that you’ll make with your feet in this stance. Your front foot should face forward, and your back foot and leg should be turned out 90 degrees, placed about one foot behind the front foot. Your forward-facing supporting foot should be facing towards your target, getting ready to guide your kick in the right direction.

, With your feet in proper L stance, your body won’t be facing forward: it will be facing slightly outward in the direction that your back foot is pointed. You’ll want to be looking ahead, however, so point your head towards your opponent or target and focus on its direction.


Face your trunk outward. Since your kicking foot is pointed about 90 degrees away from your body and your supporting foot is facing forward, this will leave your body pointing about 45 degrees diagonal towards your target. Try to keep an even smaller profile by rotating your trunk towards your back foot. The less your opponent can see of your body, the less they can hit.
Face your head forward. While your torso is rotated at a 45 degree angle, you still need to be able to see! Face your head forward and keep your eye fixed on your target. This will help guide your kick.

, In most Taekwondo ready stances, you’ll want your arms out in front of you in a blocking position. Even though you won’t be punching, hold your hands in fists facing each other about a foot in front of your chest, with your elbows bent at 90 degree angles. Your arms will help you balance as you kick., Make sure about 75 percent of your weight is resting on your front foot. This will be important when you kick: you want as much weight off of your back foot as possible so that you can snap it upward quickly.

, Lift it high enough so that the instep of your back foot is about level with your front knee. Hold this stance and get comfortable with your balance. You don’t want to fall over!, Your knee should be slightly above the exact point that you are aiming for, with your kicking foot stretched to become parallel to the ground. You may need to pull your arms closer to your body as you lift higher to maintain your balance.

, Your back foot is the foot that you’ll be using to strike the target, so you’ll want to make sure that it’s in the right position. As you point your knee towards the target, pull your toes upward so that your foot is parallel to the ground, ready to deal the blow.

, Snap your leg up at the knee with your toes pointed up. You want to get a lot of momentum going here: the more force and speed you put into the snap, the more force you’ll hit your target with. , You want to hit the target with either the ball of your foot or your instep. Both are acceptable, and up to you or your instructor’s preference. The point of the kick is to cover as much area as possible to make as large an impact as you can. Just make sure that you’re not striking with your toes only! You could break or sprain them., Return your foot back to the starting position, with your kicking foot and supporting foot in the “L-Stance”. Regain your balance and make sure that your arms are back down to their original position as well.

, Make sure to repeat the steps in solo practice and in formal sparring matches. Work on your balance, your form, and the speed with which you snap your kick.

Consider different types of gyms.,
Search online.,
Check out multiple gyms.,
Evaluate the equipment.,
Talk with trainers.,
Look for professional fighters.,
Pay attention to the memorabilia on the walls.,
Attend a local fight.",How to Go to a Boxing Gym1," Think about why you want to start boxing and what you expect out of your boxing experience. Are you interested in becoming a professional boxer or just looking to get in better shape? If you are simply looking to get into shape, a boxing gym may be a good choice. However, you can also take boxing classes at your local YMCA or fitness club. If you want to become an amateur or professional boxer, you will need to join a boxing gym and receive personal training.If you are a beginner, taking a few fitness boxing classes might be a good way to test your interest in the sport.;
, Once you have determined what kind of gym you want to join, you should begin looking around for gyms. Do a simple Google search of boxing gyms in your area and visit a few websites. Many gyms will give you a rudimentary list of their services and what you might expect at their gym.Be sure to check out the fees of prospective gyms. Most pure boxing gyms only charge a small monthly fee. However, you will also have to pay for a trainer.
If you want to be a professional fighter, look for gyms that advertise their professional and amateur fighters. You should also be able to find info about trainers as well.

, Once you have checked out some places online, you should go visit the prospective gyms in person. Get a feel for the atmosphere and determine which place is the most appealing. Be sure to visit multiple gyms and try not to join the first gym you visit. You want to weigh your option.You should take advantage of day passes or trial memberships to test out individual gyms. Working out in a gym is the best way to determine if you will like being there.

, A high-quality boxing gym will have all of the equipment that you will need to train as a fighter. The gym should have heavy bags, speed bags, double-end bags, a ring, a timer, and free weights. If any of these things are not available, you might want to consider another gym.However, do not be quick to judge the quality of the equipment. New equipment does not necessarily indicate the quality of a gym. A good gym has equipment that is worn from use but still taken care of.

, While you are checking out the various gyms, make a point to talk to prospective trainers. Ask the gym staff or the person at the front door if there are any trainers that you can meet. When you talk to the trainers, ask them about their fees, hours, and how many clients they have. This will give you an idea of how much attention your trainer will give you and how much it will cost to work with them.You should take advantage of free trial classes to work with potential trainers. Try to find someone that like and who motivates you.
You will also want to find a gym that has enough trainers available to give you the time and attention you need.Be sure to ask potential trainers questions like “How long have you been training?” and “Who did you train under?” You should also ask about how many clients they are currently training.

, A quality boxing gym will have a clientele of professional fighters. Start online and look for gyms posting about their amateur and professional fighters. When you visit the gyms, look for local pros using the ring and sparring with their training team. A stable of good fighters is a strong indication of a gym’s quality.The downside of training at a high profile gym is that the pros will get priority use of the equipment over regular joes like yourself. If you want to have regular access to the ring and sparring equipment, you might want to go for a middle of the road gym.

, Most serious boxing gyms will post memorabilia from their fighters on the walls. These will be newspaper clippings, fight boards, and pictures of the fighters. The more accomplished the fighters, the more mementos there will be on the walls. Although it is not a guarantee of a gym’s quality, you can feel confident that a good gym will produce good fighters., If you want to gauge the quality of a gym, you might want to evaluate fighters that trained there. One of the best ways to do that is by attending some fights and paying attention to how various gyms’ fighters fare in the ring. If a certain gym’s fighters seem to do particularly well, you can reasonably assume that they are getting good training."

,, While positioning your right arm, aim your left arm forward about a 16 inches (40.6 cm), with a little downward bend. Poise your left arm's fingers to resemble an upright claw, fingers facing outward.

,, While kneeling, you must raise your left leg, and pivot on your right leg until your body 180 degrees to the left, so your body is aiming the completely opposite way from before. This should be done reasonably fast. Plant your front leg down, just like it was before. You should be facing the target positioned behind you.

, as loud as possible. If you were close enough to the foe, you will have punched him with the pure power of awesome.

, Saluting after punching and quoting ""Show me your moves!"" is also highly advised.

Join the gym.,
Pick some classes.,
Sign up for body weight exercises.",How to Go to a Boxing Gym2," Once you pick a gym, you will need to become a member. You will need to pay a monthly fee to use the gym's facilities. Compared to a fitness center, this fee is significantly lower. However, you may have to pay additional fees for specific classes. You will also have to pay extra for a trainer if you decide to go that route.Typically, the only information that a gym will need is your address, phone number, and an email address.

, If you join a gym that offers classes, you should enroll in them as soon as possible. Many gyms offer introductory classes that will teach you the basics of boxing, such as footwork and stance. Some gyms require that their students take these classes before they start training. Look at the gym’s offerings and pick the classes that fit your schedule and skill level.If you are paying to work with a trainer, you may not need classes. In fact, a trainer may not appreciate someone else giving you boxing training.

, Because professional boxers have to maintain their weight in order to fight at specific weight classes, they closely control their body weight. Besides typical classes on fighting technique, your gym may also offer courses about dieting and proper weight management. A good weight management course will help you manage your weight and eat healthier.You should avoid any unhealthy weight management practices like purging, fasting, or dehydration. These can cause significant health problems."

Get a trainer.,
Buy the gear.,
Learn to wrap your hands.,
Find a sparring partner.,
Watch the professionals.,
Practice the basics at home.",How to Go to a Boxing Gym3," Picking a trainer may go hand-in-hand with determining what gym to join. Ideally, you will join a gym because you find a trainer that you like. A trainer will put you on a workout regimen and help you hone your technique. They are essential to your progression as a fighter.Observe different trainers at the gym and see if you think any of them would work with your boxing style. If so, ask them if they could be your trainer or sign up for training sessions with them at the front desk.

, Once you have a boxing home and some instruction, you should get the appropriate gear. You will need a quality pair of boxing gloves, a good jump rope, and some hand wraps. If you are sparring, you will also need head gear, a groin guard, and a gum shield. Finally, you may also want to invest in a good pair of boxing shoes.Many gyms have gear available for their clients to use. However, it is often worn out and unhygienic to use.
Talk with your trainer about what gear they think you should get.

, Applying boxing wraps will help you avoid seriously injuring your hands. Your trainer will likely teach you how to apply your wraps. In fact, you should have an experienced person wrap your hands for you until you are competent at the task.Wearing hand wraps gives your bones and joints extra support when you punch solid objects.

, After you have spent some time at the gym, look for people that are at your skill level. You should get to know these people and practice sparring with them. Sparring is a great way to get some in-ring experience while working on your speed, accuracy, timing, and technique.Your trainer may also hook you up with people to spar with.
Sparring with a significantly more experienced fighter may be an unpleasant experience. They will likely wear you out and beat you up a little.

, The professional fighters in your gym are a great resource for learning more about the sport. Pros will demonstrate their elite skill and knowledge of the sport. Take every advantage you have to watch them spar, work the bags, and practice their footwork. Watching them move will help you hone your own technique., You can practice your footwork and shadowbox anywhere, as long as you have enough space. If you want to get serious about boxing at home, you should buy a 75- to 100-pound punching bag. This will allow you to do some basic punching and footwork when you are not at the gym.If you are already participating in training sessions multiple times a week, do not do extra bag training at home. You can overwork your hands, resulting in injuries. Instead, emphasize cardio workouts and strength training.

Stand in a fighting stance.,
If you want a faster kick, you will use your front foot (secondary leg).,
Raise your kicking-leg's knee so your thigh is parallel to the ground, about hip/waist level.,
Kick your leg, snapping it forward quickly.,
Unsnap your leg so your thigh is once again parallel to the ground.

,
Set your leg back on the ground.,
Variations in execution include height, power, speed, and whether or not you return your foot to the ground.",How to Kick (in Martial Arts)1," The preferred fighting stance differs between different disciplines, but the general rule is that your dominant leg is behind your other leg - the dominant leg's toe pointed to its side. Your secondary leg is in front, its toe pointed straight forward. Your torso is generally facing the direction of your dominant leg (righties' bodies will face right & vice versa). Your hands can be in a guard position or relaxed. For a kick, your hands are (obviously) less important.;
, If you want a more powerful front kick, use your back leg (primary)

, This is called chambering. Breathe in as you do this.

, With a front kick you can use the ball of your foot or your instep as a striking surface. As you kick, rapidly release the air in your lungs. Doing so will ensure that if you are doing kicking drills, you don't forget to breathe (which is easier to forget than it sounds!). Remember, breath in when you contract, breath out when you expand. This also will relax your body, allowing for proper technique, because holding air in means your muscles are too tense, and you are trying to control your kick too much, which weakens the kick, slows it down and will tire you out faster.

,, If you used your secondary leg for the kick, it will go back where it started. If you used your back leg, place it down as if it were your secondary leg (switching sides on your stance)

, Many disciplines have techniques where you do multiple kicks with one foot, and it never returns to the ground.

"
"Stand in a fighting stance

,
Bring your back leg up so your knee is near your chest, and your foot is somewhere near your hips (early on, don't worry about bringing it up quite this high, but the goal is to have the sole of your foot facing down, and the outside (""knife side"") of your foot facing your target).,
Kick your leg such that your kicking foot will draw a straight line from the cocked position to its destination.,
Return to the cocked position.,
Return your foot to the ground, in front of you.",How to Kick (in Martial Arts)2,", This is sometimes called the ""cocked position"" because you are ready to fire.

, Kick with the heel of your foot, or if you are more advanced, the knife side of your foot. As you kick, rotate on the ball of your foot so that your heel ends pointed toward your target.

, Simultaneously rotate back to your starting position on the ball of your foot.

, Your back leg now should have been your front leg before the kick, and vice versa.

,
Set your leg down so that it is now your front leg (if it wasn't already) Or you make sure that your leg returns to it's initial position, this should be rapidly as soon as you've delivered your full force to the target.

,
If done properly, you should be able to throw your body into your kick without throwing your weight off center and losing balance.",How to Kick (in Martial Arts)4,", Using your front leg will be more sudden, but your back leg is significantly more powerful, and more aggressive, because you step forward. Instead of holding your calf vertical with your knee pointing upwards, drop your knee as if you were doing a front kick sideways. To do this properly, it is very important that you turn your hips into the kick because it is all in the hips! This is the cocked position

, You will use the ball of your foot, your shin or your instep to strike with (again, depending on where you wish to strike) Remember to always kick through your target.

,,, It will also be smooth in execution, not as robotic as the steps make it out to be."
"
Keep your rear leg and your front leg forward.",How to Kick (in Martial Arts)5," Lift your leg and use the Shin and kick straight. If one uses the instep or ball of the foot, it can really damage them if they do the next step properly. While the leg is in air, do not snap, but follow through. Karate experts would not agree for they can pull one off of their balance. Really, if the height is going in and there is little weight off the front."

Raise both fists to just below eye level to place them in position to both block strikes as well as to execute offensive movements.
Keep your rear elbow tight to the body without touching it. It will protect your solar plexus and ribs.Your lead arm should be slightly in front of you. This serves to protect your solar plexus and ribs, but also positioned to quickly interfere with strikes coming toward your face as well as to jab.Keep your chin down to protect your nose and eyes from strikes that get past your defense.;
, Keep your feet about shoulder width apart with your non-dominant foot forward. Keep your weight balanced between both feet.
Angle both feet slightly in the same direction (slightly off from direct center).
Your rear heel should be elevated slightly to move quickly for striking or pivoting. , In order to execute a flying sidekick, you’ll need to be able to protect yourself until given the opportunity.


Spend enough time in your fighting stance that your body comfortably returns to it after each move or technique you execute.
Keep your guard up at all times to avoid counter strikes.Avoid lowering your arms to maintain balance.

, Keep your guard up at all times, particularly while moving toward and away from your opponent.


Take 12−15 inch (−38 cm) steps with your hands up in a protective guard.Only move one foot at a time to ensure you maintain balance even under striking.
Always complete your movements oriented toward your opponent. , As is the case with all martial arts movements, protecting yourself is paramount in order to effectively execute the technique.


Be careful not to lower your guard while you execute the kick. It is not uncommon for people to use their arms to aid in balance, but that can open you up to counter strikes.
Do not alter your stance or movements as you prepare to execute a flying sidekick. You could tip your opponent off about your intent, which is commonly called, “telegraphing.”, In order to properly execute a flying sidekick, you need to be in the correct position versus your opponent.


Angle your body so your opponent is ahead of you.
Create a few feet of distance by backing up or striking your opponent with a front kick just above the knee to force them to retreat.

, A jumping sidekick requires that you leave the ground. There are two variations in how to execute this portion of the technique separated by which foot you jump with.From your defensive stance, jump up and toward your opponent.
The differentiation between techniques involves jumping with either your lead or rear foot, so neither is technically incorrect. Decide which foot to use to lead your jump based on your comfort and the situation.
Retract your legs into your body to protect yourself and prepare to execute the kick.

, Once airborne, execute the kick as your jump closes the gap between you and your opponent.


The striking surface for this technique should be the leading cutting edge of your foot, but using the ball or heel of the same foot should not result in injuring you.
Never attempt to make contact with your opponent higher than their chest. Heads move quickly and are difficult targets and over extending could reduce your ability to regain your balance as you land. , After striking your opponent, quickly get back into position to protect yourself. Lower your rear (non-striking) leg immediately after making contact with your opponent.
Immediately retract your extended leg and plant it firmly on the ground in your traditional defensive stance.
Ensure your guard is still up to protect yourself from counter strikes.

, If you fail to connect with your opponent, it is extremely important that you regain your balance quickly and enter into a defensive stance.


Lower your non-striking leg as soon as you recognize that your kick did not connect.
Plant both feet firmly and ensure your guard is up to protect your face and torso from any incoming strikes.Create distance between you and your opponent by backing away or executing another series of strikes while increasing the gap between you.

, If you fail to land the kick, you run the risk of your opponent catching your leg. This puts you at serious risk for further strikes or a single-leg takedown.


Immediately drop your weight onto your opponent’s thigh. This may break his or her grip and will prevent your opponent from kneeing you.Get control of your opponent’s free arm with your outside hand, and use the arm on the same side as your caught leg to grab the back of his or her head.

Begin in your basic fighting/guarding stance with your kicking leg back.,
Assuming the above right leg back stance, turn your body to your right until you are facing directly away from your target.,
Look over your right shoulder as you lift your right knee to your chest.

,
With your ankle bent, drive your right heel straight toward your target using your body weight to add power to your attack.

,
Finish with your right leg now in front and assume a fighting/guarding stance.

",How to Perform a Back Kick," One common stance is to have your right leg back and a few inches to your right, your body turned almost all of the way to the side and your hands up (right hand by your chin and left 12-16 inches in front of your left shoulder).;
, During this movement you should pivot on your left foot. Your right foot should slide slightly to what is now your right, and it should be further from your target than your left foot.

Figure out if you are a right lead puncher or left lead puncher:


Most fighters are left lead punchers because they like having their strong hand in the back, which is perfectly fine.,
Improve your strength through physical workouts:


Make sure to train in the correct way with the sole purpose of improving your striking power.,
Focus on basic and direct techniques while training:


When the actual fight begins whether it being a sports fight or street fight, adrenalin will cause your brain to only remember instinctive techniques.,
Improve your footwork:


Footwork is the fundamental of everything in standing fights so make sure that you are both comfortable and natural moving around on your feet.,
Work on your speed.,
Get stronger.",How to Improve Your Punches and Strikes," But keep in mind that whichever hand is in the front will also be closer to the opponent. Therefore is it not logical to put the strong hand in the front so that it will reach the target faster?;
, This can be done through explosive movements when doing exercises such as push ups or pull ups. Make sure to train both biceps and triceps since it is important to have the proper strength both directions.

, Instinctive techniques will in most cases be basic techniques such as Jab, Cross, Hook punch, Straight punch, Roundhouse kick and Side kick. So do yourself a favor and train those basic techniques until they are as perfect as can be.

, Another important element of using footwork is proper function of the rear foot by using it as a spring. This is done by slightly raising the heel of the ground which will help you use explosive movement with your foot to penetrate the target more deeply.

, Speed is important when throwing a strike and there are a lot of factors that will determine the speed of your technique. Here are a couple of examples:


Train your reaction speed: This is simply how fast your brain is able to see when a target appears. One way to train this is through using focus mitts and having a training partner quickly flash them at you while your job is to hit it as soon as you see it. Reaction drills is important because it allows your brain to quickly send the correct signals to your muscles whether it being to attack or defend.
Train yourself in target recognition: This is learning how recognize the correct targets when they appear. one way to train this is by using focus mitts and having a training partner flash them at you while he mixes up the angle and position of the mitt. Then it is up to you to use proper type of technique to reach the target. Target recognition is important because it allows your brain to be faster in deciding which technique to use when a target opens up on the opponent.
Train initiation speed: This is basically how fast you are able to start a movement after your brain recognizes an opening. This can be trained through explosive strength training (see step #2) and relaxation exercises. Relaxation exercises are basically when you relax the muscles in a certain limb and then quickly activating them through a tight and fast movement. Training this will help you get to your target more quickly.
Train the speed in your movement: This is the actual movement of the fist going from point A to point B. The main way to train this is by learning to always use direct techniques. Repetition of a technique will also improve movement speed because it will get your body used to the movement.
Train your retraction speed: This is simply being able to get the fist back into guard position as soon as the target has been hit. This can be trained be doing any type of drill involving having to strike at a target whether it being by striking a punching bag or focus mitt. Retracting the punch is important because if the hand or kick is left extended there will be a greater chance of the opponent grabbing on to you. It is also important to get the hand back so that it can help defend you against punches.
Train your snapping speed: A snapping motion is one of the fastest ways to deliver a punch, however if not trained properly it will lack in power. Snapping can be done by simply relaxing the limb and then quickly thrusting the strike in a whipping motion. Snapping strikes are mainly used against specific weaker targets on the opponents body and is an excellent method for dazing the opponent right before delivering the final blow.
Train yourself in not telegraphing: Non-telegraphing means to not show the opponent that you are about to punch. There are two parts to non-telegraphing which is before and after the initiation of the strike. Before the strike is initiated it is important not to telegraph with the body since this is very dangerous towards a skilled fighter. After the initiation it is important not to use big motions since it makes it easier to see where the punch is coming from. If non-telegraphic motions are used then the strike will look faster to the opponent than it really is simply because it is harder for him/her to see it.

, Having power in your punches is also important. Here are a couple of skills to think about when training power:


Improve your muscle strength: Improving the right type of muscles will help improve the force of the punch (see step #2). Strength can be used to push back the opponent when throwing the strike.
Train in delivering higher power: Power is determined by the force and velocity of your strike. One way to train power is by using a heavy bag. Your mass will also determine the power of your strike. The difference of a strength punch and a power punch can clearly be felt. A strength emphasized punch will hurt the surface of your body and push you back and a power emphasized punch will be felt in the core of your body while only pushing you back slightly depending on the amount of power.
Use momentum: Momentum is when power is obtained through a continuous motion such as generating power in a punch by rotating the body. Momentum can be created by rotating the shoulders or rotating the hip.
Learn how to use alignment: Alignment is when the joints are locking out right before the strike. It is very important not to fully extend the joints since this might cause injury to your joints if your opponent pushes back hard enough at impact. Alignment is mainly used during straight punches or kicks, but this doesn't mean that it cannot be used to a small extend during an angled strike.

Grip your sword with your dominant hand (in this article it will be referred to as the right hand and the non-dominant as the left henceforth).,
With the left hand, grip the sword tightly with the pinky, ring, and middle finger, the others should have a semi-tight grip.,
Hold your sword so that the pommel is right above your bellybutton (don't rest it on the stomach, keep it a little ways out) and point the tip somewhere between the sternum and throat.,

Face your opponent and bend your knees slightly, placing your left foot forward if you are right handed, or your right foot forward if you are left handed.,
Raise both your hands up to the sides of your temples, palms open towards your opponent, ready to block your opponents strikes by hitting his hands and legs with your palms.

,
To avoid being knocked out by your opponent before you are able to perform the strike, you should keep your chin down towards your chest and roll your shoulders slightly forward.

,
With legs slightly bent, explode your body forward off your back foot, towards your opponents head and wrap your hands around the back of your opponent's neck,and do not lock your fingers together but rather cup the crown of his/her head and drive your elbows into the collar bones of your opponent for leverage as you pull down the head.,
Keeping your hands locked together on the crown of the opponents head the entire time, pull down on the head and neck of your opponent, pulling it towards your dominant knee, while simultaneously exploding your dominant knee forward as you thrust your hips inward to strike the face or body of your opponent with your knee.

Make sure you can properly do a Hook Kick in the first place.,
Get in the fighting stance.,
Fists clenched tight and strong, legs digging deep into the ground stable, get ready to turn.,
To spin more quickly and confidently, therefore having more momentum and power in your kick, begin to swing your arms around with the stepping of your non-kicking leg in front of you.








,
Now, you've spun about 180 degrees and are looking over your kicking leg's shoulder.,
Now comes the actual kick.,
Now back to the Spinning Hook Kick.,
Once you have done this, bring your kicking foot back to your side, and your other leg will naturally pivot along with it but this time as you are back in stance, your right leg will be behind you and your left leg will be in front of you.








,
From here you can finish your opponent off with a roundhouse kick to your opponents gut-better your opponents head again.",How to Perform a Spinning Hook Kick," If you don't and just want to get straight to the Spinning Hook Kick, then read on for it will also contain how to do a Hook Kick, intertwined with the spinning aspects of this effective and efficient move.






;
, For this kick, I found, it's better if your knees are bent a little more and if your legs are wider apart because that way you will be able to kick a lot higher. How much you lean back on your non-kicking leg also has influence on how high your kick will be.








, If you're gonna kick with your right leg, step in with your left leg. If you're gonna kick with your left leg, step in with your right leg. If you kick with your right leg, your right leg should be out in front of you and your back or left leg trailing behind which you will bring around in front which will start the spinning aspect of the hook kick. And vice versa with the other leg.








,, Some people who perform this kick make the mistake of not looking over their shoulder confidently and therefore not looking into their opponent's eyes confidently and instead looking at the ground. Don't do this! This not only makes you look stupid and timid and uncertain, it also dampens your target and aim of knockout: the opponents head. Also, there is a higher risk of falling flat on your face.








, Let's briefly go over The Hook Kick. It's self-explanatory really. The kick goes in the motion of a hook. For this, imagine a fish hook. Or the hook attached to a Pirate Captain's missing hand. There's a fs and bs Hook Kick and fs and bs with practically all other kicks, but in this WikiHow we are going over the bs kick so don't get it mistaken with the fs spinning hook kick. If you can't tell a fs spin hook between a bs spin hook then maybe this will help: If you are doing a fs spin hook kick with your right leg then you are spinning left rather than right and doing your kick from there. And vice versa with the other leg. But with the bs spin hook kick, the one we are going over in this WikiHow, you are spinning right and then doing your kick from there. So now, once again, onto the actual kick. The(stationary) bs Hook Kick. This is the one for kicking with your right leg. So, you're in stance, right leg in front, left leg in back. Same concept with your fists covering your face. Leaning most of your weight on your non-kicking(left)leg, you begin to bring up the kicking(right)leg in a sweeping, rainbow curvature like hook motion with the sharp, glimmering point ending at the right. You are using either the heel or the ball of the foot to inflict damage upon your opponents head. This may come naturally but it is recommended that when you begin the kick you turn your non-kicking, standing leg slightly more to the left so your kicking leg can have more space to make a wider and therefore more affective arch in its kick.








, So, you're turned about 180 degrees and you are looking over your shoulder, your fists clenched tightly up to your chest. From here, lift up your kicking leg and do a Hook Kick like how we went over in step 6. Since you're spinning you will have more momentum in your hook kick and may even flip your opponent over if you kick him/her in the head hard enough, with a grand sweep, almost shoving.








,, When you bring both legs back down it'll be like Step 2 again and you can get ready for another spinning hook kick but by now, s/he will surely be on the ground, wanting absolutely no more of you.

Familiarize yourself with the following key words and you'll be ready to take on the sport of fencing.,
""Lunge"" and ""Parry"": These are the two basic words which you will probably understand immediately.,
""En garde"" (French term): In training it describes the basic stance of a fencer.,
""Pret"" (French term): This is used by a judge at a fencing match.,
""Allez"" (French term): This is used by a judge at a fencing match to tell the two fencers to have at one another.,
""Arrêt"" (French term): Stop.,
""Touch"": (A much welcome replacement to stabbing, that was developed as fencing became a sport.),
""Riposte"" (Another of the ubiquitous French terms (the French love to fence), literally meaning ""answer"".),
""Disengage"" (not a French term though the French terms are so apt) : A disengage is moving the tip of a blade under an opponent's blade to the other side or where the disengage started.,
""Attack"" (we are now safely away from the French): An attack is any movement intended to score a touch.

,
""Right of way"": This is an important concept in foil fencing and in saber fencing, although it does not apply in épée fencing.,
Target areas.,
""Directeur"" (or Director): The head judge for any fencing bout.",How to Understand Basic Fencing Terminology,";
, They describe actions that occur countless times in a match at every level:


""Lunge"" is the attack and ""parry"" is the defense to the attack. You can tell the lunge because the fencer who is lunging has the point of the weapon as far toward the opponent as possible, a back leg that is straight and leaning into the attack by at least 45 degrees and a front leg that is bent to the point where the knee is over the ankle.
""Parry"" is the defender moving her weapon to ""push"" aside a blade that is attacking. There are a number of different ways to parry and lunge but the basic purpose of each remains the same.

, In a match it is a warning from the judge to both fencers to prepare to fence.

, After the judge warns the fencers with ""en garde"", the judge will then say ""pret"" to alert the fencers that the match is about to begin. American referees typically use the word ""ready"" in place of ""pret"".

, American referees typically use the word ""fence"" in place of ""allez"".

, This is used by a judge at a fencing match to tell the two fencers to halt.

, A touch is when the tip of one fencers weapon touches the target area on an opponent. Whether the touch results in a point is the determination of the director for the bout, one of whose duties it is to insure the touch was proper under competition rules. The foregoing is true in all styles of fencing. However, in saber fencing, a touch can be scored with the entire blade.

, In fencing it describes an attack that a fencer makes immediately after she executes a parry. Thus the ubiquitous fencing term ""parry-riposte"". The parry-riposte is one of the most common techniques in scoring touches you will see in a fencing match, again at any level. The parry-riposte is often done in a sequence of two or three, viz. the fencers quickly switch between attacking, defending, attacking, defending - back and forth until a touch is scored or one of the fencers backs down. At the top level of competition, the speed is dazzling to the point of being faster than the eye.

, This is done very quickly and with the absolute minimum of movement - the ""great"" fencers simply use their fingers to make the tip of the blade duck under their opponent's weapon. It is used chiefly to escape a parry or as part of a disguised attack, i.e. the attack starts toward the opponent's left side (the opponent is thinking left and prepared to defend the left) and moves to the opponent's right side (so quickly the opponent hasn't time to register the change and react to it with a parry).

,, (It is a very complicated concept but since this wikiHow is just an intro, this is a very basic explanation.) Because of the speed at which foil and sabre fencers move, there had to be some way for a judge to award a point when both fencers have scored a touch almost, if not totally, simultaneously. ""Right of way"" generally means that the attacker gets the point (aggression pays). In a ""parry-riposte"", a successful parry ends the opponent's attack and the riposte (being an attack) if successful awards the point to that fencer, even if the fencer who initiated the attack touches the parry-riposter in a legitimate target, too bad - the person executing the successful parry-riposte gets the touch. Basically, a parry transfers the right of way to the person who does it, then following up with a riposte (attack, or touch) scores the point.

, Depends on the weapon used in the match. In foil (""fleuret"" in French) fencing, the target area is defined by a jacket (a lame ) worn over the torso that appears to be of metallic material; touching anywhere else is ""off-target"" (a waste, practice point control). In épée fencing, the target area is the entire body of the opponent, including the head and feet. In saber fencing the target area is the entire upper body including the arms, torso, and head, except the hands (which are not covered by the metallic material of the lame). So, in foil a touch is off-target if it doesn't touch the lame and the fencing stops with no point scored. In épée there is no ""off-target"". In saber, even though there is a target area, no off-target occurs (stopping the action) if a fencer touches an area off-target the fencers keep fencing until a touch is scored.

, (There may be zero, two, or four ""side judges"" as well.) When the scoring lights do not make it clear which fencer scored a legitimate touch, the Director analyzes the sequence of actions between the fencers and decides which fencer gets the point, if either.

Your body should not be facing directly toward the opponent, but rather to the side. The front foot should be positioned forward, facing directly toward your opponent. The back food however, should be perpendicular to the front foot, facing in the same direction as your body.


Your two feet should be at a 90 degree angle from each other.
This position allows for maximum stability, while allowing you to lunge as far forward as possible with your front foot.Your knees should be bent far enough to extend out to your toes.
Your butt should be pushed downward as if sitting slightly.
Be sure that your front foot is facing directly in line with your blade. This is important for maintaining accuracy.Proper fencing position is uncomfortable, and will require some lower body strength, but allows for maximum mobility.If your right hand is dominant, then your right foot should be the front foot. If your left hand is dominant, then your left foot should be the front foot.;
, Your goal should always be to stay far enough from your opponent that you are just out of reach from the tip of her sword should she lunge forward as far as possible. Understanding how far this is will take a lot of practice. Maintaining this distance will also require that you be quick on your feet.


While this means that you might also be unable to lunge and hit your opponent, it leaves you in control until you are ready to advance and strike., An advance moves you slightly closer to the opponent without compromising your position. It is a three step move, during which your legs should always be shoulder length apart.


The first step is to lift your front foot, moving it slightly forward. You should end on the ball of your foot with the toes still off the ground.
Next, move your back foot forward the same distance as you moved your front foot.
As you move your back foot forward, lower the toes of the front foot so that you are no longer on the ball of your foot. Practice until this move flows like one fluid motion.

, The retreat will move you backwards approximately as far as the advance. As with the advance, the retreat allows for short, small movements that do not compromise stability.


Begin stepping back with the back foot, so that it lands on the ball of the foot.
Once on the ball of the foot, move the heel toward the floor and let the front foot slide back.

, The crossover is a larger movement, allowing you to travel a greater distance at a faster pace. When moving forward, take your back foot and move it forward in front of and past your front foot (hence crossing over). Then take your front foot and take it past the back foot so that you return to your resting position with both feet shoulder distance apart.


When moving backward, take the front foot back behind your back foot. Then, move your back foot backwards until your feet are again square with your shoulders. , A lunge is a quick, long step forward that you use to reach as far as possible with your sword. To perform a lunge, step forward with your front foot as far as you can manage, with your heel hitting the ground first. Afterward, you will need to recover quickly so as not to be vulnerable to a counterattack.


How far you lunge is dependent upon your skill level. To cover the distance between you and your opponent, you should lunge as far as possible. However, if your leg strength is not sufficient to recover from that distance and return to your normal fighting position, then you should consider making a more modest lunge.To recover, bend the back knee and pull your front leg back as quickly as possible to shoulder length distance. Following that, perform a retreat step to ensure that your opponent does not advance quickly upon you.When lunging you can straighten out your back arm, so that instead of facing up it faces backward and is straight with your shoulders. This will help you maintain your balance as you lunge., In order to excel at fencing you will need to have cardiovascular endurance, the leg strength to make long lunges, and the core strength for balance and stability. Some of this can be obtained by extensive practice with fencing, but additional exercise regimens can augment your fencing ability as well.


For endurance, consider jogging.For core strength practice sit ups, planks, crunches, and bicycles.
For leg strength, consider squats and lunges.

, Fencing footwork involves considerable coordination. You should practice the footwork to master quick, seamless, and balanced motion. You should work up the endurance to keep up a fast pace of movement for an entire match.


Nothing is natural about fencing footwork or posture. Expect it to take considerable practice to master. If you are serious about fencing, do not give up because you can’t seem to master the movements. There is no reason why you should be able to perform them initially.
Consider practicing in front of a mirror to verify that you are making the motions correctly.

, You back arm should be positioned behind your body with your bicep parallel to your shoulders and your forearm bent upward, as if in a curl position. Your front (sword) hand should be facing forward, with your elbow approximately one hand-length away from your body.You can open up the hand of your back arm so that the palm faces up toward the ceiling.Use your dominant hand to control your sword. If you are ambidextrous, consider using your left hand. Left-handed fencers have an advantage because it is difficult for their opponents to adjust to their fighting styles.

, Holding a firm grasp of the sword makes it difficult to get full wrist motion, creates over large movements, and comprises your accuracy. Use the thumb and first two fingers only to lightly secure the sword, maintaining control of it while allowing for easy flicks of the wrist.While doing this, keep your hand straight so that your sword is aligned with your arm. It is common for inexperienced fencers to bend the hand, but if your forearm is not aligned with sword, it will be more difficult to make precise and accurate movements., It is tempting to rear the sword all the way back behind your head and put all of your body weight into a slash. Although this may look impressive and would probably hurt if you were using a real sword, in fencing it just makes all your attacks obvious. To make all your motions quick and hard to anticipate, keep your arm straight and make all of your movements with your wrist., A thrust involves both your leg and arm moving forward to reach as far as possible. The leg, however, is slower and will telegraph your attack. Instead of performing both motions simultaneously, focus on moving the arm slightly before you move your leg without interrupting the seamlessness of the motion., Much of the point of good body alignment is to ensure that you can thrust the sword exactly where you need to in order to penetrate your opponent’s defenses. Ideally you can hit a dime when you thrust. Try picking a small target and practice thrust at it over and over again to see if you can consistently hit it.


If, after a lot of practice, you are still unable to thrust accurately, try verifying your form. Look in the mirror to see if you are using the correct form. Be sure that your front leg is aligned with your sword, that the sword is aligned directly with your forearm, and that you elbow is close to your body.
You should also practice twisting the sword with your wrist in a small, precise, and quick semicircle. This sort of motion is important for disengaging your sword from your opponent’s sword, freeing you to attack when you have become tangled up., Ultimately, there is no substitute for working with a partner. Understanding when to make your moves, appropriate distance from an opponent, and keeping your footwork at an opponent’s pace, can only be learned in conjunction with someone else. Find a friend who is willing to join you in your practices.

, You will typically save money by going to a professional club where you can share equipment. Purchasing equipment before you know that you can fence might be a tremendous waste of money.


Your fencing outfit might cost around $250. In contrast, a visit to a fencing club, including professional instruction, equipment rental, and the opportunity to compete against other members, will cost about $20-$50., While safe in a controlled environment with professionals, an untrained person with improper equipment could easily hurt herself when fencing. If you don't have experience and proper equipment, you should refrain from fencing at home.

, There is little sport in swinging a sword by yourself. Fencing is all about interacting with other people and interacting with people who have a variety of fighting styles.

, Skilled fencing requires precise posture. It can be difficult to observe yourself and correct mistakes in form, especially since many of these involve relatively small differences in body position. You will be most likely to improve with a professional observer giving you feedback.You can try to compensate for the absence of a mentor, by watching fencing for form. There are instructional videos online that you can watch for information about fencing form. You can also watch fencing competitions to see how professionals fence.

, Some schools, particularly high caliber universities, have fencing programs. See if your school has any fencing offerings.Alternatively, look for a fencing club. Many areas have local fencing clubs. Typically these will include an instructor who can help you master your skills and a group of people who you can compete with."

Look around you and use your own imagination, with examples like these in mind.",How to Fight With Daily Objects," Is it hard? Pointed? Long? Heavy? Flexible? Easy to conceal? All of these properties can be useful in a fight.


Most long objects can be handled like a club or staff; they can be used for slashing and stabbing, or for blocking and parrying attacks. When fighting, aim for the pressure points: back of neck, the back, the throat and in between the eyes.






Any small, hard object that you can grip firmly can be used for strike attacks. The impact of a hard object will always do more damage than that of an empty fist. Bonus for pointed objects.






Short pointed objects like pencils or ballpoint pens can be used for stabbing.






Small, heavy objects can be thrown.






Some small objects you can hold in your fist to strengthen your punch.






Flexible objects, like ropes, towels, or clothes can be used in a number of ways. For the following applications you need to grip it firmly with one hand at each end (or opposite corners for towels and the like).






Defensively, you can use it to block an attack, and ensnare the opponent's fist, foot or weapon in the process by wrapping your object around it. Use this to disarm your opponent, break his balance, or gain leverage.
Offensively, you can use it to strangle your opponent, blindfold him, or pull his feet from under him.

, It should come easily as you familiarize with your staff. Also, try to imagine yourself defending those combos. Add some moves which would make it harder to stop. A little twist here, a slight flick there could make a lot of difference.








, Try some arm exercises which would lend your arm more strength. Add power to your strikes. Exercise daily.

, More fight is in your legs than the weapon. Practice footing to add force to your blows. Move forward as you strike, and sideways as you parry. Moving backwards is almost always a disadvantage. Stay away from rotations, turning your back on your opponent, even for the fraction of a second, is not a good idea.

Observe and study The Tactical Wheel- imagine a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, but with many more components.,
Compound knowledge of fencing tactics with The Second Intention- Each of the above actions may also be executed with a specific, pre-determined follow-up action in mind.,
Understand that experienced fencers will generally try to jump around the Tactical Wheel in order to ""out-think"" their opponent, rather than trying to score touches with speed and power alone, the object being to maneuver the opponent into a position where they are vulnerable to the fencer's best actions.,
Always remember that in Foil and Saber fencing, the Tactical Wheel plays a role in determining ""priority"" or ""right-of-way"".,
In Foil and Saber fencing, it may be difficult to understand why a fencer has right-of-way when both fencers hit.",How to Understand Fencing Tactics as a Spectator," The basic tactical wheel is similar, as each tactic will defeat the one before it, and be defeated by the one following if executed properly. The pieces are as follows:Simple Attack (an attack executed as one quick action) is defeated by Parry and Riposte (defending with the blade and/or distance, and then attacking) is defeated by Compound Attack (an attack executed with multiple ""feints"" to close distance and draw out the final parry) is defeated by Counter Attack/Attack on Preparation (a timed Simple Attack into the early, non-threatening phase of the Compound Attack) is defeated by Counter Time (a feint or preparation used to draw the Counter Attack so the ATTACKER may then make Parry and Riposte) is defeated by Feint in Tempo (a compound counter attack used to evade the Counter-time) is defeated by Simple Attack (the wheel comes full-circle.).;
, For example, instead of answering Parry and Riposte with Compound Attack, a subtle fencer may make her next attack just out of distance, to allow time for a 'counter-parry and counter-riposte"". Her first action would thus be called ""Second Intention Simple Attack"". Actions can also be made in The Third (or Fourth) Intention, but discerning and employing this level of subtlety can be extremely difficult.

, Keep this in mind when watching bouts.

, The referee's decision about which fencer has priority when a touch occurs determines which fencer is awarded points, if any. Try to determine the fencers' intentions while you watch. This will help you to understand why some touches are awarded, and some are not. In Epee fencing, the first fencer to hit scores and there is no priority or right of way. When both fencers hit simultaneously (within 1/25th of a second), both score. Understanding the tactical wheel will help you to ""get inside the fencers' heads"", increasing your enjoyment of the sport.

, If either fencer asks the referee to ""reconstruct"" (the proper way, according to fencing etiquette, for a fencer to ask for an explanation), listen carefully to the words of the referee. It will often make what you missed clearer. Some referees explain regardless of such a request, but many simply award the touche (the formal name for a point in fencing) with no explanation or hand motions. Experienced referees in foil and saber will always use hand signs to reconstruct the right-of-way. Reading the motions of a referee may be difficult, so remember these basics: a finger pointed towards the ground on one side of the referee signifies the initial attack (the initial right-of-way) for the fencer on that side, an arm sticking straight out in one direction signifies the direction of an offensive action (an attack or counterattack or riposte) that landed (scored on valid target area); arms crossed in the air signify a parry made on the side of the referee on which his or her arms are crossed, and a hand held up in the air (sometimes with the arm showing attack or counterattack still extended) signifies a touch for the fencer on that side of the referee.

React with decorum to a perceived slight.,
Arrange for a neutral observer or more to aid your duelling.,
Fight a duel in a gentlemanly fashion so that on both sides honour may be satisfied.,
Try modern techniques for duelling.,
Pepper your language with well-mannered expletives during your duel.,
Be satisfied that honour has been restored.",How to Fight a Duel (the Modern Way)," A gentleman should never be drawn into a spur of the moment brawl or street fight. Perhaps you have misinterpreted a comment or simply got the wrong end of the stick? Think it over. But if the slight is too much to bear, as a modern day gentleman, you must find other means by which to resolve the anger from a simmering feud and perhaps a modern day duel is the answer for you.;
, Select a friend or group of friends not party to the feud. Have the neutral friend(s) regulate the duel and to declare the winner.

, Duelling with swords or pistols these days is neither practical nor efficacious. Instead, modern duelling calls for a makeover of the means by which the modern gentleman can settle disputes. For starters, a modern gentleman who feels slighted can demand satisfaction. Simply say ""Sir, I demand satisfaction!"" The acceptance to this should be ""Then, you shall have it Sir!"" Remember that the culture of duelling developed so that gentlemen could remain polite at all times. When demanding satisfaction, there is no reason to do so angrily or aggressively.

, The modern gentleman can adapt modern pursuits for the purpose of duelling:



Thumb war: This simple game is an excellent modern alternative to traditional duelling, as there is no bloodshed.

Both duellists curl the forefingers of their right hands, then grip each others' hand.
The duellists look each other in the eye and recite ""one, two, three, four, I declare thumb war.""
They then attempt to capture each other's thumb between their thumb and fist.
The first to hold the other's thumb for a count of three is pronounced the winner of the duel and honour is satisfied.



Talent competition: Each duellist must pick a talent of their choice and perform it to the best of their ability. The winner of this talent duel is decided by friends or bystanders offering their scores or loudest cheers.

Challenge your rival to a computer game. Follow the rules of the game to determine who is the winner.

Play a board game. Choose one that challenges their vocabulary and intellect. That should decide the matter in question.

, Phrases such as ""Have at You!"", ""Damme!"" and ""En garde, good sir!"" will add to the experience for both duellists and spectators.

, Once the duel is completed, a gentleman moves on and forgets and forgives. Resume the friendship from where it left off and be glad that both of you have an enduring sense of humour and enjoyment of one another's company.

Kick your opponent where it hurts.,
Attack your opponent's face.,
Go for the neck and throat.",How to Fight1," If there are no rules in your fight, then your only goal should be to win. If you just want to win a fight, then you don't have to follow Fighting Etiquette 101 -- just try to get your opponent to be hurt, crippled, or to fall to the ground, giving you enough time to get away. Here are some ways to do it:Knee your opponent in the groin. This is guaranteed to stop him in his tracks.
Low-kick your opponent in the groin, knee, or abdomen. Kick him using the bottom of your foot. Just make sure to do it quickly and to stay on balance -- you can easily be thrown off your game while you're kicking.;
, The face is another highly vulnerable place to attack. Hurting your opponent's eyes, nose, and face can be a great way to cause great pain and to slow down your opponent tremendously. Here are some methods to try:Headbutt your opponent's face. Use your forehead to slam your opponent across his nose. This can break his nose if you do it the right way.
Poke his eyes with your fingers. This can cause excruciating pain and can blind and disorient your opponent for enough time for you to escape or cause more damage.
Punch him in the nose. This is a highly-effective place to cause some serious damage.

, Hitting your opponent's neck and face is guaranteed to stop him cold, if only for a short period of time. If you really want to cause some harm, try these indelicate moves:Punch your opponent in the back of the neck to make him black out temporarily.

Sign up for a class.,
Prepare for the tests by adhering to belt level requirements.,
Put in the time and effort.,
Understand what a black belt means.",How to Earn a Black Belt1," Some people think it is okay to study martial arts from a book, but it is not the same. An authentic school is preferable, but the important thing is to be in a class with good teachers.There are a litany of techniques you will learn to earn a black belt in karate. You will earn your way up the belt ladder, earning different color belts as you make your way to the black belt. Your instructor will teach increasingly complicated karate moves and defense techniques you continue.It can take years of training to earn a black belt. Enrolling in a class it just the first step. You will probably start by learning the very basics of karate. You'll learn basic stances, moves, and form.
Requirements for how long you'll take classes vary, and largely depend on how quickly you can rise through the ranks. Some schools require only 2 years of training, while others require at least 4 and a half years.;
, Practice at home or in the park when you can. Keep the mindset of a martial artist.Practice every day. Ask your instructor to give you a list of moves to practice at your home. Try to practice for your own benefit. Develop a sense of autonomy by reminding yourself why a black belt matters to you. Do not practice for your instructor or to impress others. Practice for your own feeling of accomplishment.
Think about the purpose of your practice. When you're feeling discouraged, go over the reasons you wanted to get a black belt. Did you want to feel more secure in yourself? Did you want to foster a sense of accomplishment? Whatever your reason, keeping it in mind can help you feel good about yourself and drive you to practice more.
If you have friends in your karate class, considering collaborating with them to practice moves on one another. Remember to be careful. Karate is about self-defense, so you should never strive to intentionally harm an opponent.

, Winners do things that losers don't think are necessary. Depending on which discipline you choose to study, there will be a number of belts you have to acquire before reaching black. Keep in mind that age and rank play a factor in the difficulties affiliated with earning belts. The older you are and the higher you go, the more that’s expected of you.
Be patient and climb up in the ranks slowly and with purpose.

, If you want to earn a black belt, you should know what it means to obtain one. Think about the history of black belts, and the steps you'll have to take to eventually earn your black belt.To earn your black belt, you will start at the lowest ranks and earn your belts along the way. A black belt is not just a measure of strength, however. It's a reward for putting years of discipline into a craft. A black belt should mold your mind as well as your body. It should teach your patience, dedication, and independence.
You should avoid any schools that award black belts after only a short period of training. A black belt is a great honor, and gaining a black belt takes year. Make sure the school you enroll in has a standard system of testing that all students must pass to rise in the ranks.
The longer you have your black belt, the higher you'll rise. There are different degrees of black belt you can earn as you continue to study karate. If karate is important to you, strive to one day be a sensei yourself. This, however, will take years and years of training and is something you cannot do until adulthood."

Get in fighting position.,
Punch your opponent.,
Attack first.,
Adapt your strengths to the fight.,
Fight off your opponent if he's holding you from behind.,
Conserve your energy.,
Never look away from your opponent.,
Fake an attack.",How to Fight2," If you want to fight, you'll need to be in the fighting stance. To do this, just spread your legs about shoulder's width apart and bend your knees slightly so you're not standing completely upright. You need to stay balanced so you don't get thrown to the ground. Stay loose. Bounce slightly as you adjust your position by taking small steps, and keep your hands up to shield your face.


Clenching your teeth will make you less likely to get a broken jaw if you're punched.

, The first thing you have to do is make your fist the right way. To make an effective fist, fold your four fingers downward into your hand and place your thumb on the outside of your fingers -- not on the inside, unless you want to break your thumb. Punch your opponent in his nose or stomach to cause some serious damage. The simple straight punch is best for untrained fighters. Here's how you do it:


Keep your elbow bent at a 30-45 degree angle in front of your face, and keep your hands up at all times.
Extend the fist along with your elbow and shoulder, straightening your arm.
Push your weight through your shoulder and into your arm, connecting the punch at the peak of your extension to get the most force for your hit.

, Once you've gained your footing, don't hesitate. Throwing the first punch is much more likely to throw off your opponent and will give you the dominant position in the fight. Don't spend too much time stepping around your opponent or trying to get in the perfect position. Instead, punch him once you have a clear shot.

, Use the beginning of the fight to get an idea for how your opponent performs. Base your own fighting objectives on your strengths and his or her weaknesses:


If you're taller, try to keep your opponent at a distance. Your longer limbs will allow you to strike over a distance that your opponent can't cover.
If you're shorter, hurry up and get close. They'll try to keep you at a distance to use their height to their advantage.
If you're faster, get in fast, strike fast, and get out fast. Do your fighting in effective bursts.
If you're slower, keep it simple. Make the opponent come to you, as opposed to chasing them.
Know your strengths, and use them at the right time. One calculated move far outweighs a dozen uncalculated ones.

, This is a position you want to get out of as quickly as possible, before your opponent gets you on the ground and dominates you. So, here are some moves to try to incapacitate him and turn back around in the right direction:


Stomp on his instep. Land your heel as hard as you can on the instep of your opponent's foot and wait for him to yelp in pain.
Do the backwards headbutt. Fling back your skull until you hit your opponent's nose. He'll let go of you after you've done the damage.
Wring his fingers. Instead of grabbing his wrists, put your hands around all of his fingers and wring them until he gives up.

, Concentrate your energy in your moves, and don't make so many moves that you tired yourself out halfway through the fight. Some opponents will try to make you ""dance"" so that they can attack once you're exhausted. Be prepared to practice 'Aikido'. Taking a few punches whilst protecting yourself can exhaust and mentally defeat your opponent.

, Never ever look away from your opponent. Sometimes your opponent will do nothing if you look away but more experienced fighters will use that situation and may knock you out.

, Every time you attack, you become vulnerable. If you punch, for example, that arm is no longer available for defense, and the opponent might block the punch and go for your now vulnerable spot with the other hand. If you fake an attack, however, your opponent will respond with a counterattack and become vulnerable. The key is to convince the person that you will make a certain move, and to anticipate how they will respond.


You can mix fake attacks with real attacks so that the opponent becomes confused and can't predict whether you'll follow through with your moves.

Take a punch to the head.,
Take a punch to the stomach.,
Avoid getting charged and tackled.,
Avoid the chokehold.,
Know what to do if you're knocked to the ground.,
Don't let your opponent pin you to the ground.,
Yell.",How to Fight3," Though not getting punched is your best option, if you're fighting, it's likely that you will get punched at some point, so it's better to know how to avoid it. To take a punch to the head, move toward the punch, tightening your neck and clenching your jaw to minimize the impact. Aim your forehead at the punch, so your opponent ends up hurting his hand instead of hurting your nose, cheek, or jaw.Leaning in toward the punch instead of away will actually minimize the impact of the punch, because your opponent will have less time to gain momentum.

, If a punch is coming at your stomach, you should tighten your stomach muscles without sucking your stomach in. If you can, try to move around so you get hit in your sides instead of right in your stomach, which can damage your organs and cause enough pain to double you over.Avoid holding your breath or you will literally have the wind knocked out of you. Instead, try exhaling slightly before the punch, which will naturally tighten your stomach.

, If your opponent tries to tackle you, then he'll come low to the ground and will wrap his arms around your waist and hips as he tries to knock you off balance. Don't try to grab his head, though this may be tempting. Instead, move your hands forward and grip his hips or upper body, trying to push him away.After that, you've created enough distance and regained your balance, so you can try to kick your opponent in the groin or stomp on his feet.

, If your opponent is on your back and has you in a chokehold, don't try to bend your knees and toss him over your back. This will actually tighten his grip and it could cause some serious damage, especially if you're not strong enough to hold his weight. Instead, turn the choke by grabbing the opponent's arm that's around your neck, tilting to the side to create some space between the two of you until he slides sideways off your back.


If you tilt sideways enough, you may even make your opponent fall to the ground. Once you've got him down, you can try to pin him to the ground on his back.

, If your attacker has you on your back, don't turn away from him and try to get up. Looking away from him is a way to guarantee that you will be hit right away. Instead, keep looking at your attacker and raise your legs, trying to kick him as hard as you can to his shin, knee, or groin. If he's low to the ground, go for his face. Once you've caused enough damage, you can pop back up.Once you've kicked or hurt your opponent, making him spring back, roll to the side and then use your arms to support your body weight as you regain your footing.
Continue looking at your opponent, even when you try to get up. You may think he's hurt, but he can come right back at you while you're still struggling to stand.

, If you're on the ground with your opponent, you need to prevent him from mounting you, or getting on top of you at all costs. Get on your side or belly -- your chances of escape are better than if he has you pinned on your back. Once you've assumed this position, try to scramble as fast as you can to get up and away.


If he has you pinned to your back, he'll be easily able to pin you down and punch you in the face. Avoid this maneuver at all costs.

, If you want to get out of the fight as soon as possible, just yell your heart out as you're fighting. This makes it much more likely that someone will come along and scare off your opponent, thus bringing you to safety. Even if you're in a place that feels deserted, try yelling as loudly as you can anyway, in hopes that someone will come along. Yelling will also throw off your opponent because he won't expect you to yell in the middle of a fight.


Even if no one comes to your rescue, yelling can disorient your opponent and scare him into thinking someone else will come along.

Prepare to enter the guard stance.,
Raise your guards.,
Step forward with your lead foot.,
Turn and step with your lead foot.,
Look over your back shoulder.,
Lift up the knee of your non-lead leg and rotate.,
Lower your arms and bend your lead leg.,
Hop and kick with your lead leg.,
Complete the rotation, plant your kicking leg, and turn towards your opponent.",How to Do a Tornado Kick," Stand with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. Transfer your weight to the balls of your feet. Bend your knees slightly.








The guard stance is extremely versatile. It allows you to execute defensive or offensive moves without raising your opponent's suspicions.;
, Bend your elbows and raise your forearms towards your chest. Bring your hands below your chin. Keep your hands open and relaxed.







, As you step forward with your kicking foot, turn your hips away from your opponent. Continue to stand on the balls of your feet. Keep your shoulders facing forwards.








Your lead foot begins and completes the move. Your non-lead foot executes the spin kick (detailed in step 2.3).

, The first step of the tornado kick is taken with your lead foot (kicking foot). Rotate your hips so that you can step your lead foot towards your non-lead foot. Allow your shoulders to follow your hips 180° from your opponent. Plant the ball of your lead foot next to the inner arch of your non-lead foot so that your feet form a “T.”








Instead of stepping in with your lead foot, you can pivot or spin on the ball of your lead foot so that you are facing away from your opponent., In order to land the kick, you need to be able to see your opponent. Turn your head until you are able to look over your back (non-lead side) shoulder. Use your peripheral vision to spot your opponent.







, With your lead foot firmly planted on the ground, raise up the opposite knee to a 45° angle. Keep your knee raised as you pivot 90° on the ball of your lead foot. Turn out and point your knee at a 45° angle.








Continue rotating in the same direction.

, Rotate your torso and shoulders away from your elevated leg. Simultaneously lower your arms and draw them diagonally across your body. Bend, or pump your lead leg (planted leg).









This will provide your body with momentum.

, As you hop off your lead leg, begin to rotate your body towards your opponent. As you lower your non-lead leg down, drive your lead leg up in a half-crescent motion. Immediately lower the leg until the thigh is parallel to the floor. completing the other half of the crescent.








, Pivot on the ball of your non-lead foot until your back is once again towards your opponent. Plant the ball of your lead foot down on the ground next to your non-lead foot. Simultaneously step backwards with your non-lead foot, pivot on the ball of your lead foot, and rotate your body towards your opponent.








This step in the process completes both the crescent kick and the tornado kick.

Practice boxing using a heavy bag.,
Perform jump rope sprinting with a jump rope.,
Use focus mitts with a training partner.,
Use hand weights during your shadowboxing routine.,
Use a double-end bag during your boxing training.,
Use the speed bag to help improve the timing of your punches and their speed.,
Practice reflex exercises.",How to Develop Speed when Boxing," In addition to increasing the power and strength of your punches, a specific workout exists that allows you to improve your punching speed with a heavy bag.


Push the heavy bag to generate a slow swinging rhythm, then stand about an arm's length away from the heavy bag as it swings.
Move your body back and forth with the rhythm of the heavy bag, then throw straight punches at the heavy bag as it moves toward you.
Move backward slightly as the bag moves away from you, then repeat with throwing straight punches at the heavy bag as it swings back to you.
Continue to throw straight punches at the heavy bag until you become comfortable with the routine, then incorporate a variety of extra moves to your workout; such as throwing 1 and 2 punch combinations in place of straight punches, adding circling and pivots to your workout, or moving to the opposite side of the heavy bag as it swings away from you to throw more straight punches.;
, Jump rope sprinting will help develop the muscles used for fast punches; which are the fast-twitch muscle fibers located in your upper back and shoulders.


Pump your knees up and down rapidly while swiftly moving your wrists as you jump rope.
Incorporate interval training into your jump rope sprinting workout; such as alternating between sprinting in place with the jump rope for 30 seconds, then slowing your pace slightly for 10 seconds. This method may allow you to place more focus on speed during the sprinting portion of the interval.

, While using focus mitts, you can center your workout primarily around developing speed.


Throw 5 and 6 punch combinations, then follow each punch combination with a fast pivot throughout the duration of your workout.

, The hand weights will add resistance to your speed, then increase the speed of your punches after you retire the hand weights. This method will also help strengthen the muscles in your upper back and shoulders.


Shadowbox as you normally do during your boxing routines, holding 1 or 2 lb. (0.45 or 0.90 kg) weights in each hand.
Stop using the free weights after several rounds, and continue to shadowbox without the weights. You will then notice an increase in boxing speed after you have trained with the weights.

, This method will allow you to focus on hand and eye coordination in addition to developing your hand speed.


Jab the double-end bag repeatedly, then gradually work to incorporate jab and cross punch combinations into your routine.
Continue to jab and cross punch until you can eventually begin to throw 6 to 8 punch combinations at the double-end bag.

, The speed bag will also work the fast-twitch muscle fibers located in your upper back and shoulder region.


Take smaller swings at the speed bag to decrease the circumference of circles you form as you punch the bag. For example, if your punches currently cause the speed bag to form a circumference of 8 inches (20.32 cm), modify your punches so the circumference of the bag forms 6 inches (15.24 cm).

, You can develop speed by performing training techniques that allow you to move immediately from a relaxed stance into a fighting stance.


Walk at a moderate pace around your training area and focus on deep breathing to help your body relax.
Enlist a friend to shout impromptu commands every few minutes, at which point you will immediately assume a boxing stance and throw 4 or 5 punching combinations at your fastest possible speed.
Perform several rounds of this exercise during each of your boxing workouts.

Prepare prior to the situation.,
Remain calm.,
Realize.,
Knives.,
Stick or bat.,
Gun.,
If you are very close to them, and they are going for a gun on their body, simply grab their hand with yours and hold it against them.",How to Defend Against Weapon Attacks With Martial Arts," It helps to have already had some martial arts knowledge. But if you haven't, it's all the same. The only difference is practice.;
, You must develop a certain mindset. Don't think of the weapon as some God-like device that can't be taken away, or that it dramatically changes the situation. Meditate at home about all the weapons you could face before you hit the streets. What are their limitations? How could they hurt you? Once you figure this out, then you will be able to act quickly during an actual fight.

, Before you are attacked that no matter how you act, you will still get cut, stabbed, banged up, and/or shot. Do not let this deter you from staying alive. Never quit fighting until the fight is over.

, Close range weapon, very sharp, but limited to wrist movement and with only two ways of holding it. To block any swinging attack, clash your forearm with theirs hitting closer to their wrist. NEVER try to grab straight on, you could miss and still be cut. After stopping the swing, immediately slide your hand to their wrist and gain control. The closer you are to the weapon, the less strength they can use to maintain control. Hold their hand with the knife away from you so as to stay cut-free, but not so far away you lose advantage of strength. After isolating the knife, remember they may still try to hit you with their other limbs. Continue to block and hit with your free hand and legs until the knife is dropped. Kick the knife away. Never pick it up to use, you may lose it and end up at Point 1. Also, never go to the ground with a knife. You don't want to get too close because you can't tell where they will stab you.

, Same as a knife, only not sharp. Bat's have more power than sticks but are slower to swing. Sticks are fast and can be lethal, but usually only create bad bruising. With a stick, you want to get in close where their power fails. If they are swinging widely, just pick a moment where they are winding back up and move in. This will only be about a quarter of a second's time, so do it fast. Instead of blocking their arm like you would a knife, block on the actual stick, right above their hand. This area stops the whole stick with the least amount of damage to you. Again, after stopping the stick, grab it, or the attacker's hand, and move in. Proceed pummeling them. To take the stick away, leave your hand where you blocked and grabbed, move your other hand under the first and put it at the other end of the stick so both your hands are crossed, then twist the stick downward (in the direction of your other hand). Remember to throw it away once you take it. If you're up against a bat, move in close between swings and block, hitting their wrists. If you can, tuck their arms under your arm and hold them as tight as you can while you attack their face and throat. They will soon drop the bat.

, Seemingly the scariest, but it doesn't have to be. Shooting is a skill, and the way punks like to hold the gun sideways, that skill is dying fast. Also, the gun only has one dangerous point, at the very tip. Stay out of this line, and there's nothing to worry about. The hardest part is determining distance. If you are within five feet, proceed to restrain and attack just like the previous weapons, if you are farther away, run in a zig-zag fashion. If you are not so close and you have something in your hand, throw it at their face to make them hesitate shooting and move in fast or run away.

, Simultaneously, attack their face with your other hand.

Use the knees to “bob.” To perform the bobbing portion of the defense, bend your knees to lower your center of gravity.,
Learn to ""weave"" together consecutive slips.,
Combine the two movements.,
Keep moving.,
Practice stationary drills.,
Set up a rope.,
Work with a coach.,
Incorporate bobbing and weaving into your shadow boxing.,
Counter a taller opponent.,
Position yourself for counter punches.,
Dazzle your opponent with superior movement.,
Roll with the punches.",How to Bob and Weave in Boxing," At the same time, tilt your upper body forward slightly and duck your chin. When done correctly, you should be able to sink low enough for a hypothetical punch to pass clear over the top of your head. After you duck, return quickly to your fighting stance.To “bob” means to move up and down rhythmically, which is exactly how ducking is done in the sport of boxing.
Bend at the knees, not at the waist. Hunching over forces you to take your eyes off your opponent for a split second and leaves you vulnerable to uppercuts and shovel hooks from below.;
, As a straight punch comes toward you, use a tight, controlled motion of your waist, head and shoulders to lean out of the way toward the outside of the punch. This way, the punch will “slip” right past. Continue this evasive head movement to slip consecutive punches in combination. Chaining together multiple slips is known as “weaving” because of the repeated side-to-side motion of the boxer’s head.Don’t lean too far to the side when slipping punches. A proper slip is a very conservative movement. You should only lean enough to make sure that the punch passes by harmlessly.Slipping is an effective defense against straight punches because it doesn’t require you to make contact with the other fighter, and therefore suffer impact, at all.

, Now it’s time to put the “bob” and the “weave” together. Start bobbing again, using the knees and waist to fluidly drop and spring back into an upright position. This time, work in a few slips as you duck and raise up. Since punches are delivered at different heights and angles, it’s critical to learn to duck your head in conjunction with the continued lateral weaving motion of the slip in order to have a strong mobile defense.When bobbing and weaving, your head should circle forward and back, side to side while your body moves up and down. This creates a target that eludes punches in three dimensions., Be ready to bob and weave constantly as you jockey for position, move in and out of punching range or find yourself pushed back on the defensive. The idea is to never stay in the same place for long. As long as your head isn’t in the spot your opponent is aiming, they won’t be able to land a clean shot. Bobbing and weaving is so effective because it keeps your opponent guessing.Bobbing and weaving is especially effective when your opponent has you trapped in the corner or pinned against the ropes and you can’t easily move out of his range.

, Warm up or cool down by practicing bobbing and weaving. Concentrate on making each part of the movement crisp and deliberate. When you’re first getting the hang of it, the bob and the weave should be performed in sequence as two distinct motions. You can begin fine-tuning the movements as you develop a feel for the technique.Performing the bob and weave technique requires a lot of head movement. Do some light stretches before you begin practicing to keep from pulling a muscle.
Bobbing and weaving should be done fluidly and spontaneously. Try not to develop a pattern in your head movement, or your opponent may catch on. For your defense to be successful, it's essential that your opponent does not know where your head is going to be.

, One traditional approach to drilling the bob and weave makes use of a rope to approximate the center line of your opponent’s body. Simply stretch a length of rope (something as basic as a clothesline will work) from end of the room to the other at roughly chest-height. Then, work your way down the line, bobbing down and weaving underneath the rope and standing back up on the opposite side each time.Bobbing and weaving with a rope teaches you to move your head while moving forward and backward, the way you would in the ring.
Throw some quick combinations as you come up on either side of the rope. This will condition you to follow up an evasion with counter punching.

, If you receive regular instruction, ask your coach for some assistance refining your bob and weave defense. They’ll be able to critique your technique, demonstrate new training methods and work with you on the target mitts. One-on-one interaction with a coach will simulate using the technique against a live opponent and provide valuable experience.A good coach will also be able to show you how to modify your defensive posture to suit your particular style and body type.

, Add a little bobbing and weaving the next time you cool down with a shadow boxing session. Imagine that you’re sparring with an invisible opponent who has a superior reach, and that you have to continually duck and slip in and out to avoid their punches. Since shadowboxing conditions you to use various punches and defensive movements organically, it’s the perfect testing ground for trying out new techniques like the bob and weave.Face a mirror while shadow boxing and try to reflexively dodge punches as you throw them.Another benefit of shadow boxing in the mirror is that it allows you to review your form so that you can correct bad habits.

, If you’re a shorter boxer, or happen to find yourself up against an opponent who towers over you, make bobbing and weaving a key part of your game plan. The technique makes an ideal defense against taller opponents because you’ll already be in a better position to dip underneath their attacks. Making them chase you by forcing them to reach with their punches will also wear them out faster, giving you a twofold advantage.After a successful bob and weave defense against a taller opponent, initiate your counterattack while you’re still in range, before your opponent has a chance to retract their punching arm.

, One of the greatest assets of a good mobile defense is that it delivers you to safety away from your opponent’s attacks while leaving your hands free to respond with counter punches of your own. Weaving outside a jab or straight will set you up to throw a hook in return. Similarly, once you’ve ducked their punch, your opponent’s midsection will be wide open for a punishing body shot.Out-angling your opponent is all about situating yourself where they’re vulnerable to your attacks, but theirs can’t reach you. Knowing when and how to weave can help you accomplish this.If you're using a bob and weave defense to set up counter punches, make sure your movement does not telegraph your attacks. For example, twisting to put yourself in a better position to throw a counter hook after evading can signal to your opponent that a punch is coming.
Practice setting up counter punches by bobbing and weaving when you’re working out on the pads or heavy bag.

, Infuriate the competition by never holding still. You’ll get less battered than if you constantly absorb punches with your guard, and you’ll always be ready to throw a counter punch. When your opponent discovers they can’t land a shot on you, they’ll become frustrated and start making costly mistakes that you can then capitalize on.A good general rule for bobbing and weaving is that you should increase your head movement whenever you're within striking distance. However, that doesn't mean your movement should stop when when you're out of range, as it's likely that either you or your opponent will close the gap suddenly.
Keep in mind that the more you move, the faster you’ll tire out. Wait until you’re within punching range to bob and weave. It’s an excellent way to make yourself hard to hit, but it can be exhausting if you overdo it.

, Before it was a common saying, it was an effective boxing defense. Even if you can’t dodge an incoming hook or cross entirely, you can “roll” with the attack and minimize the amount of damage it does. For instance, if you see a right hooking coming and can’t get out of the way in time, bob down and weave to your right so that you’re moving in the direction of the punch and the shot glances off the top of your head.Learning to roll in the direction of a punch can be tricky, as you’ll be most likely be used to slipping punches to the outside. Be sure to train slipping in both directions and develop a sense of when an attack can be slipped and when it has to be absorbed.
By modifying your evasive maneuvers and learning how to roll, you’ll spare yourself a lot of punishment in the later rounds of the fight.

Assess your current performance.,
Set your goals


Now that you know where to start from, think about where you want to go.,
Periodised training


Despite some training programs which focus on overall conditioning with no periodization, it is better to focus on training only some competences at different stages, so you can prioritize your work and improve that area in less time.,
Train intense


Think about training in less time so you can rest more and allowing your body to recover and therefore improving faster so you can achieve your results fast.High intensity interval training has been proven to be very effective for training MMA.",How to Design a Total Conditioning Program for Mixed Martial Arts,"


If you want to design a successful training program, the first thing you must do is to know your current performance and limitations. In this way you will know where you are now and you can think about realistic results.
There are a wide variety of tests to assess your current performance. All of these tests have been proven to be a good quality indicator of your fitness level. Just calculate your score in each of them and compare to the standards to see where you are:
Cooper Test: tests your cardio resistance with this worldwide know test.
Marines physical test: test your performance with the US marine test and find out if you could qualify to be a US marine.
Navy Seals physical test: another great test to assess your performance.;
, Establish realistic objectives. Ask yourself:
How many days can I train per week?
What are the competences that I need to train most (based on your results on previous tests)?
Where do I want to be in 1 year? 6 months? 1 month?
Think first in the long term goal and then set shorter goals to see if it is realistic what you want in the long term. If you want to double the number of pull ups you are able to perform in one year, how many pull ups should you add each month?

,
How many months can you train before your next event? If you can train for one year, just establish four to six periods in it and focus on the areas you need to improve most at the beginning and focus more on competition at the end of the year.
You can establish periods of 6-8 weeks to improve your performance in strength, cardio or resistance as an example.

,
Within one short, intense workout you can train your whole body and target those competences you need to train most while still training some core competences such as cardio and resistance.

Begin slowly.,
After a couple of months of this on a daily basis your fists will be accustomed to the pressure.,
Try getting accustomed to doing wrist push ups, inverted palm.,
After months of doing this, add more repetitions: 25, 50, 100 reps a couple of times a day.

,
Begin Makiwara training.,
There are other ways to condition the body called body punishing.",How to Condition Your Hands for Martial Arts Training," Get used to forming and shaping your knuckles by doing fist push ups while standing and using a wall. Do the push up as you would on the ground. By doing them on the wall, it helps not to put too much pressure on the knuckles of the first two joints. This also helps getting the muscles used in doing push ups to get stronger and also hits the muscles at a different angle. Also do inverted palm push ups (palms facing your body) for strengthening your wrist.;
, Now you should begin doing normal push ups on the floor. A soft surface, such carpet or grass, is recommended.

, This will help in strengthening your wrist when hitting hard surfaces and also for joint manipulation techniques.

,, A Makawara is simply a 2x4 or 4x4 piece of wood wrapped with rope, either attached to a wall or fastened in or to the ground. Its sole purpose is to be struck with multiple body parts.


Weapons used: the hand, from the fingers to the wrist joint has at least nine or more striking points. There is forearm conditioning, inside and out for blocking and striking. Elbow, front and back. Shins, inside, front and outside. Knees, top, front, inside and outsides for blocking and striking and the foot, instep, side and heel. These are all ""weapons"" to be conditioned.
The conditioning of these body parts creates a condition called, ""Wolff's Law"": the principle that changes in the form and function of a bone are followed by changes in its internal structure. This means that hitting your bones on a solid object changes the pattern of the bone structure. Most bones are like a web, but by applying constant pressure to the bones, it changes the pattern from a web to a more solid structure. Kind of like when you break a bone and it's repaired, that part of the broken bone becomes stronger than the surrounding bone.

, This is a more extreme type of conditioning, but more commonly used in systems like Muay Thai.

If you are serious about this, do not go to a health club that happens to have boxing classes. You need a gym that's dedicated to boxing (and potentially other martial arts).


Odds are if you do a bit of asking around, you'll find the place that has the reputation as the best of the best in your area. There will likely be no doubt about it which club you'd like to join.;
, He will explain their hours of operation, fees and methods of training. You can also find out his experience as a boxing coach and whether he was a fighter himself at one point. Meet the staff and get a feel for the place. If it fills you with a sense of excitement and anticipation, it's probably right for you.



Do ask questions. Find out what they would recommend for you and what kind of training you should start. What's their schedule like? Who would you work with? How can you meet everyone? Make sure you know what you're getting into before you sign up.

, You want a club that has a wide range of clients at different levels. As you begin to develop your skills, you will want to start sparring with other people. A club with fighters at all different levels mean that there will always be someone for you to work with and that you can go grow with the club.


Think of it like walking into a restaurant: if there's no one there, you wouldn't eat there. And if there's only people in blue hats and you're not wearing a blue hat, you might not eat there. If there's only people who seem to be miserable, you probably wouldn't eat there. So take a look – do the clients seem A) fit and competent and B) happy with their training?
If you can, find someone who doesn't work there about the establishment. Sometimes you need an unbiased party to get an honest opinion.

, Before you start working with a coach, it's probably a good idea to know at least the 101 of boxing and some of the terminology. You don't have to be good at it, you should just know a little of what your club peers are talking about. Here's a few starters:Jab. This is the busiest punch in boxing. It's a simple punch thrown to your opponent's chin with your leading hand (the hand of the forward foot).

Cross. This punch is thrown with your dominant hand. It is a power punch. It involves a slight rotation of your torso, simulating a horizontal moment across your plane.

Uppercut. This punch ends up in your opponent's chin or solar plexus. It's thrown at close range and can be quite the cincher.

Hook. This is a short sideways punch delivered with your elbow out and to the side so your arm forms a hook.

Southpaw. This is a left-handed fighter (either naturally or converted). To a ""normal"" fighter, they do everything in reverse. Because of their stance differences, they practically fight on top of each other.

Outside and inside fighters. An outside fighter likes to keep his distance, stepping in for the jab. An inside fighter stays close, preferring moves like the uppercut.

, Your instructor will show you the basic boxing moves like jabs, uppercuts and hooks and instead of just knowing the terminology, you'll be getting good at it. You will also be given pointers in footwork, positioning and defense moves.


A good trainer will also work on your secondary skills, like endurance and agility. When he sends you running around the block, it's for good reason. And don't expect to be sparring just yet – he'll let you know when you're there.

, The number of ways a boxer can better his or her body is endless. A good program will include heavy and speed bag punching, circuit training and jumping rope. You should be training outside of the ring several times per week at a minimum.


You should be doing cardio and weight training, in addition to brushing up secondary skills with dance, yoga, interval training, and core exercises. That being said, have a day or so a week where you take it a bit easier – you don't want to wear your body out without even getting into a fight.

, These workouts should last 90 minutes and be done three to four times per week. A good boxing based workout would be 20 minutes of sit-ups and push-ups, 20 minutes on a stationary bike and then 30 minutes of jogging. The session could finish with 10 minutes of jump roping and 10 minutes of sparring with a punching bag or, if possible, another person.


A 3-mile run shouldn't really be a problem for you. Combine it with jumping rope, jumping jacks, sit-ups, push-ups, and bag work. See how long you last before you tire yourself out and your technique starts failing.

, You should be doing 20-30 minutes of dynamic stretching (rotating joints, working out any particularly stiff spots, no stretches held for a long time) before a workout and/or sparring. After any workouts spend a considerable amount of time doing some long static stretches (stretches that are held for a long time). This helps prevent injuries and reduce muscle stiffness.


You may laugh, but taking up yoga isn't a bad idea. It'll help with your muscle tone, flexibility and reach, and get your entire body loosened up and ready for anything. That's not to mention the peace of mind and focus it can grant, too., All professional boxers follow some sort of diet or nutrition program. Working out means nothing if you aren't eating well. What's more, if you eat poorly, your performance won't be top notch. Your body is your moneymaker in this situation.


What's a boxer's diet? It's high in healthy proteins – namely chicken, fish (like salmon and tuna), eggs, peanut butter and fruits and vegetables. It also includes sources of healthy fats, like olive oil, avocado, and nuts.Your body needs a balance of nutrients, fat included, to make it through all the work you're forcing it under.

, You may think this means cardiovascular endurance, and it does, but it also means two other types of endurance:Leg endurance. To be a great boxer, your legs are constantly moving. Sometimes in teeny, tiny moments, which can be even more difficult to make. After rounds and rounds of fighting, your legs will feel like cement. You can prolong your leg endurance by doing activities like jumping rope.

Shoulder endurance. When your shoulders are tired, say goodbye to your punches and your defense. You won't even be able to hold your hands in front of your face when your shoulders are down for the count. So work on that speed-bag and do arm endurance drills consistently.

, Boxing isn't just about boxing. Sure, that's the brunt of it, but you need other skills to make you well-rounded and ready for the future. Don't laugh just yet – consider a few of these ideas:Take a dance class or two. Plenty of athletes, not just boxers, take dance classes. Why? Dance is all about balance, agility, and flexibility – three very important skills in sports.
Take an acting class. You want to do promotions, commercials, and get sponsorships, right? You also don't want to look like an idiot doing them. So brush up on your skills in the spotlight to emphasize your charm.
Study business or sports management. This is good for two reasons: A) you don't want to pull a Mike Tyson and blow all your money nor do you want to be taken advantage of by people who say ""they deserve a cut"" and B) you want a future. Your body won't be able to box forever, so having a more practical but related background can help you transition into coaching or promoting.

, This can be solved by doing a quick search on the Internet or by talking to all your connections at your boxing club. When you're ready, your coach will likely let you know. You'll likely know, too.


This step is more paperwork than anything. Visit USAboxing.org (if you're based in the US, of course) to get a list of information by state. Once you do this, you'll be able to find open events that you can participate in.

, You will do this by filling out an application and undergoing a physical examination from your doctor. This is done at the state level through the State Athletic Commission when it comes to the US.You will have to contact the necessary people to get your license to compete in events. There is a minimal fee and it varies by state. Other than that, it's just a bunch of forms and a physical assessment., These events are the way most fighters get their initial experience. The fights don't count towards your record, but are the safest and most practical way of getting experience. You'll be able to find them through connections and through your organization's website, which should post upcoming events.


You'll be classed by age, weight, and record initially. You can be an amateur boxer in the US at just 8 years old!, The difference between amateur and pro boxing is that you will be allowed to wear protective headgear. This is essential in the beginning stages of your fighting career in order to prevent potentially fatal injuries while you learn to protect yourself.


Again, you will be placed according to your weight, age group and class, which will begin as ""novice"" if you're 17 or older. You'll start out in local and regional tournaments, with a long-term goal of competing in the U.S. Amateur Championships and earning a spot on the U.S. Boxing team.

, Some coaches are pretty sketchy. They'll encourage to fill a slot in a weight class just so you can get going and they can start profiting off of you. Don't do this – sometimes it's just not healthy and your body will take to injury much more easily.Only compete where you feel comfortable, not where your coach says you should go.


Think about where your weight normally stays around (provided it's consistent and you're fit, of course). You may be able to compete at about 5 pounds more or less than that, but anything greater will likely put strain on your body and be unhealthy.

, You're going to be facing really, really talented individuals. You think you're fit now, but you'd be surprised the strides your body can make, especially when it comes to endurance. At this level, here's what you should be capable of:Running 3–5 miles (4.8–8.0 km) without getting too tired
Jumping rope for 30 minutes straight
Hitting the heavy bag for 15 minutes non-stop
Being able to spar with any amateur from any gym (not including pro-level amateurs with over 100 fights)
Sparring double the required rounds (amateur boxing is 3 rounds)

, Let's cover these four things separately:



Defense. You'll be looking at anywhere from 60-150 punches per round. It doesn't matter how powerful your own punches are – you've gotta have that shoulder endurance and keep your defenses up and going at 100% at all times.

Speed. You're fighting against opponents that are the speediest you've ever fought. It doesn't matter how powerful you are – if you can't get a punch in because you're too slow, you won't be getting anywhere.

Power. This comes from good technique. Sure, throwing wild punches will catch your competition eventually, but you'll just wear yourself out. You've got to be able to concentrate your power and control it. Waste it and you've lost the match.

Autonomy. By now, you need to be on autopilot. You don't have time to be thinking, ""Okay...now I should do a left uppercut...keep your hands up, kid...oh, time to duck,"" that sort of thing. Every move needs to be a gut reaction.

, Your manager will have connections to boxing matchmakers who will set you up with fights. You will now be earning money, but keep in mind that at least 20% of your pay will go to the manager and the matchmaker. That being said, it's worth it – they're the ones working on beefing up your reputation.


By now, you're probably pretty immersed in the boxing community. You'll know which managers are in your area and which ones are legitimate. If you have talent, they'll probably want to take you on. Just make sure it's someone you get along with and can trust.

, The biggest of the biggest boxers out there drive fancy cars, rake in the millions, and maybe only fight a few times a year. Then there's a middle tier that can score some airtime on TV and can make a quick couple of thousands of dollars. But then there's everyone else. You won't be bathing in gold coins for a while, so keep your day job for now.It's kind of like Hollywood – you don't realize how many people are struggling to make it big. This is normal to start out. And keep in mind that up to 50% of your wages are going to the people below you, like your promoter or manager. Keep your income steady by having at least a part-time gig on the side.

, You will have to join a professional boxing association (IBF, WBC, WBO, or WBA) and get a boxer's license from the boxing commission you will be fighting in. There's a term for this called ""alphabet soup."" It's been coined because it seems like association after association is springing up like wildfire. If you don't like the sound of one, there's a dozen others you can consider.


In the US, again, this is done at the state level. Each state has different requirements, ranging from experience as an amateur to having a manager. At the very least, have your birth certificate and social security card at the ready – there will be plenty of paperwork.

, Your ultimate goal should be to win a championship belt. If you can hold belts in three out of the four associations, you will be classified as a ""Super Champion."" Holding all four belts makes you the ""Undisputed Champion.""


This takes time and diligence, in addition to withstanding injury and defeat. Your skin will have to be thick in more ways than one. Boxing has a way of weeding out the weak of body and the weak of mind.

, The media has a way of glorifying specific types of people. The most famous boxers are the ones that were charismatic and ate up the camera, like Jack Dempsey. But if you dig a little deeper, there's no real stereotype boxers fit into, apart from the fact that very few aren't exactly average.


Keep in mind that talent and accomplishment don't necessarily mean glory. Gene Tunney outboxed Jack Dempsey twice, but his self-contained demeanor kept him from living in the limelight, unlike his gregarious, extroverted opponent. Boxers aren't all looking for fame.Take a cue from them that boxers come from all walks of life.
Need inspiration that you can do it all? Turn to Calvin Brock, the ""boxing banker."" He was a well-educated man with a legitimate career in banking when he turned pro.If you're already in college, don't sweat it. It's doable.
On the other hand, you're never too young, either. Juan “Baby Bull” Diaz went pro at sixteen.Sure, he didn't last long, but he still did it. Now he has a law degree and is still doing well for himself. Whichever road you take, you'll likely be fine.

Set your feet shoulder width apart with heel and toe aligned.,
Put your hands up and keep your elbows tight.,
Tuck your chin to your front shoulder.",How to Develop Defense in Boxing1," You will utilize this stance for both offense and defense, which is why it is so important. This width gives you the best ability to move and the alignment will help you move easily. The foot of your non-dominant hand side should be forward.Traditional right-handed fighters should have their left foot forward. Southpaw left-handed fighters should have their right foot forward.
If your feet get too close together it will cause you to get off balance. If your feet get too wide then you will take heavy steps and will not be able to move quickly.;
, This is the most common and effective defensive technique. Your gloves should be at about eye level with your palms toward your face. Tuck your elbows close to your body, tight into your ribs.Another arm placement option is to put your non-dominant hand up around the side of your face and your dominant arm across your body between your belly button and your chest.

, It’s always important to protect your chin from getting hit because it is one of the most vulnerable spots for a knockout hit. With your front shoulder forward of your body, tuck your chin against it.You may not stay like this the whole time, but it’s an important movement to get comfortable with. You should be able to quickly tuck your chin at all times.

"
"
Assume proper fighting stance.,
Give yourself distance.",How to Disarm Your Opponent1," A knife is effective at close distances. Specifically, at punching range, clinching distance, and to a lesser degree, in a grappling situation. The non dominant foot should be firmly planted forward with the dominant foot resting on it's ball slightly behind and slightly outward. The torso should be rotated to face the opponent. Hands should be up in front of the face with elbows tucked in. Keep your fingers curled, but not in fists. This will allow you to either grasp, palm strike, elbow strike, or punch.;
, The best way to avoid a knife attack is to create distance. Thus, a low kick to the knee, groin, or stomach is a very effective way to counterattack while minimizing risk.


To counter a stomach to chest-level thrust, deflect the arm towards the opponent's line of symmetry; This will help expose his back. You can then reach over the arm and pull back while simultaneously reaching around the neck with the other arm. You must then step backwards at once to prevent your opponent from throwing you. Kick the back of the knees, step on his ankles and kick his heels to help bring him down. Alternatively, you may apply a choke hold.






A more advanced technique for the above scenario is the following; After deflecting the arm, let your hand slide down his forearm and smoothly grab his wrist. By placing a thumb on his inner writs and your four fingers on the back of his hand, bend his wrist inward while applying pressure to his triceps right above the elbow. You are now positioned behind your opponent. These actions will stiffen his arm and hyper-flex his wrist. Place his wrist right below your hip, step forward such that your foot is placed before his, and then push on his triceps while pinning his arm against your wrist. He will fall and you now have two choices. You can take his knife by holding his arm up and pushing the blade with a flat palm towards the point at which his fingers touch his palm. The safer alternative is to get on the ground and position yourself sideways with both legs over his torso such that his arm is between them and your feet are locked. Place his elbow on your femur closest to his head, near the hip, and by twisting your torso and pushing down, break his elbow.


For a low attack to the groin or legs, place your non-dominant (left if you're right handed, right if you're left-handed) elbow at an angle slightly more obtuse of 90 degrees. Use your outer forearm to block the trust. Step in and get close. At the same time, you must perform the following three actions simultaneously. Put your arm over his knife arm such that his elbow is in your armpit and clamp down to prevent him from attacking your kidneys. At the same time, throw an elbow strike at his chin with your free arm. After the strike connects, grab the crown of his head in a half clinch and pull it in. With your feel positioned parallel to each other (do not let one foot move forward as you can easily be toppled to your left or right) begin striking with your knees. Aim for the groin, bladder, and liver.






For a downward attack with the knife blade pointing downwards (also called ""Dracula stab""), block the attack in a manner similar to the low stab but (obviously) your arm will be up above your face; the procedure is very simple and very effective. When his forearm makes contact with yours, quickly grab his wrist. Then, as fast as possible, reach over his arm with your free arm such that his forearm is in the pit of your elbow. Then grab wrist. You now have a powerful lock. Step towards him and use your back and torso to crank his arm backwards at the shoulder. By taking a hard step forward you can trip him.






Warning: knife disarms do not always work sometimes no matter how good you are; there is always a risk of being stabbed. If you do, make every attempt to leave the knife in. Just because you get stabbed does not mean you are dead on the spot.

Slip a punch.,
Bob and weave.,
Perform a backward lunge.",How to Develop Defense in Boxing2," Slipping involves performing two actions simultaneously. Bend at your waist to lower your upper body. At the same time, twist your torso, bringing your back shoulder toward your front knee. Maintain your glove position during a slip so that you are ready to throw a counter-punch.Doing abdominal exercises will help build your strength to perform a slip seamlessly.

, Start the bob by bending your knees and lowering your entire body. Keep your head and chest up. Move your head in a “V” shape so your head ends up on the outside of the punch. Once your head is outside the punch, straighten your legs again.This technique does not require that you move your feet.
You should move quickly during a bob and weave. Practice it often to get the motion and speed timed perfectly.
Practice by having an opponent throw hooks at your head. Try bobbing and weaving from one direction to another in alternation, then vary the sequence so that you have to respond to your opponent's punch.

, Slide your back foot backward and bend your front knee slightly. This will effectively lower your whole body as well as create distance between you and your opponent. Keep your eyes on their chest and hands as you lunge.This is not the fastest or most effective dodge, but it is important to incorporate multiple techniques so that your opponent can’t guess your next move

"
"
Use a parry to slap a punch away.,
Catch an incoming punch.,
Perform a double arm block.",How to Develop Defense in Boxing3," As the punch comes in, lean your torso back and slap the punch away. Let your opponent’s momentum carry the punch past you. This works best when you slap the punch downward or across your body.If your opponent is throwing a left-handed punch, slap it away with your right hand. If your opponent throws a right-handed punch, slap it away with your left hand.
This is most effective when you immediately throw a punch of your own while your opponent is off balance.

, With your hand in the basic defensive position, your palms should be facing you. As you see the punch coming in, twist your wrist so that your palm faces away from you. Push your hand forward three to five inches to make contact with the punch. Step and lean back slightly to take the impact of the punch.Immediately bring your hand back into your defensive position, or use the hand you didn’t block with to throw a quick punch.

, Boxers love this technique for its simplicity. As you see the punch coming in, press sides of your forearms tight together. Raise your arms slightly so that your gloves are just below your eyebrows. Take the impact of the punch and get your arms back into standard position."
"
Hold dumbbells while you practice.,
Jump rope every day.,
Spar with an opponent and focus on defense rather than attack.",How to Develop Defense in Boxing4," One of the things that kills your defense is getting tired and dropping your hands down, which leaves you unprotected. The best way to train so that you don’t get tired as fast is to perform all of these defensive techniques while you hold light dumbbells. Your arms will build strength in the muscles that keep your hands up.You can also throw punches while you hold the dumbbells to build up strength behind your punches.

, Jumping rope is great for overall cardio conditioning and for increasing the dexterity of your feet. It helps you build good footwork and improve your speed in the ring. Switch up the jump rope exercises you do by jumping on both feet, then a few jumps on your left foot, and a few on your right foot.Push yourself to get more jumps without stopping.
You can also incorporate more complex moves like butt kickers, high knees, or skips into your jump rope routine.

, Sparring is important to implementing all of the defensive techniques you’ve learned. Don’t try to beat your opponent during sparring, but try to be effective with your defense.It’s also important to spar with as many different people as you can to get used to defending against various fighting styles.

Reduce distance!,
When you have the gun, back up quickly.,
Tap, rack, activate and aim.,
Pointing a loaded gun at a floored opponent should end the confrontation, enabling you to walk away.",How to Disarm Your Opponent2," Guns are effective at extended ranges, so it is essential to reduce distance if attacked with a firearm. Each of these techniques can be adapted for pistols and also long rifles.


If the attacker is pointing the gun at your face, it is essential to redirect the line of fire upwards to reduce the chance of collateral damage. Do so by placing the balls of your hands together and making a V with your hands. Your fingers should remain spread, however, to ensure that you can grasp the gun. Remember that your opponent is expecting some sort of reaction, so try to fuse this with a feigned raising of your arms. Grasp the barrel of the gun from underneath with the aforementioned V hand positioning. Do not grab the handle or your opponent's hands. Push up and then quickly pull down. As you pull down, step in and push your hands forward to crank the opponent's wrist back and point the gun vertically. Kick the knees or groin to disconnect your opponent. You are also in a position to twist the gun sideways. Doing so, and then quickly pulling back should force your opponent to release the gun by hyper extending the thumb.






For a gun pointed to the chest, the defense is the same as for a knife thrust to the chest. The choke hold is particularly useful here as an arm bar may be hazardous.






If the gun is aimed to the back of the head, rapidly turning into the attacker will result in his arm being next to your head. Clamp it down and finish with knee strikes to the groin, bladder, and liver, and palm strikes to the head.






If the gun is behind you, glance over your shoulder. Your opponent will be expecting this reaction. Turn and use your hips to push the arm towards the assailant's line of symmetry. Finish as in the first example.







, Create distance.

, Tap the magazine well to ensure that it is properly seated, pull back on the feeding slide to insert a fresh round and clear any jam that may have resulted from the struggle. Check the safety and aim the gun with both hands.


If the gun is a revolver, pull the hammer back into single action mode because some revolvers are single action only. Also, the trigger pull will be lessened, making a reflex shot easier.







, However, if you must fire, fire two reflexive shots to the chest with minimal effective aiming followed by a single shot to the head with careful aiming.


If you must fire while backing up, (before the tap, rack, aim) fire from the hip. Clamp the gun against your hip, being sure to lower the shoulder so that the slide doesn't hit your forearm. Stand with the gun-side foot back.

Join boxing classes.,
Practice on a punching bag.,
Hit the speed bag.,
Get in boxing stance.,
Throw a jab.,
Throw a cross.,
Throw a hook.,
Throw an uppercut.,
Throw an overhand punch.,
Throw combinations.",How to Be a Good Boxer1," Taking boxing classes can help you improve your technique by receiving expert instruction. Check online, your local newspaper, and local gyms to find classes. You can train on your own, but you will become a better boxer if you are being formally trained. Formal training will also help you meet other boxers that you can train with.;
, A heavy punching bag can be used to practice all of your punches. Exhale as you throw each punch and tighten your body and fist as you throw the punch. Always return to your fighting stance after each punch. Always protect yourself with your non-punching hand.If you are not a member of a boxing gym, you can purchase a punching bag online or at a sporting goods store.

, A speed bag will help you with rhythm, timing, hand-eye coordination, and endurance. The speed bag will go back and forth 3 times for every one time you hit it. Hit the bag with your right hand twice and then hit the bag with your left hand twice. Use the front of your fist for your first hit and the bottom of your fist for your second hit.Stand directly in front of the bag; not in your boxer's stance. You should also be eye level with the bag.
Start by practicing a single punch. Complete 3 sets of 10 punches., In the orthodox boxing stance, your left foot is in the lead. Keep your chin down with your rear hand (usually your right hand) guarding your chin. Your lead hand should be about 6 to 8 inches from your chin, and your elbows should be tucked in. Stand slightly sideways so your entire chest is not facing your opponent. Your knees should be slightly bent, and your feet should be a little wider than shoulder width.If you are left handed, you will lead with your right food instead. Your rear hand will be your left hand, and your lead hand will be your right hand. This is called the southpaw stance.

, A jab is the most important punch. It help keep your opponent away from you and sets up your other punches. A jab is a quick punch that you throw with your lead hand. Keep your chin down and protect your chin with your rear hand as you punch. Extend your arm fully and quickly and then bring your arm back to the original stance position.You should never lean in or lunge to jab your opponent. If you feel the need to do this, you are not in a good position to throw a jab.

, A cross is a punch thrown with your rear hand and is more powerful than a jab. Guard your chin with your lead hand and then fully extend your rear hand. As you throw your cross, pivot your rear foot so that your heel is up and your toes are still on the ground. Rotate your body counter clockwise as you extend your arm and lean forward just a little bit. Rotate your fist as you punch so that the palm of your hand is facing the floor. Bring your hand back to protect your chin after you throw the punch.
Remember to keep your knees bent so you do not lose your balance.

, A hook is a punch that is used to punch your opponent in the side. You can use your rear or lead hand to throw a hook. Bend your arm to a 90 degree angle and rotate your body in the direction that your punch is going. Pivot your foot as you throw the punch as well and bend your knees. Protect your chin with your opposite hand as you throw a hook.If you throw with your lead hand, pivot your lead foot. If you throw with your rear hand, pivot your rear foot.

, You will usually throw an uppercut if your opponent puts his or her head too low. This is a power punch that you throw from your waist. You can throw one with your lead or rear hand. To throw with your lead arm, dip your head to the outside of your lead foot, twist your hips, and rotate your body in an upward motion as you throw the punch. An uppercut with your rear hand usually follows a jab by your lead hand., Use your rear hand to throw an overhand punch. Arch your rear elbow to a 90-135 degree angle and lean to the outside of your lead foot. Bend your knees as you throw and aim for your opponent's head. Pivot your back foot as you throw this punch as well.This punch takes a longer time to reach your opponent than the other punches. Do not wind up too much or your opponent will know what is coming.

, Once you are able to do all five punches, practice throwing combinations. You should practice these punches until they become second nature to you. The more you practice them, the faster and more efficient you will become. You can also begin to string together multiple combinations. The basic combinations are: The 1-2 (jab -right cross)
The 1-1-2 (jab-jab-cross)
The 1-2-3 (jab-cross-left hook)
The 1-2-3-2 (jab-cross-hook-cross)
The 1-2-5-2 (jab-cross-left uppercut-cross)
The 1-6-3-2 (jab-right uppercut-left hook-right hand)

Find a training partner.,
Take a stance.,
Position yourself.,
Position your hand.,
Keep your chin down.,
Throw punches.,
Bring it on home.,
Make it your own.",How to Box in a Wheelchair,"  You can use these techniques to begin training with a heavy punching bag.  However, a training partner who is knowledgeable in boxing can help to correct your form and teach you the various combinations and techniques that make up the art of boxing.  Just be sure they have an open mind about teaching from a seated position and are willing to start off at a slow, beginner’s pace.;
, The next thing to do is to decide whether you want to fight using an orthodox stance (left hand forward, right hand back) or a southpaw stance (opposite of the orthodox).  While there are many different schools of thought on which way a boxer should position themselves according to which hand is dominant, the rule of thumb is that you want your dominant hand (usually the hand you write with) to be your rear hand, or power hand, and your opposite hand to be forward, otherwise known as your jab hand.  For simplicity, this article will describe the following steps form an orthodox position.  If you are choosing southpaw, simply do the opposite of what is described.

, Position yourself at an angle in front of your training partner and lock your wheels.  You want your front-left wheel to be slightly closer to your partner than the front-right wheel.  Ideally, your body should be positioned slightly sideways, with your left hand forward and your right hand slightly farther away from your partner.  You’ll know you have the right distance when you reach forward with your right hand and you can comfortably touch your training partner’s face and if you can reach them with the right hand, you can certainly reach them with the left.

, This is another area in boxing which is open for debate.  Sticking with textbook style boxing, you want to hold your hands, palms turned inward towards your face, up to about cheekbone level.  Your hands should be far enough apart that your thumbs can just barely touch your ears, yet your elbows are close enough together that when your arms start to get tired you can comfortably rest your elbows on your chest and keep your hands up with minimal effort.

, Whenever you are training, it is good practice to look at your trainer’s/opponent’s chest.  First, this help you keep your chin down which protects your jaw from being hit (which helps keep you from getting knocked out). Second, this takes any sort of staring contest you may be tempted to have with your opponent completely out of the picture (your opponent’s eyes are deceiving and he can use them to trick you, don’t let him).  Third, you can see incoming punches better when you look at the chest.  You will see your opponent’s shoulders start to move out of your peripheral vision before the punch comes out.

, Standing boxers generate power by using their feet to shift their body weight and to rotate their hips into a punch (kind of like swinging a baseball bat or a golf club).  Obviously, the feet have been taken out of the equation but you can still generate power by rotating your upper body, namely your shoulders.  No matter what punch you are throwing, pick either your left or right shoulder and focus on moving it while you throw the punch. Let’s say you’re focusing on your left shoulder.  When you throw a jab with your left hand, think about pushing your left shoulder forward behind the punch.  When you are throwing a right cross, think about pulling your left shoulder back, which will cause you to push your right shoulder forward without you actually thinking about your right shoulder.  Lean forward into the punch (if you can) but do not over-extend as you could get off-balance and fall out of your chair.

, Say you are throwing a right cross to your opponent’s face.  Do not think about hitting your opponent’s face.  Think about hitting through their face.  Mike Tyson once said that he imagined all of his punches hitting through his opponent’s face and coming out the back of their head.  This sounds gruesome but by punching through the target you generate more power.  After you have made contact, focus on pulling your hand right back to your face just as quickly as you threw it out.  This makes sure that you are back on the defensive as soon as possible and ready for any punch your opponent may throw in response.  Also, by recoiling quickly you put a “snap” on the punch which sends more explosive power into your opponent than a dull “thudding” punch does.

,  Boxing is an art and art is about self-expression.  Watch other boxers and other wheelchair athletes and think about ways you can adapt their techniques to use in your own chair.  And most importantly, have fun!

Practice getting hit.,
Move your head.,
Spar with another boxer.,
Interrupt your opponent's punches.,
Shadow box to practice your skills.",How to Be a Good Boxer2," Getting hit during a fight will take a lot of energy out of you and cause you to become fatigued. When you get tired, it will be harder to keep your hands up. To prepare your body for this, train with 3 or 5 pound weights around your arms and ankles.To prepare for body shots, have someone drop a medicine ball on your stomach while you are doing crunches. The ball should drop in between each repetition., In addition to protecting your head with your fists, you must learn to move your head to avoid getting hit. A good way to move is to practice making letters with your head. Try the following letters:""T"" - move your head side-to-side and then duck down
""V"" - move your head down and then slip
""C"" - move your head backwards and then around

, Sparring is a time for you to have a practice your skills and test your conditioning. Punching bags are fine, but they cannot prepare you to box with an opponent in the ring. Spar with people who are a different size than you and that have different abilities (e.g. faster, more advanced, better jab, slower than you, etc.) Remember that sparring is about practicing and getting better, not beating up your partner., When your opponent throws a punch, your first instinct will be to protect yourself. However, you do not have to wait for your opponent to finish throwing punches before you start punching back. Counter your opponent's punches instead of focusing on blocking.Always keep your eyes on your opponent as you take a punch and try not to lean back.

, Shadow boxing allows to you to visualize different opponents and scenarios.Practice throwing punches, moving your head, and moving your feet. Practice different combinations. Focus on your technique and quickness as you throw your punches as well.Do not wear gloves or use weights when you shadow box.
It is helpful to shadow box in front of a mirror or in front of a trainer so that you can get feedback on your movements.
You can shadow box for an allotted time period. Try focusing on a specific skill (e.g. uppercut, pivoting your foot) during each round.

Jump rope to improve your footwork.,
Jog to increase your endurance.,
Be flexible to improve your performance.,
Lift weights to increase strength.,
Do interval running.",How to Be a Good Boxer3," Jump roping develops your endurance, coordination, agility, quickness, and footwork. Use small wrist rotations instead of your entire arm to swing the rope around. Jump high enough so the rope slides right under your feet. You do not want to jump too high. Your landing is one of the most important parts of your jump roping. Stay on the balls of your feet and keep your knees slightly bent as you land.Once you can have mastered basic jump roping, you can try more advanced techniques like jump roping side-to-side and crossing your arms.
Get a jump rope that is long enough for your body. You should be able to step in the middle of the rope and pull the handles to your shoulder.
Start by jumping rope for 20 seconds without tripping. Build up your endurance until you can jump rope for 1, 2, or 3 minutes (rounds) without stopping. Take a 30-60 second break between each round., Jogging will build your endurance so that you can last through 12 rounds of boxing. Run at an easy pace where your heart rate does not go higher than 150 beats per minute. Try to run for at least 60 minutes, 5 times a week.If you are unable to run for 60 minutes without stopping, run for shorter periods of time and work your way up. If you have not been jogging regularly, work your way up to 5 times a week as well.


If you are a beginner, start with running for 10 or 20 minutes, 3 times a week.
You eventually want to build up to running for 2-3 hours, 5 times a week., Stretching before and after your workouts will improve flexibility, lower your risk of injuries,and increase your range of motion.Stretch all of the major muscle groups in your body (e.g. legs, arms, chest, shoulders, back, abdominal). Hold each stretch for 30 seconds. Try to stretch for at least 15 minutes every time you stretch.Never stretch cold muscles. You can stretch after you warm up (e.g. jump rope or light jog) or after your workout.Focus your stretching on areas that you use the most when you are boxing.These include your chest, hip flexors, calves, biceps, and abdominals.

, Weight lifting can improve your power and speed. Olympic style weightlifting is particularly helpful in your boxing training. Back squats, clean and jerks, dead lifts, and snatches are all great exercises. Lifting should not be done on the same days that you are doing your boxing training. For example, if you are in the boxing ring Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then you would lift weights on Tuesday and Thursday.If you do not want to do Olympic style weightlifting, you can do more traditional exercises. Do exercises for your hips and legs (e.g. lunges, squats, mountain climbers), core (e.g. planks, back extension, etc.), and upper body (e.g. pull ups, push ups, chest press, shoulder press, etc.)Avoid strength training the week before your boxing match.

, Boxing requires a lot of stopping and starting. Interval training mimics the stopping and starting that your body will go through during a boxing match. Run for 200, 400, 600, or 800 meters as fast as you can, and then rest for 1 minute between each interval.Do interval running 2 or 3 days a week and never on consecutive days.


For example, do intervals on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday instead of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
Adjust the amount of intervals you are doing based on the length of your fight. If you are training for a 5 round fight, run 6 intervals to prepare.

, One of the most important aspects of being a good boxer is having an efficient cardiovascular system. Boxing is one of the most physically demanding sports and requires a lot of endurance to fight multiple rounds. Conventional boxing exercises include running, jumping rope, hitting the heavy bag, shadow boxing, sparring, or doing circuit exercises and light weight lifting.Before sparring or doing any technique training, you should do a cardio work out for at least 30 minutes to an hour each day.


If you are out of shape, you may need to concentrate more on your stamina than the average person.
Don't let bad cardio stand in the way of your boxing dreams. Joining a gym will help you improve cardio drastically if you stay committed.

, Technique in boxing is far more valuable than brute strength. Speed plus technique equals power, so bodybuilding or having big muscles with no practical strength will not help you. In boxing, you must learn how to stand correctly and how to throw a variety of punches.


The standard boxing stance has your back leg slightly bent with your weight on it and your toe at an angle. Your non-dominant foot should be pointed forward. Both hands should cover your chin and face.
You will need to master all the basic punching techniques which include jabs, straights, uppercuts, and hooks., A trainer can show you how to move forward, back, and side to side while staying guarded, as well as how to block and slip punches. It's important to have good chemistry with the trainer you are working with. Make sure to communicate with them and tell them what your goals are.


If you are a little more experienced with boxing, let your trainer know that you know the basic form and technique, so you don't waste time.
Always listen to what your trainer has to say. Trainers can see things from a more objective view and will help you improve your skills.

, The speed bag helps a boxer with timing and accuracy. Use one hand and punch the speed bag slowly at first. See how the bag acts when it bounces off the backboard and try to hit it when it is swinging back. Once you manage to control it, increase your pace and start using both of your hands.Mastering the speed bag is not easy and will likely require hours of practice before you can get the correct rhythm.

, The heavy bag helps a fighter work on his technique and power. Remember always to wrap your hands and wear gloves before practicing on the heavy bag. Start by throwing light jabs, straights, and hooks to the heavy bag. Your punches should be quick and crisp. Also remember that a punch's full range of motion includes bringing your hand back to protect your face.


A common misconception is that the heavy bag should sway back and forth. This indicates ""pushing"" punches, which don't utilize proper technique.
Even though a heavy bag can't hit back, it's essential you maintain good form while using it so you don't hurt yourself.

, Boxing is one of the most grueling sports to train in and requires dedication and pushing yourself past your limits. In boxing you'll need to build up an incredible amount of stamina, toughness, power, and speed to defeat your opponents in the ring.If you are a competing boxer, you should workout five days a week for three to five hours to stay in fighting shape.If you feel like giving up, push yourself to keep going. You will not see improvement until you push yourself past what you thought you couldn't accomplish.

, Once you have the basics down, and your cardio and stamina are good enough, you should begin sparring with other people that train at your gym. Talk to your trainer to see if you're ready, then choose a sparring partner with a similar skill level. Sparring will show you to how it feels to deliver and receive punches in the ring.


Do not try to hurt your sparring partner. The aim is not to win, but improve both of your skills and get practical experience in the ring.If you have to spar with a more experienced fighter, they will likely go easy on you. You should do the same if you are sparring someone with less experience.

Punch through.",How to Jab in Boxing," We'll use the left jab throughout this article -- for the right jab, everything is reversed. So for now, place your left foot in front of your right, right angled out a bit, pointing toward your opponent. Put your hands up to protect your chin, tuck your elbows in, chin down, and make sure your hips are above your feet.









It's important that you keep your body and hands relaxed. Have a slight bend at your knees and bring up your back heel just a bit. Bounce around, getting comfortable in the stance. Make sure your feet are around shoulder width apart and your front foot is pointing mostly forward and your back foot is pointing mostly out.
Whatever foot is forward is the hand you're jabbing with. The jab is a punch that comes straight out, being closer to your opponent than the cross.;
, Your right is protecting your chin, playing defense, while your left is up, waiting to strike. If you are taller than your opponent and it is unlikely that he will pull off a straight right to your face, you can keep it low for greater power and visibility. Otherwise, keep it at your chin ready to parry or block.









You're in the optimum position right now for your jab. Now while the jab comes from your core and not your arm, it is important not to launch yourself with the jab. You won't get a better punch for it. You should feel a slight, natural rotation, but that's it.

, Simultaneously shift off your back (right) foot (but don't let it come off the ground) and put your weight onto your left, while throwing your left arm into a quick, powerful jab. Twitch your entire left side forward while ever so slightly lifting the heel of your left foot. As your hand comes forward, your body's weight should come forward at the same time.









Keep your chin tucked in behind your shoulder. In fact, your shoulder should come to meet your chin, offering it even more protection than in your normal stance.
Throw the jab straight out as if you're punching into a pipe. Keep your elbows in and aligned with your fist and the rest of your body. No part of you should needlessly stick out -- or you're asking for an easy hit.

, When your hands are held at your chin, your thumbs are facing you. But when you go to jab, rotate your hands so that your palms are facing down, thumbs slightly lower than perfectly horizontal. Think of it like a slight corkscrew motion. It's in that twist that there's power -- kind of like the cracking of a whip.









Your rear hand is staying near your chin this entire time. It is there to protect you.

, ""Quickly"" being the keyword here. You can either bring your back foot forward, encroaching on your opponent's space, or step back, putting the weight again on your back foot. But don't step back as you throw the jab, or it won't have any power.









Tighten up your fist only upon impact. If you do it beforehand, you lose speed and power. It also wastes energy. And right after impact, relax again. Resume your boxing stance or get ready for your next move.

, If you are tall, your objective is to get in close enough to deliver a straight right cross. If you are smaller and more compact, you may need a few jabs to get in close enough for a hook or uppercut. The jab will help you accomplish both of these.









Even though it's not the strongest punch, it's the most useful. It's both defensive and offensive and is like a small spark of power with supremely accurate precision. It can interrupt combinations, gauge distances, and set you up for the knockout. It can also be very, very distracting. Experiment with yours in different circumstances.

, This is really just a diversion. It distracts your opponent, forces him to go on the defensive, and gives you a second to set up another attack. You don't put much energy into the tapper jab -- hence its name. You just give your opponent a light tap while you rev up with your right.









In this situation, it's common to tap your opponent's glove with your left and then throw a kick cross to his face or uppercut to his body. The tapper jab is the setup to a lengthier combo.

, Since your opponent knows what a jab is usually used for, you can totally psych him out with a double jab. He's expecting you to jab with your left and then throw big with your right -- but no, no, no. With a double jab, you hit him left, left, and he won't know what hit him. Literally.









A double jab can also break up the chaos when you and your partner are both caught in 1-2 combinations. You both jab with your left and when he goes for his right, your left blocks it and you get the point, even if it's a hook. And you can do the double moving forward, to the side, or backwards, too.

, You could just jab your opponent in the face, but why stop there? Experiment with jabs high, medium and low. High to the face, medium to the body, and low -- where you're bending low at the knees, avoiding punches and attacking your opponent at his core. The principals all remain the same.








, When your opponent throws his right at your face, you block it with your right and, since his is left unprotected, you throw a quick jab with your left and boom. Point. It sounds simple, but you have to make sure you're swift and yet relaxed. You have to counter as quickly as possible. No time to flinch!









You've got to think on your feet with this one; if you're planning your counter or get tense with expectation, you'll slow down, lose energy, and your opponent will be able to read you. Stay in the moment, keep your head back in case he follows with his right, and step back if need be.

, If you get a jab in and then step back, your opponent is probably throwing his right and missing. And then, like a fox, you get back in there and throw another jab -- something he probably won't be expecting. Agility and speed is important here, too. Make sure he can't read you and follow it up with a hard shot when he's vulnerable.








, If there's one thing you know about boxing, it's probably that you want to take as few hits as possible. So when it comes to jabbing, it's absolutely imperative that you keep your elbows in when you punch. Your opponent can easily see from side to side -- it's the up and down that's harder to spot. If your elbows are flailing at your sides, you'll be asking for it.









Only thing on the up-down plane. There is no left and right when it comes to your elbows. When you think of the punch as coming from your body and not your fist, this is easier to maneuver.

, Yes, a punch comes from your legs, hips, and core. If you just ""push"" out your punch, there won't be any power behind it. But at the same time, you are, by no means, launching your weight forward. The bag might show that you have force, but any real life opponent will be able to quickly get an attack in when you're all off balance and tense.









Weight does not equal power. Plenty of muscly guys get to the gym and tense up their muscles and think that's how it's done -- and then they run out of gas and have no defensive game. Those small, spindly boxers have gusto for a reason.
Think of a steel rod running through the backside of your body. It'll keep you from compromising form and technique.

, Most of your power comes from the transfer of weight and the movement upward through your core. You put your weight forward, it moves up your body, and out through your arm. If you're just punching with your arm, you're making minimal impact.









The only thing that is in your arm -- your hand, actually -- is the final snap, like that whip cracking. An upwards snap should be felt through your knuckles, sealing the deal.

, If you're remaining relaxed up until the point of impact and rotating your arm, palms down, shoulder toward your chin, you should have a natural sense of power. Use that sense to punch through whatever it is you're up against. Not at, not on, through. Your energy and force does not stop once you hit your opponent -- you need to feel that energy to whip your arm right back into place for the next point.

Commit to a rigorous, comprehensive training regimen.,
Learn boxing fundamentals.,
Practice punching.,
Learn to take and block punches.",How to Box," Some boxing experts suggest that beginners train for 3 to 6 months before ever entering a ring. This allows fledgling fighters to reach peak physical condition and perfect basic techniques before suffering their first blow. Most physical-conditioning programs for boxers can be broken down into 3 categories: cardiovascular, core exercises and weight training.



Cardiovascular exercises: Fatigued fighters tend to drop their gloves and leave their heads exposed. They also can't produce the energy to effectively counter punch in late rounds of a bout. That is why top professional fighters jog hundreds of miles of roadwork. Boxers need to not only have extreme endurance capabilities, but also summon short bursts of power at key moments in a bout. To meet these physical requirements, boxers will vary their roadwork programs. For example, boxers will vary the pace of their endurance-building runs to include brief, all-out sprints. This simulates the physical demands of fighting.







Core exercises: Boxers generate much of their power from the core of the body. By performing exercises that involve many muscle groups, a prizefighter can build a powerful core that forces all parts of the body to work cohesively. Some of the most effective exercises include chin-ups and pull-ups, crunches, squats and thrusts. Do 3 sets of each with 1-minute breaks in between exercises. Chin-ups and pull-ups should be done until you can't do any more. Do 20 reps of the other exercises.







Weight training: Weightlifting helps new boxers build strength and punching power. The chest, shoulders and arms are of particular importance. Upper-chest exercises include the flat bench press and dumbbell flies. Shoulder muscles can be targeted with dumbbell military presses and lateral raises. Biceps curls and triceps kickbacks help build upper arm strength needed to increase punching power. The key in weight training for boxers is to develop explosiveness. This means doing 6 to 8 reps of each exercise with the heaviest weight you can handle. Do 3 sets of each and vary the exercises so your muscles don't plateau. Alternate days between core and weight training.





;
,


Stance: A strong, comfortable stance will enable you unleash powerful punches and swiftly evade blows from your opponent. If you're a right-handed fighter, the proper stance is to have your left foot in front of you, at a 45-degree angle from your opponent. Your left heel should line up with your right toe. Most of your weight should be on your back foot. Keep your elbows in and your hands up, with your left under your cheek and your right under your chin. Keep your chin down at all times.






Footwork: Keep on your toes and keep moving. Never provide a stationary target. If you're facing a right-handed rival, move to your right. If you're facing a lefty, move to your left. This keeps a greater distance between you and your opponent's strong hand. Never cross-step. This can put you in an unbalanced, indefensible position.







, Successful boxers practice punching techniques long before they ever enter the ring. Whether shadow-boxing or using the heavy bag, new boxers must concentrate on using proper form when unleashing a blow. After they become adept at delivering a variety of punches, fighters usually develop combinations, in which they release a devastating flurry of blows on their opponent. Some of the most effective punches in boxing include:



Jab: Usually done with the weaker, front hand, the jab helps keep your opponent away from you. The jab is a short punch. To maximize the effectiveness of the jab, professional boxers twist their arm and wrist just before making contact with their opponent.






Cross: As opposed to a jab, which is thrown straight in front of the body, this punching technique is delivered by the strong hand in a slightly upward motion across the body. The shoulder helps power the cross.







Hook: The hook can be delivered to the head or body of the opponent – whichever is unprotected. It is often used in combination with other punches. The sweeping delivery is its chief drawback, as it can leave you susceptible to a counterpunch.







Uppercut: This is an upward blow unleashed by either hand that is highly effective when in close quarters.






Combinations: After you have mastered punching methods, you can work on combinations. The first combination most boxers learn is the old 1, 2 (a jab followed by a cross). Another effective combo adds a hook to the 1, 2. (If you're right-handed, this would be a left jab followed by a right cross and ending with a left hook.)







, Boxing isn't all about throwing punches; minimizing your opponent's blows is a vital part of the game too. Some of the standard evasive maneuvers in boxing include:


Parry: After keeping your gloves up and chin down, the parry is probably the most basic defensive technique in boxing. To parry, you simply use your hands to slap your opponent's punches down as they arrive.







Slip: The slip is performed by sharply rotating your hips and shoulders as your rival throws a punch aimed at your head.







Block: When blocking a punch, you make no effort to avoid contact. You're just absorbing impact with your gloves rather than your body.







Bob and weave: The bob is executed by bending the legs to avoid a high blow, like a hook to the head. The weave often follows. It is executed by arching the body just out of range of your opponent's extended glove.






Rolling: This is a technique often used by former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. Press your gloves to your forehead, hold your elbows in against your body, and keep your chin against your chest. This provides little protection against side-body blows but is an effective defense against a barrage, as most of the impact is absorbed by your gloves and forearms.

Don't exert all your energy in the first couple rounds.,
Look for holes during the first couple rounds.,
Tire your opponent out.,
Don't stay on the ropes undefended.,
Keep your hands up.,
Listen to your corner.,
Determine your style.",How to Be a Boxer2," Maintaining your endurance during a boxing match can be harder than other sports, because of psychological factors that may make you more nervous and interrupt your breathing.Pace yourself in the fight and don't make unnecessary movements or punches if you know they are not going to help you win.


The first round should be a feeling out round. Use defense and evaluate your opponent's technique.

, Find weaknesses in the opponents defense that you can exploit as the match progresses, instead of punching wildly and becoming tired. Take note of the bad habits or tendencies that they have as a fighter. For instance, if they always lower one hand when they throw a straight, this is an opportunity to counter with a hook.


If they put their hands down when they are disengaging, this is a good opportunity to move in and land some solid face punches.
If they don't protect their body, land body shots early in the fight, so you tire them out as the match progresses.

, If you can defend properly and your opponent punches wildly, you can make them tired and take advantage of his lack of endurance during the later rounds. If your opponent is a power puncher and is looking to land one good shot, make sure to stay mobile and always keep your hands up.


Explosive punchers become tired more quickly because of the energy that they spend on each strike., Do not stay immobile and defensive on the ropes, or the referee may stop the fight early. Even when you are blocking, it's up the ref to make the final decision on whether the fight should continue. Also, being on the ropes limits your mobility and reduces your options if you need to move back., During the later rounds, you may become tired, and your hands will most likely start to fall, leaving your face and head exposed. This is the perfect opportunity for an opponent to take advantage of a hole in your defense and knock you out. Always keep your hands up unless you are defending body shots.


A boxer with a lot of power can punch through your block and cause damage even if you have your hands up. In this case, use lateral movement to stay away from his strikes.
Use a combination of head movement and blocking to defend strikes and tire out your opponent., Your corner will be able to see the fight from a different angle and can tell you where you need to improve and how and why you are winning or losing the fight.Make sure to listen to them between rounds and try to make adjustments as the fight progresses.


It's easy to develop tunnel vision during a fight and block out any noise or advice, but this will only work against you.

, Once you've learned the fundamentals and have spent time competing, you'll most likely have a style of your own. While the basic building blocks must always be there, people are proficient in different things. Leverage whatever your best assets are and use them in your boxing strategy.


If you are a powerful puncher, work on your blocking technique and opening up your opponent's defense by landing body shots.
If you have really good stamina, try wearing down your opponent and taking the fight into the later rounds.
If you are quick, work on counter punching , movement, and slipping your opponents punches.

Go to a doctor before you start boxing.,
Don't fight without proper training.,
Keep your hands wrapped when punching.,
Always wear protective gear when sparring.,
Never start fights.,
Respect and listen to your instructor.",How to Be a Boxer3," Certain medical conditions could prevent you from boxing. Make sure to consult a physician before you start training. If you are prone to seizures or have a neurological problem, you should not spar. Talk to your doctor to see what they recommend.


For some conditions you'll be able to train, but will be advised against fighting.
If you have heart disease, asthma, diabetes, cancer, or lung disease, consult a doctor before starting a new workout routine., Learning how to fight without the proper training can be a detriment. You could be utilizing poor technique during practice and reinforcing bad habits which may be hard to unlearn down the road. You also could be practicing in an unsafe environment and could hurt yourself or your training partner. When starting off, go to a certified gym with trainers who have experience.

, Your hands are the most valuable tool for boxing and must be preserved for you to compete. Many amateurs will put on boxing gloves without wrapping their hands first. This could cause serious injuries in your hand, knuckles, or wrists that could end your boxing career. Wrapping your hands will prevent injury and reduce swelling and pain after punching., Always take precautions or someone could get seriously injured. Wear a mouthguard, headgear, and a cup so that you protect yourself during practice.


Sparring without a mouthguard could result in a cut lip, cut tongue, or a broken tooth.
Even light punches could cause serious injury if protective gear is not worn.

, Your experience as a boxer also comes with a new responsibility to keep a calm and cool head when outside of the gym. Taking your skills to the street and provoking fights could get yourself or someone else seriously injured or could even be fatal.Because you're the one with the training, you could face serious penalties or jail time. Avoid fights at all costs and try to resolve your problems with words.


In dire circumstances use your skills for self-defense.
To avoid a fight you could say something like, ""I'm a trained fighter and I do not want to fight you. Please leave me alone.""

, Your instructor will know how to train you safely and properly. Even if you have experience competing, always remain respectful towards your instructor. They may see something that you can improve on. Ultimately they are the expert, and you are the student so you must follow their directions to improve.

The moment you realise that the opponent is serious about doing damage to you, put yourself in a position where your vital points (see step three/tips) are offline, meaning that they are not easy targets for your opponent.,
Examine your opponent's vital points.,
Get yourself in a low stance, one that is not easily shifted by your opponent.,
Attack whatever you can logically get at.,
Remember the axiom ""the best defense is a good offense."",
Dynamically respond to what your opponent does.,
Manipulate your opponent's body weight.,
Your surroundings contain surfaces much harder than anything on your body.",How to Efficiently End a Fight,";
, Vital points are places around your body that are not naturally protected by muscle, making them the best places to aim for. Vital points run through your center line- which runs from top to bottom of your body. See ""Tips"" for more.

, This gives you a good, solid base to launch effective attacks from.

, If it means that your opponent isn't going to recover in order to keep yourself safe, then by all means do it.

, If you have made every attempt to avoid the confrontation, you can reasonably assume that any sudden movement on the part of your opponent is the start of an attack. The moment he initiates his attack, attack him. In all likelihood, he has initiated with the thought that he will simply drop you. So when you beat him to the punch (literally), he will be caught by surprise, and give you an opening to catch him with a follow through.

, Say your opponent throws a right punch at your face and you block/dodge it, think about what is easy to get at, in this case, assuming you blocked with your left hand, his/her stomach, solar plexus, throat, groin and eyes will all be open to you. All you need is one scoring shot and he/she's going down.

, If your opponent is punching you, that would usually mean that he/she is lunging forward. Grab their arm with one hand and pull them into your attacking free hand.

, If you are able to smash your opponent against a wall, tree, rail, or the ground, and you must do so to end the fight, then there's another option. Try to remember, though, that self-defense only goes so far.

Choose a variety of wrap.,
Place your wrap right side up on a table to get proper alignment with your wrist.,
Bring the wrap around behind your wrist three times.,
Bring the wrap down across your palm and wrap it 3 times around your palm.,
Turn your hand over and loop the wrap diagonally across your palm toward the floor.,
Start wrapping between your fingers.,
Turn your palm toward you.,
Go around your knuckles three more times.,
Secure the velcro onto your wrist.,
Use the proper pressure when wrapping your hands.",How to Apply Boxing Wraps1," The two basic varieties of wraps are available in junior (120"") and adult sizes (180"") to accommodate the size of your hands. Wraps are used to keep your fist tight and secure your movable knuckle-joints while you box. They're not used for cushioning the impact of blows, which is the purpose of the glove.


Traditional cotton wraps feature velcro to secure the wrap to your wrist and a thumb hole to keep the wrap tight as you fight. They're long-lasting, durable, and easy to secure.
The Mexican wrap is similar in design, but features elastic to help grip the hand more easily. These tend to get worn out over time, but offer the benefit of contouring to the shape of your hand.
Consider the quick-wrap alternative. Also called ""quick wraps"" or ""gel wraps"" or ""glove wraps,"" these easy-on alternatives are basically just fingerless gloves with some padding that some boxers will use in place of wraps. They're easy to take on and off, though might be more difficult and less customizable to fit your particular hand. The safest method of wrapping is using a more traditional wrap and learning to do it yourself.;
, One end of the wrap has a thumb hole. Put your thumb through the thumb hole, keeping your fingers spread so you don't wrap them too tightly.









It's important to secure the thumb hole on your thumb in the correct orientation. You want to wrap toward the back of your hand, to keep the thumb secure in the hole, not toward the palm of your hand. When you wrap toward your palm and make a fist, the loop will slip off.

, The wrap should rest on the inside of your wrist after you've completed three circles with the wrap. Loop the wrap up across the back of your hand at an angle and bring it back toward the floor.








, Remember to keep your fingers spread slightly apart and don't worry so much about getting it on your knuckles. Wrap it comfortably around the palm of your hand.









It's important to keep your wrist straight as you're wrapping. Keeping it flexed is dangerous and will keep you from being able to make a straight strike when you're boxing., Stop with your hand pointing up and your palm still facing away from you, as if you were telling traffic to stop.








, Loop the wrap diagonally across the back of your hand and run it between your pinkie finger and ring finger, then bring the wrap diagonally across your palm toward you, and wrap it around your wrist and bring it back under your thumb to complete the next pass.









Continue this pattern between your ring and middle finger, between your middle and index finger, and then once around your thumb, always wrapping back around your wrist once between knuckle passes.

, Now that you've wrapped around your thumb once, flip your hand back over so your palm is facing you. Go behind the thumb and across your palm with the wrap. This is an important step to secure your thumb without choking it and keep the wrap secure on your hand while you box.








, At this point, you may be almost out of wrap if you've got very big hands, or you may have a lot left you need to run out. If you need to run out the rest of the wrap, point your palm away from you and do X's around your palm and wrist.








, If you've wrapped properly, your last pass should end with the velcro around your wrist to keep it snugly in place.








, Boxing wrap pressure is important. If you apply boxing wraps too tightly, you may lose circulation in your hands. You want to secure your knuckles so you can throw solid punches, but you also want to feel comfortable.









A properly applied wrap should feel comfortable when your fingers and relaxed and feel snug when you make a fist. Check your wraps after thirty minutes of working out. If your fingers are turning white or you feel that the wrap is uncomfortable, loosen it and wrap again to get them feeling more comfortable.

Learn this side kick because it is the basic side kick performed in Taekwondo.,
Hold on to a wall for balance.,
Stand sideways to the target and lift the knee of your front leg.,
Drive your knee out towards your target and extend fully.,
Bend your knee again and then place it on the ground.,
Work on your standing foot.,
Start with your standing foot pointed forward at your target.,
Begin rotating your standing foot as you start lifting your kicking knee.,
Rotate your foot to open up your hips and generate power.,
Keep your knee up at all times.,
Stretch out your foot and make contact with the blade of your foot.,
Finish your kick and bring your foot back down.,
Practice your side kick often.",How to Do A Side Kick1," The side kick is one of the most powerful strikes in martial arts and will also impress grading panels in competitions. It is also relatively safe from counterattacks because your body is turned sideways.


This side kick is the most commonly used version in Taekwondo and should be learned before advancing to other side kicks.;
, You should practice your side kick step by step to ensure you are using the correct technique. Hold on to a chair or wall to help you balance while learning the motion of your kicking foot.

, Your ankle should be flexed and the blade of your foot should be ready to strike. The blade of your foot is the outside edge, which you will use to strike your target. When you lift your knee you should be pointing your heel at the target.


Although you would normally turn your body sideways during the side kick, for now you should start sideways to practice the motion of the kicking foot only.
This is a straight kick so you must have your heel pointing at the target before straightening your leg., Straighten your leg and bring your foot to the body height of the opponent. You should try to get as much of your sole facing the ground as possible so think of your big toe lifting up and your little toes pointing down.


You will always strike with the blade of your foot for this strike so make sure you remember this.
Aim to the body of your opponent.
Make sure that your heel is higher than your toes when striking.

, Bend the knee back to its original position before bringing your leg down to the ground. , Now that you have practiced the motion of the kicking foot, you will add the motion of the standing foot. The standing foot is key to your side kick and is extremely important for generating power and maintaining balance.


Pay very close attention to the movement of this foot.

, Start from your normal fighting stance. A common fighting stance is to stand with your left foot in front and right foot in back facing mostly sideways. Your right hand would be by your chin with your left 12-16 inches (30-40 cm) in front of your left shoulder.

, Your foot should rotate through 180 degrees during the entire side kick. This means that by the time you strike your target your standing foot will be pointing backwards. , Rotating your foot all the way around will open up your hips so that your foot can strike the target at the correct position. This rotation also provides the power of the side kick.


You can push off your foot as it turns so that you can use your strong hip, bum and core muscles to drive your kicking foot out at your target.
This rotation means you turn power from the ground into the power going forward in the kick, making the kick stronger and harder.
As a beginner you can rotate your foot before straightening your knee to strike your target. As you progress make sure you are rotating your foot at the very end of your strike (when your knee is almost straightened) so that you rotate your hip into the kick. This generates more power and strength.

, Your knee should be in the same position from when you first bring it up, through making contact with your foot and while bringing your foot back to your body.


For example, if you bring your knee to waist height at first it should stay at waist height when you make contact with the target and while you bring your foot back to your body.
Dropping your knee will cause a loss of power and will prevent your kick from going horizontally through the target.

, Straighten your knee, bringing the blade of your foot into contact with the target.


Be sure you use the same technique as earlier, where you flexed your foot to keep your sole facing the ground as much as possible.

, Bend your knee again and then bring your foot down to the ground. You should be turned sideways when you land back on the ground.


Your non-kicking foot will rotate back about 90 degrees to point in the direction you are facing. , Keep practicing to make sure you retain balance and generate maximum power by rotating and using proper technique. You should also work on your hip mobility and hip strength in order to improve your side kick. "

First things first, the armada is a kick executed by the foot w/c is in the back, so your kicking foot must be the one behind.,
Shift a bit of your weight to your kicking foot as you slide it (the foot) to the left (for left foot) or right (for right).,
Turn 180 degrees (to the left if the left foot is the kicking foot and vice versa) and place your supporting foot next to your kicking foot, feet should be at least a foot apart.

,
Turn another 180 degrees ON YOUR SUPPORTING FOOT'S HEEL (counterclockwise if using left as kicking foot and vice versa) while raising your left (or right) foot to kick in a circular manner.

Return your leg back to where it was or if it's easier land on the foot that you kicked with, then slide your foot back.",How to Do a Front Kick," Many schools will have you execute a front kick off a front stance. To perform a front stance, lean forward while bringing one of your legs forward and bend your front leg at a near 45º angle. Straighten out your back leg. If done correctly, you should appearing to be leaning forward, and you should feel a slight stretch in your back leg muscles.


Naturally, this stance is mostly used in martial arts schools. In practical cases, such as defending yourself out on the streets, you will probably want to execute a front kick from a fighting stance.;
, This is called a chamber. To do a chest-level kick, bring your chamber up to your chest. To do a low-level kick , lift your leg and chamber it toward his or her knee.

, Strike your target using the ball of your foot or instep. The ball of your foot is located just underneath your big toe. Curl your toes back as you kick to ensure that you don't accidentally hit with your toes. If you want to kick with your instep, point your toes instead.

, Curl your leg back to the same location that you originally chambered your leg.

,


If you are performing ""line drills"" in a school, you may want to drop your front foot down to the front into a new front stance, so that you can execute the next kick with your other leg.

Learn the competition guidelines from the athletic commission in your state.,
Get your trainer to help you.,
Wrap the wrist.,
Start wrapping the palm.,
Secure a gauze pad on the top of your knuckles.,
Finish the job with tape.",How to Apply Boxing Wraps2," To keep the playing ground level, most states regulate the amount of wrapping boxers are allowed to use for a fight. Generally, the rule is one roll of gauze of a particular length for the fighter.


According to the Association of Boxing Commissions, ""Hand wraps shall be restricted to no more than twenty (20) yards of soft gauze, not more than two (2) inches wide. The gauze shall be held in place by no more than eight (8) feet of adhesive tape, no more than one and one-half (1 ½) inches wide. The adhesive tape shall not cover any part of the knuckles when the hand is clenched to make a fist. The use of water, or any other liquid or material, on the tape is strictly prohibited. Hand wraps shall be applied in the dressing room in the presence of a Commission representative and, if requested, one representative of the other boxer.""

, Generally, competition wraps are done by the trainer, because its very difficult to wrap your own wrists and place the knuckle-guard patch on your hand without the thumb-strap on traditional training wraps. Before a fight, have your corner man wrap your hands under the supervision of a representative of the boxing commission in your state.


Most trainers have particular methods and ways they like to wrap wrists for a fight, but the general principles are basically the same--keep the fist tight and secure, offering some protection for the loose knuckle joints.

, Using the roll, start wrapping around your straight wrist joint. Bring the gauze around the wrist several times (10-20) and focus on securing the wrist as securely as possible. Most trainers won't use tape as this stage, but will use the wrap to keep itself secure around the wrist.








, Most competition wraps won't go between the individual fingers, so the wrapping process itself is much less complicated and variable. Continue creating X patterns around the thumb and palm to secure the knuckles and around the wrist. After you've gone several times around the knuckles, you're ready to add a pad for extra security.








, Many trainers will use an extra thick pad of gauze placed on top of the knuckles and wrapped in place using the wrap. This offers extra protection and some padding for the knuckles themselves.








Flex your hand frequently and make a fist during the job to make sure the wrapping is comfortable and not too tight. Often, the wrap will become tight on the outside edge of the hand as a result of bringing it around so many times. Be aware of this and let the trainer know if the wrap is uncomfortable.

, Rules vary from place to place, so be sure you're in accordance with the local boxing commission when you tape the wrap on. Use athletic tape around the wrist to secure the end of the wrap and finish the job.









Some trainers like to make sure the wrap doesn't slip back off the knuckles when the boxer puts the tight gloves on, and will use little strips of tape between each of the knuckles to keep it tight to the back of the hand. Strictly speaking, this isn't allowed in some places, however.

Practice.",How to Do a Butterfly Kick," The butterfly kick is a rotating movement, so during the kick your head will be facing the opposite direction from your legs.


Work out which direction you want your kick to land and then begin by facing that direction.
Also work out if you want to travel from left to right, or right to left. In the explanation that follows, we will be traveling from right to left.;
, This stance, which is sometimes called forward stance, is the correct starting position for your kick.Place your legs slightly wider than hip width apart.
Place both feet at 45 degrees angles, as if at 2 o'clock on a clock face.
Get into a lunging position. Your back leg should be straight and your front leg bent at a 90 degree angle.
Turn your hips in the direction of your front leg., Placing your arms in the right starting position will allow you to build momentum for your rotation.


While in bow stance, stretch the arm that corresponds to your straight leg in front of you with the shoulder by your ear.
The arm that corresponds to your bent leg should be pointed behind you, with your upper arm close to the side of your torso.Your hands should be flat with the fingers stretching away from your body in both directions.

, Footwork is important to execute the butterfly kick, here's how to get the footwork right.


Starting from the bow position, pivot both feet 90 degrees. Do this by staying on the balls of your feet and lifting your heels off the ground.
Shift your weight to the leg that was previously straight in the bow position.
If you are traveling from right to left, you will therefore pivot your feet so that the toes point 45 degrees to the left.
Bend the left leg and transfer most of your weight to it.

, During the rotating movement, whip your arms as if drawing semi-circles in the air.For example, the arm that was initially up by your ear in the starting position (in this case, the right arm), should end up stretched out behind you with the hand pointing down to the ground.
Similarly, you should swing the arm that was initially stretched out behind you (in this case, the left arm) upwards. It should to come to rest by your left ear.
These arm movements give you vital momentum to take off with your kick.
The direction is less important than maintaining good extension away from your body with the arms.

, As you are pivoting your feet and bending the left leg, bend your body forward, hinging at the hips so that your chest is parallel to the floor.Make sure to keep your back straight as you bend forward.
Maintaining a straight back gives the butterfly kick its distinctive look.

, As you began to pivot, you have transferred your weight to your left leg, which was initially the straight leg in bow stance.


Keep pivoting until you execute a full 180 degree turn.
At this point your head will be facing the back wall or the opposite direction that you were facing when you began your jump.

, As you are pivoting with the left foot, kick your right leg out behind you.

, When you are mid-kick, all parts of the body are off the floor and your limbs are extended out from your body in a dynamic motion.

, Your left leg will come down after the right. Bend the landing leg and straighten the left leg and you will find you are in the same bow stance that you started in.

, As you are kicking, point the toes of both feet and extend your legs as much as possible. This will make your kick more aesthetically pleasing.

, When you are rotating make sure that your chest stays parallel to the floor and that your head looks up.


Fix your gaze on something ahead of you, this technique is called spotting.
Imagine that you are locking eyes with your opponent.

, This is a relatively simple move but it requires practice to build strength and accuracy. The more you practice the better, dedicate a few minutes per day and you will begin to notice improvement.


Get a qualified person to spot you when you are just beginning. They can help by holding your arm and pulling you through as you rotate.Practice with a wall bar to support your weight, to help you build up to the full kick."

Use the skipping side kick to bring you closer to your target for the side kick.,
Start from your normal fighting position.,
Turn your feet and body completely sideways.,
Jump up and forward at the same time.,
Bring your front knee to your chest as you are jumping.,
Extend your kick straight out and make contact.,
Rotate your non-kicking foot all the way around as you straighten your kicking knee.,
Land with your foot in front of you.,
Practice both sides.",How to Do A Side Kick2," The skipping side kick is used to bring you in range of your target so that you can make contact with the side kick. This kick is also called the hop step side kick.


You should master the normal side kick before attempting the skipping side kick.

, You will usually begin from this position so it is best to practice from here. A common position is to stand with your left foot in front and right in back facing mostly sideways. Your right hand would be by your chin with your left 12-16 inches (30-40 cm) in front of your left shoulder.

, This gives you an advantage when you move forward into your kick later. Keep your knees bent so that you can move easily from this position., This is the “hop” or “skip” or the skipping side kick. Move forwards toward your target as you jump. You should be jumping off both feet at the same time.


You will not be jumping in a huge leap forward. You will just be jumping to bring your body and leg to the right distance from your target for your side kick. , The higher you can bring your knee to your chest, the higher you will be able to kick your target. , You can make contact with either the sole or the heel of your foot.


If you are sparring, then it is better to strike with the sole of your foot.
If you are trying to break something such as a brick or board you should use the heel of your foot. This way you drive all the strength and force of your kick through your heel, which is the strongest part of your foot. , You will rotate your non-kicking foot until it is facing backwards to gain more power in your kick. As you straighten out the last bit of your knee, rotate your foot to bring the strength of your hip into the kick.


This should be the same as the normal side kick. , Bend your knee and then bring your foot down to the ground. You will land with your foot in front of you rather than bringing it back. , It is equally important to practice this kick with the other foot as well. Keep practicing often with both legs to develop muscle memory for the kick. This will make it easier and quicker in sparring sessions.

Use the reverse side kick for power generation in competition or practice.,
Start from your fighting stance.,
Pre-pivot your front leg.,
Turn your head over your shoulder to look at your target.,
Swing your kicking leg to the front while bringing your kicking knee to your chest.,
Straighten your knee to strike your target.,
Bend your knee and land back on the ground.",How to Do A Side Kick3," This side kick is similar to the normal side kick except there is a spin in it. The reverse side kick is especially useful for sparring or when someone is attacking you because you can do it while fading away from or moving into your target.


This kick is also called a spinning side kick.

, You will start from your fighting stance where you have one foot in front and the other behind. Your back hand should be by your chin with your front hand 12-16 inches (30-40 cm) away from your front shoulder.

, Turn your front foot so that it is pointing behind you or away from your target. This means that you will turn your foot 180 degrees around. You will have to begin turning your hips at the same time as you turn your foot.

, Your head should follow the direction of rotation of your foot. This means you will be looking over the shoulder that is on the same side as your kicking foot.


For example, if your front foot is your right foot then you turn your right foot so that it is pointed back and bring your head around counterclockwise. You will then be looking over your left shoulder at your target.

, This swing is similar to that of a normal side kick. Bring your back foot around and bend your knee as you rotate your body. Your knee should now be at your chest and there should be a straight line between your hip, heel and the target.


For example, if your kicking foot (back foot) is your left foot then you will continue rotating counterclockwise while bringing your left knee to your chest. There should then be a straight line between your left hip, left heel and the target.
This is the “spin” of the spinning (or reverse) side kick.
This side kick gains additional power from this spin due to the momentum. The smoother and faster your spin is, the stronger your kick will be.

, Straighten the knee to kick out and strike your target. You will usually want to hit at chest height but you can aim for other areas as well.


You should strike with the blade (outside edge) of the foot or the heel. These areas will transmit the most power to your target.

, Bring your knee back to your chest and then step forward or straight down with your kicking foot. This should bring you back to your fighting stance with the other foot in front compared to when you began the kick.

Use the flying side kick to impress your friends.,
Start from the normal fighting position.,
Move forward towards your target.,
Jump off your non-kicking foot and swing your kicking foot up.,
Bring your knee to your chest.,
Straighten your knee into contact.,
Strike with the blade or heel of the foot.,
Bend your knee and land.",How to Do A Side Kick4," The flying side kick is an advanced technique that is often used for demonstration purposes. If they are done correctly in a fight, they can also be very effective.


This is a longer range technique than a regular side kick.
The run-up to the kick provides a lot of momentum, making this a very powerful kick.

, A common fighting position is to stand with your left foot in front and right foot in back with your body turned almost all the way to the side. Your right fist will be by your chin with your left 12-16 inches (30-40 cm) from your left shoulder.

, If you are kicking a target then you can take one or two steps only but if you are trying to jump over a target then you may need to get a running start for more speed and power.

, Plant your non-kicking foot (the front foot) solidly on the ground and push off of it to get into the air. As you push off turn your body to the side to swing your kicking foot into the front.


You should also bring your non-kicking foot up so that your opponent cannot sweep it away from you.

, While swinging your kicking foot into place be sure to bend your knee up the same as you would do for a normal side kick. This bend of your knee creates a lot of extra power when it is straightened, so keeping your leg straight will lead to a much weaker kick.


The farther you bring your knee to your chest, the stronger your kick will be.
Keep your heel pointing towards your target.

, Straighten at the very end of the strike. Timing is very important here so you must practice often to learn how to time your kick properly.


A lot of your power comes from straightening your knee at the correct time. Be sure you are the right distance from your target to straighten fully but not so far that the kick barely touches the target.

, The blade of your foot and heel are the strongest parts of your foot. Your heel is especially strong so if you are going for a knock-out kick then you should strike with the heel for maximum power.


Striking with the blade (or outside edge) of the foot is also effective and helps your ankle to absorb the impact of the kick.

, Bring your knee back to your chest and land. You may find it helps to keep turning in the direction of your rotation and go a full circle to get back into the proper fighting stance.


Thus if you are kicking with your right foot, then after the strike you can keep turning counterclockwise to complete a full circle and face the target once more.
Make sure you land on your feet and stay balanced.

You can use a punching bag, a partner holding a pad or just shadow kick without anything at all. , Your legs should be slightly spread at a bit more than shoulders width with one leg in front and the other in back. Your kicking leg will be in front. Keep your fists up in front of your face.


You should practice this with both legs so try it in both directions. After practicing with one leg, switch your stance and practice with the other leg also.
Your hands should be in front of your chin and mouth to protect your face.
You should be sideways to your target. , This bent knee creates the power for your shot so bring it up as high as possible.

, Straighten your knee directly forward into contact. You should make contact with the blade, or outside edge, of your foot because it will be stronger and safer for your kick.


Make sure you are extending straight forward into contact. This means you will have to be turning your body and hips simultaneously.
Think of the kick as a stomping motion to give you extra power and strength.
Do not lock out your knee, or extend it completely, or else you could hurt yourself. You will want to maintain a slight bend even when making contact. , You must rotate your non-kicking foot at the same time to create extra power and strength in your kick. It should end up facing almost completely backwards when you make contact with your target.


The non-kicking foot should rotate about 180 degrees so that it faces backwards when you make contact.
This rotation is very important so make sure it is moving correctly during your kick.
It will feel like you are giving your back to the target because you are rotating your hips into the kick. , Bend your knee again after contact to bring your knee back to your chest. Bring your foot down to the ground directly in front of you.


Your non-kicking foot will have to rotate back to its original position when landing.
You can shuffle back after your foot is on the ground to bring you away from your opponent. "

If you are grabbed on from behind,step forward and then move backwards and to the side simultaneously, this should throw the attacker off balance and you will literally throw him or her over your shoulder.,
If he or she grabs your arm with his or her hand, straighten your fingers as if you were trying to make your hand as flat as possible, and pull against where his or her fingers are.,
If you are getting jumped,try not to get thrown on the ground or you will find it difficult to defend yourself from the attacker.

",How to Defend Yourself from an Attacker," Fighting an individual should only be considered a last-resort method. Exhaust your options before you physically defend yourself.;
, Turn your body to the side so that your right shoulder is facing your attacker. Raise your fists into the air to protect your body -- not too high, so that you don't end up blocking your line of sight, but not too low as to offer no protection to your head.

, To block a punch, use an open hand and push the fist out of the way enough so that it does not hit you somewhere that it may cause damage, such as your head, stomach, or groin.

, Avoid using ""wild hook"" punches, where you throw your entire arm and shoulder into a punch in a manner that is similar to a large C. From a fighting stance, a punch should come out from the center of your body. You will want your punch to come in quickly and return quickly -- don't leave your arm hanging out where the attacker can grab it. You can also kick to do damage. A kick should come from the foot that is back in the fighting stance. Bring up the leg and lash out bringing it back in so the attacker has no chance to grab it.

, This may seem like a silly and trivial thing to consider, but knowing how to throw a punch with a proper fist can save you from hurting yourself. You will want to keep your fist closed and tight. Your thumb should be located on or underneath your index and middle finger . Do not place your thumb inside of your closed fist -- you can break your thumb if you hit a person hard enough. If you stick your thumb out, you can also break it. Be certain that you keep your wrist straight when throwing a punch, as this can also help prevent you from injuring yourself.

, Posture is everything: keep a straight back, fair walking pace (but not too fast or you'll appear suspicious and frightened), hold your head high and if you are particularly walking through a bad area, resist the urge to look away from those around you. Look everyone in the eye but keep focused on your destination. This does three things: lets people know you are alert, allows you to identify anyone, allows you to say hello if you know anyone.

, Attackers will often approach their victims, trying to play it innocent or to threaten you for money. This will mostly happen in a quiet place where you might expect people to be e.g. down the road at night. Keep an eye out for people who might approach you.

, If someone approaches you, then stand with your feet slightly apart, back and head straight, and push your arms straight out in front of you, palms forward as if to push them away. Command ""Stop!"" loudly. This pose will make you look strong, sure and confident of what you're doing - another deterrent to an attack. If the person does stop, but does not walk away, then firmly ask him or her questions such as ""Are you following me?"" ""Why are you following me?"" ""What do you want?"". Question his or her motives, and try to find out their intentions, but keep holding this stance. Do not move from that pose. By doing this you also find out more about your enemy and what he or she is trying to do, which is always a good thing to know. If he or she does reply, then it might be possible to persuade him or her away from his or her original aims and come to a compromise. You may even need to offer him or her money to leave you alone, as long as you have a reasonable amount on you (he or she probably wouldn't accept a pocketful of loose change - something like $50 might just be acceptable). It's better to lose money than your life.

, If you are right-handed, then step your right foot behind you. If you are left-handed, step your left foot behind you. Don't step your foot too far behind you or this will freeze you from moving about a lot; the usual rule is put your foot about a shoulder width behind you. The foot behind you provides a pillar in case the attacker pushes you, which will stop you from falling onto your back. Because once you're on your back, it's over. This stance is similar to a boxing stance, but you put your foot behind you a bit more. The back foot can be used to kick the opponent. Following from the footing in the stance, hold your opposite arm from your natural preference i.e. right-handers hold your left arm up, fists clenched, in front of your face. This is your defending arm, which you use to deflect an attack. Your right/left arm should be poised slightly lower for attack, so that any fist aimed at your face will be blocked by your defending arm and then you can punch in the gap at the attacker.

, If this follows successfully then it will shock him or her enough to give you time to run away.

, This will disorient your opponent, break his or her nose, and allow you to get away. When you punch, yell loudly; this serves to strengthen your punch and surprises the opponent. It also serves to attract attention. If you do have to punch to defend yourself, do not do it halfway hard - a weak punch, even if it connects, will not do the job and may just anger your opponent. Punch as if your life depended on it, because it might. You can also upper-cut them. An upper cut is a punch that is thrown and aimed for the under side of the chin.

, With your free hand grab his or her arm on that side and step a foot out so that you can pull away after impact.

, This works better if the attacker is taller than you are. Try this out on a friend first to practice.

, Making your hand flat stiffens the bone in your arm, making it easier to get out of someone's grasp, even if he or she is stronger than you.

Synchronize your breathing with your kick.,
Get in your guard.,
Keep your arms raised, ready to attack and block.,
Bring your leg up and to the side.,
Snap your leg forward, pivoting on your other foot.,
Retract your leg and return to your guard.,
Try using alternate kicking techniques.",How to Do a Roundhouse Kick1," Breath control is important for any form of exercise, but in a fight, it's essential — you want to be able to move, duck, block, and kick as quickly as possible without running out of breath or getting the wind knocked out of you, Take deep, steady breaths when your opponent is out of reach. Breathe in as you prepare to make your kick, then exhale forcefully or vocalize (grunt, shout, etc.) each time you kick (or get kicked). Pace yourself as you fight — if you feel yourself running out of energy, back off and take deep breaths to refocus and recoup your stamina.









Paying attention to your breathing isn't just for improving your focus and stamina — there's actually scientific evidence to suggest that exhaling or vocalizing during physical exertion (like kicking) can make it possible to exert more force.;
, In karate and most other forms of martial arts, your ""guard"" is your basic fighting stance — the way you hold your body in between making your own blows and blocking your opponent's. Your guard makes it easy to strike quickly and powerfully and to react to your opponent's attacks, so it's the ideal place to start before making a roundhouse kick.


If you are right handed, to get in your guard, first take a big step forward with your left leg, letting your right foot naturally pivot so it points out to the side. Make two fists and raise your hands so that both arms are bent at the elbow and your forearms are raised slightly. Your left fist should be higher and farther forward than your right, which should be close to your waist.If you're left handed, simply reverse the directions above: step forward with your right foot, drop your left foot back, and so on.

, If you're practicing roundhouse kicks by yourself, you can take as long as you want to carefully execute your moves. This isn't the case in an actual fight, where letting down your guard momentarily can give your opponent the opening they need to strike. Even if you're not practicing with a partner, get in the habit of keeping your hands up before and after you make your kick. When you do eventually need to use your moves in a fight, having your hands up by default will make you less vulnerable to your opponent's attacks and make it much easier to respond to the attacks they do make with your own.

, As you raise your rear leg for the kick, bend it back upon itself so that the back of the calf is almost touching the thigh. Bring the bent leg up so that the knee is pointing out to the side. You'll probably need to lean your upper body in the opposite direction for balance. At this point, the muscle in the leg is bunched up and the lower leg is ""chambered"", ready to deliver a quick, crushing kick.








If you haven't done a roundhouse kick before, you may find it tricky to balance on one foot with your leg out to the side. Luckily, there are a number of simple balance-improving exercises (like standing on one foot while waiting in line at the supermarket) that are easy to work into your daily routine.

, Pivot on your lower foot, turning your body so that your kicking leg moves toward your target. As you do this, extend the leg in a sudden but smooth motion, ""snapping"" it forward. You should make contact with the target before your leg is fully extended. In other words, your knee should still be somewhat bent when your leg hits the target — this delivers maximum power.









Try to connect with the top of your foot, the ball of your foot, or your instep. Alternatively, you can use your shinbone — this can be especially devastating to your opponent, but can be very painful for you as well., As you make contact, roll through your target. Let your leg deliver its full power, penetrating a few inches into the body. Quickly retract your leg to its folded position. At this point, you can either ""chamber"" the leg for another kick or return it to the floor.









The less time your foot or leg is in contact with your target's body, the better. Quick, ""snappy"" kicks transfer lots of energy in the form of damaging shock, while slower kicks use some of their energy to push the target, which is less damaging.

, The basic roundhouse kick detailed above is great for beginners, but it's just one of many possible variations on the move. To increase your versatility during a fight, try learning one or more variations on the basic roundhouse kick. Once mastered, these special moves can give your kick extra speed or power, giving you an edge in a close fight. See the sections below for more detailed explanations of each guard.









Use a ""side-kick"" technique for a quick, direct attack. In a fight between experienced martial artists, speed can be a huge factor in determining the winner. Using this stance can help you release (and recover from) your kick with extra quickness all while advancing on your opponent, allowing you to set the pace of the fight.
Use a muay thai kicking technique for power and strength. Sudden, powerful blows can decide entire fights. For situations that call for sudden, forceful blows, using this muay thai kick style, which prioritizes the strength of the kick, can be a wise choice.
Use a boxing guard to protect yourself. The basic karate-inspired martial arts guard stance above offers a balanced platform for delivering and blocking blows, but in street fights, bare-knuckle brawls, and self-defense scenarios, it may be hard to use it to block a flurry of punches to the head or body. In these cases, a boxing-inspired guard may make for a more practical defense.

Raise your leg in front of you.,
Turn your leg parallel to the floor.,
Quickly snap your leg forward.,
Retract your leg as quickly as possible.",How to Do a Roundhouse Kick2," The main difference between a basic roundhouse kick and a side kick is that the latter is delivered from in front of the target, rather than from the side. Starting from your basic guard stance, raise your rear leg out in front of you (not out to the side like you would for an ordinary roundhouse kick), bending at the knee as you do so.

, Before you deliver your side kick, you want your leg to be parallel with the floor — in other words, the inside of your leg should be facing the floor and your knee should be pointing directly to the side. This requires you to make a few separate movements at once — though they sound complicated, they should actually feel quick and natural after plenty of practice. Do the following:









Pivot with your foot on the ground to turn your body so that your bent kicking leg comes in line with your target.
Lean away from your kicking leg with your upper body to keep it elevated and maintain your balance.
Use your hip muscles to pull your kicking leg up. It should be basically parallel to the floor (or as close as you're able to get it) before you make your kick — the strength of the side kick is in its quick, direct forcefulness.

, In a single smooth but sudden motion, extend your leg as quickly as you can, making contact with the outer bottom edge of your foot. Ideally, for maximum kicking force, you want your upper body and kicking leg to make a straight line to your target roughly parallel to the floor — this will require you to keep your leg high, lean with your upper body, and turn at the hips as you deliver your kick.









As you make your kicking motion, continue to pivot on your standing foot. A full side kick requires about 180o of rotation — your foot will start facing toward your target and end facing away from it as you kick connects., When you feel your kick connect firmly, withdraw it immediately (as you would for a normal roundhouse) for the greatest possible striking force. Return to a standing position by pivoting your standing foot back forward and lowering your kicking leg to the ground (or, alternatively, perform more kicks).









Not only is the side kick quick and powerful — it's also versatile in terms of striking targets. Depending on how high you're able to raise your leg, it's possible to deliver a side kick anywhere from an opponent's leg or groin to their face. Hip flexibility is essential for raising your leg high enough to hit upper body targets. If you can't get your side kick above an opponent's waist, try starting a regimen of hip stretches to improve your flexibility.

Get into the basic roundhouse guard stance.,
Pivot on your front foot as you swing your rear leg forward.,
Swing your arm for extra power as your kick.,
Connect with your opponent.",How to Do a Roundhouse Kick3," This powerful roundhouse kick variation uses a different stance than you'd use for an ordinary kick. Take a step forward with your non-kicking foot, then turn your body so your feet are roughly shoulder-width apart. Turn the toes of your rear foot out to the side. Stand up straight with your weight on the balls of your feet and your fists clenched in front of your chest or chin.


For muay thai kicks, try to put a little more weight on the back foot than on the front foot. This gives you stability as you react to your opponent's moves and try to set up your kick. When you make your kick, you'll transfer your weight to the other foot for additional power.

, To begin your kick, pivot on the ball of your front foot, turning your toes outwards and your heel towards your opponent. As you do this, raise your leg up and around your body in a smooth arc, putting a bend in your knee as you do so. Try to raise your leg to at least the level of your opponent's waist — your knee should be pointing at or near the center of your opponent's body by the point you start to deliver your kick.









At the end of the swing, the hip of your kicking leg should be stacked directly above the hip of your standing leg. Most of the stability and power for the kick will come from this solid pillar of support.

, Snap your leg forward as normal, aiming to connect just at or before the point your leg fully extends. As you do this, introduce greater power and speed to your kick by throwing the arm on your kicking side down in a synchronized motion with your kick.









Note that this motion leaves you slightly more vulnerable to a counterattack because your swinging arm can't block attacks, so make sure to keep your other hand up to protect your head and face while you make this movement.

, Connect with your opponent's torso or head at your shin or the top of your foot. Try to hit your opponent like a baseball bat, coming in from the side (around his guard) rather than straight on. Once you have made impact, withdraw your leg as quickly as possible for maximum striking power (just as you would for the kicking styles above).









As directed above, follow your kick up with another kick or return to your starting position, pivoting your standing foot back around as you do so. Whichever option you use, be sure to return your kicking arm back to its guard position as quickly as possible to protect against a counterattack.

Stay light on your feet.,
Keep your hands up near your head.,
Bring your leg into the ""chambered"" position.,
Kick as normal.",How to Do a Roundhouse Kick4," In the words of Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest boxers of all time, ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."" For boxers, mobility is key for reacting to an opponent's moves, dodging punches, and setting up combinations. Using this boxing-inspired guard stance, it can be easier to block and dodge an opponent's blows while setting up your roundhouse kick.


To start, rather than using the one-foot-back-one-foot-forward guard stance described above, you'll want to stay mobile, constantly taking short, choppy steps. This makes it easier to dodge your opponent's blows and ""dance"" out of their reach when you're recovering between blows.

, Bend your elbows and raise your hands so that they are several inches from your chin (ideally with fists clenched, though this isn't necessarily essential). Keep your elbows tucked against your body, but don't tense your upper body — stay loose and relaxed.Your forearms should form a ""cage"" around the bottom of your head, protecting it from blows from the front. If your opponent tries to punch or kick you in the head, you can bring your arms together for more protection.


This guard stance leaves your torso and midsection relatively unprotected — you can counter this somewhat by staying low and keeping your shoulders forward. You can also block body blows by dropping your guard low with your forearms crossed, though this will leave your head open.

, Once you've gotten the hang of the boxing guard stance, try performing a few kicks (you can use a basic roundhouse kick, a side kick, or a muay thai style kick — whichever you find easiest). Bring your kicking leg out to the side or in front of you with the knee bent all the way. As you do this, pivot on your standing foot and lean your upper body for balance until your leg is sufficiently raised. As you do this, don't forget to keep your guard up near your head — a smart opponent may use your set-up time to get in a free punch.









Though the boxing guard can be more practical for protecting yourself in a fight, staying balanced can be a little trickier with this stance, so be sure to practice plenty before you try performing a roundhouse kick in an actual self-defense scenario.

, Snap your leg out out, extending it as quickly as possible. Make contact with your target, then withdraw your kick as quickly possible for maximum striking force. Follow up with another kick or drop your leg to the floor and start taking quick, light steps with your guard up, ready to react to your opponent.

, It doesn't matter who is grabbing you, if you can get one of their fingers (especially the pinky or index finger) they won't last long. Just pry it off and pull backward. Be careful with friends because this could break a finger if you do it too fast.

, If you can, lean to one side and throw an elbow back at their head. Do this very fast and yell while you do it. This will surely surprise any attacker.

, If they are holding you in the air, swing a leg back and up right into the groin (supposing the attacker is a man). Even this will take several hits though.

, If you are still rooted on the ground, try to bend forward. They will have no leverage if you have them leaning over your back. Put one of your legs behind theirs and throw your butt upwards, your torso forwards, and your shoulders toward the leg you used. They should flip, but be prepared to go down yourself.

, If you and your attacker are roughly the same size/weight, simply sit down. They can't lift you, or do anything else unless they let go. Since this is an under-arm bear hug, fold your arms down over theirs, grab their wrists, and now by sitting down, you have them in a lever position. I recommend grabbing opposite wrists for better application (ie. your right hand grabs their left wrist).

, Ukemi (breakfalls) are what stops the fall from hurting and, without them, you'll be black and blue very quickly. Falling the wrong way can also knock the wind from you, which is uncomfortable and cuts into your practice time. Done properly, getting thrown should not hurt at all. Protect your head. If you know someone is going to drop to their knees during a throw then tuck it in to prevent it hitting the mat.

, At gradings, this will work in your favour; for example, if you grasp your opponent's leg with your legs while you are being held down, the hold is broken.

, There is no substitute for practice, and no amount of reading about judo can replace actual practice, so stop being lazy and get stuck in!!

Try to make a T with your opponent's body.",How to Do a Double Leg Takedown1," The shoot is the building block of lots of wrestling takedowns. The double-leg takedown is essentially a quick shoot in at your opponent's lower body that ends with you wrapping up the legs and dropping to the mat. Since a good wrestler will practice shoots frequently throughout the week, it's a good way of starting to think about getting a double-leg takedown into your repertoire of moves.Stay in your stance with your lead leg slightly forward, bent over at the hips, with your head up.
Take a penetration step with your lead foot and place your knee in between their legs. As you do this, lower your level to make your center of gravity lower which gives you more balance and makes the shot much more difficult to block.
Bring your trail leg up while your front knee secures your position on the mat, keeping your hands in a defensive position. Bring your front leg back up and return to the staggered stance. Practice strings of these shoots regularly to get into good wrestling shape.;
, To execute the takedown properly, you need to get low enough and close enough to get past your opponent's defense. That's partially speed, which will come with practice, but also shooting from the right position. For some wrestlers, that can be as many as two or three feet, while others may need to be in closer. You need to be close enough to maintain balance in your shoot step, so it doesn't turn into an advantage for your opponent.


Some wrestlers can shoot from farther away, while some need to be closer to do it properly. Practice your doubles on sparring partners to learn how close you need to be to do it properly with your strength and speed.

, To shoot in, push off with your trailing foot from the staggered position and get your lead foot between your opponent's feet. Keep your elbows in tight as you're preparing to shoot in for the takedown, maintaining a good defensive positioning and stance, and stay as low as possible.While you are taking the penetration step, lower your level to give yourself more balance and make the shot harder to counter. You should end up with your knee between their legs.

, Do this by wrapping your hands around the outside of their legs and grabbing the inside of their knees.

, Then put your head on the side of their hip so your can push their body with your head.


Trying to wrap up too high on the legs might seem like a better way of controlling your opponent, but most wrestlers' thighs will be much too strong to control with your upper body. It's unlikely you'll be able to overpower the other wrestler's center of gravity.
Putting your ear to the side of their hip make everything tighter. Plus, not doing it leaves your head in in either of two different places: Either in the middle, which isn't good; or way off to the side, which is awkward and can make your throw less powerful.

, You shot in and wrapped up your opponent, but now it's still up to you to get back to the mat and get some points. To make it happen, bring your trailing foot forward, without dragging your knee, and push off with your lead foot, taking a little stagger step to the outside of your opponent's body, if necessary. Keep pushing forward to drive through your opponent and take them off balance.


Your step to get up to your foot should be almost like another shoot, or a hop, powering through your opponent's body and throwing them off their gravity. You've stolen that gravity by wrapping it up, now take them down.
Keep your shoulder in tight, your arms snaked around your opponents lower legs, and driving forward and your opponent should be on the mat in no time. Keep moving forward

, When you take your opponent onto the back, keep pressure on his torso with your shoulder, as if you were trying to drive through the other wrestler's body and into the mat. Flatten out, chest-to-chest, if you can. At this point, you've successfully executed the double-leg take down and can attempt to go for the pin, or some other offensive maneuver.


Good wrestlers will flop over onto their belly when you execute a double-leg take down. If so, this is still points for you, so take advantage of it by staying behind in a dominant position.

, Do this by entering a squatting position. Once you have accomplished this, it will be much harder to move you around and you will have bought yourself some time.

, If they are not free, go directly to the next step. If they are, skip the next one and read the one after it.

, Do anything to get free. Some suggestions are stomping on the feet and hitting (not grabbing) the groin. Once your arms are slightly loose, hit the opponent with repetitive elbows to anything you can reach. Skip the next two steps.

, Crotch slapping is less effective because of the relative positions of your arms. Chances are, the attacker won't let go. If, however, you are released, skip the next step. If the attacker does not let go, however, then you may go on to the next step. Be careful when doing it, as it will cause extreme pain and lasting damage.

Focus on set-ups.,
Set up the takedown with a strike.,
Juke-shoot to draw a knee.,
Chop your opponent's elbows.,
Start with a Russian arm bar.",How to Do a Double Leg Takedown2," The only difference between the double-leg takedown in mixed martial arts and in wrestling is the set-up. Without the right set-up for the maneuver, shooting in for a takedown of this sort in MMA can get you choked out quickly, because of the variety of strikes, chokes, and other defensive maneuvers available. For this reason, setting up your opponent for a double-leg takedown is almost more important than the maneuver itself.


If you shoot in from too far away and drop to your knee with your head in your opponent's armpit, you might as well wear a sign that says, ""Hey, guillotine-choke me!"" You've got to use this move in tandem with set-ups to get your opponents arms out of the way and get them to the ground before a strike is possible.

, One of the most straight-forward and common ways of trying to set up the double-leg takedown is by striking at the head with jabs to draw your opponent's arms up into a defensive position, then shooting in for the takedown.While this still leaves you open to a knee or to a choke, you can get past your opponent's guard if you do it quick enough.


Alternatively, faking a double-leg is sometimes a good way of dropping your opponent's arms to open up for strike attacks.

, One of the best ways of defending a quick wrestling-style shoot for a takedown is with a hard knee strike to the head. It's a quick way to end the match and a devastating strike. Since you know this, you can try to draw out a premature knee by juking in as if you're about to shoot, but pulling up short.


Practice half-shoots, in which you fake a shoot from far away, keeping your eye on your opponent's knee the whole time, to make sure you come up short when it's thrown. As soon as you see it up in the air, shoot back in to finish off the job. Your opponent will already be off-balance with one leg in the air.

, Shooting in for a double is usually best after you've worn each other down some, and your opponent is grabbing for your shoulders, rather than striking out. A quick chop upward with your hands, striking your opponent's elbows with the space between your thumb and forefinger, should be effective in breaking their grip and allowing you to shoot in for a takedown. Stay low and watch for knees, then chop upward hard, using a short jab with your hands to get your opponent's arms up. Shoot in normally.

, Another effective method of setting up a double-leg takedown in MMA is with a Russian arm bar combination, which will allow you to tangle your opponent's arms and open up the lower body for a takedown.When your opponent reaches in to grab the back of your head with one hand, grasp the forearm with a baseball-style grip, hugging it close into your body in a Russian arm bar. Your opponent's natural instinct will be to push away from you with the other hand, at which point you can duck down, shoot the barred arm up into the other arm, tangling them and getting them out of the way. Drop into your shoot for the double-leg takedown.

Determine your dominant side first.,
For your body position, square up to your opponent.,
Learn the proper foot placement.,
Keep your hands up and your elbows down at all times.,
Keep your chin down.,
Shrug your shoulders up and round them forward.",How to Assume the Krav Maga Fighting Stance," This is commonly referred to as ""orthodox"". In Krav Maga, eventually you will learn to do all techniques equally well from your offhand, or ""southpaw"" stance. Your dominant side is most likely the same hand you write with. If you are one of those rare people that truly is ambidextrous, then begin as a ""righty"", as most Krav Maga techniques are taught right handed first.
, This means that your shoulders and hips should be lined up with their shoulders and hips. You do not want your upper body bladed off, as this will make your back-most hand (cross) very strong and slow, and your front-most hand (jab) useless. If you are properly squared up to your opponent, then both your jab and cross will have knock-out power., Properly done, you will be able to deliver powerful kicks from either leg in this stance.Your feet should be about shoulder width apart such that if you had skis on, they would touch your opponent's toes.

If you are a righty, then your left foot should be about a half step forward and your right a half step back.
A lefty would switch this exactly opposite. You want to bend slightly in the knees and have both feet up on your toes so that you can quickly pivot, change level by squatting, or burst back and forward. Your toes should be pointing forward towards your opponent.
Put about 60% of your weight on your back foot and 40% on your front foot. Do not blade your legs off to your opponent, where your feet make a line pointing towards your opponent. This is like balancing on a balance beam and makes kicks from your back leg slow, and virtually removes any ability to kick with the lead leg.

, The only time this would change is when you throw a combative of your own, and this would be followed with a fast recoil back to this position. The correct height of your hands can be checked by touching your cheeks with your thumbs. This is about where they should be to protect your jaw. Your elbows should be pointed down to protect your ribs and liver from body shots and edged weapons. While it would suck to get cut across the elbow, it wouldn't be as bad as getting stabbed or your guts spilled out., Always keep your chin tucked like you're trying to hold a towel with your chin. Keep your eyes up, like you're looking through the wrinkles in your forehead. This helps protect your chin from incoming strikes. Someone could punch you in the crown of your head - and the joke would be on them as this is an extremely hard part of your head and will almost certainly break their hand (boxer's fracture)., This will bring them up around your chin. If your opponent throws a hook punch you fail to see coming, or if a second attacker you didn't know about tries to put you in a headlock, your shoulders will absorb a large amount of the impact and prevent a headlock from getting under your chin. This will also help protect you from a knife slash across the throat."
