Begin by laying on your back with your legs apart.,
Start positioning yourself.,
Pivot your hips forward.,
You now want to find a way to maneuver your one leg over the arm of your opponent that was pushed down and away from you thus making it easier when it comes time to sink in the choke.,
You want to begin wrapping your one leg around your opponent's head and shoulders always making sure his own arm is trapped in front of his own neck and head while you bring your foot towards your other leg.

,
You now want to wrap your knee around the ankle of your other foot securing your opponent in place.,
Using your legs you want to apply as much pressure as you can to the head and neck of your opponent.,
Hold the choke until your opponent either taps out, or the referee jumps in to stop the fight.

",How to Apply a Triangle Choke from Open Guard in Mixed Martial Arts," Your opponent's torso is in between your legs. This is called open guard as his movement is restricted slightly by your legs but not as much as it would be if your legs were wrapped around his torso or in “closed” guard.


Now while your opponent is trapped in your guard he will typically be trying to throw punches or elbows into your face to do damage while looking for a way to escape. The key to begin setting up your triangle choke is to grab one of his arms while he is trying to punch you and to deflect it so it moves beside your head instead of hitting it. You also want to try to keep a hold of his arm in the process.





;
, Once your opponent's attack has been deflected and his other arm pushed out of the way you start to position your own body. You do this by using your legs to push your body forward on the ground so your opponents is further away from your head. With some practice you should be able to position your own body at the same time you are protecting yourself from the attack and maneuvering the punches.

, After the previous steps have been completed your opponent should be off balance. You then want to pivot your hips forward to send your opponents body further down yours.

,


By now you should be in a position where your opponents head is down by your hips. You should also still have a firm hold of their one arm right by your shoulder. At this stage you begin to raise your legs up and over your opponents head.







,, You can grab your shin to pull the leg across your opponent's back to ease this step, but don't pull on your foot as this can break your ankle.

, You will notice that his own arm being forced against the neck restricts the airflow of your opponent. You can use one of your hands to pull down on your own foot to apply even more pressure which tightens the choke.

Go to competitions!,
Win some matches!",How to Learn to Fence," Is it for fitness, competition, or for historical appeal? All of these are legitimate reasons, and each leads to a different type of fencing and training. Fencing is an old art that has great traditions and cultures, so you may find it more enjoyable if you immerse yourself in it. Fencing is a great way to learn both mental and physical skill and discipline.But it’s also great exercise and great fun for the more casual fencer too!;
, Fencing has very strong traditions, and a number of distinct schools with different styles and approaches. The Italian, Spanish, and French schools, which can trace their histories back hundreds of years, are dominant across the world of fencing. The difference between these schools may be relatively slight, focused on the specifics of different weapons, but it is worth having a basic knowledge before you start.The first book on fencing, Treatise on Arms, was written by Spaniard Diego de Valera between 1458 and 1471.
You will also learn a little about fencing's history, which may inspire you to take up a sword.

, The next step is to find somewhere near you to get started. You may find that there are more possibilities for fencing than you imagined, so research each school within easy travelling distance. You should keep in mind the following criteria for selecting a fencing club:


Does the club match your goals? If you want to compete in tournaments, or even the Olympics, then you need a club that is highly competitive. If you want to have fun and tell Monty Python jokes, you want a more laid back club.
Does the club properly enforce safety? Are fencers allowed to use their blades while not wearing masks? If such horseplay is permitted, avoid that club.
Is the club easily accessible? Though it doesn't have to do with fencing itself, you want to be able to get to and from your club on a regular basis.
Do you know anyone who fences? Find out where they go, and what they think of the place.
Does the club have a good mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced fencers? When you're starting out, it's nice to have people at your level. Having a range of abilities generally indicates a club with some stability and longevity.
Are there enough coaches for you to have private lessons regularly? Private lessons from a coach are essential to the beginning (and intermediate through advanced) fencer.
Does it teach the weapon that you want to learn? A lot of fencing schools and clubs only teach one or two types of fencing, so make sure that they have the one that you want before you commit.

, Once you have decided on where you want to go arrange a trial period, or taster session to see what you think. You can also just sit in on a class to see how it all works, and get a feel for the coaching techniques and styles.

, Throw yourself into it, but be sure to pay attention to the style of the classes, be respectful and listen. Fencing is a combination of physical skill and mental sharpness, as well as lots of self-discipline. Be ready to really concentrate on what you are learning, which means both the theory and the practice.


The rules can be complicated so do your homework and ask about anything you are unsure of or confused by.

, Usually, they'll have a few hours a week in which you can fit in private lessons with them. Sometimes, this is not the case, and it will be necessary to take group lessons from that coach, if you want to take any at all. Take them up on this if it is offered, but try to find another coach to give you private lessons as well.

, It's important that you know how to hold your sword. Don't wave it around, and never point it at somebody who isn't wearing the protective mask. When you are holding it, keep the point of sword pointing towards the floor. If you are moving while holding the sword, hold it by the point not the handle. If you need both of your hands to take your mask on or off, be sure to put the sword down first.You should always check on the condition of your sword and ensure that the point has a covering that is intact and in a good state.

, You will need to have a solid understanding of the basic lexicon of fencing. Some of the most important terms to learn at the beginning are: En garde, Attack, Parry, Riposte, Counter Riposte. Attack is an offensive action, parry a defensive one.A riposte is a counter-attack after a parry, and a counter-risposte is an attack that follows a parry of a riposte.Take some time to read through a glossary of fencing terms to familiarize yourself with them.
Remember that some people might use the French or Italian words.

, Footwork is absolutely essential in fencing, so it's important to develop fluid and easy movement. The basics you will need to learn, however, are the En Garde position, and the simple advance and retreat. The En Garde position is your starting position. You will stand side on, leading with your sword hand, with your foot on that side pointed towards your opponent while your rear foot points out at roughly 90 degrees. When advancing the front foot leads, and when retreating the back foot leads.Try to get an even balance of weight and be on the balls of your feet so you can move quickly.
As you progress you will learn more techniques like attacking lunges.

, Before you start to learn sword techniques you have to master the grip and learn how to hold the sword properly. There are different styles and your instructor will probably have a preference for their students. Different swords also have different grips, so you have to learn these with an instructor.


A common mistake for beginners is to hold the grip too tight. You need loose and flexible wrists., Once you have got a comfortable and technically sound grip you can learn the first elements of blade work. This may depend on your instructor and weapon choice, but you can expect to learn the straight thrust and the simple parry first. These are the simple offensive and defensive moves which you will then build on with variations and additions., Once you've got started you might want to choose to focus on one weapon which you prefer. Your coach will probably present you with a choice of weapons (Foil, Epée, or Saber), or give you a foil without such a choice.Many fencing masters and coaches believe that the correct order to learn the weapons in is foil-épée-saber. Sometimes you will encounter a coach who will try to start students with Epée or Saber (this is actually fairly common among high school coaches, as they need to generate fencers in all weapons quickly).


Some believe it preferable to always start with Foil because, they assert, Foil provides point control necessary to épée, right of way ensures that you develop the correct technique, and right of way is an essential aspect of Foil and Saber.
The other side would contend that while most of this is the case for épée, you can learn right-of-way and technique perfectly from Sabre. Ultimately, it's up to you.

, Fencing is a relatively equipment-heavy sport, so find out about the special protective clothing that is required as well as the swords. Some of the protective clothing for fencing differs for genders, and comes in differing right and left-handed versions. Before thinking about buying any of the equipment, do some investigations and see if you can borrow club equipment.

, Many clubs have spare equipment stores, so borrow equipment for your first few lessons, just to make sure you like the sport enough to continue. Club equipment is often old and worn thin by use, the masks unpleasant from the sweat of fencers, and the weapons bent beyond the point of recognition as a sword. This will eventually happen to your own equipment as well, but you'll get a good few years use out of everything, at the very least.


It might be old and a bit tatty, but treat the club equipment with respect and don’t be careless with it.

, Fencing equipment can be expensive. A few hundred dollars or euros, so be completely positive that you will be fencing for some time before you go out and buy it. But be sure to talk to your coach about what to get before you go to the store. The USFA maintains a list of vendors in the US.

, Virtually all fencers agree that they're boring, but no one denies that drills will improve your fencing. A tip to make is less boring is to visualize that you are using a real weapon on a real opponent (only if you are macabre, though). But like all things, practice makes perfect.

, Spend some time just watching pro competitions to learn more about the top-level of the sport. Watching the experts can also inspire you to practice more, and increase your love of fencing by seeing it practiced so excellently. If you have the opportunity to see a big competition nearby, go for it!

, This may seem like carrying the sport to the point of fanaticism, but books about fencing are often useful. Aldo Nadi's ""On Fencing"" is a volume filled with a good number of drills, exercises, and hints and Rudy Volkman's ""Magnum Libre de Escrime"" is a fantastic resource for beginners.

, Although it might not look it to the untrained eye, fencing is a physically demanding sport. Work on improving your general fitness outside of your classes in order to improve your stamina and sharpness with a sword.

, A big part of fencing, and the best way to test your skills and measure your progress, is by going to official fencing competitions. Before you actually go to compete, you might want to go to a competition as a spectator to get a feel for the event and the atmosphere.


Pay attention to the scoring, and try to learn from what you are watching.

, This cannot be stressed enough! When you go to a competition, you're under pressure to perform well. This pressure can bring out weaknesses in your fencing for you to work on with your coach. Do not, however, go to competitions before your master/coach thinks you are ready. There's a certain level of readiness that you should be at before you throw yourself into an actual tournament.

, Once you have developed your skills and confidence, and your coach has given you the green light, put all your work into practice and go and win some matches. Competitions requires serious mental strength so be sure to keep your cool and respect your opponent and the referee at all times. Dignity and humility in victory and defeat is crucial.

",How to Fence in Close Quarters," Knowing Quince may prove useful, but, given the size of the motion, it is best not applied during an in-fight (given that in-fighting focuses on making the smallest motions possible).;
,, Your partner lunges in the low line, and you parry Octave. You then switch to Octave's cede parry, Seconde and step in. Riposte to the knee in épée, or the flank in foil, depending on the weapon you are using.

, Your partner lunges in the high line, and you counterparry (circular parry) sixte. Then cede to Tierce, step in. Ensure your opponent's point has past your target. For same handed opponents: Keep your shoulder's sided presenting minimum target and drop the weapon hand, caged at the hip. Riposte by dropping the point in a half circular release using the writs and fingers to manipulate your blade.

, Your partner lunges in the low line, and you parry Septime. Cede to Prime as you step in and riposte to the knee in épée, or the stomach/groin in foil. In the cases of Octave-Seconde and Sixte-Tierce, the action was a mere switch from Supination (palm up) or Neutrality to Pronation (palm down), but in Septime-Prime, given the nature of the motion, you may need to lower your Prime, or step in before ceding.

, The cede parry for Quarte is, in fact, Quarte. Perform the drill by parrying Quarte, then switching to complete pronation as you step in.

, Get a wall pad or a pillow, something that you can hit repeatedly without risking damage to it, and tape an X on it. Spend some time each day of practice lunging, extending, jump lunging, advance lunging, step-up lunging (also known as ""gain lunging""), and, for foilist and epeeist, fletching against your target. Keep on going until you hit the center of the X five or six times in a row.

, Point attacks in saber can give you a huge edge over your opponent. When you double-disengage lunge and catch them in the center of the chest, nine times out of ten, they'll give you a look that says ""What in the world was that?"" Note: With the ""new"" timing in electric saber, this action leaves the attacker especially open to a stop-hit to the arm/wrist if performed incorrectly. Against more advanced fencers great care must be taken to ensure that the arm cannot be reached by the opponent until the end of the action during the final acceleration of the point towards target.

, Disengage and counter parry are the cornerstones of any foilists' or epeeists' repertoire. Try to practice with another person, rather than a target. Have them make lateral parries while you try to make the smallest disengages possible, all during a short action, like an advance lunge. Then reverse roles, making them attack you. Make the smallest counter parry you can, and train yourself to an instant riposte. When you disengage be sure to do so from your fingers, do not make the mistake of starting this movement with your shoulder or your arm, this will alter your point control and is improper form. Disengages should always be the smallest possible movement made with your fingers!

, To explain this, we will label our fencers A, B, C, D, E, and F. A starts out in the center, with the rest surrounding him (in alphabetical order). First, B attacks A, who responds by parrying (or attempting to) with a riposte, or counterattacking. Immediately after this, A turns to C, who attacks, with A reacting again. In this way, A goes on turning until he reaches E. After the action between A and E, E and A switch places. The process begins again with A attacking E. In this way, everyone exchanges two actions (one attack and one reaction) with everyone else. If everyone is familiar with the drill, six people can finish in about 1.5 minutes. By doing this drill often, you will increase your reaction speeds, so that in a bout, no attack will catch you flat-footed.

, Many colleges host camps, but there are also major programs in France, Italy, Poland, England - all over Europe really. Inside of the USA, the selection is fair, but you're best off going overseas if you're serious about the sport. If you don't have enough time, or simply don't want to go into a foreign country to train, smaller programs are available all over the planet.

, In the words of Tim Morehouse, ""Footwork is 70% of fencing."" You cannot make your footwork good enough. Do drills, entire bouts even, with a friend, fencing on the edge of the strip. Make sure that you stay on that line. Make advancing and retreating patterns (Advance-Advance-Retreat, Retreat-Retreat-Advance, Advance-Advance-Advance-Retreat-Retreat, etc.) and perform these sequences on the edge of the strip. Ensure that your lunge is straight, again, using the edge of the strip. Practice switching direction. Try advancing full tilt, then switching to retreats. Until you can do this switch (and its reverse), practice it regularly. Avoid leaning and rocking. Leaning forward presents target and keeps you craning your neck to see your opponent, leaning backwards, while it can be used to parry with distance, should be avoided, as it makes it difficult to move, and inhibits your ability to parry. Rocking both presents target, and makes it difficult to parry. When you are advancing and retreating, the only movement should be taking place below your waist. To improve your transition speed while switching from a retreat to an advance or an advance to a retreat, it's important to drop in your legs with the final retreat or final advance. This drops your center of gravity making it easier to overcome your backwards momentum and gets a great deal of compression in the legs which in turn speeds up your motion in the opposite direction.

, Your lunge should come to your opponent as a bolt from the blue. The only real way to achieve this is to continue fencing for a long time, but working on leg strength can improve this somewhat also. Still, you can watch yourself for nasty habits that signal to your opponent that a lunge is coming. 1) Tensing up your back leg. 2) Extending too soon. Make sure your extension comes less than half a second before your lunge (if not at the same time, or delayed with the intent of deceiving a parry). 3) Continued advances at high speed. 4) Moving your blade into a preferred position. Some fencers like to lunge from a certain position. Primarily these are Sixte, and Octave, but starting every lunge in Septime will be a dead giveaway. A useful method for practicing a lunge is using a tennis ball on a hard floor, throwing with your sword hand, bounce the ball out in front of you, for beginners the ball should come up to hand level about 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) in front of you, then lunge and extend your arm to grab the ball with your sword hand, this helps with hand-eye coordination and can help visualize lunging distance, and with a group it's more fun than typical drills. The distance of the bounce can also be increased to practice a flèche.

, This applies primarily to foil. Many beginners will be at a loss for what to do when you simply pull your blade out of the high line. A common trick is to extend, provoking a parry, then, rather than deceiving that parry normally, pulling the blade away. The one who does a parry will sometimes A) Freeze up, giving you a free touche OR B) Extend, which you should be prepared for, parrying and riposting. Other responses, such as distance parrying, will often render this action useless, but if you're prepared to take that parry mid-attack, you're safe.

, 60% of all fencing takes place in the high line. As a result, many fencers have weaker Septime and Octave parries. Getting used to attacking to the low line will only increase your chances of winning.

, Most coaches teach that the blade should be held in the line of Sixte, closing out that side of the fencer entirely. While this is certainly most comfortable for beginners, you shouldn't feel limited to fencing in Sixte. By placing your blade between two lines, while you expose both of them, you also make parrying in either quicker than the parry you originally would have had to make. Note: This only works well against beginning and intermediate fencers. Due to the fact that no line is completely defended, an advanced fencer using a well timed feint disengage or feint 1-2 will have no difficulty deceiving your attempts to parry.

, But do so at your own risk. This only applies to foil and epee. While flicks to the back are now much more difficult and therefore less effective, it is still effective to flick aiming for the flank, shoulder, and chest. This is just another tool that should be at your disposal. In epee, you can use your opponent's bell guard to help make your blade flick down, into their wrist. In the case of foil, because of the lightness of the blade, flicks are considerably easier. Learning how to flick, combined with absence de fer, can win many bouts in foil. The real part of the flick that makes its use advantageous is its ability to evade a parry. While a straight extension merely needs to be gently pressed aside, a flick requires an exaggerated parry that, once deceived, gives you an opening for many different attacks. Note: many coaches despise the flick! Not only is it seen as being illegal (some, though not all, directors will see it as such)it is considered to be a ""cheap shot"". Take care that if you choose to add this move that you find out where your club and coaches stand, as this is controversial subject. Clubs that teach purely classical foil and epee will shun this more than a 2.0 minded salle would.

, When someone beats you consistently, go to them to try to find out what they're catching you on. Sometimes they'll be rude and turn you away, but more often than not they'll tell you (perhaps in incomprehensible language) what's happening. Even just ""I can see when you're going to lunge"" is a huge help. This sort of feedback on your fencing lets you focus on your weaker points.

, You can't always rely on someone else to tell you what you did wrong. Learn to identify errors yourself. Work on improving the problem areas you identify.

, If a coach never sees you fence, how are they supposed to help you improve?

, Learn what they like to do, where they are weak, etc. Use this knowledge to form a strategy to use against them. No two fencers fence the same way, don't expect your opponent to fence like another one.

Your mind needs to not only be aware that you need to prepare to fight, but also to quickly take in your surroundings and calculate how to turn the environment to your advantage. If you are taken by surprise, you may be beaten before you had a chance to draw your sword.

Trust your ""uh-oh"" gut feelings. Having a feeling that something is just not right? That you are being watched? It is just too quiet, or something is out of place, or you hear something but not sure what? Honor your intuition; it may well save your life.
Be aware of threats. If you are not aware of attackers, you are already at a disadvantage. This includes being observant of odd or suspicious behavior, awareness of your surroundings, and often just your ""gut feeling"".
Be aware of your fighting situation. A fight by two thugs in a darkened alley is different from a tournament fight. A tournament fight is controlled and done with a code of honor. If you are attacked ""on the street"" (for some reason) you are likely fighting for your life, and should not hold back on ""dishonorable"" tactics such as kicking, throwing sand in an opponent's eyes, or trickery.;
, Every sword fight takes place somewhere. Awareness of where you are can help access possible disadvantages, and be able to turn the physical environment to your advantage. If you can maneuver yourself so that you can attack and/or protect yourself more effectively--prepare an ambush, force your opponent against a dead end, hide behind a boulder--you are more likely to win. Some sample environmental elements to consider:


Bright sunlight can blind, if it is at the right angle and the right blindness. Forcing your opponent to have the sun in his or her eyes may make it much harder to see you.
Dark environments can conceal, either you or your opponent.
Forests have a host of opportunities for concealment. Trees makes it difficult or impossible to execute massed defenses such as ""shield walls"" or offenses like typical battlefield formations.
Natural barriers such as cliffs, ocean, or walls cut off mobility and escape routes.
Swordfighters (especially in armor) do not typically do well in mud, marshy areas, ice, or deep, soft snow.
Battlefields require acting as part of a team, even more than an as individual. You will depend on the people around your for survival, and to act rashly alone means likely death for you and your comrades.
Urban environments typically encompass enclosed spaces, such as rooms or streets.

, A trained sword swing takes a fraction of a second, so drawing your sword can take precious time. Also, your sword is of minimal value hanging in its sheath.


On the other hand, if your sword and scabbard are suitable for a quick draw, and you practice, this can be a great surprise attack. It can also intimidate by showing you are a highly trained fighter.
This is especially applicable to the Japanese sword which has styles for attacking people while drawing the blade called Iaido and Batto-jutsu.

, The natural reaction to sword combat is panic. However, if you are tight, in a frazzled state of mind you cannot act with speed, control, or mental clarity. This can be fatal. With practice, you will learn to achieve a state of calm concentration in the midst of danger. Your mind will learn to focus on what is., Always have your feet shoulder wide and when you move, move so your legs spread apart. Never have your feet close to each other. Hold your sword so you can handle it with ease. Watch your opponent's movements and learn when he moves in to attack and launch a preemptive strike (counter).Be quick. When you parry you keep the blade close to you so you don't stretch out to block and always try to counter your opponents attack. Your footing and proper foot placement is key for balance. The more of the sole of your foot touches the ground the more grounded you are giving you greater strength in your attacks. To keep your balance try to slide your feet rather then lift them up and stepping. Leaning forward lifting up your heel also reduces your grounding so be cautious with how your feet are placed and used during each strike because you give great opportunity for your opponent to knock you over. Keep your posture straight and your chest and torso forward which will keep you from losing your balance during your swings and allows you to avoid with a simple twist any blows with ease rather then having your torso turned sideways locking yourself to only be able to evade an attack in only one direction.

, If you charge in recklessly, especially against a trained fighter, he may just wait and let you impale yourself on his sword. By engaging carefully, you are able to maintain control and focus at all times. This also will allow your best defense which most of the time is just sidestepping (or side sliding) your opponents attack potentially saving your life and allowing the opening for your winning blow. Dodging works extremely well in an open space or if you are quick, an indoor room.

, Missing just one block or parry can be fatal, so protect yourself well. Maintain your sword in a position that runs from the bottom of your torso to the top of your head. This is a middle position, suitable for any skill level, that will enable you to respond to an attack with reasonable speed, and also gives you many angles for your own strikes.

, Generally, your sword should be extended a comfortable distance away from your body, and toward your opponent's throat, or perhaps his eye. This is referred to as putting him ""on point"". It serves as a ward against an opponent (who must, after all, get through your sword first), and can be quite intimidating, especially to an inexperienced fighter.

, An inexperienced fighter tends to stretch out his arms in order to keep his opponent further off, but this will hurt your ability to thrust and parry quickly. Extend your sword towards your opponent, not your arms.

, Although a skilled fighter can keep up combat for extended periods, a real sword fight is quite often determined by the first blow--often decided in less than 30 seconds. Be sure of your attack, for it is likely that if you miss with your first strike, your opponent will take advantage, and end the fight himself with a fatal blow.

, One's ""reach"" is the weapon plus the length of the sword swing. A long arm with a short sword could equal the reach of a shorter arm and a long sword. What is comfortable will be based on a number of factors: your height, sword length, sword style, and fighting style all affect your proper distance.


If you have a shorter ""reach"", generally get in close and stay within his or her guard. Do not let him or her push you away. An opponent with longer reach will not be as easily able to get a good swing in, and you can usually swing faster than a person with a longer ""reach"".
If you are using a longer sword, keep your distance. A longer sword makes it possible to keep the opponent farther away and thus less likely to make contact.
If about the same, generally stay about where it would only take one large step forward to attack.

, Poise can decide a fight as surely as the sword, and is an effective stratagem. If you are nervous or frightened, your opponent may try to take advantage of your lack of confidence and attempt to goad you into making a fatal mistake. Cool warriors tend to make others wary, unsettled, and ideally fearful.


You can still stay calm, but prefer to show aggressiveness and intimidate your opponent instead, or even pretend to be scared, or even make him or her laugh in the hope of lulling your enemy into making a fatal error.
Each strength has a weakness. For example, a tall fighter may have longer reach--but it may take longer to throw a shot, and height is a disadvantage in an area with a low ceiling height.
Each weakness may have a strength. An inexperienced fighter is also one that is difficult to predict.

, This is just a fancy way of summing everything else in this article up in one sentence but its very important in it's own right too. If you succeed in finding the flow and controlling it you have a very good chance of almost directly influencing the entire fight directly through you actions. It is a difficult concept to grasp but try the next time you spar during practice.


Find the patterns and flow from one move to the next and try to control your opponent. Generally fighters fall into strikes, defenses, and tactics that are most familiar and comfortable to them. It takes many years and lots of practice to accomplish this but if you do this then the battle is already half yours.

, Most sword fights are won with simple, well timed and well placed blows and parries. Flashy elaborate moves are generally best left to martial arts movies. There are practical purposes to certain showy maneuvers in the right situation in the right opportunity. However, unless you are an expert you are more likely to leave yourself open for an embarrassing defeat. For instance, do not spin in a circle. It may look cinema-ready but leaves your hard-to-defend back open to blows.


One possible useful purpose: intimidation. Showing a less experienced fighter that you are able to easily pull off fancy maneuvers can crack the other person's confidence. Making the opponent question his or her abilities against you is a huge psychological win.
Another good tactic: distraction. If your opponent is busy watching you dance around, that might be the time you need to find an opening in the defense.

Join and get started.",How to Choose a Martial Art," Most often, people take up a martial art for self-defense purposes. Daniel LaRusso did so. He was being bullied. Are you being bullied? Or are you afraid of being harassed in the future? Every single martial art will teach you how to defend yourself. Your goal will be to find a martial art that emphasizes defense techniques and breaking holds.In many ways, Jiu Jitsu is this martial art, because it uses the opponent's strength and force of attack as a weapon against him, thus enabling a stronger or bigger attacker to be subdued.









When in a self-defense situation, Jiu Jitsu will help you dodge frontal attacks, escape from holds, and get the upper hand quickly. Remember that every martial arts form addresses self-defense. Some are more confrontational than others. Jiu Jitsu is a happy medium.;
, The second most popular reason why people practice martial arts is to exercise, to transform fat into muscle, and to increase their coordination. All martial arts do this well, but depending on your own fitness goals, you might choose one martial art over another. Kung Fu is a great all around body workout. Since Kung Fu utilizes low stances and powerful blocks, it tends to provide a full body workout. This is also one of the most disciplined forms of martial arts.








While Kung Fu works all of your muscles, there are martial art styles that emphasize upper body or lower body strength and flexibility. If you’d rather work on your upper body strength, you might choose the Western Boxing style or perhaps Shotokan Karate from Japan. Alternatively, if you want your legs to be in better shape, you might choose a martial arts style with a greater emphasis on leg strength and agility like Taekwondo., Naginata today is a martial art and an art form that teaches etiquette, respect, and self-confidence. Martial arts like Naginata build confidence because they unlock potential, build muscle, and teach you new skills. Many people who first enter the dojo suffer from low self esteem or simply don’t believe in themselves. Maybe that’s why you’ve chosen to consider martial arts for yourself. If so, you’ll want to find a program and a teacher that will build you up rather than tear you down.Naginata instructors focus on encouraging positive feelings and experiences. Positive reinforcement will be a key aspect of your decision making process., Taekwondo is the world's most popular martial art. This probably owes much to its addition to the Olympics in 1988. Many consider Taekwondo to be an artistic form and as such you must have great self control. You must discipline yourself to make every movement fluid, graceful, and deliberate. Because so much emphasis is placed on movement and form, many find Taekwondo to be a great way of teaching discipline and self-control (to children or anyone).








Martial arts are regimented and hierarchical experiences and as such demand a high level of discipline and self-control in order to succeed. During your training, you may encounter instruction that runs counter to your preconceived notions. “Wax on, wax off,” Mr. Miyagi told Daniel in The Karate Kid. Daniel was confused because he couldn’t comprehend how waxing a car could possibly relate to learning martial arts. Only later did he discover that the teacher knew better. Follow your teacher as best as you can. Listen to his instructions. Practice frequently. While this discipline will help you become a better martial artist, it will also transfer to your everyday life., In the 1970s, American karate martial artists became frustrated with the strict guidelines placed on competitions. They wanted to make full-contact. This faction splintered off and created kickboxing. Competitors use sparring, kicks, punches, blocks, and shadow boxing to prepare for matches. Because its origins lie within full contact and competition, kickboxing makes for a great martial arts form for those interested in getting in the ring.








Some martial arts don’t emphasize ring fighting. Traditional styles of Kung Fu such as Wing Chun or Hung Gar are not designed to teach you to fight in the ring. You can and will learn exceptional self defense in these systems, but it will take a good long while before your basics are solid enough to have any impact in a combative situation.

, If you have a respect for or interest in a certain culture, learning more through one of their martial arts can be a great experience. Study Krav Maga if you're interested in Israel. Study Taekwondo if you're curious about Korean culture. Try Sumo to get a better understanding of Japanese culture.


If that is part of your goal, choose a school taught by a native of that culture, or someone who trained directly under someone of that culture. The instruction will feel more “authentic” and you wil most certainly pick up other aspects of their culture in the process — like language, mannerisms, history, and philosophy., In most cases, you’ll probably land on a form of martial arts based on what is available in your area. If it is difficult or time consuming to get to your dojo, you'll just have one more excuse to not follow through. Search online and in the phone book for martial arts studios.

, Rarely do martial arts schools advertise their price of instruction in the phone book. Prices could be determined on a monthly basis, over several months, or by how often you train each week. In some cases, the price is negotiable depending on how many people will be taking classes with you (family package deals, for example). There are instructors who charge as little as $50 a month for instruction, and there are those who garner $50 or more for a single one-hour session. It is up to you to determine what you feel is a fair and manageable price for instruction. After some research, you will know who is asking too much.


Another good way to save money is to look for classes that do not operate out of a storefront. There are many successful schools that operate in community centers, church basements, YMCA's and recreation halls. Just because a school does not have a fancy storefront does not mean the quality of instruction is inferior.Call and inquire about trial periods, attire required, and membership/class fees. Look out for hidden fees. Some places charge more per class after you've attended a certain number of them. , A great way to get a feel for a martial arts style and a particular school/instructor is to attend a couple of classes before settling on a specific place and style. You’ll get a chance to see the space, meet with other practitioners, and visit the instructor.


Talk to the other students. See what they like about the program and what they dislike. Some of the more tenured martial artists in attendance may even have experience about other programs, which will help you narrow down your decision.

, If you are looking to learn practical martial arts, does the class encourage or allow beginners to get involved in sparring or ""free-play"" or is this reserved for more advanced students who have spent more time and money at the dojo? Do you want a trainer — someone who will motivate you to push? Do you want someone who will build your self-esteem? Do you want to work one-on-one or in a large class? A Martial Arts instructor’s teaching style will differ based on your goals and the setting you are in.Realize also that beginner sparring, even if encouraged, should be more restricted than the more experienced students because beginners do not usually have sufficient control of their strikes to effectively reduce the chance of injury.

, Take note of the students at your school and the way they interact with each other and their seniors. Are they friendly and receptive? Are they respectful? Would you consider them to be friends? You're going to be spending significant amounts of time with them, so it is important to understand their personality, as well. You'll also be putting your safety in their hands; if that makes you uncomfortable, keep looking., Don't worry so much about degrees and certificates; there are no universal grading standards and no universally-recognized governing body in martial arts. What's important is:


Who did this person learn from?
How long did he or she study with this person?
How long has he/she practiced this art?
Does the teacher have any experience as a teacher, or is he or she simply a skilled martial artist? Just like great football players can make bad coaches (and vice versa), great martial artists are not necessarily great teachers.
Be aware when looking at your local schools that many teachers will tell you that their school/system is the best. There are many martial artists that are very loyal to their arts and will be negative if you express interest in another art. Be careful if this happens; they probably are not the best instructors if they do not show respect for others in this way., You may need to set aside a significant amount of time each week to dedicate to your training. Most arts have exercises or forms you can practice at home to keep it all fresh in your mind; if you only practice at class, your progress will probably be stunted.Make sure that you dedicate enough time to attend classes and practice at home. Remember, martial arts are about discipline. Don't enter into a program without accepting this. Otherwise, you won't follow through with the program.

, Now is usually better than later. Jump right in and get started. You’ve done your due diligence. You’ve decided on one particular form of marital arts over another. You know what to expect. Have fun!

Understand the fencing rules.,
Dress for safety.,
Equip yourself according to the weapon that you fence.,

Wear a plastic chest protector.,
Put on a plastron (underarm protector).,
Put on a jacket with a strap which goes between the legs.,
Don’t forget about the body cord.,
If you fence foil or Sabre, wear a lamé.,
Wear a mask with the bib and back strap.",How to Dress for Fencing," Fencing is governed by Federation International d’Escrime (FIE). Thus, all equipment should meet the FIE’s standards. Make sure your equipment is legal and follows all of the guidelines.
, The safety measures specified the fencing rules are designed to increase the fencers’ safety. In short, FIE rules state that the tournament outfits must be made of fabric that resists a certain amount of force. The preceding table shows the minimum safety standards for clothing.,

Foil is a light thrusting weapon. It has a small circular hand guard which protects the hand.
Épée is a thrusting weapon (heavier than the foil). It has a large circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from touches.
Sabre is a light cutting and thrusting weapon. The Sabre hand guard is specific because it is turned outwards, and connects the pommel with the base. It also aims at protecting the arm from touches.

, Most fencing clubs will tell you what uniform to buy. Be sure to buy equipment that is safe, comfortable, and functional and to shop only from professional stores. Remember that although the traditional fencing uniform is white, the FIE also allows other colors (except for black)., The inner layer of clothes gives an additional comfort during bouts., They cover and protect the knees from the strong touches., Usually, these are equipped with suspenders. Along with socks, it protects the legs from touches. The brace prevents the breeches from shifting around., They should be reinforced on the inside of the back foot and heel of the front foot in order to decrease the wear from lunging., It protects your chest from the painful touches., This is extremely important for your safety, as it protects the arm and its side doubly., The folded fabric, sewn in around the collar, will protect your neck from fencing stabs., It must be attached to the weapon and scoring box to register the touches. It must run inside the weapon arm's sleeve, and then down the back. If you fence Sabre or foil, connect the body cord to the lamé to create a circuit to the scoring box., Wear it over the jacket to cover the on-target area. It serves to distinguish valid hits from those that are invalid. In épée, the entire body is a target, so a lamé is unnecessary.

Please note that the foil and saber lamés are different. A foil lamé is sleeveless, while a sabre lamé has sleeves and ends across the waist.

, The bib protects the neck. The back strap holds the mask stable. Keep in mind that there are different masks for foil, épée, and saber.

Wear one glove with a gauntlet for the weapon arm. It protects the hand and provides a good grip.

It’s also helpful to consider your experience and fitness level so you can find a school that meets your needs.For example, if you are a 40 year old with a full time job, you won’t want to go to a school that is only open during working hours and caters their classes to children.
Reasons people decide to take up martial arts include self-defense, improving fitness level, creative expression, training for instructor certification and many others. You want to find a school that can help you achieve your personal goals with martial arts.;
, If you are interested in a particular style, like Taekwondo or Karate, be sure to seek out schools that specialize in that style. However, if you don’t have a preference, keep an open mind and pick a school based on their teaching instruction rather than a certain style.Some styles of martial arts may be difficult for people with health risks. For example, if you have a heart condition and can’t over exert, you may want to skip high cardio and intense styles like Taekwondo.

, Ask your friends, family and social networks if they have any experience with martial arts schools in your area. It’s great to hear a firsthand account from someone you trust and someone you can ask questions of. Getting a personal recommendation is a great way to find a good martial arts school.

, Search online for martial arts schools in your area. Go through the schools’ websites to learn more about them and get a feel for their programming. You should also look at reviews and testimonials to get firsthand accounts.Remember that many schools will only publish positive testimonials on their website so take those accounts with a grain of salt.
Try to find third-party platforms, message boards or online communities where users have left reviews for the school. This is a great way to read personal accounts and get more information.

, Using the recommendations for schools from your friends and family as well as your online research, compile a list of three to five schools that you are interested in visiting.

, Call the schools you want to visit and set up a good time to come by. Most schools offer a free or reduced cost trial class for new students to try out their school. Sign up for a trial class if one is available. You should also ask to set up a time before or after your trial class to meet with the martial arts instructor., For each trial class you attend, arrive approximately 15 minutes early. For practical reasons, you may need to get changed or sign paperwork before participating in the class. Arriving early also allows you to evaluate the school area.


During your evaluation, look to see if the school facilities are clean, if the staff is professional and service-oriented, and if the location is accessible. You want to make sure that this is a place you are able to get to easily and feel comfortable in.If you arrive early, you may also get to take a sneak peak at a class in progress to get a better sense of the teaching method.

, Check out the hours the school is open, the availability of classes you would want to take and the class size. The school needs to work with your schedule or else you won’t attend regularly., When participating in a trial class, you should assess the instructor and his or her teaching style. Ask yourself: do you feel comfortable in the class? Is the instructor someone you could learn from? Will this class and instructor help you meet your goals?


It’s also a good idea to observe the students in your trial class. If possible, talk to them and ask about their experience with the school and instructor.

, Arrange a time to meet with the instructor one on one. Use this time to discuss your goals for your martial arts training and see if the instructor thinks they can help you achieve them. This is also a good time to ask any questions you have about the school, the training style and the instructor.


Some great questions to ask include, ""How long have you been teaching for? What do you do if a student isn't understanding something? What does a typical class with you look like?""
Be sure to meet with the instructor who will be leading your class. It’s important to meet and get a feel for the teaching style of the person who would be your instructor at the school, not another instructor or the school's owner., Once you’ve completed all of your school visits and trial classes, it’s time to go over everything you’ve learnt and decide which school is the best fit. Consider your goals, the teaching style and the logistics of the classes. At the end of the day, it’s important to trust your gut and pick a school where you feel comfortable., If you’re ready to sign up with a school, take some time to sit down with them and discuss payment options. Some schools require you have a membership to their school while others may ask you to sign a contract for a specified amount of time. Ensure you are comfortable with the financial burden of signing up.Many schools will offer a shorter contract or longer trial period. If you’re not ready to commit to an annual membership or contract, enquire about signing up for a shorter amount of time to try out the school first.
Ask about ending the contract or membership early. In case something happens that causes you to need to put your martial arts training on hold, such as an injury or loss of job, ask how that would work.

, Once you’ve made the decision to sign up, it’s time to get ready for your first class. Ask the school if you need to come prepared with a uniform or any specific equipment or supplies. You should bring a bottle of water, towel and change of clothing.


If your school doesn’t require a uniform, it’s a good idea to wear loose fitting workout clothing. Most martial arts are practised in barefoot but ask your school if you need to bring special footwear.

, After your first class or two, take some time to reflect and decide if the class is what you expected and if you're enjoying yourself. If the class turns out to not be what you're looking for, meet with your instructor to try and find a solution.

Choose your board wisely.,

Strike through the target.,
Concentrate on speed, not power.,
Yell.,

Follow through.,
If you do prepare mentally, and commit your strike fully, you will succeed.",How to Break Boards with Your Bare Hands," Most schools use soft white pine, 6"" x 9"" x 1""; cut these from 9"" by 1"" planks available at any lumberyard. Look for a board that is dry and well seasoned. Sappy, heavy wood is much harder to break. You can also buy specialist re-breakable boards at some Martial Arts shops. These are slightly different, and more expensive, but if you wish to practice a lot they are a good investment.;
, Advanced martial artists can strike a loose or flying board so fast that it breaks before it has time to move; but as a beginner, you want a stationary target. The best way is to recruit a human who is at least your strength and weight, and have him or her hold it where you can strike.

, This angle and position makes it easiest to put your body-weight into the motion. Hit the board straight on with the heel of your hand.

, if you hit it sideways, injury is exponentially more likely than success

, Relax. Don't think about success or failure. Take a calming breath. Focus yourself first. Unless you are extremely weak or sick (in which case you shouldn't be breaking boards at all), mental preparation is the most important aspect of the technique.

, Breaking effectively is less about the amount of force you apply than about putting all that force at the single point of your choice.

, Don't aim at the board itself; if you do that, your hand will tend to stop there. Aim your strike six inches beyond the board.

, You're not trying to push the board away, you're trying to hit it as fast as possible.

, The kiai that martial artists often emit when striking is not just for show, nor to startle the opponent. The contraction of the diaphragm and torso muscles can be used to put more power in your strike.

, Commit your strike. Don't hesitate, don't think, just do it.

, Don't try to stop your hand after the break; relax and let the motion end on its own. If you try to over-control, you will tense up and rob yourself of power. Mental knowledge is the key to a successful break.

, Even prepubescent children have the physical capacity to break boards; for any adult in reasonable health, all the obstacles are mental.

If you do not have good training partners and a good coach, then you won't get very far in this sport. Find a coach and team that have produced the results you are looking for in your own training and stick with them.


When looking for the right gym, you need to meet people that train there. Watch a practice and learn whether or not you gel.Sit with coaches, talk about the goals you have as a fighter, and learn whether or not the gym is the place you want to call your home.;
, The strength of a gym has an inverse relationship to deficiencies you have as a fighter. Unless you’re training at a gym that offers you the opportunity to address weaknesses and round yourself out as a better fighter.For example, if you’re from a Muay Thai background, you might want to train somewhere that helps you with wrestling to make you a better MMA fighter all around.
Becoming as varied as possible in your skill set as a fighter will help you become the best. A gym that teaches you a combination of boxing and jiu jitsu is a great starting point.Assess the size of the guys that train at the gym you’re looking into. If you look at them and feel you need bigger guys to fight, choose a gym that addresses that need. Fighting bigger guys is crucial to giving you the best idea of what it’ll be like to fight someone in a cage match.

, Make sure that there is a line between training and hurting yourself and/or others. Be sure that the coach keeps an eye on how everyone is relating to everyone else.


The environment should facilitate one where everyone is going 110% at any given time during sparring opportunities.
The environment should also be one where everyone cares about each other so that no one is ever seriously hurt. Training is preparation, not actual MMA fighting matches.

, If you want to become a MMA champion, but you don't live near excellent gyms, you might have to sacrifice being close to home. If it means being an area where gyms are of a high level of quantity and quality, then move.If you live in a place with just one martial arts gym, wrestling, Jiu Jitsu, kickboxing, and so on will need to be housed by that one gym. If the gym doesn't offer the training you need to become a champion, consider moving.
If you relocate a to bigger city like Las Vegas or Los Angeles, you'll likely have access to ten quality gyms within a five mile radius. You can go to different gyms to practice different disciplines.

, Stand-up fighting consists primarily of kneeing, elbowing, punching, and kicking. Train to develop footwork so that you can dodge opponent’s attacks more easily in the cage.You will train in a variety of disciplines: karate, Kung-Fu, Kendo, Muay Thai, and of course, boxing.
To learn the fundamental actions most amateur fighters will need, consider gaining an extensive knowledge of kickboxing. It is the most effective way to develop stand-up fighting., Get into a fighting stance. Use one arm to protect your face. Keep the other arm lower to protect your body.On the same side of your body as your lead foot, make a jab with that arm by doing a straight punch.
With your rear hand, make a cross punch by punching straight into the air.
Throw a punch in a circular motion with your lead hand to make a hook shoot.
For an uppercut, punch upward with your fist pointed up.

, This can be done by learning the MMA fighter basics of clinch fighting. Train for the clinch takedown by becoming well-versed in sambo, judo, and wrestling techniques.Learn how to wrestle in order to gain an effective understanding of how to do clinch fighting.Initiate a clinch while you’re standing up or while you’re on the ground.
Get close to your opponent and tie him or her up by locking arms with them.
Take down your opponent by using a throw or a takedown.

, Ground game is another integral part of MMA fighting basics. Ground game is where submissions from your opponent take place.Ground game consists of jiu jitsu, sambo, judo, and shoot and catch wrestling. Knowing how to defend yourself against submission is crucial to winning fights, especially in MMA.
Most MMA fighters train in the Brazilian art of jiu jitsu, so be prepared and train well to be able to defend yourself against their submissions, as well as learning to create your own submissions during fights.
Submit your opponent into a mounted position by getting on top of him or her for optimal control. Mount positions can also be successful from the back and side., For continued fighting power, lift weights for strength and perform fitness drills for endurance. Solid fitness training will ensure that you are able to maintain stamina during a fight.Start your pre-fight training regimen months before a fight. Training needs to be challenge you every way humanly possible to ensure that you’re prepped for anything.Lift weights to maximize your strength. Build endurance for fighting power by doing various fitness drills.

, Raise your heart rate by beginning your routine by sprinting. Sprint for 25 meters (82 ft), walk back to where you started, and then repeat the sprint again for at least five more minutes., Do 15 pushups, 15 jumping jacks, and 15 bench dips. Repeat this routine for a full 5 minutes and then rest for 90 seconds before going to the next step.Perform workouts at least 3 times a week with a day of rest in between.Be sure to record how long it takes you to perform each station of exercises to see how you can improve your time with practice.

, This will help your body build a resistance to fatigue while enduring extreme levels of exertion. Start with 10 heavy bag burpees.Lighten things up by performing a burpee clean and press with 25 lb dumbbells 10 times.
Follow up with doing 10 burpees with 15 lb dumbbells.
Decrease the amount of weights even further by performing the last set of burpees in the station just using your bodyweight. Perform 10 burpees.
Repeat this circuit station for a full five minutes following the end of the workout. Then proceed to the next step.

, Keep the heart elevated while you perform high-intensity conditioning. Perform this circuit and then repeat it for a full five minutes like you did the others before moving to the next step.Kick your legs up into high gear with a set of fast high knees. Do this 10 times.
Perform a set of mountain climbers. Perform the action 10 times.
Do a set of jumping jacks, plank jacks, and split lungs. Each set needs to be done 10 times to be considered a full circuit.

, Build power and strength while continuously building endurance. Incorporate full body weighted resistance to do so.Complete this circuit by doing 10 squats, 10 squats with overhead presses, 10 tricep presses, shoulder circles 10 times in each direction, 10 bicep curls, and 10 bent over rows.
After completion, repeat the station for an additional full five minutes.

, Think of all the MMA greats. Men like Randy Couture, Matt Hughes, Dan Hardy, and Georges St. Pierre. What do they all have in common? Be consistent with how you train and keep your eye on the prize with your goals to be the best.


Have tunnel vision when it comes to others and their progress. By comparing yourself to someone else, you are imposing limits on you. Focus on not having limits at all.Strive for excellence. Focus on your development and growth as an MMA fighter. Search there for your drive to succeed.
Set goals to challenge yourself. Evaluate your progress regularly and then make new goals.

, You can practice and train all day every day, but there’s nothing like real ring experience. When you are ready, go ahead and step into the ring, and let the experience teach you.

, Consider the fighters promoters love to promote. Identify and study what makes fans prefer one fighter over the next. If you become the one that everyone is talking about, then you will have an easier time getting that shot at the title.


Always try to finish your opponent when you’re in the cage. Exciting knockouts and submissions are a lot more fun to watch than decisions.
Show your personality. If you have a great, memorable personality then you will get a lot more exposure.

, Whenever you are training, never miss an opportunity to practice techniques you are taught from different disciplines. No matter where you are or what you're doing, the motions of martial arts can be utilized. Take these opportunities to perfect your techniques.


For example, if you are doing bag drills, don't just swing like a maniac. Use your techniques, like different kickboxing, MMA moves.
If you can keep good form when your arms are ready to drop off, then you have a much better chance of performing at the top of your game when you're in the cage.

, Your body will need time to rest and recover. If you choose to push yourself beyond that point, then it will adversely affect your performance. Learn to recognize this point and when you get to it, give your body the recovery time it needs.


Signs and symptoms that you might have overtrained in the past include being sick before competition, training injuries, underperformance, and/or delayed peaking.Signs and symptoms that you might be overtraining in the present include having an increased heartrate, having an increased heartrate for a given training intensity, having an increased time for heartrate to recover between intervals, and/or apathy or lack of enthusiasm for training.

Locate all the schools in your area.,
Take a look at their website if they have one.,
Make a list of questions that you want to ask the instructor.,
Ask to observe a class and to take a trial class.,
Observe how that instructor interacts with the children in a group and your child on an individual basis.

,
Judge the instructor by the difference in ability between the different students.,
Ask about their ranking system and how frequently they test.,
Take a look around the school and check to see if it is clean.,
Ask about all the pricing programs that they have available to you.",How to Choose a Martial Arts School for Your Child," Sometimes it is well worth it to drive a little bit further if the school is a great fit for you and your child.;
, The quality of their websites will give you an idea of the type of school that you will be visiting. There should be information about the instructor or instructors, styles, and class schedules. If you don't find any of this information on their website, then it would be a good idea to call and ask for this information before you go and visit the school

, The website should tell you about the instructor, but it would be a good idea to ask them in person so you get an idea of who that person is. Ask what their teaching method is and what they are trying to accomplish. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everyone has certain values that they hold dear and it will be an important part of your child's development to make sure that those values are consistent or left undisturbed.

, Most schools offer some sort of free trial whether it be a single class or several classes. It will give you an opportunity to see how the classes are run.

,, The higher ranking students should look more impressive compared to the lower ranking students. The instructor should look and be more impressive than any of their students. Your child will only grow as much as the instructor's knowledge to teach. That instructor should impress you. Remember that the martial arts involve skill and experience. Both are required to teach.

, If there are more than 10 ranks from white belt to black belt (or whatever system or ranking that they use from start to top rank), then be careful. That system may be designed to make money rather than teach good martial arts. Also be careful if there are sub-ranks or testing for stripes. If a school is testing your child every two weeks to a month, and there are sub-ranks, then it might be trying to make money off of frequent testing rather than judging based on ability. Schools with anywhere from 6 to 10 ranks will generally be more involved with your child's goals and achievements.

, The cleanliness of the school is a reflection of the effort that the instructors put into their students. It's also a sanitation issue because your child will be rolling around on the ground doing exercises.

, Some schools will tell you that you have options, but those options may be more beneficial to them than to you.

Don't ever give too much away.,
Practice being quiet, in all different kinds of situations, hard and easy.,
Stealth isn't being good at hide and seek.,
Be creative in your sneaking, use concealment to cover from the line of sight of other people, use camouflage to blend in with your surroundings so you can lie in plain sight and not be spotted and lastly use your senses.,Learn to creep, this is when you crawl use your feet and hands, but keep your body off the ground

",How to Be a Master of Stealth," You might be thinking that creeping around and being secretive is all there is to be stealthy, but there are quite a lot of other things to it. For example, if you never give too much away, you decrease the risk of anybody finding out any of your plans or surprising you. So when you're talking to somebody, don't talk too much about anything that you want to be kept quite low key. If you do happen to tell someone something, make sure they're the kind of person you can trust.;
, Try sneaking up and surprising your little sister while she's watching TV, try walking in a corridor without making any sound at all, try standing still and just being as silent as you can. Learn to walk softly and evenly, and to keep your breathing quiet, not panting all over the place. It may take some practice if you're clumsy and noisy, but this is something that anybody can learn if they try hard enough.

, Stealth is being able to move from location to location undetected, but this doesn't mean that if you've been in the same place 20 seconds you need to sprint out into the open. Stealth is where subjects in the area are unaware that you are anywhere near the location, having someone know you are hiding somewhere and is looking for you is not the same thing, though this is seen as part of the skill of mastering stealth as if detected should be able to slip away seamlessly.

, Be careful what you're standing on and how much noise it makes. Be careful about how you smell; are you using too much deodorant? Does it smell unnatural? Be careful of what you do. Move in time to the wind and other repetitive noises and lastly be patient it may take hours to move only a few hundred meters, but make a mistake and you could end up a lot worse than just bored out your brains.

Train regularly in the martial arts.,
Find a tournament that suits you.,
Another important thing to consider is the size of the tournament and the rules the tournament follows.,
Decide which events you will compete in.,
Be prepared on the day of the tournament.,
Once you arrive, make sure you take the time to register or pick up your pre-registration and make sure you are registered in all the correct divisions.,
Be alert!,
Musical Creative/Extreme Weapons or Forms.,
Traditional Weapons Forms.,
Traditional Forms.,
Sparring.",How to Compete and Succeed in Martial Arts Tournaments," If you don't know any martial arts, you certainly can't compete in a martial arts tournament! Train at least twice a week when preparing for a tournament, as well as few times a week at home so you can achieve a skill level that allows you to compete and do well when pitted against others. Stances, technique, kiai and balance are all important aspects to work on. Private lessons, if offered at your dojo, may be beneficial. If you are an XMA artist or do creative/musical martial arts, be sure to work on being able to keep to your music, land all your stunts and keep your weapons in your hands at all times. Also, if your dojo has a competition team that travels on tournament circuits and practices specifically for tournaments, this may be something you want to look into.

, There are tons of tournaments out there, so you need to narrow down your search a bit. What kind of martial arts do you do? Some are open tournaments, which allow all forms of martial arts as well as XMA (extreme martial arts) to compete, in separate divisions for each event (see below). There are tournaments specifically for grappling or sparring enthusiasts, and tournaments for one style of martial arts only (eg. a kung fu tournament vs. an open martial arts tournament).

, If you are just starting off in tournaments, a smaller one or one recommended by your club may be less daunting than a large international tournament that involves travelling a long way from home and staying in an expensive hotel. Typically, a tournament is hosted by a club around the area in which that particular dojo is located. The tournament may be part of a martial arts tournament circuit, in which case point ratings may be awarded for circuit regulars/members and the tournament will likely follow one set of rules and divisions shared by many different events. Rules are a very important thing to read when filling out registration, especially for sparring or XMA competitors. continue reading for more detail on this.

, All the events available at most tournaments will be discussed in detail below, but if you do not practice one of the events, obviously don't sign up for it. Typically, most people compete in forms/kata, sparring, and possibly weapons.

, Be sure you have your full uniform and belt/sash, all the sparring equipment required, and plenty of snacks and water before you leave home. Most tournaments provide some kind of lunch for sale, so you may bring money to purchase it or pack your own. You should have some kind of duffel bag or backpack to carry all your things, and this should be clearly labelled with a marker or luggage tag. If you bring weapons, be sure you can clearly identify them as your own (recommend you write your name on them in permanent marker on one end). Check Mapquest to make sure you have directions to the venue and leave a bit early.

, Mistakes do happen. You may want to bring a plastic card holder lanyard that can go around your neck and underneath your uniform to hold your division cards. Make sure you stretch properly and warm up before competing at all, to avoid injury. Because there are often breaks between divisions, you may want to repeat this before each division.

, Make sure any space you use to practice or warm up is not needed for a ring or spectators. Sometimes you may be asked to leave the tournament floor if you are not competing. If the rings and divisions are being called on the loudspeakers, be sure to listen for them and head to the correct ring promptly when called. You will usually be disqualified if you are late to enter your card. If you are at a large tournament like NASKA, you may be responsible for finding your own ring using a ring assignment chart. Be sure to figure this out right away and hang around near the ring until your division is called so you don't miss it.

, Usually the first event of the day, so be there bright and early to warm up sufficiently! Stretch well, be sure to warm up with your weapons to get the feel of them before you go up, and make sure your uniform will not catch the weapons or interfere with your routine in any way. Have your music on an otherwise blank CD to avoid the wrong music playing in your routine. A sound system may or may not be provided to you, so it's good practice to bring a loud, battery-powered stereo of your own if you can. If you have acrobatics in your routine, this is the time to use them. Warm up your stunts beforehand, but don't practice too much - you may hurt yourself before the division even starts! If you keep dropping your weapon or can't land stunts in the practice/warm up, don't let that make you nervous. Nerves can kill your routine!


Once you get up to compete, make sure you are LOUD! Unlike other divisions, you can yell and scream all you want in this division. If your music does not include time for you to make your judges introduction, raise your right hand high enough for the stereo operator to see when you want it to come on. Don't over-think your routine or watch anything/anyone but yourself. If you've practiced enough and are keeping to your music, you will be fine! Your competition time usually consists of bowing to enter the ring, an introduction to the judges, your form, and a pause at the end in which you receive your scores before exiting the ring. Sometimes, to speed things up, a tournament may tell you to skip the judges intro for this division. If so, be sure you have music prepared beforehand that is shortened accordingly. You will be given a number score by 3 or 5 judges and the highest total score wins.;
, This event usually follows creative events. Your competition time will consist of bowing into the ring, a judges presentation, the performance of your form, a pause for scoring, and bowing out. Again, sufficient warm-up is important. Be sure you've warmed up with your weapon(s) and that nothing will catch on your uniform. Right before going up to perform, you may want to wipe the palms of your hands on your gi to avoid sweaty palms and slipping weapons! This division is NOT the time to be performing any routine that you made up, or any form with throws/catches, creative movements, or acrobatics. This is a traditional division for traditional martial arts forms. Be sure to keep your technique clean, your stances low, and to use loud breathing and kiai. If you have any kicks or balance moves in your kata, be sure to chamber and make sure they are not sloppy. You will be given a number score by 3 or 5 judges, the person with the highest total score wins. BTW, if your dojo uses a separate belt system in weapons, do NOT switch to a weapons belt. Use your regular belt.

, This is usually the largest division at a tournament. Your competition time basically consists of bowing into the ring, a judges presentation, the performance of your form, a pause for scores, and bowing out. Once again, the task of warming up, especially your arms and legs, is paramount. Don't be nervous when going in, just be sure to keep your technique really clean and your stances very low. Intense facial expression is helpful, as is balance and use of your body/uniform to create sound. You may want to SLIGHTLY modify from your original, adding more pauses/kiais and snaps of the head. However, this is a TRADITIONAL form division, so don't perform any stunts, acrobatics or creative moves. As with the other divisions, your score is a numerical score from 3 or 5 judges and the person with the highest total score wins. If there is a tie, you will perform either the same form again or a lower form, and judges will either re-score or decide the winner with a show of hands. Don't ever attempt to perform a form you haven't practiced or don't know well.

, The most anticipated division of the day, and usually the most fun! Before fighting, make sure you are wearing all the proper protection required by the tournament. Pretty much every tournament will require at least a mouth-guard and some kind of hand protection, and also may require any of the following: groin protection, foot pads, headgear, shin pads, a chest-guard, or full face mask. If you don't have any of this equipment, borrow from a friend - but make sure it fits properly!


The sparring rules are the greatest variable between different tournaments. Some tournaments are very strict on contact, even not allowing you to touch each other at all. Light touch tournaments let you hit each other but with controlled contact, and full-contact tournaments let you hit as hard as you can (these often require the most protective gear). Be VERY well aware of these rules before beginning the fight.
You score points by hitting to a target area. There will be one centre judge and two other corner judges watching your fight. If they see a point, they will call for you to stop fighting and will award a point by show of hands. There will always be an odd number of judges so no arguments over who saw what point should occur. Target areas are generally the stomach/torso, kidneys, and side/top of the head, but vary from tournament to tournament. Again, be aware of rules before beginning. Some tournaments require you to be the first to score 3, 5 or 7 points on the other person. Others give you 2 minutes to score as many points as you can, the winner being the one with most points after this time runs out. The division runs in round-robin style, so if you win you will advance to fight the next person until only 2 are left to decide 1st and 2nd places.
Warming up and working on cardio are probably the most important. Be sure to practice blocking and scoring combinations at your dojo or on a punching bag beforehand. Don't let your opponent intimidate you; simply look for openings, block their combos, and do what you were trained to do. If you or your opponent injures each other or hits in an illegal area, contact will be called. This can mean the awarding of points to the opponent or disqualification in serious cases. Be nice to your judges and be sure to respect their decisions - they are black belt/sash judges for a reason.

Becoming more flexible will make you better at capoeira and improve your kicks, dodges, and strikes. Stretch regularly and don’t focus on just one limb or muscle group.Spend about ten minutes warming up before and after your capoeira training sessions.


Do a warm-up stretch and, when you’re done for the day, do a cool-down stretch.;
, Roll your neck, head and shoulders. Move your head from side to side ten times, up and down ten times, and around in a clockwise, then a counterclockwise circle. Do ten rolls of each, both backwards and forwards. Without bending your knees, reach for your toes. Hold the position for ten seconds. Roll your wrists in both directions and flex your hands forward and backwards at least ten times on each hand.

, Hold that position for ten seconds, then switch to your other leg. Alternate in this way for ten reps. Do lunges (putting one foot out in front of you and bending it at the knee) for ten reps as well. Finish your leg stretching session with leg swings. Lean against a wall with one hand, and with your leg on the opposite side, move it in and out from your body in both lateral and forward /backward motions.

, Do some push-ups and arm rolls (extending your arms out at your side and moving them in wide circles). Roll your arms backwards and forwards for a count of ten seconds. Alternate in this way for at least one minute. Interlock your fingers and push them high over and behind your head as far as they will go. Keeping your fingers interlaced, bend at the waist and bring them down to the floor., In more prosaic terms, no pain, no gain. If you believe you cannot do a particular exercise or movement, you might be right, but try it at least once.Pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone will help you grow stronger and more flexible.

, Simple curls with a dumbbell will help you get stronger. Try to do a set of 14 to 22 curls with a given dumbbell weight. You should, by the end of the set, feel a moderate strain in your arm.If your curl was too easy and you aren’t “feeling the burn” in your arm after your last curl, move up to a higher dumbbell weight. Add weight in five-pound increments progressively as you grow stronger.


While dumbbells are the most affordable weight-training investment, you could also invest in a bench press (or just get a gym membership). A bench press is a long, padded adjustable surface on which a weightlifter lies and lifts a barbell. Weightlifting with a bench press will give you the chance to lift heavier loads and involve more muscles at one time than you could with dumbbells.
Instead of, or in addition to, lifting weights, work out on a pull-up bar. Aim to do at least five pull-ups when you start out. As you grow stronger, try to add one pull-up to your routine each week until you reach your maximum.

, Have a partner come at you with foam sticks. Try to deflect or avoid their blows. Similarly, get your partner to do pad work with you. Pad work is common in boxing and involves a partner slipping large, flat pads over his or her hands, then swinging or moving them close to your body and head so that you can strike. To strike the pad properly, you’ll have to be fast and adapt quickly to your partner’s random movements.There are several reflex-building training exercises which you can do alone. Punching a double end punching bag or an elastic head ball causes them to bounce back and forth. Working with one demands that you match your strikes to the rhythm of the bag. Doing so can improve your aim, timing, and accuracy in the roda.

, While reading capoeira guidebooks and watching how-to videos online is a great way to get into capoeira, capoeira is intended to be shared and practiced with others. Search online for local capoeira academies. If none exist near you, look for university clubs or associations which host friendly tournaments, group training opportunities, or games.

, The roda is where capoeira matches occur and means “wheel” or “circle” in Portuguese. It is not a physical place like a basketball court or a sumo circle. Rather, it is a tight circle created by two capoeiristas (individuals practicing capoeira), the accompanying musicians, and onlookers. A roda can pop up anywhere these elements exist together. Practicing in the roda regularly will help you gain confidence and put your capoeira training to practical use.Face off against others who are at a similar skill level as you in the roda.

, Keep your eyes up and on your opponent. Watch their moves and adapt appropriately. For instance, if your opponent comes at you with a leg sweep jump back, over, or to the side of his or her sweep. Move in with your ginga for a quick strike.


Don’t freeze up in the roda. Capoeira matches might seem intimidating at first, but stay active while in the roda. Respond with whatever you know, whether its a simple ginga, a negativa, or a kick., Paying close attention to not only your mestre’s moves and instruction, but the moves of other, senior capoeiristas for ideas about how to link your movements in a fluid way. There are few formal rules in capoeira, but there are many subtle and informal guidelines which can be gleaned from careful observation of other, well-trained capoeiristas.Use video-recording of your own performance and movements to improve too. With modern digital phones, recording yourself is easy. You can pause and slow-mo these videos to identify aspects of your own technique in need of improvement., Capoeira matches within the roda are incomplete unless accompanied by lively Afro-Brazilian music. The music decides the rhythm and pace within the roda.The primary instruments which capoeiristas play are the atabaque (a tall hand drum), pandeiro (a tambourine-like instrument), and the berimbau (a stringed percussion instrument which leads all others in the roda). The agogo (cow-bell) is another instrument you might see in the roda, and is great for beginners.

, The ginga is the basic movement of capoeira. Bend your knees and put your hands in front of you. Keep your fingers together but loose. Keep your elbows angled out and at ninety degree angles. Keep your head up and eyes forward. This is the starting position.


Next, throw your right arm back, down, and to your side. Straighten your hand into a blade, as if you were striking something slightly behind you on your right side.
At the same time, stretch your left leg back behind you, as if doing a lunge. Bend your foot at the toes. Bring your left arm up and across your chest as if you were reaching to touch your shoulder. Keep your palms down.
Return to the starting position and repeat the lunge-like movement again, but use the opposite side of your body for each step. For instance, if you began the ginga by throwing your right arm down and to the side, throw your left arm down and to the side in the second movement after returning to the starting position.
Continue shifting your weight back and forth between your two feet.
There are many variations of the ginga. For instance, you can move from side to side when performing the ginga, sweep your legs in a wide arc instead of straight back, or get down on one knee instead of bending at the toes., The esquiva lateral is a sideways dodge or escape movement.To perform an esquiva, take one big step sideways with your right leg from a standing position. Your feet should be at ninety degree angles to each other. Place your right hand on the ground to the right of your foot and bend your torso towards the right. Your head should be just above your right knee. Bring your left hand up and place it just above your left cheek. Your fingers should be touching one another.


You can perform an esquiva lateral on your left side as well. Simply reverse the directions of all movements
From the esquiva position, it is easy to strike upwards or bring your stretched leg around into a kick.

, The negativa puts one leg in a squat and the other extended out in front of you. From a standing position, slide the heel of one leg directly out in front of you until your butt almost touches the ground. The knee of your other leg should be bent but the foot should remain on the ground. Bring the hand on the side opposite your extended leg up and hold it close to your face with your fingers straight and together. Place the hand on the same side of the leg you pushed out on the ground with your fingers splayed and pointed away from your body. Keep your body centered over the hand and foot which lay flat on the ground.From the negativa normal, you can easily move into a leg sweep or up into an S-dobrado or chapeu de couro.
There are many variations on the negativa, including one in which you lay your whole body down on the floor. From the basic negative position, lay your torso and the hand which is near your face flat on the ground. Place the side of your face on which your leg is extended to the ground too. For instance, if your left leg is outstretched in front of you, place your left cheek to the floor on your left side, and place your right hand on the floor just in front of your face.

, Like most capoeira techniques, the au has many variations, though all are essentially cartwheels. An easier one is the au cabeca no chao. In this move, you begin with a basic esquiva and turn your torso to the side away from your outstretched leg. Bring the hand which, in the esquiva, is close to your face and above your head all the way over your head while lifting up your leg on the same side. As the hand.Bring both hands and your head onto the floor, and center your weight with your legs. Keep your legs stretched out in front of you in a wide “V.”
When ready, continue the cartwheel. Turn your hips slightly toward the side on which you intend to complete the au. Bring the leg which was outstretched when in an esquiva down to the ground, toes first.
You can move from the au cabeca no chao into an au normal (a variation of the au cabeca no chao in which you do not touch your head to the ground) or a piao de cabeca (a head spin).

, The chapa is a simple kick. Turn your body ninety degrees to one side relative to your opponent. Lift the leg closest to your opponent directly out from your body and toward your opponent’s chest.A variation of the chapa, which may be more comfortable for less flexible capoeiristas, is to turn your non-striking foot all the way around so that it is facing away from your opponent before striking with your other foot.

, The queixada is a solid combo move which starts from the ginga.Step forward with one foot from a middle ginga position. Turn your rear foot and torso slightly to the side your rear foot is on. For instance, if your left foot is forward, turn your torso and right foot about forty-five degrees to the right. Then, turn back toward and bring your back foot up toward your opponent’s body, using your momentum from the turn to provide force.


From there, move back into your ginga routine or follow your queixada with a quick hand strike.
Be sure to turn on the ball of your non-striking foot or you will tear your knee.

, They will fall into one of three categories.


First is the light uniform (approximately 6 oz.) these are usually for the beginners.






The second tier of uniforms is the medium (approximately 10 oz.) which are for more advanced students.
Last is the heavy (approximately 14 oz.) uniforms which is considered the 'masters' uniform. These uniforms are great for a strong grappling style such as Judo.

Realize that the Black Belt is only the beginning.,
Know that earning a Black Belt does not make you a good fighter!,
Fully understand your techniques.,
Be yourself.,
Learn how to apply your techniques!!!,
Learn through teaching.,
Learn from other sources.,
Adapt it to your own personality.",How to Advance Beyond the Black Belt,"


The Black Belt is equivalent to graduating High School. You have proven that you learned required material to be certified as a Black Belt at your academy. Now it is time to learn how to properly use it!;
,


Earning a Black Belt does not mean that you now know how to fight! There are plenty of so called Black Belts out there today who still cannot properly use what they have learned in a real fight.

,


As a Black Belt it is your duty to strive for a higher understanding on how techniques function and how they can be applied in real combative situations. Technical knowledge will help you feel more assured with what you are learning and should make you able to someday think ""outside the box"" regarding how to use the techniques.

,


Don't let the style you are learning consume your personality! Yes techniques are important but if you let yourself fight in the same way as you do in your training you will end up looking too structured in your movements (like a robot). Make sure to be natural while still using what you have learned.

, (MOST IMPORTANT STEP FOR ANY FIGHTER!)


Learning the techniques is the same as being given the tools. This, however, does not mean that you know how to use the tools... It is very important that you do a lot of sparring in order to gain experience.
Just sparring is not enough! You also need to figure out what techniques and strategies you are able to use in a fight by testing them out in sparring. The greatest mistake made by martial artists is thinking that it is enough to simply know the technique... Knowing the technique is not enough. You need to have ABSORBED the techniques through sparring or your techniques won't work.

,


The best way to understand already learned techniques is by teaching them to another person. This not only requires that you demonstrate the techniques properly but also know them in great detail.

,


There is nothing wrong with learning from only one source... But if you really want to exceed other martial artists it is important to expand the horizon and start studying other styles in order to learn other aspects of fighting that you might not know. Sometimes it is beneficial to start learning from a different instructor since not all instructors have the same experience and teaching methods.

,


When you have gained greater insight into which techniques you can apply in sparring, you should adapt these skills into your personal style. This is a good sign which shows that you are able to think for yourself and adapt your fighting method to make it more personalized.

At the very beginning
The moment you hear of a competition you may wish to enter, this is when your training should begin.,
Build up your Stamina
The fight in the ring will last three rounds of 1-2 minutes, depending on what competition you enter.,
Stretch
Constant stretching will allow you to kick higher and faster.,
Equipment
Most sparring matches require the use of the hogu (body protector), a helmet, arm and shin guards, gloves and groin guards for both genders.,
Practice your Kicks
During the tournament, most of the kicks you will be doing are turning kicks, due to competition rules which disallow pushing kicks.,
Practice your Punches
While punching is allowed, it is a commonly known fact that judges rarely count them, and often do not count many kicks as well.,
Practice your Blocking
Blocking off an opponent's attack will deprive them of points.,
Practice your Evading
Another way of defending yourself is to evade the kick.,
Practice your Counterattacks
These kicks are the most likely to score points because many fighters let their blocks fall when they start attacking.,
Check your Fighting Stance
The stance you adopt on fighting in the ring is very important.,
Weight Categories
All fighters must be in their own weight categories in order to make the fight fairer.,
The Day Before the Match
On the day before your match, just practice lightly and do not over strain yourself.",How to Win in Competitive Sparring (Taekwondo)1," You should indicate your interest to your teacher as he is the one who will be your coach during the tournament, and handling most of the administration matters. In most matches, Yellow, blue and red, and black belts compete in Taekwondo sparring tournaments. If you aren't at that level yet, don't despair, but train for the future such that once you are able to enter a competition, you will be better prepared than most.;
, In between, there will be rest periods of about half a minute. In order to sustain this kind of pace, you will need to build up your stamina.


Run every other day, at 70% of your heart rate or do interval sprints. In order to do this, subtract your age from 220. This value is your maximum. Multiply this figure by 70%. The result is the number of beats your heart should make a minute as you run. In order to count this easily, divide it by 6 so that you only have to count for 10 seconds. As you run, press your finger against your carotid artery and feel the pulses, counting for 10 seconds. For example, if you are 16, your maximum heart rate is 220-16=204. 70% of your heart rate is then 204*70%= 142.8. You can thus calculate that in 10 seconds, your heart should beat 142.8/6=23.8. Therefore, as you run, feel to see if your heart beats about 24 beats a minute. If it is, you will be able to build up endurance this way.
Do a whole array of kicks with strength until you are tired, and time yourself. When you are able to keep this up nonstop for 4.5 minutes, you're doing well.

, It also loosens the muscles and prevents strains. Ideally you should stretch everyday. Pushing yourself slightly beyond your limit will allow you to stretch further progressively, but beware of over-aggressive stretching which might result in torn muscles or ligaments.

, The target areas are the front and sides of the hogu, and the front and sides of the head. Any other strike would either not be considered, or considered a foul.

, Only participants above the age of 12 (18 in some places) are allowed to kick at head level. Practice your kicks with a bag or hand mitts, in order to develop accuracy and strength. You should practice the following kicks everyday, at least 10 times each with both legs:


Turning kicks, both with the front and rear legs
Back kicks (Back thrust)
Back hooks
Side kicks
Slamming kicks (Axe Kick)
Jumping back kicks
Jumping back hooks

, Despite this, working on your punches is good, because if you can punch strongly, you will be able to weaken your opponent. Practice with a heavy bag.

, Practice all sorts of blocks until you can do them simultaneously with your kicks. For example, as you do a turning kick, the front of your body may be open, a good place to counter-attack. Ensure you are constantly blocking your head and your body with both arms, and be prepared to knock away kicks from your opponent.

, You should skip away to the side, or backwards, as quickly as possible. Practice this until your reactions are quick and you can successfully dodge a kick at full speed.

, When your opponent brings up their leg for a kick, you should immediately identify what kick it is and counter where they are open. A good counter should involve blocking or evading their attack and then striking quickly. For example:


If the opponent does a turning kick, you can either lean back to avoid it or use your arm to block it, then go in with a turning kick of your own. Or, you could just attack quicker than your opponent, and strike with a suitable back kick or hook. As long as you hit them first, with power, you should be able to earn the points.
If the opponent does a back kick, evade to the side and attack with a turning kick.

, The following tips will ensure a better defence and better attack position:


Stay on the balls of your feet so that you are ready to move when necessary, and move quickly.
Bounce up and down as you do so so that you can hide your next move, and also such that you will be in a better position to perform jumping kicks.
Your front arm should be up and protecting your head from attack. This arm should be primed to move sideways or downwards quickly to block off and attack.
Your other arm should be close to your front and also ready to move.

, You must choose which category you will be in, and stay within that weight. There will be a weigh in several weeks before the fight.

, It would be good to 'carbo-load'. This involves eating starchy foods which store themselves in your body as glycogen, which can easily be used to produce energy during your match. Do not starve yourself to maintain your weight category; neither should you dehydrate yourself.

"
"
On the Morning of your Match
You should have had a well rested night of sleep.,
Turn up Early
You should get the schedule of when your bouts are and proceed to the sparring area early.,
The Final Weight Check
When your bout number is announced, you will proceed to the weight station where you have to report for the match, as well as be weighed to ensure you are within your category, and possibly checked that you are wearing all your protective equipment, that your nails are cut and other safety measures taken to avoid unnecessary injury to yourself or your opponent.

,
The Holding Area
This is possibly the most tense moment you will have.,
The Fight
During the fight itself, trust your coach and do as he says.,
Point deductions may be given out, and these take the form of either half or full points.",How to Win in Competitive Sparring (Taekwondo)2," In the morning, eat foods which release energy slowly and throughout the day, such as carbohydrates. Stretch yourself and mentally run through all your strategies.

, If you are able to get the schedule of when your opponents fight, you can watch them and prepare for your match. Similarly, you should change styles in different rounds so that your strategy cannot be preempted.

,, You will be sitting with your opponent in the holding area, waiting for your turn to go to the ring. If you are nervous at this stage, it's perfectly fine to get up and pace around. This also lets your muscles relax. At the same time, with a rational mind, size up your opponent. For example, by guessing his height, you can prepare to do head kicks.

, Your mind will be focused on attacking your opponent and taking him out, and it is important for your coach to remind you of your strategies. The process is as follows:


The referee points to the ground with their right and left hands, saying 'Chung, Hung'. This means 'blue, red', and indicates where you should stand.
The referee will then say 'chareot' to get you to attention, and 'kyueng-rye' to get you to bow to the judges and each other.
The referee then says 'gyeorugi choonbi', upon which you enter your fighting stance.
He then says 'shijak', and the fight begins!
You should stop immediately if the referee says 'kuman' or 'kalyo'.

, Try to get the first point, as this psychologically intimidates the opponent and gives you an edge up. Attack quickly when the signal is given to start. 1 point is given for kicks to the hogu (body protector), 2 points for kicks to the head (should these be allowed), and 1/2 or 1 point may be deducted for fouls."

Don't be nervous.,

,, It sounds crazy, but it will really help with making kicks and punches snap. If you have more than one uniform and you get a choice, try to wear the one with the least amount of patches or decorations, or the newest one.Some studios will include the cost of a new uniform in the testing fee.

, What did you gain from Taekwondo? What about life can you relate it to? How has it helped you in other aspects of life, and how do you think it will help you in the future? Also, you may or may not be asked to read your essay aloud to the judges, although this is sometimes just for the audience’s sake.

, Don't eat lunch right before the test if it's in the afternoon.

, There's nothing more annoying than having hair in your face and not being able to brush it back, or messing up something because you can't see.

, The only thing more annoying than having hair in your face is acing all the physical tests and then messing up on the exam.

, If you go through forms one last time, just do the basic motions, don't put any power behind them.

,, When you get the chance to rest and breathe for a while, try not to gasp for breath. Even if it feels like you’re not getting enough air at first, keep breathing slowly and deeply.

,, Since you were supposed to practice your demo break before, the judges won’t be impressed by an attempt at something over-ambitious.

, Sometimes in class (especially on weekdays), most people have a tendency to think ""I don't want to be all sore at school/work tomorrow, so I shouldn't do 100% tonight."", or ""Headache tonight - think I'll back off on the yells."" It seems like an obvious thing, but make sure you constantly remind yourself not to back off on anything - if there's ever a time for maximum power/yell/snap/focus, it's now.

, Sometimes the judges will save the hardest part for last, or ask you questions on form meanings after a sparring match to see if you can still focus.

, Even if you don't officially know if you passed or not, the worst is over, and the likelihood is that you did great! Eat a big dinner at a restaurant with family and friends, go out to brunch the next morning, whatever - but do something fun! You've definitely earned it!

Practice blocking, then attacking over and over.,
Practice step one until you have mastered it.,
Do not try to block kicks, dodge them and attack.,
Plan counter attacks to be used in sparring matches based on preference.,
Make good kick combinations that complement your momentum.,
Attack your opponent furiously for a short time then retreat backward, then repeat.

,
Use fake kick combos.,
Counter attacking a counter is usually a lot easier than countering an attack.

",How to Successfully Counter Any Kick in Tae Kwon Do," When you practice, do it in front of a mirror and imagine an enemy, do it slowly till you do it at full power. Remember to do blocks that are most compatible with the kick that is following and keep the opponent open in the strike zone of the counter kick or punch.

, When you have, practice on decreasing the time in between the block and counter until both are simultaneous.

, Dodging does not mean moving back, but sidestepping to avoid a kick. This is very hard to learn, and even harder to do it quickly. Sparring or practicing with a partner is the easiest way to learn this technique. Dodge the push, cut, or side kick by moving to the side the supporting/pivot leg is on. e.g. if your sparring partner attacks with a right leg side kick (from your view), move slightly to the left(DO NOT MOVE BACK!!!), dodging the kick, and attack with a left leg roundhouse to the person's body. Dodge a back kick by moving to the supporting/ pivot leg. You cannot counter this immediately so position yourself to attack when the person fully turns back to face you.(Again, do not move back to dodge the kick). The axe kick can be dodged by sidestepping quickly to either side. It is possible to dodge the roundhouse by moving back slightly opposite to the direction of your 'open' side, but i recommend simply using your palm to push away the kick , because dodging this kick could put you too far away to counter. IMPORTANT - do not try to dodge 'spinning' kicks (360, turn back hook kick) unless they are aimed at your head, in which case you can duck to dodge.

, Remember it is easier to block a turning or spin kick than dodge it and it easier to dodge a forward momentum kick than to block it.

,;
,, For example do a front kick or push kick then turn sideways without putting your foot down and do a sidekick.

Make sure your whole body is limber before practicing poomsae.,
Here is a basic routine you can try:


Start with 30 jumping jacks, then bend all the way forward and back for counts of 10.,
It is very important to stretch the legs in Poomsae.,
Cat stance or beom sohgi.,
Front stance or ahp sohgi.,
Horse stance or juchoom sohgi.,
Practice doing the form with just the stances first.,
Practice hand movements.,
Practice kicks separately first.,
Work on your flexibility.,
Work on the height of your kicks.,
Once you get all the basic movements down, put them all together!,
Add sharpness to all movements when they are perfect.,
After that, add intensity.,
Memorize patterns.,
Have fun!",How to Get Better in Tae kwon do Poomsae," You will need to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour to do basic, daily stretching before each practice.;
, Do 10 total reps.
Then stretch the side of your body by putting your arm on one hip and using the other arm to reach for the other side, and then switch.
Stretch your knees by alternating between bending them and straightening them. After that, circle them to the right 10 times and then to the left 10 times. This is really important because unfortunately knee injuries are incredibly common in TKD.
Do the half splits by bending one knee and extending the other leg and put your head to your knee. Repeat with another leg. Do a 10 count of 10 total reps.
Center split. Sit in the center split and go as far as you can for 10 minutes then sit down and take turns stretching by putting your head to your knee on the left, right, and center. Do a 10 count of 5 reps each.
Front splits (both ways), stay in them for 10 min at a time. If you want to take it a step further sit as far as you can go and put your forehead to your shin for each side.
End with butterfly stretch. Try to push your knees all the way to the ground, and end with putting your nose to the toes or to the ground.
Stretch with kicks: point your toes and keeping your leg straight, swing it as high as possible. Do 10 kicks with each leg.
Jog a few laps.

, Definitely consider stretching in your free time to try to improve on your flexibility:


Sit in full splits for half an hour to an hour a day while reading, doing homework, or watching TV.
Then do front-splits for each leg for about 20 minutes at a time. Try to go deeper every time - you can try standing on X-ray paper and letting your legs slide (but be prepared to have your hands ready to help you stop), or prop your feet up on both sides to deepen the center split.
You can also do the butterfly stretch and have someone press down on your knees from behind (or stand on them).
The more time you can dedicate to stretching, the closer you can get to a vertical sidekick!

,


Place your feet shoulder width apart.
Take a half step to your side and turn your front foot to be in line with the body.
Slightly bend your front knee.
Bend your back leg to make a 90 degree angle.
Back foot should be perpendicular to the front foot and the heels of your feet should be on the same line.
Keep the heel of the front foot off the ground.
Keep your back straight and your hips squared.

,


Stand with your feet shoulder length apart.
Take a big step forward with the front leg and bend your knee, almost as if you are doing a lunge.
Your feet should be facing forward.
Bend your front knee to be at 90 degree angle.
Your back leg should be straight.
Keep your hips straight and pointed to the front.

,


Move your feet to the sides about two shoulder lengths apart.
Bend your knees, as if you are sitting on a chair or riding a horse.
Your feet and hips should face forward.
Keep your back straight.

,


Put your hands on your hips and keep them there the whole time. Practice going through the stances of the form in full first, until your movements are perfect. Either have someone watch you and correct you after each movement, or practice in front of a mirror (stopping to check after each stance). Make sure that your back is straight and your shoulders are square in each movement. Your shoulders should also be lined up.

,


Stand in one place and work on your hand movements without the stances. Go through the whole form and practice until your movements are perfect. Many movements require your hand to be flat and your fingers to be together. If you are making a fist, make sure the fist is tight and your thumb is on the outside.
When your movements are perfect, practice the flow from slow to fast and stick the final motion, so that your movements looks sharp.

, The kicks in Taekwondo have evolved over time. Kicks in Poomsae are traditional kicks, while kicks for fighting are more about power and speed. Balance is important, use full range of motion, and show power.


Practice balance first. While this comes with practicing kicks overtime, you can do additional exercises to practice if this area needs the most improvement. Practice standing on one leg for an extended period of time and finding your center of balance. Switch legs! Once you have this down, try hopping on one leg across a room. Switch legs! You may find that it is easier for you to do this on one leg versus another - but the other leg has just as much potential. Be sure to always practice both legs - who knows, your weaker leg may end up being your stronger leg!
Then work on kicks. The traditional kicks exhibited in Poomsae require a full range of motion. While the kicks and actual movements may be different, the process is the same. First, bring your knee all the way into your chest. When you kick, make sure that your leg is extended all the way in a straight line (if this is a sidekick, make sure your back is a continuation of this line, in most instances you need to arch your back further back to get that line). Similar to the hand movements, you should stick the kick at the end of the extension. After sticking your kick, bring your leg all the way back into your chest. Then bring your leg down the the floor in a controlled manner.

, Flexibility helps a lot in patterns (hence all the suggested stretching!). This is when you will have to be able to do the splits, all three ways. Meaning you must stretch everyday! If you're naturally flexible, you're making people jealous. But that doesn’t mean you still don’t need practice.

, When you are doing patterns, the height of your kick counts. If you kick around your nose and you forehead, that's pretty good. But if you want to blow your master away, kick above you head. The higher the better. This is a combination of flexibility and balance. To work on this type of balance, you can practice your kicks by holding onto something first. You can also practice by kicking up/along a wall while holding onto someone or something. It will take a lot of practice to build strength to get these kicks exactly right, and a lot of practice in general!

, First go through each movement: stance, hand movement, and any kicks. Stop after each movement to make sure that everything is still accurate. Feel free to start slow until you get the combination of all the movements correctly while maintaining proper form. Then show power in your hand movements, in your stance, and in your face - focus! Even with the power added, the movements should remain consistent: you should not lose balance, stance, or any detail.

, Make sure you are sticking your hand movements, your stances, and your kicks.

, Intensity is harder to describe, but it’s the effort you show in each movement, and in your face, as you go through your form. You can also show this with yelling “kihap"" extra loud at the appropriate parts of the form.

, Be diligent while committing to practicing forms. Your goal should to be to continually improve, step by step. Set aside time every day to stretch, do drills to improve areas you need work on, practice, and review your progress. Make sure you get every movement exactly right, but don’t be discouraged if you do not, just try it again!


Patterns can be harder than sparring. This is because you only have one shot in winning a poomsae competition. One shot to make everything exactly right. In sparring, if they kick you, or if you kick them, a point is gained. Memorizing patterns is important. If you forget a pattern halfway, you cannot win. To take it a step further and commit your physical memory to getting every movement right is even more difficult! But if you believe in yourself it can be done!

, Practice makes perfect. It is like building a house from the ground up - you need a strong foundation. Seeing your final result after all your hard work and being able to share it is the most satisfying result!

Understand Taekwondo’s religious and philosophical influences.,
Learn the 5 tenets of Taekwondo.,
Hone your sense of discipline.,
Avoid distractions.,
Develop your manners.",How to Do Taekwondo1," Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism are the main influences of Taekwondo.Each one of these religions teach people to be altruistic, to help their fellow man, and to avoid needless conflict.Korean Buddhism is a strain of the Mahayana tradition and dates back to the 4th century. It stresses thoughtful contemplation and the recognition of suffering. The Buddhist insistence on non-violence is probably its most profound influence on Taekwondo.
Confucianism made its way into Korea gradually around the 3rd-2nd century BCE. Confucianism is often considered to be as an ethical and philosophical system more than a religion. Its main tenets stress the importance of family and respect for others. The stress on respect in Taekwondo, in part, owes to Confucianism.
Taoism has had the least influence on Korea and Taekwondo out of the three intellectual systems. It first spread in Korea around the 8th century. Yet, its respect for nature and focus on thoughtful meditation have influenced and reaffirmed basic principles in Taekwondo.;
, They are courtesy (Ye UI), integrity (Yom Chi), perseverance (In Nae), self-control (Guk Gi), and indomitable spirit (Baekjul Boolgool). Professional Taekwondo martial artists take these principles very seriously., Discipline means practicing your craft constantly, but it also means only using your martial art techniques in situations that call for it. Don’t be quick to fight. Find non-violent means to resolve conflicts.


Truly great Taekwondo marital artists are dedicated to their practice. They practice their techniques and study Asian philosophies on a regular, if not daily, basis. If you want to be a great Taekwondo martial artist, you'll need to show the same level of dedication.

, Taekwondo teaches its practitioners to avoid idleness, which breads boredom and contempt. Have goals for yourself and persevere in those goals.


Find goals that benefit you and your community as a whole. While Taekwondo is not an evangelical movement, it does encourage its practitioners to set a good example for others and to be able to spread its message of discipline and peace.

, Taekwondo teaches you to avoid conflict whenever possible. This starts with your manners. If you enter a situation and immediately insult/offend someone, you’ll invite conflict. Be calm and respectful to everyone. Courtesy and mutual respect are central tenets of Taekwondo.

Always warm up.,
Stretch.,
Get physically fit.,
Take care of your body.",How to Do Taekwondo2," Before you start your training, begin with basic warm up exercises. You need to get blood flowing to your limbs and muscles so they can be in tip top shape. Jump-roping is one of the best ways to warm up because it increases your stamina as well. Other exercises include mountain climbers, squat thrusts, and running in place., Taekwondo is about taking your body to the next level. In order to be able to perform many martial arts moves properly, you need to be very flexible and limber. Trying to perform a high kick without stretching will most likely result in pulled muscles, which will hinder your ability to improve.


The main part of your body to stretch are your ham strings. Since Taekwondo focuses primarily on the legs, you’ll want to be the most flexible there. Touch your toes and hold it for at least 1 minute. Then move on to your other lower body stretches like groin stretches, standing calf stretches, angle rotations, and crossed leg stretches. Conclude with core and upper body stretches like forearm rolls, triceps stretches, posterior shoulder stretches, and side stretches.Stretch on a daily basis. If you skip days often, your muscles will contract and lose their elasticity. Even if you aren’t going to the gym or dojang (the Korean name for a Tae kwan do school) everyday, be sure to take 15 minutes at home and stretch your arms, legs, and core.

, Martial arts require the same level of fitness as any other sport. In order to get fit, you need to focus on your lower body, core, and upper body muscles. There are a lot of different exercises you can do, but you want to choose those exercises that replicate movements done in Taekwondo.


For leg exercise, do calf raises, hamstring exercises, lateral jumps, leg extension exercises, leg presses, and squat thrusts.To exercise your core, do bicycle crunches, reverse crunches, leg raises, planking exercises, Russian twists, and normal sit-ups.To strengthen your upper body, do pull-ups, push-ups, bench presses, bicep curls, dumbbell flys, and chest dips., Taekwondo is a contact sport and injuries happen. At the first sign of discomfort, stop and tend to your muscles. Do not practice while injured. Do not compete while injured. Taekwondo can wreak havoc on your muscle joints. After so many jumps, kicks, and punches, your knees, hips, elbows, and shoulders can become increasingly susceptible to wear and tear. The best way to take care of any muscle strain is to observe RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation."

Do your research on the instructor themselves. Get references and check out his or her social media site. A lot of times, you can get a good idea of how “intense” a Taekwondo instructor will be based on their online presence. Check out yelp.com and other online sites where parents and students can post comments about a Taekwondo school and its instructors. Taekwondo is supposed to be a peaceful, defensive martial arts.
Make sure that the instructor is World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) certified in Taekwondo.

, The very first thing to learn when you start Taekwondo is the bow. The bow is a respectful greeting to your teacher and opponent. It reaffirms the notion that Taekwondo is a disciplined and respectful practice.


Stand still on the ground with your feet close and your heels touching. Clench your fists in front of your body and then open your arms. You need to do this when you hear the command ""Charyeot"" (차렷).
Lean forward when you hear the command ""Gyeongnye""(경례)., Instructors and others in the Taekwondo community use specific names for stances and moves. Each technique has its own name. Some places use the original Korean name and others adopt an English equivalent.

, One of the most important skills a martial artist needs to master is their footwork. Stand in front of a mirror and practice shifting your feet forwards and backwards and from side to side. Make sure that you are taking quick compressed steps as opposed to long and slow steps. When in an actual match, your opponent will be looking for weaknesses and long, slow movements is a dead giveaway.


When you feel comfortable with your footwork, throw in some fakes. Shift your weight in one direction and then quickly move in the opposite direction. When your opponent is watching your movement, this slight shift can make a big difference. After you’ve mastered fakes, try some kicks. All movements should be fluid and quick., Taekwondo is set apart from other forms of the martial arts, because of its focus on footwork and kicks. In order to kick properly, you must pay close attention to both of your feet. One foot will be for striking. You need to have excellent aim, follow-through, and strength, but if your other leg doesn’t provide the base needed, your kick will be ineffective. Make sure that your non-kicking leg is firmly placed. You must be able to balance on that leg and to shift balance while you are kicking.


Practice standing on one leg in front of a mirror. Hold that position for 1 minute. Then extend your other leg out as far as you can — either forward, backward, or to the side. Hold that position for 1 minute. Then switch legs. Balance on your other leg and extend the other out as far as you can. Hold for the same amount of time. A great Taekwondo artist needs to have the ability to kick with both feet, which requires excellent balance with both legs.

, While Taekwondo emphasizes leg work, you need to learn how to punch properly as well. Always keep your thumb on the outside of your hand. If you tuck your thumb inside, against your palm, and then make contact, you run the risk of breaking your thumb.


Like with your legs, you need to pay attention to your base. Most martial artists will tell you that the real strength behind a great punch is not necessarily arm strength, but leg and core strength. As you throw your punch, be sure to set a solid base with your legs and twist your core in tandem, adding extra force behind your arm.

, Everyone wants to break boards on the first day of Taekwondo practice, but it takes time, patience, and practice to do so. You must concentrate on the exact spot you plan to hit. Then strike and follow through. Practice your form and technique outside of class (if you are taking one). Ask a friend to hold a board for you. Either just hit the board and have your friend pull it back at the last second or actually try to break it.


Hang a kicking board attached to a bungie chord from the ceiling and practice kicking or hitting it in a particular spot. You won’t break it, because it will recoil and swing around, but you’ll be able to hone your accuracy and increase your strength., So much of Taekwondo is about maintaining peace. Some even say that Taekwondo is synonymous with self-defense. There are numerous self-defense strategies you should practice.


If someone has you in a “bear-hug” from behind and your arms are immobilized, stomp on the attacker's foot to distract him and then step back aligning your hips next to his and then bend forward quickly. This should break the attacker's hold over you and even possibly flip them over, giving you time to escape or to prepare to fight.
If your attacker has you by the wrist, start with a front kick to the body or groin and then quickly turn your wrist until the attacker’s thumb and fingers are facing you. The attacker’s grip will be loosed at this angle and you should be able to pull away easily.
There are numerous other self-defense techniques that a Taekwondo teacher can show you. ""Bear-hugs"" and wrist grabs are just two of the most common self-defense situations., Forms, also known as ""hyungs"" in Korean, are sets of offensive and defensive maneuvers performed on imaginary opponents. They are basically choreographed martial arts moves that people use to practice basic techniques and transitions. At most Taekwondo dojangs, you will need to show mastery of several forms before you can progress to the next stage or receive your next belt.Remember that forms are all about form. Make sure that you are not simply moving from one move to another. Pay close attention to your footing and arm and leg movements., Once you have achieved a degree of mastery, you will be able to start sparring. Find a partner, who has achieved a similar level of training. You should spar in a controlled and safe setting. At first, sparring will be like practicing your forms with another person. Later, you will really spar. This will entail attacking each other and countering each other’s moves."

Begin by chambering your leg.,
Extend your leg to deliver the kick.,
Retract your leg.",How to Deliver a Roundhouse Kick in Tae Kwon Do,": Pick up the knee of the kicking leg directly in front of you above waist level. The higher your target, the higher you should raise your knee. Fold your knee tightly. Point your kicking foot and toes downward. Turn the hip over by turning the toes of the supporting foot away from the target. (Do not allow the kicking knee to dip or point downward) At this point the shin and thigh of your kicking leg should be parallel to the floor. Point the chambered knee past your target so that your kick will penetrate past the target’s surface.;
,: Deliver the kick by unfolding the leg at the knee, rotating through the target and snapping the hips over at the moment of impact. The target should be struck at ninety-degree angle before your leg reaches full extension and the kick should be allowed to continue and penetrate several inches past the surface before returning.

,: Retract the leg as quickly as possible by bending the knee tightly. The less time the foot is in contact with the target the more ""shock"" will be transferred to the target, the longer you foot is contact with the target the more pushing power will be transferred to the target. At this point the leg can return to the chambering position in preparation for a second kick or returned to the floor.

"
"
Start in a comfortable guarding stance or walking stance.,
Find your target.,
Bring your knee up to your chest level.,
When you reach the top of your kick pull it down upon the target as hard as you can.,
Keep your foot slightly pointed and make contact with the heel.,
Step down into a Guarding stance.

",How to Perform an Axe Kick in Tae Kwon Do,";
, In reality you’re aiming for your opponent’s face primarily the nose. You can also aim for the neck-shoulder area.

, Bringing your knee up will make this kick get up to the desired height faster. If you keep your leg straight the whole time it makes this kick a lot harder to do when your opponent is close. Seeing how this kick is more of a close-range kick, you wouldn't want to be too far away from your opponent.

, Move the whole leg, keeping the knee slightly bent.

, You can also use the ball of the foot for a faster but less powerful strike.

,"
"
Understand that in the closed stance both fighters have the same leg forward.,
Know that your opponent's target will be the outer thigh of your front leg, particularly where the nerves 'cutaneous femoris lateralis' and 'femoralis' (rami cutanei anteriores) run.,
Lift the knee of your front foot as soon as you see your opponent's kick coming.,
Turn your shin outward by rotating your foot to the outside (if your left foot is forward, your toes will be pointing at 9 o'clock; if your right foot is forward, your toes will be pointing at 3 o'clock.,
Flex your ankle by pulling your toes up.,
Bend the knee of your supporting leg slightly.

,
Exhale sharply when your opponent strikes your shin.,
Recognize that in the open stance both fighters have a different leg forward; their navel's will be facing the same direction, effectively a mirror image of each other.

,
The target will change in this instance from the outer thigh of your front leg to the inner thigh.,
Lift the knee of your front leg to waist height.,
Pull your toes upward.,
Move your knee across your body so that your shin meets with your opponent's kicking foot/leg.

,
Exhale sharply on impact.

",How to Do a Tae Kwon Do Kick Take Down1,";
, One way to learn the location of this spot is to stand upright and extend your arm along the side of your thigh. The spot will be at the top of your middle finger.

, Your knee should be tightly flexed.

, For reference, 12 o'clock is directly in front of you and 6 o'clock is behind). The rotation of your foot should begin at the ankle.

, This will contract the muscles of your shin, which will act as shock absorbers when your opponent's kick impacts against your shin bone.

,, If you do all of the above correctly, the kick will hurt your opponent more than you. See the ""tips"" section for advice on how to condition your shins for absorbing impact.

,, This is particularly much more sensitive as the muscles in this region (adductor group) have more pain receptors than any other part of the upper leg. The defence will be similar to that for a closed stance attack.

, Flex the knee (i.e. bend it) so that the muscles of your thigh are contracting tightly.

, This will contract the muscles of your shin.

,,"
"
Place your front leg down on the floor as soon as you have blocked your opponent's kick.

,
Land on the ball of the foot so you can ""spring"" that same leg up into an immediate counter-attack.,
Lift your knee straight up, flexed as in the preparatory block described above.,
Pull your toes back (you will be striking with the ball of your foot).

,
Extend you foot forwards, pushing from your hip.

,
Pull your upper body back slightly to gain more reaction force.

,
Exhale sharply on impact.

,
Your target will be anywhere on your opponent from the waist up.,
Note that your opponent will be aiming for the area on your torso commonly known as the ""floating ribs."",
Know that by far the easiest defence against such a technique is to simple lower the elbow for whichever arm is covering that side in your guard.

,
Keep your elbow tightly flexed.,
Exhale sharply as you absorb the impact.

,
Alternatively, you can raise your shin to meet the kick if, a) you are flexible enough to lift your knee that high, and b) if your opponent is significantly lighter and slower than you.

",How to Do a Tae Kwon Do Kick Take Down2,", Your window of opportunity is small, so you need to act as soon as possible.

, This is the chamber for your front kick.

,,,,, Your opponent's balance will be off and their guard lowered after you block their kick, so you will have free reign on any permitted target area that presents itself. The stomach is a good bet because it is relatively harder to miss than the head, and you can strike here as a set-up for a devastating punch combination.

, This is located on either side of your body, roughly one-hand width above your kidneys. It is also known as the oblique section of the abdominal muscle group.

,, You will either hit your opponent's foot with the point of your elbow (if you time it right - and your opponent will know about it if you do!), or you will absorb the impact on the outer triceps / biceps brachialis. The tighter you flex your elbow, the better your muscles will act as shock absorbers.

,,"
"
Widen your legs if you absorb the kick with your arm.,
Punch your opponent in the head or face with your other hand.,
You will block against your opponent's kick with whatever arm is on the same side as the target area (i.e.,
If blocking with your rear arm, bring your elbow up as though striking upwards with the point of your elbow; your wrist should be approximately at the outer edge of your ear.,
The action is similar to combing your hand through your hair on the side of your head, stopping when your wrist reaches the outer edge of your ear, as described above.,
The elbow is kept tightly flexed.

",How to Do a Tae Kwon Do Kick Take Down3," A wider base will keep you more stable, and will allow you to launch into a counter much quicker than if you had a narrower stance.

, Don't bother trying to kick back - your legs will be too busy trying to keep you upright, while your other (free) hand is doing nothing. Make it do something.

, if your opponent is intending to kick you on the right side of your head, you need to block with your right arm).

, Your forearm and upper arm will be covering much of your head and side of your face (and, lest we forget, your neck, which is of equal importance). The block with your front arm will be a much exaggerated version of this.

, This position offers the best protection to the vital points on your head.

,"
"The principles here are similar to defending against a body kick - your legs are busy keeping your standing, so make the whole affair easier on yourself by choosing a simple, effective straight punch to your opponent's face, instead of trying to kick back while you are off balance also.",How to Do a Tae Kwon Do Kick Take Down4,

, You'll need its exact location (some clubs have several facilities on a few different addresses, so choose the one closest to you), the time when training sessions are held, the monthly membership price, whether or not there are discounts or free try-out periods (many clubs have these, it gives you a chance to train there a month or two for free and see if you're really up for it) and whether or not there are any requirements. If the club/academy has a web page, be sure to check it out.

, Watch the way the teacher/sensei works with his/her disciples, if he/she has any specific demands. Talk to the students during breaks, ask for their opinions on the club, the sensei, and the way they work.

, If it is, sign in and get to work. Mind that taekwondo is hard, and the first few months of training will be tough for you. Also keep in mind that the free try-out periods are oftentimes a mere shade of what training in that club/academy is really like.

Understand the guiding principle of Tae Kwon Do.,
Learn integrity and respect through further study of the art.,
Use it to gain confidence when young.,
Enjoy at all ages.,
Use it as a stress buster.,
Enjoy the peaceful aspect of Tae Kwon Do.,
Understand the philosophy of the art.",How to Appreciate the Benefits of Taekwondo," It is that the practitioner should not attack, unless first confronted by an attack. If possible talk your way out of a confrontation.


Tae Kwon Do is designed to make the student non-violent, to develop a positive outlook and a feeling of confidence. Through the study of this art, students will overcome fear that naturally develops in a confrontation. Confident and free of fear, a Tae Kwon Do student is better able to control the attacker, using only the amount of force necessary.;
, The first thing taught in the dojang is the bow to show respect for the teacher and fellow students. While preserving their unique individuality, the student will become a more well-rounded person. Tae Kwon Do teaches its practitioners to contribute to society, respect the seniors, have compassion for their juniors and treat the environment with respect. They strive to become a more disciplined, focused, and peaceful individual.

, In today's society, the ability of a young woman and a man to defend her/himself is very important. But while learning self defence, the young person will also learn respect, courtesy, and self-control while participating in a good exercise programme. As students of Taekwondo, you build self-confidence and self esteem while you progress in the art. Each of these characteristics improves attitudes.


It has been shown time and again that children who train in Taekwondo tend to improve in their studies due to the concentration and self discipline that is developed.

, Many adults wrongly believe that martial arts are only for the young. Apart from the self-defence aspect, Tae Kwon Do also promotes general health and well being. The training helps to strengthen and tone the muscles of the body without producing large bulky muscles. The high-repetition, low-resistance movements develop a longer, leaner, and more flexible musculature. As well as increasing cardiovascular fitness, the training serves as an invaluable tool for improving flexibility, co-ordination, sharpening reflexes and controlling weight.


Since the body sets its own limits, injuries and strains are rare and the student's physical condition paces himself/herself automatically. The entire muscle system of the body from the fingers to the toes is brought into play.

, Tae Kwon Do also relieves the stresses of modern life. Many psychologists are now recommending martial arts as an antidote for stress-related problems. The total concentration employed while in a Taekwondo class effectively 'blows away the cobwebs' giving the student a complete break from the worries and tensions which gradually sap people's energy and drive. Students commonly arrive for class feeling drained after a tough day and leave feeling refreshed and revitalized.

, It promotes peace, harmony, and ultimately a better society. Unfortunately, many people believe that the martial arts spawn violence. When properly and responsibly taught, this is not true. The Tae Kwon Do student is trained to avoid conflict at all costs and only to use their skills when all other measures have been exhausted.

, It can be summed up by the 5 tenets of Tae Kwon Do:


Courtesy
Integrity
Perseverance
Self Control
Indomitable Spirit

"
"
Take the oath.,
Show courtesy and respect to the instructor and all other students at all times.,
Be honest at all times in your study of Taekwondo, not only to your instructor and your fellow students, but also to yourself.

,
Persevere: exercises are often tough and there will many times when you want to give up, but to persevere is to carry on regardless.

,
Adopt an indomitable spirit: it is likely that you will suffer set backs at some point during your practice of Taekwondo, but it is important not to let these put you off.,
Be sensible: don't overtrain or try to continue with an injury.,
Train regularly: at least three times a week to get the most out of it.

,
Grade whenever possible: don't miss a grading, prepare yourself properly and be ready for it on time.

,
Compete in tournaments: put your skills to the test against new people.,
Ask Black Belts to help: in most Dojangs, the black belts are friendly and more than willing to help you, whether you need to go over your form, kicking, or blocks.,
Pay your training fees on the day they are due, and make sure your license and club membership are up to date.

,Do extra exercise outside your Taekwondo classes to build fitness, strength and flexibility

,
Eat sensibly: make sure your diet is high in protein for muscles and carbohydrates for energy (especially on training days).

,
Drink water: before, during and after training.,
Practice everything you are taught.,
Be sure to warm up and cool down.",How to Be a Good Taekwondo Student," Each Taekwondo practicing ground/hall should take an Oath either in English or local language as per the following:


We solemnly affirm that we shall be ready to maintain sovereignty and unity of the Nation in the disciplined way.
We shall not take part in any illegal activities.
We always be ready to save the people in guard and poor.;
, Black belts should be referred to as 'Sir' or 'Ma'am'. At the end of any exercise where you have worked with a partner or group, you must bow to your partner or to the members of your group and say 'Thank you'. Courtesy is a key part of Taekwondo.

,,, 'Fall Seven times, stand up eight'.

, Listen to your body. If you are injured, take some time off and come back when you are ready.

,,, Watch other students and pick up tips.

, Just ask nicely, be polite and remember to thank them for their time.

Perform the movement properly:


Move light as if rubbing post the ground.,
Understand why this stance works:


Type gestures that cause the opponent to lose balance.,
Become familiar with the various types of stances/movements of the body and food:

Move foot forward
MOOLLOBAL:
Move foot backward
KUIROBAL:
Move with feet by drawing
MIKEUREUMBAL:
Move foot simultaneously
JAJEUNBAL:
Move foot side by side
BEEKYOBAL:

DWIDORABAL:
Move by turning around

,
Beginning from a natural stance facing forward toward the opponent, place one foot in front of the other and turn your body so that you are no longer standing squarely facing the opponent and less of your body is exposed to the opponent.

,
Your feet need to be approximately one shoulder length apart and parallel (at approximately a 45 degree angle from the target) to each other.,
Lean slightly onto the front of your feet so that your heels are off the floor.,
Bend both knees slightly but not a lot.,
Keep both hands up and shoulders relaxed so they are not stiffened and up.,
Keep your eyes on the target.

,
Relax.,
Following these steps should give you a pretty good fighting stance that allows you to execute Tae Kwon Do techniques with ease.

,
Practice in front of a mirror so that you can see everything you are doing without looking down or shifting your weight.

",How to Assume a Fighting Stance in Taekwondo,"
A stepping must be preformed smoothly and with agility to be affective.
Focus must be on leaping the balance of the body.
The movement must be carried out with revolution and self-confidence.;
,
Footwork that makes the opponent loses sense and distance.
Drawing that falsely cause the opponent to think there is something wrong.
Target open for attack easily.
To avoid being attacked.
To launch an accurate and timely attack.

,,, The target, the ball of your front foot, and the heel of your back foot should be on the same line so that the back foot is slightly to the side of the front foot. In Tae Kwon Do, we do this so that we can execute techniques such as front snap kick or roundhouse without having to adjust the foot position first.

, Don't try to stand all the way up on your toes, but this way you can move quickly and pivot without having to adjust your weight.

, Just avoid keeping your knees locked and standing stiffly. Keep the center of your belt just over the middle of both feet so that you know you are standing with the center of your mass in the middle.

, Hands up, shoulders down.

,, A good fighting stance allows you to be ready with out wearing you out. Being stiff makes you rigid and also will make you tired before even starting.

Spar with a lot of different people at your gym.
Don't take Patterns as a joke. Try hard and use your core.;
, This allows for fine tuning your technique and making more progress.


Don't try anything too harsh. You can always spar at the gym. At home practice blocks and not too harsh kicking techniques to brush up on those skills.

, This is very important to all aspects of your training as it allows for higher, faster, and better looking techniques. This area of training is often overlooked.


If you want higher kicks, stretching is right for you. Not only do you need flexibility, but you also need to make sure you chamber and extend!

, Mainly focus on Cardio as you will have to give your all in a small amount of time. This also gives you a head up on sparring. Assuming two sparring rounds of two minutes each with a 30 second break between, you should ideally be able to fight at your peak speed for the entire sparring period.


Remember that you shouldn't only train hard when a tournament is coming up. You should train your best EVERYDAY so you can get better FAST and you don't have to worry about not being ready for a tournament.

,


Relax and do a light jog. Warming up is the most important. Don't do splits right away as you can rip a muscle.

Make a running start towards the target and jump off the leg you are NOT going to kick with.,
Expect difficulty.,
Learn how to perform the different flying kicks.",How to Execute Flying Kicks (Twimyo Chagi) in Taekwondo1," Fly through the air (several feet to several meters depending on your ability) and make contact with your target. The leg you jumped off from should be pulled up close to your body (including your hands) after you are in the air while flying. It is vitally important to keep your body protected from falling while landing. When the kick is completed, return to a good fighting stance.;
, Flying kicks in Taekwondo are more difficult than standard kicks and are awarded more points in competition as a result. A flying kick is a risk that comes with good rewards if it succeeds.

, Now that you've decided to undertake flying kicks as part of your training, you'll need to be aware of what they are and learn each in turn. In summary, the five flying kicks are:


1. Flying side kick (Twimyo Yeop Chagi)
2. Flying back kick (Twimyo Dwi Chagi)
3. Flying front kick (Twimyo Ap Chagi)
4. Flying roundhouse kick (Twimyo Dollyo Chagi)

Look for discrepancies between the art and the school.,
Research the instructor.,
Research the students.,
Study the costs.",How to Choose a Taekwondo School," A complete Taekwondo curriculum includes: philosophy, meditation, basics, forms, self-defense, sparring, breaking, stretching, leadership skills and fitness. A school that doesn't strictly adhere to this curriculum, or to Korean traditions and standards in general, may still be a good school. But, the further it strays from tradition, the more careful you need to be in judging the school. At the very least, inquire as to why these discrepancies exist, and expect an answer that checks out.

Taekwondo is a Korean martial art. In Taekwondo there are weapons such as staffs, kamas, nunchuck, etc. Many Taekwondo schools add weapons training as a way to supplement a curriculum.



 


Traditional Taekwondo uses a white uniform called a dobok. The white uniform symbolizes purity and perfection of character that Taekwondo students are expected to strive for. It is common for schools that do not understand the philosophy or history of Taekwondo to utilize lots colorful uniforms, stripes and patches.






Taekwondo teaches self-defense. Physical fitness is a pre-requisite for self-defense. Limited contact sparring is also an essential step to learning adequate self-defense skills. Beware Taekwondo schools that do not practice sparring, use only non-contact sparring or avoid competitions altogether. Competition, not isolation, breeds excellence.






Taekwondo is distinctly and proudly Korean. In Korean a Taekwondo school is called a ""Dojang"" and sometimes ""Kwan"". The Korean terms for instructor ""Sabonim"" and ""Kwan Jang"" for the person in charge of the school. Beware Taekwondo schools that use the Japanese or Chinese terms such as ""Dojo"", ""Professor"", ""Sifu"" or ""Sensei"".







Taekwondo is a martial art, not a sport! Taekwondo sparring is an Olympic sport; however, sparring is only one aspect of a complete Taekwondo curriculum. A school that focuses only on sparring is incomplete just as a school that does not include sparring is incomplete. The main training consists of: Sparring, workouts, stretching and playing educative games.

For WTF Taekwondo: The South Korean government recognizes the Kukkiwon in Seoul Korea as the World Taekwondo Federation Headquarters. The Kukkiwon issues international black belt certification, instructor certification, publishes the Kukkiwon textbook, sets the standards for techniques and forms and holds an international tournament each year called the Hanmadang. Many unqualified WTF instructors do not even know what the Kukkiwon is. A WTF instructor who is not certified by the Kukkiwon may still be qualified, but they should at least be familiar with the Kukkiwon; their qualifications can be judged by the remainder of the steps below...






For ITF Taekwon-Do: Does the instructor claim to 'do ITF Taekwon-Do' yet is not qualified by the ITF. The ITF has split into 3 factions, however anyone teaching ITF Taekwon-do should be recognised by at least one of them. The ITF set the technical standards and approve gradings.






How long has the instructor been practicing? What is the instructor's rank? For WTF Taekwondo, the Kukkiwon recognizes 4th degree black belt as the minimum rank required for instructors. This usually takes a minimum of 12 years of training.Find the instructor's certification and research the organization that issued the certification. Call and verify the certification.






Get professional references and verify them. Other reputable instructors that can vouch for the instructor is a start. Professional associations are another place to check.






Do a criminal background check. This is important! A lot of people that have martial arts background but fail to legitimately make it in the business world will turn to martial arts as a career because it is not regulated by the government. It is relatively easy to fool the uneducated public about martial arts qualifications. Would you trust this person with your child/wife/husband? Some instructors abuse their position of authority and trust by treating children and women inappropriately.Remember that instructors aren't regulated, so it is up to you to decide whether this is someone you trust your loved ones with.






A real master is someone with an unusual level of skill that is usually accompanied by an unusual level of humility and dedication to serving others. In ITF Taekwondo the rank of master is given to 7th and 8th Dans, and the title of Grandmaster is given to 9th Dans. Beware of anyone claiming to do ITF Taekwondo and claiming to be a 10th Dan as no such grade exists in the ITF.






See if the instructor has a Facebook or other social network profile. Beware the instructor who has filled this with foul language, insults of other martial artists and other examples of lack of respect.







, Always watch a class at the school you are considering before joining. If possible, watch a promotion test / grading. A good school has nothing to hide and will allow spectators. Are the students happy? Disciplined? Competent? Physically fit? Well groomed? Well spoken? Taekwondo is about discipline...a good Taekwondo school should have very well behaved students that speak politely, treating others with a level of respect sadly lacking in today's society.

Watch other area martial arts classes and watch videos on Youtube. How do these students compare?






Find out how many black belts the school has and how long it has been going. Large numbers of black belts, especially very young ones usually means very low standards, unregulated by genuine associations.






A good school is clean and solemn. There should be sense of dignity while class is conducted. The students and the spectators should be well behaved. Teachers should not tolerate rowdy behavior.






Beware schools that look like day cares. If it looks and smells like a day care go elsewhere. Undisciplined children running about is a big warning sign.






Beware the instructor who is clearly unfit / overweight and does not join in anything physical him / herself. The instructors should be able to demonstrate anything that they teach you.






Ask the instructor to show you the practical applications of the techniques you are being taught. If they don't work then find another instructor who can show you how to do them so that they work.







, Some schools place more emphasis on profits than on discipline and skill. Sometimes there are associated fees that you won't find out about unless you ask: belt test, association membership, and long-term contracts. It's not unusual for the school to ask for an annual contract (especially since most people quit within 6 months) but some schools will say that you can break the contract if you want, then when the time comes, they are uncooperative; and some schools have a “bait and switch” program in which they let you pay on a monthly basis for a certain amount of time, then require that you sign a long-term (2-4 year) contract in order to advance in rank. A good school should never have to resort to these tactics in order to gain students."

The Sonnal Makki (hand blade blocking) – this is designed to use the sharpness of a hand blade to block.
Palmok Makki (wrist block) – this is usually carried out by one wrist alone, but it may also be assisted by the other wrist in case of heavy attack.

Get a target.,
First, practice just the motion of the kick.,
Keep practicing your kicks slowly, making sure your movements are absolutely exact and accurate.








,
Once your kicks are perfect, slightly increase the speed with which you hit your target.,
Add power to your kicks as you keep practicing.,
To practice accuracy, speed, and control at the same time, use a smaller target.,
Practice the motion of bringing up your knee quickly.,
Lead in to the kick is important.,
Lead out of the kick is also important, so you can get ready for your next step.,
Staying light on your feet will help you increase the speed as well.",How to Increase the Speed and Accuracy of Your Kicks in Tae Kwon Do2," You can use a kicking pad or a kicking target specifically for Taekwondo that you can buy. You can also use a stiff or folded piece of paper as your target or an X-ray paper.









If you don’t have a partner to work with and want a target, you can make one yourself using a nail, string, tennis ball and a small plastic sandwich bag. Place the ball in the bag, then use the string to tie the bag closed being sure to leave a few extra feet of string. Drive the nail into a ceiling or, if you can't kick over 5 1⁄2 feet (1.7 m), a door frame will work. Tie the string from the bag to the nail in the ceiling so that it hangs down about 6 inches (15.2 cm) lower than you can kick.

, Do not try be fast or put too much power into the kick, just make sure your kick motion is perfect. Hit the target, but focus more on the motion and less on the power.








,, When you kick movements are once again perfect at the new speed, increase the speed a little more.








, But make sure your movements remain exact.









When training to increase your speed or power, don’t forget about the accuracy. Accuracy is as important as the speed.

, Ask a friend to hold up a his or her fist or just hold a smaller target, such as a piece of paper at different heights for you to kick.








, Since you need to bring up your knee for some kicks, speeding up this motion will improve your speed as well. Practice pulling your knee faster to increase speed.








, Practice sliding and stepping into the kick. If the lead in to the kick is faster, it will give you momentum to kick faster as well. Incorporation of fast footwork and the kick will increase your overall speed.








, Practice quickly stepping away from the target after you kick.








, If you keep your weight on the front of your feet, you’ll be able to move faster versus if you keep your weight on your heels.








"
"
Buy ankle weights from a sporting goods store or department store.,
Put on a thick pair of socks.,
Don't practice kicking with weights on; you'll risk serious knee injury if you do!

,
While wearing the weights, practice different leg exercises, such as lateral leg raises, lunges, squats.,
Practice your kicks as per usual, but without weights!,
Watch to see that after a few weeks you'll be so much faster at kicking when not wearing your weights that you'll be able to wait on someone to start to kick you, and you'll be able to kick them first.

",How to Increase the Speed and Accuracy of Your Kicks in Tae Kwon Do3," Consult with someone who is an expert in Taekwondo to get the right weights for your height, weight, and experience.

, Put on the ankle weights after you are dressed in the morning and wear them constantly throughout the day, even when driving, or working if you can. If they become uncomfortable to the point you can't bear it anymore, take them off for a few minutes then put them back on.

,, This will work out your leg muscles and make your legs stronger.

, Make sure you focus on accuracy of your kick before proceeding to improving speed.

Position your body properly to execute a front kick (Ap-Chagi).,
Lift your knee towards your target.,
Rotate your standing foot.,
Use your hips.,
Extend your leg.,
Hit your target with the ball of your foot.",How to Execute the Major Kicks in Taekwondo1," The target of a front kick is — not surprisingly — in front of you. Your target should be a “leg-length” away from your body for your kick to be effective. In some cases, you might jump a little forward or backward to make sure that your kick lands. If this is the case, you’ll also want to make sure that you have sufficient room around you to complete your front kick.





;
, Which leg you choose to perform the kick with will depend on a number of factors. If your opponent’s weak side is on the left, you’ll want to kick with your left leg. If you are performing several kicks in a row, you might want to vary which leg you use to keep your sparring partner off guard. In any case, you’ll want to make sure that your thigh is pointed directly towards your target in order to line up your kick.







, One of the keys to a strong front kick is establishing a strong base. If you don’t rotate your standing foot, you’ll topple or waver from side to side, making your attack less precise. Turn your foot to compensate for this.







, Your taekwondo front kick depends on the momentum of your hips as much as the strength of your leg. When you rotate your standing foot, make sure that you are also pushing forward with the side of your hip that aligns with which leg is kicking. For example, if you are performing a front kick with your right foot, when you adjust your left standing foot, push the right side of your pelvis forward. This added momentum will carry through your entire leg, making your kick that much more powerful.







, Now that you’ve set a great foundation, it’s time to make contact. Extend your leg straight out. Make contact with your target. Front kicks can be used for lower, core, and upper body targets. This means that you’ll need to have the flexibility to kick higher up in the air.







, This is key. Since the ball or heel of your foot is the hardest part of your foot, it is where you should make contact. If you kick with your toes, you’re likely to break them.

A side kick is not appropriate if your target is located in any other place. Before carrying out this kick, place your body in the correct position.







, If you draw an imaginary line from your opponent to yourself, your foot should run perpendicularly. The key to this kick is a solid base. You must be able to balance your body as you perform the Yop Chagi. Most Taekwondo masters rotate their foot into this position as they are kicking. Doing so allows you to execute the kick quickly.







, Bend your knee so that it raises towards your torso. This motion gives you the ability to extend your leg farther, faster. It will add much needed force to your kick.







, While you extend your leg out, your hips should open up as well, which will add some momentum to your kick.

It is important to have a fixed position to target for this kick even though it uses a more circular movement than the side kick.







, This is the same as the side kick. By bringing your knee up and to your torso, you are packing more strength behind your kick. This is the same as a side kick.







, Be sure to maintain your balance in this phase or you’ll fall over and your kick will fail. Whereas the sidekick extends straight to the target at this point, the hook kick moves forward (in the direction of your toes). You need to do this in order to pull back in the next step, thus making the hooking motion.







, Complete the hooking motion. This is a great place to reevaluate your target. If your opponent has moved since you initiated the kick, now you can lower, raise, or shift your kick.







, Depending on the position of your opponent during this phase, you’ll want to hit with a safe part of your foot. The heel is the best, but the sole of your foot works too. Do not kick with your toes or the top of your foot.

Bring your knee up to your chest.,

Use your toes to balance yourself.,
Hit with the heel of your foot.",How to Execute the Major Kicks in Taekwondo4," In order to get in the correct position, you’ll need to have your back to your opponent. If your sparring partner has gotten behind you, this is an ideal move or if you want to surprise him, you can shift your back to him. You don’t want your target to be directly behind your back. You’ll need to extend your leg to its fullest length for this kick. So make sure that you can do this with both legs.







, As with every kick, this is to give you more room to extend, thus adding momentum to your kick. This should be done quickly so as to not alert your target as to your intentions. 







, Drive your heel forward to your target. Back kicks don’t work for targets higher in the air. Our bodies simply don’t bend this way, so extend your leg to the middle or lower section of your opponent. 







, If done correctly, your weight will shift naturally to your toes. In which case, make sure that you are prepared for this. You don’t want to tumble over.








, This will be the first part of your foot to make contact anyways since you are kicking behind you. As always, avoid hitting the target with any other part of your foot.

, Most instructors will tell you to turn your standing foot inwards towards your core when beginning your round house kick. The power of the roundhouse kick comes from the rotation movement. This occurs on the ball of your foot. It takes great balance. Practice this spin several times before attempting your first round house kick.







, This movement will be very quick and will give your kick a little more power. As soon as you’ve pulled your leg in, you’ll release it.








, The angle at which you extend your leg will be determined by the height of your target. This will be done in the middle of your spin.







, Be sure not to make contact with your toes. Doing so will hurt you more than your opponent.








Do not use your heel to make contact.

Bending your knees and lowering your body allows you to balance yourself better.
Remember to breathe slowly and evenly.Avoid the tendency to hold your breath in an effort to move silently, because it will end up having the opposite effect.;
, After you’ve carefully shifted your weight to your right leg, slowly raise your left foot. Use your right leg to maintain your balance as you lift your foot as slowly as you possibly can.Once you’ve raised your left leg so that your knee is approximately at waist level, stop.
Continue using your right leg and the placement of your hands to help you balance on one foot.

, Do this as slowly as your balance will allow. Keep extending until your left foot is hovering over the ground at approximately a stride’s length in front of you.As you steadily extend your left foot forward, gradually begin shifting some of the weight from your right leg to your left.
When you begin shifting your weight to your left leg in mid-air, your right leg will require a little more effort and muscle control to keep you balanced.

, Using slow, measured movements, start lowering your foot to the ground. Continue to slowly shift a little more weight from the right to the left leg. Point your left toes slightly downward in anticipation of making contact with the ground.Keep your knees loose through the entire process and try as hard as you can not to stiffen them.
Maintain balance and control by allowing your body weight to sink and be carried by deeply flexed knees.

, No other toe should be touching the ground yet. Once you’ve steadied yourself, shift a little more weight to the left, controlling your balance with the pinky toe and your right leg., You will start with the smallest toes first. As your slowly and silently put down another toe, shift a little more of your weight to the left.


Continue shifting your weight and controlling your balance as you touch down the other left toes, ending with your big toe.All of your left toes should be touching the ground at this point. No other part of your foot should be on the ground.

, You are now in mid-stride, with your weight evenly distributed to the left toes and right leg. Start shifting more weight to your left toes while you simultaneously begin to flex your right foot forward, bringing your heel off the ground in preparation of the next stride.


Try to keep your movements as controlled as possible while you’re in mid-stride.

, As you raise your right leg, simultaneously start to slowly roll your left foot down from the toes to put weight on the ball of your left foot. Continue to lower until your heel is finally touching the ground.You are now halfway through the next stride. Almost all of your weight should now be shifted onto your left side, with your right leg in mid-air.
This is the hardest part, since it requires the most balance and muscle control.

, Keep extending until your right foot is hovering over the ground at approximately a stride’s length in front of you. Move as slowly as you can.As you gradually extend your right foot forward, begin shifting some of the weight from your left leg to your right.
Maintain muscle control and balance as you shift your weight.

, Touch down first with your right pinky toe. Slowly begin touching your other toes to the ground, going from smallest to largest. As you bring your toes down, transfer more weight to your right foot.


You should now be balanced evenly. Your right foot is forward with only the toes touching the ground. Your left foot is back, with your toes and heel on the ground.
Hands should still be facing with the palms down, a few inches in front of you, at about waist height.

, Be as silent as possible and keep using the same method of moving from one tip toe to the next, shifting your weight back and forth and maintaining your balance as you do so.

There are many articles that tell you ninja clothes (shinobi shozoku) should be tight-fitting to avoid making noise. The clothes should instead fit your body in a loose style.;
, You will need clothes that fit the environment around you. The idea of camouflage is to distort your shape so you won’t be easily identified. Matching the people around you has become important for the modern ninja. This sometimes means studying the people around you and being able to easily adapt.


Being unnoticed is important for a ninja.
Your nightclothes should be dark blue and comfortable. Consider wearing a keikogi, a martial arts training top, and a hakama, or loose fitting formal pants. The bottom parts of your hakama should be tucked into your tabi (ninja boots) and tied with a string for each foot., You don't need to spend a lot of money at a specialty store for the authentic look. A traditional wardrobe doesn't create a ninja. Soccer sweat pants can be a great substitute for pants. Pair that with a dark blue t-shirt or turtleneck, a dark ski mask and you’re a modern ninja.

"
Slow down and control every movement.Practice controlled movements of all kinds whenever you have free time if you want to move like a ninja.,
Stick to the shadows when you’re on the move.As you move slowly and stealthily around, make every effort to stay silent and in the darkest shadows.,
Maintain slow, rhythmic breathing at all times.,
Use any unforeseen noises to your advantage.",How to Move Like a Ninja2," The idea in ninja training was to move so slowly and so quietly that your movements wouldn’t catch the enemy’s eye, even as you approached them.


If you see anyone while moving around, especially if they are facing in your direction, freeze in place immediately to consider your next move.
Silence and slow, controlled movements were at the heart of all ninja techniques and required a lot of patience and practice., Be mindful of light sources so you can navigate the shadows adequately.Ninjas almost always moved under the cover of night, but there were still other light sources to contend with, such as moonlight, enemy camp fires and so on.
You will have many other light sources to contend with in the modern world, so keep that in mind as you practice moving in shadows.

, Remember to breathe along with your movement. Unconsciously holding your breath can produce muscle tension, possibly resulting in a gasping release of breath if you are startled or accidentally unbalanced. Controlled breathing also keeps you calm and focused.


Practice rhythmic breathing with simple breathing exercises.
Consider practicing yoga, which emphasizes controlled breathing during movement.
Yoga will also make you more flexible and help you move more fluidly.

, Take advantage of any natural noise happening in your environment. Planning movements that may cause noise to coincide with the natural sounds.This way, any movement you make that makes a sound will be drowned out by the natural noise.


You can also create false sounds to distract the enemy or divert their attention.For instance, try throwing a rock in the opposite direction of where you’re hiding in the dark. It will make a sound, causing your enemy to look away from you and in the direction of the noise.
The ninja called this “Joei-on jutsu” – the art of concealing sound."
"
Blend in with your environment.,
Hold positions for long periods of time.,
Hide in available bodies of water.,
Be as patient as possible.",How to Move Like a Ninja3," When forced to stop, use the silhouettes of your surroundings to blend into and conceal yourself. The objects can be anything – trees, rocks, furniture, shrubs, etc. Simply freeze in place in a position that blends you into the natural contours and shadows of the elements around you.Blending in and hiding behind objects were common tactics, along with hiding inside objects, such as ditches and holes.Make use of any natural or many-made objects in your environment in any way that you can., Occasionally you will be forced to stop moving to avoid being seen, so you will need to learn to hold yourself perfectly still for long periods of time. By freezing in place, you are attempting to make yourself invisible to the eyes of the enemy.One method the ninja used was called “Uzura-gakure” (hiding like a quail). It involved crouching very low to the ground with your arms in front of your face and being absolutely still.When there was nothing to hide behind, the ninja would employ “Uzura-gakure” to try to blend into the darkness and be as still as a stone.
This skill takes a lot of practice and muscle control, so yoga would be an extremely way to train for this.

, Water concealment was a large part of ninja training and they would hide in lakes, ponds and streams whenever forced to. Be prepared to control your breathing to the point that you can stay underwater for longer than usual amounts of time.


Make use of reeds, bamboo shoots or any other devices on hand to help you breathe when forced to be in the water for long periods of time., The art of concealment calls for extreme patience. Speed of travel was not emphasized unless the mission specifically called for it. Take as much time as you can. Impatience and hasty movements are two of the greatest dangers to anyone trying to conceal themselves.


Wait for the perfect moment before trying to move, advance or escape.
The ninja also used controlled breathing to help them maintain patience and composure in stressful hiding situations.

Practice Nuki Ashi.,
Use Yoko Aruki or sidewalk.,
Practice Ko Ashi or tiger feet.,
Try crouching.,
Practice crawling.,
Use other stealth tips.",How to Learn Ninja Techniques2," This is one of the techniques of Shinobi Aruki. It is very useful for moving across creaky floor boards and the like. Start in a low crouching position with your arms extended for balance. Put most of your weight on the front leg. Move the back leg from the rear and swing it close to your other leg so it barely touches at the ankles.Extend the moving leg forward and use it to feel for any creaky floor boards. Then starting from the outer edge of your foot, ease your weight onto that leg.

, This is a walking technique used to travel along walls and through tight spaces. Yoko aruki starts with one's back against the wall. Move the rear leg in the direction of travel. Bend the knees deeply when doing this. Once in this position, move the other leg sideways in front of the other leg and in the direction of travel. This movement should be smooth., This is a good technique for walking through high brush or water. First, lift your front leg straight out of the brush. Slide your foot over the spot in which you intend to step. Point your foot straight down and step into the brush. After the foot has reached the ground return it to a normal position., Perhaps the best way to move about, crouching allows less of you to be seen while moving.

, Excellent for visual concealment, the crawl is good for crossing soft grass and clean surfaces. The crawl is not good for crossing anything noisy such as hard grass, leaves, and rocky terrain.

, When you're about to turn around a corner, listen for footsteps or talking around or behind a wall. If you're skilled enough, you can tell which direction they are facing by listening to them. Be sure to press your weight against the wall, and crouch as low as you can to peer around the corner.


The lower you are, the less chance they'll see you.
When ascending stairs, if they are creaky, walk on the side of them, closest to the wall.

Learn Jujutsu.,
Discover ninjutsu organizations.,
Learn from a trainer.",How to Learn Ninja Techniques3," Jujutsu is a great foundation to martial arts practice because the fighting style relies on balance. Much of the Jujutsu takes your opponent's strength and uses it against them.If you belong to a Jujutsu school, you'll begin with the elementary throws and grapples. One of the first skills you learn is to relax during training.This enables you to train longer without becoming exhausted and also is good preparation to becoming a ninja.


The core of Jujutsu is fighting without weapons.

, Some larger cities have ninjutsu schools that are open for willing patrons. This is the best way to learn the true techniques a of ninja’s fighting style. The core idea of ninjutsu is stealth.


A modern fictitious ninja who incorporates this fighting style is Batman.

, Although knowing a traditional Japanese style of fighting is preferred, receiving any type of martial art training will help. You can always adapt the ways of your martial arts style into a stealth based style.


You can also seek out further training after receiving a basic martial arts training.

Use throwing spears.,
Throw ninja stars.,
Wield a sword.,
Use Smoke Bombs.",How to Learn Ninja Techniques4," Hold the Bo-Shuriken in your hand with the point facing the same direction as your fingers. Hold it in place by your middle and index finger. Tuck your thumb over it to keep the bottom half secure. Point your arm that is not holding it towards the target. Then position your foot on the side of that hand in front of the target. Raise the hand that's holding the bo-shuriken next to your head.


Bring the BS holding hand straight down, accelerating as you bring it down. Make sure it's powerful enough so that it slips out of your hand.
Try not to be too powerful or you won't have much accuracy., Hold the shuriken in your hand by gripping the outside of a point. Reach around your body to where you back pocket would be, and then pull your arm around and let your wrist snap forward. This will take practice at first. Only worry about the accuracy and not the power, distance, or looking cool.

, There are five basic postures of wielding a sword in a ninja style.


Jodan no Kamae. This entails holding the sword overhead at a 45 degree angle.
Seigan no Kamae. This technique places the sword handle at hip level with the tip aiming at your adversary's eyes.
Chudan no Kamae. For this, the sword is held at your center, above waist level with the tip pointing to your adversary's stomach.
Hasso no kamae. Have the sword at your side in a manner similar to a baseball bat.
Gedan no kamae. The sword handle will be at your hip’s height so the tip aims towards the opponent's feet., Smoke bombs are a classic get away technique. You can either make your own smoke bombs or buy them at a store. Ask a local marital artist if they could help you find this type of smoke bomb.

Remove the cap and plastic ring from a plastic bottle.,
Turn the plastic ring inside-out.,
Slip the cap into the ring.,
Readjust the spikes as needed.,
Admire your work.",How to Make a Ninja Star1," The cap will form the base of your ninja star and the ring that the cap was previously attached to will form the points of the star.

Choose a plastic bottle with a plastic cap connected to a plastic ring. Sports drink bottles work best because they have the largest openings and, as such, have the largest caps. You could also use water bottles, tea bottles, or pop bottles.



 


Twist the cap off as usually, breaking it from the attached plastic ring in the process.






It may take a little effort to get the plastic ring off since they are not meant to come off easily. Dig your nails beneath one side of the ring and pull upward as far as you can. Switch to the opposite side and do the same. The ring should lift a little higher the second time. Continue wriggling the ring up in this manner until it passes over the threads and off the bottle completely.





;
, Use your fingers to flip the plastic ring so that all of the ""spikes"" or pointed grips face the outside.

Push on the inside of the ring on one side using your thumb.






Once you manage to flip the inside out in one spot, it should be easier to gradually ease the rest of the inside outward.






Note that the pointed grips may ""bite"" or pinch into you slightly as you work. Typically speaking, though, the edges are not sharp enough to cause any cuts or wounds.







, Wiggle the ring over the outside of the cap until it fits snug around the center of the cap's perimeter.

Rest the ring on the top of the cap, aligning the opening of the ring with the top of the cap as accurately as possible.






Use your thumb to push down on one side of the ring until it slips over the edge of the cap.






Gradually ease your thumb around the perimeter of the ring to slide the rest of it onto the cap.






Once on, ease the ring to the center of the cap by sliding it down with your thumb and forefinger.







, All the spikes on the ring should stick out.

Carefully run your thumb along the spikes in the opposite direction of the spikes. Doing so should lift the spikes nearly straight up.






Note that you may scratch your thumb in the process of doing this.







, Your ninja star is now complete.


Do not throw this ninja star at animals or people. It is not a particularly dangerous version, but you can still cause damage if you throw this at an animal or human.

Finish up.",How to Make a Flail," Don't make it too tight as the tighter it is, the heavier it gets, and a heavy mace ball is dangerous.;
,,, Wrap it in different spots and wrap at least 4 times. With a varied wrap like this, the ball will not come off the string. Tie a knot after each wrap.

, If you are using plastic chain, thread each wrap of the string through the link as shown. Every wrap should go through the chain. This is both for strength and for safety. If you are not using a chain, then create a hoop with these string lengths. This way you can run another series of strings through it and attach them to the handle of the flail.

, Complete the shape and size of the ball head by taping it over completely. Don't be stingy with the tape; the more tape you use, the stronger it will be. Make it as reasonably smooth as you can and shape it as much like a ball as you can. You will be painting this surface, so the smoother the better.

, The pointy cones will attach to the mace ball.


Cut a circle.






Fold the circle in half.






Curl the half circle forming a cone.






Make 8 to 16 cones depending on the size of the flail.







, Tape the cones to the head of the flail. Use a nice random pattern and tape them down nice and secure so they don't come off. do not fill them with newspaper. We do not want them to be overly strong. It is better that the collapse or get crushed rather than cause damage or injury to someone.

, Drill a hole in the end of the flail handle as shown. (Through the side at around half inch from the end. This is for strength and safety.


Pass the string through it several times and with each pass put it through the chain. If you are not using a chain, then just make each pass into a loop. Tie several lengths of string to this loop and about 15 to 18 inches (38.1 to 45.7 cm) further along, you tie all the strings to the loop in the mace ball.







, The flail is complete and ready to be painted.

Cut the handles off four plastic knives.,
Tape two knife blades together.,
Tape the other two blades together.,
Attach both sets of blades.,
Trim the tips of each blade, if desired.,
Check over your finished product.",How to Make a Ninja Star2," Use scissors or a sharp utility knife to cut the handle portions off of four plastic picnic-style knives.


Leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the handle attached to the serrated blade portion of the knife. This small section of handle will be used to overlap the blades together later in the process.






Discard the rest of the handle.







, Position two of the plastic blades together, allowing them to overlap on the remaining section of handle. Secure them together with clear packing tape.


Note that the blades should face opposite directions. One blade should face left, while the other should face right.







, Tape the other two blades together in the same way you taped the first two.


Overlap the blades at the remaining handle.






Note that one blade should face left while the other faces right.






Tape securely using clear packing tape.







, Place the center of one set over the center of the other set. Tape the sets together using clear packing tape.


Note that all four blades should appear to travel in the same direction.







, Use sharp scissors or a utility knife to shave off plastic at each tip into a 1 inch (2.5 cm) point.

This is not essential, but adding a point to each tip will make allow the ninja star to stick into cardboard and foam targets more effectively.

, Wiggle the flat side of each blade around with your thumb and forefinger. Add more tape, as needed, to secure each blade and prevent it from moving around.

This step completes your ninja star.
Only throw the star at non-living targets like cardboard and foam. Never throw it at people or animals.

Place two X-acto blades next to each other.,
Carefully apply double-sided tape.,
Arrange the other two blades on top of the tape.,
Strengthen the ninja star with more tape.,
Use with caution.",How to Make a Ninja Star3," Line up two blades so that the bases are side by side. Note that the sharp edge of the blades should face away from each other.

The utility blades you use need to be for a ""pen"" style utility knife.

, Place a square of double-sided tape over the bases of the two blades to temporarily secure them together.

In the absence of double-sided tape, you could use a folded piece of single-sided tape, instead. Fold the piece of tape with the non-sticky side facing in until the two ends meet. Overlap enough of the tape so that the sticky side from one end sticks to the non-sticky side of the other, forming a loop.

, Place the bases of the other two blades on top of the tape. Press lightly to secure in place.


Note that the sharp sides of the blade should be facing out, and each sharp edge should appear to travel in the same direction.






These last two blades should be perpendicular to the first two.







, Wrap normal tape around the center of the ninja star to secure the blades in place.


Avoid letting the tape cover any part of the blades other than the bases.






Cut a piece of tape three times as long as your star's center. Cut into 1/3 of the length and 1/2 of the width on the top right corner. Repeat the cut on the bottom right corner.






Place the solid center over the front center of the ninja star. Carefully fold the tape onto the back of the star.






Repeat with another piece of tape, placing it on the opposite side of the star.







, Since this ninja star is made with actual blades, it can cause severe injuries if thrown at people or animals. Only throw your ninja star at bulletin boards, cardboard targets, foam targets, and other non-living objects.

Practice Gi (integrity.),
Practice Yuuki (courage.),
Practice Jin (kindness; benevolence.),
Practice Rei (politeness; etiquette.),
Practice Makoto (honesty.),
Practice Meiyo (honor.),
Practice Chugi (loyalty.)",How to Be a Samurai1," Traditionally, samurai lived according to the moral and ethical code known as Bushido. While the samurai are gone, the central virtues of the Bushido code still describe an honorable, moral life that is perfectly possible to follow today. The first of these virtues is integrity.A samurai always strives to do the right thing, even (and especially) when it's hard. When presented with difficult decisions, the samurai chooses the path that is best for the greater good — even if it's not the best for him.



Modern example: Kate accidentally makes an error when she's applying for college online: instead of giving her correct high school grade point average of 3.5, she absentmindedly types in 3.9. Kate later spots her mistake, but only after she's submitted her application. Though the mistake makes her look like a better candidate and she's pretty sure it will go unnoticed, she emails the department of admissions about her mistake anyway to ensure that she is judged fairly and to preserve her honor.;
, Samurai don't run away from doing difficult (even impossible) things. Even in the face of grave circumstances and unlikely odds, they present a strong face and do their best to perform their duty. Note that this doesn't mean that samurai never get scared. Everyone gets scared. Rather, when samurai get scared, they still do their best to complete the task at hand.



Modern example: Joe is scared to go back out on the football field after halftime — his team is down by four touchdowns, the players on the other team insult him after every play, and he knows his coach will embarrass him in the locker room about the interceptions he threw in the first quarter. After a brief moment of reflection, Joe returns to the field with his head held high — in his mind, his goal is now to have the best second half possible in spite of his fear and the difficult odds he faces.

, While samurai are remembered today mainly for their fierceness on the battlefield, in their day-to-day lives, they were anything but fierce. The ideal samurai was a warm (though always dignified) companion to friends, family, and strangers alike, treating the people he met with love and compassion. Today, you can follow the virtue of Jin by doing your best to live a life full of human kindness — even when you run into people who may not especially deserve it.



Modern example: The new kid at school is, by all accounts, a weirdo — he doesn't talk to anyone, he doesn't seem to have good hygiene, and he acts nervously whenever he has to speak in front of others. Shawn sees him sitting alone in a corner of the cafeteria and decides to sit next to him and make an effort to start a conversation. Whether the new kid turns out to be a kind soul who was simply shy or someone who's just as odd as everyone has made him out to be, he still deserves the same compassion that Shawn would give any of his friends.

, Believe it or not, samurai strove to be perfect gentlemen in their day-to-day interactions just as much as they strove to be deadly on the battlefield. This virtue differs from Jin (kindness) in that it describes a precise set of social customs and behaviors that constituted ""politeness"" in Japan at the time. While it may be impractical today to participate in tea ceremonies from Japan's feudal period, for instance, you can still practice Rei by acting according to the modern notions of politeness and etiquette for gentlemen and gentlewomen.



Modern example: For some reason, the old cashier at the grocery store just doesn't like Kim. Every time she goes through his checkout line, he scowls and says nothing more than a terse ""Do you want anything else?"" She isn't sure whether he doesn't like the way she looks, whether she said something he disagreed with in the past, or whether the problem is something else entirely. In spite of this, she resolves to greet him with a smile and some polite conversation every day. Maybe, one day, he'll eventually learn to give her the same.

, A samurai was expected to be honest in both word and action at all times. The Bushido code dictated that he should always tell the truth, should never knowingly lie, and should never intentionally act in a way to cheat or deceive another person. To do this is to show respect for the laws of the universe nature and the cosmos never act dishonestly, so neither should the samurai.Modern example: After work, one of Sandeep's office coworkers tells him that he will be getting a call from his girlfriend, whom Sandeep has met. He asks Sandeep to say that the two of them went to the local bar for drinks last night and stayed there until closing time. Sandeep, who was at home with his family, apologizes and politely refuses. His acquaintance becomes frustrated, but Sandeep doesn't give in — he won't knowingly lie, especially not to help someone get away with something immoral.

, A samurai valued his honor above almost everything else, even sometimes his life. Samurai made lifelong efforts to be admired and praised for their strength, competence, and virtue. To be disgraced was usually out of the question: when put in a position where he was faced with a major failure (like, for instance, if he had lost an important battle for his daimyo, lord), it was not uncommon for a samurai to commit suicide by seppuku (ritual disembowelment) to preserve his honor.Though practices like seppuku are fairly extreme for the modern world, people who want to live like a samurai should be mindful of how the way they live affects their honor and reputation.



Modern example: When she gets home from class one day, Isabella finds an invitation to a costume party at the prestigious sorority she's been trying to make friends at. Though she's at first overjoyed, her hopes are dashed when she sees that the organizers of the party have chosen a tasteless racist theme for the party. Though she's dying to make inroads in her college's Greek community, Isabella decides to skip the party for another one at a less-prestigious sorority — she would never want her reputation tarnished by being associated with such trash.

, The samurai were nothing if not loyal to their masters, their clans, and their subjects. A samurai was expected to follow the orders of his daimyo with absolute obedience. Samurai even signed ""blood contracts"" with their daimyo that swore the loyalty of their entire bloodline to the bloodline of the lord.While, once again, this sort of extreme loyalty is out of place in the modern era, it's still possible to practice Chuugi by sticking by the people in your life that you are honor-bound to in times of difficulty, like your friends, your family, and the people who are dependent on you.



Modern example: Tim and his son have always had a difficult relationship. Whenever Tim tries to help his son make the right decisions in life, the two of them always seem to end up in a heated argument. Now, his son is marrying a woman that Tim doesn't care for at all. Despite his extreme reservations, Tim resolves to be there by his son's side at his wedding — he's his son, and he'll love him no matter what.

Do: Chest armor plate made from iron and/or leather. In later centuries, it was common for samurai to use European-style cuirasses as these provided better protection against gunshots.Kusazuri: Iron or leather plates hanging from the waist like a skirt to protect the waist and upper legs.

Sode: Shoulder pads made from iron or leather plates.
If you are looking for authentic Japanese armor, try browsing the sites of antique armor dealers or re-creators. Beware — these rare collectibles can be quite expensive.On the other hand, if you are simply looking for a costume, it will probably easiest to sew or glue thin metal pieces to an old, sturdy shirt. See How to Make Costume Armor for more information.

, A samurai's unmistakable helmet instantly set him apart from the people around him on the battlefield. The characteristic kabuto samurai helmet typically had a visor, a decorative emblem in the front, and a low brim (called a shikoro) that extended down from the edges of the helmet to the samurai's neck in rows of interlocking metal strips designed to protect the samurai's neck. Helmets also generally had a small hole directly in the top to hold the samurai's ""top-knot"" hairstyle.If you're making your own helmet, a good idea is to start with an old bike helmet as your base. Coat the helmet in papier-mâché, then paint it a fierce color like black, red, brown, or bronze. Cut a decorative emblem out of cardboard or sheet metal and glue it to the front. Finally, cut many thin strips of paper or metal and hang them from the back and sides of the helmet in a half-circle.

, Imagine the terror of a samurai's enemy when he turns to face his attacker and stares into the cold eyes of an iron face frozen in an angry grimace! Samurais generally wore masks into battle not just to protect their face and neck but also to intimidate their opponents it was not at all uncommon for a samurai's Mempo mask to be in the shape of something terrifying like a snarling demon.While real mempo masks were usually made from metal or leather, you can make your own from plaster. Simply form it around your neck and chin up to your cheeks and paint it the color of your armor once it dries. See How to Make a Plaster Mask for more information.

, Outside of battle, samurai often wore a traditional outfit which consisted of a Kimono (a robe which many Westerners are today familiar with) and a Hakama. The hakama is a type of pants or trousers that hang loosely about the legs and are worn over the kimono. Hakama are secured in place with several knots tied about the waist and typically have five pleats on the front: three to the right and two to the left.


While kimonos and hakama aren't sold in most modern clothing stores, it's not usually hard to find them online simply browse retail sites like Amazon and Ebay for deals.
See this guide for instructions on tying a hakama.

, Samurai men typically had long hair which they wore up in a tight bun on top of their head.This bun was sometimes tied in place with decorative fabric or bands, though a simple string was most common. See How to Make a Top Knot Bun for steps on tying your hair in a similar modern hairstyle.


If you're very serious about achieving the samurai look, try shaving your pate (the top of your head) and leaving your hair only on the sides and back, which you can then tie in a small bun. This traditional hairstyle was once a sign of high status in Japanese society, but it requires lots of confidence to pull off today.

Fight only for honorable causes.,
Condition your body.,
Learn a martial art.,
Consider learning to fight with traditional samurai weapons.,
Alternatively, learn to fight with modern weapons.,
Fight without fear of defeat.",How to Be a Samurai3," Legendary samurai like Minamoto no Tametomo, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and others earned their reputation as powerful, fearless, and cunning fighters through many years of excellence on the battlefield.However, this excellence never came at the expense of a samurai's honor. Samurai never sully their reputation (or, more importantly, the reputation of the people they are loyal to) by using their great power for cowardly, selfish, or shameful reasons. Below are just a few examples of when and when not to fight.



Good reasons for a samurai to fight:
Protecting innocents from danger
Trying to prevent a dangerous situation from occurring
Defending the honor of a friend or family member

Bad reasons for a samurai to fight:
Beating people up for their money
Defeating someone else to make yourself feel better
Picking fights over petty grudges and slights

, To be able to fight like a samurai, you must start by reaching for the raw materials of strength and endurance. Samurai cannot fight to defend their loved ones if they are too weak or out of shape to offer much of a challenge. Ideally, samurai should practice excellent physical fitness habits, exercising at least several times per week to build muscle strength and cardiovascular endurance. In addition, samurai should closely monitor their diet and work towards a lean but powerful physique.


For a comprehensive fitness guide, see How to Exercise. Here, you'll find tips on aerobic exercise, strength-building routines, and much more.
For dieting tips, see How to Diet. In general, aspiring samurai will want to eat a diet that is rich in protein, whole grains, and healthy fats while maintaining a calorie intake that will put them on course for a lean physique.

, An ideal samurai didn't need weapons to fight — he would be willing and able to fight armed and armored enemies with his bare hands if needed. Learning a martial art will make you a formidable opponent even when unarmed. In addition, the inner strength and self-discipline that you'll develop from striving for excellence in your fighting style will serve you well in difficult and dangerous situations.


Traditionally, samurai were expected to learn a form of the martial art today known as jiu jitsu as part of their training.This fighting style emphasized throws, grapples, and pins, which allowed samurai to effectively defeat armored opponents against whom punches and kicks wouldn't be effective.
Today, in addition to jiu jitsu, a wide range of martial arts from a variety of cultures around the world are available to those who want to learn them. These include:
Boxing
Kickboxing
Taekwondo
Krav maga
Judo

, Samurai were proficient killers with a wide variety of weapons. These include the naginata, a long poleaxe or spear, the bow, and the famous katana sword. While these weapons may be ineffective (or at the very least impractical) in most modern settings, you may still want to learn how to use them for ceremonial or traditional purposes.


A good resource for those looking to find out more about the naginata is the U.S. Naginata Federation website.This site has information about various naginata fighting styles as well as a directory of links to the webpages of various regional naginata associations.
The Japanese art of archery is called Kyudo. A good place to start learning about Kyudo is at the website of the International Kyudo Federation.Here, you'll find information on equipment, techniques, upcoming events and seminars, and more.
Unfortunately, in most Western countries, it's much easier to find organizations dedicated to European sword fighting than it is to find katana-centered organizations. Various regional organizations are your best bet here for those in the U.S. and Canada, try starting with the Classic Katana Owners of North America website.

, The modern battlefield is a very different one than the warriors of feudal Japan were familiar with the prevalence of firearms, artillery, air power, and many more modern inventions, a samurai's traditional weapons aren't often effective today. However, a modern-day samurai can still adopt the devotion and focus of samurais from the past when learning to fight with modern-day weapons.


The topic of how to fight in the modern world is unfortunately too broad for the scope of this article. However, when it comes to guns, it's important to be clear that you should not buy or start carrying a gun until you are absolutely sure that you can use and store it safely (and have the required legal certification to do so.) See How to Handle a Firearm Safely for more information.
Serious about learning how to fight in the modern age? Try joining your country's armed services or national guard. Here, you'll learn up-to-date tactics for how to function effectively in modern battlefield situations, including how to use and maintain firearms.

, The most respected samurai warriors were said to fight as if they were already dead that is, they fought fearlessly because it truly did not make a difference to them whether they lived or died in battle. Today, it's not considered wise or honorable to have little regard for your own life. However, you can still apply the spirit of this samurai principle by fighting without fear of the consequences you may suffer. In other words, when you fight, try not to worry about the danger to yourself or the likelihood of failure. Instead, focus totally on your goal: victory.


This, of course, only applies when fighting for honorable purposes. This advice is not meant to encourage aspiring samurais to have no regard for the law or the fundamental principles of common decency.

Decide upon a series of ideas, morals, and philosophies that you truly can live by.",How to Be a Ninja1," Educate yourself on the history of ninja. For example, you might want to read Masaaki Hatsumi's book, Secrets From The Ninja Grandmaster. Most ninja were freelance mercenaries who used their skills to support their families. Some ninja, however, were employed by lords and government officials. And some worked solely for their own clan. The ninja lifestyle was diverse. You need to direct your lifestyle accordingly.;
"
"
Get fit.,
Get your outfit.,
Go to a store and get a plastic samurai sword.,
Walk silently around the house and practice rolling your feet.

,
When you get hungry, eat sushi or other traditional Japanese foods.,
Practice karate, kung fu, judo or any other martial arts.,
Form a ninja gang with friends but make sure that no one tells anyone at all about your ninja-ness.

,
Stay away from pirates.",How to Be a Kid Ninja," Go swimming and practice swimming silently. Stretch, do gymnastics, and anything which could keep you fit. Make sure that you exercise lots so you can move around quickly.;
, All you need is a dark colored outfit that has long sleeves, long pants,and a mask. For a mask, simply cut a strip of dark colored fabric and cut eye holes. You can make an outfit like that but white if it snows a lot where you live.

, If you want to go all out, buy a real one. If you want, carve one with wood.

,, Also eat fruits and veggies and lots of water or milk so you stay healthy. Feel free to drink soft drinks or take out but no more than once a week. Have no more than two cookies or pieces of candy a day and keep exercising.

, Also practice fencing or flicking playing cards (helpful for throwing ninja stars).

,, These are the worst enemy of a ninja.

"
Silence is a valuable asset.,
Never publicize that you are a ninja.",How to Be a Ninja2," One's decision to live by ninjutsu discipline is not and should not be public knowledge. Your first responsibility is to learn and practice ninjutsu in secrecy, and privately.

, A ninja must be able to function as a spy, which means that you cannot reveal your status as an aspiring ninja, or else no one will trust you. Do not dress like the stereotypical ninja. The black outfits that most people associate with ninja are a construct of Kabuki theater (although this has not been proven), in which prop handlers were disguised as ninja characters (who always wore black to minimize their presence while moving props on stage).When you do wear ninja clothes, the idea is to never let anyone see you in them.

Learn how to move stealthy.,
Learn how to fight.,
Know how to escape.,
Learn to control people by words and non-violent influence.,
Master self-control.",How to Be a Ninja3," Tabi boots are great for this, try to roll your feet from heel to toe. Become adept at social and physical invisibility and silence. Walk silently. Learn the appropriate clothes for the appropriate times. Do not stand out or draw attention to yourself in any way. Sometimes that may mean being sociable and friendly because in the modern world, a person who sits quietly in the corner arouses suspicion and is carefully watched.

, Learning a martial art will be helpful in this aspect. While ninjas typically tried to avoid open combat, at times it is necessary.

, No matter where you are, know how to get out of the situation as quickly and as anonymously (unseen) as possible. This is a critical skill for a ninja, especially when performing missions. Historically, smoke bombs and firecrackers were used to create diversions, but you will have to devise more subtle techniques, like starting a fight or switching off the lights. When you enter a room, always be aware of every potential (possible) exit, and have several plans in place for how you can create a diversion if necessary. As you escape, strive to leave no evidence behind, like clothes, weapons or fingerprints (wear gloves?). One way that ninja accomplished this in the past was with ashiaro, or wooden pads worn on their bottom of their footwear and carved to look like an animal's paw or a child's foot so that the ninja's footprints would not be noticed, this was also used in WWII.

, Use people's desires, needs and wants as a leverage against them. Humans need security, wealth, pride, strength and to have their wants and needs satisfied. This is a key ability in most if not all events.

, A true Ninja is a master of his/her environment, which consequently requires one to be in control of one's self. To master one's self, learn to: cut emotions out of the decision making, engage in rational and logical thinking no matter what the situation is, make tactical decisions that may upset one's ego, finding the flow of situations/problems and one's place with in them, make decisions for one's own situations as if giving someone else advice. Applying these tips to every day life is a must, as it stands in the way of the mastery of one's self. If one cannot master self, one cannot master others, and their surroundings. Example: Engaging in physical combat due to provocation knowing one can defeat the threat may not be the best of interests for the big picture. Walking away while ridicule may hurt one's ego, but will keep one in the clear of the public's eye from things to come.

Exercise and maintain a ninja body.,
Feed your mind.,
Practice meditating.",How to Be a Ninja4," This does not necessarily mean becoming lean and muscular; it means building endurance, agility, strength and flexibility. Go for long distance runs, swimming, push-ups, chin-ups, crunches, squats, and make sure to stretch. Your body is a tool - as long as it can perform the functions of a ninja, it is a valuable tool.

, Ninja were often very knowledgeable. With knowledge comes power and this can help you become more resourceful and also help you blend in more easily.

, Perhaps not traditional meditation, but meditation based on complete awareness of your actions. Train your mind to be completely aware of your actions when the need arises, for prolonged periods of time.

Point your toes inward and make curves with your skates to move backwards.,
Bend your knees.,
Keep your skates shoulder-width apart.,
Push off a wall to start moving backwards.,
Angle your toes inward as you glide backwards.,
Angle your heels inward as your legs split apart.,
Use the muscles in your inner leg to pull your feet back to the center of your body.,
Curve your feet back to the outside.,
Keep your weight over your feet.,
Keep making “S” curves to move backwards smoothly.",How to Ice Skate Backwards1," The basic idea of skating backwards is easy – you push the outsides of your skates forward and out, curve them back to the center of your body and repeat. If your skates could draw on the ice they would paint curvy waves, like a child's drawing of the ocean, across the surface.


Think of each skate making an “S” shape as you move backwards;
, You cannot skate backward if you are standing up straight. Bend your knees slightly so that your butt drops closer to the ice. Your torso should be upright like you were sitting in a chair.


As you get better at it, you should be able to lift up each skate and put it back down comfortably, but at first it's to keep them on the ice.
It is easiest to use the wall or a hockey stick for balance as you start out.

, Your skates will be pointing directly ahead of you and your shoulders in a straight line over your ankles. This is your ""center"" as you skate backwards. With your skates shoulder-width apart, you have the power and strength needed Hold onto the wall with both hands for balance.

, Focus on keeping your knees bent and back straight as you get used to moving backwards. If it is more comfortable for you, lean on a hockey stick for stability.


If you don't have a hockey stick, rest your hands on your knees.

, Slowly turn your toes to face each other and you’ll feel your feet start to separate as your skates move outward. Think of skating backwards as leading with your heels -- as you toes turn inward, you heels turn out to your left and right, and the rest of your skate follows.


This does not need to be a big angle. Even slightly angling your feet will work.
This is the beginning of your ""S"" shape.

, This is usually where people feel the most uncomfortable -- your legs are splitting apart, and they will keep moving apart as long as your toes are pointing in. Turn your skates to so that your heels point back towards your body. As you do you will feel your legs coming back together.


Again, this does not need to be a large angle. Just turn your feet enough so that you feel your legs gliding back together.

, With your heels turned back to the center, use your groin muscles to bring your skates back to the middle. While you will not actually bring them this close, imagine you are trying to click your heels together.


This is the middle point of your ""S.""
Focus on keeping your knees bent – this will help you with the power and flexibility needed to control your skates.

, When you reach your starting position, feet roughly shoulder-width apart, it's time to repeat your curve. Turn your feet so that your toes face inward again, then let them start to glide back out to the side. Pull them in again and repeat -- these are the ""S"" shaped curves that you need to make.

, One of the most common mistakes people make is leaning too far forward, with their body over their toes. Focus on keeping your athletic stance the entire time. A good tip is to put your hands on your knees, using them to support you and prevent you from leaning forward.

, The “S” curve is the simplest way to move backwards on skates. Once you have some momentum, just keep repeating the “S” shape to skate backwards, working on transitioning smoothly through each part.


Start along the wall – knees bent and back straight.
Push off the wall to gain some momentum.
Turn your toes in and move your feet apart.
Pull your legs back together by turning your toes out and pulling in.
Turn your toes to the center again as your feet approach each other.
Repeat to skate backwards.

Use the “C” cut to skate backwards quickly.,
Bend your knees into an athletic position.,
Face forward with your skates shoulder-width apart.,
Take small steps backwards.,
Point your toes inward.,
Push to the right with your right foot.,
Pull your right heel back to the center.,
Straighten your right skate.,
Push forward and to the left with your left foot.,
Bring it all together with quick, powerful cuts.",How to Ice Skate Backwards2," The “C” cut, named because your skates make small C shapes in the ice, is the most common way to skate backwards with speed. Your knees are bent and your torso is upright as you alternate pushing your skates out and then arcing them smoothly back in.


Stay near a wall or lean on a hockey stick to help with your balance as you start to practice.

, Comfortably bend your knees so that you can quickly move your feet. It is difficult to spring into action with your legs straight. You should be able to easily lift you skates and balance. For a good athletic stance:


Knees bent.
Torso upright, not slouching.
Back straight.
Shoulders relaxed., Point your skates in front of you, keeping them roughly shoulder-width apart so that your can balance and skate comfortably.

, Shuffle your feet as if you were slowly backing away from something. Think of pushing yourself back with each little step, building backwards momentum.


You can also push off of a wall to get started.

, As you’re shuffling backwards, point the tips of your skates slightly towards each other. You should start to naturally move backwards faster.

, With your toes facing inwards, push out and away from your body. This is the top half of the “C” shape. Push from the middle of your blade as if you were trying to sweep something off of the floor with your skate.

, Bring your skate back to the center of your body by leading with your heel. After pushing out and to the side, turn your heel to face your left foot.Your toes will turn to face forward as you return, completing the ""C"" shape.


Your foot should return to where it started, with both skates facing forward.

, Once you've finished the ""C,"" turn your right skate so it faces forward, returning to it's starting position.

, As you return your right foot to the center, start the ""C"" shape with the opposite foot by pushing it out and forward. Circle it back around to center and repeat, alternating each foot to gain momentum.

, Skating backwards quickly is crucial for figure skaters and hockey players, so you need to practice all of the steps together to learn a smooth, speedy motion.


Start in a strong stance – knees bent, torso upright, feet facing forward.
Point one toe in as you begin to push.
Push forward and out with your skate, using the other foot for balance.
Curve your foot back to the center in the shape of a C
Repeat with the opposite foot.
Alternate feet quickly to build speed.

Use crossovers to change direction while skating backwards.,
Stand up straight, knees slightly bent.,
Bring your left foot up and over your right foot.,
Bring your right foot behind your left calf.,
Repeat this crossover motion to move horizontally.,
Start gliding backwards.,
Preform a crossover to change directions.",How to Ice Skate Backwards3," Crossover steps are a simple way to move around. You simply cross one foot over the other, letting your momentum continue moving you backwards.


For this explanation, all of the examples will be to move ‘’’right.’’’ To move left, simply switch the feet in the directions.

, Crossovers can be done moving forward or backwards, but to practice you should start from a standstill.

, Set your skate down on the ice with your legs crossed at the knee.


You should look a little like a young kid who needs to go the bathroom.

, Uncross your legs by bringing your right foot around the back of the left and setting it down on the ice. You should be back to your original standing position.

, Keep crossing over to move laterally across the ice.


Try a few in reverse if you are comfortable, putting your left leg behind your right before bringing the right foot over the left.

, You can push off the wall, make perfect “S” shapes, or speed along with “C” cuts. Gain some momentum and then relax, gliding backwards.

, As you move backwards, cross your left leg over your body then quickly uncross your legs with your right foot. When done correctly, you should shift horizontally while maintaining backwards momentum.


Think of the motion you make if when you start running to your right. Your left leg takes a step to the right and then your right leg quickly follows.

Practice Drill: Do two ""C"" cuts, one with each leg, and then one crossover. Do two more cuts, then a crossover the other direction.
’’’Practice Drill:’’’ Skate backwards around the edge of the rink, and use crossovers to change direction in the corners. Skate both clockwise and counter-clockwise to practice both directions.

Wear gloves, wrist guards, knee, or elbow pads.,
Put your hands on your waist or in front of you when you are skating.

,
Practice falling.,
Bend your knees and go into a dip position.,
Fall to the side and lean forward as you fall on the ice.,
Recover from your fall.,
Take one foot and place it between your hands.

,
Take the other foot and place it between your hands.,
Push yourself up and stand up on the ice.

",How to Fall and Recover from a Fall on Ice," These will protect you from getting hurt if you fall.;
,, Try to fall without hurting yourself. First try falling without skates and then move on to falling with skates. Try falling on different speeds with your skates on.

, If you know you are about to fall just go into a dip position.

, This will lower the chances of you getting injured.

, Turn over on your hands and knees.

,, Applying pressure to your toes and Using your toe picks will help you so you won't slide.

Have the right mindset that you can do this.,
Get properly equipped.,
Borrow ice skates rather than buy them.,
Get an instructor (coach) or join a learner's class for adults.,
Learn how to fall properly.,
Learn as much as you can about skating properly.,
Practice regularly.,
Make friends!",How to Get Started in Figure Skating As an Adult," Don't be discouraged. While many figure skaters started young, it is always possible learn something you put your willpower and effort into learning. It is important to focus on enjoying the learning first, and setting aside comparisons with the younger crew skating quickly and spinning and jumping with seeming ease. They had to begin somewhere too, and it's all about being dedicated and working towards your goal.


Don't be held back by thinking you have to be better or faster than you are from the start. You will get there, it just takes time and practice.;
, Wear the right clothing and gear. This isn't just about boosting your confidence, it's also a form of ensuring your safety and preventing injury. Things to consider include:


Wear sufficiently warm clothing. Choose trousers, slacks or figure hugging long pants that allow for free movement and provide warmth. Wearing pants will help prevent ice burn and can either prevent or minimize grazing on the ice.
Wear layered clothing. This is important so that you can dress up and down depending on how hot or cold you're feeling as you practice. Polar-fleece, merino, other wool, thermals, etc. are all good choices for preventing loss of heat and for repelling water.
Consider appropriate accessories such as gloves, a hat and leg warmers to help keep you warm.

, Ice skates are not cheap and you don't want to own a pair only to discover after lesson number one that you have changed your mind and want to take up soccer instead. Things to notice with ice skates include:


Do they fit properly? Do not wear skates that are either too small or too big, as they will cause blisters and can hamper your ability to enjoy skating.
Are the blades sharp? There is nothing less inviting than going on the ice with blunt blades.


If you love ice skating after a few sessions, then consider purchasing your own ice skates. Tips to help you choose can be found here.







, Ask a friend, family member or someone else you trust to help you learn at the beginning. Alternatively, enroll in a teen or adult class or get a one-on-one coach. In the latter case, while you will need to pay for the initial lessons, it is worth it. Putting the effort into learning the basics well at the outset will reap many rewards as you progress in your learning, as you will continue to build on these foundations and become stronger and more able as a result.


If you do have a friend or family member help you learn for free, be sure to give them gifts to acknowledge your gratitude. Alternatively, you could barter something you know how to do that they want to learn in exchange for the skating lessons.
Call the ice skating rink ahead of attending. Find out when is the best (quietest) time for beginner skaters to come and practice on the ice. If you want an instructor, ask whether they have such instructors available, or classes.

, This skill can help you to overcome fear on the ice. The reason why children learn faster is because they are not afraid to fall and through their numerous times of falling down, they learn. Adults tend to have mental blocks, thoughts about the various ways they are going to fall and injure themselves, and even imagery about broken bones. Perhaps you had even experienced a painful slip. However, the reality is that most falls do not cause serious injuries and are simply part of the learning process. Get trained in falling the right way from the very beginning, so that you can remove this fear quickly. See further How to fall and recover from a fall on ice.


If you are really afraid that you might dislocate an elbow or whatsoever, wear protective gear made especially for figure skating. You can find such gear in many figure skating stores. You should find that these protective elements will give you more confidence in attempting movements that you might be afraid to do if unprotected.
Check out How to overcome fear as a beginner figure skater for more ideas on solving worries to do with ice skating.

, If you have someone teaching you, you will likely learn faster and more correctly than struggling on your own. It can also be safer to have someone teach you, as you will learn the techniques for gliding, stopping and advancing your skills.


For more information about the skills needed to ice skate, see further How to ice skate.

, The more you practice, the faster and more agile you'll become. If you enjoy the sport, it won't be long before you get to performing spins and jumps but you must get someone to teach you these properly.


Figure skating requires strength for the jumps and flexibility for certain movements. You'll need to do physical conditioning and stretches regularly at home. You'll only see results if you do it regularly, preferably 3-4 times a week. Exercises such as sit-ups and planking can help to train your core muscles for a higher jump. Squats can strengthen your thigh muscles for a sit spin. Even if you haven't reach spinning and jumping yet, you could start training now so that you'll be able to master the jumps and spins faster next time.

, Having friends who share the same hobbies as you can help you to learn faster. Not only you can exchange skating tips with them to help each other out, you will also feel less lonely when you are at the rink. This will make your skating experience fun and exciting. Best of all, knowing that your friends are going too will act as a motivation to keep you going!"

Practice, practice, practice.",How to Figure Skate (for Beginners)," Before you get out on the ice, you need to put on your skates. Don't worry about buying your own gear right away. You can rent your gear until you're sure you want to figure skate for a long time.


Make sure you rent skates that fit. They should feel very snug but you should be able to wiggle your toes, just not too much and you don't want your skates to hurt your feet or make them tingle.
You'll also want to be sure you lace them tight enough. You should not be able to roll your ankle.;
, The very first thing you should learn as a figure skater is how to fall. You will fall a lot and it's important to know how to fall so that you don't hurt yourself. Practice falling. If you feel like you're about to fall, squat down so that when you land, your bottom or sides absorb the shock of the fall instead of something that can break or be seriously injured. Do not land with your hands out. Doing this can cause damage to your wrist, as well as let an unaware skater skate over your fingers.


You should also learn how to get up or at least get out of the way quickly. You don't want other people to run in to you.

, The next thing that you should practice as a figure skater is how to keep your knees nice and loose. When you're new to skating, you'll be unstable on your legs and your muscles will be weak, so you'll naturally want to keep your knees locked and stiff. However, loose knees that can move easily are very important for figure skating, not just allowing you to move but also keeping your legs from getting sore.


Practice letting your muscles relax and shake your leg around. You can also get your knees loose by crouching just a very small amount.

, Now that you can stand on skates comfortably and safely, you can learn how to move forward on skates. With one leg pointed forward, push your other leg back and out to the side very gently, with your toes angled away from your body just a little bit. This back leg should push you along the ice. Bring the back leg back down and then make the same push but with the other leg.


Though the way you balance is different, you might want to learn this basic motion on street rollerblades before learning it on the ice. It is easier and can help keep you from hurting yourself.

, Of course, once you move forward, eventually you're going to want to stop. You can't just run into the wall forever! The most basic stop is done by bending your knees just a little and the leaning your body to the side, so that both of your blades are angled away from the direction you're moving in.


You can also do a T stop, which is done by turning one of your blades into a T shape with the other blade and angling it away from the direction you're moving in.

, With those basic motions under your belt, you'll want to learn how to do a basic forward stroke. Stroking is when you do the same motions for moving forward, but longer and more gracefully. Do a more dramatic push off with your leg and hold that leg out behind you for longer before switching to the other leg.


Practice this to get to a point where it looks graceful and natural. This will be the basic movement between all of the tricks and movements you will do when figure skating, so you want to do it well.

, The very first ""move"" you will learn as a figure skater will almost always be how to move backwards. This is a lead in to many figure skating tricks and is an important skill to learn and master. It takes coordination and practice but be patient: you'll get it.


For the basics on how to move backwards, imagine reversing the motions of moving forward. With your weight on one foot, make a motion with your other foot like you're drawing a lemon in the ice, pushing yourself backwards and you round the curve of the ""lemon"".

, Making sharp turns, or even just the gentle turn of the skating rink, is an important skill for a figure skater. Another early skill you will learn is how to do slightly more complex ways of making turns than the simple way you probably learned on your own.There are two common methods for doing turns that you will learn early on:


Forward crossovers are used for making large turns and building up momentum for jumps. Essentially, you will make the same motions that you do to move forward, but your legs will cross each other, slowly turning you. You can also do this same move backwards, although you should start with the forward movement.
The three turn is another method of turning, used for doing sharp turns and changes of direction. This is more complex but still very doable for a beginner.

, There are many different kinds of spins in figure skating and several of them are not as hard as they look. You'll probably be ready to do spins after about a year's worth of mastering the other moves.


A basic spin is done by spinning in a circle in one place.
A spiral is done by spinning with one leg and your upper body parallel to the ice.

, There are some series of movements or tricks that are standard in figure skating. This is called footwork and usually consists of a set of turns, spins, and jumps. Different sequences have different names and you'll want to learn some of the most basic sequences.


Examples include the mohawk and the waltz three turn.

, You'll want to work to be comfortable with all of the basic skating movements. Every time you learn a new motion, take a lot of time to do it before moving on to a new motion. This will let your muscles form ""memories"" about how to move that way, making it easier for you to make those motions without thinking about it. This is necessary for doing many complex tricks, since you can't always think about every little motion you make.

, You'll need to be strong and healthy if you want to be good and feel comfortable when you figure skate. Get lots of exercise, try not to sit around and watch television all day, and eat plenty of healthy food.


Your body will need lots of protein in order to work well while you skate. Try to eat protein that doesn't have a lot of fat, like turkey, fish, or nuts, so that your body doesn't feel weighed down.

, A coach or lessons might seem expensive, but it makes a huge difference in getting your skills built up. A coach will be able to see what you do wrong and help you fix your mistakes. They'll also be able to teach you new skills and tricks, helping you to become the best figure skater you can be.

, Practice. And then practice some more. Figure skating is a hard skill to learn. If it was easy, everyone would do it. That means that if you want to get good, or even just be okay, you'll need to figure skate a lot. It will take time to get to where you want to be and there are no tricks around it. You just have to work hard. You can do it!


With weekly practice lasting several hours, you can get good enough to do basic figure skating in about a year or two. Daily practice over many years is needed to reach a competition-level of skill.

, Put on a pair of skating tights and a pair of skating pants, a skating dress, a skirt and a tank top, or a pair of tight fitting pants. It is important to wear something that shows of your line, but is comfortable so you can move around in it. Grab a comfy, yet tight fitting jacket to put over your skating clothes. Make sure you wear tennis shoes you can warm up in, you wouldn't want to get an injury! Remember, people judge you on how you are dressed. If you come to the rink in a baggy sweatshirt and jeans, other skaters and coaches with think you are not serious about the sport., A ponytail or bun is acceptable. Don't have any hair in your face! You can also try braiding your hair in one or two braids. Add clips or ribbons to spice things up. Make sure the clips or ribbons match your clothes., Pack your ice skates with soakers and guards, a cloth (preferably cute with your name embroidered or a pair of ice skates with sequins), gloves, the music you are skating to, and a notepad and pen to copy down coaches notes. Pack some healthy snacks that won't make a big mess such as almonds or fruit if you're going to be at practice for a long time. Also make sure to bring a reusable water bottle with you since you'll be pretty tired from all that skating., Prepare an easy quick snack before you leave, don't eat a heavy meal you'll feel sick when you go to practice. Have a snack such as a smoothie, apple slices with peanut butter, carrots with hummus, a banana, a small salad, banana peanut bagel etc. Eating a healthy snack before practice will give your body the energy it needs to function properly., Once you're done getting ready, have a parent drive you or if the figure skating lesson are nearby, walk instead. Schedule enough time to arrive at the rink a half hour early to warm up or you could get an injury. Make sure to also stretch afterwards to loosen your muscles."

Imagine that you are trying to get on a bike. This is one method of getting comfortable with the feeling of a waltz jump).

, Keep in mind that you are not jumping yet, you are just getting the feel of the jump.


As you start the take-off, you should be leaving the ice on your left toe-pick so it is the last part of your boot that leaves the ice. Never rise off the ground on a flat blade. Never think of rotation; if you are in the right starting position you will automatically make the half rotation necessary.

, Don't get frustrated if it takes you some time, just keep practicing until you can go pretty high off the ground.

, You're going to jump off the ground, lifting up your right leg, followed closely with your left leg. When you land, be sure to keep your right foot straight. After landing, you should be skating on your right leg with your left leg extended behind you, gliding backwards.

, do three or four of these, and do a forward inside three turn as soon as you turn, jump with your right leg and land.

, The landing should start on your right toe-pick and should start rolling down to a flat blade on your right foot back outside edge. Never land on a flat blade as this will cause ankle, knee, and hip problems. You should be skating on your right leg with your left leg extended behind you, gliding backwards.

, It will be the first to land, and you obviously do not want to sprain it.


You may not feel comfortable doing the jump starting on your left foot and landing on your right. This turns you in an anti-clockwise direction. If you generally turn in a clockwise direction try reversing these instructions and starting on your right foot and then landing on your left. Which ever you choose stick with it and if you try spinning on the ice make sure you're turning in the same direction. It doesn't matter which way you turn but you need to jump and spin the in the same direction.

Land on the right foot, on a back outside edge.",How to Do a Toe Loop1," Clockwise jumpers should start on a left back outside edge, and should reverse or mirror the rest of these directions.


Note that many jumpers find it difficult to simply start the jump from this position --- see the tips below regarding ""Jump Preparation"".;
, The left arm should be straight in front of you; the right arm should be extended at the ""5 o'clock"" position. Both palms should face downward.

, Plant the toe pick firmly in the ice, preferably just to the right of the arc of travel of your other blade. Be sure to reach back; you don't want to trip yourself.

, The rotation will come naturally. Do imagine using your left leg like a pole vault.






As the launch happens, both your legs will end up with knees straight. Pull your hands together towards your chest, but leave the upper arms and elbows extended to the 12-o'clock and 5-o'clock positions. (Imagine your arms are two blades of a pocketknife, and you're closing it.)






Rotate a full 360-degree revolution in the air. This is not as difficult as it seems, once you've properly launched the jump!







, As you land, extend your arms fully to the sides in normal skating position. Your right knee should be bent and your left leg extended strongly. Arch your back, keep good skating posture, and try to remain on the back outside edge. Smile broadly -- it contributes to your confidence level!

Expose your child to figure skating.,
Encourage activities that help with agility and coordination.,
Skate together as a family.,
Start out by having your child walk on the ice.,
Practice basic skating moves.,
Avoid using chairs or similar devices.,
Enroll your child in other skill building classes.",How to Introduce Kids to Figure Skating1," If you want to motivate your child to learn how to skate, help get them excited about skating. Watch figure skating competitions on your television set. Have your child go to a local figure skating competition and watch other skaters. If you know another skater in your neighborhood, or a relative, have them talk to your child about figure skating.;
, Figure skating requires a lot of coordination and agility. To help your child prepare to learn how to skate, encourage them to play games that help with these skills. The following childhood games can help your child learn to figure skate:Hopscotch
Jumprope
Skip to my Lou
Twist and Shout
Tight rope

, Take advantage of local ice rinks and go skating as a family. Start when your child is young. Bring them out on the ice and help them develop basic skating skills.Make sure to use proper equipment for safety. Your child should wear a helmet as well as knee, ankle, and elbow pads. A child who is just learning the skate is likely to fall a lot at first.

, When your child first gets introduced to the ice, teach them to walk on it. This will help them gradually get used to the feel of ice and eventually build up to skating.Have them gently march on the ice, shifting their weight from one foot to another. At first, a child may only be able to march in place. Eventually, they should be able to move slightly across the ice.
Practice walking backwards and forwards and side stepping. Once your child gets used to the feel of ice, you can encourage them to skate.

, Once your child is comfortable walking, help them learn some basic skating moves. Have your child hold their hands in front as they push forward, moving them as if they're washing a table. This will help them maintain balance. Teach them to start slowly gliding on the ice. Have your child hold one blade sideways and push forward across the ice., Many parents encourage their child to lean on chairs and slide them across the ice when they first begin skating. However, this encourages children to lean forward when they skate. In the long run, this can lead to bad habits that can make figure skating difficult. Avoid using chairs for support when introducing your child to basic skating moves., In addition to taking figure skating, look for other classes that build skills basic to skating. Gymnastics, roller blading, tumbling, and dance classes can all help your child get into figure skating.


Make sure not to overwhelm your child with too many extracurricular activities. Let your child choose which activities interest them and do not force them to take a course they dislike.

Find classes in your area.,
Get the right gear.,
Help your child with falls.,
Practice with your child.",How to Introduce Kids to Figure Skating2," Figure skating requires specific skill sets and patient teaching. It's best to find a professional to teach your child figure skating. Look for ads in the local paper or search online. You can also keep your eye out at community centers or local schools.If you know parents whose children figure skate, ask them to direct you to local teachers.

, Before your child starts lessons, make sure you get the right supplies. You will have to spend a little money to get your child started on figure skating, but remember this can be a lifelong hobby that can encourage physical activity and raise your child's self esteem.Get a helmet. This is vital for your child's safety on the ice.
Get a solid pair of skates. Go to a skate shop and have your child fitted by a professional. The right skates can help your child figure skate successfully.
Make sure your child has things like a jacket and hat to keep warm. It can get cold out on the ice, especially if your child is skating at an outdoor arena.

, Your child will fall on the ice. It's important you teach your child how to fall to minimize injury. Let your child know to bend their knees to one side when they feel they're falling. This will help them fall gently. To get back up, instruct your child to kneel on both knees. Then, have them move one leg upward until their blade is flat on the ice and then push themselves up., Regular practice is important. If your child is slowly improving, they will enjoy figure skating more. Practicing with your child will help them feel enthusiastic about skating and they'll find themselves improving.


Remember, your child should not use a chair for support. To help with falls, skate near your child instead of using a chair. Hold the child gently under your arms to help support them as they learn to skate."
"
Be willing to splurge a little.,
Explain that winning is not everything.,
Handle setbacks with grace.,
Do not compare your child to others.",How to Introduce Kids to Figure Skating3," If you want your child to be invested in a hobby, keep in mind it's a financial investment as well. You do not need to overspend on top notch equipment, especially if you can find solid skates secondhand. However, budget each month for things like lessons, new skates, and other expenses., Make sure your child is invested in figure skating for the right reasons. While participating in competitions can be fun, a child may stop enjoying the sport if there's an overemphasis on winning. Talk to your child about how they should figure skate for their own enjoyment.Tell your child winning does not make them successful. Say something like, ""Have fun in the competition, but remember your goal is to improve yourself personally. I'll be proud of you even if you don't win.""

, Figure skating comes with a lot of tests and competitions. Your child will sometimes not perform as well as they want. Encourage them to see setbacks as an opportunity to learn and grow.For example, say your child does not pass a figure skating test. Say something like, ""This is a good thing. You know where you need to improve and you can do great next time.""
Remind your child it's okay that they're not perfect. Say something like, ""Even the best skaters have their bad days.""

, Figure skating can get competitive. Never compare your child to another skater. If your child compares themselves to a peer, say something like, ""Everyone goes at their own pace. There's nothing wrong with that."""

If you are doing any right leg spiral you will need to stretch out your left leg. Vice-versa for a left spiral
A good start is placing the leg that will be up against a wall and keep inching closer to the wall forcing your leg higher.
You can also hold onto the wall and lift your leg up. Practice your spiral position.

, Work out your core and lower back for both flexibility and strength.

,,

If you rock suddenly forward it is okay to put your leg down and try again.

Prepare to step into the crossover circle by gliding on right backward inside edge with right arm in front of the body and left behind.

,Step into the circle with a left forward outside edge slightly changing the arms so that the left shoulder is checked in front and the right is between the back and side, this edge should create the shape of half a heart or a candy cane that tightens creating the turn that begins the spin

,
Once it gets tight enough, you will hit the area of your blade just before the toepick (the sweet spot) and you will complete the three-turn that will create your rotation.,
To begin to spin faster, slowly bend your elbows and bring your hands into your chest.,
Once your hands are nearing your chest and your right foot is nearing your knee, you can either clasp your hands and move them above your head, down toward your stomach or tighter into your chest


At the same time as you complete your arm movement, slide your right foot down across your left foot

Finally, stretch your hands into their tightest possible position by extending them completely upward or downward or squeeze them in as close as possible


At the same time lock your leg down as tight as possible to the other leg.",How to Do a Scratch Spin,", This is important as it helps to balance when centering your spin.

,,,, Your arms should be out to your sides at an angle slightly lower than your shoulders and your right foot should up held up at an approx. 45 degree angle to the ice and slightly to your side. This is when you center and balance your spin on the ice to prepare for increasing your rotational velocity.

, This should feel as if you are squeezing a stuffed animal into your chest, your hands will feel centrifugal forces resisting your hands. By resisting this force and pulling your hands in, you will gain speed.


At the same time, bring your right leg toward your left knee into the approximate shape of a ""4""

Lean slightly forward and press in with your heels by bending your knees.",How to Stop when Skiing2,", For instance, if you want to lean left, then your left foot will put weight on the outside edge of your foot and your right foot will put weight on the inside edge of your foot. If you fall down, it'll be okay, since you were trying to stop anyway!

, You might feel your legs press against the front of your boots. You can also kick out your heels to accelerate your transition. This should help turn your skis both parallel to the slope while keeping your motion in same direction you were headed. The edge of your skis and angle of the ski to the slope becomes crucial as it skids across the snow.

Now that you got the moves sorted, you can move on to working on the expressions.",How to Choreograph Skating Programs for Recreational and Exhibition Uses," Unlike dancing in a club, spontaneity is not a good idea, unless if you only want to work on your turns and do no spins and jumps. Even when you are skating recreationally and the DJ plays the songs, it is better to have a few of your favourite songs and songs you know well already in your memory and talk to the DJ and request them, or have your own mix tape ready.;
, Just like singing, where there are songs you simply can't sing to, don't try to force to plan an overly ambitious program if you can't perform a triple Axel or land a jump combo, or skate to a song that simply doesn't suit you.

, For example, if you are a jump expert, fit a couple of jumps here and there, but if you are better at step sequences, change the speed of skating.

,, Remember: Figure skating is as much about artistry and expressive interpretation as well as technical prowess. Your face is also a part of interpreting your music as well as the costume you've chosen and body movements on the ice.

Determine the type of skiing.,
Compare the skis to your height.,
Evaluate your skiing ability.,
Add length for above average weight.,
Consider terrain and skiing style.,
Check waist width.,
Examine tip and tail widths.,
Find the ski's turn radius.,
Examine camber and rocker designs.,
Try men's and women's skis.",How to Size Skis," Cross-country, downhill, and trick skiing all use different ski designs. Using the wrong style of skis can be very dangerous.


Cross-country skis are long, thin, and flat, with a pointed toe.
Downhill skis are shorter and fatter, with a round, flared toe.;
, Stand the skis vertically next to you. As a starting point, look at skis that stand between your chin and the crown of your head.There are more factors to consider, but browse this general range for initial options.


If you prefer to stick to numbers, measure your height in centimeters and look for skis no more than 15 cm shorter than yourself.
Young children should use skis at chin height or a little shorter. Don't be tempted to pick a size that they'll ""grow into,"" as this will be more difficult and dangerous., Shorter skis are more nimble, but less stable at high speeds. Longer skis are more stable at high speeds, but have a longer turning radius and tend to be sluggish at slow speeds.Use this guide to narrow your options:Beginner skiers should look for skis around chin or mustache height. These are great skis for practicing smooth turns and control.
Intermediate skiers should look for skis around nose height. Most amateur skiers fall in this category.
Advanced skiers can look for skis near eyebrow height.
Expert skiers may try any skis from the eyebrow up, sometimes even a little beyond the head.

, Heavyset skiers may wish to use skis that are a bit longer than the recommendations above. These longer skis can help in weight distribution, which is essential for maintaining safety while skiing.


At higher weight, two models with the same size can feel quite different. Ask ski store employees or online ski forums for advice on specific brands that suit your weight and experience level.Reduce ski length if you are significantly below average weight for your height.

, The type of skiing you do affects your ideal ski size. Skip this step if you ski on a variety of terrain, or if you're not sure what you'll be doing. For more specialized skiers, or skiers shopping for multiple pairs of skis, here's a quick guide:Choose shorter skis if you enjoy quick, short turns at slow or moderate speeds.
Choose longer skis if you do most of your skiing off-piste, or if you have a fast, aggressive skiing style.
When skiing through crud (chopped-up powder) at speed, it's best to use long skis, at least as tall as you are.

, Ski width measurements are usually given as a series of three numbers in millimeters, such as ""130/100/125."" The second number is the most important: the waist or ""underfoot"" width, directly under your feet. (If your ski has four or more measurements, the smallest one is the waist width.) Personal preference is a major factor, but here's a rough guide:60–70mm: minimum waist width, used only on ice and groomed hard-pack
70–95mm: ""carvers"" or ""all-mountain"" skis, easy to turn and versatile
95–110mm: ""big mountain"" and ""powder"" skis, more stable on soft snow; a good option for any off-piste skier
110mm+: used only on powder; the wider the waist, the more you'll float and the worse your edge hold.

, These are less important than the waist width. Use them as a final tiebreaker when choosing sizes. Here's how the measurements work:The first measurement listed is the tip or ""shovel"" width. A tip about 120mm wide and up works best on soft snow. More narrow tips are best for hard snow and sharper turns, but are falling out of favor among amateur skiers.The last measurement is the tail width. Most beginner and intermediate skiers don't need to worry about this one. During fast, tight turns, a wider tail will reduce skidding and speed loss.

, Each pair of skis should specify a turn radius in meters, describing the natural arc the ski comfortably turns along. Generally, skis with a turning radius in the low to mid teens will be easier to control on tight turns. A turning radius in the high teens or low twenties adds stability during fast descents, but you'll sacrifice some agility while turning.This is also called the ""sidecut radius."" The sidecut is the inward arc along the side of your ski, The sidecut radius is the radius of the circle that would be formed by continuing this curve., Lay the ski flat on the ground, unweighted. If the center is raised off the floor in a dome shape, the ski has a ""camber"" profile. If the center is flat, with the ends curving upward, the ski is a ""rocker"" or ""reverse camber"" design. Here are the most common variations on this basic idea:Full camber: the contact points with the ground are as close to the tip and tail as possible, and the center is raised. These models are more difficult to turn, so beginners should try something else. However, the springy effect from pushing the center down to the snow gives excellent speed for racing and park skiing, and the even pressure along the ski provides great edge hold.

Full rocker: an upward curve with the center flat on the floor, as though the ski were already weighted. This design helps lift you on top of soft snow, makes turning easier, and keeps wider ski designs more stable. Because you'll have a smaller effective edge, consider increasing the length by 5–15cm to make up the difference, especially if you ski at high speeds.Rocker/camber/rocker: the central camber with raised tip and tail. This is a versatile, forgiving option. Consider it if you'll only have one pair of skis.

Rocker/camber: a cambered ski with a raised tip, but a contact point near the tail. Mostly used on big mountain skis, these give you power without sinking in deep snow. The asymmetric design makes ski switching difficult.

, Most women's models have an ""L"" after the name, making them easy to find. However, these are not necessarily the best option for all women. Some models may adapt for women's different balance of weight and lower center of gravity. Other manufacturers follow outdated ideas of what women's skis are, simply making them shorter and lighter weight for less intense skiing. Women may want to try quality women's skis, but don't rule out unisex or ""men's"" skis.On any skis, women should consider moving the bindings forward compared to men's skis, to compensate for the different distribution of weight.

A green circle indicates an easy, or beginner, trail. These trails are not too fast, will contain few obstacles and aren't too long. These trails also don't have a very steep grade.
A blue square indicates an intermediate trail. It may contain some obstacles or steeper grade and you shouldn't go on these until you've mastered the easier trails.
A black diamond indicates a difficult trail. It may contain obstacles, moguls (small hills of snow), and a steep grade with a narrow way down. Don't attempt a trail like this if you are inexperienced. Although you might think you are ready, you probably aren't. Many people have been injured by attempting too difficult a run too early.
A double black diamond, or a black diamond with an exclamation mark in it, indicates a run that should only be attempted by very good skiers. Don't go down a run like this unless you are completely comfortable with all other kinds of runs. It's also a good idea to go with a partner. Once you are ready for a double black, be sure it does not have ""EX"" in the middle. This indicates an 'Expert Only"" trail, the only thing harder than is heli-skiing. (Where they drop you off in helicopters. These slopes are very avalanche prone.);
, Therefore, a run marked with a blue square at one resort may be more challenging than a run marked with a black diamond at another resort. For this reason, when skiing at a new resort, you should always begin with a green run and work your way up, even if you are an accomplished skier.
, People ahead of you (meaning down the slope from you) have the right of way. It is your responsibility to avoid them, even if they fall right in front of you. Because of this, it is best to keep a fair amount of distance between you and the skier or snowboarder in front of you.







, It is your responsibility to know what speed and slope difficulty you can handle. Do not go on a black diamond simply because you think you are a natural-born skier but have never actually skied before. You run the risk of seriously injuring (or even killing) someone else, or yourself, if you crash.








, While it is common to stop and catch your breath on the slope, it's very dangerous to stop if you obstruct the trail or cannot be seen by someone coming down the trail. People coming down the slope could crash into you.








If you do feel the need to stop, try to stop at the top of the next section of the slope that's visible from above, like the crest of a hill, or pull over to the side of the run.

, If you are renting your boots, ask an attendant to help you figure out which boot is best for you. You'll need to find the right size and adjust the tightness. At rest, your foot should be be essentially immobile but not compressed. Your toes should not press against the front of the boot when you bend your knees to point your shins slightly forward at the angle of the boot. The top of the boot should be snug around your ankle.It's easiest to walk in ski boots by taking long steps, smoothly rolling the stiff boot bottom forward heel-to-toe with your lower leg straight as your body passes over.
Once you have your boots on, carry your skis and poles out to the snow. The skis have edges with sharp angles that might have rough or sharp spots, so carry them with gloves.

, Your skis might be locked together, bottom-to-bottom, by the clip-like ""snow brakes"" extending from the bindings past the flat sides. Their purpose is to keep the skis from sliding away when they pop off your boots during a fall, which protects your knees from excessive twisting. They also make a pair of skis easier to carry. Find a flat area in the snow. Set the pair of skis upright on their back end, hold down the one with its brake ""inside"", and gently shake and wiggle off the one with its brake ""outside"".








, Set the skis pointing in the same direction about a foot apart. Many skis will work on either foot, but check to see if your skis have any ""L"" or ""R"" markings on them and, if so, put them on the correct side. Stick your poles in the snow on each side of the skis, a few inches to the side and next to the front edge of the binding. Hold onto the poles and, one foot at a time, tuck the flange at the boot's toe into the front binding and then push the flange at the boot's heel into the rear binding, which should close with a click. Slide each foot back and forth a little to check that the ski has attached. If it hasn't, try again.







, To take off a ski, or to reset its latch to retry a failed mounting (or if it fails to reset itself after detaching from your boot during a fall), push down the lever behind the boot so that it is parallel to the ski. This is most easily pushed with a pole by putting the spike into the indentation.









If you fall and have trouble righting yourself, take off the ski on your ""ground side"" (the side that is flat on the ground), right yourself with the other ski and poles, and then remount the removed ski.

, Although this may not be a first option for everyone, since they can be expensive and sometimes aren't fun, it is arguably the fastest way to get the basics down. Look for beginners' classes that are offered at skiing resorts and on the mountain.

It is best to enroll in a class weeks before you will go up to the mountains, as they generally fill up quickly. Enroll in a class that fits your age group (or else you may accidentally end up in a childrens’ ski class.)
Many resorts offer inexpensive and plentiful lift-ticket, rental and beginner group class packages. You can generally show up and sign right up. Some have inexpensive novice and intermediate level group short classes running on a schedule throughout the day as well. These are great for working out initial kinks, as a refresher, or to build confidence for bigger hills.

, One of the first things you should learn is how to move around in skis. You will end up walking in skis when you are getting to a lift, or if you fall and have to get to a wayward ski, among other instances. One of the most common ways to move yourself over flat or uphill terrain is to keep the skis parallel and push yourself forward with the poles. With both arms simultaneously, stab the poles, angled gently rearward, into the snow beside you, rotate your entire arms smoothly backward, and repeat. The angle lets you use your stronger shoulder muscles rather than your weaker forearm muscles to pull back. Pull one side more than the other to turn. Do not ""saw"" the skis back and forth as with a skiing exerciser or move arms alternately: cross-country skiinguses special hinged bindings to enable sweeping ski motion and wax to help pressure on part of the ski during part of the sawing motion move you forward. This method is good for starting onto a downhill stretch because the skis are positioned parallel, ready to go.









""Herringbone"" (a technique named after the fish-bone patterns the skis leave in the snow). Point your ski tips away from each other, so they make a ""V"" shape, and take small steps forward. Tilt the leading edge into the snow and push forward to prevent slipping back. Bend your knees and lean forward a little so you can use the stronger leg-extension muscles to push yourself forward rather than the weaker leg-rotation muscles to pass one ski after another under you. You can climb hills this way. Spread the skis more the steeper the hill, and if you begin to slide backwards. Use the poles to avoid falling over, and keep them outside of the skis' area so you don't trip on them.
You can also ""side-step"" up an incline. Stand perpendicular (sideways) to the slope of the hill, dig the uphill edges of your skis into the snow (as with the herringbone) and take small steps sideways. Keep the skis perpendicular to the slope at your point, and use the poles to reduce unwanted forward or backward slipping as you work your way sideways up the hill.
Skate-skiing is fastest.. Angle the skis as if to ""herringbone"", but allow yourself to slide forward smoothly on one close to directly under you and transition to gently digging it in sideways and kicking it outward as you place the other ski under you on the other side, maintaining forward momentum, much as with ice skating.. You'll smoothly transition to herringbone movement on steep surfaces.

, The leg muscles are stronger than the arm muscles, especially in women and untrained men, so as a beginner try to use the herringbone and skate-skiing techniques as much as possible to avoid prematurely tiring your upper body.









Do not go up any hills until you are confident in basic movements with your skis.

, Bend your knees so your shins rest on the front of the boots and lean forward slightly. The length of the skis will make falling forward unlikely. Leaning back, though tempting when you're feeling out of control, will not normally stop you and will actually make the skis even harder to control. Put your hands through the straps on the ski poles and hold the poles by your sides. During most actual skiing, you'll want them ready to be used, but won't actually use them.








Do not bend sharply forward. Ski racers often use the ""French egg position"" of hunching forward onto their thighs to minimize air resistance in straights, but it keeps the hips from swiveling and the arms from swinging freely for balance or leveraging poles for turns.

, Spread the tips apart (herringbone) to stop sliding backwards, and the backs apart (wedge) to stop sliding forwards. The muscles for pushing the legs outward are much stronger than the ones for pushing them inwards, so forcing the skis apart against gravity's force works while forcing them together just leads to uncomfortable ""splits"".








, Point your skis together, then push your heels out to form a wedge with an open point and the leading sides tilted slightly up into the oncoming snow. This is known as the ""pizza"", ""wedge"", or ""snowplow"" after an old-fashioned wedge-shaped plow. The wider you spread it, the slower you go. Do not overlap the tips of your skis--that tends to lead to a loss of control.








, Once you have mastered the “pizza” you can move on to a more advanced way of stopping. This involves turning so that your skis are perpendicular to the downward slope of the hill. Turning is also an important part of skiing (as well as stopping). To turn, all you have to do is point your feet (and your skis) in the direction you want to travel. For a strong ""parallel turn"", push the ""outside"" ski away from the body keeping it parallel to the direction of travel. You and your skis will turn. For an extra smooth ""carved"" turn, tilt the outside ski's ankle to bite its ski's inside edge into the snow and ride on a banked turn. You should feel the ski cutting into the snow to generate the turning force, rather than sliding sideways over the snow. If you want to stop while turning, keep your feet in the plow position and turn across and slightly up the hill. You will come to a slow stop.








Eventually, you will be able to stop simply by turning and placing enough force against the snow that you come to a halt with your skis still in a parallel position.

A very quick parallel turn of the skis before the body's motion has a chance to catch up to their new orientation, followed by pressure on the uphill ski to dig them into the snow, results in a ""hockey stop"". This takes practice!



, If you are about to crash into a tree or another person, and are a beginner, don't try to swerve, as you will probably hit something else. Instead, just fall to your side. When possible, fall uphill as you are much less likely to get injured when you fall uphill (your distance to fall is smaller and your skis stay downhill from your body). Try to absorb a fall with your hip and shoulder. Do not try to catch yourself with your arms, as you are much more likely to injure your arm that you are to injure your hip or shoulder.









Try to stay as relaxed as possible when you fall. If you feel yourself falling, try not to tense up or you will probably do more damage to yourself. When you tense up, your muscles become tight and you are much more likely to pull something.

,

Ski-walk up to the chairlift. If you have poles, be sure to take the straps off your wrist and safely hold both poles in one hand or under one arm. Keeping your poles on your wrists could be dangerous and will make it much more challenging to get on the lift.
Wait until the operator says it's your turn, and then quickly move into the loading area. Once there, look over your shoulder to watch the chair coming around.
As it approaches, you can optionally grab the side pole or back of the chair to steady yourself. Then simply sit down and allow it to pick you up.
Lifts usually have room for two, four or even six people per chair, so make sure you and your friend are side by side when the chair approaches.
Enjoy the view, but do not ever lean over the edge of the chair while you are in the air, even if your ski or a mitten falls off. You will be able to get it later. Leaning too far out of the lift could cause you to fall which almost always results in serious injury and can occasionally lead to death.
When your chair reaches the top, point your skis forward and push away from the chair as it goes around. Use the movement of the chair to propel you up and away from the lift.If you fail to get off the chairlift at the supposed point, do not panic, and do not try to jump down. You will trip a switch which will stop the lift, and somebody will help you down.

, A bunny hill is defined as a small slope, preferably with a rope tow. Go up the carpet lift, rope tow or chairlift to the top of the bunny hill.

A carpet lift is a big conveyor belt. In one arrangement, you push yourself forward onto the leading edge, ride it most of the way with your poles on the belt, ready to brace yourself on them against a sudden stop usually caused by a child's or beginner's error. Several feet from the end, lift your poles to avoid jamming the end mechanism and lean gently forward to smoothly ski to a halt off the end of it.
If it is a rope tow, wait until a handle comes around, grab it, and allow the rope to pull you up. Do not drag yourself or sit on the rope tow. When the rope pulls you to the top, let go and use the herring board to get away from the lift.

, Watch out for others, especially if the bunny slope is at the foot of another slope from which other skiers may come in fast. Allow yourself to begin sliding down the slope, but go slowly. Keep your skis pointed together. Once you reach the bottom, point the skis toward each other and make a wide angle. This will stop you fairly quickly. If you fall, point the skis so they point across the slope, not down it. Push yourself up, orient yourself, and continue down the slope.
, For your first few times going down the hill, you may want to stay in the “pizza” position (which gives you the most control.) After you have done the bunny hill a few times, you will likely begin to want to turn. To do this, shift your weight onto the ski that is not in the direction you want to turn. Pushing against it tends to swing your body sideways behind it so that it continues, now at an angle cutting against the snow, in front of you. Lean into and dig the ski edges into a turn a little to make it sharper. Plan ahead: curves will be wide at first. Give obstacles plenty of space! Once you know how to do this, you can go down the hill in a curved kind of zigzag.









Look ahead. If you're looking directly down at your skis while going down a run, you could hit a tree, another person, or anything else that might block your path.

, If you lean too far back, you will have a very hard time turning, which may cause you to lose control and crash. If you lean too far forward, your skis will get squirrelly, and you may wipe out. A good technique is to keep your knees slightly bent, and keep your hands in front of you, like you're holding a lunch tray.








, Once you have mastered the bunny hill -- that is, you can ride the lift, walk on the flat part, ski down, turn both ways and stop with ease -- you should be ready to try a beginner hill. Consult with your instructor. See if he or she thinks you are ready, and then get ready for the rest of the mountain!
, Consult the ski map to find a suitable trail. It should be close to the base area. Try to find a green run that starts at the top of a lift and ends at the base area, or a series of trails that are all green. Ride up the lift, and start on the trail.
, As you go down more runs, you should learn to ski without using the technique that keeps you moving slowly. Once you become accustomed to skiing the green trails, try putting your skis parallel to each other for parts of the slope. Parallel skiing will cause you to go faster. Instead of going back into pizza turn across the mountain to control your speed. Instead of using the pizza technique, try using the parallel stopping technique. Stopping parallel will make you stop faster and have more control.
, Before selecting a trail, make sure you know how to turn and stop. These skills will be very important. Select a trail that starts at the top of a lift and ends at the base area, or select a path made up of blue and green trails. While going down the intermediate trail, you may notice it is steeper and you will probably wipe out a little more. Don't worry about this. With practice, these trails will become easier.
, There are generally more intermediate trails than any other kind of trail. This is your chance to really get comfortable on your skis. Practice all of the techniques listed above. Enjoy yourself! Explore all of the intermediate trails and find the one you like best--then go down it multiple times!
, Skiing on these trails is when this activity can become dangerous. Always ski with caution. By now, you have probably left the pizza far behind and are now using parallel skiing and, hopefully, turning to make your way down the mountain. If you are not yet at this stage, please stick to the intermediate trails, because you can get hurt and disturb other experienced skiers if you try to start hard trails too soon. You should also learn to turn with the edges of your skis as you advance.

If you do find yourself on a trail that you think you can't handle, then by all means, ask somebody to get the ski patrol. They will most likely give you a ""courtesy"" ride down in a toboggan. Also, don't be afraid to ask any of the ski patrol or other mountain staff if you have any questions about any particular trail or the mountain as a whole.

, Moguls are large mounds of snow that are created on certain runs. Only more advanced skiers should try a mogul run out, as they can be very challenging to get through without falling many times. When going down a mogul run, you want to curve up and around the mounds. To control yourself, try to turn up the mountain every time you round a mogul.As you get more comfortable with the moguls, you can begin to point your skis down the slope, which will cause you to travel more quickly down and around the moguls.

Decide what type of cross country skiing you'd like to do, as they are all sized differently.,
Check the weight specifications of any set of skis before purchasing.,
Multiply your height in inches by 2.7, then add 15"" to get a good approximation of Classic Touring skis.,
Know that Compact Skis usually come in several pre-made sizes based on weight.,
Determine your skating ski size by experience level.,
Aim for back-country skis to be roughly 10cm taller than you when stood up end to end.",How to Size Cross Country Skis1," The type of skiing you plan to do will determine how you need to size yourself, as each has slightly different uses and designs.


Traditional or Classic skis are for groomed trails and all skill levels. They come in either normal or compact.


Skate Skis are used for racing/speed skiing, and are usually preferred by intermediate or advanced skiers. They are shorter and thinner than traditional skis.


Off-Track Skis are a hybrid between traditional and skate. They are wider than traditional skis and are used for open, ungroomed territory.


Backcountry skis are shorter and used for longer off-trail explorations. They can be used in many terrains, and are light-weight as possible.
;
, Before you get to size and length, make sure you're in the weight range for each set of skis before buying them. In many ways, weight is more important than height for determining the right size skis, as bigger skis distribute more weight than smaller ones.Some ski companies have even stopped using height to determine ski size, instead using unique weight ranges for each set of skis they produce.Most skis will have a ""recommended weight range"" in their specification section.


, Note, however that this because most skis are sold in centimeters, not inches. If you're 6"", you are 72 inches tall, meaning you'd aim for a 210cm set of skis.

Note that this is an approximation -- you should try out a few pairs to see what you prefer whenever possible.

The skis should always be 10-15 cm taller than you, never shorter., Compact skis are less varied, and usually come in four sizes, small through extra-large. These sizes change based on the company making them but are usually recommended based on weight ranges. Note, however, that there is some overlap. If you have shorter legs and fall between two ranges, take the smaller skis. If you have long legs, grab the bigger size, but know that this is mostly up to preference:


Under 140 lbs --  Small


135-190lbs --  Medium


175-210lbs --  Large


Over 210 lbs --  Extra Large, For racing skis in particular, the longer skis are essential to build up speed. But more important than length alone is ""camber,"" or the curve of the ski. The right camber can be found using a percentage of your body weight. To take percentage of you body weight, simply multiply your weight in kilograms by the percentage. So, if you're and intermediate and weigh 100kg, you would aim for a camber around 125 (100kg∗1.25=125{\displaystyle 100kg*1.25=125}).


Beginners: Aim for a camber around 100-115% body weight in kg


Intermediate: 110-125% body weight in kg


Advanced: 120-130% body weight in kg., Again, the exact size is up to comfort level, but you do want to make sure the skis are taller than you are by a few centimeters. Backcountry skiing is often for more experienced skiers with established preferences and comfort, and you should test out skis before buying. When in the backcountry, you'll be on those skis for hours at a time. Make sure they are the right size for you and your ski style before spending a ton of money.

Backcountry skies should be wide, and may be a bit shorter than other types of skis.

Try out the ""paper test"" to see if the skis suit your weight well.,
Rent out a 1-2 sizes for a day to see what you are more comfortable on.,
If stuck between two sizes of skis, consider your leg length, not your total height.,
If you're stuck between two weight levels, consider you experience level.,
Choose the right pole size for your type of skiing.",How to Size Cross Country Skis2," On a hard floor, place a piece of normal paper underneath the skis. Step into them like normal, and slide back and forth. When you have weight evenly on both skis, the paper should slide around easily. When you have weight on just one ski, the paper shouldn't slide at all.
, If you're between the ranges of two sizes, or just feel unsure about them, then take them for a test. Many ski shops will let you test out the skis out back as well, and there is no excuse not to try on the skis before buying. Just like shoes or clothes, you should try something you're going to be using often to make sure it fits.

Which ones move the smoothest under your feet? 

Where do you feel better balanced?


, The length of your legs is more important to consider than your total height, and this is often the ""tie-breaker"" if you're in between sizes. That said, the best thing to do is try both pairs on and see which fits your body best., The better a skier you are, the better prepared you are for longer skis. If you're in between the two weight classes, ask yourself honestly about your skill level and commitment to the sport. Better skiers should grab longer skis, and newbies should aim for something shorter.

If you plan on skiing a lot, you might still aim for the bigger skis, even if you're not experienced. As you get better, you'll ""grow"" into the big skis, so you won't have to buy a new set of skis once you're a pro.


, In general, skate skiing requires longer poles, as you extend further out to the sides. Traditional skier usually like shorter poles, though not by much. In both cases, they should come up roughly to your armpits when standing straight up.


Skate: Should be roughly 90% of your height.


Traditional: Should be roughly 85% of your height."

Fuel up.,
Plan your day.,
Dress for success!,
Accessories.",How to Stay Warm While Skiing1," It is very important to make sure you have enough food and calories in your body before you go outside for a day of physical activity in the snow. It is especially important for skiing because you need fuel in order to stay warm.


Eat a complete breakfast. Make sure you intake enough carbohydrates to give you energy and fuel for physical activity during the day as well as proteins that help you satisfy your appetite and help build and repair your muscles.






Hydrate. It is very important before spending a day doing physical activity to drink lots of water. This is to prevent your body from being dehydrated out on the slopes.





;
, Make sure you are prepared for the day of skiing ahead of you to ensure that you stay warm during the day. There are many important factors to consider before going out skiing and the following that you should consider:


Know your body. Are you a typically hot-blooded person? Or do you get cold very easily? By knowing your body’s natural reactions, it can be helpful when deciding how to prepare yourself for a day outside in the cold snow. It can also help you determine if you need to wear that extra layer of clothing or not.






Know the climate. Are you going to be skiing in Colorado where it rarely rains? Is it going to be a sunny day where you may need to bring sunscreen? Are you going to be skiing in chilly cold weather conditions where you need a heavy-duty ski jacket? These are important questions to ask yourself before you go skiing, because different locations have different climates, which can influence your choice on what to wear when skiing to stay warm.






How long will you be skiing for? It is also important to plan on how long you will be out on the slopes skiing. Depending on the change in weather conditions, or if it’s expected to rain or snow later in the day, it would be a good idea to prepare and decide whether or not you should bring an extra layer of clothing with you.







, Make sure you dress appropriately before you go outside skiing. This is a crucial step and you do not want to end up being wet and cold at the end of your day. Here are the following critical items that you may need before going out skiing.


Wear base-layers. Whenever you are skiing, it is imperative that you wear base-layers. If you are skiing, you'll want layers. If you wipe-out or fall onto the snow, your ""shell"", or your exterior layer (heavy coat), will get wet quickly, and you'll want to stay as dry as possible. From long underwear to long sleeve tees, base-layers should be comfortable, light, and breathable clothes. You need the base-layers to be comfortable and be form-fitting to your body so they fit nicely under your ski jacket and you can move freely. These layers also need to be breathable so if they get wet from the snow or from sweating, they can dry quickly and not cause a problem. Also depending on the weather or if you tend to get cold, you can wear multiple base layers on top of each other. Recommended base-layer clothing are made of Merino wool and polyester because they are optimal materials for keeping moisture away from your skin.







Ski jacket. As mentioned above, when you go skiing, you need to wear a “shell” or ski jacket over your base-layers. A ski jacket is used to protect your upper body. You should try to find a jacket that is waterproof to protect you from being wet, insulating to keep you warm, and form fitting to allow you to move freely while you ski.







Ski pants. Also referred to as snow pants, ski pants are also important when it comes to dressing appropriately before you go skiing. It’s recommended that the ski pants are long enough to cover your snow boots in order to insulate your legs and prevent moisture from snow entering under your ski pants. Ski pants also block wind and icy chills from entering your legs and feet, helping you stay warm while you ski.







Ski gloves. Ski gloves are specifically designed for skiing because they are waterproof, insulating, and protective from windy and chilly weather conditions. It’s important to find a pair of gloves that are also comfortable and form fitting for your hands. A good pair of gloves will allow you to move your hands pretty freely without the gloves being very loose, and falling off.







Ski socks. Ski socks, like base–layers need to be comfortable, light, and breathable socks. Wearing only one pair of quality ski socks will go a long way. Socks often get wet when skiing, so it’s important to find socks that can dry very quickly.







Ski helmet. A ski helmet is extremely important for protecting your head in case of an accident or a wipe-out. Ski helmets also warm your head as well. They insulate your head and protect your head from the wind chill and snow.







, Often times, people like to get extra ski accessories to stay warm when they go out skiing. The following are popular ski accessories that you may want to think about getting before going out to ski:



Hand and feet warmers. These are very popular and are inexpensive accessory for people when they go outside in cold winter weather conditions. Hand and feet warmers are little packets that can be easily inserted into your ski gloves and ski boots.







Glove and boot liners. If you don’t like hand and feet warmers, another alternative to keep your fingers and toes extra warm is to purchase glove and boot liners. They are thin fleece material liners that you can wear under your ski gloves and inside your ski boots. They provide insulation to your hands and feet, helping you stay warm while skiing.







Neck gaiters. This is a tube-like accessory made of insulating material that protects your neck and face from windy and chilly weather conditions while skiing. They provide extra warmth and a good neck gaiter is breathable and moisture resistant so there is ventilation and mobility while you ski.

Take breaks.,
Do not clench your toes when cold.,
Pack extra hand and feet warmers or dry glove liners and socks.",How to Stay Warm While Skiing2," It’s important to take breaks, especially if you plan on skiing for an extended period of time. Every hour or two, it may be a good idea to reenergize and warm up.


Find a place that is warm (preferably indoors). Going indoors periodically can help your body warm up. You can take off your ski boots and gloves and warm up your fingers and toes by placing them near a heat source or simply rubbing them. This helps recirculate the blood flow in your frigid fingers and toes and can help you feel more comfortable when you go back outside to ski.






Refuel. Skiing takes a lot out of you. Your body may be tired and needs a snack or lunch to reenergize before going back to the slopes again. Also often times when you are hungry, your body tends to feel colder than when your hunger is satisfied. A good idea could be to drink hot soup or hot chocolate to satiate your hunger as well as warming up your insides!






Dry your wet ski clothes and boots. Invest in a boot dryer or find a heat source to warm up and dry your wet boots, socks, and gloves. Skiing in wet gear is not fun or comfortable, so it may be a good idea to take a break and draw out the moisture from your clothes.







, Often times when skiers are cold, they clench their toes when they are cold. This actually doesn’t work because it restricts blood flow in your feet and cause your toes to become even colder. A good way to warm yourself up while you’re on the slopes is to swing your feet back and forth on the lift to warm up your lower body and circulate blood back to your feet.

, When you are feeling extremely uncomfortable because you’re very wet or cold and it’s difficult to find a warm indoors area to rest and warm up, having extra supplies in your ski jacket to warm your body up would be helpful. Be careful not to pack too many supplies in your ski jacket that would prevent mobility and comfort while skiing.

Finish with a quick wipe down with a rag.

",How to Repair Gouges in a Ski's Base," If you have access to a vice, secure skis in it with a rag between the vice and ski. It is important to make sure there are as few flammable objects as possible around. A garage floor makes a decent working station.;
, If necessary use a rag with rubbing alcohol to clean the spot thoroughly.

, If the gouge is still rough around the edges, a piece of sandpaper will clean the area up well.

, After a few moments you will notice little droplets of burning liquid dripping from the flame.

, When the gouge has been filled, blow out the flame on the PTEX stick.

Use the right length poles.,
Keep your arms in front of you.,
Separate upper and lower body movements.,
Pole plant at the beginning of a new turn.,
Flick your wrist forward.,
Plant the pole.,
Move your arm forward.,
Keep a steady rhythm.",How to Pole Plant," There’s no hard and fast rule for pole length; it’s determined by your height, your proportions and how you ski. Pole plants are essentially ineffective if your ski poles are too short. It’s best to get poles that are a bit longer than you think you need. If they end up being too long, you can then cut them down to size., To preserve a good sense of balance, it’s important to keep your arms steady, hands out in front of you. Imagine that you’re sitting in an armchair, your hands on the armrests. You should maintain this position as you ski, especially through the pole plant., In order to perform your turns and pole plant effectively, your upper and lower body should move independently. Your upper body should face downhill the whole time. Meanwhile, your lower body will be pointed in the direction you want to be moving. As you pole plant, your lower body will shift and turn, but your upper body should be straight., The pole plant allows you to readjust your bodyweight as you turn, taking it off of your heels and towards your toes. In slalom, you’ll be alternating rapidly, pole planting at the end of each turn to start the next one. Practice often to get the timing right.

You should always be using the downhill pole when pole planting., Cock your wrist and the downhill pole should be sent forward. Try to reach as far as possible without moving your arm. If you try to plant by flailing your arm or doing any other big movement, you’ll end up losing your balance and making your turn more difficult., You don’t have to stab at the ground or try to bury the pole into the snow. The pole should just graze the snow. That’ll be enough to help you shift your weight and make a new turn.

Once the pole touches the snow ahead of you, your wrist should be back in alignment with your forearm. Don’t keep your wrist cocked., As soon as you plant, your weight will start shifting forward and your skis will start to turn around the pole. Shifting your arm forward allows the pole tip to leave the snow gradually and return to the starting position., Pole planting regularly will help you ski more smoothly, and you’ll be more prepared to deal with any surprises on the hill. You can count in your head, pole planting at each 5 second interval for example. The exact amount of time between pole plants will vary, especially in a race."

Determine which kind of grip the ball is drilled for.,
Pick the ball up using both hands.,
Cradle the ball in your off-hand.

,
Insert your middle and ring fingers into their corresponding holes first.,
Insert your thumb into the thumb hole.,
Release your thumb from the thumb hole just before completing your forward swing.,
Release your other fingers from their holes at the moment you complete your forward swing.

",How to Hold a Bowling Ball," Although some bowling balls have no finger holes at all, most bowling balls have 2, 4, 5, or, most commonly, 3 finger holes.The distance between the thumb hole and the other finger holes determine which kind of grip the ball has been drilled for.


The conventional grip is the most common pattern for drilling the ball holes, and is the form of grip most house balls are drilled for. It places the holes for the middle and ring fingers of the bowling hand closer to the thumb hole than the other two grips, and is designed to help new bowlers and those with physical challenges develop a feel for the ball.
The fingertip grip places the middle and ring finger holes the furthest from the thumb hole, and the finger holes are usually shallower than the finger holes in the conventional grip. The fingertip grip is designed to give the experienced bowler more control over the ball, allowing the bowler to hook or curve the ball into the pins to knock them down more easily.
The semi-fingertip grip is a compromise between the conventional and fingertip grips, in that the distance between the finger holes and the thumb hole is less than that for the fingertip grip but more than that for the conventional grip. It is designed for professional bowlers who need to dampen the action of their balls or for experienced bowlers with physical challenges who want to want the control of a fingertip ball.
The Sarge Easter grip is also a compromise between the conventional and fingertip grips, but it achieves that compromise in a different way than the semi-fingertip grip. The thumb and index finger holes are placed as in the fingertip grip, but the ring finger hole is placed as in the conventional grip. This grip reduces the ball’s rotation and hooking ability, as well as the stress on the ring finger.;
, While the thumb and finger holes are meant for gripping the ball when you’re aiming it toward the pins, they aren’t meant for casual lifting of the ball. Place your hands on either side of the ball, perpendicular to the tracks of the ball return unit, and lift the ball evenly.

,, This is a commonly accepted practice that helps you set up your grip properly.Your fingers should apply only light gripping pressure to the sides of the holes.


If your ball is drilled for a conventional grip, your fingers should be inserted to the second knuckle.
If your ball is drilled for a fingertip grip, your fingers should be inserted to the first knuckle.
If your ball is drilled for a semi-fingertip grip, your fingers should be inserted to halfway between the first and second knuckle.
If your ball is drilled for a Sarge Easter grip, your index finger should be inserted to the first knuckle and your ring finger should be inserted to the second knuckle., Regardless of the grip your ball has been drilled for, your thumb should go to the second knuckle in the thumb hole. As with your other fingers, your thumb should grip the sides of the thumb hole with only light pressure, lighter in fact than the finger holes.Keep the pressure constant and consistent as you swing the ball backward and then forward.

, Releasing your thumb just in advance of finishing your swing imparts the rotation that causes your ball to hook when it nears the pins.


At the moment your thumb releases the ball, it should be pointing in the direction the ball will go when you release it completely.,"

Determine the skiing ability of all members who intend to form a part of the group.,

Have adequate head, face and hand protection.",How to Organize a Backcountry Ski Trip," You need to know the skill level of the least experienced member of your group. This person determines how hard you can push everyone and the type of terrain and length of the skiing trip that you can propose. As with a hike, the slowest and least capable person determines the group's entire pace and if there is a skier incapable of skiing certain terrain, this can become a liability if not accounted for at the outset. Determining basic expertise level will ensure that the trip is safe and enjoyable for all.


It is okay to include a challenge for members willing to undertake to push themselves that bit further. However, you all need to know and recognize that this is what is intended and still make allowances for it.;
, Be prepared to put in decent effort and time in finding an appropriate location. The location should not only match the abilities of all group members but should be a place that provides everyone with a chance to enjoy the great outdoors, learn something new and even push themselves a little.

, Contact local outfitting companies for information regarding avalanche risks during particular times of the year. They should also be able to provide guidance as to weather trends and regional affordability.

, Those who have never gone skiing in the backcountry should consider taking a community class to ensure safety. This will enable them to learn rescue actions, understand what to do when you get lost and coping with dangers such as avalanches. If you don't have access to a class, arrange a night or a few nights for learning from the more advanced members of the group. Use YouTube videos to demonstrate dangers and rescue techniques, as well as physically practicing some of these techniques.


Backcountry skiing training and safety classes are often offered at local universities and even some outdoor recreation stores. These classes can be taken for a reasonable fee, although the purchase of some safety tools may be required.

, Be sure to leave a note with a trusted friend or family member regarding the location of the ski trip, the estimated length of the vacation and the time the participants are expected to return home. This information can be essential for rapid outdoor rescue in the event of an emergency.

, You have the option of your own transport or catching public transportation, depending on what is available. Some things to consider include:


If you are driving, is your car roadworthy for snow and ice? Do you have snow tires and/or chains? Is the car in good condition?
Is there a need for more than one car? Would it make sense to hire a bigger vehicle and share the costs around?
If you are taking public transportation, what will you need to do about getting to any out-of-the-way locations once you arrive at the main town or location near that area?

, You'll need room for the ski gear, any food/drink, changes of clothing and, of course, the passengers.

, Presuming you arrive at a nearby town to begin with, a motel is probably a good start. As a group, you might be able to get a group discount at a nearby motel but equally, since you are a group, you will probably need to book ahead to ensure that you all get a place.

, When you're actually skiing backcountry, if your trip is more than the day, you'll need overnight shelter. Find out what huts are in the area you're skiing and how to book them or use them. This will also affect your route planning, as clearly you'll need to factor in the location of huts if using them.

, Tents are a possibility if the conditions are right and all members of the group know how to winter camp. This can be tough on everyone and there are risks, such as avalanches and severe cold, so each member must be aware of what to do to create a safe camp.


Snow caves are an option but are very tiring to build. They are best kept for an emergency.

, At least two members of the group, and preferably all members of the group, should know how to map read and find their way with a compass. GPS might not work where you are going.


Does the map show skiing routes at all? These are handy to make use of.
Look online for suggestions from others who have already skied the area. Learn from their experiences to guide your own. In particular, find out about potential hazards and how to avoid these.
Contact the local parks office or tourist office to find out more information.

, Once you have the map and background information that you need, plan a route that is doable by all members of the group. Factor in everyone's skill, the time it normally takes and add a little extra time for safety.


Are there any features you want to see while on the trip, such as a photography opportunity? Include these in the route planning.
Do not plan to push on after dark; while headlamps can show some of the way, this is dangerous and it is the time for resting and regaining your energy.

, Include high fat content food, such as chocolate, energy bars, jerky and nuts. Carry a small stove suitable for winter cooking to allow you to heat up meals for lunch and dinner; the camping package meals are ideal.


Water bottles should be insulated to prevent the water from freezing. You do need to drink often when skiing, even if it doesn't feel like it.

, This will help you to plan what food to carry.

, If someone is able to carry more due to greater strength, that is fine but it is important that everyone has some form of food on them, just in case they get separated.

, If you don't already know what to wear, a reputable sports store that outfits skiers will be able to advise you. For a long trip, changes of clothing will be required but even for a day trip, a spare pair of socks and extra gloves can't hurt to carry.

, These areas will be your Achilles heel if not properly covered while skiing. Balaclavas are a good choice for the head, as they cover both face and head and there are many modern fabrics and designs to choose from.


Many skiers choose to layer gloves and mittens for optimal warmth.
Helmet wearing is dependent on the speed and type of skiing the group will be doing. Discuss this with your group ahead of the trip.

Decide whether to go for one pin or two.,
Position yourself eight boards from the center.,
Aim for the center arrow.,
Bowl hard.,
Spin the ball.",How to Deal With a 7 10 Split in Bowling," You probably came here to learn how to hit both pins at once, but even pro bowlers have an extremely low chance to achieve this on a 7-10 split. If picking up one point leaves you in a competitive position, just take it rather than risk scoring no points at all. Follow the instructions below to attempt a spare only when you need a ""Hail Mary"" to get you back in the game.

Going for one pin gets even better when you are following a strike, since the single ball will count double.;
, Most right-handed amateur bowlers stand at around the 30th board, feet aligned with the leftmost dot and ball aligned with the large dot at board 30. When you have a 7-10 split, move left to board 38, and aim at the 10 pin. If you are a left-handed player, you would instead move eight boards right (to board 22) and aim at the 7 pin.

This article counts the boards from right to left. Don't get confused if you are used to the left-handed counting system, which counts from left to right.
If you do not normally stand at board 30, you can move eight boards from your usual starting point instead. However, for this shot, it may be easier to stand where the average person would, on board 38 or 22.

, Aiming for an arrow is much easier than aiming for a pin. Now that you are eight boards to the side of the center, you should be able to aim through the center arrow in order to hit the opposite pin.

If you moved eight boards from your usual starting position, instead aim for the arrow you would normally use to hit the center of the pins.

, Swing your arm in a long pendulum so the ball releases with a great deal of force. Your goal is to impart enough force into the target pin that it bounces off the kickback, then back to the other pin., Spin allows you to hook the ball, curving the path it travels along. You are more likely to score the spare if you can curve the ball into the side of the pin, slamming it against the nearest side wall.

If you add a significant hook to the ball, you may want to stand even closer to the edge of the lane.
Instead of hitting the pin against the kickback, some bowlers prefer to strike the pin on the gutter side, sending it onto the equipment at the center of the pit, then at the opposite pin. In this case, you should put an extreme amount of spin on the ball, and aim for the closer pin (7 for lefties, 10 for righties).

, The ski season ranges from mid-October to July 1st.

,,





The big resorts offer many accommodations to their guests and have more trails that are longer and usually have faster lifts than smaller resorts. There is a good selection of groomed and non-groomed ski runs as well as multiple mountains for those looking for more variety in their skiing experience.

The smaller resorts often are less busy than large resorts such as Monarch and Ski Cooper. Smaller resorts may be considered if you are looking for a calmer, more relaxing atmosphere and fewer crowds while skiing.



, After considering the following, you should have the resort or resorts that work best for you picked out.



Look at the different locations of the ski resorts you are considering on a map to see if any are near each other. For instance, Breckenridge, Keystone, and Copper mountain ski resorts are only about 20 minutes from each other.
It helps to look at resort websites to see what they have to offer and if there are any special deals. Follow one of the external links below to look at particular ski resorts.

Choose a resort that fits you and your plans. If there are beginners in the group you may want to make sure the ski school lessons fit into your schedule and budget.

Check out the vertical drop of the resort. Many resorts post this on their website. Vertical drop indicates, in general, how long your ski runs will be.
After considering all of these things, you should have a resort or some specific resorts that you want to ski at

, You and your party need to decide where you are staying during your ski trip. Choose between the following.





Staying at the ski resort is a great option and advantages are numerous. After a day of skiing all you have to do is go back to your place and relax. You can leave some of your gear at the condo and can stop back there for breaks, such as lunch. You will be able to go to the condo at your convenience.

Staying further from the ski resort will usually save you money. You might also be closer to entertainment and shopping centers or perhaps you could be in a more secluded area. The disadvantages of staying further away is that you will be further from the resort, which will add the hassle of getting to the ski slope with all of your equipment and you will need to have a car, or be near a bus station to get to the resort.



,





If you want lodging at the slope, you will usually have to go through the resort to book the reservations. Find the website for the resort and look at different lodging options. When you are happy with what you found, book it with a credit card and make sure it gets paid for in full when it is due.

If you chose to stay off the slope you should go through a company that will rent you a condo or hotel. Go on the internet, then move to a search engine and type the “Ski resort name” followed by “lodging.” When you look through the results look at several of the links that you have. Pick any options that you like and call about them. When you are happy with something you found, book it with a credit card and make sure it gets paid for in full when it is due.

Prevent the buildup of oil for easier cleaning.,
Moisten your rag with rubbing alcohol.As soon as you finish bowling, the ball will be warm from the friction of the lane.,
Clean the ball regularly.",How to Clean a Bowling Ball1," When the oil is fresh on your ball, it'll be easiest to wipe away. Wipe your ball after every game to maintain its condition. Keep a ball towel with your bowling gear for this purpose, and change it out after every time you play so oil doesn't build up on the cloth and transfer again to the ball.


Your ball towel, ideally, should be a lint free, microfiber cloth. Microfiber cloths will protect the finish of your ball, and lint free cloth will keep threads and pieces of cloth from rubbing onto your ball and influencing your game.
For the best results and the most consistent throws, towel off your ball after every shot. During prolonged play, you may want to swap in a clean towel at about the halfway point in your play.;
, This heat opens the pores on your ball, allowing you to clean the ball better.A little bit of alcohol goes a long way, so use it sparingly to wet your rag, then wipe down the entire surface of your ball.


After you have wiped down your ball with your alcohol dampened cloth, take a dry part of your towel or a fresh towel and wipe free any remaining moisture on its surface., The longer the oil sits on the surface of your ball, the more a chance it has to sink in and become harder to remove. This means that by cleaning your ball every time you bowl, your ball will stay cleaner for longer.This can save you a considerable amount in professional cleaning and help you bowl more consistently."

Wait until you've bowled a significant number of games.,
Tape up the finger holes on your bowling ball.,
Fill a bucket with hot water and insert your ball.,
Remove your ball, take off its tape, and dry it.",How to Clean a Bowling Ball2," This kind of deep cleaning is known among bowlers and pros as ""pulling the oil out of the ball."" Basically, this removes oil that has sunk deep into the pores of your ball over the course of many games. The number of games you should wait before deep cleaning will depend entirely on how frequently you play and the lanes you play on.


When playing on oily lanes regularly, you may want to have the oil pulled from your ball every 50 games. Better regulated lanes might only require your ball to be deep cleaned every 70 - 100 games.
When you start noticing the action of your ball on the lane to change, it's probably time for a deep cleaning., You'll want to use a waterproof tape to do this. Water that gets into the finger holes of your ball can harm its performance. Apply the tape over the holes and smooth it so it is flat and there are no gaps in the tape.


To ensure that no water gets into your finger holes, you may want to use an additional piece of tap per hole., Oil is lighter than water, so it and any accompanying dirt will lift from the surface of your ball when soaked in warm water. To allow the water enough time to work into the pores of your ball, soak your ball for 20 minutes., After your ball is finished soaking, it should be mostly clean. To prevent water on the surface of your ball from dripping into finger holes, keep the tape on the ball and use a clean, lint free towel or rag to dry the ball. When the ball is mostly dry, remove the tape and dry it again to remove any remaining moisture."

Bowl like a champion.",How to Clean a Bowling Ball3," Even if you're a pro bowler, it's unlikely that you'll have a specialized ball cleaning machine of your own. These machines are essentially tanks of water that heat to open the pores of the ball and remove deeply entrenched oil. You should be able to find one of these machines at most bowling pro shops., This service is usually relatively inexpensive, and having a professional clean and polish your ball all but ensures a thorough cleaning. Beyond that, your pro will be able to point out damage that you might otherwise not have noticed., The time it takes your pro shop to clean your ball may vary, but you can generally expect ball cleaning to take about an hour and a half. If you have a spare ball, this is just enough time for you to squeeze a few games in.Alternatively, you could run errands, tackle some chores, read a book, or play a handheld game while you're waiting. This way, you're not bored while your ball is cleaned.

, Now that your ball is cleaned and polished, it should have regained the same lane reaction as it did originally. Continue to wipe your ball with a towel after throws, and clean it after every game to maintain its condition.

Plastic (polyester) balls are often cheaper. These balls are perfectly acceptable for beginning or casual bowlers. This was the first type of coverstock introduced. The balls are easily handled but do not have much potential for spins or hooks.
Urethane balls have a better spin and more hook potential than polyester balls. They are still reasonably priced. However, they are more expensive than the plastic covered balls.
Reactive resin balls offer more control when it comes to spins and hooks. They are not as durable as urethane and plastic balls, but are better when it comes to power for strikes.
Particle coverstock bowling balls give you the most friction and reaction than any other coverstock. These balls are great for tournament bowlers who work with high-speed balls.







,


Bowling ball sizes range from 6 (2.72kg) to 16 (7.26kg) pounds.






Pro bowlers often use a ball that is just under 10 percent of their body weight.
Try different size balls until you find the right size. Begin with a smaller size and go up a pound until you find the highest weight can handle.

Your fingers should fit properly and comfortably in the holes.






It is recommended that you have your bowling ball holes custom drilled in order to acquire a perfect fit.

Learn to increase the amount of rotation you put on the ball.",How to Bowl with Reactive Bowling Balls," If you’re right-handed, slide the middle and ring fingers of your hand hand into the upper two finger holes. If you’re left-handed, insert the fingers of your left hand. The finger holes should come to a stop right around the first knuckle. This grip will be most effective for bowling precise angles.Using any other fingers won’t permit you to keep the ball centered in your hand.
Select a ball that doesn’t force you to stretch your hand. There should be enough room between your palm and the surface of the ball to fit a pencil.;
, Place your non-bowling hand flat against the opposite side of the ball. You’ll use this hand to steady the ball as you initiate the swing. Relying too heavily on the movement of your bowling hand can cause the ball to sway before the moment of release—this will throw off your shot.


Your support hand should remain on the ball until just before you roll.

, Rest your thumb flat against the outside of the ball to get it out of the way. Unlike a conventional roll where the thumb guides the ball during release, a proper hook shot requires the ball to be able to rotate slightly.Imagine that you’re cupping the ball with your thumb rather than pressing against it.
Tuck the ball against your wrist as you raise it behind you to help stabilize it.

, Keep your wrist straight but relaxed. To bowl a strike with a hook shot, it’s critical that you release the ball at exactly the right time and position. If you’re too tense, you’re more likely to neutralize the rotation of the roll or miss entirely.Try not to bring your arm out too far to the side. The ball should move within a few inches of your support leg when you bowl.

, Before you roll, make sure your stance is squared up and your head is facing forward. Bend your knees slightly to give yourself a solid base. Any shifting or tilting of the feet, waist or shoulders will rob your shot of accuracy.Start straight and finish straight.
Remember that the angle of the shot depends largely on the angle of your body.

, Glide smoothly into each step, keeping your head level as you travel forward. Raise the ball to face level, then bring it down and back behind you. As you prepare to release the ball, lower your hips and lean your upper body downward to put you closer to the lane.Let the ball’s natural momentum carry it through the swing—don’t force it.Most experienced bowlers take 4-5 steps during their approach. Any more than this may overcomplicate your throw and take your focus away from your technique., Just before releasing the ball, curl your middle and ring fingers together upward and to the side. The motion of these two fingers is responsible for generating rotation. Right-handed bowlers should turn the ball just slightly toward the left before it makes contact with the lane. Left-handed bowlers will twist the ball to the right.Your fingers should just graze the edges of the holes on their way out.
When you’re first learning to roll a hook, keep your rotation minimal. As you get accustomed to the motion, you can work on making your angles wider and your arc more pronounced., Continue extending your bowling arm forwards and upwards, even after the ball has left your hand. This will ensure that you don’t pull back too soon and choke the ball’s momentum. Finish the roll with your arm at about chest level, as though you were accepting a handshake.A good follow through is critical for a fast, accurate roll.
If your bowling arm is pointed downward at the lane when you complete your roll, you’re not following through enough.

, In order for the ball to strike near the middle of the pins following a curved hook, you’ll need to make sure it begins its path on the far side of the lane. As it travels down the lane, the inward rotation will cause it to pull in the opposite direction, moving it closer to the center.Approach from the side of the lane rather than trying to reach with your bowling arm.
Try to keep the ball inside the outermost arrow printed on the lane. Otherwise, it may accidentally spiral into the gutter., Keep your head up and your eyes on the pins as you complete your roll. Let the ball leave your hand in one smooth motion, making sure to withdraw your fingers from the holes quickly so that they don’t get in the way. Take care not to drop or fling the ball—it should fall no more than an inch or two before making contact with the lane.The lower your stance and angle of your upper body, the closer your bowling arm will be to the lane.
Because of the increased friction created by the shell of reactive bowling balls, it’s even more important that your release be seamless., When the ball enters from this “sweet spot,” it creates a sweeping action that knocks over the pins in the direction that they’re spaced. This is a much more efficient path than bowling straight on, which often leaves surrounding pins untouched.If you’re a right-handed bowler, the ball should enter right between the first and third pins (the pin in the front and the one just behind it to the right). Left-handed bowlers should aim between the first and second pins.
The oblique angle and rotation force of a hook shot makes it easier to clear pins, even if your aim is off by a little bit.

, The rotation you apply to the ball allows it to strike the pins at a precise angle and with greater force, but it also makes you more likely to miss. Start by throwing slight curves, then work your way toward more exaggerated hooks. After you’ve refined your control over the ball, you’ll be able to bowl strikes and spares effortlessly.The rotation should come from the movement of your fingers, not your wrist, arm or shoulder.Rolls with more rotation need to be counterbalanced by a faster speed to avoid curving off the lane.

Follow through.",How to Bowl Your Best Game Ever1," Bowling balls are all made differently, spinning and hooking at different rates. You want a ball you can comfortably raise and lower, but not so light you could throw it around with ease. It's always best to get a ball of your own instead of borrowing it or renting it, as you'll have a better fit and better results.


The average weight for adult men is 14lb and 13lb for women or smaller men. Children usually start at 12lbs.Make sure your fingers are firmly in the holes but come out without sticking. You shouldn't be squeezing your finger or thumb muscles to keep the ball on your hand, just lightly gripping it.
Balls come with a variety of ""Flare Potential"" and ""RG Radius"" ratings. These tell you how likely the ball is to curve back to the middle after a throw. The higher the ratings, the more the ball hooks. Think about your throw -- straight on or hooked, and buy accordingly.;
, Your bowling shoes are just like regular shoes-- they need to be taken care of and it's always best if they are your own. Good shoes have a smooth, regular sole and fit you comfortably. Get a half size bigger than your regular shoe size so that your feet are comfortable as you bowl.

, The most important thing is where you hold the ball. Put your fingers in the holes and balance the ball on your palm around stomach or chest height, using the opposite hand to support the weight. The ball should be slightly to the right side of your body in alignment with the right seam of your shirt (right handed bowlers). Your knees are slightly bent and your shoulders relaxed, and your left foot is on the big dot in the center of the lane (right-handers).


Keep your wrist strong so that the ball appears like a natural extension of your arm. You don't want your wrist to droop down towards the floor., There are seven arrows on the lane. Do not aim for the middle, as it usually leads to a split. If you're right-handed, aim for the arrow just to the right of the center. If you are left handed aim for the arrow just to the left. This mark is the best starting place for strikes.


If it is easier, move your feet to the right or left before you start approaching the lane so that your feet are lined up with the correct marker, then just throw straight ahead.
Almost all balls will hook, at least a little, and the lanes are designed for this. You want your ball to hit between the first pin and the next one in line behind it for strikes. This is called the ""pocket.""

, The classic move is the 4-step approach, landing with the foot opposite your throwing arm. For right-handers, step forward with your right foot, then comfortably walk forward so that your left foot lands within 6"" or so of the lane. Your right foot will then swing out of the way behind your left foot, allowing you to throw the ball freely. Practice a few times without the ball until you find a good starting spot that lets you arrive at the line, left foot down, every time. There are 2 lines of dots along the approach to the lane that are good starting points for you to begin.Practice taking 4 even steps each time, landing your left foot comfortably, before practicing the throw. You could also start at the foul line (beginning of lane), and walk four steps backward to determine the best starting spot for you.Reverse this is you are left-handed. The foot opposite your throwing arm should be planted at the lane. If you are left handed, you will land and plant with your right foot.

, As you take the first step of the approach, push the ball out in front of you so that your arm is extended. Use your left hand to support the weight of the ball as your hold it in front of you. The following steps will be for a right-handed thrower.


Remember to keep the ball out to the right side, not in the middle of your body.

, As you take the first step with your left leg, the ball will drop so that your right arm and left leg are roughly even. Keep your grip on the ball and let it fall freely. Your elbow will be slightly bent, but gravity is doing most of the work as the ball comes down.

, As you step again with your right foot, the ball will continue behind your body and up, reaching its apex as you plant your right foot. You will be swinging it back here.


Focus on keeping your wrist strong as you do this, not letting it rotate around.

, Come down with the ball, planning to release it as you pass your leg. Your right leg should swing behind the left leg, getting it out of the way for your shot. It doesn't have to swing way out, like a pro bowler, just out of the way enough that you don't hit it with the ball.

, As the ball leaves your fingers, snap them up as if you were closing your hands. Think of the children's game where you have a quarter in your hand and someone is trying to take it before you close your hand. You should release as the ball passes your planted leg, at its lowest point.Look at your mark when release. Don't look at the pins or you will get distracted and throw off key -- the arrows are your target, and the ball will do the rest. Remember you are aiming for the the first or second arrow to the right of the center arrow.

, To protect your arm, continue your arm back up on its arc towards your head. Think of drinking from a soda can, bringing your fingers and wrist up to head height.

Know where you want the ball to hit.,
Know how lane conditions affect your throw for strikes.,
Find your strike mark while warming up.,
Move your starting stance closer to the center as the lane dries up.",How to Bowl Your Best Game Ever2," Strikes are most common when the ball hits the ""pocket,"" the space between the front center pin and the next pin behind it, directly. For right handed bowlers this means curving the ball so it strikes right between the front pin and the second pin on the right. This scatters the front set of pins, cascading them into all of the pins behind them.More power means the pins scatter faster, potentially knocking over more pins.
Curving the ball is essential to hit consistent strikes. Remember to work on snapping your fingers and wrist as you follow through.
Left-handers want to hit between the front pin and the left pin in the second row.

, An unknown secret of bowling is that every lane is a little different. Lanes are oiled up so that the ball glides straight over the wood without hooking constantly. When the ball is in less oiled, or ""dry"" areas, it tends to hook more, taking it off the line you threw it on. To make matters even more complicated, the lane patterns will change throughout the game. But bowling your best game ever requires you to read the lane and adjust your shots accordingly, not throwing the same shot 23 times.The most common pattern is wet in the front and middle, and dry on the outsides and back, like a big triangle of oil pointing into the center of the lane. This means a throw to the outside will curve back to the middle, where a throw in the middle might not curve until the last second. This is why you aim out to the side, instead of down the center -- it cause the ball to move out, then curve back in right to the pocket.
As the day goes on, oil gets picked up by the balls, making the lane drier and causing the shots to hook more.
Many tournaments have ""alternate"" oil patterns that force you to change your shots to get strikes. Ask to see an oil pattern or warm-up with different angles and starting positions to find your strike mark., Starting in the center and throwing for the arrow just to the right of center (right-handers) is a great starting place to learn strikes, but you need to adjust it for your personal thrown. Make sure you watch the arrow you throw at, not the pins. If you are hitting your mark, but still missing the pocket, you should move your starting position.If your ball is going too far to the left, move 2-3 boards to the left. This means your throw will angle more to the right, giving it more time to curve back to the left.
If your ball is moving too far to the right, move your feet 2-3 boards to the right. This will get your ball out of the oil, allowing it to curve more back to the center.
If you still have trouble, or the ball is hooking a ton, move your mark to the right or left. The closer to center your mark is, the less the ball will hook. However, you should move your starting position first.

, Near the end of a game, especially with a big group, you may notice your normal shots are hooking more to the center and you're missing the pocket. As you notice your shots curving more to the center, move 1-2 boards to the left (right-handed throwers) and keep throwing at your normal mark, the arrow just to the right of the center arrow. Focus, again, on having the center of the ball hit this mark, not on the pins. If you're hitting your mark but still missing pins, move your feet starting position to accommodate.This extra hook happens because the balls pick up oil throughout the game, removing it from the lane and causing it to dry out. A dry lane hooks more.

Understand how scoring works to plan your shots well.,
Remember that speed makes it easier to pickup spares.,
Lower, or ""weaken,"" your wrist on your shot to get less spin and a straighter throw.,
Adjust your starting position based on your spare.,
Use the middle of the lane when trying to hit the far right and left pins.,
Aim for the most pins possible during a split.",How to Bowl Your Best Game Ever3," Knowing how bowling is actually scored helps you decide which pins to go for and when. The basics are easy -- there are ten pins, and each pin you hit is worth a point. However, spares and strikes are worth more than just 10 pins. Strikes (X) are worth 10 points, plus whatever you hit on the next two throws. Spares (/) are worth 10 points, plus whatever you hit on the next throw. This means a single frame can be worth more than 10 points if you get a strike or spare.For example, say you throw a strike in the first frame. In the second frame you hit 2 pins on the first throw and 3 on the next one for 5 total pins. Your first frame would be worth 15 points (10 for the strike, + 2 for the first throw and + 3 for the second). You still score, however, the 5 points from the second frame too. So your total score, after two frames, is 20 points (15+2+3).
If your throw three strikes in a row, your first frame is worth 30 points, 10 for the strike, plus 10 for the second frame and 10 for the third frame. You cannot score you second and third frames until you take another throw.
Spares add to your next shot only. So, if I throw a spare in one frame, then throw a gutter ball immediately after, my spare is only worth 10 points (10+0), no matter what I do after that. A spare followed by a strike is worth 20 points (10+10).
If you throw a strike or spare in the 10th frame you get a free shot at the end, making the 10th frame the only one with three potential rolls. Thus you should always go for the spare in the 10th frame.

, Higher speeds mean there is less time for the ball to react and turn off line. Practice a straight, consistent spare shot and you will beat many a people who throw the same shot every time. Everybody can strike. Not everybody spares.

, This provides a more accurate shot, as less spin means the ball will hook less. To weaken your wrist, start your shot with your wrist curved slightly down, towards the floor. On your follow through, don't let your wrist and fingers snap up as much. This may take some practice, but changing wrist positions is one of the most important skills for intermediate or advanced bowlers., By adjusting your starting position you can often throw right at your normal mark and still get a spare. The boards on the lane (thin wooden pieces running to the pins) are made to give you a measurement system for aiming. If you need to hit a pin left of the center, you move several boards to the right, and vice verse. You then throw at the same mark you aim at for strikes. The system is actually pretty easy to learn and is reversed for the opposite direction of throws.


If you want to hit the first pin to the left of the center, move your start position 3 boards to the right.
If you want to hit the second pin to the left of the center, move 6 boards to the right.

, Most lanes are the slickest in the middle. Oil is applied to lanes in complex patterns that determine how much a ball hooks -- more oil means less hook, or a straighter, more accurate shot. Since a right-hander going after the far right pins doesn't want the ball to curve to the middle, you should throw diagonally across center instead. This ensures a straighter flight, curving just a bit at the end to avoid the gutter and hitting all the pins.


For example, there may be one solo pin on the far right side of the lane. While you could try and hug the gutter, the ball will naturally want to spin to the center because the outside of the line is low on oil. Instead, start your walk from the far left of the lane, throwing the ball from the left diagonally, across the middle, to the far right pins.

, Unless you are skilled enough to hit the outside edge of a lone pin, shooting it like a missile at the pack of three pins in the back corner, you should take the sure-fire three pins. This is especially important if you threw a strike the previous frame, because any pins you hit now get counted twice, once for the strike and once in this frame.


If you didn't get a strike in the previous frame, you might be more likely to take a risk now, trying to get a spare to boost your score for later."

These boards can be both friend and enemy to you. Depending on the amount of oil and the way your ball reacts to different lane conditions, you will want to line up your feet slightly to the left-hand side of the lane. Once you get more familiar with your hook, you can adjust your set-up as necessary.


Starting with your right foot on the middle dot on the approach is a good way to test how much the lanes are hooking. It is important to keep your feet closely together to maintain alignment.;
, Take the amount of steps in your approach away from the lane to determine your starting position. If you have a 4-step approach take 4 steps, etc. You then want to aim to throw your ball at one of the arrows on the lane. The easiest way to aim is to use the arrow markings or the dots that are just before the arrows on the lane.


For this tutorial, you should start off aiming somewhere around the second arrow on the right, allowing the ball to roll over this arrow, move out to only a few boards from the gutter, and then hook from the dry spot of the lane (about 38 to 40 feet down on a house shot) all the way back to the 1-3 pocket.

For a left-hander, this would be the 2nd arrow on the left, and the ball would hook to the 1-2 pocket.



, A 4-step approach is recommended, though you can use as little as 1 step and as many as 8 (though most steps over 4 are basically just timing steps where your ball doesn't move). For a 4-step approach:


Push off the ball on your first step, stepping with your right foot first for right-handed players
Have the ball be parallel to your ankle at the 2nd step, and start to bend at your knees
Be at the top of your backswing by your third step
Bring the ball back through and release by the end of your slide.

With 5 steps, it's basically the same thing, only you'll start with your left foot instead, and the ball won't move for that first step.



, Having your arm tucked too far behind you or held too far away from your body will cause a bad angle when you release the ball. It's easiest to keep your arm straight if you adjust your push away.


There are many different styles, like bending at the waist (a la Walter Ray Williams Jr. or Wes Malott) or opening your shoulders (a la Tommy Jones or Chris Barnes) when you bring your arm up for the backswing, but sticking to the basics is a good idea when first learning how to do this.
Remember, you want the ball to hook when it gets to the dry area at the back of the lane, but until it gets there, the ball should be traveling a relatively straight path, varying only a few boards at most. Again, everyone has a different style, and you can adjust this as you feel comfortable.

, As you begin to drop the ball out of the backswing, make sure that your palm is directly underneath the ball, facing upwards. Now, as the ball starts to approach your ankle, you want to rotate the ball so that when you release your hand, it is on the side of the ball and slightly under it, just as if you were holding a football to throw an underhand spiral. Then follow through as though you were going to be shaking hands with the pins.


A good way to practice this technique is to actually throw an underhand spiral with a football; similar physics are involved. You can also practice with a tennis ball. If you get it right, it'll go straight and then bounce drastically to the side.

, Just as important as the release itself is following through with your arm after you let go of the ball. After release it is important to follow through outward onto the lane, not upward. Your fingers will create the upward lift without you having to lift upward on the ball.


An easy way to remember this is the old ESPN advert: ""Roll the ball, then answer the phone."" Though, hopefully you have better form than the guy in that commercial. And remember, fluidity here is essential: don't do the hand-shake, pause slightly, and then do the follow through -- it must all be one smooth motion. A good follow through is crucial to maintaining consistent ball speed and accuracy.

, Once you are comfortable with your release and can execute it properly on a consistent basis, you can learn to adjust your footwork in tandem with your release. On a house pattern, you want to move the direction you are missing.


For a right-hander, if your ball hits high (to the left of the headpin), then try moving your feet a couple of boards to the left and keeping your target on the lane the same as before.
If you hit the pocket light (to the right of the 3 pin), try moving your feet a couple of boards to the right and keep your target the same. It is important to move your target on the lane when you move your feet. Otherwise you may end up playing very weird angles.
Once you become more advanced and start playing on more challenging sport lane conditions, the left and right moves become more complicated and sometimes speed and hand adjustments are required.

, No matter what you do, if the bowling ball can't catch any friction on the lanes, it's not going to hook. Generally, you need a ball made of Reactive Resin or better (e.g. particle-load or newer epoxy resin cover stocks) for anything but the driest of lanes. These are very easy to find and can be bought at relatively little expense, though resin is more expensive than urethane cover stock and will be an investment in your game. Check out your alley -- how oily are the lanes?


Though most bowling centers do offer ""house balls,"" they are generally plastic (polyester) and won't hook very much, though they are good for most spares since they will travel very straight.
Having your own plastic ball for spares (spare ball), and a resin ball for strikes and some spares (spare ball) is a good idea for any level of bowler as house balls don't usually fit your hand perfectly and won't carry pins very well.

, When you're getting your ball custom-fitted to your hand, you want to know how you hold the ball, your point of axis, and how your grip lies. Grip the ball with the two middle fingers (the middle and ring fingers) of your dominant hand (i.e. the hand you write with), and place your thumb the whole way into the thumb hole. There are 2 main types of grips:



Conventional: the middle and ring fingers are inserted up to the second knuckle (this is seen in most house balls)
Fingertip grip: the same fingers are inserted only up to the first knuckle (fingertip grips will give you more revs than a conventional grip and are easier to hook)

A new thing out these days in the bowling community are Vacu-Grips. These grips will expand and contract to your finger width; this helps if you are going to bowl a lot. You will find that most of the pros use a fingertip grip as it allows you to get your thumb out of the ball first allowing you to ""lift"" with your fingers creating revs on the ball.



, This is a personal thing depending on how and where you bowl, so you will need to talk to your local pro-shop operator for advice on this one. The drilling for the ball is very important, if not crucial, so make sure the drilling is appropriate for the conditions you bowl on and your own physical limitations. Obviously, it is critical that your own ball is fitted to your hand, but if you purchase a ball, the pro shop operator will do this as part of the cost of the drilling.


Talk to your pro-shop guy about your wants -- he may be able to recommend things you don't realize you need. Maybe a fingertip grip? A lower or higher RP differential (lower differential hooks on pearl or matte coverstock, higher on resin)? Or even a different ball or different weight completely!

Start with the right stance and grip.,
Always focus on the arrow on the lane that you want to hit.,
Start your approach like you would a straight shot.,
Release the ball at the bottom of your swing, pulling your thumb out before your fingers.,
Rotate your fingers up along the outside of the ball as you release, directing the ball's spin with your fingers.,
Learn to control the degree of your curve by varying the ball's position and timing your release.,
Use a tennis ball to practice.,
Use a bowling ball that is a few pounds lighter than the ball you would normally use as you're learning.,
Think of it like spiraling a football, only upside down.,
If you're using a house ball, know that it could be very difficult.,
Get a ball with a fingertip grip.,
Get your own ball with a urethane or resin coating.,
If you're considering getting your own ball, ask about RG ratings and coverstock.",How to Curve a Bowling Ball," You want to be several inches from the foul line and preferably at least four steps away from your release. Some people take longer and that's fine -- but at least four steps is ideal. Line your feet up with the arrow on the lane you are aiming for (which will depend on how hefty your curve is).









If you have your own ball, you probably know how to grip it. However, if you're working with a house ball, you may need to adjust your style. House balls generally have knuckle grips -- you want your fingers (and especially thumb) to come out swiftly, so don't jam them in there. Hold the ball so it aligns straight with your wrist. Hand positions are covered later on in this article; it's more important during your swing than before.;
, Never focus on the pin you are aiming for. It is a lot easier to hit a mark that is ten feet in front of you than one that fifty. The arrow you want to hit will vary on lane conditions (wet vs. dry). To change the aim it is easier to change where you stand at the start than to change the arrow. If you are missing to the left, move your starting point to the left and vise versa. It sounds counter intuitive, but if you move to the left and hit the same arrow the ball will go farther right at the beginning before swinging to left. There are dots on the floor to help you adjust. Moving your feet over just one board can be the difference between a strike and the dreaded 7-10 split.








, Your approach is the same as any standard shot -- the change is in your follow-through, and mostly in your hand. Bring the ball back into the swing position while keeping your palm behind the ball, just as you normally do.









Be sure to keep your wrist strong. If you carry too much of the weight on your wrist or twist it back and forth, you could hurt yourself -- or at the very least wear yourself down before your frames are up.

, The idea behind the hook is at the very end, your fingers are the only thing containing the ball, and they spin it as it releases -- hence why your thumb needs to get out of the way. Here are a few hand position options:









The standard way to hook the ball is to place your two fingers and thumb in the three holes as normal. In other words, change nothing.
Some people choose to not put their thumb in the ball at all, and instead sort of cup the ball on their palm and/or wrist as they swing the ball back and release it in the follow-through. And yet a few choose to only place one finger (the index finger) in the slot and palm the ball, spinning in the same motion on the release. However, you risk the ball turning in your grip, and that can lead to sprained wrists and fingers.

, Continue moving your hand up on your swing to direct the ball down the lane, finishing in a handshake position. Ideally, you want to go from a 4 o'clock position to a 7 o'clock position.









The ball should be totally out of your hands by the seven o'clock position, and your arm should follow through to the 12 o'clock position with your hand up by your ear all while your eyes are lock on the arrow you are trying to hit.
Try hard not to subconsciously decelerate your swing in an effort to concentrate on and nail your hook; the same power is still needed. Or if you do, account for the differential; when you resume your normal throw, the hook could be very different.

, To increase the degree of the curve, release your fingers from the ball more rapidly. Your counterclockwise motion could also be more (or less) drastic.









With a little practice you will know if you've thrown a good ball or not by how close the arrow you are.
If you're not getting it, isolate the variables and experiment with each one alone. Try starting from a different start spot. Try switching up your footwork. Heck, experiment with different balls. It's possible that your wrist and hand positioning is just fine and there's another element that's mixing it up.

, A great way to practice your hook shot without having to make an embarrassing trip to the bowling alley is to practice with a tennis ball. It'll go straight when you throw it, but when it hits the bounce, it'll veer off to the side -- if you're doing it right, of course!









Another option is a pool ball, but the damage potential of nearby objects is a bit more substantial!

, A lighter ball allows you to focus on learning the new throwing technique. While you definitely want to get up to your normal ball sooner rather than later, the lighter ball can help you concentrate on what your hands should be doing. Just don't get too used to it!








, If you have experience spiraling a football, it's the same general principle. Just under-handed! Your fingers move along the side of the ball in much the same way. Just think of throwing a football underhanded, trying to maintain the same spin. It starts cupped in your hand, and the last point of contact is with the tips of your fingers as it spins off.








, Those balls at the bowling alley are meant for straight shots; hooking them could require different, more outrageous methodology to get the same, natural hook effect. So if you don't have your own, don't stress! It could be your equipment.









The general rule of thumb is that you choose a ball that's 10% of your body weight. If you're 160 pounds, choose a 16-pound ball.That is, if you're of normal health and have no reason why a lighter ball would be more down your (bowling) alley.

, Certain balls (most house balls) come with knuckle grip, where the holes go down to your second knuckle. But a fingertip grip is much more conducive to throwing a hooked ball -- since your thumb and fingers have to come out, the actions are a lot swifter and smoother.








, A urethane coverstock on your bowling ball will make your hook shot so much easier; they don't absorb oil from the lane and they provide way more friction than your standard plastic ball (the house ball). Those two things combined set that hook up for success.









A resin coating can actually dig into the oil in the lane, upping the chance that you hit exactly where you're aiming for. But they're quite an investment and only for the most serious of bowlers.

, A ball with a high differential of RG rating will create a really sharp hook. However, you could have a ball with a low differential, so long as it has a matte-finish coverstock to combat lane oil. If you're dealing with a dry lane (at your home alley, that is), consider a stiff or pearl coverstock.









So many options! When in doubt, explain your situation to the assistant. As long as you give them all your variables and what you'd like to do, they can find the perfect ball for you.
Don't choose a ball drilled to your fingers and with your axis point until you have your hook down. As you get better at it, your hook changes. So wait it out! You want a ball that's all your own when you're at your peak.

There are normally many ""house balls"" to choose from and these are supplied, free-of-charge, by the bowling alley. Shoes may be rented for one price which covers your entire bowling session.


The other option is get your own ball and have it custom-fitted to your hand for your individual swing and release. The fitting and drilling can often be accomplished on the spot (if the resident pro is in the bowling center at the time). The pro will be able to advise you on the best ball composition and weight for your skill level, budget, bowling style, and aspirations.
You might be able to find a bargain ball online or in a local store, but you will likely have trouble sorting all the options and should expect to pay the pro to fit you and drill the ball. It is not recommended to get your ball fitted and drilled at a box store unless they specialize in sporting equipment, and, in particular, bowling supplies. If you buy from the pro shop, though, you will have free advice and free drilling.;
, If you purchase your ball, you will have two basic choices:


The conventional grip where the middle and ring finger go into the ball up to the second joint of each finger. This is the only grip option if you are using a ""house ball."" In this option, a custom ball is drilled to accommodate the natural slant of your fingers in relation to each other and to the radius of the ball. Don't worry about this, though.—The pro will take care of all the measurements and should make adjustments over your next few bowling sessions. There should be no charge for the adjustments, but ask just to be sure.
The fingertip grip in which the middle and ring finger go into the ball only up to the first joint. The fingertip grip affords more leverage at release, allowing you to put more ""juice"" on the shot—that is, impart more revolutions on the ball per unit time. Normally, with a fingertip grip, there will be rubberized inserts in each finger hole. These afford a surer grip. Again, the pro will set you up and should make adjustments gratis.

, If you are purchasing your ball, the pro will take care of measuring your hand. Have the pro watch a couple of your shots. That way the fit will account for your natural delivery style. If you have not bowled before, you might want to get a bit of instruction before showing the pro your shot. If you ask, the pro will give you a quick run-down on the basics and get you started off on the right foot. In the meantime, finish reading this article to get a basic idea of the fundamental bowling swing which will get you strike after strike after strike.


Undoubtedly the pro will offer you the opportunity to purchase a bag and recommended accessories. You can purchase these on the spot or wait and see what turns up in the local thrift shops. Often bowling equipment shows up in good shape and you can pick up a ball for the kids and a bag for yourself. Really all you need at this point is a bowling ball sling, also known as a buffer bag.

, It is mandatory that you use shoes specially designed for bowling. These have medium-soft, rubber heels which stop you smoothly, but quickly at the release point. The soles are of leather and are designed to slide smoothly across the approach boards as you prepare to release your shot. Rental shoes are available at the desk and are normally paid for when you get your lane assignment.


If you plan to join a weekly bowling league, house shoes are often included with the weekly fees. Ask about this. If your center does not include free shoes for leagues, you will save money, overall, by purchasing your own shoes right away. They will be available in the pro shop or you can shop for bargains around town and online.
A word of caution about the shoes: Take care not to step in any liquid or spills. Bowling shoes are designed to slide smoothly right until the release. If you step in water, for example, your slide will stop soon as it starts, which is dangerous and may cause injury.

, Balls come in various weights which will likely be stamped into the balls. Alternatively, the balls will be color-coded. For the color-coded option, the key should be posted conspicuously in the bowling center. If not, ask at the desk.



Determine the proper starting weight. Pick a ball which seems fairly light. Holding the ball cradled in both hands, extend your arms fully in front of your chest. If you can hold the ball for only a couple of seconds without straining, you have found a good starting weight. If the ball wants to drop as soon as you push it away from your body, the ball is too heavy.—Try something a bit lighter. If you can hold the ball at arm's length for quite some time, the ball is way too light. You want the heaviest ball that you can reasonably control. If it is too light, you will be able to jerk it this way and that during the swing and you will have inconsistent results.

Select a ball with the proper span. Support the ball with your non-dominant hand underneath. Insert the thumb of your bowling hand (your dominant hand) into the largest diameter hole and drape your middle finger and ring finger over the two remaining holes.

Look for something where the crease of the second joint of both fingers is just over the edge of each hole. If the finger holes are too far away and the edge of the hole falls between your first and second joint, you will not be able to seat your fingers into the holes all the way.—The span is too great. On the other hand, if the span is too small, the palm of your hand will not rest on the ball surface and you will, necessarily, adopt a pincher grip. This is not a power grip and will result in a weak shot and relatively few strikes.
Take the time to find at least one ball with a proper, comfortable span for your hand. If you are having a truly difficult time finding a ball of your targeted weight that has the proper span, there is a strong possibility that you have picked a weight that is too heavy or light. The heavier balls will normally have a larger span, so you will need to look at balls that are heavier or lighter according to your needs. If you are having trouble, ask the bowling center staff for assistance. They will help you arrive at a reasonable compromise for weight and span.



Select the best finger hole size. If you have identified several balls of the proper starting weight and span, look for the one with the snuggest, most comfortable finger holes. Typically, the finger holes are drilled over-large. If you are finding that your fingers do not fit in the balls, you have chosen a weight that is too light, perhaps a kid's weight with proportionately smaller finger holes. You want holes which are fairly snug, but release your fingers easily.

, Stand with your back to the pins and your heels at the foul line. Take four and a half normal steps toward the scoring area and note the location where your toe-tip ends. Generally this will be between the five round dots and the start of the approach.









If you find that your normal steps take you off of the alley, your will have to start with your heels hanging a bit off the raised approach area and start with smaller steps, building your pace and the length of your steps as you get closer to the foul line. In this way you will avoid going over the line which stretches from gutter to gutter (at the start of the gutter).
If you go over the foul line or any part of your body touches the lane past this line, your pin fall is not counted and the pins are reset. However, you still lose your shot (two per frame, maximum, but possibly three shots in the tenth frame only.)

, Before you start rolling strikes in every frame, you'll need to figure out the best possible position from which to start your approach. Your non-dominant foot will be whichever is opposite your bowling hand. If you bowl right, this will be your left foot. Put your left foot forward, aligned just behind the center dot.


Eventually, you can adjust your starting alignment based on your natural tendencies, but to start out and gauge your aim, try starting in the center.

, About fifteen feet from the foul line, you'll see the directional arrows that help you aim.









The center of the lane is generally the most oily part. Keeping the ball somewhat to the side is a good way to maximize your traction on the lane.

, Bowl naturally, keeping your shoulders parallel with the foul line and swinging your arm forward as straight as possible. Follow through when you release. Your hand should extend as if you were going to shake someone's hand. Pay careful attention to where the ball lands.









The ""pocket"" is the area immediately to one or the other side of the lead pin, and is the area you want to hit to consistently roll strikes. Did you hit the pocket? If so, you've found the correct starting position for your swing. You'll want to align your non-dominant foot with the center dot.

, If you missed right, start your next throw a dot to the right of the center point. If you missed left, do the opposite. While this may seem counter-intuitive, missing to one side means that your ball is hooking too early or too late. Keep the ball dead on by moving toward your miss.









After several practice throws you should be able to find your optimum starting position from which to bowl. From there, you can tweak your throw to improve your chances of hitting a strike every time.

, Pro bowlers all bowl with some ""English,"" or curvature on the ball. Because the pocket you're aiming for is somewhat on an angle, the best way to hit it is to curve the ball in toward the pocket from the edge of the lane. This is why you aim for an arrow to the side of the center.









The best way to ensure English on your throw is to maintain good ""handshake"" position on your follow-through. After you release the ball, your hand should be up in the air as if you were going to shake the hand of the pin you're aiming toward., Using a ball that is too heavy or too light can drastically affect your accuracy. Experiment with balls that are slightly heavier than what feels normal and balls that are slightly lighter than you would normally use. Does your accuracy improve in either direction?







, Firing the ball from the rocket launcher that is your bowling arm may seem like a good idea at first, but it's not necessarily the most accurate way to throw. Extra force will often leave pins on the floor that softer and more accurate throws will pick up. In general, though, you should throw the ball with as much force as you can throw accurately.









Some modern alleys track the speed of your ball. Try to reduce the speed of your shot in small increments if you are blowing the pins off the lane. Slower, precise pocket hits will keep the pins on the lane and allow them to mix, improving your chance of clearing the deck and producing a strike.

, Gripping too tightly, particularly with the thumb, can hook the ball in an inaccurate direction. Insert your fingers into the ball first. If you've got an appropriately fitted bowling ball, they should go in as far as your big knuckle. Use your non-bowling hand to steady the ball on your approach.









You'll typically want the thumb to release the ball a split second before the fingers. Make sure your fingernails are neat and trimmed to avoid catching on the fingerholes and throwing wonky balls.

Try to keep the score accurate.",How to Bowl," Before you begin to bowl, you have to understand the function of the bowling lane. A bowling lane is 60 feet (18.3 m) long from the foul line, the line closest to the bowler, to the head pin, the pin closest to the bowler. There are gutters on either side of the bowling lane. If a ball veers off the lane, it goes into the gutters and is out of play.


The approach area is 15 feet (4.6 m) long and ends at the foul line. The bowler cannot overstep the foul line during their approach or their shot won't count.
If a ball goes into the gutters and then bounces out and hits the pins, it won't count.;
, Ten pins are arranged at the end of the bowling lane at the beginning of every frame. They are arranged in a triangle formation, with the point of the triangle facing the bowler. There is one pin in the first row, which is the head pin, two pins in the second row, three in the third, and four in the fourth.The locations of the pins are assigned numbers 1-10. The pins in the back row have the numbers 7-10, the pins in the row above the back row are numbered 4-6, the pins in the second row are numbered 2-3, and the head pin is pin 1.
All pins will earn the bowler one point if they are hit. The numbers are based on location, not value.

, Before you can call yourself a true bowler, you should be aware of a few different bowling terms. Knowing these terms will also make it much easier for you to understand the rules. Here they are:


A strike is when you knock down all the pins with the ball on your first try.
A spare is when you knock down all the pins on your second try.
A split is when the first ball of a frame knocks down the headpin (the pin closest to you) but leaves two or more pins that are non-adjacent. It's tough to hit a spare in this situation, especially if you have a 7-10 split, which is the hardest split to hit.
A turkey is three strikes in a row.
If any pins remain after the bowler's turn, it's called an ""open frame.""

, One bowling game consists of 10 frames. Each frame is equal to one turn for the bowler. The bowler's objective is to knock down as many pins as possible in a frame, ideally all of them.


A bowler can roll the ball twice in each frame, provided that they do not hit a strike.

, If a bowler has an open frame, then they simply get credit for the number of pins they knocked down. If a bowler knocked down 6 pins after two turns, they simply get two turns. However, if a bowler hits a spare or a strike, the rules get slightly more complicated.If a bowler hits a spare, then they should place a slash mark on their score sheet. After their next turn, they will receive 10 points plus the number of pins they knock down with that turn. So if they knock down 3 pins after their first turn, then they will get 13 points before their second turn. If they then knock down 2 pins in their second turn, they get a total of 15 points for that round.
If a bowler hits a strike, they should record an X on their scoresheet. The strike will earn the bowler ten points plus the number of pins knocked down on the player's next two turns in the following round.
The most a bowler can score in one game is 300 points. This represents 12 strikes in a row, or 120 pins that were knocked down in 12 frames. A perfect game has 12 strikes and not ten, because if the bowler gets a strike on the last frame, then they can take two more turns. If those two turns are also strikes, they will have 300 points.

If a player rolls a spare in the last frame, then they can take one more turn.



, Go online to find a local bowling alley that suits your needs. Try to find a place that offers bowling lessons or has beginner bowling leagues.


If you want to go bowling with friends, find a place that's rated for having a fun environment and maybe some food and snacks as well.

, Talk to the fellow bowlers and staff, and see if you can even join a game. Alternately, you can go to an alley with a group of friends. If you ask a crowd if you can join their game, make sure it isn't too competitive. You may even make new friends at the alley.

, If you're a beginner, you can just rent shoes at the alley. If you want to kick up your game, you can buy a pair of your own shoes. Street shoes won't work for bowling because they'll either make you stick to the floor instead of sliding naturally, or they'll make you slip too much and injure yourself.


If you don't wear bowling shoes, you can also damage or leave scuff marks on the alley floor. Rent a pair of shoes unless you want to get in trouble before you even start bowling.
Don't forget to wear socks or bring socks to the alley. Some alleys sell socks, but they will be expensive.

, Before you can begin to bowl, you need to find a ball that is the right weight for you and which is the right size for your fingers. The balls will be labeled based on their weight, so a ball with ""8"" written on it will weigh 8 pounds. Here's how to find a ball of the right size and weight:Weight. A 14-16 lb ball would work for most adults with bigger hands, and a 10-14 lb ball would work for most adults with smaller hands. Generally, it's better to have a ball that is a little heavier because it will help you gain momentum. A general rule is that a ball should weigh 10% as much as your body, so if you weigh 140 pounds, you should bowl with a 14 lb ball.
Size of the thumb hole. Your thumb should fit snugly into the single thumb hole. You should be able to take it out of the hole without it snagging or getting stuck, but the hole shouldn't be so large that you have to squeeze your thumb in the hole to hang on.
Size of the middle finger holes. Once you've inserted your thumb, you should lay your middle and ring finger across the other two holes. If the span is correct, your two fingers should easily and comfortably lay over the two holes so the middle joint lines up with the side of the hole closest to your thumb. Curl your two fingers into the holes to make sure they fit snugly in the hole like your thumb.

, Once you've signed up at the alley and put on your shoes, you will be directed to a bowling lane. If you get to choose your lane, pick a lane that is away from loud or noisy people. But it's your choice: you may be able to bowl better if you're surrounded by other bowlers.

, First, pick up your ball and head to the right spot in front of the bowling lane. Place your middle and ring finger in the top 2 holes and place your thumb into the bottom hole.


Hold the ball slightly to your side with your bowling hand underneath the ball and your other hand resting on the bottom side of the ball for extra support.
Keep your thumb on top of the ball at 10:00 position if you're right-handed. Use the 2:00 position if you're a lefty.


, The standard approach consists of standing with your back straight, your shoulders centered squarely towards your target, and your knees slightly bent. Your ball arm should hand straight down by your side. Your back should be tilted slightly forward.


Your feet should be slightly apart and your ""slide foot"" should be placed slightly in front of the other foot. Your slide foot will be the opposite of the hand you use to bowl (a right handed bowler will slide with their left foot). 


, Your bowling lane should have a series of dots 7 feet (2.1 m) down the lane, and black arrows about fifteen feet down the lane. If you're a beginning bowler, you should aim to roll the ball in the center of these marks. Once you develop your bowling skills, you can aim to the left or the right of the marks when you hook the ball.


Even if you aim your ball through the center of the marks, you may not be able to hit the pins because the ball can slow down or roll off toward the gutters. Just notice where the ball rolls when you do and don't bowl a solid frame and adjust your aim accordingly.
Focus on aiming at the marks, not the pins. 


, Maintain a straight forward, non-twisting approach of your body, as your ball and hand position should be held relatively the same -- underneath and behind the ball during the swing. Swing your ball arm smoothly back and then forward to release the ball. Release the ball when your arm has moved as far forward as it can go.


When released properly, your thumb should come out first, followed by the fingers. This should help get rotation on the ball, which should help the ball hook and carry once it gets down the lane.
Keep your eye on the target you're aiming towards as you release the ball. If you look down at your feet or the ball, you will lose balance and won't be able to aim your ball correctly.

, Make sure your hands are completely dry before you pick up the ball to start bowl each time. Use a cloth to wipe your hands, or at least wipe your hands on your pants if you don't have one. If your hands are still sweaty, the ball can slip out of your hands.


You can also use rosin, which can be found in most pro bowling shops, to make your fingers and thumb slightly tacky and less slippery.

, Most bowling alleys will have a computer near the sitting area that allows you to keep score. If an alley doesn't have a computer, then you will be given a score sheet to record your scores. Either way, the process is the same. Here's how to keep score:


The area in the upper left of each frame is to record the first ball, and the box to the left is for the second ball and if you have a strike. A strike is marked with a ""X"" and a spare with a ""/"".


, The distance between the delivery line and you should be of about 6 inches if you want to have an optimal release. This means that the ball is lofted a small distance over the foul line before it makes contact with the lane. Thus, the ball gets further down the lane and it preserves energy when hitting the pins. Finishing too far from the foul line means you’ll have to move closer to it when you start in the stance.


Remember that a strike is 10 plus the next two balls, whereas a spare is 10 plus the next ball. If you strike in the first ball in the 10th frame, you get two more balls to determine your final score. 300 is the highest score you can get.

, Carefully observe the professionals and see what techniques they use. You can also watch video clips of expert bowlers online.


Try to imitate the bowler's stances in your own home. Just remember that you're watching experts, and that your bowling technique will be much simpler than theirs.

, If you want to really improve your game, seek out help from other, more advanced bowlers and from coaches. It will always help to have a critical eye watching you and you will gain new insight.

, This is a great way to keep up a regular practice and to make new friends.

,,,, Otherwise, the player who arrives first goes first.

, Bowling is a sport so play fair.

, Avoid any throwing or tossing of the, as it may damage the lane.

,,, Check your language and limit swearing as much as you can.

,, Almost all alleys have now automated score keeping.

List the attacks you want to improve your reaction against.,
Find a training partner.

,
Ask your partner to execute the attack slowly.,
Repeat the very same attack with the very same defense.,
Switch into another attack or into another defense (or both).,
Continue switching until you've successfully trained about 3 or 4 attacks and corresponding defenses.

,
Ask your partner to do one of the previously trained attacks at random.,
Repeat it all.,
Find more partners, or at least keep finding ways of using different attacks.,
Once you've mastered this, find two more people.",How to Improve Fighting Reflexes,";
,, While your partner executes the attack, attempt to dodge or block it. Be wise to understand that certain attacks can't be blocked, for instance, blocking a punch will just get yourself hit both by the punch and by the hand or arm you chose to block with. You can also train an immediate counter-attack after successfully dodging the original attack.

, If you think you're doing it right, then begin increasing the attack speed and the defense speed. Do this for about 10~15 minutes. Your body will learn to react to this particular situation.

, Continue training for about 10~15 minutes. Your body will now learn to react to a different situation. Nevertheless, until here, you're always expecting the attack.

,, Once again, begin slowly and keep increasing the attack speed if you're being successful in your training. Your body will now start to train on how to quickly identify the attack and respond accordingly.

, Repeating is the only way your reflexes will be trained.

, You want to improve fighting reflexes, not improve your reflexes when someone you know punches you in a very particular way.

, Have one stand on each side of and in front of you, and execute the same attacks at random (It is best to have another person call out a certain number for each person, to avoid all of them attacking you at once.)

Choose a ball.,
Choose a hole configuration.,
Measure your span.,
Record your measurements.,
Decide on an angle.,
Clamp the ball in place.,
Mark the ball.,
Select your bits.,
Insert the first bit.,
Drill your thumb hole.,
Switch bits and drill the finger holes.,
Sand the holes.",How to Drill a Bowling Ball," Choose the bowling ball that's right for you, based its weight and the materials it is made of.


Bowling balls can be made of plastic (the cheapest balls), urethane, reactive resin, or particle. Each of these different materials provides differing degrees of friction, power, and control.If you can, it's a good idea to experiment with different types and weights of balls before selecting one. Once you drill a ball, it's yours for good.;
, Different finger hole configurations will provide differing amounts of control and power. Choosing the configuration that's right for you will require you to assess your own strengths and weaknesses as a bowler.A conventional grip is achieved by drilling holes deep enough so that your fingers and thumb are inserted into the ball up to the second knuckle joint. This is the traditional bowling alley ball configuration because it is the easiest to control. It is the recommended configuration for beginners and players of moderate skill.
A fingertip grip is achieved by drilling holes that allow your fingers to be inserted into the ball up to the first knuckle joint. This is an advanced configuration that is much harder to control, but provides increased lift, power, and spin.A semi-fingertip grip is achieved by drilling holes that allow your fingers to be inserted into the ball between the first and second knuckle joint. This is a happy medium between the grips described above and is easier to master than the fingertip grip while providing more power than the conventional grip.There are also other types of grips, such as the Sarge Easter grip, but the three above are the most common.

, Measure the distance from the base of your thumb to the points at which the two fingers you will use to hold the ball will bend (some people prefer the forefinger and middle finger while others prefer the middle finger and ring finger).For a conventional grip, this means measuring from the base of the the thumb to the second crease in the appropriate fingers.For a fingertip grip, measure to the crease closest to your fingertip.
Using an adjustable bowling ball makes this process much more precise and is strongly recommended. Adjustable bowling balls have movable holes and various depths of finger inserts. A bowling ball manufacturer, sports and recreation store, or possibly your local bowling alley probably have a measuring ball.
If you do not have access to an adjustable bowling ball for measuring your grip, you can simply place your fingers onto the surface of your un-drilled ball and mark around each finger once the placement feels comfortable. This isn't as exact, but it is comparable.
Alternatively, you can also measure your span using a compass or calipers, keeping your fingers together and thumb out, and then reducing your measurement by about 1/8 of an inch (or 1/4 for a fingertip grip).To determine the depth the holes will need to be without a measuring ball, measure the distance from the edge of your span to the ends of the fingers that will be going into the holes.

, Write down both your finger depth measurements and the distance between holes for reference when drilling.

, Having an angle that fits your hand is crucial for comfort and performance. For example, if the holes are angled forward, the ball will have more lift when released because your fingers will remain inside until the last minute.


This is a decision you'll have to make based on what's comfortable for you, as well as your individual strengths and weaknesses as a bowler.

, Place the ball into a tight clamp to ensure that it does not move during drilling.


If the ball moves during drilling, the holes may come out uneven, making the ball uncomfortable to use or difficult to control.

, With an erasable marker or piece of chalk, mark the hole configuration, placing a mark at the center of the spot you plan to drill each hole. Use your span measurement to assure the holes will be properly placed.


When bowling balls are molded, they are suspended by a small rod that, when removed, leaves a hole that must be filled in. This is called the ""pin."" You should avoid drilling through the pin, as this may void your warranty and negatively affect the ball's performance. Make sure your nearest hole is at least an inch away from the pin.
The pin should be easy to locate. It is usually a different color than the rest of the ball.
For advanced ball drillers, the pin is used to determine properties of the bowling ball's core that can be used to determine the ideal location on the ball to drill finger holes, depending on the qualities you want the ball to have.This will vary from one model of ball to the next, so if you want to try this, you should consult the instructions that came with your ball.
It's a good idea to double check your marks against your span measurements before drilling. Once the holes are drilled, they are permanent.

, Determine the correctly sized drill bits to create comfortable holes for your thumb and fingers.


You can determine this easily if you used a sizing ball to get your hand measurements, as these balls also provide information on your thumb and finger widths. If you did not have the benefit of a sizing ball, a good way to determine this is to experiment with different bits, drilling holes of different sizes into a block of wood and then determining which ones most comfortably fits your thumb and fingers., Prepare your bowling ball drill with the proper bit for your thumb width.


It is strongly recommended that you use a bowling ball drill. Attempting this with an ordinary drill may damage your ball.

, Drill the hole slowly at your desired angle, checking the depth often so as not to drill too deep.

, Swap out the drill bit and drill the two finger holes. As with the thumb hole, check the depths often to avoid drilling too deep.

, Replace the drill bit with a sanding attachment and sand the interior of the holes until they are smooth and our fingers slide in and out easily and comfortably.

Learn the principle of a counter-attack.,
Decide whether you should study Djem-So or Shien.",How to Learn the Basics of Form V1," Form V is all about redirecting your opponents attacks back at them, and attacking immediately after defending.
, Shien is more useful for fighting blaster-wielding opponents such as droids or bounty hunters. Djem-So focuses more on using physical strength to dominate a lightsaber duel. Bear in mind that some Jedi frown upon Djem-So as being not in keeping with the Jedi code."
"
Know the difference between Shien and Soresu.,
Try using a reversed grip when using Shien.",How to Learn the Basics of Form V2," Shien is very similar to Soresu, in that it uses similar moves to deflect blaster bolts. The main difference with Shien, though, is that the blaster bolts are deflected in such a way that they either:

Return to, and hit, the person who fired them;
Hit another opponent; or
Damage the environment in such a way that is disadvantageous to your opponent (e.g. destroy an overhang and bury them under a pile of rubble)

, This makes it easier to perform large, sweeping moves, in the manner of throwing a punch. Some, however, frown on this style. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide."
"
Use counter-attacks to disrupt the enemy.,
Once you're on the offensive, use strong, powerful, brute-force attacks to batter down your opponent.,
Use an attack called the Falling Avalanche.,Use Soresu techniques to help defend yourself until you can get in a counter-attack.",How to Learn the Basics of Form V3," If you're on the defensive, counter-attack your opponent after they make an attack. This should help to put you on the offensive. Then, use repeated power attacks to keep your opponent on the defensive and batter them down., Djem-So is all about dominating the duel using (Force-enhanched) strength. For this reason, some of the more pacifist Jedi frown upon it., This attack is special to Djem So. The handle is held behind the head withe blade pointing downwards or backwards. The lightsaber is then swung up and over the head, and down onto the opponent, with as much force as you can muster. This attack is very useful for breaking an opponents defense.,"
"
Shien: the blade is held above the head, angled upwards and backwards.,
Djem So: the blade is held above the head, angled backwards and down at about 45 degrees.",How to Learn the Basics of Form V4," The dominant foot is held back., This is also the beginning stance for the Falling Avalanche attack."
"
First, counterattacking doesn't necessarily work for those who are the strongest and fastest.,
Now, the first step is to be calm.,
Wait for the attacker to make a move.",How to Counterattack1," If you do everything correctly, it should work out fine.

, If you aren't calm, and you're panicky, countering is much less likely to succeed.

, If he attempts a tackle, just dodge it by moving to either side as fast as possible.

"
"
If he goes for a move with his arms or hands, such as a punch, intercept the blow as soon as you can.,
If he tries to kick you, block the attack first.,
If he attempts a grapple, you can dodge, or you can let him get you.,
Still, even if you're fighting a complete noob, you have to be careful.,
Place an open palm, with your fingers together, on the outside elbow joint.",How to Counterattack2," Next, as quickly as you can, twist his arm and attempt to bring it behind him. When you're done, you should have a hand firmly on his arm, with it pressed against his back. This places you behind him and is rather painful. If he is quick or strong, throw your arm around his neck and put him in a headlock of sorts, further stabilizing yourself. The next move is up to you.;
, This will probably stagger him and make the counter easier. Grab his leg and rip as hard as you can in any direction, but going towards you can work well. If he falls, try to bring his leg up and close to his back as fast as possible. Sit on him if you have to, but keep his leg held. If he reverses the counterattack, get out of there and recover. If he starts a leg choke, you're done for, unless you're lucky. Or very fast and strong.

, The second option can be better, in some cases. Keep in mind that untrained grapples are much, much easier to counter than someone who's trained in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for half of his life.

, First, break his grip. This can be done many ways, but simple grabbing his arm and tearing it away can work. If it doesn't, strike the inside of his arm, and aim for the elbow joint. If you hit him hard enough, not only will it hurt like hell for him, but he'll probably let go. In the split second of confusion is when you make your counter. Snatch his arm and do something similar to a punch counterattack, or you can try a new move.

, Then, grab his wrist. The backs of your hands should be facing you. Then, with one foot planted solidly, put your other leg in front of him like you're going to trip him. Because you will. Now throw him from the arm you have seized, and he should fall quite naturally. From here, you have him on his stomach, with his arm pulled out and back. He is pretty helpless. You can hold him there even better by putting the foot you tripped him with on his back. From here, you can inflict pain by pressing on his joint. Be careful, though. You can easily break his arm unintentionally, or intentionally.

"
"
For punches, strike his forearm as he is about to hit you, defend the other side of your head with your arm, and then follow through with a punch of your own.,
Take whatever he gives you.,
If you catch his leg, pull him towards you, and you should be on top.,
If you fail to catch his leg several times, go to plan B.,
If he attempts a grapple, there is one simple move you can do.",How to Counterattack3," With the arm you just deflected with, give him a hook to the cheek. Your arm should already be in a position where it will seem more like a haymaker. Then you can back away and wait for him to attack again, or you can go in and continue pummeling him.

, If he kicks, grab his leg and knock him off balance. If he punches or grabs you, hold his hand to your body. He will become distracted with losing his hand and will be open to punching or kicking.

, From there you can punch his stomach or face.

, Wait until the kick hits, and then charge him, tackling him. He should fall down rather easily. From there, you can beat on him from above.

, Put your hands on his shoulders, push down, and knee him on the nose while he's going down. This move is crippling, and if you do several in a row, he will probably be done. If you can't knee him in the nose then just fall on top of his body and pin him down. This will stop his body from moving unless he is strong enough to pull back from your fall.

Get in a standard pushup position.,
Place your weight on the first two knuckles of each hand.,
Perform the pushup by lowering your body, then pushing it back up.,
Use your thumbs if you need stability.",How to Condition Your Knuckles1," Make sure your back is straight and your feet are shoulder length apart.Complete knuckle pushups on a soft surface like carpet, a workout mat, or even grass. Over time, once these surfaces feel comfortable and are not challenging anymore, you can do knuckle pushups on a hard floor or concrete.;
, While still in the pushup position, make a fist with each hand one at a time, placing each fist on the floor. You will use your fists to hold up your body instead of your palms. Focus on placing your body weight mostly on the first two knuckles.


You can also do fingertip pushups if knuckle pushups are easy for you.If you can do both knuckle and fingertip pushups, alternate between the two.

, Lower your body until it almost touches the ground and push your body back up, using your knuckles to hold your weight the entire time. This may hurt at first and will irritate your knuckles, so only do 80% of the pushups you would normally do, and complete these on a soft surface.









For example, if you usually do 100 pushups, only do 80, and if you do 80 pushups normally, only do 64.
Increase the amount of knuckle pushups with each work out.
If your knuckles are excessively sore, do not complete more knuckle pushups until they heal, up to 2 weeks.

, Place your thumbs on the ground to help stabilize your body if you are falling over or feel very wobbly.

Wrap your hands.,
Punch the bag without gloves.,
Repeat as part of your normal workout to see results.",How to Condition Your Knuckles2," Use heavy-duty cotton wrist wraps to wrap your hands and prevent injury. Wraps will come with a loop that is placed around your thumb. Secure this loop around your thumb, then start wrapping the cloth around your wrist. Continue to wrap, moving the cloth upward until your entire hand and fingers are covered in 2-3 layers of secured cloth. Then, finish with one last wrap around your wrist.


Secure the wrap with Velcro or by tucking the end of the wrap underneath the cloth on your wrist.
Wrap both hands.
Never use a punching bag without first wrapping your hands, even if you want to condition your knuckles.

, This increases the pressure on your hand bones and will allow your knuckles to become stronger. Remember to start off with only a few minutes of punching per day, then increase the time you punch the bag by a few minutes each week.

, Give your knuckles a break if they feel sore, and do not punch the bag without gloves until your knuckles are not sore to the touch anymore, which may take up to 2 weeks.

Grab the rice with your hands and twist your knuckles into it.,
Punch your knuckles into the rice.,
Dig your thumbs deeply into the rice.,
Squeeze the rice as hard as possible, then release.",How to Condition Your Knuckles3," The bucket should be wider than your fist and deep enough to contain at least five inches of rice.

, Use a lot of force as you grip handfuls of rice, then release the rice back into the bucket. In addition, push your knuckles into the rice, and twist your hand to add additional pressure.

, Stop when you feel sore or if your skin breaks. Complete this exercise for a few minutes as part of your usual workout regimen, and use other knuckle conditioning methods in addition to punching rice for best results.


Some martial artists replace rice with harder, more coarse material, but now, this is considered unsafe.
Use rice unless you are training under the supervision of a professional trainer who recommends other materials.

, Repeat this for every finger. Remember, the more contact your hands make with the rice and the more pressure you put on your hands, the better your results will be. Take a break if you are experiencing excruciating pain or begin to bleed.

, Grab handfuls of the rice and squeeze. This will strengthen not only your knuckles, but your entire hand. Repeat the rice exercises as part of your regular workout.

, You can use a tennis ball as well. Squeeze the ball tightly in your hand for 90 seconds, then let it go. Repeat this exercise three times per hand.

, Lay two pieces of newspaper on top of each other, then fold them in half. Tear the paper with both hands until the paper is in tiny pieces, and repeat this exercise until you have ripped up all of the newspaper.

, Grip a resistance band with one hand, your fingers and your palm facing up. The other end of the resistance band will go underneath your feet. You should be standing with your elbow at your side and bent to 90 degrees. Use the other hand to grip right below your wrist as you curl your wrist and fingers up against the resistance band.

Learn.,
Train.,
Practice and work hard on your strategies.,
Train like a warrior.,
Never ever give up.Giving up is not the way of a warrior.,
Live your life as a warrior from the crack of dawn to midnight.",How to Become a Warrior," You have to learn about a lot of different subjects and skills to do this. Here are some of them:


Combat: You should know either a basic martial art or a way to defend yourself. Consider taking a self-defense class. A warrior always knows hand-to-hand combat. Try thinking about taking a Krav Maga Class. Krav Maga is an Israeli Martial Art that incorporates tons of stuff in. You can learn more by doing a search on Google or Yahoo.
Disguise: Sure, warriors charge all the time, but sometimes, warriors also know stealth & disguise. We will talk about stealth later. For basic camouflage, try to blend in either with the crowd or with the environment. Wear what everybody else is wearing.
Stealth: Learn how to walk silently by having a friend help you. Have him stand in the middle of the room with his eyes closed as you try to sneak by him. As soon as you become proficient at this, try to sneak up on animals that have more sensitive hearing.;
, You have to be physically fit and healthy at the same time. To get that impression of a warrior, weight-lift. A lot. Also be sure to run at least 3–5 miles (4.8–8.0 km) a day. You never know when you'll have to chase somebody through a crowded city street. And on that note try to learn basic parkour, and always remember to start out slow and work your way up.

, If you want to be a warrior you'll have practice hard and plan on improving your strategies. Learn new techniques to develop your combating skills.

, Look at workouts online and a 7 minute workout app is brill. Press-ups and sit ups will do though, You'll have to last till the end even if you are not strong. You should concentrate only on your training and thus only can you improve.

, Eat a Warrior Breakfast including, eggs, ham, vegetables, milk or orange juice, and any other healthy stuff you can find around your kitchen. For lunch, eat some grilled meat or a deli sandwich with some potatoes and an apple or banana for desert. The key here is to eat healthy.

Instead, utilize these sessions as what they are: practice. Begin sparring at a pace and volume that suits your abilities at the current moment, rather than launching into an all-out bout right from the get-go.As an upcoming match draws near, increase the intensity to match-level during the week leading up to it to prepare yourself for an actual fight. Allow a day or two of rest immediately before the match to recuperate and avoid injury. Slow things down again once the match has passed so you can continue to work on new techniques or improve on those that need more work.;
, Team up with people who are willing to stick to a given pace and volume. Avoid those who may escalate the intensity of your sparring out of boredom, disrespect, or competitiveness. Before you begin each session, have a conversation with your partner about how “hard” you wish to spar, and then agree to stick to that level of intensity.Things to consider when discussing the parameters of your sparring include the length of each round, where and where not to hit, and the acceptable force of impact.
Ideally, find a partner who is either on the same level as you or better. A partner with equal abilities will allow the two of you to grow together, while a more experienced partner will most likely have better control over their level of intensity.

, Once the two of you start sparring, be on the lookout for the first steps of escalation. Even when you have a well-meaning partner, one quicker or more powerful strike than agreed upon can easily lead to an even quicker or more powerful strike from the other, and from there the intensity will only continue to mount.If you find the pace and volume growing beyond what was discussed beforehand (or slackening off), speak up. Rein the both of you back to the agreed-upon level of hardship.Expect a sparring partner with more experience than you to possibly overestimate your abilities and/or regress into their own performance level without realizing it.
Expect a partner with less experience to have a more difficult time resisting the urge to give it their all.

, There are far too many different types of strikes and combos to use effectively all at once right from the start. Ease up on your expectations of yourself. Take baby steps. Before you spar, determine which techniques you need to work on the most. Choose one or two to focus on in any given session. Learn how to do each one well before broadening your scope and incorporating other techniques.Punches: cross; hook; jab; uppercut.Kicks: front; hook; round; side; spinning back.Combos: 1) front kick + cross + hook; 2) left jab + left side kick + right cross + round kick; 3) double left jab + cross + hook + round kick., Treat your sparring partner as a teammate, not an opponent. Use them as a source for pointers on how to improve your techniques. After each session (especially if they managed to dominate you throughout or delivered any surprises that took you off your feet), ask them what openings they saw that allowed them to score points on you. Utilize their eyes to spot any weaknesses or habits that you may have shown so you can work at hiding them from future opponents.Remember: teamsmanship is a two-way street, so reciprocate. Be honest with your feedback when your partner asks about their own performance, and volunteer advice when you catch them making mistakes that they may not be aware of, in order to ensure that they will do the same for you.

, Spar with a variety of people who range in size, body-type, speed, etc. Go up against tall fighters, short fighters, scrawny ones, bulky ones, those who are lightning fast and those who rely less on speed and more on brute force. Seek out right-handed and left-handed fighters to learn how to adapt your own stance and techniques to both situations. Develop strategies to counter each opponent's strengths and take advantage of their weaknesses.For example, say you are very quick on your feet, while your partner is much larger, but slower. Use your speed to get in and out of striking range as quickly possible, with just enough time for you strike, but not enough for them to do the same. Now, let's say the opposite: your opponent is much quicker to you. Back them into corners so they have no room to retreat.

, Wear three- to five-pound wrist- and ankle-weights during sparring sessions, as well as during other training. Grow accustomed to having to work harder to accomplish strikes, blocks, and footwork effectively. Develop the necessary speed and power with this extra weight in order to increase your endurance during live matches, when your hands and feet will be that much lighter without the weights.This will also make it easier for you to keep your hands up to block strikes despite growing tired over the course of particularly long or brutal matches.
Be aware that consistent use of ankle and leg joints have been linked to injuries due to the extra strain they place on your joints. Such injuries are not universal among all users, but play it safe anyway. Avoid using them all the time and discontinue immediately if you begin to feel pain in nearby joints, tendons, and ligaments., Take time out from sparring to practice your offense. Ask a partner to hold up pads for you to punch and kick. Use this opportunity to perfect your strikes without having to worry about being struck in return. Focus on delivering your strikes with optimum force and minimal effort so that doing so comes more naturally to you in the midst of a match.

"
"
Keep your head mobile.,
Volunteer to hold pads.,
Grow accustomed to being struck.,
Keep your eyes open.",How to Become a Better Kickboxer2," Hold your hands up to block strikes as instructed, but do not rely on this alone to keep your head protected in a match. In addition to raising your hands and arms for cover, make your head a moving target so that your opponent’s strikes are less likely to connect. Stand in front of a mirror. Imagine that you have a marker fixed to the top of your head. Now practice moving your head as though you were writing a specific letter of the alphabet on the ceiling, over and over again.Stick to letters that are simple in design, like T, V, C, S, and L. Be sure to practice their mirror image, as well.
Don’t bother with more intricately designed letters like A, B, and R, or any other letter that continues to feel awkward in practice, since these head movements have little practicality in a match.
Once each movement feels natural after practicing them alone in front of a mirror, incorporate them one by one into sparring sessions to learn which works best as an evasive maneuver against certain strikes.

, When you pair off with a partner to practice strikes, don’t cheat yourself by placing too much emphasis on your turn as striker. Use the role as strike to improve your defense. Since you don’t have to worry about getting hit anywhere other than your pads, seize this opportunity to strengthen skills beyond the offense:Take the time to analyze your partner’s stances and techniques. Develop your skill at identifying their weaknesses and habits in the moment, so that you will be quicker to recognize the same weaknesses in other opponents during live matches.
Since you have fewer things to do with your hands, use this opportunity to concentrate your footwork. Learn how to dictate the fight with your feet alone. Focus on how you can alternate your speed, footing, and direction to disrupt your partner’s tempo and back them up in directions they don’t want to go.

, Getting hit can literally be a blow both physically and mentally. Face the reality that this will happen. Don’t define “the perfect fighter” as someone who never gets hit.Instead, aim to be the perfect fighter who bounces back from blows instantly. Embrace every strike that sneaks by your defenses in training as an opportunity to grow that much more acquainted with the sensation of being struck.


When it is your turn to hold pads when practicing strikes with a partner, focus on your blocks and shields to further normalize the feel of receiving blows so that they are less of a distraction in live matches.Use medicine balls to acquaint your core with being struck. Ask a partner to stand beside you while you lay on the floor and do crunches, sit-ups, ab pikes, or similar exercises in which your back is on the ground in between each rep. Before you begin, agree to the amount of force your partner will use. Then, in between each rep, when your back is flat on the ground, let them drop or even hurl the medicine ball straight at your abs.

, The closer your opponent is to you, the more likely either one of you can deliver a strike in the blink of an eye. So don’t blink! Avoid missing an incoming strike or an opening on their part that you can take advantage of. Keep your eyes peeled as long as possible when you are in close, and blink rapidly to make up for it when you are spread well apart from each other.Keeping your eyes open for as long as you can is a technique that you can easily practice both in and out of the ring.

Jog.Build physical endurance that will carry over to matches within the ring.,
Run sprints.Once you are able to jog for a fair amount of distance, work on increasing your speed.,
Charge hills.After warming up with a brief jog, run intervals up the slope of a low, steep incline, or, if all of the hills in your area are all incredibly high, mark a finish line along the slope that you can reach in about eight to twelve seconds.,
Jump-rope.,
Do box steps.,
Practice backing up.",How to Become a Better Kickboxer3," At the same time, grow accustomed to having to move your feet a lot during matches. To avoid overexerting yourself and risking injury, start off with daily jogs at both a pace and a duration that you can manage easily, so that you are able to converse with a partner without becoming too winded.If needed, alternate between jogging and walking in the beginning if your endurance is low at first. Set off at a jogging pace for one minute, then fall back to walking for four minutes. Repeat three times for a total of 20 minutes. As this grows more comfortable, increase the time spent jogging and reduce that spent walking period by one minute each from run to run until you are able to comfortably jog for 20 minutes without stopping. From there, add additional increments of five or ten minutes to your runs as they become more manageable., Improve your ability to burst into motion at maximum speed so you can move around the ring quickly. Hit the track and run reps on the 100-meter straightaway.


Again, start small in order to avoid overexerting and hurting yourself.Keep to only a handful of reps at first. Start off with a less-than-full sprint that you can maintain from start to finish of each rep, so that your last rep matches the same speed as your first. As each workout becomes easier, increase your speed to a full sprint. Then add a rep or two to each workout.
Be sure to go for a short jog first to warm your legs up and reduce the chance of injury.

, Sprint up the hill with short strides. Walk or jog back down, and then repeat. Develop the ability to spring off your toes with this workout, which maximizes the most amount of muscles in your legs.As with all interval training, take baby steps at first to familiarize yourself with the physical demands of this workout. Ease off the pace in the beginning. Aim to run a consistent speed in each rep throughout the workout. Once you can manage to run that pace from start to finish, increase your speed with the next workout.

, Exercise your feet and legs with a variety of jump-rope workouts. Jump with both feet for three minutes at a slow pace until this becomes nearly effortless. Then alternate between fast and slow with 30-second intervals of each speed, for a total of three minutes.In other rounds, stick to jumping on just one foot for a total of ten steps, then switch to the other, until your three minutes are up. Avoid sticking to just one pace or style from workout to workout, so you can better adapt to quick changes in your opponent’s speed in the ring.

, Find a step, sturdy box, or other elevated surface that will support your weight. Use one that is about a foot high, or roughly shin-level when you stand next to it. Do step workouts at sprint-speed. Do “one” steps (returning each foot to ground-level before stepping up with the other foot), “double” steps (bringing one foot up, then the other, before returning each to ground level), or a combination of the two, to increase speed and force.Consistency is key, so start off with moderate intervals of 30 seconds each until you are able to perform each at an even speed with no missteps. Then gradually increase your reps by 10 or 15 seconds in future workouts.

, Set up a minimum of four traffic cones (or other suitable obstacles) in a straight line. Place them evenly, with enough room between each for you to weave between them. Stand at the head of the line with your back to the cones. Then, keeping your heels off the ground, jog backwards and weave around each cone. At the end of the line, about-face by pivoting on the ball of one foot, and then repeat. Increase your confidence in retreating from your opponents without tripping over your own feet or having to look behind you.Whatever objects you choose in lieu of traffic cones, make sure they are relatively soft or otherwise unlikely to cause injury should you make a few missteps in the beginning.

Practice frequently.",How to Ice Skate," When ice skating, wear clothes that are easy to move around in and will not get heavy when wet. Skating is exercise, so your body will get warmer once you move around, preventing you from getting cold on the ice. Go for a fitted top with leotards, tights, or leggings.If you're skating in an outdoor rink, wear similar attire. However, you may want to choose slightly thicker fabrics or add laters. For example, wear a light tank top over a form fitted sweater.;
, As you won't be moving around as vigorously during beginner moves, go for a light jacket or coat. This should be an outfit easy to take on and off, in case you get sweaty, and light and moveable enough that it does not get in the way of your motions on the ice.For example, a fitted sweater is a great choice for an ice skating outfit.

, Skates should be fitted for comfort and are available in most shoe sizes. When you first start ice skating, you can rent ice skates. This allows you to explore different brands and sizes to figure out what works for you. Go to a pro shop and get a fitted there., To keep your feet warm, wear ether skating tights or microfiber socks. It's important your feet are exposed to as little moisture as possible to keep you warm. Use either tights or microfiber cloths when skating.Never use cotton socks. These socks do not soak up moisture well and will leave your feet cold.

, For your safety, wear a helmet. This will prevent injuries to your head if you fall on the ice.

, Falling is part of the sport so it's natural that this will happen. Falling with the right technique will keep you from getting injured. The first thing you should do is practice falling. To fall properly, do the following when you feel yourself losing your balance:If you anticipate needing to fall, bend your knees and squat into a dip position.
Fall sideways, leaning forward, and place your hands on your lap. As soon as you fall, roll over onto your hands and knees.
One at a time, place your feet between your hands. Then, gently push yourself back up.

, Once you're comfortable skating around the rink doing swizzles, gliding, and stroking, you need to know how to stop. Stand together with your feet together. Push your feet apart while skating and stick one skate out sideways. This will push some frost off of the ice and cause your body to come to a stop. The motion is similar to skiing., Gliding is a form of marching on the ice that will help you transition into skating. March forward two steps and let your body glide forward slightly. Do this until you feel comfortable with it. Then, begin picking up one foot as you glide.In figure skating, you alternate between lifting one foot and another. Gliding helps you become comfortable with that feeling.

, Stroking is the same as gliding except you extend the motion longer. After marching, lift one foot as you glide, set that foot down, and lift the other. This is the foundation for basic skating. Repeat the process until you feel comfortable., After getting yourself gliding, place your heels together. Then, slide your feet apart. After this, point your toes together. Repeat this motion, leaving a trail in the ice that resembles an hourglass.Swizzles help you go through the general motions of skating but keep your feet on the ice.
Keep practicing swizzles until you feel completely comfortable with the move. Eventually, you can start lifting your skates off the ice in alternating patterns as you skate.

, You should do a quick warm up before skating. This will help prevent you from becoming sore while on the ice and, as your body may not be used to the cold. At first, cramps may be more frequent due to the weather. Simply stretch each leg over the barriers at the rink to warm up before skating., At first, you may be inclined to look down at your legs to make sure you're going through the right motions. This will not actually help you skate better and can actually cause accidents. Make sure to keep your head up so you do not collide with anyone on the ice., Always lean forward slightly when skating. Bend your knees and keep your weight forward. Leaning back can cause you to fall backward onto the ice., Ice skating is difficult and takes years of practice. While you may feel overwhelmed at first, practice a few times a week. You'll eventually get the hang of figure skating.


It's hard to judge your own technique as you cannot observe yourself. See if you can find professional lessons in your area in your price range. You can look online or look for flyers in your local rink."

Acquire your skates.,
Check the skates.,
Check that the blades are sharp before skating.,
Tie the boots tightly.,
Do not wear the boots for long periods initially.,
Try wearing the skates off the ice.,
Do workouts for your ankles.,
Most professional skate places have a machine that can heat the skates.,
Break the boots in on the ice too.,
If there is ever lots of pain, sit down and rest.",How to Break in Your Figure Skates," Before starting, you need to have purchased or have figure skates with you. If you've never worn skates before, it's recommended that you try skating in rental skates first, to see if skating is even what you want to keep doing. When you're happy that it is, then invest in your own pair of skates.


Consider getting the skates custom molded to your foot shape and size. You can go to your local skate shops and places where they sell and repair sports gear; ask them if they do skate molding.;
, Are they the correct size? If they're too large, they'll cause blisters; too small and you'll be in pain. Fit is extremely important; the shoe must fit well and it doesn't need to be expensive to achieve good fit.


The heel should fit firmly around the ankle. This area steers your foot around curves and turns.
The skate must be firmly around your foot. If you can fling your leg and you feel your foot move in the skate, it's too loose.

, If they're new, this shouldn't be a problem. If borrowed or hand-me-down, check that the blades are sharp.

, This is especially important at the ankle area.

, Lots of short bursts work best.

, Wear the skates around your house as much as possible. Wear while watching TV, listening to music, playing games or doing odd jobs around the house.


Don't forget to put on your skate guards and blade mounts, the ground will most likely damage the blades on your skates.

, For example, do knee bends, plies, etc., while wearing your figure skates.

, This heat helps expand the leather which makes the skate fit better to the form of your foot.

, On the ice, try to do more things that bend down and use your ankles a lot. This helps to get used to the feeling of skating in the new boosts.

,


The pain should be pretty minimal, if you start having cramps in your arch or a feeling of swelling, take off your skates and stretch your foot.
It might help to not tie your skates all the way up, leave the top two sections loose so your ankles can move around a bit more.

Think of why you want a private coach.,
Do some background checks on the coaches.,
Find out how much they charge.,
Watch the coach teach other students.,
Ask parents of other skaters that use that coach.,
Find out what the coach expects form her/his skaters.,
Lastly, make sure the personalities of the coach, parents and skater don't clash.",How to Choose a Private Figure Skating Coach," Do you want to compete? Do you want to just skate for recreational purposes? Heck, do you want to go to the Olympics? Share this info with some potential coaches and see which one is the most interested.

Some coaches won't teach you if you are not interested in competing. Figure out how extreme of a skater you want to be.
Also think about what type of figure skating you want to do. Ice dancing, freestyle, pairs, different coaches are needed for progressing in different areas.



 

;
, I'm not talking about some major background info, but find out enough to know at least a little about them. During an interview, ask some of these questions: How long have you been coaching? How long and where did you skate before you decided to coach? What major skating accomplishments have you achieved? What is your skating philosophy? How many students do you teach? Any references? Write this info down or make a mental note of it.

, Most coaches charge $25-$45 every 1/2 hour. An hour can range from $60-$75.

Figure out how much time you need with your teacher. If you are a beginner maybe only once a week for 1/2 an hour. More serious skating means more ice time.







, Observe the techniques he/she uses to teach and also watch the skaters.

Some coaches use strict, demanding techniques, while others try to be more relaxed and lighthearted in their lessons.







, Ask the skater(s) and their parents how the coach is. Find out how the coach behaves and teaches from these sources.

, Does she/he want them to go to the Olympics or just try their best? Does he expect them to come in every single day and not fall once or learn from the mistakes? Compare this to how you want your son or daughter to do and what you expect from them.

, Make sure that the three have the same goals, expectations, etc.

Make sure your kid really wants to skate. If the kid wants to do this just for fun and the coach is very strict about sticking with skating, it might not be a good match.

Compete.",How to Become a Figure Skater," Have you been playing ice hockey since kindergarten, or have you never set foot on a rink? Whatever your current skill level is, you can improve, so don’t put yourself down if you’re just starting. Just start now! Most professional figure skaters started lessons at age four, as soon as they were steady and verbal enough to understand instructions.Don't lose hope if you've already started school. Some Olympians have started at age nine (or later) and still achieved great success.If you’ve never skated before, group lessons are a fun, low-pressure way to learn. You can give ice skating a try this way and decide if it’s something you’d like to continue with.If you’re a little more experienced, try to make regular practice a part of your life before you move into private lessons. If you feel committed enough to go to the rink two or more times a week, that’s a great sign.;
, You'll need the right equipment, not just to look the part, but to perform as well as possible. Wear appropriate clothing to practice. Ice makes you cold and exercise makes you hot. You will feel a range of temperatures over the course of even one practice session, so naturally, it’s good to wear layers. Stretchy clothes are the best to practice in, so you can move freely.


When buying ice skates, shop around. Make sure you try models from several different companies until you find a pair that feels right.
If your skates are uncomfortable, wear extra socks for a while until you get used to them. Many skates will be uncomfortable for the first few sessions, but they will soon be broken in.
If your skates fit well but the breaking-in process is giving you blisters, you can wear bandages or moleskin patches over the spots that are troubling you.You also need blade guards, which keep your skates from getting damaged (or damaging other surfaces), and soakers, which help your blades stay free of rust.
Don't wear your skates around the house to break them in. The motions for walking and skating are not the same, so this will damage the skates.
Some stores sell special figure-skating tights, which should match your skintone. You don’t really need these until you start competing.
Don’t wear jeans or long skirts to practice! They can hamper your movement. In general, tight clothes are safer than baggy ones.If you have long hair, put it up. A bun is best, but a ponytail is also fine.You can also use a headband to keep bangs or flyaways out of your eyes.

, As you become familiar with the basics of skating through a group class or review, you will want to practice them alone. Your national or local figure skating association probably has a list of skills to master, arranged from easiest to most difficult.Here are some ideas to practice:


Stroke (a basic step, like a stride) forwards and backwards. Try switching directions until you can flow between the two smoothly.
Glide forward on one foot, then your other foot.You may find it easier to balance on one leg than the other--keep practicing until they're equally strong.
Start doing crossovers, in which you cross your feet over one another to gain speed.This is similar to a ""grapevine"" movement when you're walking, and will come in handy for coming into jumps as you advance.

, If you want to compete at a high level, you’ll need advice from someone who has been there already. Ask around your rink for recommendations, or look up coaches online. You really want to focus on finding someone who is experienced and works well with your style (including your personality.), Brainstorm when and how often you'd like to go to the rink. This will depend on many factors, including how often you have lessons, how often you can get to the rink, and what other commitments you have during the week. Shoot to practice at least twice a week.


Once you have an idea of how often you'd like to practice, check in with your parent, guardian, and/or whoever drives you to practice. You can work together with them to craft a good and workable plan.
If you and your parents or guardians need advice about how often to practice, ask your coach or teacher. Say something like ""I'm trying to improve to compete in a state competition--what should I be focusing on, and how often should I be practicing?""

, You will fall. Everyone does, even Olympic medalists, so you should get used to the idea now. Instead of getting upset, focus on getting up. Falling often means that you’re trying something new or taking a risk--both great things.


If you can tell you are going to fall, lean a bit forward, then drop to one knee. If you’ve done that, you can try to gently slow your fall with your hands.If you’re surprised by a fall, then just try to do it as softly as possible.

, Practicing your skating is important, but other types of training will give you more power and endurance. Even if you hate gym class, there are tons of other exercises that can help you.


Running will increase your lung capacity and strengthen your joints. If you run a lot, make sure that you stretch a lot, too.
Pilates and yoga empower your core and help your flexibility.If you get advice from a good trainer, weight training can power you up, too., These will increase your core’s power, and strengthen your lower body too. Best of all, you can do them with no equipment at home. Start in sneakers, socks, or barefoot. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart and your shoulders square, then follow these steps:


Lift one knee until it’s about the height of your hip.
Now bring back your foot and lower your upper body until you’re in an arabesque, or T-shaped position, with one leg planted and one leg raised behind you.
Bring your raised foot forward until you’re in the knee-lifted position again.Repeat 10 times, then switch to the other foot. You can do this exercise several times a day if you feel strong enough.

, This is a big, soft hemisphere with a hard plastic bottom. Because the top isn’t a stable surface, it’s a wonderful tool to perfect your balance. Professional athletes, including skaters, use balance balls in all kinds of ways.Try these!


Stand about two feet away from the balance ball. Lunge forward so that your front foot is on top of the ball. Stay here for a moment, then pull back and repeat. Be careful not to overextend your lunge--this is when your knee extends farther than your front foot.Repeat 8-12 times, then switch to the other side.
Start in a lunge position, then bring your back leg forward until your feet are next to each other. You might want to bring your fists back to your hips as you do this if it helps you balance. Kick the leg back again so you’re in the starting position, and repeat.

, Flexibility is as crucial as strength, so stretch before and after every workout, and whenever you have a few minutes to yourself. You can even stretch during TV commercials.Your gym teacher or coach probably has some favorite stretches, but here are some classics.


To stretch your hamstrings (the backs of your legs), sit on the ground with one leg extended. Bend the other leg so that its knee touches the ground, and its foot touches your other knee. Bend toward your extended foot.To stretch your quadriceps (the fronts of your legs), stand tall on one leg, then bend the other back so that you’re holding your foot. If you have trouble balancing, tighten your core.
To stretch your arms and shoulders, fold your hands behind your back. Then, flatten your hands so that your palms are facing the floor, and straighten your elbows., Just as you practice skating on a timetable, you should condition on one, as well. Try to condition twice a week or so. Make sure not to work out hard if you're too tired, and always do extra exercise after you skate, not before., Figure skaters are athletes, and all that running around over the ice can make you sweat. The cold may keep you from feeling thirsty, but you still have to stay hydrated.Try filling a 32-ounce water bottle with room-temperature water, so that you can stay hydrated without feeling shocked at an extreme temperature.

, If you’re getting stronger and better at the basics of skating, it’s time to figure out where you want your skating to take you. Get out a sheet of paper and ask yourself:


Do I want to compete? At what level?
Am I willing to give up other sports to do this?
What kind of commitment can I show this? What are my and my family’s limitations? (For instance, your sister may only be able to drive you to the rink once a week, or you may not be able to afford private lessons as often as you want.)

, Even if you’re getting coached by a wonderful professional, you still need to hone your own skills. Half an hour of practice for every fifteen minutes of coaching you receive is often recommended.Don’t get discouraged if you don’t see consistent improvement--plateaus happen. If you continue to practice, you should get better and better.


Remember to take a day off from exercise once a week. Your body needs time to rest.

, This will help you if you can’t make it to the rink. You can still work on the tricks that are giving you problems, and hopefully improve! Try setting up in the basement or garage, but make sure you ask permission first.


Gymnastics mats can help you practice jumps. (Don’t wear your skates, or you’ll tear them up.) If you can’t get those, just try to practice on a soft surface.Mark a spot on the floor with painter’s tape, and then practice spins and jumps using it as a starting point. When you’re done with your trick, look back and see if you traveled a lot.
Keep stretching.

, To get to major competition level, you will probably have to pass several skating tests. These will vary depending on your country, but professional coaching, lots of practice, good fitness, and flexibility are essential. Different competitions may have slightly different requirements, but they will all demand a lot out of you.Your coach and rink may be able to assist you in finding competitions. They should also be linked on your national or local figure skating association's website.You and your coach can work together to choreograph your first routine, which will show off your skills and push you to learn new ones.
Remember: If you do not pass on your first try, keep trying. No figure skater wins every time--what’s important is that you keep practicing and doing your best.

Seek out emotional support.",How to Become an Olympic Figure Skater," If you are serious about Olympic-level figure skating, you should start training as a child.Some Olympic-level skaters (such as Johnny Weir) started as late as their early teenage years, but this is rare.


Many figure skaters start around 5 years old. However, there are successful figure skaters who began in the 7-12 age range. If you're willing to work to catch up to your peers if you need to, then don't be discouraged by your age.;
, Find an ice skating rink in your area where you can practice figure skating regularly.


You will want to find a rink nearby. Elite skaters spend 3-5 hours on the ice, and about 2-3 hours off the ice, nearly every day.
If you are serious about becoming an Olympic - bound athlete you also need to consider the resources that each rink offers. Does the rink host any competitions or shows that could give you exposure? Do other higher-level skaters already train there? Sometimes a close by rink might not be able to let you reach your full potential.

, Firstly, find a coach and take lessons. Plan for 1-2 private lessons per day. It’s okay to start with group lessons, but find a coach who is available to teach you multiple times per day, such as before and after school.




Most Olympic skaters also have more than one coach. One for expression and the performance aspect and another for skills and jumping, depending on the level.


Find a choreographer. You will need someone who is familiar with all the rules of skating and what elements would be allowed, as well as what elements you are good at. A good program can win almost by itself and a good choreographer can insure this.
Find an off ice athletics pro/teacher as well. This person will be skilled in yoga and personal training and will be able to lead you in activities/drills to improve your on ice skating.
Find a manager. This person will help organize all the paperwork and other things needed to compete. This person will keep track of your schedule and when the next competitions are as well as deadlines for entry forms. They can also help organize press and other media if you become famous.

, There are singles competitions, pair skating, and ice dancing.


Ice dancing is based on precise steps and interpreting rhythm. If you have good edges, turns, and musical ability, this may be for you!
Ice dancing is now opening up as a solo competition as well but only pairs ice dancing is allowed in the Olympics.If you want to enter pair competitions, notify your head coach and set up tryouts for a partner.
If you know you want to skate pairs or ice dance find a partner as soon as you can. Unfortunately guys are rare in this sport which makes them very valuable but also puts a lot of pressure on a girl to find a partner. , Typically competitive figure skaters practice six days a week.To make it to the Olympics, you will have to practice a lot!


Plan with your coach for rest days, which are equally important., Once you're ready to compete beyond the level of basic skills, you should become a member of an official figure skating club.Find the official figure skating organization with qualifying competitions in your region and join!
Consider entering a relevant program. Camps and other programs are designed to assist developing and existing figure skaters with honing their craft., To be a skater in the Olympic Games, you must qualify for the Olympic team. You must place first, second or third in your country’s national championships to qualify.

There have been exceptions when the National Figure Skating Board of a country has decided to send a skater that did not make the podium, as the United States did when they sent Ashley Wagner(fourth place overall)over Mirai Nagasu (third place overall) to the 2015 Winter Olympic Games.


Start at a local level first and work your way up as you build upon your experience.

The order normally goes; district, regional, sectional, national.



, Warming up prevents injury, decreases muscle tension, and improves your range of motion.Warm up for 5-10 minutes, or until you break a sweat., Once you've committed yourself to a skating career, you'll need to make skating a huge part of your lifestyle.Figure skaters need to know how to jump, glide, spin, stop, and skip.
Work on balance, coordination, agility, flexibility, and speed.
Focus on daily athletic training both on and off the ice., Athletes burn many calories and need to supply their bodies with healthy fuel to burn lean muscles.Always stay hydrated and never skip breakfast.Make sure you're getting enough calcium, iron, and Vitamin D.Avoid excess salt or sugar.Try juicing fruits and vegetables, grilling meat and fish, steaming vegetables, and adding seeds to cereal. Regularly consume lean proteins, whole-grain carbs, and other foods that will boost your immunity., Understanding rhythm and choreography is part of figure skating professionally.Choose music that reflects your personality but also conforms to the musical selection rules of the event you're preparing for., Young skaters should get at least 10 hours of sleep at night.


Your body needs time to recover and refresh both physically and mentally., Besides classes on the ice, figure skaters are often active in other areas which improve choreography and conditioning, such as ballet or jazz lessons.


Yoga and core work can help you improve your balance.Pilates utilizes core work and balance techniques, as well as stretching., Ice skaters fall down frequently - it comes with the territory.A good coach can instruct you on how to manage falls.


Hard falls can cause injuries.Even minor injuries should be treated to lessen the chances of developing into more severe chronic problems., Not everyone can be an Olympic-level athlete, so be realistic. Have you shown particular talent in skating classes?


For example, stroking - gliding forward from one skate to the other.</ref>

, Does your family have the finances to support a career that could cost many thousands of dollars? It’s difficult to put a dollar amount on just how expensive becoming an Olympic figure skater can be.Here are some basic costs to consider.Private lessons
Skates and costumes
Rink cost for practice
Travel expenses for competitions and recitals

, A successful figure skater doesn’t try to process every movement and technique mentally, but instead relies on muscle memory and instinct., Professional figure skating requires intense training and competition.Even for a young child the training is a full time job., Are you okay with sacrificing your free time in order to pursue this dream?For example, your peers may be playing video games, going to the movies, or attending other social gatherings. Would you prefer to be socializing, or on the ice?

, Most skaters reach a plateau at some point, and there's nothing wrong with that.Have fun learning and realize that mastering a skill takes time.
Don't give up. Approach your coach about the issue, or try breaking from the rut by attending an ice skating seminar, for example., Have discussions with your family and ask how supportive they will be if you choose this path.

, Whether you make it to the Olympics or not - and whether you earn a medal or not - you will benefit from learning great life lessons such as strength.If you enjoy skating and fall short of that ultimate goal, congratulate yourself on the benchmarks you did achieve!

, Figure skating at the highest levels requires a huge amount of dedication at a very young age. You will need support from family, friends, coaches, and possibly a professional counselor.


Pay attention to your mental health and let your family know if you need more resources.
Everyone has periods when they aren't sure they want to continue - when that happens, go to your supporters and be honest with yourself. If you do wish to continue, push through the low period with training and exercise, but also make time for things you need to avoid burnout, such as time listening to your favorite music or a professional massage.

Look for skates that are specific to your child's needs.,
Take your child's age into account.,
Get professional advice.,
Get the right size.,
Buy skates that are comfortable.,
Pay attention to ankle stability.,
Choose quality skates.,
Look for affordable skates.,
Buy skates that allow for easy maintenance.,
Explain to your child that new skates must be broken in.",How to Buy Ice Skates1," Hockey skates won't work for figure skating, and figure skates won't work for playing hockey.


Figure skates have a longer blade and a toe pick on the front, while hockey skates have a curved blade and no pick.
Figure skates are more stable than hockey skates and are better for recreational skaters. If you are purchasing a first pair of recreational skates for your child, you're probably better off starting with figure skates.;
, Most of the guidelines for purchasing children's ice skates apply to children of all ages, but keep in mind that:


Toddlers need skates with a wide double rail (two blades) and a solid bottom. These skates will be safer and more comfortable for very young skaters, and they won't need to be broken in.
Children younger than six should also have a double rail to prevent wobbly ankles.

, There are a huge variety of children's ice skates on the market, and different types of skating call for different skates. In general, then, it's best to buy your child's skates from a dedicated skating store, where you can get the advice and assistance of a professional.


Avoid purchasing skates from a general department store. Without professional guidance, you may wind up with the wrong type of skates for your child, and this could lead to poor performance, an uncomfortable fit, or even an injury.
If your child has a coach or teacher, you can also use this person as a resource! He or she will have specific recommendations for your child and may also know where you can get the best deal on the skates you need.

, Correct fit is crucial -- if the skates are too small, they will hurt your child's feet, but if they are too large, they won't provide the necessary stability. Your child will likely need a different size in skates than he or she wears in sneakers, so again, a professional fitting is important.


Take your child to try the skates on, wearing thin socks (or whatever socks he or she will usually wear when skating). Try on several different brands, as each will have a slightly different fit. The skates should feel quite snug compared to regular shoes, but they should not be painful.
Lace up the skates completely when trying on. To get the best sense of the way a particular pair of skates will fit, you need to lace them all the way up.
Have your child stand and walk in the skates. If his or her heel lifts out of the boot, or if there is much wiggle room in the toes, the skates are too large.
You may be tempted to buy a larger size so that your growing child can wear them for a bit longer, but this isn't a good idea -- in fact, it could even lead to injury.
If you absolutely cannot try on skates in person and must estimate, start with a pair of skates two sizes smaller than your child's typical sneaker size.

, If you've found the right kind of skates in the correct size, you're already well on your way to choosing something your child will feel comfortable in. However, there are a few other things to keep in mind when you compare options:


Avoid buying double-bladed skates, or the kind that you strap onto your shoes. These skates don’t grip the ice properly. Your child may feel wobbly and uncomfortable in these skates, and he or she may wind up with a completely avoidable injury.

, Children’s skates should provide good ankle stability to prevent injury. This means that the skates need to have moderate stiffness, and your child should not be wobbly while standing in them.

, Although they are more expensive, higher quality skates will provide comfort and stability, leading to happy and injury-free skating sessions. In general, good figure skates will be made out of leather; while good hockey-style skates will be made out of strong but lightweight materials.


Different brands work best for different skates, but in general, Jackson and Riedell are seen as the best figure skate manufacturers. Bauer is a popular brand for hockey skates.

, Kids can outgrow skates very quickly. Since you can't buy skates a size too large without risking injury, you'll want to look for something affordable. It's probably not wise to buy the cheapest skates on the market, as these might not provide the support, comfort, or performance that you want, but there are a few ways to save money on your child's skates:


Consider a skate package. While boots (the shoe part) and blades can be bought separately, it is often easier and cheaper to purchase them as a package. This is especially true for kids, who may only be using their skates for one season before outgrowing them.
Look for skates allow for size adjustments. Some skates are built to be adjustable so that children can use them for a longer period of time.
Consider used skates. If you are struggling to afford a quality pair of skates for your child, you can try getting used ones from friends, relatives, or your children's teammates. However, fit and function are still crucial. If you can't find the right kind of skates in a good fit, it's not worth the savings.

, Skates that have the boots and blades attached allow for easy maintenance. Additionally, you will want blades that maintain their sharpness to reduce the maintenance required. Quality blades will reduce the need for constant sharpening.


Make sure you use blade guards and completely dry your skates every time you use them to maintain them.

, Brand new ice skates might feel slightly uncomfortable, even if they fit perfectly. Your child may wind up with a blister or two. Make sure your child understands that these issues should be temporary; once the skates have been worn a few times, they should feel nice and comfortable.


You can minimize this period of discomfort by having your child wear brand new skates for only thirty minutes at a time.

Keep your blades sharp.,
Understand that your skates will take some time to break in.",How to Buy Ice Skates2," Recreational skates are very different than those for figure skating or professional skaters. They are made to allow you to move forwards and backwards, do crossovers, and complete simple turns, but they won't work for competitive figure skating or professional-level hockey.

, In most cases, it's best to buy from someone trained to recommend the best skates for your needs. Do not purchase skates from a general department store because these skates will not give enough ankle support and can increase your odds of winding up with an injury.

, For most recreational skaters, skates that have the blade and boot (the shoe part) already connected work best. These skate packages are often cheaper, lower maintenance, and simpler to purchase.


Most recreational skates come with the blades already attached to the boots. Check with a professional at the skate shop to see what your options are.

, The best recreational figure skates should be made of leather, with steel blades attached only to the sole of the skate. Recreational hockey skates should be made at least partly from cloth and have a fiberglass frame.


Cheaper recreational skates will often be made out of plastic or synthetic leather. If you don't skate often and don't feel you need the highest quality skates, this may be an acceptable compromise for you.
Skates made out of vinyl will be very cold. They do not provide much stability, either, so it's best to avoid them.
The best hockey skates will have a gel layer inside that conforms to your feet when they warm up.

, Recreational skates start around $50 and can go up in price from there; some are as much as $1000. Most recreational skaters should budget somewhere between $50-$200, depending on the desired quality. Skates at the low end of the range will be of lower quality and comfort than those at the upper range.


If you buy boots and blades separately for figure skating, you'll spend more -- perhaps up to $600 for the boots and $600 for the blades.

, Fleece-lined skates have limited usefulness unless you are skating outdoors in very cold weather. Otherwise they do not provide much control over your feet and can be difficult to use.

, Start by trying on skates that are one size smaller than your normal shoe size -- skates are meant to be tighter on your feet than normal shoes.


It may be difficult to find special sizes in recreational skates but they can come in many sizes and different widths. Check with your skating store to see whether they carry skates in very small or very large sizes, and see which brands come in narrow or wide versions.

, Many recreational skates are quite soft for extra comfort but not good for intermediate figure skaters that will be doing turns and spins. Skates with a moderate stiffness will be best for providing good support while also being flexible enough for quick breaking in and good comfort.


If you are a beginner or just want to enjoy being on the ice with family and friends then you should choose a soft skate for comfort.
If you are an intermediate skater and beginning to learn freestyle skills but are not ready to be high-end figure skating skates then you should go with a more moderately stiff skate.

, Check the tongue of the boot for stiffness and padding. The tongue has a big effect on comfort and extra padding will protect your legs and feet from injury.

, Wear thin socks that are the same as those you will be skating in, and lace your skates properly. Skates should be laced loosely around the toe area, tightly over the bridge of your foot and beginning of your ankle and a bit looser around the top of the skate.


Thin socks give better control over the skate and should not make your feet cold if you choose good-quality skates.
Do not wrap long laces around your ankle; rather loop them around the hooks at the top of the skate.

, Walk around for at least five minutes to test the skate and see how it feels. Your heel should not be moving around at all. If it does move try to tighten the skate and if it still moves, then you should go down to the next size.


Walking wobbly or standing knock-kneed or pigeon-toed is a sign that you may need a smaller size skate.
If your skates are painful to walk in or if your feet fall asleep within five minutes of walking then you should try a half size bigger.
You should feel as solid walking in skates as you do in your normal shoes. When you bend your knees your skates should give slightly without your ankles rolling.

, Skates can come in different widths and they can be stretched to some degree. If your skate seems a little tight across the ball of your foot then you might be able to fix the problem with a spray or stretcher.

, Ice skate blades should have two edges with a slight hollow in between and should be smooth and without dents. They should also easily scratch the surface of your fingernail when you run it across. If you see any of these problems then you should have your skates sharpened.


Some stores will be able to sharpen the skates for you. Alternatively, most indoor rinks or skating supply stores will have a specialist who can sharpen your blades for you.

, Even if you choose skates that are sized perfectly, they may cause some discomfort or blistering the first few times you wear them.

Choose figure skates if you are an intermediate to advanced-level figure skater.,
Purchase skates through your coach or from a dedicated skating store.,
Determine your budget.,
Know that finding the right skates can take time.,
Choose the correct size.,
Buy your boots and blades separately.,
Select higher quality boots according to your level.,
Choose higher quality blades.,
Customize your skates as needed.,
Lace your skates properly every time you wear them.",How to Buy Ice Skates3," Figure skates provide specialized support and control for advanced skaters. This allows skaters to execute jumps, spins and difficult turns. These skates will be very different from those for recreational skaters.

, Figure skaters need professional advice in selecting skates, so don't shop from regular department stores. Having the right pair of skates is much too important to risk buying from anyone who isn't trained to help competitive skaters.

, High quality figure skating boots can cost $600, with the blades costing around the same. Speak to your local store or coach to determine the amount you will need to budget for your skates.


If your budget is tight, it may be better to purchase higher quality used skates as opposed to lower quality new skates. Make sure the used skates fit correctly, have sufficient support, and have blades that still have some “sharpening life” left. When in doubt, consult with your coach or another professional before buying.

, Figure skates can be quite expensive, so it is important to choose the correct ones for your size and ability. Don't assume that the first pair you try will work; you may need to try several different sizes in several different brands before you find something that works.

, There should be no extra room in the boot. Figure skates are meant to fit quite tightly to increase stability while skating. In fact, many figure skates can be heat molded to fit your feet exactly. Take advantage of this opportunity -- ""baking"" will mold the skates to your feet as perfectly as possible.


Measure both your feet when deciding on your shoe size in case one foot is bigger than the other.
Sizing differs between brands, so be aware that if you choose a new brand, you may also need to choose a new size.
Choose the correct width. Many figure skates come in narrow or wide sizes, so don't settle for a mediocre fit.

, While pre-assembled packages are fine for beginners and recreational skaters, it is better for intermediate and advanced skaters to choose their boots and blades separately. This allows you to customize your features according to your body and style.


Again, consulting a professional is crucial. Your coach or another professional can help make sure you get the right combination of boots and blades.

, Competitive boots are typically made of leather and come in different levels of support. Boots for those completing single jumps will be lightweight while those for doubles and triples will be stiffer to provide a better level of support and stability.


Stronger, heavier skaters should choose boots that offer additional support.

, Higher quality blades will be sharpened less often and have better flow on the ice. Blade quality will affect spin and jump quality so it is an important aspect of your skates. Blades are usually chosen based on the size and features of the toe pick.


Larger toe picks give more stability for jumps.
Smaller toe picks and shorter blades are better for dance and synchronized skating.
Parabolic blades are good for those having trouble with edge slips.
K-picks are for those who skid or slip or toe jumps.

, Advanced figure skaters may need to make minor adjustments to their skates for the perfect fit. If you find the right pair of skates, and they fit well in general but rub your feet uncomfortably in just one or two places, you can have them ""punched"" (pushed out a bit in particular spots).

, Properly secured laces are essential for providing stability and comfort while skating.


Make sure your foot is placed in the boot all the way and tighten up the laces in the first half of the boot. The laces in this section should be secure but not overly tight.
Lace the second half of the boot and pull hard over the top of the foot and where the ankle bends. This area is the most the important part of lacing figure skates.
Finish lacing the boots around the hooks without pulling the laces too hard. The laces should be secure but not overly tight.

Choose hockey skates if you are playing ice hockey.,
Get professional advice.,
Purchase the correct type of hockey skates.,
Determine your budget.,
Decide on the material for the boots of your skates.,
Choose either a one-piece or two-piece holder and runner.,
Choose the correct blade length.,
Choose the correct size.,
Choose comfortable skates.",How to Buy Ice Skates4," Ice hockey is a competitive sport that involves a lot of time in your skates. Different positions will require different kinds of skates, so it important to know what style of play you will be engaging in.

, Purchase skates from a dedicated skating store so that you can get the advice and assistance of someone who knows about hockey skates. Do not purchase skates from a general department store; these skates will not provide enough ankle support and may make you more prone to injuries.

, There's more than one kind of hockey skate on the market, and they are truly distinct, so it's important to buy the correct kind.


Goalie skates have a lower boot with a wider blade for more stability and ankle and foot protection.
Other kinds of hockey skates also differ according to certain features, including blade radius. Your individual needs will depend on what position you play.

, Hockey skates start at about $50 and go up from there, depending on the quality of the materials used to make the skates. If you play competitively, you may want to invest in a more expensive pair of skates.

, Most hockey skates are a mixture of leather and synthetic materials to optimize durability, performance and comfort. Different synthetic materials such as Kevlar or graphite will determine the quality of the skate and the cost. Talk to your coach or another professional about the best material for your needs.


You want hockey skates with the highest durability, comfort, ankle support, stiffness, padding and workmanship in the most lightweight skate possible.
Many hockey skates offer gel inside that can warm up and mold to your feet, providing the best comfort and fit., On hockey skates the holder is the plastic piece between the boot and runner and the runner is the blade. Most beginning-level hockey skates will have a one-piece holder and runner.


It is better to choose a one-piece holder and runner for a beginner hockey player because they are cheaper. If the blade or holder happens to break at some point it usually costs around the same to replace the entire skate.
Competitive hockey players will want to choose the two-piece design because if the runner breaks it can be easily replaced. The runner and/or holder may break when a high-speed shot is taken directly at the runner/holder.

, Hockey blades have a concave, or hollowed out, shape and are measured based on the amount of blade that is in contact with the ice, called the blade radius. To measure radius place the two blades together, bottom-to-bottom, and measure the distance between the points where the blades touch.

Beginners will want a blade radius of around 5 inches (12.5 cm) to give stability while moving forward and backwards.
To improve cutting and turning, choose a blade radius of 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm).
If you are a forward you will want a shorter blade radius to improve maneuverability.
Defensemen will want a longer blade for added stability.
Goalies will chose an even longer blade radius and have a less hollow grind to increase the contact with the ice., Choose hockey skate size differently from figure skates because they need to be tighter for more stability and less chafing. Try your hockey skates on with a thicker hockey sock, so that you know how they will fit when you are actually playing.

Different manufacturers make their hockey skates differently, so it is important to try on a range of brands.
Choose the correct width. Width is one of the most important factors in choosing the hockey skates that fit best. Most brands come in a range of widths including standard width (D or R), wide boots (E, EE or W), and sometimes even narrow width (C). If you have never had issues with sneaker sizes, then you will probably be fine with standard width skates.

, Hockey is a fast-paced game, and hockey players must feel like their skates are part of their feet. It is important to choose hockey skates that are comfortable and feel natural on your feet.

Understand that it may take some time to break your skates in. The first few times you wear a new pair of hockey skates, you might have some discomfort, or even develop a blister or two. If you've purchased good skates that fit correctly, however, this should be a temporary issue.

Competing Your Program

Most teams have 4-8 competitions a year.",How to Be a Synchronized Skater,"


In the US there are two different tracks of synchronized skating; ISI and USFS. The first is a more recreational league and the second is the more competitive track. The following information mainly only applies to USFS as it the most common league that a team will compete in.;
, Divisions are determined by age and Moves In The Field test level. There is a minimum test requirement for each division, but some coaches prefer if their skaters have passed a test that it higher than the minimum.The divisions are as followed;

Beginner 1, 2 or 3: A team of 8-16 skaters. No skater may have passed higher than preliminary in any discipline, and the majority of the team must be no test.
Preliminary: A team of 8-16 skaters. Skaters must be under 12, with the majority of the team under 10.
Pre-juvenile: A team of 8-16 skaters. The majority of the team must be under 12.
Juvenile: A team of 12-20 skaters. Skaters must be under 13 and have passed the preliminary moves in the field test.
Open Juvenile: A team of 8-16 skaters. All skaters must be under age 20. All skaters must have passed the pre-preliminary moves in the field test.
Intermediate: A team of 12-20 skaters. Skaters must be under 18 and have passed the juvenile moves in the field test.
Novice: A team of 12-20 skaters. Skaters must be under 16, with the exception of four skaters who may be 16 or 17, and have passed the juvenile moves in the field test.
Junior: A team of 12-16 skaters. Skaters must be at least 13 years old and under 19. All skaters must have passed the intermediate moves in the field test.
Senior: A team of 16 skaters. Skaters must be at least 15 years old and have passed the novice moves in the field test.
Collegiate: A team of 12-20 skaters. Skaters must be enrolled in a college or degree program as full-time students and have passed the juvenile moves in the field test.
Adult: A team or 12-20 skaters. All skaters must be 21 years or older, with the exception that up to four skaters may be 18, 19 or 20. All skaters must have passed at least one of the following tests: preliminary moves in the field, adult bronze moves in the field, preliminary figure or preliminary dance.
Masters: A team or 12-20 skaters. All skaters must be 25 years or older, with the majority of the team 30 years or older.







,,


Depending on the division, the length of a program varies from 2 minutes to 4:30 minutes. In the Junior and Senior division, teams will have 2 programs: a short program and a long program.
The coach picks the music/theme. Music chosen is often from movies, musicals, musical groups, or just a general style. Some themes that have been used are: Pirates of the Caribbean, Evita, a Spanish theme, Chicago, Harry Potter, etc.
The basic elements of a program are circles, blocks, lines, intersections, and wheels.
Skaters can be connected by a series of holds: hand hold, shoulder hold, elbows, wrists, teacup, and many more.
Some elements such as blocks can be 'unconnected' where skaters execute moves and patterns not holding on but still together.

,

Being on a synchronized skating team means that if you don't practice, it will be noticed easily and can affect the entire team.







,
The season officially runs from November-March. But most teams start practice in early summer to work on their programs.
Normally teams compete at a couple competitions and then go to a larger sectionals competition(Eastern Synchronized Skating Championships, Midwestern Synchronized Skating Championship and Pacific Coast Synchronized Skating Championships; which determines ranking and placing for higher competitions such as Nationals.
Depending on your division your team may or may not qualify for Nationals. If you do qualify, the Nationals are normally 2-3 weeks after the sectionals.
Junior and Senior level teams who win at Nationals may represent the USA in the Synchronized World and other international events.

Get a ball mark repair tool.,
Insert the tool.,
Move the tool along the ball mark.,
Tap the green.,
Repair other divots.,
Turn your shoulders when you swing.,
Transfer your weight to the other leg.,
Watch the ball.,
Wait to release the swing.",How to Use a Divot Tool," Ball mark repair tools (also called divot tools) usually have one or two pointy prongs and are made of plastic or metal. Buy a few from a sporting goods store or from the golf club. While you'll only need one, it's a good idea to have a few on hand if you lose one.If you don't have a ball mark repair tool, you can use a tee or a sharpened pencil.;
, You should see that the green behind the ball mark is slightly raised up. Insert the pointy end of the tool into this raised edge of the pitch mark. You should insert it at a 45 degree angle.








Don't insert the tool into the area of the green that's been pushed down by the ball. This could damage the green.

, While holding the tool into the ground, bring it forward toward the pitch mark. The goal is to fill in the indentation by restoring the green. Go around the sides of the pitch mark. The green should look level after you've used the tool.








Avoid pulling up on the tool, bringing the green to the top of the indentation. This will damage the roots and take longer to repair.

, Once you've filled out the divot using the tool, take your putter and lightly tap over the mark. Avoid pushing down hard since this could damage the green. The green should be even.








You can lightly step on the mark with your foot. But, if it's close to the hole, avoid stepping on it with your shoes since you could leave marks.

, While you should always repair your own divots, you can help other golfers and golf club maintenance by fixing any unrepaired ball marks left by other golfers.Many clubs recommend repairing two ball marks for each ball mark you make.

, If you have a steep swing and turn your entire body, you'll probably end up with a fat shot. Fat shots make contact with the ground before hitting the ball, creating divots. To prevent this, turn your shoulders while you swing instead of tilting them.Keep your body upright when you swing so your shoulders aren't pulled back., If you place most of your weight on your right leg when you take the swing, the imbalance can cause a fat shot and divot. Instead, shift your weight from your right to your left leg on the downswing.Don't simply put all your weight on the heels of your feet. Your weight should be balanced between the heels and balls of your foot.

, Watching the fairway instead of the ball can cause you to misjudge the distance between you and the ball. Keep your eye on the ball and make sure the ball isn't too close to the front of your foot which can cause fat shots.Make sure you're using the right club for the shot. It's better to take your time and gradually move it down the fairway, than try to drive it quickly using incorrect clubs.

, Releasing too early will make your wrist angle incorrectly so that you hit the ground before making contact with the ball. Keep your wrists in position and follow through with the swing before releasing.You should feel like your hands have swung beyond the ball before you actually feel your club hitting the ball.

,
Set up your event.",How to Run a Golf Tournament," Include a secondary date in case of rain the day of the event and you cannot play. Also, decide your final registration date to allow sufficient time to commit to suppliers of food, prizes, etc.;
, Make sure to sign a contract with the course so you know what to expect when it comes to fees and what the course will provide (advertising, beverages, and food).


The course manager can help you in your tournament planning and can tell you which holes will work best for specialty challenges. Specialty holes may include Closest to the Hole, Longest Drive, or Hole in One. Have a female and male winner for each and present prizes at ceremony.

, In the planner, you should include sections for participants, sponsors, food vending, prizes, and accounting. Think ahead regarding the tournament format, handicapping systems (to equalize players' abilities), the signup process, how the registration table and the invitations will look like and of course budget. Look online for detailed free event planners online that will help you stay organized.

, Custom trophies, t-shirts and promotional materials often require planning and ordering.

, Set the fee at an amount that will cover money to go toward the event and charges for using the course and food.

, Sponsors can be companies or individuals who donate money or items to your fundraising event. In return, the sponsor's name is advertised on a banner or marker at one of the golf holes.

, Include general fliers and registration forms. If you have an established presence on social media, it is a good idea to use such platforms as Facebook, Twitter or other niche social networks, to promote your golf tournament. If a charity is organizing the golf event, using Kickstarter is necessary.

, Information can also be sent via email if it is a corporate event.

, Typically, groups consist of four players. You may pair individual participants with other single players or groups who do not have enough players. Finalize your order for trophies, prizes, and memorabilia based on your final registration date numbers.

, Most golf tournaments conclude with a meal and ceremony. Any food provided between the 9th and 10th hole of play usually comes from the golf course.

, Make sure they are aware you will be using their logo so there are no copyright conflicts.

, Most tournaments have a Shotgun Start; this start has a team on each of the 18 holes and everyone begins at the same time.

, Auctions are great for fundraising events to increase the total amount of money collected. Purchase a large roll of raffle tickets that participants can buy individually for the auctions or a raffle. The raffle divides money from ticket sales with 50% going to the raffle winner and the rest toward the event.

,, Have a registration table for participants to sign in and purchase tickets. Also, have a table set up with auction items. Place a container next to silent auction items in which participants can put their tickets. Draw tickets to determine winners at the ceremony.

Backspin is possible in longer grass, though it'll likely be easiest for you to practice first on close cropped, well groomed grass.;
, Most regular golf balls comes in two types: soft and hard core. A soft core will make it easier for you to backspin your ball than one that has a hard core. For this reason, you may want to begin practicing backspin with soft core balls.


Hard-core balls are used to get more distance in a shot and frequently have a compression rating of 10. Soft-core balls allow for more control, and for backspin purposes, a compression rating of 90 might be best.
Softer cover balls will also grip your club better, creating a greater backspin effect. For this reason, you may also want to choose golf balls with soft cover.
Since soft-core balls might not always be available to you, you may find it useful to master back-spinning a hard-core ball as well. Before you do, you may want to get a feel for the process by mastering soft-core backspin., You should prioritize lofted clubs, like irons, wedges, or lob wedges. These clubs are the easiest to impart backspin with, especially the lob wedge, so beginning with one of these can help you master this difficult shot with greater ease.Lofted clubs are preferred because to achieve a significant amount of backspin you'll need to loft your ball high.
Since height is an important factor when choosing the type of club you'll be using for your backspin shot, you should avoid clubs over a 7-iron.

, Bits of grass or turf can sometimes stick to the head of your club creating an uneven surface on it. This can negatively impact your backspin game. To prevent this from happening, inspect the clubface to see if it is worn or dirty.


Grass, dirt, or other gunk can be wiped away in most cases with a rag dampened with warm water. For more intensive cleaning, you should follow your club's care instructions.
If you notice wear, like scuff marks, scratches, or other blemishes, you may want to select a different iron, wedge, or lob wedge.
Damaged clubs can often be taken to a professional to get the clubface re-grooved if it is worn down., ""Deep,"" in this sense, generally refers to the back of the ball being closer to your back foot, as opposed to being equally between your feet (normal), or forward (closer to your front foot). Placing your ball an inch (2.5 cm) or so toward your back foot should be enough for backspin purposes.By placing the ball deeper in your stance, your club will come in contact with the ball on a downward angle, which is where your backspin comes from.
Every golfer is unique. You may find that you have the best luck with backspin with your ball even deeper in your stance, or you may find that only ½ inch (1.27 cm) backwards placement is enough.

, Placing your feet closer together, or adopting a close stance, will straighten your body. Doing so will also straighten the angle of your swing and make your club strike your ball on more of a downward angle, which will improve your backspin shot., In most normal shots, you want your club to strike the ball in a head-on, neutral fashion. When making a back spin shot, you'll want to shoot as normal, but you should focus your point of contact toward the back of the ball on the side oriented at your back foot.


You may find that it helps to choose a specific dimple on the back of the ball ball to aim at when swinging for backspin.
Striking the ball at this angle puts the ball in motion clockwise (backspinning) even as the force of your swing sends the ball towards your goal., When raising your club to swing, make sure that you raise it into a high, straight position before bringing it down to swing. When shooting for backspin, you should always come into contact with the ball before you strike the soil., When you follow through with this shot, it's almost certain that you'll dig into the turf and form a divot. When executing the backspin swing best, your divot should be shallow and relatively short.


A deep divot could signify that your angle of approach to the ball is too sharp which can negatively impact your shot. You'll have to experiment with small adjustments to your ball-address and swing to determine the cause of deep divots., In particular, you'll want to keep your wrists straight. When your club comes in contact with the ground, this can often cause your wrists to move out of alignment, which is also known as ""breaking."" Maintaining your wrist angle is integral for consistent backspin., Wind direction is highly important when learning backspin shots. Hitting into the wind will often cause your ball to go higher. The higher your ball goes, the more time it has to pick up spin.


You may find that you are never able to consistently backspin without a favorable wind. Many professionals avoid attempting this shot when the wind is against them., Short backspin shots will require a lot of power to create the necessary height your ball will need to efficiently backspin. For this reason, short backspin shots can be very difficult. You may want to start with mid- to long-range shots while learning backspin., The ""face"" of your ball is the circle you see when viewing the ball head-on. Hitting your ball lower on its back face will create even greater force in your backspin, improving it.


This characteristic is called the ""vertical gear effect."" It states that balls hit lower on the face will have greater spin than those that are hit high."
"
The key to this technique is in being able to visualize a larger circle or hole around the cup and try to put your ball inside that hole.,
Could be to the right or to the left or front or back of the hole, it doesn't matter, as long as it is inside the circumference of your imaginary hole.

,
When you line up for your putt, this is what it usually looks like:

,
How would you like it to look like this?,
Unfortunately it is not that easy.,
Now let me visually demonstrate what I am talking about.,
Now this is a daunting task for any of us 20 feet (6.1 m) away or more, especially with such a small target.,
Let’s get started with the most difficult part of the process, visualization.,
The toughest part about this is getting that firm visualization in your minds-eye.,
I realize that I stated earlier that this is all about 2 putting consistently and so the first put is all about getting it close enough to tap it in.,
Now I am sure there are a bunch of you out there thinking this guy is nuts, the most important part of the putting process is the line you take.",How to Two Putt Consistently With the Pace Putting Technique,";
,,,:

, The circle in my minds eye is 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter and we all know how hard it is to sink any 4 foot (1.2 m) put, no matter the situation. However most of the time, given the large amount of space you are visualizing gives you a nice margin for error, just like the huge driver heads of our modern golf equipment era and most of the time you can get the ball within 1 or 2 feet (0.3 or 0.6 m). Don’t get me wrong, this is a simple concept to understand but by no means and easy one to put into practice.

, Here is a typical hole:

, However, if the target is much bigger, it would be more achievable.

, Now this may not be hard for everyone or maybe even most. As I stated in the beginning of this book, most golfers are already visualizing their shots. However, all most of us do is visualize our line. In other words visualize the road or path the ball is going to take. I am asking you to simply pick a point only a few feet in front of you and forget about the line. Instead, focus on the destination (the hole of course), only this time visualize the hole being around 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter. Once you have a firm visualization in your mind, don’t aim just stroke the ball to the target. I am telling you that if you can get a firm visual in your mind, you will put the ball closer to the hole most of the time.

, I use a visual of a 4 foot (1.2 m) diameter ditch as if it has just been dug out around the cup. I do this for two reasons. I visualize simply having to get the ball into that 4 foot (1.2 m) diameter 2 foot (0.6 m) deep ditch so that it does not roll out the other end. This allows me to give it the pace needed to get it there but not so much that it rolls out the other side. If you just visualize a black hole then it will pretty much fall in at almost any pace and that defeats the purpose. The other reason I use a ditch is because the color contrast helps be clarify the vision. Of course this is the part of the program which is completely unique to you, every bit as much as your swing. Try different visualizations to see which is the easiest and clearest visual for you to focus on.

, However, for the concept to be effective you need to use at least a 4 foot (1.2 m) diameter visual from 15 feet (4.6 m) out or more, (but the diameter is again up to you and creating a visual that works) so sometimes you will leave it 4 or 5 feet (1.2 or 1.5 m) short. In that case, all you do is simply visualize a 1 foot (0.3 m) or smaller diameter, the closer you get to the hole. I can almost guarantee that you might 3 putt once in a while but you will almost never put more than that. Most of the time you will 2 putt and I think we can all live with that!

, I agree it is important but not the most important part for golfers like me who just want to 2 putt on a consistent basis. Like I stated before, we are not trying to get the ball in the hole, we are trying to get it close to the hole which takes the line part of the process out of the picture and an extreme amount of pressure off of our minds. Who cares if the ball is 2 feet (0.6 m) short, left, right or long? It is still 2 feet (0.6 m) away from the cup. Using the bowling approached my dad taught me will take care of the line enough so that you are not completely off the mark. We both know that sometimes it will happen.

Purchase a ball mark tool.,
Stick the ball mark tool in the ground near the edge of the divot that was created by your golf ball.,
Use your putter or another golf club to tap down the grass until the ground is flat and level with the surrounding green.",How to Repair a Ball Mark," This tool is normally made of plastic or metal and has 2 prongs on the end of it with a tab for you to hold. These tools can be purchased at your local sporting goods store or the golf course's pro shop for a minimal fee.;
, Turn the tool and push the grass toward the center of the ball mark. Be careful to not tear the roots of the grass, which would result in an even larger spot of dead grass. The grass on the green is very elastic. Therefore, you shouldn't do additional damage to the green by twisting and pushing your ball mark tool. Work your way around the divot until you have worked out the ground along its perimeter.


If you do not have a ball mark tool available, you can use other items to lift and push in the turf. Your golf tee or the pencil you use when writing on your scorecard are both acceptable substitutes. Use these in the same manner; however, since they are slimmer, you will need to tilt them at an angle to work through more of the grass with each twisting motion.

, This will restore the slope of the terrain to match the rest of the green.

Push off and start riding.,
Position your feet near the center of the board.,
Lean your weight in the direction you want to turn.,
Try to keep your balance.,
Adjust your board to make turning easier.",How to Turn on a Skateboard1," Place your front foot on the board just behind the nose and push off against the ground with your back foot. Give yourself three or four strong pushes to get moving at a decent speed. Set your back foot on the board. You should now be cruising along, aimed straight ahead.It’s recommended that you get comfortable with the basics of skateboarding before attempting to learn how to turn.
Strap up with the proper protective gear—a helmet, wrist guards and knee and elbow pads—to safeguard yourself against scrapes, bruises and more serious injuries.;
, Rest your lead foot right above the bolts that attach the board’s trucks to the deck. Slide your back foot forward until it’s in the same position over the rear trucks. This will ensure that you’re in the most stable position to keep your balance while turning.Your feet should be lined up straight across the deck to create the leverage needed to generate the turn.
Keep your feet away from the nose and tail. Putting too much weight on either edge will lift one set of wheels or the other off the ground.

, Decide whether you want to steer to the left or to the right. If you ride regular (left foot up front), initiate a mild left turn by leaning your weight back over your heels, so that more pressure is put on the rear edge of the deck. Right turns can be performed by leaning over the toes.The general idea is to simply lean in the direction you want to go. The fine-tuned mechanics of the skateboard will take care of the rest.
These directions should be reversed for goofy riders (those who place their right foot up front)., As the deck tilts, all your weight will be over the wheels on one side of the board. This will cause them to veer in the direction you’re leaning, resulting in a smooth, gradual turn. Bend your knees and lower your center of gravity slightly as you steer to keep from being forced off balance by the motion of the turn.


If you find yourself falling off to the side of the board, you’re probably leaning too hard. Don’t be too heavy-footed. Try repositioning your weight delicately at first and working your way up to wider curves.

, If you find that it’s difficult to perform leaning turns on your board, it may be because your trucks are too tight. Use a crescent or socket wrench to take a little tension out of the nut that secures and tightens the trucks. This will enhance their range and ease of motion, allowing you to glide into turns effortlessly.Looser trucks will make leaning turns easier, but will reduce the overall stability of the board, as the deck will be able to move around more freely of the wheels.Play around with different levels of tightness in the trucks to strike the right balance between stability and ease of movement.

"
"
Get moving.,
Place your feet in the proper position.,
Push down carefully on the tail.,
Redirect the nose to turn.,
Return the front wheels to the ground.",How to Turn on a Skateboard2," Push off and begin riding. Work up a little bit of speed before you approach your turn. Stay poised on the balls of your feet, ready to shift your weight.


If you’re not moving fast enough when attempting a kick-turn, you’ll most likely just end up spinning in place over the rear wheels.

, As with the leaning method, keep your front foot rooted over the bolts of the front trucks. To perform a kick-turn, however, your back foot will need to be on the tail (the upturned rear edge of the board). Slide your rear foot back until it is in the center of the tail. You’re now in position to turn by lifting the front end of the board.Keep your weight centered over the middle of the board. There’s no need to lean one way or the other as there is for an easier turn.
Don’t put any weight on the tail until you’re actually ready to start turning. This is a good way to get acquainted with the concrete.

, Using a slow, controlled motion, push down on the tail with your back foot and distribute your weight evenly between both feet momentarily. Pushing down on the tail while your center of balance is situated over the rear wheels will cause them to act like a teeter-totter, raising the nose of the board.Pushing down too hard or too fast will force the tail into the ground, killing your speed, at best, or resulting in a nasty spill.
Lifting the nose to steer will probably feel pretty foreign at first. Practicing the “manual”, a skill that involves balancing on the back wheels while rolling or stationary, may help you get a feel for negotiating your weight on the tail., From here, you can rotate the nose of the board in whichever direction you wish to turn. Guide the front end of the board with your lead foot and use a winding action of the shoulders and hips to swing the nose around. Using this technique will enable you to perform much sharper, more drastic turns, and will also come in handy for learning skills such as cornering, carving, etc.Kick-turns can be used change the direction of the board up to about a 30 degree angle while moving. Any sharper than that and you’re likely to lose control.
Be careful—the longer the front wheels stay off the ground, the greater the chance of the board flying out from under you.

, Once you’ve completed the turn, shift your weight to your lead foot to set the front wheels back down on the ground. Make sure to touch down with the front wheels nice and easy to avoid clumsily dropping the nose or throwing yourself off balance. Keep riding, pushing off to generate more speed. Congrats! You’re now fully mobile!


Both methods of turning, leaning and kick-turns, are essential basic techniques to master when you’re learning how to skate.

Find the right skateboard.,
Introduce your dog to the skateboard.,
Bring the board back down.,
Roll the board around a little.,
Begin training your dog to get on the skateboard.,
Begin rewarding your dog only 1/2 the time he shows interest in the skateboard.,
Move the skateboard forward a couple feet once your dog places his paws on it.,
Place your dog so he is standing on the skateboard completely.,
Roll the skateboard back and forth slowly.,
Get your dog to mount the skateboard on his own.,
Continue trying until your dog will obey the command without the need of a reward other than praise.

",How to Teach a Bulldog to Skateboard," The board should be at least an inch wider than your dogs normal stance. Use one with older ball bearings—you want your board to travel about a meter with each push.;
, Begin with putting your dog in a carpeted room with the skateboard. Place it flat on the ground, wheels up. Praise your dog extensively for any interest it shows in the skateboard. Make noises with the board by spinning the wheels or tapping the surface. Observe your dog's response. After a few minutes, put the board away. Let your dog rest for 20 minutes or so.

, If your dog seemed fine with the board upside down, put it right side up this time. However, be sure to secure the board so that it doesn't roll around when your dog tries to play with it. Again, praise your dog for any interest in the board.

, Observe your dog's reaction—any sign of fear and you should back up a step. Try not to roll the board directly towards your dog, as this can be seen as threatening. Instead, awaken your dog's predatory instincts by rolling the board away from it. Continue for a few minutes, then take a break. Repeat. Continue to the next step when your dog is comfortable around the skateboard.


If your dog tries to get on the skateboard at any point, be sure to give it lots of praise and/or treats. Don't forget to hold the skateboard steady.

, Secure the board so that it can't move. Reward the dog the majority of the time that it shows any interest, but focus on interest involving one or more paws on the board. It's okay if your dog doesn't leave his paws on the board yet. Continue this until your dog puts a paw the on the skateboard whenever it's presented.

, Reward the majority of the time that he puts a paw on the board, and always when two or more paws are put on the board.


If your dog begins to get so frustrated that he whines/barks or stops trying, put the skateboard away and try again later and/or back up a step.

, Initially, your dog will probably move his feet as soon as the board starts rolling. Try to reward your dog with a treat in the moment before he gets off the skateboard. Put the treat directly in his mouth so that he dog doesn't have to move off the board to get it. Move on to the next step when your dog is comfortable keeping two paws on the moving board for at least 4 feet (1.2 m).

, Reward your dog extensively for standing on the still board. Phase out rewards for merely being interested in the board, and only reward some of the time for two paws. Once your dog consistently stands on the board, you are ready to move on.

, Be sure that you are holding the skateboard to keep it from shaking too much. Praise your dog for staying on the board.

, Tap the board and say the desired command to get your dog to get up on it. Move slightly back from the skateboard so that your dog is required to push forward to get the treat. Reward your dog whenever he does something desirable.

Reposition your ball illegally.Obstacles on the course provide great cover to hide what you are doing.,
Reposition your ball “legally.” When the rules allow you to move your ball before taking your next stroke, make the most use of this opportunity.,
Play hockey, not golf.,
Fudge your scorecard hole by hole.,
Fudge your scorecard after the fact.",How to Cheat at Miniature Golf1," Once you have made your drive, quickly but nonchalantly make your way up to your ball while your opponent is still teeing off. Once their ball comes to a rest, get in position to line up your next shot as soon as possible, before your opponent reaches you, while you are still out of view. Nudge your ball into a more favorable position.


When you first get your equipment, claim the green ball (if there is one) as your own. Assuming that the turf is green as well, a green ball will blend in much more than other colors, making it more difficult for your opponent to note its exact position once it comes to rest.
Use your hand to move the ball. Pretend to have dropped something if needed, or act like you are wiping something off the turf, which is permitted. Nudging the ball with your putter may cause it to roll more than you meant.;
, Improve its position a tad more favorably than what’s really allowed. Only improve it a tad, though. Don’t overreach and risk discovery.


If your ball has come to rest against a rail or obstacle, use the length of your putter’s head to reposition your ball the allowed six inches from the rail.However, unless your opponent is hovering over your shoulder, watching your every move, set your putter’s head down a centimeter or two away from the rail/obstacle. Then set your ball a centimeter or two away from the end of your putter’s head.
If your opponent’s ball knocks yours out of position, you are allowed to set your ball back where it was.Take a gamble and assume their attention was focused more on where their own ball was headed rather than where yours was originally. Place your ball a smidge closer to a more favorable position.

, When you putt, follow through with your putter as you would with a hockey stick. Guide the ball’s direction. Add more force to your ball’s momentum to cover more distance if needed.Legally, your ball should only be propelled forward by the tap of your putter, so you will have to be subtle about this if your opponent (or anyone else) is paying close attention. To do it effectively without calling attention to it, practice this on your own first.

, Technically your score is supposed to be kept by someone other than yourself,but if your opponent doesn’t know that, go with the honors system and mark your own scores. Then promptly abuse their trust in you. Shave a point off here and there.Be sensible about which holes you fudge. Other players will most likely remember those holes where you maxed out the number of permitted strokes. They would also most likely remember any holes-in-one you supposedly scored. Only shave off a point or two from your less memorable, midrange scores.

, ""Forget"" to mark your scores for a couple of holes. Give your opponent time to forget exactly how many strokes you took two holes ago before marking your points for that hole. When you add up your score at the end of the game, ""forget"" to include a hole or two in your total to shave off a few more points.

Wear eye-catching clothes.,
Use their cellphone against them.,
Distract your opponent.,
Rush your opponent.",How to Cheat at Miniature Golf2," Distract your opponent with your wardrobe. If it’s sunny out, wear bright, reflective clothing and/or jewelry that will catch the sun when you stand in your opponent’s line of sight. If it’s raining or seems like it might start to, bring an umbrella along and “unconsciously” tap it on the ground or against your thigh while they putt. If it’s windy, wear loose clothes that flap excessively.


Official games and tournaments may have dress codes.Dress within these limits as best as you can.

, Keep your own cellphone on during the game. Have your opponent’s number ready to dial. As they line up a critical shot, wait for them to swing. As soon as they draw up their backswing, “accidentally butt-dial"" them to throw them off.In an official game, all cellphones must be turned off.If you have a willing partner-in-crime, have them call your opponent during the game in case they left theirs on.

, Keep plenty of change and/or keys in your pocket. Jostle them around “absently” as your opponent tees off or putts.Sniff, sneeze, or cough when they swing. Act startled by an imaginary bee. Be strategic about when you do this to avoid accusations.If the game is supervised by a judge or referee, make a show of trying your best to not distract your opponent. Fake a few sneezes here and there and mention allergies to establish credibility. When it is your opponent’s turn to play, stay within their line of sight and pretend to fight down a sneeze. Create an air of suspense that will take their mind off their own game.

, Utilize the party behind you, who has to wait for you and your opponent to finish each hole before they can advance.Slow your own game down as much as possible so the other party has plenty of time to finish the hole behind you. Then comment to your opponent how people are waiting for the two of you to finish up. Make your opponent feel as though the onus is on them to hurry up and free the hole for the next party.


According to strict rules, the first player to tee off at any given hole has 90 seconds to do it once they reach it. Use all 90 seconds to give the next party more time to catch up.

Keep rules to yourself.,
Confuse “points” and “strokes.” According to strict rules, when you fill out your scorecard after each hole, you add a point for each stroke you took.,
Force them to play longer drives.,
Let your opponent play balls from the edge.,
Make them play “dirty.” Technically, you are allowed to clean your ball and/or the course at any time once the ball is in play, as long as it isn’t actually moving.Unless you need to do a little cleaning to improve your own game, don’t share this with your opponent.",How to Cheat at Miniature Golf3," If you are playing a casual game and your opponent is unfamiliar with the rules, be selective about which ones you share. Depending on your weaknesses, keep mum about those that will prevent you from winning. “Forget” to inform them of others right up until a situation occurs when those rules benefit your game.


Offer to pay for the round. The rules of the course are often posted by the cashier, so tell your opponent that you will take care of paying and collecting equipment while they just “hang out over there,” where they won’t see the posting.

, However, every course has a maximum number of strokes allowed per hole. For time’s sake, when you are one stroke away from reaching the maximum and still haven’t holed your ball, you are supposed to automatically add the last point without bothering to actually take the stroke, since it makes no difference in the end.When you explain this rule to your opponent, word it in a confusing manner so they will take an extra stroke and score an extra point (remember: the lowest score wins). For example:


If the course has a seven-stroke limit, you are supposed to automatically score a “7” on your card if you still haven’t holed the ball after six strokes. Instead of specifying this, explain the rule in vaguer terms. Make the concept clear and keep referring to the “seven-stroke limit,” but don’t clarify any other numbers. Fool them into thinking that they should play seven strokes and then automatically score themselves an “8.”

, When you play holes that feature a sharp incline rising from the tee-off area, wait to see if your opponent’s ball ends up rolling all the way back. Watch to see how they attempt their second drive. Technically, if your ball rolls over and past the tee-off line on its way back to you, you are allowed to place it back on the tee-off line at the exact spot where it crossed.If your opponent is unaware of this, let them play from where their ball comes to rest. The extra distance that they have to cover may lead to yet another stroke.


The more often this happens, the more suspicious they will be if you end up needing to make use of this rule later on. The first time it happens, pretend to be distracted by something else and make a point of looking away when they line up and make their second drive. If it happens again, do the same thing. But after that, inform them of the rule as if you only just noticed what they were doing and apologize for not having caught it sooner.

, If your ball comes to rest near the very edge of the fairway or green, you are allowed to reposition your ball by setting it the length of your putter’s head away from the edge, so you have enough room for a clean stroke.Leave this unmentioned unless you need to do it. Until then, let your opponent play their own ball as it lies, regardless of where that is.


If you need to reposition your ball, do so without comment and, if possible, when your opponent isn’t looking. If you can do it without being noticed, don’t mention what you did.
If your opponent notices you repositioning your ball and asks what you’re doing, muddle your phrasing as you explain the rule. Technically, you can reposition your ball whenever it is “near” the edge. Confuse this with “at” or some other term that makes it seem like you can only do this when your ball is physically touching the edge. This way they will continue to play some balls that they would otherwise be allowed to reposition.
The same rule applies to repositioning your ball if it comes to rest within six inches of an obstacle.Leave this rule unmentioned as well until you need to utilize it.

, Force them to play balls covered in grime or about to travel through a hazard that isn’t actually part of the course.


This is a less suspicious rule to leave unmentioned. You probably won’t need to handle their ball at all, so you would have no way to know that it’s dirty.

Familiarize yourself with putter specifications.,
Determine what type of putter you have.,
Take careful measurements.,
Lay the club down with the club face up.,
Measure the putter grips.,
Expand measurement parameters for extended putters.",How to Measure a Putter," Putter specs differ from other clubs. Putters can be longer than other clubs, which are limited to a maximum length of 48 inches (1.22 m), but they cannot be less than 18 inches (.46 m). Certain lengths are good starting points in selecting a putter. For men, a length of 35 inches (.89 m) is considered standard. For women, 34 inches (.86 m) is typical. This is a sliding scale, however, based on your height and putting style. Extended putters often exceed 40 inches (1.02 m) in length.

, Many kinds of putters are available. For measuring purposes, they can be categorized into two groups: heel-shafted and center-shafted. A heel-shafted putter is a club whose shaft intersects the club head at the club head's heel. The standard blade putter is the most common heel-shafted putter. A center-shafted putter is a putter whose shaft joins the club head directly at its midpoint. Heavy, belly and long putters are examples of center-shafted putters.

, Slightly different steps are taken to measure center- and heel-shafted putters.


Lay the club down with the club face up.
Extend the tape measure from the top of the club grip to sole of the club head. The sole of the club head is the point where the head impacts the ground.
Note the measurement. This is the exact length of the putter.

,


Extend the tape measure from the point where the club is soled on a plane parallel to the shaft. Be sure the distance between the tape measure and the shaft of the club remains the same as you measure.
Extend the tape measure beyond the length of the club. Put a straight edge across the top of the club's shaft. Make sure the straight edge is long enough to intersect the tape measure.
Note the point where the straight edge meets the tape measure. This is the exact length of the putter.;
, Putter grips must meet precise specifications. These include:


Minimum length: 7 inches (17.8 cm)
Maximum diameter: 1.75 (4.4 cm)

, Extended putters can have two grips. They must meet the standards of conventional putters in addition to the following criteria:


The top grip must be at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) long.
The grips must be separated by at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).

, This is not technically necessary, but it makes maneuvering the unwieldy club much easier.


Place rubber pads on the inside of your vice to give your club a little give when you are working. It is easy to accidentally bend your club if you have it locked firmly in a vice.

, Make sure you have enough room to work around the grip of the club.

, You will be using liquid solvent, so be careful how you drip.

,, It should just peel back easily.

, You can also use lighter fluid or something similar, but specialized solvent is best. You want to get the solvent underneath the grip, between the shaft and the grip.

, You can use a straight razor here or just try to peel it off. Clean the shaft where the old grip and tape used to be.

, Peel off the backing of the second side. You can use professional golf grip tape, or tape you can pick up at any hardware store. Tape as far down the shaft as the new grip will extend.

, Try to cover the entire surface area.

, Stick a golf tee into the hole at the end of the grip to keep the fluid in.

, It will slip on easily because of the solvent. Pull out the golf tee that is in the end of the grip and force the grip all the way on. Do all this over a bucket or something to avoid a mess.

, Make sure you line up any graphics or logos to keep the grip from getting twisted.

, Using the hack saw, carefully cut the club where you marked it. Be sure keep fingers away from blade for your safety.

, The metal you just cut will be hot so set it aside for several minutes and allow to cool down., Take the sand paper and carefully smooth the end of the shaft. It will be sharp, and you do not want to rip the new grip that you will put on later.

, Put the new grip along the shaft to see how far down it will extend. This is how far you want the tape to go on each side.

, This will lubricate the tape so you can easily slide the grip over it. This solvent will dry up and become a sticky glue.

, Hold your finger to the tee-sized hole at the end of grip and spray the solvent into the other end. Shake this around to lubricate the inside of the grip.

, With your finger still holding all the solvent liquid inside the grip, slide the big hole onto the shaft.

, In order for the tape and solvent to fully set, allow time for it to dry."

Understand the difference in your golf clubs.,
Identify the 3 separate areas of your golf bag.,
Place your woods, irons and putters into the 3 separate areas.,
Add golf balls.,
Put some golf tees in your bag.,
Pack additional accessories.",How to Load a Golf Bag," You may have up to 14 clubs in your golf bag, so getting to know what each of them do will help you in loading your golf bag.


Identify your woods. Also called drivers, woods are the golf clubs you will use to hit the golf ball long distances. Woods will feature a large clubhead and a long shaft leading up to the handle.
Pick out your irons. Irons have a shorter shaft than your woods and feature a flat angled clubhead. These golf clubs are designed for shots as you approach the green or from more difficult places like in the woods, on the rocks, at the base of a hill or in sand pit. Golfers typically have more irons than woods in their golf bags.
Find your putters. Putters are primarily designed to tap a ball in order to roll it along the grass towards the cup and into the hole.;
, If you look into the top of your empty golf bag, you will see dividers creating three separate entry points where you may place your golf clubs.

, Designate a section for each type of golf club. Typically, golfers load their clubs with the woods in the top compartment, irons in the middle compartment and putters in the bottom compartment.


Stick the handles of the golf clubs into the open areas first when loading. The clubheads will be sticking out of the top of your golf bag when the golf clubs are loaded correctly.

, On the side of your golf bag, there should be extra pockets. In a regular game of golf, it's common to lose golf balls, so pack extra balls in a side pocket of your golf bag.

, Golf tees are the short pegs you use to hold your golf ball off the ground before hitting it with one of your woods at the beginning of each hole. It is common to go through several tees during a golf game, so pack extra tees in a side pocket of your golf bag.

, Once you have everything you need to play golf, you can pack other accessories. As an example, many golfers use specialty gloves that help them grip the handle of the club better. Others pack a towel on hot days to clear the sweat from their brow.

Let your kids know what mini golf is.,
Planning your course.,
Design your course.,
Choose your type of course.,
Create your holes.,
Get the gear.,
Keep score.",How to Make a Mini Golf Course1," Mini golf is a game where players try to get a ball in a hole in the least number of shots. Mini golf is fun because you can create fun obstacles for your holes. While traditional golf is played with 18 holes, mini golf is played with nine but you can vary how many holes depending on the location., Plan your course based on time and resources. If you have very young children, you can keep the course as simple as possible and use large colourful balls or tennis balls to keep the game easy. You can even just have one hole instead of nine if your kids are toddlers. Let your family help you plan the course to unleash their creativity.Some kids may work on the course for weeks. Older kids enjoy creating complex obstacles to challenge each other.

, Begin by brainstorming your ideas for each hole. Draw them out on paper or a whiteboard. If you have played mini golf before it’s helpful to give examples of holes that you have enjoyed before. Figure out what you can use around the house to simulate similar obstacles.For example, use containers that your ball can pass through, books to build tunnels, or stuffed animals that the ball needs to move passed.
You may use around nine red plastic cups for your holes if you do not have enough containers.

, You may create a putt-putt zoo if you have many stuffed animals. Use your stuffed animals as obstacles for every hole. If you want to play outdoors, use the driveway for faster play. Play throughout your house if you have adequate space and time.The putt-putt Zoo is basically a jungle themed course. Use painter’s tape to secure your holes down and set them around the room. Place the stuffed animals as both decorations and obstacles for each course. For example, if you have a particularly large stuffed bear you can get players to putt through the bear’s legs to get to the hole. You may also have each player make the noise of the animal at the obstacle. This is a great course for very young children.
The driveway mini-golf course is great for accuracy as the difficulty increases as you place the holes further and further away. Tape down your cups as each hole and place them at varying distances from the edge of the driveway. Use the edge of the driveway as your starting point.
Playing throughout your house is the most creative and ambitious course to make as you have many resources at your disposal. You can allow each player to design their own hole or sets of holes. You may also give each room a theme.

, Use red plastic cups that you can purchase online or the dollar store and painter’s tape to secure them as your holes. Search through the house for obstacles and decoration for your holes. Here are nine example holes:Hole 1: Create a ramp with a book leaning against musical chimes or a toy xylophone. If hit properly, the ball moves up the ramp and over the chimes to create a fun sound before it makes it to the hole.
Hole 2: Use canned food or cereal boxes as obstacles and use your kitchen to create a fun food theme.
Hole 3: Use a footrest as a tunnel for the ball to go through before it reaches the hole.
Hole 4: Decorate holes with toys like toy soldiers and tanks for a war theme.
Hole 5: Create a tunnel with an empty soda carton. Simply cut both sides with scissors to create a hole large enough for the the ball to pass through and tape it to solid ground with painter’s tape.
Hole 6: Create a soft sloping ramp by covering a footstool with a yoga mat and placing a dish towel underneath to slow down the ball as it passes over the matt.
Hole 7: Take a toy racetrack and create an incline onto a chair. Place the hole at the seat of the chair and tape it down with painter’s tape so that the ball has to travel up the incline and onto the chair.
Hole 8: Tie a piece of string onto a toy tambourine. Swing the tambourine back and forth slowly as player tries to putt into the hole to create a moving obstacle. This may be fun if you allow other players to control the tambourine.
Hole 9: Try to get as creative as you can for the final hole. For example, create a wall with toys, cups, and books leaving only a small opening big enough for the ball to pass through and make it into the cup.

, Whether you use real putters or purchase large plastic clubs for toddlers, make sure that the gear is safe and appropriate for the age of the players. You may also purchase fun and colourful golf balls online or at your local toy store., You may print out a fun scorecard online or simply keep the score using a pen and paper. Mark down the number of attempts each player takes to finish each hole. The player with the lowest score wins."

Create a loop-de-loop.",How to Make a Mini Golf Course2," Use medium-density fiberboard (MDF), 54x72-inch piece of green felt, bottom of two five gallon buckets, deck baluster, composite wood balusters, 2 inch PVC elbow pipe, 3 inch PVC pipe fitting, plastic drop cloth, green welcome mat or artificial turf, spray adhesive, wood glue, and cyanoacrylate glue that you can purchase at your local hardware store. MDF is smooth and easy to work with as it is a perfect flat surface for a golf ball to roll on.You may need added material if you want to create elaborate obstacles such as water hazards. This design has rough and a loop-de-loop.

, Take your sheet of MDF and line up your deck balusters so they fit flush around the edges. Use a miter box and backsaw to cut the balusters to fit exactly, corner to corner., Use wood glue on each baluster as you line them up against the edges of your MDF. There should be a few inches of space between the lines of wood glue so that you may dab fast-setting cyanoacrylate.The cyanoacrylate acts to clamp the balusters as the wood glue dries so make sure the balusters are lined up correctly as the cyanoacrylate sets.

, Close to one end of your MDF panel, mark of your hole slightly off-center. Make a hole at this mark with a drill fitted with 4-inch hole saw. Flip the panel over once the drill has poked through and continue cutting the hole from the other side to prevent the MDF from splintering., Clamp your piece of felt on a worktable so that it slightly stretches. Away from the felt, lay your MDF on plastic drop cloth and spray it with adhesive. Use long, even strokes to spread the adhesive throughout the entire hoard. Use adhesive on the felt as well., Make sure the felt is smooth and place the MDF at the center of the felt. Be sure to turn the MDF over without letting it touch the felt until you are sure that it is in the correct position before pressing it down.The balusters on the bottom of the panel and the hole will need a spray of adhesive. Allow everything to dry.

, Cut excess felt with a utility knife and a framing square. Cut 1 ½ inches from each direction as you hold the square corner to the panel corner. Cut the felt diagonally., You will need help to pull along all the sides in order to lift the felt evenly and wrap it over your balusters., Section off the felt in the hole by using scissors to cut as if you were cutting a pizza. Cover the sides of the hole by pulling up each wedge and wrapping it tightly. Cut off any excess felt once the felt is folded over and inside of the hole is covered., Create a two inch PVC pipe fitting using a hacksaw on the PVC pipe fitting. Once cut, drop the two inch tall fitting into the hole., Use the lengths of composite baluster to line your course. The balusters will stay in place for balls to bounce off them. You may also customize your hole by adjusting them. You may create corner bumpers by adding short angled pieces., Form some rough by cutting green welcome mat or artificial turf. Create obstacles by placing pieces around the course. You may glue them down or leave them separate so you can adjust with each play., Cut off the lower three inches from each of your two five gallon buckets. This should leave an inch band at the bottom of each bucket. Cut an opening in each circular piece. Create a channel by bringing the pieces together by lining up the open ends. Spread them apart to create your loop.Use duct tape to secure your loop once you have it adjusted to your preference, screw the sides down to angled pieces of composite baluster that create a block.

If you’re left-handed, a push hook starts to the left of the target, but curves back to the right., For right-handed golfers, a straight hook will start at the target but veer off to the left. If you’re left-handed, a straight hook will also start straight towards the target but will then curve to the right., A pull hook starts left of the target for right-handed golfers. It will start right of the target for left-handed golfers.Balls hit with pull hooks often fly low or roll too far."

Find a club of proper length.,
Grip the club with two hands.,
Place the top of the club’s shaft just above your belly button.,
Position your feet with the ball nearly in the center.,
Square your stance.,
Lean over the ball.,
Swing the club in a pendulum motion.,
Follow through.",How to Use a Belly Putter1," Since a belly putter must anchor at your belly, length is more important than in traditional putters. To choose the right length, stand up straight and hold the club against your stomach. A club of proper length will reach just above your belly button. You don’t want your putting stance to be too upright or too hunched over.In your putting stance, the club will anchor at this point.;
, Hold the belly putter as you would a traditional putter with both hands positioned on the lower end of the grip. Your palms rest on the back of the shaft, and your fingers and thumbs wrap around the front, away from your body. Your dominant hand should be lower on the grip than your other hand because it will be the one that directs the putter.


You may need to move your hands farther up or down on the shaft depending on your height and the length of the club.

, This will be the anchor point that allows the club to swing without twisting. The shaft should sit slightly to the top left of the belly button for right-handed players, and slightly to the top right for left-handed players.This may take a little adjustment depending on your personal preference. Some players rest the top of the shaft directly over their belly button rather than to either side. Find what works best for you.

, The goal is to ensure a stroke in which the club hits the ball at a 90-degree angle, not tilted forward or backward. If you position the ball near your front or back foot, the angle of the club will be affected, impeding a clean hit.The ball should be about a foot in away from your feet, depending on how tall you are. Shorter or taller players will have different size clubs that may require the ball to be slightly closer or farther away.

, As with a traditional putter, the first step is to square your feet up so you are positioned parallel to the hole you are putting to. Keep both feet straight ahead of you. Your feet should be about shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees just a little.


You will need to adjust for uneven greens as you would with traditional putting. If the green has any slope, point your feet accordingly so your stance is aimed parallel to where you want the ball to go.

, Placing the club’s head behind the ball, bend your torso slightly forward so you are almost leaning on the club. Your eyes should be looking down directly over the top of the ball. This helps you line the club up for the shot. It also helps the club swing as smoothly as possible.As you swing, keep your head in a fixed position and your eyes on the ball.

, Keeping the club anchored to your belly, rotate your back shoulder up for the backswing, then follow through with an equal tilt of your front shoulder. The club should swing smoothly back and smoothly forward, maintaining the same speed through the whole swing.


Your wrists should stay in a fixed position through the whole swing. Do not twist them in any way as this will affect the shot. Your shoulders should be the only part of your body that moves.

, As with traditional putting, your club should swing as far forward as it does backward. The length of putt you are making will determine how far back you need to swing. Longer putts, depending on the slope of the green, still require extra strength, as do traditional putters.


You don’t want to strike the ball and let the club stop. Rather, it follows through to set the ball’s path.
Shorts putts require very little backswing, but you still must follow through to an equal point once you hit the ball.

"
"
Alter your grip.,
Examine the path of your body with the club.,
Maintain your speed while rotating.,
Check the positioning of your clubface.",How to Fix a Golf Hook2," Put your right hand in a position that is more neutral. You shouldn’t be able to see your left thumb. Adjust your right pointer finger under the handle in a “trigger” position to cradle the club.Unless you have superb timing, letting your right palm leave the club during your swing will result in a snap-hook.This step assumes the golfer is right-handed. Perform this with the opposite hand than instructed if you’re left-handed.

, You may be closing the club head too early. Instead of making a motion like you’re throwing the club head at the ball, you want to move your body with the club. Imagine there is a dagger at the top of your club that you are aiming at the ball in your downswing. This will help you to prevent uncocking your wrist too early., Rather than focusing on trying to make a correction, focus on the movement of your body as a smooth motion. Carry the clubface through the swing without hesitation. You want your body to guide the club, so that you don’t overcompensate with movement of your wrists and hands., A clubface is the side of the golf club’s head that hits the ball. Rotate the clubface open on the backswing as your arms and hips rotate. When the club is waist-high, the clubface should be toe-up. As you swing through, swing the clubface open to the left (or to the right if you’re left-handed).An “open” clubface means that the toe of the club is too far back.Don’t approach the ball like a base that you’re sliding into, or you’ll end up trying to get underneath the ball rather than giving your swing stability. The clubface should remain square throughout the hit."
"
Hold a golf tee in your grip.,
Practice your swing at home using a hula hoop.,
Pin one arm to your chest.",How to Fix a Golf Hook3," The palm of your right hand should apply continuous pressure to the thumb of your left hand. (If you’re left-handed, the palm of your left hand should apply pressure to the thumb of your right hand.) Try keeping a tee between those contact points as you swing the club.Keep your right hand over your left hand on the grip during the downswing – or, if you’re left-handed, keep your left hand over your right hand.This will help you become aware of the grip pressure you should maintain, so that you don’t change your grip during the swing and thereby hook the ball.

, Don’t use your golf club for this exercise; all you need is the hula hoop. Put the hula hoop over your body so that it is behind the back of your head and in front of your upper thighs. Hold the hula hoop as if you are holding a golf club, and rotate your body back and forth the way you would swing the club.The motion of your swing will be held in check by the curvature of the hula hoop.

, For this drill, your arm will act as your prop. Without using your golf club, pretend you are making a backswing. Hold your lead arm against your chest with your trail arm. Bend your trail arm like you’re curling a weight towards your heart, with your palm holding the upper part of your trail arm behind the elbow. Your lead arm should be pinned against your chest and your gloved hand does the swinging.Practice swinging. Your motion should rotate your body as if you’re hitting the ball with the back of your gloved hand. This will give you the feeling of keeping your lead arm in sync with your body.
If you’re right-handed, your lead arm is your left arm and your trail arm is the right arm. If you’re left-handed, it’s the opposite.

Hold the top of the shaft with your non-dominant hand.,
Hold the grip of the shaft with your dominant hand.,
Use your dominant hand to swing in a pendulum motion.,
Try the pinch variation.",How to Use a Belly Putter2," Rather than having two hands placed together low on the grip, one hand will anchor the club against your belly, while the other swings the club. The first three fingers of your non-dominant hand should be on the front of the club, your pinkie will rest on the back of the club, and your thumb should be on top.Your thumb will be the anchor against your belly as opposed to the shaft in the first method.

, Fully extend your arm to grab the grip of the club, leaving a slight bend in your elbow. Your hand should be as far down on the shaft as possible, as opposed to near the top by your other hand. You can hold the club as you would any other with your knuckles wrapped around the back and your fingers in front.


Another option for positioning your hand is to hold the club loosely with your fingers on the front and your thumb on the back of the club.

, This is different than when you use a traditional putter, moving both shoulders during the swing. Using only your dominant hand on the shaft, pull the club backward to the desired spot for the swing, then complete the pendulum motion swinging the club forward.The club is held anchored to your body with one hand and swung with the other hand, allowing for a smooth motion without twisting of the wrists.

, When you are first gripping the club with your non-dominant hand, hold the shaft between your middle finger and ring finger. Use your index finger and thumb to pinch your shirt. This gives you a slightly more fluid anchor point than when the shaft is tight against your stomach.You still want the anchor to be steady and not move around during the swing. It may be a little harder to perfect than the tightly anchored version, but it does allow for easier movement.

Adjust the grip on the golf club.,
Increase the swing.,
Target the golf ball.,
Stand properly.,
Tip the club in slightly.,
Take a practice swing or two.,
Hit the golf ball.",How to Cure a Golf Slice," Turn the grip slightly to the right (left handed golfers should turn grip slightly to the left). Do not grab the club more tightly. Hold it only tight enough to maintain control over the golf club during the swing. Any wrist or arm tension indicates that the grip is too tight.;
, Pull the golf club farther back before swinging. This will increase the speed of the swing. Bring the club straight back and follow through on the swing.

, When placing the ball on the tee, make sure the writing on the ball faces the direction that the ball should travel. This will help keep the head down and on the ball when swinging.

, Stand straight with the shoulders relaxed, and bend the knees slightly. Feet should be shoulder width apart, and facing forward, and the head should be down with the eyes focused on the ball. The stance should feel natural.

, Line the ball up with the front foot, and tip the club face in towards the body just a little bit.

, Stand away from the ball, and concentrate on the grip and the stance. Pay attention to the swing and practice it a few times before trying to hit the ball.

, Bring the golf club straight back and follow through on the swing. Keep head down and follow the ball onto the fairway.

Reattach the wheels to your skateboard.",How to Clean Skateboard Wheels," Turn the skateboard over so it is resting on the deck, with the wheels facing up. Use a ½ inch or 13mm socket wrench to twist and remove the axle nuts on the outer sides of the skateboard wheels.Keep all wheel materials (nuts, washers, etc.) together in one place so you can easily find and attach them later.;
, Once you have removed the wheels from the skateboard, use the metal rod to which the wheels were attached (called the truck axle), to pry the bearings from the wheels.Position the wheel on the end of the truck axle so the metal rod is slightly inserted through the wheel, to the first bearing. Allow the axle to catch on the bearing, and pull the top of the wheel away from the board. This leverage movement is similar to using a bottle opener to remove a bottle top. Once the bearing is removed from one side of the wheel, use the same prying technique to remove the other bearing on the other side of the wheel. Repeat this process for all of the wheels. Keep the wheel bearings and the wheels separate from each other.


If you can manage to remove the bearings in this way, you can also try using a screwdriver to pry out the bearings. Simply hold on to the sides of the wheel out in front of you, insert the tip of the screwdriver in the front of the wheel, and pull the screwdriver to the side to release the bearing.When you remove the bearings from the wheels, a bearing spacer will fall out from the center of the wheel.Keep this in a safe place so you can reassemble the wheel and bearings later.

, Use a rag to wipe the surface of all the wheels. Use your fingers to loosen any rocks or gravel that may be stuck in the wheels., In a large container such as a bucket or bowl, create a mixture of water (approximately ½ a gallon) and a couple teaspoons of dishwashing soap.Stir this mixture until the water gets sudsy. Add all the wheels to the soapy water, and allow them to soak for approximately 10 minutes.


Be sure that you are only soaking the wheels of your skateboard, not the bearings., Remove the wheels from the soapy water and use a soft rag or a soft bristled toothbrush to gently scrub the wheels and remove any dirt and debris.Once all the wheels have been gently cleaned, use a paper towel to completely dry the wheels.


Because dirt can get trapped in any small nook and cranny, be sure to clean the inner part of the wheel along with the outer surface.

, Use a razor blade to carefully wedge in between the bearing shield and the edge of the bearing, and push the blade down to pry the bearing shield from the bearing.Be very gentle while removing the shield, you don’t want to damage the shield and not be able to attach it back on later.


Some bearings only have one shield, while others have shields on both sides.

, Citrus cleaner is the safest choice for cleaning your bearings. Other harsh cleaners such as denatured alcohol, mineral spirits, gasoline, or turpentine could all irreparably damage your bearings. As far as cleaning the bearings with the citrus cleanser, you have a couple of options: you can heavily spray each individual bearing with the citrus cleaner and wipe them down, or you can soak the bearings in a citrus cleaner either in a small container or by way of a bearing cleaning kit.A bearing cleaning kit can be found at most skate shops, and they essentially allow you to soak the bearings in an easier and more manageable fashion. With bearing cleaning kits, you can shake the small container to disperse the cleaning solution.



Spraying the bearings: To spray the bearings, simply hold a bearing between your fingers and generously spray the citrus cleaner all over the bearing.The natural citrus cleaner will dissolve and remove built up dirt without damaging the bearing materials. After you completely spray and spin the bearing, use a soft rag to thoroughly dry the bearing.Soaking the bearings: Fill up a small container or bowl with citrus cleaner and drop the bearings into the container.The bearings should be completely submerged in the cleaner. Allow the bearings to soak for about 5 minutes and then remove them from the cleaner. Spin the bearings to make sure the entire bearing has been exposed to the cleaning solution.Use a soft cloth to wipe off any remaining dirt and dry the bearings completely.
Consider using a hair dryer or compressed air camp to further dry the bearings.This will help to ensure no rust formation inside the bearings.

, Once the bearings are completely dried, they need to be lubricated. Some lubricants that work well for bearings are skateboarding oils, sewing machine oils, or electronic oils. They work well because they’re thinner lubricants made especially for tiny parts that do a lot of movement.Apply only 2-3 small drops of lubricant per bearing. Once you have applied the lubricant, spin the bearing to make sure all the bearing balls get coated. Wipe off any excess lubricant from the outside of the bearings with a clean paper towel.


Too much lubricant can clog up the bearing rather than making it move smoothly. When in doubt, the less lubricant the better.
Do not use thick oils as a lubricant on your bearings. Avoid lubricants like olive oil, vegetable oil, or motor oil., Place a bearing shield over the bearing, and use your thumbs to snap the shield back into place.You may need to apply one or two shields to each bearing, depending on how many shields you started out with.


The shields will help keep the bearings lubricated and protected.

, After both the bearings and wheels are clean, insert the bearings back into the wheels. Insert a bearing on one side of the wheel and use your fingers to snap it into place. Then, turn the wheel over, insert the bearing divider, and snap the other bearing into place.Do this for all bearings and wheels from your skateboard.

, One by one, slide each wheel onto the truck axle. Put the axle nut back on the outside of the wheel, and use the socket wrench to tighten the nut into place.Repeat this for all four wheels.

Check your grip.,
Balance correctly.,
Swing through.",How to Avoid Hooking the Ball in Golf," Make sure your right hand grips the club correctly. You should put it on the club from exactly the same position as when your arm hangs free from your shoulder. Make sure your wrist is straight, so your hand does not bend beneath the club, and put your left thumb straight into the groove of your right hand. If you grip correctly, your right thumb will point straight at your right shoulder. See the VideoJug video 'the grip' to find out how to make a perfect grip.;
, Make sure you set up with your weight on the balls of your feet. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet during the backswing, and your upper body at a constant angle throughout the swing. This allows you to swing the club freely in front of your body, so it is easy to follow through. If your balance and upper body position are good, you will finish your follow through with your right shoulder below your left.

, The action in the swing is just like any other in which you want to direct power forwards, throwing a ball, playing tennis or throwing a javelin. On your down swing, you should start turning from your legs, and let the rotation travel up your body. The earlier the lower body rotates through the ball, the later the club gets to the ball. This reduces the chance of the clubface closing before impact and curving the ball to the left. So a good grip, set-up, and swing help you to avoid unwanted hooks, letting you hit the ball true for a straighter shot.

Practice Smith grinds on all types of rails and ledges.",How to Smith Grind," To get up on the rail or ledge for a Smith grind you will need to position your body to perform an ollie.


There are two types of Smith grinds: backside and frontside. However, the trick is always performed by grinding with only the back trucks on the rail or ledge. The difference between a backside and frontside is determined by which way you are facing when you grind on the rail. If you are facing the rail, that is a frontside Smith grind. If your back is to the rail, that is a backside.
This is a complicated trick and before attempting to do a Smith grind, you should be comfortable doing a 50/50 and 5-0 grind. The 50/50 grind is a basic grind that places both trucks on the rail. The 5-0 grind places one set of trucks on the rail, causing you to balance the other end of the board above it.
It’s best to learn this trick on a flat bar or ledge. A rounded bar will be harder to balance on.;
, As you push off and start rolling you will have to shift your weight toward your back foot as you prepare to ollie.


Try pressing on the board with just the ball of your front foot to keep the nose of the board down as you start moving.
You want both of your feet covering most of the width of your board. Meaning, you don’t want to have either foot hanging off the edge of your board much.

, Come at the object at a moderate speed. You’re going to need a bit of speed to ollie up onto the rail and grind the length of it. The speed you need will vary depending on the rail. If you go too slow you can get tripped up. Too fast and the board may slide out from under you. Finding a balance will take practice.
Approach the rail or ledge so you’re almost parallel to it. You want to be at a slight angle, but if you’re angled too far your back trucks won’t land on the rail. Try approaching at roughly a forty-five-degree angle.
Spot your point of entry. Look at the spot on the rail you wish to land. This will help your body work to get there and keep you balanced. Don’t look down at your board. If you do, you won’t be able to see where you’re headed and can miss the rail and injure yourself.

, Release your compression and pop the tail of your board down while sliding your front foot forward to ollie. The speed you have will help you as will keeping your eye on your landing spot.
If you’re new to this, practice on lower rails. You need to be able to ollie high enough so that your trucks are above the rail.

, The Smith grind is similar to a 50/50 in that you want to land with your trucks on the rail. But unlike a 50/50 with both trucks hitting the rail, here just your back ones will land.Entering at a slight angle will help you to position and turn your board while in the air so that you only get your back trucks on the rail.
Try coming in at about a forty-five-degree angle or a little less.
Push the board forward a little with your feet to get close to the rail.

, Push the front part of your board down so it is tilted towards the ground at an angle from the curb. Once you land with your back trucks on the rail you want to push the tip of the board down so that the front trucks go to one side of the rail; unlike in a 50/50 when the front trucks land on the rail.
Position your back foot in the pocket of your tail where the tail begins to slope up. You want to hold your foot over your trucks or slightly behind to provide a counterbalance so the tail of the board doesn’t pop down.
Position your front foot so that you point your toes forward toward the front of the board. Or put pressure the ball of your foot.
You want your front foot on the part of the board over the front trucks. It should be at an angle comfortable to you so that you can direct the front of your board over the rail.

, As your back trucks are about to make contact with the rail or ledge, you want to kick your back foot in the direction of the rail. Think of it like stomping your trucks down to land on the rail and lock in. Once the trucks are locked in, you want to apply a lot of weight to your back foot. This weight will hold the trucks in Smith grind position.
Additionally, by putting most of your weight on the back of your board, you have more freedom of motion to get the front of your board down and to either side of the rail.

, Use your front toes or the ball of your foot to guide your nose down and away from the rail or ledge.


When grinding on a rail, you can lock your back trucks in and lean the front of your board over as far as your balance will allow.
When grinding on a ledge, you have to be careful to lock your back trucks in the center and find a more precise balance. You need to place a lot of balance on your back foot. Because you only have so much room on one side of the ledge, if you lean too far, your wheel will catch the ledge and you may roll off.

, Leaning back with the majority of your weight is what will propel your forward. Your front leg and foot are used as a counterweight and to direct the direction of your board’s front end.


If you put too much weight on your front foot, you will end up dipping the nose of your board down too far. Dipping the nose too far can cause your board to slide off the rail or ledge.
When on a ledge as opposed to a rail, keep the weight on your back foot but don’t put as much pressure on the part of your foot closest to the ledge. Too much pressure will cause you to slow because the wheel will be hitting the coping.
For example, if you ride goofy (right foot in front) and do a frontside Smith grind on a ledge, you want to lean back a bit with less pressure on your toes. For regular skaters (left foot in front) doing a backside, it’s the opposite, with less pressure on your heel.

, You can sometimes choose to ride off the end of the rail or ledge if it’s short enough, but try to get used to ollieing out of your grind. Treat the top of the rail or ledge as you would the ground and snap the tail of your board down onto it. While doing this motion, flick your front foot up and forward to bring the nose up and clear the rail or ledge.
On some rails and ledges you can ride off the edge instead of ollieing out. But this works better on shorter grinds. When riding off the edge, put more pressure on the tail of your board to lift the nose up as you exit.

, Whether you ollie out of your grind or ride off the edge, shift your weight to your body’s center to help you level out your board for a smooth landing.


If you are leaning too far back you risk landing on just your back wheels. Landing this way is fine if you are skilled enough to manual, but you risk the board shooting out from under your feet.
If you’re too forward you won’t be able to pull the nose up enough and could exit the grind with the nose of your board hitting the ground.

, Once you hit the pavement your body may be a little unbalanced. It will take time to get used to quickly adjusting and connecting all four wheels to the ground to ride away.


Bend your knees to absorb the shock of landing. Bending will also help you to center your balance and stay on your board. Use your arms to further help you balance and center your weight.

, Different surfaces will help you to get used to grinding and exiting off the rail or ledge.


Flat rails are the best to learn to do this trick on. The flat rail allows you plenty of surface area to lock your trucks into and doesn’t restrict you to one side.
Ledges are a bit harder as you have to have really precise balance and make sure you get the nose of your board far enough to one side.
Rounded rails can be tricky because the surface isn’t flat. If you don’t have exceptional balance you can easily roll too far to one side of the rail and fall.

Know that truck tightness is a matter of personal preference.,

Go out for a ride to test your trucks.,
Bring your tool with you on your first few rides to make simple adjustments after testing.",How to Tighten Skateboard Trucks1," At the end of the day, there is no ""perfect"" amount to tighten your trucks. The tighter you turn the trucks, the more difficult the board is to turn. Too loose and you won't feel like you're stable, and your turns will be wide and difficult to control.The spot right in the middle of these extremes, your perfect tightness, is based on your own style and preference. Luckily, there is a large range of rideable tightness -- this isn't rocket science!Generally, tighter pins provide more resistance on turns, key for high-speed skating.
Looser pins have a more forgiving feel on turns and landings.;
, The amount the wheels tilt back and forth depends on how tight the trucks are. If you have a board (or a friend's board) that you like, test the tightness on them and try to replicate it in your own board. The amount they wobble right and left relates to how tight they are.








, This single bolt controls the tightness of the trucks. It points directly to the ground when you're skating, and is found between the wheels.








Turn it clockwise to tighten the trucks, getting tighter turning.
Turn it counter-clockwise to loosen the trucks, getting a softer turning feel.

, Don't just tighten the trucks and hit the skate park. After tightening, ride around a bit, trying a some turns, some ollies, and basic skating. Remember that there is no ""right"" tightness-- you need to find out what works for you.








, A hard day of riding will show you all the pros and cons of your new truck set-up. But that doesn't mean you need to be stuck with your set-up all day. A skate tool is small and easy to carry. Bring it along and make adjustments as needed."

Keep practicing.",How to Varial Kickflip on a Skateboard," While you will need speed for this trick, too much speed will result in a bad landing. On the other hand, lack of speed will make the trick almost impossible to do (the board will either go too far away or will not spin enough). If you're really new to this trick, though, you can try it from a stationary position if you want to get all the steps down.






;
, Place your back foot on the topside of the tail, just as you would during a pop shove it. Your front foot should be placed on the heelside of the board, near the front bolts. If you're new to this trick and want to be a bit more steady, you can move your front foot a bit closer to your back foot. Before you attempt the varial kickflip, make sure you're comfortable enough on the board to do a pop shove it and a kickflip. This is not a trick for absolute beginners.









To get a faster spin, you can move your front foot a bit farther back.

, Bend your knees and move your hands down near them to help you get a lower center of gravity going. Keep your shoulders in line with the board so you don't lose control of it. Remember that you'll need to generate enough height to be up in the air long enough for your board to flip over completely, so it's important to get some spring in your knees to help you get up high.









Just make sure not to bend your knees too much, or you won't have enough height to get above the board.

, Just as you would do for a shove it, use your back foot to pop the board straight down, shoving a little so the board rotates as it would in a shove it, getting direction from the topside of the tail. Don't pop the tail as you would for an ollie, or the board will go in a different direction.








, This is what you'll need to do to make the board flip. Remember that you'll have to do this very quickly, almost as soon as you pop up the board with your back foot. You can think of this as doing a slight and swift kick it without applying too much force to the board. Just try to flick the board with your front foot the exact same way you would do it in a kickflip.








, You have to jump up as high as you can to give your board enough time to flip over. Lift up your arms along with the rest of your body to help you stay up above the board long enough for it to finish flipping over. When you're in the air, make sure to follow the board.









Keep an eye on your ankles. The board can spin and hit you in the ankles if you're not up high enough.

, Wait until the board has flipped over and is at the top of its height before you try to catch it with your feet. Keep your front foot out to catch the board just as you would in a pop shove it, placing it down on the board when it's done spinning. Land both of your feet on the trucks, with your back foot near the tail of the board and your front foot near the front. Bend your knees as you do this to help you get your balance and to absorb some of the shock from the board. Catch the board just as you would catch it after a shove it.









Try to land evenly on both feet. If you come down too hard on the tail, the board could flip up.

, Keep your balance on your board, your shoulders over the board, and your arms at your sides as you roll away clean.








, If you're having trouble getting this trick down, you can work on perfecting your kickflip and your pop shove it, and then bringing them together. You can practice with different levels of speed to see when it's easiest for you to get the trick down. Don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away; with enough time and hard work, you'll get there.









If you feel confident about your varial kickflip, you can even do a 360 shove it with this trick, spinning the board 360 degrees as it flips over.

Re-pack your bushings to fit your skate style.,
Try a new brand of trucks.,
Add risers to get the board higher and reduce vibrations.",How to Tighten Skateboard Trucks2," The bushings can be tightly packed or loosely packed, with the former decreasing turning and the later increasing it. When tightening your trucks, you are actually compressing the bushings, so you can get similar results by changing the bushings altogether.While not difficult, many skaters have this done at a local skate shop for the convenience.

, Not all trucks are created equally, and each company has different specs and styles. A lot of it comes down to testing different boards out and finding out what you want, but there are some things to consider for all trucks:



High or Low Kingpin: Higher pins are best for grinds, manuals, and other tricks. A lowered kingpin is best for popping ollies and kickflips.

Wider Wheels: Most wheels are standard, but heavier riders might want wider trucks, as they distribute the added weight better for smoother control., Risers are attached between your trucks and your board, providing lift for tricks. Furthermore, risers you will dampen landing vibrations, though the higher board will take some getting used.


Higher trucks can make it harder, however, to grind."

Instead, multiple thin layers of plywood and veneer are layered, glued, and then pressed together for several hours to make one deck. The standard is for 7 pieces of plywood, though some boards use 9.


Changing the thickness of the sheets or the number of pieces in the board will affect its weight, flexibility, and riding properties.
Most decks have a final thickness of roughly 10mm.;
, It should be roughly 1/17th of an inch thick. This will form the base of a basic deck. However, you can buy different types of wood and stack them appropriately for a more professional board. Most of these specialty woods are tough to find at big-box retailers, so you may need to go to a specialty store to find Baltic Birch or Canadian Maple thin enough to use.Buy two hardwood ""face"" pieces for the top or bottom in mahogany or maple for sturdy, gorgeous wood. The thickness should be the same, 1/17th of an inch.
You can buy birch or bamboo for the ""core"" wood, as it is more stable than standard plywood. The thickness should be the same.Crossband Layers are two specific pieces on the inside of the board where the wood grain runs up and down the thickness of the board, not along the face. If you can buy crossband plywood, get two sheets for the center to increase board strength., Take each piece of wood and use a paint roller to spread a thin layer of wood glue on the bottom of your face piece and the top of your first core piece of wood. Lightly push the two pieces together. Repeat this to adhere all seven pieces of plywood together. Do not simply coat one side and stick it to the other -- you need evenly-spread glue on both sides of the plywood.


If you are building a professional board, you will need to order your wood in the correct way for the best results. The standard order for the wood is:

Face sheet (your best wood)
Core sheet
Crossband sheet
Core sheet
Crossband sheet
Core sheet
Face sheet, Use masking tape to adhere the board lightly to a Styrofoam mold. If you are using a professional press you can simply lay it in the mold and move on to the next step.


Two pieces of tape, wrapped all the way around the board right before it begins to curve upwards, should work fine.
If you don't have a Styrofoam mold, fit the wood in between two old skateboard decks to mimic their shape. However, you need to be sure both decks have the same shape., Place a piece of mesh underneath the air pump to allow the air to escape easily as you suction it out. If the valve is right above the wood without mesh you may not be able to get all the air out, as the wood seals up the hole.


This bag needs to be perfectly airtight or the board will not mold.

, Have a friend nearby to help keep the bag from being accidentally pulled in between the layers of wood or the mold, as this will warp your board. Think of the vacuum as creating a press -- the top of the bag is molding the wood to fit your Styrofoam mold, and anything that gets in the way will mold bumps or cracks into the wood., Leave the board to mold all day. You need to check it every 2-3 hours to make sure the bag is still airtight, and you may need to suction more air out from time to time.

, This is often where people rip their vacuum bag, rendering it useless for future decks. Open the bag to allow some air in, then slowly slide the board out, pulling the vinyl bag out of the way. Remove the mold afterwards.

, This will be your guide to cut the board into the right shape. If you cannot use an old board, take a large piece of paper and fold it in half. Draw out the shape of half of your board -- curved on the top and bottom, flat along the sides -- starting from the folded edge of the paper. Then cut out the outline -- since you folded the paper in half, unfolding your cut out will lead to a perfectly symmetrical outline. Trace this design onto your wood.The tail of the board is usually slightly narrower than the tip, or nose., Cut along your outline to create your rough board. If you have a band saw, this may be an easier way to get good cuts.

, You want the edge of the board to curve towards the wheels, usually no more than 4-5mm. To do this, work with the top of the board face-up, then tilt the edge of the board down as you run it along the sander.


Follow up with a hand sander, then some fine sandpaper, to smooth out the edges. Use progressively lower-grit papers to smooth the entire edge out into a beautiful, even side.

, Now that the board is fully crafted, it is time to make it your own. After sanding it down you can add a stain, paint on graphics, or use a wood burner to make the board the killer, custom design you dream of.

, Unless you want a flat skateboard, you need to press the wood together into a mold, allowing you to curve your board professionally. To do this, you will need a large piece of Styrofoam (at least the size of your plywood), a vacuum with hose attachment, and a vacuum bag big enough to fit your mold and skateboard.


You will likely need to stack and glue several pieces of Styrofoam to get it 4-5"" inches thick.
The Styrofoam should have an R rating of 9 or higher to withstand the pressure of making a board.You can buy Styrofoam at most home-improvement stores in the home insulation section., You'll need this to make an outline of your board shape. Once your cut this to your desired shape you can use it to make sure you cut both sides of the Styrofoam evenly.

, Most boards curve upwards 2–4 inches (5.1–10 cm) on either end and are flat or concave in the middle. Keep it simple for now -- use a ruler to make a straight line through the middle of the board, then curve gently upwards for the last 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm) so that the ends of the board are 1/2-1 inch higher up than the middle.


This is the shape of the profile of your board, not the top of it.
Take an old skateboard deck and trace its shape on your outline for a professional shape., Trace the design on both sides. The flat bottom of your outline should be on the top of the Styrofoam block. Using a ruler, draw a line connecting the points where the board curves up across the top of the styrofoam. You should have an outline on both sides of the foam and two horizontal lines on the top of the board when you are done., When you are done, the Styrofoam will look like a flat-topped hill, curving up on each end. To do so:


Measure the distance from your outline to the top of the Styrofoam block in 5 places. Mark where you measured and the height you found at each spot. Say the first mark you make, at the beginning of the curve, is 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the top of the foam to your outline.
Draw a line with a ruler from the 1/2-inch mark on one side of the foam to the 1/2-inch mark on the other side.
Set the blade of your utility knife to this exact distance, so that the blade is only 1/2 inch long.
Cut horizontally across the your line, making a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep incision across the foam.
Cut diagonally up the foam to remove a large, rectangular, 1/2-inch chunk from the entire width of the foam.
Repeat until you have the entire curve of the board roughly outlined., Use 100 grit sandpaper to remove any rough spots. Sandpaper will quickly remove the foam, so you can use it to make sure the foam perfectly fits the outline you have drawn on the side of the foam. The outline on the side of the foam should now outline the top of your whole foam mold.


The final product will look like the inverse of a skateboard, where a finished deck would fit snugly on top of the mold., The beauty of foam molds is that they are easily customized and cheaply designed, so play with different board shapes once you get comfortable working with Styrofoam.

, Trucks are the big metal pieces that hold your wheels in place. Simply place an old deck over the new board and use a pencil to mark the location of the holes. Using a straight-drill, drill each hole straight through the board. You will have 8 holes -- two sets of four on each end.


If you cannot use an old board, you'll need to make sure you trucks are centered. To do so, use a ruler to measure at least 5 center points in the board. If the board is 10 inches (25.4 cm) thick, these center points will be 5"" from each edge. Use your ruler to connect each of these points to draw your center line. From there, line your trucks up with the midline so that the holes are equal distance from the line, mark them, and drill from here.

You want your trucks to be on the flat part of the board, starting right after the curve of the nose and tail., Skateboards, despite many innovations in the last 20 years, are actually simple machines that can be customized with just a few parts.



Deck: This is the wooden board. It has griptape on it, which resembles sandpaper.

Trucks: These are the large metal pieces on the board that house the axel and attach the wheels.

Bearings: Allow your wheels to roll smoothly. They come in steel and ceramic -- steel is standard, but ceramic have less friction and last longer, though they cost more. You need 8 of them.Wheels: There is a wide variety of wheels available, each for different board types.

Hardware: This is simply a collection 8 screws and 8 bolts needed to put your board together. A packet usually costs $2-$5., What kind of boarding do you plan on doing? Longboards are for cruising and going down hills, where street boards are the ""classic"" skateboard used for jumps, grinding, and getting around town.



Width: The wider the board, the smoother the ride but the harder it is to pull tricks. Standard is 7.5-8.5"".

Concavity: Generally, if the board is curved down more (more concave) it is more stable to ride. Flatter boards are usually easier to hit tricks on, however you should sample a few decks to determine what you like.""Wheel Base:' This is the distance between your two sets of wheels. The larger the wheel base, the wider your turning radius. Generally, taller people want a wider wheel base. It is usually 13""-15""., Simply peel off the grip tape and lay it down on the clean board, pressing firmly to adhere it to the wood. Using a screwdriver or sturdy metal instrument, rub the tape along the edge of the board until the tape makes a white outline along the entire edge. Use a box cutter or utility knife to cut away excessive grip tape.


If you have any air bubbles, poke a hole in them with the end of the knife and then press the tape into the board.
It is much easier to cut the grip tape from the bottom., Trucks are the metal pieces that connect the board to the axle and wheels, and they are usually the most durable part on the entire board. While they may seem standard, different trucks are actually used for different skaters:


Longboard riders who plan on using large wheels may need risers which put more distance between the board and the ground. They also absorb some of the force and vibration on landings.
Heavier riders need to get a wide hanger, which is the axle that keeps the wheels further apart. Most hangers reach within 1/4"" of the boards outside edges.

Bushings control how wobbly the board feels. Technical riders will want harder bushings, while people who like to cruise a lot may prefer softer bushings., There are a lot of different types of wheels out there, and you should talk to your local skate shop to see what wheels will work best for you. That said, standard skating wheels have the same general properties regardless of the manufacturer:


A good ""starter wheel"" is usually 52-55mm, 99A -- well balanced for most terrains.
Skaters who do a lot of tricks usually want smaller, harder wheels, like 50mm, 101A
Skaters who do a lot of cruising want softer, bigger wheels, like 70mm, 78B."

Wipe the board down with a rag to remove any sanding dust.,
Run your hand over the board to ensure that the surface is sanded evenly.,
Locate a decent workspace.,
Dress the part.,
Set aside cleanup materials.",How to Remove Grip Tape from a Skateboard," Take a look at your skateboard to determine what type of hardware you will need to remove the trucks. Most can be removed with a Phillips head screwdriver. However, some may use hex head screws or have no screws at all.









Lay the board on its side. Put the smallest socket of your skateboard tool over one of the nuts on your skateboard trucks. It doesn't matter which one. Using your other hand, put the screwdriver into the screw that is inside that nut. You want both hands on either side of the skateboard to provide sufficient support. Remove all the nuts and pull the trucks off of the screws. There will be eight screws left sticking up from your board.
Once you have the skate tools in place, hold the screwdriver still while turning the socket wrench, and remove the nuts from the screws. Remove the screws by placing your skateboard face down on a hard flat surface and apply pressure. This will cause the screws to pop up and allow you to pull them the rest of the way out.
A hammer can also be used to remove the screws instead of the aforementioned technique.;
, Heat an edge of the grip tape with the hairdryer for about a minute. The heat will loosen the glue and make removing the grip tape much easier. 







, This will allow you to get under the tape and the deck. Sliding the blade in and under at the proper angle will ensure there is no damage to the board. 








Hold the blade at a 45 degree angle; keeping the back of the blade pointed up. Do not force the blade. If you feel any resistance reheat that section of the grip tape using the hairdryer.

, After using the razor to peel back the edge of the grip tape, you can use your hands to finish the job. Pull gently, but firmly, to peel the grip tape away from the board. If at any point the grip tape tears or you feel resistance while peeling, repeat the step with hair dryer. 








The entire process generally should take you 5 to 10 minutes.
Lay the board on the ground while peeling away grip tape. Place one foot one the board to keep it secure while peeling away the grip tape.

, Start by sanding the edges and then work your way across the rest of the board. Using 80-grit sandpaper, sand the edges to create a rounded shape. Using 120 to 150-grit sandpaper, sand the rest of the board from top to bottom. Repeat the process of sanding the edges and brushing the dust away. When finished, the edges of your board should be smooth and perfectly rounded.









Sand the board using a belt sander or a sanding block. Use smooth, even strokes while sanding the board. You want to barely, if at all, see the outline mark when this step is complete.
Avoid inhaling debris by wearing a face mask. Also, goggles are a good way to ensure that no debris accidently find their way into your eyes. Gloves will also prove useful to you in this task, and of course you will need your sanding material.

, Make sure that the towel is damp. Check for any remaining grip tape residue as you wipe.








, Continue sanding any areas of inconsistency until the entire board is even.









When all the grip tape has been removed you can add your new grip tape to the board.

, An ideal environment for the task at hand can be in a garage, a shed, or even outdoors. Working in a selected location will ensure that cleanup is made easier as your efforts will leave behind sawdust and sand. 








Be mindful of there being a breeze. Avoid debris getting into your eyes or nose.

, This is a dirty job and you should dress appropriately. So, it is probably safe to say that you shouldn’t wear your best clothes while performing this task. It’ll save you a lot of laundry detergent and the angry rants of your spouse, girlfriend, or parent in the end. 








Wear old clothing that you wouldn’t mind becoming soiled or damaged.

, Did I say this was a dirty job? Keeping that in mind, it is important that you have cleanup materials at hand. This will only make your work that much easier and ensure that you can finish the job that much quicker.









Have a broom and dustpan readily available. There will be sawdust, scraps, and sand to clean up once you have finished.
A sheet of cardboard or a drop cloth can catch any falling debris and expedite your cleaning process.

, This can be the ground, a table, or any other comfortable space.

, Peeling off the old tape is simple, but it takes time. Using a hair dryer can help. Pull it slowly and carefully away from the deck. If you are too rough or hasty, the tape may rip and tear, making the job harder.

, Rid the deck of dust, dirt, rocks—anything that could ruin the tape's adhesive. You'll need it to be as clean as possible, so that your new griptape sticks to your skateboard longer.

, Many skate shops will put griptape onto your board for you, although it may be cheaper to do it yourself. At the very least, consider visiting a skate shop and asking for help if you are still unsure about the process.

Find unique camera angles.,
Don't leave the camera in one spot for too long.,
Be sure to do different tricks.,
Edit.,
Congrats!",How to Make a Simple Skateboarding Video," Invest in a quality camera that can capture movement well. Before filming your skate video, learn how to operate the camera. Important things to know include: How to turn it on/off, how to start/stop recording, and how to upload to your computer. If you are a shaky camera holder, or are making a video alone, consider using a tripod. They keep the camera steady and their heights are adjustable.;
, If you already know a handful of tricks, it will make your video a lot easier to make. Write down the order your tricks will be done throughout the video. Make sure you can do the tricks well, and they won't come out too sketchy. When you film yourself doing a trick, try to do the best you can on camera!

, Before filming, get warmed up so there won't be so much to edit out later., If you are alone, set up a camera stand filming the area you will be skating. Check to be sure you are completely in the view of the camera by doing a test trick, then reviewing the film., Have a few shots looking up from the ground, and others looking down upon you. Having interesting camera angles will add pizzazz to your video and make people want to keep watching it.

, Move the location of the camera to capture different angles and scenery. The coolest videos have clips with the camera really close to the skateboard., Or, have the skaters do these. This will add variety and interest to your skateboarding film.

If you are with a group of friends, have them ride near you and film you as well as you filming them.

, Half the fun of skateboarding is making those killer edits and posting them for the world to see. Unfortunately, it takes more than just a camera balanced on a stack of books, and the edits make the video really what it is. Once you have finished filming your entire movie, upload it to your computer. Your video will be a lot more captivating if there are special effects and music. Try to find music that fits the tricks being done. Finally, burn your video to a blank disc so it can be watched on a DVD player,or upload in on a video site like YouTube.


Make sure it is not too long. If you want save some clips for your next video!
Be sure to add music, it helps the video a lot.

, You have just made your first skate video. Show your friends, your sponsors, whomever you want to show off a little to. You deserve it!

If you don't have a skateboard tool, or it doesn't have a socket, use a crescent or socket wrench. Wheel nuts are usually ½” (13 mm), so use that size.Take the nuts off of all four wheels at once if you are changing all of the bearings. Set the nuts somewhere that you won’t lose them.
If you know for sure which wheel is the problem, only remove the nut and bearings from that wheel.;
, You will use the axle itself to pry the bearings out of the wheel, so don’t slide the wheel all the way off of the axle. Move the wheel toward the end of the axle so that only the bearing is still on the axle.If your skateboard tool has a bearing puller on it, feel free to use that to remove the bearings rather than the axle. If you want to use the bearing puller, take the wheel completely off of the axle.
Be sure not to lose any washers that are between the wheel and the axle.

, When the axle rod tip is just inside the bearing, use leverage to pry the wheel away from the skateboard truck. Place the heel of your hand on the bottom edge of the outside of the wheel. Place your fingers on top of the wheel and use leverage to pry the bearing out of the wheel.Think of the motion you’d use to open the tab on a pop can or pry a bottle cap from a glass bottle.
If you are putting new bearings in the wheels, then it doesn’t matter if you break the current ones. If you are going to clean the bearings and put them back in, be gentle when you are prying them out of the wheels.
If you are using a bearing puller, insert the tip into the bearing so it hooks the bearing’s edge and simply pull the bearing out of the wheel.

, Flip the wheel over and insert the tip of the axle rod into the second bearing. Repeat the prying process to remove the second bearing from the wheel. Set the bearings aside to be cleaned, or throw them away if you are putting new bearings in the wheels., Take a paper towel or old rag and dampen it with water. Wipe the bearing down, removing any visible debris from the bearing. If you didn’t notice any problem with the functioning of the bearings, a quick wipe might be sufficient cleaning., Use a small screwdriver, paper clip, or razor blade to pop the guards off. Slide the tool under the rubber guard and gently pry it off. Be careful not to slice the rubber guard or damage the rest of the bearing in the process.It’s not absolutely necessary to remove the guard, but you can clean the bearing more thoroughly if you do.
Some bearings have more than one guard that you must remove before exposing the bearing balls.

, Put the bearings into a glass jar, and fill it half-full with a bearing-specific solvent bought at your local skate shop. If you don’t have this, high-purity rubbing alcohol, carburetor cleaner, or lemon juice all work fairly well. Let the bearings sit for about 10 minutes, depending on how dirty they are.If your bearings are significantly rusty, it may be best to buy new ones rather than simply cleaning the ones you have. Cleaning and lubricating the bearings may be enough to get them functioning again.

, After the bearings soak in the fluid, swirl them around in the jar to further loosen any debris or buildup in the bearings. You may see lots of dirt that has already been removed, but a quick swirl helps finish off the cleaning. Swirl the jar for about one minute., Dump the cleaner out of the jar and lay the bearings out on a towel. One by one, wipe them with the towel and dry them as much as possible. Move the balls around in the track to dry all sides. You won’t get the bearings totally dry, but get them as dry as possible.


For a more complete drying, use a hair dryer or fan to evaporate all of the moisture.

, Before you put the rubber guards back on, lubricate the bearing balls. Cleaning is important, but without proper lubrication, the bearings still won’t work quite right. Use a few drops of lubricant from the skate shop, some motor oil, or speed cream used by barbers on electric razors.Most lubricants will work, and you only need a few drops. Don’t use WD40, as this will actually dry out and crack the bearings.

, After you’ve cleaned and lubricated the bearings, put all of the guards back on. Then put two bearings back into each wheel, eight in total if you removed all four wheels.

Center the griptape over your skateboard deck.,
Peel back a few inches of the paper guard and place it on one end of the board.,
Carefully smooth the entire grip onto the deck.,
Make sure that the grip is in line with the board.",How to Put Griptape on a Skateboard2," Start by lining up the tape with the board so that you know the correct length and won't have it stuck on crooked. It's difficult to correct mistakes once it sticks. Make sure the grip surface is longer and wider than your deck—you will cut the excess tape away when you are done. If you have a design on your grip, arrange where you want it to be.


Some people don't like the ""classic"" grip, and they go for different ways of gripping. For example: you can cut your grip in half before attaching it so that you have a line of grip-less space across your board, or you can draw a ""silhouette""and cut it out so that you have a icon on your board.
Imagine you have a grip tape that has a drawing/design on the center of it, and you don't want it to be in the center of your board. Just center the drawing where you want it to be (e.g. the nose or the tail). You'll probably have a part of your deck with no grip, but you'll also have a big extra piece of grip hanging off the other side. Cut this piece out and use it to fill the ""missing grip area"".

, Smooth out any small bubbles by pressing and pushing in the direction that you are lining the tape. If there are large bubbles that could eventually create a crease, you will want to pull back on the grip tape extremely carefully to remove these. Make sure that the adhesive doesn't stick to anything else.


Use two hands! This is a slow and patient process, and you don't want to rip the tape.

, Start slowly from one end of board and move your way across, pushing down on the tape so that you remove any air bubbles. Some brands already have small holes in their griptape to reduce the risk of air bubbles, but you should probably flatten the tape just to be safe. Flatten the griptape against the edges of the board.


You can always pull the grip tape up and try again. Try not to do this more than once or twice, or else the grip tape may lose its sticky backing.

, Make sure that the griptape covers the entire surface, unless you are leaving exposed wood in some areas for stylistic reasons. Some of the griptape may extend past the edges of the deck, but do not worry—you will trim this excess away with a knife or razor.

"
"
Scrape the sides.,
Use a knife or a box cutter to trim off any excess tape.,
Flatten out air bubbles.,
Poke holes to screw the trucks on.,
Neaten up the edges.,
Add any last-minute stylistic touches.",How to Put Griptape on a Skateboard3," You'll notice that you have ""extra"" grip on the edges of the deck. Grab a screwdriver, a metal file, or another blunt object, and scrape it around the sides of the board until the griptape develops a white edge. This is a way of sealing the edges of your griptape. If you do this correctly, you'll have a white outline of your deck on your grip—this outline marks out the area where you should cut away the excess grip tape on the side of your skateboard.


Make sure to use long strokes instead of short, aggressive ones—otherwise, you might tear up the sides. Also be careful not to file off the polish on the edge of your board.

, Most boards have curved edges from sanding, so you want to trim the tape past the curve along the edge. Make long and steady cut motions for the best result. Remember to hold the blade in a slight angle towards the edge of the skateboard so you don't get a small line of grip sticking out. Use the outline of your grip for reference: you need to cut along the sides of the deck, and around the nose and tail of the board.


Make sure to keep all fingers out of the way at all times, as the razor blade can easily slip from the material.
Use two hands to make it easier. You do not want it to accidentally dig into the deck of your board!

, Once the board is completely taped, inspect it for small air bubbles. Use a knife or a razor blade to make small incisions into the grip tape; this should release any bulging air bubbles. Smooth over the incision so that the grip tape sticks smoothly to the deck.

, If you don't yet have trucks on your board, use a screwdriver to poke eight holes in the griptape where the screws for the trucks will go. If you already have trucks on your board, you can wait to poke these holes until you replace the trucks, or you can poke the holes as follows:


Take a second deck of the same size with no trucks on and use it as a ""guide"" for where to poke the holes. Mark the spots with a pencil or poke a small hole. You can now use a razor blade to cut a hole around the screw, big enough to unscrew the trucks. Unscrew each one and put them back so it looks ""cleaner"".
If you don't have a second board, try to guess where the holes go. Try ""following"" the screws and poking using a needle. If you poke the center of the deck, the needle won't go far; if you poke the screw, if will go further and you will know where the hole must go.

, Your first attempt might look a little butchered, so go around and trim up the ridges. Run the Stanley knife, box cutter, or razor blade around the outer edge of your skateboard to remove any extra scraps. Most of the imperfections will not be too noticeable as the deck wears over time. Take a small piece of extra grip or sandpaper and lightly rub the edges where the grip sticks to the board. This may prevent the grip from peeling off the board later.

, While you have the knife out, you can cut a little triangle (or another shape) between the screw-holes on one end of the board. Some skaters do this to more easily identify the nose or tail of their board. Cut out a circle or a hexagon to give your board some special looks and give it interesting riding characteristics. If you want you can use paint markers or colored sharpies to draw designs or patterns on the grip tape. Be creative!

The necessary items are listed below under Things You'll Need. In particular you'll need pliers/screwdriver, a socket wrench or ratchet and a skate tool (or T-tool).;
, You can do this easily by using a socket wrench, ratchet or skate tool to loosen the nuts holding the wheels in place. You may need to hold your board steady and apply firm pressure to break the bolts loose.

, It's easy to lose or misplace a necessary nut, washer, or some other part when you're working on your board. To prevent this, consider putting the parts you're not working with inside a plastic bag.


For each wheel removed, you should have a bolt and one to two bearing washers.

, The bearing will occupy the core of the wheel and will be circular in shape. After removing the wheels, you can gently pry out the bearings with a screwdriver, or pull these out carefully with needle-nose pliers.


If you don't have a tool available, put the wheel on the truck like you're attaching it, but make sure only one bearing (out of the two for that wheel) goes on the truck. Then wedge the bearing out, using the truck for leverage.Some boards have an additional spacer between bearings called a speed ring. You should remove this after freeing the first bearing.
If you don't have a bearing puller, you can use a thick metal rod (thin enough to fit through the opening of the bearing where the axle usually goes through), touch the bearing on the opposite side when inserted the metal rod, and gently tap the rod with a hammer. However, doing this may damage the bearings, so you must be very careful.

, Be sure to do so gently, to avoid grinding dirt into the bearings. Gently rub the bearings with a dry rag or paper tower to eliminate all obvious dirt.


If the grime is especially bad, apply a moderate amount of solvent to the rag or paper towel, to help cut through the gunk.

, Using a clean bucket or bowl, fill it with the acetone or a grease cleaning solvent. Mineral spirits or rubbing alcohol work well, are relatively inexpensive, and are less harsh than some cleaners. Fill the bucket or bowl just enough to submerge the bearings.


If you decide to use acetone, please remember to wear gloves, as this solvent is quite strong.Note that not every boarder recommends the use of acetone, and you may choose to use a milder solvent instead. Wear gloves when handling acetone!
If you use a milder solvent, like mineral spirits, you may have to wait a little longer for the bearings to become fully clean.

, Take the bearings in hand and using a small, thin object, like pin, paperclip, or the point of an X-acto knife, pry the rubber shield from the bearing. These caps are usually black or red.After removing the cap, you should see tiny metal balls.


If you have difficulty doing this, try to insert the pointed object between the rubber cap and bearing housing, then gently pry until the cap comes free.

, Now the bearings are ready to be put in the cleaning solution. Swirl the bearings around in the solvent for about five minutes, then let the bearings sit in the liquid for about ten minutes.If the grease solvent has considerably darkened, you may need to carefully drain the solvent and add some more to the bucket. Do this as many times as necessary until the bearings look clean.

, Before removing the bearings, prepare a level, safe place where these can dry. Lay down paper towel or a rag, remove the bearings, and allow enough time to pass until completely dry.

, Let the bearings dry for about 10 minutes. You can speed this process by using canned air to spin the bearing. Aim the canned air into the open side of the bearing and spray.If it doesn't move, use your finger to spin the bearing and spray the air while the bearing is already spinning.

, It is best to use lubricant specifically intended for skateboard bearings. You should only need two or three drops of lubricant in each bearing. After applying the lubricant, spin the bearing to distribute throughout the bearing.Do not use: Cooking oil, motor oil, or anything that might gunk up the bearings or create stickiness. WD-40 is also not recommended, as it lasts a short time, junks up the bearings, and can dry bearings out, counteracting the lubricant.

, The shields should pop into place without much difficulty, but take care to make sure the seal between the bearing shield and bearing is complete. Check to ensure that there are no gaps.

, Replace the bearings into the wheels by pushing each firmly with your finger into the wheel as far as you are able. Drive the bearings home by pushing the wheel down onto a skateboard truck as hard as you can.


If your board came equipped with the bearing spacer (speed ring), do not forget to put this between bearings just as you found it.

, Now that the bearings are in the wheels as far as possible, reattach the wheels back to the trucks. Remember to put one washer on each side of the wheel. Then tighten the bolt until the wheels are firm, but not stiff.


The wheels should jiggle slightly after reattaching.

, Tightening a nut too much can hamper the wheel's ability to spin. Test each wheel by hand, spinning each to make sure every one moves freely.


If a wheel doesn't spin or is hard to spin, loosen the bolt that holds the wheel on the truck slightly.

Remove the old wheels using a combination wrench.,
Remove the bearings by prying them out of the wheel.,
Return your bearings to the axle.,
Put on your new wheels.,
Tighten the nut on top of the new wheel.,
Recognize when you need new wheels.,
Read the box when buying wheels.,
Remember some skateboard vocabulary before shopping.",How to Choose Skateboard Wheels," This is dependent on the type of skateboarding that you do. There are different needs for street, sidewalk and skate park boarding, and you should try out a few wheels at your local skate shop to see what you like within those categories.


Think about where you skate, how often you skate, and if you prefer doing tricks or cruising around town.
Bigger or heavier riders usually prefer slightly bigger wheels.
While some skaters contend that different dyes change wheel properties, your color choice is almost completely cosmetic.;
, Today, all wheels are made from polyurethane, and higher a durometer number means that the wheel is made of a harder plastic. For example, a 95A wheel is much harder than an 80A one. Though rare, some companies produce ""B"" scale wheels. A B wheel is 20 points harder than it's ""A"" counterpart: thus an 80B wheel is as hard as a 100A wheel.
If you skate a bit of everything, consider getting a wheel around 90A-97A.
Soft wheels (75A-85A) absorb the impact of pebbles, sticks, and cracks for better cruising on roads.
Hard wheels (95A+) have more pop for jumps, grinds, and tricks.

, Always measured in millimeters, the diameter of a wheel is anywhere between 50mm for street boards to 75mm for longboards. Larger wheels cover more ground per rotation, and are thus faster. Small wheels sit lower to the ground are are less heavy.


Few companies list the width of a wheel, but in general wider wheels provide more balance, speed, and a smoother ride.
A good all-purpose wheel is anywhere from 52-60 mm.
Remember that the larger the wheel, the faster you'll go.

, For technical skating and tricks, you want responsive wheels that are easy to get off the ground. This prevents your wheels from catching on lips or grinds and makes it easy to perform ollies and flip-tricks.



Durometer -- 97A and above

Diameter-- 48-52mm
Note: Super small (48mm) and super hard (101A, 85B) wheels require good technique to handle, and are generally for experienced or professional riders.

, On ramps and half-pipes you'll want a lot of speed but don't have to worry about hitting sticks or pebbles. Harder wheels will give you good control for tricks and mobility.



Durometer -- 90A-97A

Diameter-- 55-60mm
Note: You can get bigger wheels to get more speed once you get comfortable.

, Bigger wheels are faster, and soft wheels absorb vibrations that make your ride uncomfortable or difficult. Most larger wheels are also wider as well, giving you increased stability.



Durometer--75A-85A, and 78A is generally considered standard.

Diameter-- 64-75mm , A good ""starter wheel"" is usually 52-55mm, 99A -- well balanced for most terrains. Most wheels today say what they are designed for on the package, so make sure you read the box. , Place the skateboard on it's side, then loosen the nut in the center of the wheel until it comes off.


Make sure your wrench fits snugly on the nut to avoid damaging it.

, Lodging a screwdriver or other long metal tool in the center of the bearing, slowly add downward force to the bearing until it slides out.


Depending on how old they are, the bearings may not come out immediately.
If your wheels have been spinning poorly or making noise, you may need new bearings.

, Slide the bearings back on the axle the way they came off. If they are dirty or sticky, use a rag to clean them off before moving on.

, Push them so that the bearings slides smoothly into the center of the wheel.

, You want to tighten the nut just enough so that the wheel has a little ""play,"" meaning it can wiggle back and forth a small amount. Tighten the rest of the nuts over you new wheels, and you're ready to start skating again.

, Skateboard wheels wear out differently depending on how often and where you ride them, but they generally need to be replaced every three to four months with regular use. If you do a lot of bumpy street riding or are a heavier rider you may need to replace your wheels more frequently. Some signs you need new wheels are:


Wheel diameter decreasing
Uneven or flat spots while riding
Slow or bumpy riding
Loose or noisy wheel bearings , Despite some confusing lingo and competing number systems, skateboard wheels are generally easy to pick out. Why? Because manufacturers have started developing wheels for various scenarios, and they almost always list their purpose on the side of the box. If you unsure, see if the box contains any ""suggested"" uses for the wheels before buying.

, Skateboard terminology, especially when it comes to building a board, can get complicated. To buy new wheels, however, you only need to know a few key words:



Bearings: These sit inside your wheels and allow it to spin around the axle. They are sold separately and you can reuse old bearings with new wheels.

Durometer: A rating system that determines a wheel's hardness.

Street Skating: a style of skateboarding that emphasizes tricks and short jumps in city environments.

Vert Skating: boarding in a specially designed skatepark with large ramps and half-pipes, and features for tricks.

Longboards: extra long, extra wide boards meant for commuting and going down hills.

Keep all your parts organized.,

Attach your wheels.,
Make sure that your grip tape and screws are even.,
Test your trucks.,
Stand on your board and test it.",How to Assemble a Skateboard," You will have a lot of small hardware that comes in your skateboard kit. It’s best to keep everything organized so you don’t lose any parts or hardware.


You may want to keep your parts in the box or original packaging until each one is needed.;
, To best apply the grip tape to your deck you want to have it laying flat on an open surface. This will allow you evenly lay the grip tape over your deck.


You want the nose and tail ends of your board to be pointing up with the graphic on the bottom of the deck facing your flat surface.

, Your grip tape will be a rectangular sheet that covers a larger area than your board. This allows you a little wiggle room if you don’t place the tape exactly square. Peel the back paper off from the back of your grip tape, like a sticker. Lay the grip over the top of the deck as evenly as possible.


Be careful to touch as little of the adhesive side of grip tape as possible.
Pinch the ends of tape between your forefinger and thumb. Pulling the ends of the tape taut, find the edges of your deck with your middle finger and let the grip fall flat onto the deck. If you have a piece of grip tape that has a cutout or graphic that is supposed to be on one end of your board, you can identify the nose and tail ends. The tail typically has a steeper incline whereas the nose has a more narrow curve.

, Press down hard to remove any air bubbles. Start at the center of your deck and gradually move outward toward the nose and tail.


Do your best to make sure there are no air bubbles, as these will dramatically reduce the amount of time the grip tape remains adhesive on the board. Air bubbles also allow small rocks to get between your grip and the deck which can be uncomfortable while riding.
Take a screwdriver and rub it along the edge of the board to make an outline. You will see a white guideline for cutting.

, Cut around the edge with a sharp blade, preferably a razor or box cutter. It’s easiest to start in the center of your deck rather than on one of the edges.


Make an incision which is perpendicular to your deck. This will make it easier to start cutting and get a consistent cut around your deck.
Angle your razor over the top of your deck to help the process. Pull the outer portion of your tape to make the cutting easier.

, Take a portion of the tape that was cut away and, like with sandpaper, rub the edges of your grip tape.


By sanding the edges you are smoothing out any rough or lifted portions that could peel up.

, Take a screwdriver or Allen wrench and poke holes through the grip tape. Poke your holes downward so that the grip tape doesn’t crack and your hardware can screw in over the grip. Then place your screws through the holes in the deck. Once your screws are in place, attach your trucks onto your board. Attach one truck at a time. Some hardware kits come with multiple colored screws. These different colored screws help you to differentiate the nose from the tail when riding. You can place these screws at either end. Just remember which end you place the screws.
Use your fingers or the palm of one hand to hold the hardware in place while you attach the trucks. The baseplate is the flat square portion of your truck that connects to your deck. The hanger, the “T” shaped part of your trucks will be facing down. Screw the nuts on over the trucks using your skate tool or socket wrench. You can also use a screwdriver to tighten the heads of the screws.
Make sure that the kingpins on both trucks, the portion of your trucks with the large nut and rubber bushings, are facing each other. Otherwise, your board won’t ride properly.

, If you don’t have a bearing press, you can insert your bearings using your trucks. Remove the nut and washer from the axle of your truck so you can slide the bearing and wheel on. Most bearings have a flat side and a ridged side. Slide the bearing down onto the axle so the flat side is facing up. Press your wheel down over the bearing until you feel the bearing slide into the center of your wheel. Take the wheel off the axle, slide another bearing down and repeat with the other side of the wheel. Each wheel has two bearings.


Do this for all four wheels.
You may hear a popping sound when you press the wheel onto the bearing. This sound indicates that the bearing is fully in.

, Some wheels have an outside and inside edge. If this is the case, the outside will be the side with the graphic. Some wheels, however, will have graphics on both sides and it doesn't matter which way the wheel goes on the truck. Slide the wheel down onto the axle and then place the washer and nut over the wheel. With your skate tool or wrench, tighten the nut as far as it will go. By tightening the nut all the way you will ensure that your bearings are fully in place. Then loosen the nut enough so that your wheel can spin freely. Loosen the nut just a few turns to keep it secure while giving your wheel enough space to move.
Grab your wheel and tug on it. It should move back and forth on the axle slightly.
Make sure that your wheel is also level. If it lays at an angle, your bearings are not fully in.

, The heads of your screws should be flush with your grip tape. If your screw heads are sticking out, then it will make it harder to perform tricks and maneuver.


If your screws aren’t flush, screw each one further down. Don’t go too far so as to risk cracking the wood of the deck.

, Make sure that your trucks are firmly secured to your deck. The baseplate portion of your trucks which is attached to the deck shouldn’t move at all.


If your trucks are loose then you will have a much harder time riding your board, and it could be dangerous.

, Rock back and forth and skate around. Test the tightness of your trucks and make sure that your wheels can spin freely.


If the board feels wobbly, tighten the nut on the kingpin clockwise about half a turn for each truck.
If your trucks are too tight, you may have trouble turning or carving. Turn the nut of your kingpin counterclockwise. Make sure that you rotate the nuts of each truck evenly.
If you can’t coast for very long or feel resistance when pushing, loosen your wheels some more.

Decide what you're going to purchase.,
Decide whether you want a longboard, a classic or a street/vert board.,
Be sure to purchase from a reputable source.,
How much money do you want to spend on a skateboard deck?,
Buy a quality deck.,
The trucks are the second most important part of a skateboard.,
Pick out wheels for the kind of skateboard that you have and what you mostly want to be doing.,
Bearings are very important if you want to keep rolling without pushing constantly, especially while street skating.",How to Choose a Good Skateboard," If you want a good board for less money, you're going to want a complete. If you want a much better board for more money, you're going to want to custom make yours.


Keep in mind that choosing custom parts can actually save you money. If you're buying on a budget, get a Mini Logo or blank deck, cheap all-around wheels like Bones 100s, cheap bearings like Spitfire Cheap shots or Bones Reds, and any trucks that you can afford.;
,


Longboards can cost from $60-$500. They're good for bombing hills and riding smoothly, but very hard and limiting for tricks. They are great for beginners wanting to learn to skate.
Classics can cost from $60-$400. A classic, cruiser, or mini cruiser is good for cruising.
Street/verts can cost from $70-$200. They're the typical ""skateboard"", mostly made for tricks but good for a little bit of everything depending on the wheels.

, Buying online might save you a few dollars, but try your local skate shop first. The few extra dollars you spend support the shop and your local skate community. Developing a good relationship with a local skate shop often saves you money in the long run. The completes are not as good as custom made, but you can get them for a lot less money and upgrade any bad components later.


A complete can cost anywhere from $50-$200 (USD).
A custom made can cost anywhere from $90-$500 (USD).

, Blank decks, decks with no graphics on the bottom, usually run a lot cheaper than pro decks and ride just as well. But if you fancy having your favorite pro skateboarder's deck and you have enough money, go right ahead.

, Decks available at your local department store are usually of low quality and have pictures of cartoon characters on the bottom. If you want an entire board, but don't know exactly what you want, buy a complete skateboard from a company or go to a skate shop and ask the employee about the products. If you want to ride on the streets, get a 7.5 to 8.0 deck, if you want to ride vert, 8.0 and up is probably best. However, it's all personal preference. People street skate all the time with decks over 8.0.


Another tip to keep in mind while choosing a board width is how tall you are and also what kind of style you wish to skate. Most technical skaters (the ones who incorporate advanced flip tricks... like Rodney Mullen) tend to favor boards between 7.5 and 7.75 regardless of how tall or small they happen to be. The upper hand of having a thin board allows for quick rotation. The other side of the spectrum is the ""go big"" skaters (Jamie Thomas is a classic example of a ""go big"" guy). Most ""go big"" guys favor size 8.0 and up. The advantage of a wide heavy board feels more stable under your feet while in mid air and while landing (especially those who have big feet). If your a kid you might want to just stick with a 7.66 or smaller.

, When purchasing a truck, you want to look for these characteristics.


A length that is no more 10 inches (25.4 cm).






A width that fits the deck, so 7.5 trucks on a 7.5 deck.






A design that you like.
Lightweight.

Grinds well.
Durable material - You don't want them to snap in half.
Pick out a truck that has no design or paint if you are on a tight budget.
Design isn't everything - it might look cool, but that doesn't mean it's good quality.

, They're typically rated with the ABEC (Annular Bearing Engineering Committee) scale. The ABEC scale only measures the precision of the bearing, not how well it rolls or how long it lasts. It's a common misconception that the ABEC scale refers to how fast the bearing rolls. Anything above 1 is precision and will perform fine for skateboarding, but it's recommended to go above a 3.


The ABEC ratings for skateboard bearings are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
If you keep your bearings clean and well lubricated, they'll last for much longer.
If you have the money for them, bearings with ceramic balls instead of steel ones will last longer and won't need to be lubricated as often. Ceramic balls also won't absorb as much heat as steel balls, which helps performance when they get hot from friction at high speeds.

Get a basic idea what kind of board you want and what kind of riding you'll be doing.,
Know where to look.,
Plan a route.,
Pick the best board.,
Good starter board brands include: Mongoose, Blind, World Industries, Birdhouse.",How to Find the Right Skateboard," If you have never stepped on a board before, you might want to research on the web what you want. For beginners,consider bigger softer wheels and a wider deck for more stability and less getting stuck on cracks. If you are more experienced, you might want smaller harder wheels and thinner deck (for easier flipping)and more concave if you starting tricks and are comfortable with riding.;
, If it was your friend who convinced you to get a skateboard ask him/her where he/she got his/hers (There is a lot of his/her stuff available). If you are just beginning skateboarding you probably want a lower priced medium-quality board. The best places to look for these kind boards are probably places like Target, sporting shops, and maybe Toys r us and Walmart. If more experienced consider local skate shops.

, Try going on a skateboard looking day one day and have your parents drive you to different stores in a day or two. Compare prices, quality, designs, and how awesome they are to you with other stores. Remember, don't be in a rush to buy a board. Take your time. You don't have to buy a board on that day. Be patient. Better wait a week and get an awesome board then hurry and get a terrible board.

, Try spinning the wheel. If won't even budge maybe try a different one. But remember the wheels can still roll when you stand on it. Make sure the board has concave ( the curves on top of a board )unless you like it flat so much enough to sacrifice tricks (almost impossible to do tricks when flat).Make sure the wheels are even with the board so when you put the skateboard on its side the top is even with the wheels. Check how grippy the griptape is (black thing on top). Also you are good with the design, right? Don't feel obliged to buy the best wheel spinner board if you don't like the design. If you like a design on a different board its still probably okay if its over the $10 mark ( complete boards should cost from $35 to $85 US dollars. custom around $120). make sure you DO NOT buy the 'extra safe' boards or the 'safety first' boards etc etc etc you get my point. They are absolutely the worst. They are flat, terrible grip, bad wheels, horrible turning. The only way it is safe is because you probably won't even make it out your garage with that kind of board. They are inviting though because they usually have the best graphics.

, For experienced the best would probably be Element,Plan B, Flip, Darkstar, Zoo York, Zero and many more.

Test out your new board.",How to Build a Longboard," You will need:


Plywood or hardwood to build your deck; 2-3
Wood glue or another strong adhesive
Rough and fine-grained sandpaper
8 small screws to attach the trucks to the deck—four for each truck. The screws should be long enough to fasten the trucks securely to the board, but not long enough that they get in the way. Match the width to the size of the holes in your trucks.
Screws or a staple-gun to help seal the board when you shape its curve. The amount of screws/staples will vary greatly depending on the size of your board and the quality of your pressing mechanism—screws may not be necessary if you use a board press, but they will make your deck much tighter if you are molding it with basic weights or clamps.
A drill
Weights
A jig saw to cut out the deck
Polyurethane varnish or fiberglass resin, hardener, and cloth
A large piece of paper and a pencil for drawing out your board design.
Grip tape (to make it easier for your feet to stick to the top of the board);
, For a cheap board, use 2-3 1/4-inch-thick plywood sheets or 4-6 1/8-inch sheets. Alternately, use 7-9 plies, each about one mm thick. You will use screws or wood glue to fuse these pieces of wood together into a longboard deck. The amount of sheets that you use depends upon how much flex you want: the more layers of wood, the more rigid your board will be. You can also buy a pre-pressed deck and build your longboard out from there.If you have the time or money to do so, try to find high-quality wood. Bamboo, Birch, White Ash, and Maple are popular choices, and each offers a different ride. Bamboo will be the strongest of the three.
Each piece of wood should be 10 inches wide by 40 inches long, or longer if you want a longer board. You should have a basic idea of the shape of board you want before you start to build one. Remember, however, that you can always cut a piece of wood down to size.
Do not go to the lumberyard at a hardware or home-and-garden store: this wood is usually dry, and thus better for construction than riding. An actual lumberyard would work best. Realistically, you can use almost any hardwood—even salvaged pieces of flooring., Find a good, flexible wood glue, or epoxy and resin. You can find these products at most construction or hardware stores. The adhesive functions to keep the layers of plywood together, so if you have cheap wood glue, you will have a cheap board.

, Trucks are the metal bits that attach the wheels to the board and allow the longboard to turn when you lean. The right trucks are important to a longboard's feel. You will most likely want Reverse Kingpin Trucks, unless the board has a tail and you are planning to ollie it. Standard Kingpin provides better pop, while Reverse get better stability and turn response.


Some longboard trucks have Double Kingpins, which allow for a tighter carve, but sacrifice some stability.

, The harder the wheel, the more it will slide. If you want to go sideways, get one with a higher (harder) durometer. A good slide wheel will usually be above 80a durometer. Softer wheels will be more grippy, and better for sticking tight turns.

, Bearings fit inside the wheels and enable them to turn smoothly. These range quite a bit in price, depending on the quality you are looking for. Ceramic bearings are nice, but they usually cost well over a hundred dollars. A suitable set of steel bearings can cost as little as $20. For instance, check out Bones Reds or Seismic Tektons for a good entry-level bearing.

, Cut the wood into strips that are about 10 inches wide by 40 inches long—slightly longer than you want your board to be. Leave longer strips for a longer board, or shorter strips for a shorter board. Don't worry about shaping the board: you just need rectangular strips of plywood for now. You will carve out the shape of your board once you press the pieces together into a solid deck.







, On paper, draw a straight line that is as long as you want your board to be. This line will be the center of your board. Now draw the shape of your board as it will flare from this line. If you want your board to be symmetrical, only draw one half of the deck, then use the same outline to carve out both sides. Consider how you want to use your longboard: longer boards (40-60+ inches) tend to be better for building speed on long-distance straightaways; shorter boards are more portable and may be better for quick, sharp turns; cruising boards tend to be wider, and carving boards tend to be more streamlined.


If this is your first board, keep things simple. Draw a slight curve at the front and try to keep it nice and wide, since you will be steering at this end. The widest part of the board should be about 1/3 of the way down from the nose.

, You will press the wood together with pressure and adhesive, let the pressed wood dry, and then carve this shape out. Trace carefully, and make sure to draw the deck exactly as you want it. Look out for imperfections in the wood, and make sure that each half of the board is symmetrical—unless you'd like it otherwise., You will drill screws through these holes to help clamp the wood together, so try to make the holes slightly smaller than your screws. Again, the amount of screws (and, thus, holes) will vary greatly depending on the size of your board, so there is no set number that you must use. Try to space the screw points evenly around the board shape, and consider which points on your design might require extra support to seal—parts of the board that flare/jut out, for instance, or that dip sharply in toward the center.


Keep your pieces of plywood or hardwood evenly stacked, and hold them in place so that they do not shift. Drill holes straight through the wood, and make sure not to drill through the area that will become your deck. Drill the holes about one inch from the outline of the board.
Consider waiting to drill the holes until the wood is clamped. Drill the screws directly into the wood, and be careful not to drill into the deck shape.

, Mix your adhesive, then use a paintbrush to spread a thick layer of adhesive on the inner-facing side of each piece of wood. Then, carefully put them back together.Make sure that your pre-drilled holes are still on top.


Make sure to protect the floor. The pressure will push glue out of the pre-drilled holes and the edges of the wood, and you don't want to spill glue on the floor.

, Stack your plywood pieces so that a clean, smooth side of one piece (which will eventually become the top surface of the longboard) is on the bottom. Arrange the wood so that the ends of the board are each resting on something, and the middle is hanging free., Lay weights onto the stack of wood, right around the widest part of the board. You want your eventual board to bend slightly upwards in the middle, so that when you stand on it, it flattens out. This procedure is more of an art than anything else, so put weight on it until you like the result. Make a light curve for best results. Leave the board beneath the weights until the curve is well set into the wood.Consider using strong clamps instead of weights. Clamp the center of the board so that it sinks below the front and back tips of the deck.

, Then put the weights back on top or re-clamp the deck. if you are happy with the curve, put screws in all around the board. Keep the part between the lines free of adhesive.

, When you are sure, wait for the adhesive to set, following the directions on the bottle.

,, The press is much more expensive than simple adhesive, but it may be a wise investment if you plan to make multiple boards. The two main types of board press are the coffin press and the vacuum press.Coffin press: A coffin press is two 2x4s running along the edges of a sheet of plywood, along with another 2x4 running along the middle of another sheet of plywood. The sheets of plywood are then connected via screws and nuts with the 2x4s facing inward. The board (all of your layers glued together) is placed on the two 2x4s. Then place the top of the coffin press on top of the board, screw it down to the amount of concave you want, wait about 24 hours for the glue to dry, cut out your shape, and you've got a deck!
Vacuum press: When you put the plies in, they are already cut into shape and glued. The vacuum press sucks all the air out while pressing the plies into a mold that you can use. Wait 24 hours with your plies in the press, and you have a deck. You can buy a vacuum press online.

, Grab one of your pieces of plywood, and find the smoothest, best-looking side. This is going to be the bottom of the board.









Measure from the sides to find the exact center of the board. Draw a line lengthwise down the center of the board—from the front to the back.
Trace along the edges of your template. Hold your template in place with your hand, a clamp, or a weight.
Flip the board over and repeat for the other side.
Your design is now on your board. Take your stencil off of the plywood and make sure that you like the shape.

, Make sure that the board is smooth and free of scratches.

, Either coating will protect your paint from scratches. Look around at hardware stores and skate shops to compare prices and see what's available in your area.


If you are using fiberglass resin: First, mix the fiberglass resin with the hardener at the correct proportion. Then lay out the fiberglass cloth on the painted side; using a paintbrush, spread the resin evenly across the board. Be sure to work quickly and effectively, because the fiberglass begins to harden in about 15 minutes. After it is applied, let it cure for about 3-4 hours.
If you are using polyurethane varnish: Spread the varnish evenly across the board with a paintbrush. Make sure that the coat is smooth. When you're done, let the varnish dry for 3-4 hours before you proceed with your board-building.

, Now, you can add whatever sort of design you like, with paint or waterproof markers.








, You can leave your deck plain with its natural wood, but painting or otherwise decorating the board is a great way to make it unique. Use electrical tape or a stencil to mark out your design. Paint the bottom of your deck.


Use spray paint. Cut out a stencil from paper or cardboard, choose your colors, and spray-paint the design onto the smooth bottom of your board. Allow the paint time to dry before you touch or ride the board.
Use regular acrylic paint. Sketch out a design and paint between the lines; paint whatever you like. Allow 20-60 minutes for the paint to dry after you decorate the board.
Use wood stain to paint. To create a pattern with a few different shades, use three coats for the dark parts and one coat for the lighter parts. After the stain dries, remove the tape.
Use permanent markers. Your design may be less colorful and more fragile than if you used paint, but you may find that markers give you greater control when you are drawing on your board.

, This will seal your design onto the bottom of the board. The varnish or resin should be clear, so your design should still be visible through the protective coating.

, Buy a chunk of bulk grip tape that will cover your whole board. The tape will help your feet stick to the board at high speeds. Apply it carefully to the deck, just like a large sticker. Remove excess tape with a razor blade or box cutter. The design is up to you:









Cover the entire surface with grip tape. This is the simplest method, and it will look like a standard longboard top.
Cut up pieces and create designs out of grip tape. Make sure that you cover enough of the board surface that your feet can easily grip. In general, your pattern should contain more grip tape than empty wood space.
Paint your board and apply clear grip tape over the top to display your design. The clear grip tape may be somewhat opaque, but the colors and general idea of your design should shine through.

, Use surfboard wax on the surface of your longboard if you plan to ride it barefoot most of the time. Bear in mind that you will need reapply wax, as it wears off with use.

, To do this, take a bearing, and push it down into each wheel. You can't push it too far; there will be a little barrier for it to sit against. Put a bearing inside each of the four wheels.

, Just slide the wheel/bearing assembly onto the truck, with the concave portion of your wheels (if they are concave) facing outwards. Secure these onto the trucks with the nuts provided. The nuts should be tight enough that they allow for easy and free spinning of the wheels, but not so tight that they come off while skating.

, Be sure that they are straight, or else the trucks will not align correctly.








, You will need the truck spacers and the trucks to do this. Place the spacer between the truck and the deck. When orientating your trucks, make sure that the tightening bolt faces towards the nose of the board in the front, and that the loosening bolt faces towards the tail of the board in the back. Arranging them to face opposite directions ensures that you can turn in the right direction when you lean. Tighten the truck and spacers on to the deck with 4 bolts to each assembly.

, When you have attached your bearings, wheels, and trucks to the deck, your board should be ready to skate. Stand on the board to make sure that it holds your weight. If it does not break from your weight, try riding it down the sidewalk. Make sure that you have double-checked the integrity of every piece of your board—bearings, wheels, trucks, deck—before you ride it around on streets or busy walkways.

Reattach the wheels.",How to Clean a Penny Board," Use a socket wrench with a 13mm socket to remove the nuts that hold each wheel to its truck. Between each nut and wheel will be a small washer. Another washer will be between the wheel and the body of the truck. Take care not to lose these small partsSkate tools will usually feature a 13mm socket, as well as the other sizes you will need to disassemble a penny board.;
, In order to keep track of the nuts, spacers, and bolts that hold your penny board together, place them in some sort of receptacle as you disassemble the board. A resealable plastic bag or cup will work.It’s worth using several different receptacles to hold different sets of small pieces.
For instance, keep the pieces that go with the bearing and wheel washers in one cup, and the pieces of the trucks in another cup.

, To get the bearings out of the wheels, insert an arm of the axle about 1 cm (.5 in) into one side of a wheel at an angle. Lever the wheel and truck apart from one another to pry the bearing out. Repeat this process on the other side of the wheel. Knock the wheel against your work surface to remove the cylindrical spacer from the wheel if it doesn't fall out.Take care to position the end of the truck axle against the outside edge of the bearing. You want to avoid damaging the bearing itself.

, Start by removing the axle from the truck housing. Use a 14mm socket to remove the single kingpin that holds each truck together. Beneath the kingpin will be two washers and a rubber bushing, and beneath the truck there will be another bushing and another washer.To remove the truck housing from the deck, use a phillips screwdriver to unscrew the bolts from the top of the deck. There are four bolts for each truck. You may need a wrench to hold the nut on the underside of the bolt.

, Cosmetic issues on the deck can often be removed with abrasion. While fine grit sandpaper is best, you may be able to use a key to gently and evenly scrape off unsightly scratches in the deck’s plastic.Use a damp, soapy cloth to scrub the deck clean.

, Place dirty bearings in an empty bottle and pour in enough rubbing alcohol to submerge them. An empty pill bottle works especially well, as you’ll only need to use a bit of rubbing alcohol to submerge the bearings. Do one wheel’s worth of bearings at a time. Swish the bottle around gently for a minute with the bearing inside.Wipe the bearings dry with paper towel after allowing them to sit for a few minutes.
If your bearings aren’t visibly dirty, simply wipe them with a clean cloth.
If bearings cannot be cleaned with rubbing alcohol and/or wiping, replace them. They can be purchased from the penny board website.

, Place the wheels in a plastic container with soap and warm water. A mild, environmentally friendly soap will be plenty strong enough. Use your fingers to scrub dirt or grime from each of the wheels, one at a time.After scrubbing with soapy water, rinse them with clean water to remove soap residue and dry each wheel with a cloth or clean paper towel.
Do not use an antibacterial soap.

, The pieces of the truck as well as the various spacers and washers can simply be wiped with a clean cloth or paper towel.Pay particular attention to wiping down the parts of the truck that fit within the truck housing, and the parts of the housing that hold that touch the truck. These include the small black plastic cup, the kingpin, and the rounded nub of the truck.

, Reassembly will be simple after taking apart the board to clean it. The most important part is placing the correct washers and bushings on either side of the truck. You will be able to tell which is correct by sight, but make sure you’ve selected the right one each time.From the truck housing, the order of reassembly for each truck is: bottom washer, bottom bushing, truck, top bushing, top washer, and bolt.

, Position the board on its side and slide a bearing with the outside edge down onto the truck bolt. Slide the wheel onto the bolt as well, and press it onto the bearing until you hear a pop.Then remove the wheel, insert a spacer into the other side, and repeat the process with another bearing on the other side of the wheel.

, Make sure the edge of the bearings are flush with the wheels' surfaces before reattaching. The order for reattachment of a wheel to a truck is: washer, wheel, washer, 13mm nut. After tightening, check to see if the wheel spins freely. If not, loosen the nut until it does."

Gather all your tools and towels and other items.,
Remove the grimy old wheels.,
After you have the wheels off, you'll need to get to the bearings.,
Once all of the bearings are out, fill a dish with olive, sunflower, or canola oil and drop them in to soak for a little while.,
Now that the bearings are lubed up, clean all the dirt and sand off them.,
Start the reassembly.,
Before you screw the wheels back on, if you have washers to put on the outside and inside, do that now.,
So your skateboard is all back together.,
Make sure you check your hardware screws too.,
Ride off into the sunset!",How to Spring Clean Your Skateboard," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need.;
, The biggest part to a smooth running skateboard is clean, functional bearings, so grab your wrench, and unscrew the bolts.

, There are a couple ways to get the bearings out of the wheels, but they're all pretty similar. Make the skateboard work for you – use the tip of the trucks, and carefully but firmly pry them out. You can put a lot of weight on the board that you can't get with a wrench or screwdriver.

Note: a little olive, sunflower, or canola oil around the outside of the bearing helps shimmy it out!


,

CAUTION: If you use water or WD-40, your bearings will rust and not work for long!
WD-40 is only good to get parts unstuck, not to grease them up for extended use.

, Roll them around a little. Get them moving again and use a cloth or paper towel to rub them off.


Tapping some of the dirt out of them works a little bit too. And depending on the bearing construction, a cotton swab is a good idea to get in the groove to reach spots that a towel can't get to.

, The easiest way to get the bearings in the wheels again is using your skateboard. Place the bearing face down on the trucks' wheel post and then push the wheel over it, squeezing the bearing into the wheel. Do this until all the bearings are in.

Note: if your bearings have metal spacers make sure you put them in before you put both bearings in your wheel.

, And clean off the posts of dirt and grease from last summer.
, Time to readjust your trucks' King pin. This is the mega-screw in the middle of your trucks. It adjusts how stiff or loose your turning is.

Note: If you're new to skateboarding, try a firm setup. If it's too loose, your ride will be wobbly.

, (They're the screws that hold your deck to the trucks.) They should be nice and tight.

, Your wheels should be spinning much smoother and faster now.

Plus, skateboarding provides a great opportunity to get out of the house and enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. Remind your parents that kids need exercise and outdoors time to stay healthy.;
, Talk about how much fun it would be to go skateboarding with your friends. Illustrate for your parents how skateboarding is an important social activity. For instance, point out that skateboarding with your friends is a great way to bond and make new friends., If your birthday or Christmas is coming up, you could ask for a skateboard as a gift.If you only ask for the skateboard and nothing else, you are more likely to get it.


If it's not that time of the year, be patient. Don’t forget that you want the skateboard, and keep the idea to ask for it in the back of your mind until the right season approaches.

, Alternately, you could offer to pay for part of the skateboard with allowance money or money earned from a part-time job.


Offer to help more around the house by, for example, mowing the lawn or doing the dishes.
Do not promise to improve your grades (or do anything else) if you don’t think you can. If you make a promise that you don’t or can’t fulfill, your parents will be less willing to buy you the next thing thing you ask for, or trust you when you make a deal with them.
Offer to sell some of your old stuff that you don’t want (an old guitar or action figure set, for instance) in exchange for a skateboard.

, If they know that your friends all have skateboards, but you don’t, they might feel that they are not doing their parental duty.


Before even sitting down and asking for your own board, mention your friends who skateboard to your parents. Tell them how your friends really enjoy it and how you think it seems really fun.
With enough subtle hints, your parents might offer to buy you a skateboard without you even asking.

Be persuasive.Make a PowerPoint or a poster showing the type of skateboard you want and information about the advantages of having a skateboard.,
Show appreciation.After your parents get you the skateboard, show them you appreciate them by giving them big hugs and a peck on the cheek.,
Don’t respond with anger if you don’t get it.Sometimes your parents can act unreasonable or unfair.",How to Convince Your Parents to Buy You a Skateboard2," Before talking to your parents, you’ll need to know what you want. Don’t make your parents do the legwork of figuring out what kind of skateboard to buy. Plus, if you leave it to them, you might end up with a board that you don’t like. Having all the information together ahead of time shows your parents you are serious about getting the skateboard.


Skateboards have three parts: the board, the wheels, and the trucks (the piece between the wheels and board). Shorter boards are best for beginners because they are easy to balance and handle.If you have experience riding a friend’s board, use it to determine what kind of style you like.
Pick a back-up board or two just in case your parents decide that your initial choice is too expensive.
If your parents don't have a lot of extra money to spare, trying to get a cheaper off-brand skateboard might make them more inclined to buy one for you.

, Schedule a time when one or -- preferably -- both your parents can give you their undivided attention.


Do not try to talk to your parents about buying a skateboard in the morning, as they will be busy with the morning routine of eating, brushing teeth, and gathering themselves for the workday.
Do not try to convince your parents to buy you a skateboard in the evening, since they might be tired.
The best time to talk to your parents is on the weekend when you all feel relaxed and can listen with an open mind.

, Parents like knowing they are appreciated. Try to preface your question by telling your parents you know they work hard.


For instance, you could say, “Mom/Dad, I know you work hard to provide for me. I’m very thankful for you and hate to ask for anything extra, but I was wondering if I could get a skateboard.”
Be honest when recognizing how your parents provide for you and showing your thanks.

, Include pictures, models, and a well-planned speech to accompany your visual aid. This will make you look responsible and demonstrate that you’ve put a lot of thought into getting a skateboard.

, You could make them a card that reads “For the Best Parents Ever” and write a brief message within referring to how thankful you are for their gift and how excited you are to receive your new skateboard.

, However, most parents usually do what they think is best for their children. Don’t yell, cry, or make accusatory statements at your parents if they don’t get you the skateboard at first.


For instance, if your parents reject the idea of buying a skateboard, do not say, “You don’t care about me!” That will not improve your chances of getting the skateboard, and could actually increase their resolve against the idea.
If your parents are hesitant to buy you a skateboard, ask them why. Once you’ve identified their main reason for not getting you a skateboard, think about how you can alleviate their anxieties or resolve the issues that led them to their decision.
If you suspect your parents will say no despite your thoughtful planning and the considerate way you asked them, ask them to wait a few days and think the matter over before making a decision about your request. The added time might allow them to consider everything you’ve shared more carefully.

Learn to practice on a friend’s skateboard.,
Demonstrate your commitment to safety.,
Make sure your parents know you will only skate in safe areas.",How to Convince Your Parents to Buy You a Skateboard3," Most falls and injuries occur with new or inexperienced skateboarders.If you have some practice under your belt before talking to your parents about getting your own skateboard, you can point to that experience to justify why you’re ready for your own board.


Start slow when learning how to skateboard. Ask your more experienced skateboarding friends for guidance and advice about how to maneuver and use the board properly.
Use the experience on your friend’s board to practice falling safely.

, Skateboarding really does carry the risk of serious injury to the body, especially the head and arms. Promise to wear all the appropriate safety gear, including a helmet, elbow and knee pads, wrist guards, and appropriate shoes.


Choose a helmet that fits snugly on your head. It should not be too tight or too loose, and sit low on your forehead. The straps should form a “V” around your ears.
Skateboarding is not recommended for children younger than five.
If you’re between the ages of six and ten, you should agree to supervision from a family member or trusted adult.
Agree to accept your parents’ safety instructions.
Promise to avoid doing risky stunts.Don't lie to your parents just to convince them to buy one for you. For example, don't say you will always wear a helmet if you aren't planning to once you get a skateboard. If you do this, your parents will probably just return the skateboard.

, Skating in the street can be dangerous, and skating in certain locations can be illegal.Do not skate in the street or use homemade skate ramps.Only use your board in approved public areas or skateparks.


If your parents only want you skating around the neighborhood, promise them that you will not go anywhere else.

Get a fresh board.",How to Ollie Higher on a Skateboard," To get the ollie down, you have set up your feet correctly. Traditional set up for the ollie requires you to have your front foot near the middle of the board and your back foot down by the tail of the board. You don't want the back foot to be hanging off the tail, but to be in the middle of the tail so you have a grip on the board. Your front foot should be just behind the last two bolts on the front part of your skateboard, completely parallel to them. Remember that you have to get this down and learn to do a regular ollie before you can start going higher in the air.;
, Now, you shouldn't move the front foot back too much, or your skateboard will just stand up vertically. However, if you've really gotten the regular ollie down solid, then you can move that front foot toward the center of your board, just two or more inches. Sliding that front foot is what gives you your lift, so the more sliding room you have, the higher you will go. You can start by just moving that foot back an extra inch or so, as you get more comfortable in this position.

, Now that you have a solid ollie, you can get it higher by sliding your front foot all the way to the nose of the board, up to the part where the board starts to curve upward. This way, your foot will get caught where it starts to rise, and since your foot is no longer sliding, if you keep moving it, it will bring the board higher in the air. Just remember that, even if you get it higher, you will still have to even out your board in the air by pushing gently with your front foot.

, Jumping higher is what will help you get your ollies higher. To get up higher, you'll need to pop the board harder, suck your feet up with the board, and jump higher than normal, trying to get your knees almost all the way up to your chest. You can raise your arms a bit more to help yourself get that extra lift too. Remember that you'll have to be really comfortable with your ollies to feel good about lifting your knees and body up that high when you jump.

, Along with jumping higher, one of your problems may be that you're not picking up your feet high enough. If you want to pick them up high enough, then you have to have your shoulders centered instead of hunching over too much, keeping your weight centered over the board to keep stable. When you snap your back foot, you need to really pull those feet up in the air. Some people focus on just lifting up that front foot, but it's important to have your back foot up, too.

, You can get down each aspect of the technique, but the most important part is putting it all together. You want the movement to be as fluid and smooth as possible, so you naturally move from the footwork to the jump, and back to the board again, without having any jagged or awkward movements. Whenever you're trying to get a move down, remember that timing is everything.

, This may sound obvious, but if you really want to get those ollies higher, then you have to keep practicing. But you can't just practice any old technique, or you'll just be repeating the same mistakes again. If you do master the footwork, jumping higher, sucking your feet and board up, and all of the other techniques we've discussed, then continuing to practice definitely will make perfect.

, Though some people like to practice their ollies first without any speed, you can try rolling to gather a bit more momentum to help you jump higher in the air. It's hard to jump high if you're generating all of the height from your own body without any speed to help you along. So, once you've got the ollie down flat, you can try moving, or even going a bit faster, to help yourself get the momentum you need to jump higher. A lot of people do start their ollies with some speed already, so if this is you, you can just try to go a bit faster as you practice more and more, especially if you're going over objects.

, Start small, working on doing an ollie over a garden hose, and then work your way up to doing an ollie over a shoebox, or another object that can be easily toppled without hurting you. Once you master this, you can try two shoeboxes or another higher object. Just making visual contact with an object before you jump over it can motivate you to jump higher than if you have nothing to clear. Having this goal set out for yourself can definitely help you get those ollies higher.

, If you have an old board that isn't in the greatest condition, then you won't be maximizing your ollie potential. A fresh board with some fresh grip tape can help you keep your feet planted on the board, and can also help you suck the board up with you when you jump up, so if you really want to ollie higher, you may consider getting a fresh board.

Bend your knees.,
Pop the nose and push it forward.,
Get the board in midair.,
Ride away clean.,
Kick your game up a notch.",How to Nollie," Doing a nollie straight up without moving is much harder than doing it after you've got some speed going. This will help you gather the momentum you need to pop up, and will give you height and control over your board. Take a running start before you get on your board to pick up the speed.






;
, Slide your front foot up to the nose of your board and get a nice weight position on the ball of your foot. This may be a tricky position to get comfortable with, and it will take a bit of practice. You have to feel steady here before you can move on.








, Yeah, this will feel a little funny at first, but you'll get used to it. Put that back foot in the middle of your trucks. The closer you move your foot to the front bolts, the higher you'll be able to nollie. However, the closer your back foot is to the front of your board, the less stable you'll be, so if you're more of a beginner, you can move that back foot a little further back.









Once you've positioned your front and back feet, you have to get comfortably balanced in this position before you try the nollie. If you feel off-kilter, then you won't be able to land the trick.

, This will help you gather the momentum you need to pop your board. While in most skate tricks, you'll be told to lean forward a little, for the nollie, you can actually lean back on your back foot a bit. You'll need to lift and raise that back knee before you raise your front one. You should also bend down with your back and arms to help yourself get nice and low. Your hands should fall somewhere between your knees and your ankles before you pop up.








, Use your front foot to pop your nose as hard as you can. Pop the board at an angle, away from you, not straight down. Now slide your back foot to the tail, just like you would when doing an ollie. This will help with leveling the board out.








, After popping the nose of your board, you should be able to get it in midair. Use your arms to help you and move them up, away from your sides as you move up to help your balance and height. Work on not shifting over to the left or right too much and staying as centered as you can.









At the highest point of your jump, your back foot will stop dragging and your board and your knees should be leveled out, both at the same position horizontally, and they should be parallel, too.

, Keep your board level as you land to stay centered. Make sure to maintain your balance as you ride away from the nollie in a secure position.








, Once you've learned the basic nollie, you can also work on doing a nollie kick flip, nollie 360, and nollie-tre flips. And if you need to brush up on your ollie, then you can try that, too. Who knows what you'll do next! Take your board the streets, skate parks, or even stairs and you'll be able to master some tricky moves in no time.

Make a clean landing.",How to 180 on a Skateboard," If you’re new to doing a 180 on your skateboard or haven’t done the trick in a while it’s a good idea to get your body used to being in the proper position.


Practice skating around for a bit by pushing off and then situating your body into the right position.;
, The ollie is the most fundamental skateboard trick and it’s incorporated into pretty much every trick you’ll do. And the 180 is an ollie where you turn your board and body 180-degrees. For the 180 you’ll be turning around either behind you for a backside 180, or in front of you for a frontside 180. Once you have the ollie down, you’re well on your way to doing a 180 skateboard trick!


If you ride “regular” you will have your right foot in the back positioned on the tail of the board. If you ride “goofy” then your left foot will be in back on the tail.
You want to position your back foot on the tip of the tail. To do a 180 on the skateboard, you’ll want to position your back foot on the corner of the tail.

, For a straight ollie your front foot will be centered about halfway up the board or slightly back.


You also want to put more pressure on the outer edge of your foot (the side your pinky toe is on).
To help you with turning, plant your front foot so its slightly hanging over the opposite edge of board from your back foot. This may feel awkward but it will help to keep your board balanced when you’re in the air.

, Your shoulders and your upper body is where most of the work will come from when you perform your 180.


By setting your shoulders correctly you will be able to turn your body quickly enough and this should allow your legs and the board to follow. You might be tempted to try and force the board to turn using mostly your legs, but you won’t get enough torque this way.
For a backside 180, position your front shoulder slightly in front of your chest and dip it down so when you pull up you have more momentum to work with.
For a frontside 180, you want to position back shoulder in front of your chest and dip it down as well so you can pull up and create momentum.

, You don’t want too much of a bend so that you end up crouching too low as that won’t allow you to pop high enough. You should stand with relaxed knees like you’re getting ready to hop slightly.


If you are bending correctly you should be able to slide your front forward up the board with ease.

, While you can perform a 180 on your skateboard from a stand still position, it will be easier if you already have some momentum going. A few pushes should work (if you are doing a gap then do more pushes, but you should only try this if you have done a 180 plenty of times before).


If this is your first time attempting this trick or you’re still new to it, then you should go at a slower pace so you have more of a handle on your board.

,


Plant your back foot on the tail of your board while you rotate and slide your front foot to the edge of the board.
Remember that your back foot should be on the back edge of the tail.

, If you’re doing a backside 180, have your front shoulder slightly lowered and in front of you and bend your knees. For a frontside, do the same with your back shoulder.


This part may feel natural, but if you wind too far, then you'll over spin. If you don't wind enough, then you won’t spin enough. This might take some practice so just remember to keep patient.
When you do try to execute the trick if you spin too much you’ll over rotate and you may lose your board from under you.
If you don’t spin enough your board won’t turn enough and may land sideways causing a stop to forward momentum.

, You may also want to start to turn the board in the direction you want it to go with your back foot. For a backside 180 you’ll be turning towards your back instead of your front, and vice versa for a frontside. It will be complicated in the beginning, and takes a few tries to fully get it.


For a backside 180, if you ride “goofy” you’ll want to start to turn the board to your right, and if you’re “regular” turn the board to your left.
For a frontside 180, “goofy riders will start to turn the board left, and “regular” riders will turn the board right.

, Push the tail of your board down until it hits the ground. When you feel it hit, that’s when you’ll begin to slide your front foot upwards.


Use force, but not too much, as too much pressure won’t allow you to get the lift you need.

,


For “regular” skaters you’ll swipe your left foot up and left for a backside 180, and right for a frontside 180.
For “goofy” skaters you’ll swipe your right foot up and right for a backside 180, and left for a frontside 180.

, Remember here that you’re turning starting at the top of your body with your shoulders and then letting your legs follow you.


As you spin your shoulders and then your waist and legs, lift your body upwards with your board.
Don't lock your knees. If you extend your legs and lock your knees you will push the board down and away from you, preventing it from spinning along with you.

, While you get the most torque and start your 180 with your shoulders, you end with your feet.


Here with a backside 180 you’re pushing your back foot forward while pulling back with your front front foot.
With a frontside 180 you’re pushing your front foot forward while pulling backwards on your back foot.

, If you’ve executed the 180 correctly, you’ll now be in mid air and your body will still be slightly wound up as your shoulders finish rotating with your feet not far behind.


This will all be happening in less than a second so try to just trust your body. Your momentum combined with how your body naturally moves should allow you unwind without trying too hard.
Try not to overcompensate when unwinding though, as you might turn too far and land at an awkward angle that could send your board flying out from under you.

, Of course, this is a lot easier said than done, but if you’ve successfully completed the 180-degree rotation then you should hit the ground rolling.


Take note that you will be riding switch (with your opposite foot forward) when properly executed, so you may want to get used to riding with your opposite stance.
Keep your knees bent so that you can properly absorb the shock of landing. This will also keep you balanced on your board, which may be harder for you if you’re not used to riding switch.
If you’re having a hard time landing straight the best thing you can do is to just keep practicing and take note of how far you are rotating. If you’re not making it far enough try turning your shoulders more. If you’re going too far, then do the opposite and ease up a bit.

Popping the board up in the air is actually the easiest part of the ollie. Before you try to ollie while moving, make sure you're riding properly and using smooth, even foot placement at all times when you skate.;
, Doing a stationary ollie is sometimes actually a lot easier than learning to ride a skateboard comfortably at speed, without doing much at all. Depending on the board you're using and your sense of balance, it's important to devote a considerable amount of time to just getting comfortable on the board, riding, turning, and stopping without falling down.









Check out this article for more tips about starting out and riding comfortably.

, When you fall, it's important to use your wrist pads to brace yourself, protecting yourself with your hands and your arms to protect your head as much as possible. If you feel the board slipping, bail out and take a bump on your butt or your hands at the expense of your head.









Only skate in safe and designated areas for skating to be safe, and try to scout for pebbles and cracks that'll mess you up while you're skating.
Always use proper safety equipment when you're skateboarding, and especially when you're attempting to ollie in motion. Never skateboard without wearing a helmet.
Even the best skaters are going to fall on a regular basis. No shame. Learn to fall properly and pick yourself back up.

, While it may seem safer to try on grass, it's pretty hard to actually ollie on grass, so just look for a smooth, flat, even slab of concrete. This will be a lot safer and yield better results than other surfaces.









Make sure everything is even and that you've got enough open space to do an ollie safely.
Always practice ollies on the ground first before trying them in motion. When you can stick ten consecutive ollies while stationary, then it's time to move on to an ollie in motion.

, While standing still, practice flexing your knees slightly to lower your center of gravity, and staying level. Then practice staying on the board while you pop the tail back. Do this a few times, staying even and level.









Stand next to the board and use your back foot to pop the tail down, as well, as you would in an ollie. Feel how much pressure is required to do it. Try doing 10-15 of these, or as many as it takes to get you to do it without thinking about it.

, When you're comfortable popping, pop the tail down and jump slightly. It's kind of hard to describe, because you should be doing it all in one smooth motion, moving your front foot forward to control the board as you pop it with your back foot. With some practice, you should get a basic ollie down.









If you need to bail out, bail out. You're just practicing. Try to land it if you can, but just try getting the board to pop at first.

, Snap the tail back and jump, pushing the board back level and landing on it. Keep practicing this basic motion, trying to get your stand-still ollie as high as you can, while maintaining stability and control of the board. Don't try to do it in motion until you can consistently do these and land them safely.









Try to land with your feet even with the truck bolts in the board, pushing the board back down toward the ground with your feet.

, Flex your knees before you ollie, squatting down if you're able to do it with balance. Lower your center of gravity and try moving your front foot slightly back when you ollie if you want to get a little more height. The more comfortable you are popping the board up and keeping it under control while you're on the ground, the more you'll be able to control the board while you're moving.









Try lifting your legs up with the board as well, after you pop it. Scoop the board up with it to get more height. If you hope to eventually ollie over obstacles, this will be an essential skill to develop.

, When you're feeling comfortable, get started at a relatively slow speed, but fast enough so that you'll be able to keep your balance when you get back on. Practice at your own speed and don't be afraid to bail out at first.









It's usually a little easier to land if you're going a little faster. If you're moving very slowly, the board has a tendency to slip from under you, while if you're moving along, you'll just go along with it.

, When you're moving and ready to pop, make sure your feet are balanced properly and comfortably, your front foot just behind the truck screws and in the middle of the board, your back foot resting on the tail and ready to pop.









It's good to lower your center of gravity slightly, but you don't need to crouch down really low to jump, even though it might look way cool. It does help you to pop the board up if you flex your knees slightly, maintaining your center of gravity and your control of the board.

, It's tough to break this down, because it's really one smooth motion. Think of it as ""scooping"" the board up into the air with you, by popping the tail to the ground with your back foot while simultaneously jumping up and forward with your body to allow the board to pop as you do it.









Some people find it helpful to use something like a crack in the sidewalk to use as a eye-guide for timing the jump, but it's not necessary.

, The back foot is used to pop the board, and the front foot is used to control it. Drag the side of your front foot up to the nose of the board, this will control the board, and allow you to get more air.









The scooped nose of the board can be excellent for catching the board and keeping it from getting away from you. Don't be afraid to move your foot pretty far forward to catch it.

, Once you have dragged your foot all the way to the nose, start to lift up your back foot, which should bring the board into the air with you. As you lift your back foot, the board should start to level out.








, Knees always need to be bent as you're completing an ollie to give yourself stability and balance as you land. At the same time, you want to push the board gently back down to the ground with both feet simultaneously, before it gets away from you.









As soon as your wheels make contact with the ground, make sure your knees are bent to absorb the impact.

, The most stable place to land is on the front and back truck bolts of the board, with both feet landing as close to the same time as possible. You should just keep rolling smoothly.









Put your arms out as you bring the board down, both to control your balance and to catch yourself and protect yourself if you start to fall.

, Too many skaters give up after getting frustrated and not getting a trick the first afternoon. The only way to learn to ollie in motion is to practice. If you can't do it at first, keep working on your basic skating and board control, which is as important a part of skateboarding as pulling off an ollie. Don't rush it. Keep working.

Jump into the air, first with your front foot, and after with your back foot.,
Jump up, and kick down the back of your board at the same time.,
Slide your front foot as soon as you start jumping.,
Pull your knees up towards your chest.,
Level out with both when your front foot has slid all the way up, keeping pressure on the board as it begins to fall down.,
Try to land both feet at the same time, preferably with your feet as close to their respective trucks as possible.",How to Ollie," Get a good feel for its shape, the tightness of your trucks, and the size of your wheels. Ollies are always easier on a familiar setup. If your trucks are too loose and you can't keep in control while crouching, then tighten them until things are a bit smoother.;
, Getting the foot positioning right can be the first really tricky part of an ollie to master. The ball of your back foot should be half hanging off the edge of the deck's tail, or back. The ball of your front foot should be central to the deck, somewhere between the bolts.









The actual position of your feet is very important. How far forward/back you choose to have your front foot is mostly a preference thing, but it can affect your ollie too.

Huge monster ollies will require your foot to be further back, but will be more difficult.
Little curb-hoppers can be easily done with your foot further forward.



, Start off in a stationary position. Balancing your crouch properly is crucial. Don't bend your back too much and don't stick your bottom out too far. Try to drop down and keep your shoulders level with your feet.









Try to stay on the balls of your feet, especially when crouching. If you just go up on your toes, chances are you'll start turning back-side when you jump. (If you weren't already aware, the back-side edge is the one nearest your toes).
If you've moving while you ollie, there are two good ways to reposition your feet so that they're properly balanced before you jump.

The first is a tiny little jump, just big enough to let you land with your feet where you need them. This is the best and quickest way, but also the trickiest.
The second way is to just shuffle your feet into position. It's a slower, less accurate method, and it ruins your shoes pretty quickly unless your grip tape is dead — which it shouldn't be if you want to be able to ollie well.



, The board isn't going anywhere with your weight on it, so the beginning of an ollie maneuver is to jump. Sometimes it's easier to think of it as jumping off of your back foot. If you're having trouble with the height of your ollie, just forget about sliding (for the moment) and slam your knees into your chest.








, A good strong pop is very important; it's the power behind your ollie. It's called a pop because of the noise of your deck hitting the ground, which will make it bounce.









Timing of the pop is crucial. After jumping, pop the board as soon as you feel your weight lessening on the board.

This may seem tricky, as the jump and pop seem instantaneous, but visualizing it this way helps a lot.


If you're new to skateboarding, chances are you've probably tried the maneuver of stamping on the tail to make it jump up at you. It's the same principal with a pop, except you're doing it while standing on (actually, more like jumping above) the board.
Another possible reason for the tail not lifting is that your foot might be hitting the ground with the tail too much, not allowing the actual board to lift. You want the ground to help snap the deck up, but not so much that the board gets bogged down and your timing is messed up.

, Turn your front foot inward and slide up the front of the board in a rolling motion. Bring your back leg up toward your chest as you do this.









Remember that this step must be performed at the same time as jumping. Sliding too soon will result in an ollie with little height; sliding too late will result in an ollie that doesn't get leveled out at its highest point.

, Exactly how far you need to do this depends on how high your ollie is, but the board can only go as high as your feet, so if you want your ollie to be high you have to bring those feet up.








, Make the board level to the ground while in mid-air. In other words, don't have the front of the board sticking up in mid-air. This technique will help tremendously when you get to jumping gaps.








, If you land an ollie with both feet in the middle of your deck, it's going to snap. Likewise, if you land on your nose and tail, they could break off. Make sure you bend your knees to absorb the shock when you land.

,
Smooth the finished design.",How to Paint Your Skateboard," This process can create a large amount of sawdust, and spray paint can easily spatter to the surrounding area or your clothes. Make sure you are wearing clothes that you don't mind ruining, and lay a tarp or drop cloth on any surfaces you want to protect.


Be sure the area you are working is well ventilated. In an enclosed area, the fumes from spray paint can build up and become toxic.;
, The truck and its associated parts connect the wheels of your board to the deck. You'll need to loosen and remove the four truck bolts on both trucks. Use a wrench to loosen and remove the nuts on those bolts by turning the nuts in a counterclockwise direction. Then, pull the bolts free and place the two trucks of your board in safe place.








Older boards might have bolt nuts that are difficult to remove. If the nuts on your truck bolts are resisting your attempts at removal, spray an appropriate anti-oxidizing agent, like WD-40 or Diet Coke., Place your truck-less board on your work surface and turn it so the top of the deck is facing down. The current design on the bottom of your board should now be facing up. Use your electric sander with 40-grit sandpaper and use steady, firm pressure to completely remove the original design from your board. Then, use 150-grit sandpaper to give the surface of your board an even smoother finish. Smoothing should only take about 5 minutes.










Always wear protective gear when sanding. Sawdust kicked up into the air can irritate or damage your eyes, throat, and lungs. Be sure you wear protective glasses and a dust mask.
Be patient with this initial sanding. In some cases, it might take as long as 20 minutes before the design is removed.
Avoid applying uneven pressure with your sander. This could result in you scoring the board or an uneven sanding, both of which will have a negative effect on the uniformity of your paint job., Use a stiff bristle brush or a lint/fuzz-free rag to clear away any remaining sawdust from your board. Be thorough during this step. If you miss sawdust, it can cause clumping or other irregularities in your paint job.









Avoid using wire bristle brushes, or any brush you think might damage the smooth finish of your board., This can be done with carpenter grade wood filling paste, which you can find at most hardware stores. Mix and apply the paste to pressure cracks and chips in your board according to the directions of the paste. In most cases, you should apply a generous amount of paste to each defect in the board.









Irregularities in the paste will be sanded away later, so don't worry if your filler paste clumps. Allow the paste to dry as long as indicated by the directions; in most cases this will take about 24 hours., Again, using 150-grit sandpaper, use your sander to smooth the repaired areas of your board. Apply firm, regular pressure when sanding. It should only take you about five minutes before the wood filler is uniform with the rest of your sanded board.







, Failing to tape the sides and top of your board might result in drips or streaks along the sides and grip of your board. Use painters tape to ensure the tape pulls free easily from the board.








, An aerosol primer will run less of a risk of an uneven application. Paint brushes loaded with too much primer can end up being too think in some areas and not thick enough in others. In both cases, be sure you follow the directions for your primer. Brush








You may want to wait until your primer dries and then apply a second layer of primer to your board. A second layer of primer can provide an even better surface for the paint you will be applying.
For aerosol primers, be sure you shake it for the amount of time directed in its instructions. In most cases, you will need to shake the spray can for about 2 minutes. Failing to do so could result in an inadequate prime coat.
Common problems with aerosol primers include drips and bubbles in the prime coat. Always allow your primer to dry completely before sanding it smooth.
Allow each layer of primer to dry completely after you apply it. Depending on the primer you have used the time will vary, but in most cases 30 minutes should be long enough.
Always wear a dust mask/respirator and protective eye-wear when spray painting to prevent accidentally breathing in the toxic spray or getting any in your eyes., Again using your 150-grit sandpaper, lightly sand your primed board. Use gentle back and forth motions to ensure any clumps, bubbles, blisters, or other irregularities are removed.










Do not sand the primer until you can see the grain of the wood. After sanding, you may be able to see faint traces of the wood through the primer; this is normal.
Using a soft bristle brush or lint/fuzz free rag/t-shirt, wipe free all sawdust from your board. Be thorough when you do this; any remaining sawdust can cause irregularities in your paint job.
To ensure you remove stubborn particles of primer-sawdust from your board, you may want to do a final pass over your board with a dampened lint/fuzz free rag/t-shirt. Allow the board to dry completely after this wipe down., A tack coat is a gentle application of a thinning agent that cleans the freshly primed wood of your board, preparing it for the spray paint. You'll want to use a thinner that matches the kind of acrylic spray paint you've chosen for your board. In most cases, this will be a lacquer thinner, not a paint thinner.









Wet a paper towel or a rag with a small amount your thinning agent and run it along the dry, primed bottom of your board. If you notice your paper towel or rag getting dirty, wet a clean portion with your thinning agent of your paper towel or rag and finish wiping the rest of the board.
Avoid using a fuzzy rag or paper towel that might deposit lint on the surface of your board. You should try not to touch the cleaned part of your board with your hands, as this could transmit oil or dust to it and affect your paint application.
An old cotton t-shirt is a good option for tacking., You'll be using a series of stencils to apply layers of paint to your board. The unpainted areas left behind by your stencils will form the design of your board. A simple, stencil-free way of achieving the same effect involves covering areas of your board with tape in creative patterns., By sketching out the design beforehand, you're less likely to make a mistake when applying the paint. Take a piece of paper and draw the rough shape of the deck of your board. Then, inside the deck, sketch out your design.









Beginners might want to stick with geometric designs, using squares, rectangle, triangles, and lines. The straight lines of these will be easier to create stencils for, or, in many cases, can be created with tape., If you want your board to have three colors, you'll need to apply three layers of paint, four colors will require four layers, and so on. Inside the designs you have created, number each design according to layer. For example, if you want the squares in your design to be red and you plan on applying red in the first layer, draw a ""1"" inside each square of your design.







, You won't need to do this if you are simply using tape to create designs in your board. More complicated designs and shapes with arcs, like circles, will likely need a stencil.


You can make your stencils out of many different materials. Some common options include cardboard, mylar, or rigid card stock., This color will form the background upon which you will layer your stenciled designs. A high contrast color, like black or white, will allow the other colors that make up your design to stand out better. Spray your board with your base color so the smoothly sanded bottom of your board is completely covered in an even layer of paint.









Be sure you follow the directions on your aerosol paint before using it. Most will require that you shake the can for a certain amount of time and hold it a designated distance from the surface you are painting.
Wait until your paint is fully dry before moving on to the next coat of paint. In some cases, this may take as many as 24 hours. Applying the next layer of paint too soon could case your first layer to mix with the next, blending the colors together., The places you cover with your stencil/tape will remain the color of your base layer. The gaps in your stencil/tape will be painted the color of your next layer. Spray your second layer over the entire bottom of your board to ensure you have an even application.









You might want to leave some extra tape extending beyond the edge of your board, or for stencils/tape designs in the center of your board, you may want to overlap the ends of your tape, bending back one end to stick up from the board. This will make removing stencils/tape easier when you are finished.
Do not apply another layer until your second layer is completely finished drying. Once it is, continue adding stencils/tape and new layers of paint to your board in this fashion to complete your design.,, But first, allow the paint a minimum of 24 hours to dry and set. Then you should use 220-grit sandpaper to lightly sand your finished paint job. This will give a uniform finish to the board and remove any irregularities from it. Once you have finished sanding, wipe free the sawdust with a damp, lint/fuzz free rag/t-shirt. Wait 15 minutes, and then remove the tape on the sides/top of your board. Reattach your trucks and your design is done!"

",How to Be a Skater Girl," No cheap ones from Walmart. Although they are $25 dollars and can be tempting, don't buy one from there or any other stores like that. Get one from a good skate store. Don't focus on what it looks like, just get a good, complete mini logo deck. Go to a local skate store and ask anyone questions. Do not be afraid to say, ""Hey, I'm new at this stuff and I was wondering..."" They will most likely be more than glad to help you out.;
, A smaller board and medium-sized (53mm-57mm), soft-ish (92a-98a) wheels will be easier to learn on. Independent trucks turn the best but Thunders or Ventures are better for a beginner since they turn less and make your wheelbase longer so your board will feel more stable. Save up the money and go to your local skate shop and purchase a complete setup including deck, trucks, wheels, and bearings. Ask them if they can put it together or learn how to do it yourself. Also, have them go over the parts of the board with you. You can also get other parts for your board and trick it out to make it you. For example, get grip tape with crazy designs on them and different colored wheels and trucks. Or you can bust out the paint pens and spray paint.

, A helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, etc. A lot of skaters just wear nothing or a simple baseball cap to look good, don't be that oblivious to risk your own head for the looks, or you could suffer major, permanent damage. This may sound like your parents talking, but if you fall down you'll be glad you have a helmet on.

, Normal shoes don't grip well on skateboards, and if you want to do tricks such as ollies, kickflips and all of those other cool tricks, your regular shoes will rip in 30 minutes. Suede and leather are more durable than canvas. Emerica/Etnies, Lakai, Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma, Vans, DC, Supra, Circa, DVS, Globe, Habitat and Fallen all make good skate shoes. Most importantly, never buy girl skate shoes! You can get them for looks, but they don't do much good. For about same price, you can get longer lasting, better gripping, guy's (boy's/kid's or men's) skate shoes. You could always get plain skater shoes and decorate them later using a paint pen or sharpie. A shoe size conversion chart will help sizing guy's shoes or try 1.5-2 sizes smaller than girls shoe sizes. http://www.zumiez.com/size-chart click on shoes

, Don't try to grind the rails, kickflip off of 10 stair stairset. Just cruise around until you are comfortable. Also, you might want to figure out your stance. Regular is riding with your left foot forward and pushing with your right foot. Goofy is riding with your right foot forward and pushing with left foot. Pushing Mongo (with your front foot) is a bad habit to get into, because you don't have as much balance, and it takes longer to get into a cruising stance from a pushing stance. To learn more, go to about.com and search.

, This is what every trick in skateboarding comes from. It's very important. Also go to the skate park to learn. I mean be modest, but people don't care if you're bad. Then you can ask people ""Hey can you help me with my ollie?"". It's always good to do this, and don't be afraid to ask: it makes people feel good.

, Once you know a thing or two about skating, find some friends who are willing to join you. It's funnier to be skating with friends than alone. Besides, do you really want to fall down, look silly and have a bruise alone? No. Get some friends.

, If you are learning how to skateboard, don't act like you're the coolest skater girl ever to step on a skateboard. Be honest and humble about your abilities.

, Know what all the parts of a skateboard are called and know what to call the tricks you do. Deck, bearings, trucks, wheels, grip tape; easy enough.

, Practice the basics of skating. You can watch skate How-To's on Youtube, but the best way to learn is to actually go outside and start.

, Learn how to fall... Fear is your worst enemy when learning how to skateboard. Make sure to wear the right gear when skating and don't rush into learning complicated tricks until you have mastered rolling, stopping, pushing, carving, turning, kickturns, and the ollie.

, The only things you'd want from there if you're committed to looking cool would be band t-shirts, hoodies, and piercings.

, A little is great, like something more natural. If you wear heavy eyeliner and eye shadow is cool too, if it works for you, but just take note that it doesn't work for everyone. You get all sweaty skateboarding, and then your makeup just wears off and it's uncomfortable.

, It's really difficult to get sponsored though. Some of the best skaters can't get sponsored by anyone but their local skate shop.

, There are several types of skaters: Freestylists, who basically make up their own cool tricks, street skaters, who are all about jumps and grinds, vert skaters who do flips, ramps, and are usually the people you see on TV, and cruisers, who are a sort of relative of skaters, who are mainly about some ramps, stance, and lots of speed. Cruisers are usually mistaken for posers. But if that's what you do, it's ok.

Put-downs.,
Your Put-downs.",How to Be a Hardcore Skater," Skateboarding is a very dangerous sport, and you can really get hurt. Always wear a helmet and if you're just starting out or you feel insecure, wear padding.;
, There's no way you can be a skater, if you don't skate. Then you'd just be a poser. Go to a skate shop and get the clerk to help you get the right stuff.

, A big part of becoming the style of a skater, is seeing if you have it or not. Skaters are usually very extroverted and don't care what people think of them. But, you can also be skater if you are an ambivert and moshing.

, Yes, there is music that can be seen as skater. You can mix in hip-hop, rap, rock, Metalcore, metal, indie, emo, punk, punk pop, and old stuff together. Try bands like Green Day, Rancid, Linkin Park, and other music like that. Most of the stuff you already listen to could be considered skater, so if you like it, listen to it.

, Every subculture has its own style of speaking. So try out these words and see if they fit.


Dude

A male.

""Dude, did you see that?""




Chick

A female.

""Did you see that chick?""




Rad

Awesome or cool.

""Dude, that was rad!""




Sweet

Awesome or cool.

""That was a sweet trick.""




Sick

Awesome or cool.

""I heard the half pipe there was real sick.""




Sketchy

A skateboarding trick that is not landed nicely or not landed at all.
Not good, example: a dark man calling you into an alley.

""That trick was sketchy.""
""Did you see that sketchy guy by the corner store?""




Shady

Same as sketchy.

""Man, he was shady...""




Clean

The opposite of ""sketchy"" and ""shady"".

""That was a clean landing.""





, Now that you've hopefully gotten into the part that counts, try dressing like a skater. Some good brands include 'Etnies', Element, DC, Circa, Quicksilver, Billabong, Vans, and Zoo York. You don't always have to have brand name things, though. Even second hand shops like Goodwill and Value Village have some nice things.


Pants






You can wear them tight or baggy, depending on what you like.
Rips are really good, and they scream, ""I can skate."" Just don't make them yourself. Actually try skating and ripping them from shredding an awesome trick.
Graffiti pants. Write, write, write all over your pants. Make sure you only do this to 1 or 2 of your pants.
Skater shorts. If it's hot out, wear shorts with pockets.
Cargo pants/shorts are nice, too.


Shirts






Any shirt is really good, doesn't matter if it's tight or baggy... Just don't match baggy things up too much, or you end up looking like a gangster.


Shoes






Skater shoes. These are usually the only shoes skaters wear, because they have flat bottoms and can grip to the board. Try DC, Vans, Fallen or DVS .


Hair

Any color of hair usually works if it's long. Lots of skaters have curly hair, so don't bother buying a straightener unless you want to. Many skaters also have straight or wavy hair. Just go natural, man.


Hats

Flat brimmed hats usually end up making your head look wide and flat.
Any hat will really work, but only if it's a ball cap or toque. You don't see skaters walking around in cowboy hats and boas.


Belts

Skaters always wear belts to keep their pants from falling down when they are skateboarding. Shoelaces always work. Can't have the other skaters at the skate park seeing those underpants.



, It's time to see what you do about those put-downs. If someone calls your skating crappy or calls you a poser, try not to care. Most of them probably just think your style is too rad for them.

, A lot of people at the skate park make fun of each other, but they are usually friends. If you go around making fun of everyone, you won't have any friends after a few months, and everyone will think of you as a jerk. Remember, never call anyone on a board a poser, no matter how bad they are. They're probably just beginning. You can't be a poser if you're trying!

Learn how to skateboard.,
Dress Like a Skater.,
Talk Like a Skater.,
Be Yourself.",How to Be a Skateboarder," This should be obvious but it's worth emphasizing. You'll never be accepted as a skater in the long run if you can't back up your behavior with your skills. To learn how to skateboard, just ride as much as possible. To learn what a trick is, it might help to play skateboarding games. The Tony Hawk video game series is good, but only the MoCap games. American Wasteland, Project 8 and Proving Ground are the best, because real pro skateboarders motion captured it just for the game. EA Skate also helps, but it's a bit more complex. Just go out and skate!;
, Dress however you feel comfortable. skate brands are an obvious choice, but remember, just because you dress like a skater, doesn't mean you are. If you only ever wear DC or Adio, you'll probably get called a poser. Don't be afraid to be different. I wear skate clothes AND stuff like Gap and Old Navy. Wear whatever your style is, skateboarding is all about being different, rebelling from the normal, and having fun.

, Every subculture has its own lingo. So do skateboarders. Become familiar with skateboarding vocabulary, hang out at the local skate shop or skatepark and see what the kids are saying. Don't overdo it, though. Posers might say it, but skateboarders NEVER say ""hang-ten, dude!"". ""Dude"" is a normal word in skateboarding lingo, and you'll probably hear it among skaters as often as ""like"" and ""the"".

, Skateboarding is all about having fun while being a rebel. But don't say dude in every sentence just because Dude Skater did. Skateboarding is huge. There are punk skaters, rocker skaters, hip-hop skaters, emo skaters, normal skaters and various other skaters. Don't be afraid to hop over sub-cultures. Don't be afraid to be yourself.

,,,, It is important to remember to keep your weight back slightly, too much and you'll fall backwards. If you lean forward (a common mistake) the board shoots behind you and you'll only land it with pure luck.

, Having both your feet land on the bolts is ideal.

Be prepared.",How to Kickflip on a Skateboard," The first thing you need to look at is your foot placement:









Your front foot should be placed just behind the bolts on your board, pointing slightly towards the front at a 45 degree angle.
The ball of your back foot should be perched on the tail of your board.
Don't hunch forwards, keeping your shoulders in line with your board.;
, Hopefully you already know how to ollie, but just to recap:









Bend your front knee and put all of your weight on the ball of your back foot.
This causes the front of the board to lift, while the back pops off the ground and then bounces up.
Try to ollie as high as you can, as this will give you more time to complete the kickflip.

, While you're in the air, slide your front foot towards the front heel-side edge of the board. Kick your leg out, flicking the edge of your deck with your baby toe. This is what gives it its spin.









This move is a little tricky, so make sure you understand it fully before you try it. Make sure you are kicking your leg outwards and upwards, not downwards. Otherwise your foot will end up beneath the board and you won't be able to land properly.
Don't kick too hard either, otherwise you'll send your board spinning away from you. Also be sure to jump high enough so that your back foot also comes off the board (though not as high as the front foot)., Once the skateboard has completed a full rotation in the air, catch it with your back foot and slam it towards the ground. Once your back foot hits the board, your front foot should follow suit.









In order to figure out when your skateboard has completed a full rotation, you will need to keep your eyes on it as you jump, which can be tricky. Do your best to get the timing right, and land with your feet over the bolts on the front and back of your deck.
Another important point to remember is to try to keep your shoulders level (as opposed to having one higher than the other) and facing in the direction you're going. This will help you to keep your balance as you land your flip.

, As your board hits the ground, bend your knees in order to absorb the shock.









This will also help you to maintain control of the skateboard.
If you're practicing your kickflip while rolling, just continue on, trying your best to look cool.

, Kickflips are the most difficult of the basic tricks, so it can take a while to get them down perfectly. Don't let yourself get frustrated - just keep practicing until you get it right.








, A double kickflip is when the board flips over twice in the air before you land. It involves the same technique as a regular ollie, you just need to flick the board a little harder and faster. You can also try for a triple kickflip, where the board flips over three times before landing.

, A varial kickflip is a combination of a kickflip and and a shove-it, where the board spins around 180 degrees as it flips. You can achieve the shove-it rotation by popping the board on the toe side of the tail, then flicking the nose with your front foot to achieve the flip.

, A kickflip body varial involves the skater switching their position mid-air, instead of the board. With this particular trick, the skater flips their body 180 degrees frontside, then lands in a switch stance.

, With a kickflip indy, you do a kickflip, flicking the board a little further out than you normally would, and grab the board in your hand before you land. You need to be rolling pretty fast and jumping high for this one.

, The kickflip underflip is a very advanced trick which takes lots of practice to master. After the board has completed one rotation during a kickflip, you use the top of your toe to flick the board so it spins in the opposite direction., Before you attempt to kickflip, you should probably be pretty comfortable on a skateboard.


You should be familiar with all the parts on a skateboard, have decent balance and know how to ollie.
You can practice your kickflip while rolling or stationary - it really depends on personal preference.
Extremely important to have learnt before you even attempt to practice Kickflips: Ollie, Frontside 180, Backside 180, Pop-shuvit, and Frontside Pop-shuvit. Successfully learning these tricks will have increased your board control significantly for much faster progression when learning the Kickflip.
Some people find it easier to learn while rolling, while others prefer to get their technique down in a stationary position first.

Next, go to your local skate park and skate with random people, but don't play too much or else the skater you're playing with will think that you are a poser. Make sure that person is cool with you if they are jerks don't waste your time with them. Enjoy playing skate with them and show you are down to skate. If you try your best, that person will talk about you with his/her friends.;
, Show everybody that you are down to skate.

, but make sure they are well known and they are down to skate with you everyday if you do that make sure you invite your friends to skate with you or the crew.

, Also skate where there's a lot of people. If you are shy that you might fall when the people are looking at you, don't worry just skate and try your best to impress them. If you fall just get back up and do that trick again until you land it. Then people will know that you are a good skater. If you are still shy well just pretend they are not there. Don't try to look all bad-ass then the people will call you poser right behind your back. Just be yourself and everything will be alright. Also don't show off its really stupid to show off.

, If you think the video is good go to your local skate shop and show your video to them. If they like it the skate shop will make you well known.

Position your feet correctly.,
Push down the tail with your back foot.,
Jump and kick out with your front foot.,
Stick it to the ground.,
Practice it with other tricks.",How to Heel Flip," Put the toe of your back foot at the corner of the tail. Place your front foot in the middle of the board, closer to the nose. The toe of your front foot should hang off the edge a bit.


Your feet should be parallel with each other, creating a sort of diagonal line across the board.
You can do this trick when you're moving or practice it from a stationary position.;
, Give it a firm push to tip it toward the ground as you're moving. As you push, keep your knees bent and crouch down to get ready to jump. You want to crouch so low that your fingers can touch the ground. Otherwise, you won't be able to generate enough power to flip the board.

, When you hear the tail hit the ground, come out of your crouch. As you jump, you want to kick forward with your front foot so that your heel spins the board forward. This will cause the board to flip around under you while you're still in the air.


Give the board a good hard shove with your front foot. Otherwise, it won't flip all the way around.
Be sure to stay above the board; don't let it move from side to side.
Make sure your jump has enough height. You don't want the board to get caught under your feet.

, Come out of your jump by landing squarely on the board, which should be directly under you. Try to land on the bolts. Doing this will provide a safer, smoother landing, and prevent your board from snapping.

, If you're advanced enough to do a heel flip, you've likely already mastered the ollie, which is the first trick everyone learns. But have you tried out these other great tricks?

Have the right gear.,
Get comfortable on a skateboard.,
Practice some basic tricks.,
Position your feet properly.,
Push off the board.,
Clear your feet.,
Watch for the grip tape.,
Keep practicing.",How to Pressure Flip," Ideally you should have a shortboard skateboard, although experts can do pressure flips on old school and cruiser boards. You won’t be able to pull one off on a longboard. Skate shoes aren’t necessary for skating, but may be more comfortable and will last longer if you skate a lot. If you don’t have skate shoes, wear something you won’t mind damaging. Even though you aren’t doing insane jumps on your skateboard, you should still have the proper safety gear. Wear a helmet whenever you are skating. Concussions are fairly common in skateboarding, and a helmet will go a long way in protecting your brain. Make sure it fits snugly for the best protection. ;
, Push off with your back foot experiment with shifting your weight around on the board. Try some turns, both sharp ones and gentle ones. Get comfortable moving your feet around on the board. Practice getting off the board quickly so you can minimize injuries from falling.

, A pressure flip might be the first trick you learn on a skateboard, but it’s a good idea to have a few other ones under your belt first. Ollies and shove-its are some good tricks to learn before you try to do a pressure flip.


To ollie, put the ball of your back foot on the edge of the skateboard’s tail and your other foot a few inches behind the front bolts. Push down hard with your back foot to pop the board off the ground while bending your front knee. Slide the side of your shoe up and off the tip of the board and lift up your back foot at the same time. Try to keep your weight centered over the board to stick it. To do a shove-it, place the ball of your back foot on the edge of the skateboard’s tail and your front foot just behind the front bolts. Press down and towards you with your back foot while at the same time lifting up your front foot. The board should spin 180° underneath you. Put your feet back on the deck and skate it out to land the trick. , Pressure flips are impossible without proper foot position. Place your back foot just behind the back trucks. The ball of your foot and big toe should nestle in the bend of the tail with the rest of your toes just barely hanging off the edge. Angle it slightly towards the nose. The position of your front foot doesn’t matter much, but most people find it comfortable to have it a few inches behind the front bolts slightly angled towards the nose. If your board just flips over backwards, you need to move your back foot up slightly. If the board sort of just rolls over on its side and lands on its back, you need to move your back foot back a little more. You’ll have to experiment a bit to find the sweet spot., To do this trick, you have to transfer all of your weight to the ball of your foot and big toe on your back foot. After your weight has transferred to your back foot, you’ll use it to “scoop” the board and flip it over.When you transfer your weight to your back foot, your board will come extremely close to touching your wheel, almost giving you wheel bite. At this moment, lift up your front foot and put all your weight on the ball and big toe of your back foot. Push towards diagonally forwards towards yourself with this part of the back foot. It won’t pop like other flip trick, but the board will hit the ground a little bit before flipping over. If you do it right, it will feel like you’re ""scooping"" the board with your back foot.
A common mistake is trying to pop the board and jump off like you would for an ollie. The board will either flip too much or not enough if you pop it too hard. Your deck will touch the ground, but it’s different from the pop you do for other flip tricks. You’ll have to learn both to get a feel for it., The board will come up pretty high during a pressure flip, so you need to pull your feet up to clear the board. Bend at your waist and knees to bring your feet up into the air. Extend your arms while you’re in the air to help you stay balanced and over the board.

, If the board is relatively straight and you can see the grip tape, it’s time to land the trick. Straighten slightly at the knees and waist, but not all the way. Staying a little bent will help you absorb the shock of landing. Try to put your feet back on the board on or in between the bolts for a stable landing. Many people find it easier to land slightly back on the board as well.Skate it out to officially land the trick.

, You probably won’t be able to consistently land pressure flips after you stick your first. Keep practicing them so the foot positions and motion become second nature. Eventually, you’ll be able to add your own flair to the trick that makes it your own. You may even be able to do it into grinds or combine it with spins, although don’t expect to achieve this on your first day.

An ollie serves as the base for most skateboard tricks, like an inward heelflip. Before attempting an inward heelflip, get comfortable performing an ollie, heelflip, and a pop shove-it.


An ollie is when you kick your board up into the air and then land back on the ground.
A heelflip is when you use your front heel to flip your board 360-degrees in a counterclockwise rotation.
A pop shove-it is when you perform an ollie while scooping the tail of your board causing your board to rotate 180 degrees.
In order to perform even a heelflip, you will have to start out as if you are doing an ollie. Then while you’re in the air, you will rotate your board toward with your heel.;
, Place your leading foot near the middle of your board. Place your back foot on the tail of your board.


Your front foot should be wholly on your board for an ollie. Your back foot should be hanging off the board a bit. You want the ball of your foot to be planted on the board with your heel over the edge.
Make sure you feel comfortable with the placement of your feet. Where exactly you place your feet will be up to you and what feels the most natural.
In skateboarding there are two types of stances, Goofy stance is when you face your body left in the direction of travel. Your right foot is in front. Regular stance is when you face right in the direction of travel. Your left foot is in front.

, When you crouch to do an ollie you want to bend at your knees so your body stays balanced. Put your weight on the balls of both feet.


To perform an ollie, you need to use your feet and legs to kick the board up into the air. Properly bending your knees will give you leverage.
Keep your shoulders squared and level with your feet.
Pop up into an ollie. Snap the tail of your board down onto the ground with your back foot. Simultaneously, slide your front foot forward up the length of the deck toward the nose. As you make these moves, you want to use the momentum to jump up in the air.
Your front foot lifts the board off the ground and also levels out the board in the air.
Slide your front foot with the outer edge of your foot, not the bottom of it.
Once you get the hang of performing an ollie, practice doing an ollie while moving. Having more forward momentum may make landing an inward heelflip easier.
Next, move on to incorporating the pop shove-it. Instead of snapping down with your back foot, you want to scoop it backward.

, An inward heelflip is essentially a pop shove-it with an extra step to the trick. Begin by setting your feet as if you are going to perform an ollie or pop shove-it.


Place your front foot toward the middle of the board and your back foot on the tail. , Unlike a regular ollie, the heelflip, and inward heelflip requires you to do a little more work with your front foot. You’ll need to flip your board with the heel of your front foot, so you want to position it more forward.


Place your front foot so that the toes of your foot are hanging over the front edge of your board.
You may also want to play with how far forward your front foot is. For the heelflip portion of the trick, you’ll be kicking your foot up and out at the same time. Try placing your front foot closer to the nose of your deck.
Don’t place your front foot too far forward otherwise you won’t get enough leverage. Try placing your foot just behind the bottom front bolts.
You can rotate your front foot to about a 45-degree angle. The angle will help you flick your foot and spin the board.

, For an inward heelflip, your back foot is also going to be doing a little more than it would for an ollie or regular heelflip. Place your back foot closer to the tip of the tail for a heelflip. Placing your back foot higher up on the tail will help you get more pop and allow you to jump higher, getting your foot out of the way while the board flips.


Play around adjusting your back foot closer to the opposite edge of the board that your front foot is on. Though you need your board to flip in a forward motion, going counterclockwise, moving your back foot to the back edge will help you with balance and with getting the pop shove-it rotation.
When you perform the trick, you’ll need to scoop the tail of the board back a little. While you pull back slightly with your back foot to scoop the board, your front foot will be flicking the opposite edge to create the flip.

, With your feet positioned for a heelflip, get used to how your body feels. Rock back and forth and bend your knees.


Get used to how you feel with your feet in this new position. Practice sliding your front forward and flicking the edge of your board with your heel. Remember to keep your body centered.

, Begin your inward heelflip by popping the back of your board down like you would an ollie. Then as the board begins to rise from the action in your front foot, scoop the tail back a little to start the inward rotation. The inward heelflip begins pretty much the same way as an ollie does. The difference is that your back foot is more on the edge of your board’s tail. And instead of keeping the board connected to your back foot, like you might with an ollie, you’re kicking that back foot up and higher in a scooping motion to give the board room to rotate.

, Slide your front foot up toward the nose of your board like you would with an ollie. Then, instead of moving your foot toward the center of the nose, kick it forward and out in front of you. The trick here is to flip your board by hitting the front edge with your heel. Your front foot should kick out almost as if you were to do a forward karate kick.
Keep the toes of your front foot pointed up. As you kick out, you’re trying to smack the edge of the board with your heel as you bring your foot up and in front of you. Aim to catch the board on your heel where the slope of the nose begins. By hitting the front of the board down where the nose begins to slope on the outer edge, and scooping the tail up you’re creating the inward momentum that will cause the board to flip and rotate.
Though your heel is hitting the edge of the board and causing it to flip in a downward motion, you want to be moving your feet in an upward motion. Don’t think of it like you're stomping the edge of the board down. Imagine your foot moving out and up, meeting the edge of the board as it moves forward.

, After your board spins and rotates, you want to catch the tail with your back foot to help bring the board level. Your back foot is used to stabilize your board in the air. Catching the board with your back foot will help you to keep the board from spinning any further, allowing you to land safely.

, Though it will take practice, the idea here is to let the front of the board come up to meet your front foot. Once you feel it under you, bring your legs down to land.


Both your front and back feet will hit the board at nearly the same time, but it helps to visualize using your back foot as an anchor or stabilizer and your front foot as the downward force.
During your inward heelflip your feet should never be below your board.

Setup in a kickflip position.,
Pop down the board and start flipping the kickflip.,
When you have your foot catching your board, you want to push it in the shuv it direction.,
It is considered cleaner if you get the entire half kickflip rotation before you do the shuv it.,
Land on your bolts and roll away.

,
If you have trouble landing on your bolts, try jumping higher while you do the trick so that you have more time to get your foot positioning correct.

",How to Hospital Flip," The back foot isn't important, you just need to pop the board and get it out of the way.;
, Try not to flick too hard, and make sure you keep your front foot with your board. A good way to practice this is to do a half kickflip and just catch it with your front foot.

, It is helpful to try to control your board as much as possible here so that you can bring it closer to you if you need it.

, It is perfectly acceptable though to not get the board completely upside down while you are learning it though. Just keep working on it.

Get up some speed.,
Put your back foot in position.,
Get your front foot in position.,
Pop the board straight up.,
Immediately use your front foot to flip the board.When it's vertical, shove your front foot off the side of the board to flip it around in between your legs.,
Land on both feet.",How to Hardflip," Push a few times and gain a little speed to start, because this trick requires a bit of momentum to pull off.






;
, The ball of your back foot should be placed close to the middle of your board, in the same position you use for a kickflip. You should be slightly up on the ball of your foot. Place your foot at a 45-degree angle with your toes pointed toward the back of the board and your heel angled toward the front bolts.









When you do the trick, your back foot will shove forward.

, Your front toes should be positioned at the front edge of the board, with your heel angled toward the back. Rise up so that your weight is on the ball of your foot.









When you do the trick, your front foot will shove off to the side to cause the board to flip.

, Use your back foot to pop the board straight up so that it pops vertically at a 90-degree angle to the ground. You'll do this the same way you would for a frontside shove it.








, So you'll pop and scoop with your back foot like you would for a frontside pop shove it while at the same time flicking strait behind you and also sort of up.









It's important to make sure your front foot gets out of the way after the shove, so the board can flip completely around.
Once you learn hardflips you will want to slowly practice scooping more and more up and out in order to make the board flip as vertically as possible, rather than more horizontally like you would for a frontside shove it.

, When the board completes the vertical part of the flip and is tipping toward the ground, stomp down hard to catch the board and land the trick.









Keep your body over the board the whole time.It can be easier to learn how to land on your front foot, but keep practicing until you can land the trick on both feet.

Practice hard and often.",How to Do a Varial Heelflip," An ollie is one of the most basic tricks to learn on a skateboard and involves taking the board into the air. You will keep one foot on the back of the board and the other in the middle. It is essential to know how to do an ollie before attempting the varial heel flip.Jump up with the front foot and kick down with the back foot at the same time. Then lift up with your back foot and the board should pop into the air. These moves will all happen very quickly.
Bend your knees up to your chest and slide your front foot forward while the board is in the air.
Bring both feet down to flatten the board and land with both feet on the board.;
, The shove it is similar to the ollie except you scoop the board into a turn rather than popping the board up.


Keep one foot at the back of the board and the other in the middle. This is also important to learn before trying the varial heel flip.
Lift up with your front foot and scoop with your back foot. You will need to get the board turning with your back foot by scooping the board backwards.
Allow the board to turn 180 degrees so that the front becomes the back and the back becomes the front of the board.
Land with both feet on the board evenly.

, The frontside pop shove it is very similar to a normal shove it except you will pop the board into the air as you turn the board 180 degrees. Use your back foot to pop the board into the air as you scoop the board backwards like a normal shove it.

, A heel flip involves the board spinning forward in a 360 degree turn. Instead of turning around so the front and back change positions, the heel flip is more like a flip of the board. Learn this before attempting the varial heel flip.


Keep one foot at the back of the board with the other in the middle.
Push down with both feet and pop with your back foot to get the board in the air.
As you lift you should kick forward with your front foot so that the board flips over. At some point the board will actually be upside down so it is important to get enough height so that it can turn all the way around.
Land with both feet on the board over the wheels on each side.

, You may find it easier to attempt this move if you are moving forward slowly. It will also help give you momentum and to land in the correct position.

, Normally you should place your foot into the pocket, or curved edge, of the board.


You want the ball of your foot in the middle of the board or towards the back edge of the board so your heel will be hanging off the edge.

, Your front foot should be slightly above the middle of the board with the toes hanging off.


The length of your toes that are hanging off depends on your personal preferences so do what feels comfortable., Bending down helps you to get additional pop while staying centered will help you complete the trick and land properly.

, You need to get good air for this trick or else you will be unable to complete it., As you pop into the air your back foot will shove the back of the board forward. This completes the frontside shove it motion of your varial heel flip and turn the board 180 degrees.


Because your foot is already towards the back edge of the board you should not need to push hard with this foot to get the board to turn.

, Kick your front foot forwards to catch your heel on the front pocket of the nose of the board. This will create the heel flip motion of the varial heel flip and flip the board all the way around.


This is more difficult than creating the shove it motion so make sure you kick straight out in front of you to catch your heel on the edge.
As you attempt the trick really concentrate on this heel flip with your front foot as this is usually more difficult to produce., As you pop into the air and move your front and back feet to flip and push the board, you will also need to be jumping up and backwards. This trick requires good height so it is important to jump high.


If you are catching the board with your feet while in the air then you may not be jumping high enough.
Many people have trouble with landing too far forward on the board so jumping back will help solve this issue., This gets your feet out of the way of the board, preventing them from knocking the board in the air. Make sure you bring your knees all the way to allow the board space to turn., This will help you to time your landing and bring your feet down at the correct moment, once the board has flipped and turned completely in the air. , Time your landing with the straightening of the board and land with your feet evenly over the front and back wheels. Keep your knees bent to take the impact so that you do not slip out.


If you are landing too far forward on the board then make sure you jump back farther and harder when jumping up into the air.
Many people have trouble with over or under-rotation. If you are over-rotating try moving your front foot a bit closer to the front bolts so that the board does not rotate too much. If you are under-rotating try moving your front foot a little farther from the front bolts to help the board flip faster.
If you are spinning with the board you must try to stay centered and keep practicing.

, This trick can be quite difficult so stay positive and keep practicing. Think about your proper technique and just keep working on the trick. The more you practice the better you will perform and the easier the trick will be for you.

Roll up to the curb at a comfortable speed, with your knees bent, parallel to the curb.,
When you get about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the curb, ollie as high as you can, and lock your trucks on the curb.,
If you were going fast enough, the momentum will push you forward on the curb.,
At this point, push on the tail of your board, and turn slightly to end your grind.

,
Roll away!

",How to Grind a Curb," You may want to try coming at a slight angle to the curb (everybody is different). It's better to go faster, than to go slower.;
, If you came at an angle, you will want to turn in the air so you land on the curb in a 50-50 grind.

, Continue riding the curb until you start to lose momentum.

,,"
"
Find a good small ledge (not a rail) to grind on.,
Make sure you can ollie onto the ledge like a manual pad.,
Try going at a very slow pace and just popping onto the rail.,
When you do go fast a pop on, bend your knees and keep your weight centered over the board.

,
When you reach the end of the ledge (or whenever you want to get off) pop a small ollie and land flat on the ground.

",How to Do Your First Grind on a Skateboard," Ones at your skate park are perfect. these won't need any extra wax, otherwise you could get hurt.;
, You'll be trying a 50-50 grind, in which both trucks slide along the metal plate.

Catch the board with your feet after it spins 180 degrees.,
Roll away clean.,
Kick up your game.",How to Pop Shove It," You should position your front foot in the same place you'd put it if you were doing an ollie, just down from the front bolts, angled out a bit, with your heel hanging off a bit more. Your back foot should be in the toe side pocket of the tail, the place where you start the shove it with your back foot. You should be comfortable on the board before trying this trick.









If you'd like to feel more steady in this position, then you can put your back wheels in a nice little crack that holds your wheels in tight, so your board doesn't roll when you're working on it. This can help you feel more stable if this is your first time doing the trick.;
, Bend your knees just a bit, enough to get some momentum for jumping. This will help you get up in the air for long enough for your board to do a 180. Bend the rest of your body down a bit, too, so your arms hang below your knees. When you pop up, your arms will lift up a bit, too, helping you get some momentum going.









It's up to you whether you want to get a little speed going or to do this flat-ground trick without any momentum. Some people like to do the pop shove it rolling, while others don't. There's no right way to start this trick. It's all about what works for you.

, Now, use your back foot to scoop the tail, just as you would for a shove it, but a bit harder, so that the tail smacks the ground, creating a popping sound. As you lift up, move forward, in the direction that the board is spinning, so you can keep up with it. This should make the board spin 180 degrees in the air. To scoop the tail, your back foot should curl under and go straight back, coming off the board and doing most of the work. The front foot should hover just a bit over the board, helping keep it in place.









When you scoop with your back foot, you should hit the tail hard enough to get it lifted off the board. Think of it as having something on the bottom of your shoe, and trying to scrape it off the ground by moving your foot from front to back. Just remember not to hit the board too hard, or you may flip it over. It takes practice to find the right balance.
In an ollie, the front foot should just slide all the way up the board, for the pop shove it, you want to make sure to lift the foot off the board entirely. Some people like to keep the foot hovering very close to the board, so they can put it down to help guide the board if necessary.

, Watch it spin, using your front foot to guide the board a bit if necessary. Your arms should come up a bit at your sides to help you get up above the board. Wait until the board is at the top of its height before you try to catch it.








, Catch the board with your feet, landing both your feet on the trucks. Land your front foot near the front of the board and your back foot near the tail. Bend your knees when you land, to help you absorb some of the shock.








, Keep your board level to stay centered. Maintain your balance, using your arms to help you out a bit if necessary, as you ride away.








, Once you've mastered the pop shove it, you can try getting the board to spin 360 degrees instead of 180 degrees.

Go with what feels right.",How to Fit Golf Clubs," Clubs are matched to your height and the distance between your hands and the ground. To find the right size clubs for your body, use recent height measurement to determine the proper angle for your clubs. It usually helps to have another person measure, so you get the most accurate measurements possible.Measure your basic height from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet. Stand up as straight as possible to get the measurement. You don't need to be in your swing stance.;
, The other essential measurement that you'll need is the distance between your wrists and the ground. Stand as straight as possible, letting your arms hang loosely at your sides. Ask your helper to measure from the top of your wrist, where the top of the club would be, to the floor.

, If you're considering investing in custom clubs, these two basic measurements will give you specific angle information and a plus-or-minus length requirement based on the standard club length. In other words, height and wrist-floor are the only measurements you need before you head to the store and talk to a salesperson about custom clubs. Typically, size-fitters will work with you to examine your swing on a standard-size club and use your measurements to determine which clubs will be most appropriate for your style of play.


Alternatively, it's good for the fitter to see you swing the clubs you already own and play with regularly to see what might make for a good corrective size, helping to address any inconsistencies in your swing.
Standard size golf club lengths are different for men and women. Each club, from the driver to the wedge, also has it's own standard length, so you must be fit each type.
If you want to do a quick-check of your measurements and get a sense of your plus-or-minus length score, you can plug your numbers in here.

, If you play with a handicap, it can be helpful to provide it when you head to the pro shop to check out clubs. If you're not sure of your handicap, a basic description of your skill level can go a long way in helping the fitter match you with the right kinds of clubs that will help improve your game.


One of the most common reasons for just buying clubs off the rack is that golfers say, ""I'm not good enough for a custom club."" In fact, players with a higher handicap have a game that can be much more drastically improved with the use of custom-fit clubs that help to train the swinging motion properly., When you're sure you've nailed down the proper length and angle of the clubs you need, the next step in the customization process is figuring out what kind of flex and grip works best for your particularly style of play. To do this, most custom fitters will want to watch you swing, but you can also provide some of the basic information necessary yourself to figure out what will improve your game the most.


To determine your swing speed, you'll likely need access to an electronic launch monitor and a radar machine available at most high-end pro shops. It'll be difficult to do at home. In general, though, most amateurs fall somewhere in the neighborhood of 80–85 mile (129–137 km)-per-hour swings.In general, people with faster swings prefer stiff shafts on their woods and iron shafts on the irons. People with slower swings are more likely to prefer flex shafts on the woods and graphite shafts on the irons.

, When you're hitting with your wooden drivers, it's helpful to keep track of your average drive on each different club, which can help to match you with a properly flexed set of drivers. Follow the guidelines below to determine the flex your woods should have.


Less than 180 yards (165 meters), use ladies flex.
Between 181 to 200 yards (166 to 183 meters), use senior flex.
Between 200 to 235 yards (183 to 215 meters), use regular flex.
Between 236 to 275 yards (216 to 251 meters), use stiff flex.
More than 275 yards (251 meters), use extra-stiff flex.

, Determining iron flex will depend on which club you generally use to hit a shot of 150 yards (137 meters). So, in other words, if you were lining up to take a 150 yard shot, which club would you reach for?


If a 4 or 5 iron, ladies flex.
If a 5 iron, senior flex.
If a 6 iron, soft regular flex.
If a 7 iron, regular flex.
If a 7 or 8 iron, firm flex.
If an 8 iron, stiff flex.
If a 9 iron, extra stiff flex.

, A golf glove should fit snugly without wrinkles or creases, working with the grip on the individual clubs to give you the most secure and comfortable contact possible. In general, the larger your glove size, the larger the grip you should use. Grips range from a standard ladies size to an oversized men's grip. The wrong grip can cause friction and disrupt an otherwise perfect swing. Use the pinch test to determine golf glove fit. You should have just a pinch of material at the tips of the fingers and absolutely no pinch in the palm of your hand. Use the size of the properly-fitting glove to get the right grip:


If you use a small or cadet-small glove, use a lady standard grip.
If you use a medium or medium-large glove, use a standard grip.
If you use a large glove, use a mid-size grip.
If you use an extra large glove, use an oversize grip.

, No, you don't have to call up Tiger to get advice. A ""pro"" is a person who works in the golf shop and teaches lessons, the golf equivalent of a personal trainer. It's useful to get a pro to help you learn more about your shots and your needs from a set of clubs. It can be tricky for non-experts to tell whether high and low shots are caused by improper technique or poorly fitted clubs.

, If you're considering investing in a set of custom clubs, it's a good idea to establish a play style and get experienced before investing in a brand new set. Focus on developing a consistent swing, getting your score below the 100s on a standard 18 hole course before you invest the big money sets.


Ask golfing buddies, family, or golf shop employees to let you try different clubs on the driving range. You can predict what you're going to like a little bit based on your height and swing speed, but a lot of it is also personal taste. Choose a standard club to practice.

, The ""loft"" of particular clubs is based on how your shots tend to fly, which is another reason you need some experience in order to be properly fitted. If you notice that you're consistently hitting higher than you'd like, try to go for less loft in your clubs. If you're hitting a bit lower than the ideal range, you might prefer a higher loft.

, Some experienced golfers like to use long irons or hybrids to fill the gap between a 5 iron and your woods. Some people swear by hybrid clubs, while other people prefer the low irons. Only time on the course and range will really tell you what you like and what works best for you.

, There's no ideal size. Even the ""custom"" numbers are less important than what you feel comfortable playing. If you're going to invest in an expensive set of clubs, make sure you enjoy playing with it.


Try out short clubs in various situations from various distances and see what works for your style. Head to any Golfsmith and there will be a small putting area for testing clubs. Try not to get distracted by all of the crazy looking options and focus instead on which ones you're actually getting the ball into the hole with.

",How to Achieve the Proper Grip in Golf," Before you do anything with your hands, make sure that the clubface is square to the target. When you put your hands on first and then move the club face to a square position, you are actually ruining your correct grip and you will have to compensate in your golf swing. A golf swing happens extremely fast, (about 2.5 seconds) so we want to make sure that we have everything correct before we actually start the swing.;
, After you have the clubface square to the target, begin to put your left hand on the club. In order to have the correct left hand grip, have the grip of the club in the root of our fingers, where the fingers meet the palm. The incorrect left hand grip will usually lie too much in the middle of our fingers in the left hand. The reason you'll want the club in the root of the fingers is because the palm creates more of a flat wrist action. The fingers will create a cupped left wrist and that will produce an inconsistent strike on the golf ball.

, The great Jack Nicklaus once said that he wished God had sewn his thumbs to his hand. Once we have the grip in our left hand more towards the root of our fingers, we want to make sure that there is no gap between our thumb and our hand. It should feel as if you were trying to get change out of your pant pocket. Once there is no gap between the thumb and the hand, position your thumb at about 12:30 on top of the grip. As you see in these images, pretend that the, “Golf Pride” on my grip is 12 o’clock.

, Now that we have the sensation of the left thumb and hand sewn together, we now want to make sure that we have a short left thumb opposed to a long left thumb. A short left thumb will allow you to use the bones in your left arm at the top of the golf swing. A long left thumb will be less stable throughout the swing.

, To make sure our left hand is on properly, you should be able to see your index and middle finger knuckles from your point of view. If you see 3 knuckles, then you have gripped the club to strong. If you only see one knuckle, then you have gripped the club too weak. Another checking point to make sure your grip is correct, is the thumb and the hand will create a ""V"" shape. That ""V"" should be pointing at your right shoulder. If it is pointing at your chin, then your grip is again too weak. Weak grips produce weak shots.

, There are three ways to connect your left and right hand. The first way is to have your right pinky overlap your left index finger. The second way, would be to have your right pinky and left index finger interlock with one another. The third way, would be to have all 10 fingers on the club, much like a baseball grip. Try doing either the overlap or the interlock. If you have small hands, go with more of an interlock. If your hands are medium to big, go with the overlap grip.

, The right hand is below the left hand on the grip. Opposite of the left hand, we want the grip to lay more in the tips of our fingers in the right hand. God drew lines on our hands for a reason so lets use them in this step. Lay the handle of the club on the last line of your fingertips. You then want to squeeze the club ever so slightly with those fingertips until the meat of your palm touches the club, (shown in the first picture).

, Once we have the fingers and the meat of the palm touching the grip of the club, we then must suck the right thumb back like a vacuum and fold it over the left thumb.

, Just like the left hand checkpoint, we want to make sure that the ""V"" in the right hand also points to the right shoulder. If the ""V"" points to the correct position, the handle of the club will sit in between the thumb and the right index finger like a saddle at the top of the backswing.

Position your feet properly.,
Skate towards a low curb or rail (about 4 inches off the ground).,
Do an ollie to lift the front of the board just enough to get onto the curb.,
Slide the nose of your board along the curb or rail.,
Dismount the rail/curb with a kickturn.,
Learn how to do an ollie and a kickturn before attempting to do a noseslide.,
Learn how to do a few other skateboarding tricks first.,
Practice doing a nose stall first.,
Work on your balance.",How to Noseslide," Your feet should start in ollie position; back foot near the tail end of your board and front foot around the front wheels. As you noseslide, your feet will move forward about 2 inches as you shift your weight from the back of the board to the front. Imagine jumping and landing with your front foot on the edge of the object you are grinding.






;
, You should use a medium amount of speed as you approach the curb or rail. Your skateboard should be parallel to the curb or rail. Once you're next to the rail/curb, make sure your board is roughly 5 inches away from it, and then do an ollie into your noseslide.








, As you ollie, slide your feet toward the front of your board to shift your weight from back foot to front foot. All of your weight should be on your front foot, which should now be on the nose of your board. You should have no weight on your back foot and your back foot should be placed on the back screws of your skateboard.









Now you must swing your skateboard so that it rides perpendicular on the curb or rail (like a T shape). To do this, rotate 90-degrees once the nose of your board is off the ground. Then land the nose of your board along the rail or curb and start to slide slide., You should use your momentum to slide until you either reach the end of the rail/curb or run out of speed. Your board will not stay on the rail/curb if you put any weight on your back foot, so be sure to keep all of your weight on your front foot. Start this trick by practicing short distances to get familiar with balancing your skateboard during a noseslide.








, You'll do this by shifting your weight back to the tail end of the board and swinging the nose of your board 90-degrees so that it's once again perpendicular to the curb or rail. Then you'll bring your wheels back down.









To shift the weight back to the tail end of your board, move your front foot back about 2 inches and shift some of your body weight to your back foot., You will use elements from these tricks in your noseslide, so it is important that you're familiar with them.









An ollie is the most fundamental skateboarding trick there is, as it's a part of many other tricks. It is usually used to start tricks, as it's basically a jump that gets the skateboard off of the ground. Doing an ollie is necessary in a noseslide, so be sure to learn it.
A kickturn is a basic skateboarding skill, and you'll use it to end your noseslide. Kickturning is when you balance on the tail end of your board for a moment and swing the front of your board to a new direction. Kickturning is typically used to end tricks and turn your board., Though it's not absolutely necessary, it's recommended to learn a frontside 180 and a boardslide before a noseslide. Learning these tricks will teach you some skills that will make performing a noseslide a bit easier. However, it is possible to do a noseslide without learning these tricks first.







, A nose stall is very similar to a noseslide, so being comfortable with a nose stall will make doing a noseslide much easier. A nose slide will teach you how to shift your weight between your back and front foot, a very crucial part of both tricks. Once you've mastered this, you can move on to a noseslide.









A nose stall is basically a noseslide without the slide. Practice by skating up to a low curb or rail and doing an ollie to land the nose of your board onto the curb or rail. This will get comfortable balancing your weight on your front foot and on the nose of your board., When doing a noseslide, you must balance all of your weight on the nose of your board for it to be successful. You need to get comfortable with shifting your weight from the tail of the board onto the nose of the board, and vice verse. You can work on your balance by practicing nose stalls, as they require a shift of balance between the tail and nose of your board.

Memorize the effective range of each iron in your golf bag.,
Consider the lie of the ball.,
Account for wind velocity before pulling an iron from your bag.",How to Choose a Golf Iron," There are also tools such as the Club Choice Caddy or various smart phone apps that will help you with your iron selection based on distance. Irons are designed to propel the ball within narrow distance ranges. You must determine whether your typical stroke with a particular golf iron falls within standard distances for that club. If it doesn't, adjust your iron selection accordingly. Also remember that most amateurs tire after 18 holes, which can have a big impact on club head speed at impact - what might be a 6 iron on the 2nd hole might need a 5 iron by the time you reach the 17th hole. Under normal playing conditions (favorable lie, calm winds), irons can be expected to get the following distances:


2 iron: Optimum range of a 2 iron is 200 yards (182.9 m), or 183 m. The loft angle on most 2 irons is about 19 degrees, meaning the club produces shots with a lower trajectory that sacrifices control in favor of increased distance.
3 iron: Range, 190 yards (173 m). Loft, about 22 degrees.
4 iron: Range, 180 (165). Loft, 26.
5 iron: Range, 170 (155). Loft, 30.
6 iron: Range, 160 (146). Loft, 34.
7 iron: Range, 150 (137). Loft, 38.
8 iron: Range, 140 (128). Loft, 42.
9 iron: Range, 130 (119). Loft, 46.
Approach, or A, wedge: Range, 100 (91). Loft. 52.
Pitching wedge: Range, 25 to 100 (23 to 91). Loft, 48.
Sand wedge: Range, 80 (73). Loft, 56.
Lob wedge: Range, 60 yards (55). Loft, 60.;
, The position of the ball on the course is an important factor to consider before selecting an iron for your next shot. Where the ball as it rests in hazards must be carefully assessed in order to make the right iron selection. Many times, you may decide that the lie dictates 1 or 2 clubs more than you would normally use under typical circumstances. Club substitutions are often made under certain circumstances:


Fluffy lie: This situation often produces increased distance on shots, forcing you to cut back in club length. For example, if you're 160 yards (146 m) from the pin and have a fluffy lie on the fairway, you probably would select a 7 or 8 iron instead of a 6.
Buried lie: Many professional golfers will lay up when faced with this difficult lie, opting for the steep loft angle and controllability of the sand wedge. They accept having to use an additional stroke in order to improve their target to the hold.
Uphill lie: The position of the ball enhances loft naturally, so most players add a club to provide required distance.
Downhill lie: A downhill lie produces a longer, lower shot. Therefore, you usually will want to select a club with a greater loft angle than you would take if you had a clean lie.
Rough: As with buried lies, shots that wind up in the rough can force the player to lay up onto the fairway. Especially in deep rough, control of the shot is imperative. Therefore, most players will select a wedge rather than a standard iron.

, With the exception of the position of the ball, no factor affects club selection more than the wind. Depending on the direction of the wind as it relates to your target, you might have to make a 1- to 3-club adjustment on each shot. In general terms, adjust your club choice by 1 for every 10 miles per hour (16.09 km per hour) of wind velocity.


Headwind: The higher the ball is hit into the air, the more it is affected by the wind. That is because wind speeds are stronger than at ground level. From 160 yards (146 m) out, facing a 20-mph (32.19 kph) wind blowing in from the flag stick, you may need to use a 4 iron to reach the green. Without a headwind, you probably would take your 6 iron out of your bag.
Tailwind: With a breeze behind you, simply subtract the appropriate number of clubs to account for the power of the wind.
Crosswind: Regardless of velocity, this is often the trickiest wind direction to account for. While experienced golfers may be able to hit a draw or fade into the breeze, novice players are best advised to aim toward the prevailing wind, allowing it to carry the ball toward the target.

Buy golf clubs online as it can be a great way to expand the choices you have and save a lot of money versus buying golf clubs at a high end pro shop.,
Know the type of clubs that you are looking for.,
Investigate the website you are looking to buy from.,
There are also many sites out there selling knockoffs or clones of the major name brands.",How to Buy Golf Clubs Online," But, you need to understand the risks of buying online. Aside from the scams and fraudulent site that are taunting us everyday to buy now, you can even have a bad experience from a reputable site. Golf clubs are a very personable thing and one size does not fit all. So before you make that purchase, take a little time upfront so you don't have a big headache in the end.;
, The best way to do that is to visit a local golf shop and try to hit a bunch of the clubs to see what is the best for you. Many of these shops will also provide you a free golf swing analysis. This will also help with the type of shaft, flex, lie and length of the club. Having this information will provide you a better chance of getting the right club.

, Key signs they are a reliable website include:


They have a phone number (800 preferred) and contact information easily available
They are members of the better business bureau
They post a Hacker Safe or similar logo
They take major credit cards through a secure shopping cart
They offer a warranty on their product. Make sure it is posted clearly on their site.
Better yet, they offer some sort of money back guarantee. Since you can't physically see the product, this is advantageous if you get the clubs and they are not what you expected.


, Many of these clubs are excellent alternatives to the name brands, especially when you consider the cost savings. The same principles apply in deciding on the company to purchase from. A money back guarantee is really critical to ensure the product is everything that they say it is.

, Again, visit your local library, used book stores, flea markets and yard sales.


Be on the lookout for books and videos on swing fundamentals and shot making techniques by the likes of Ben Hogan, Ken Venturi, and Jim Flick. These are highly recommended for developing an effective and repeatable swing and will enable you to execute the proper shot when needed. Good choices include:

Focus on obtaining insight on the fundamentals, particularly on:

Grip
Stance
Posture
Ball position before the swing



, Visit your a local seller of used sports equipment such as Play it Again Sports or peruse your local flea market and purchase a few golf clubs to get you started.


Try to find a #5, #7 & #9 iron, perhaps a #3 wood and a putter.
Choose clubs with steel shafts or stiff graphite shafts because these facilitate accuracy.
Make sure the grips are not excessively worn, hard or slick. Otherwise, plan on having them re-gripped immediately.
Any bag will do, but a bag with a built-in stand would be preferable.

, Using the information gained from your books and videos, assume the proper grip, posture/stance and set-up/ball position. Follow the steps you have read about as recapped below:


With club in-hand, place its sole on the floor with its toe very slightly up and its face perpendicular to the imaginary target line.
Remember to stay in balance, arms draped straight down naturally.
Formal instruction is OK, but only if you have a recommendation from a beginner you trust. Otherwise, rely on self instruction until you develop the ability to get the ball airborne. Once you consistently get the ball off the ground and going reasonably straight you can go on to the next level. Do not proceed to the next step, though, until you have achieved a high degree of consistency and moderate accuracy.

, Head to the driving range (practice range) with your clubs, 50 to 100 practice balls, and a handful of tees. Take a towel, some drinking water, sunscreen and a visor or cap if it is sunny and warm. In the beginning, tee the ball about 1/4"" (1/2cm) off the ground for iron shots and 1"" (2-3cm) for the wood. This makes getting the ball airborne easier and helps you build confidence while learning.


Start with the most lofted irons (the highest number irons - wedges, then #9, then #7). Hit a dozen or two dozen shots with each club or until you achieve some consistency with that club before progressing to the next lower number iron.
The #3 wood is generally the most difficult to hit squarely and is the least important at this point.
Focus on the fundamentals and on making solid, square, center-face contact with the ball.
Relax and don't worry about distance.
Don't put too much pressure on yourself. (It's not easy.)
Don't get yourself overly tired. Shorter, more frequent sessions are better. For better results, focus on and master a few fundamentals at a time.
Stick with one club until you master it.

, If you can, find a practice green where it's allowed and do some practice putting. Refine your putting swing (putting stroke). Putting is all about hand-to-eye coordination and feel. Work on:


Balance
Visualizing the ball tracking into the hole
Smooth, short back-strokes and a firm, slightly accelerating follow-through

, Head to the executive course or a short (par 3) course alone or with a close friend who you can trust not to laugh or ridicule and not to give swing instructions. This last is particularly important unless they are a qualified instructor.


Concentrate before and during the shot but relax, enjoy and have fun otherwise.

Work on your putting skills.,
Use soft hands when you chip.,
Pitch with your arms.,
Check the lie of the golf ball.",How to Be a Better Golfer1," The quickest way to improve your score is to work on your short game. If you do not have a lot of time to practice, spending time on your short game is better than spending time hitting long balls.Putting is very important aspect of your short game.


Place ten balls in a circle, three feet from the hole. Move around the circle and try to sink all of the puts. Try to sink ten putts in a row. If you miss one, start over.
Try to practice your putting for fifteen minutes each day. The better you become at putting the more your confidence will increase.You can also start off with two-foot putts and then graduate to three-foot putts.;
, Lightly grip the club to decrease the tension in your arms. Place more weight on your front foot, use your arms and shoulders to swing the club back, and swing downward by pushing your right knee towards your target. Your left wrist should be flat throughout the entire motion.The swing is very short so your right elbow should never be behind your body.
The shaft of the club should always be in line with your left arm. Your left arm controls your chipping swing.Rotate your body forward as you swing.

, Your pitch shot is best when you rely on your arms instead of using your wrists and rotating your forearms. Keep your arms in the shape of a ""V"" as you do this swing.Stand over the ball so that it is right below the left side of your face to start your swing.


Keeping the ""V"" will make your ball have a nice spin and fly high.
Make sure your spine is straight before you begin your swing.

, The way the golf ball sits in the grass affects your shot. Learning how your shot changes depending on the lie of the ball will let you know what shot you should take. Your shot will differ if you are shooting in a thick rough, a bunker, or a tight lie.If the ball is sitting up in tall grass, you may have trouble hitting the ball cleanly. Take a few practice swings and only brush the tips of the grass with your club head. Then hit the ball with a club that has a lower loft (i.e. launch angle of a club, the amount of slope on the face of the club).
If the ball is sitting down in a thick rough, hit down on the ball to get it to come out of the rough.
If you are hitting on a tight lie where the ground is firm and the grass is low, use your putter to hit the shot.
If your ball is sitting on top of the sand, use an open club face to hit the ball or hit behind the ball to get the ball to go a greater distance.
If the ball is sitting down in the sand, your shot will not have any spin when you hit it. If the sand is very moist, use more power for your shot. If the sand is dry, it will be easier to hit the ball.

Line up with one side of your body facing your intended target.,
Position yourself correctly with respect to the tee.,
Spread your legs fairly wide apart, with your knees slightly bent.,
Grip the driver firmly but naturally.,
Tilt your spine to raise your forward shoulder higher than your rear shoulder.",How to Swing a Driver1," If you're right-handed and using right-handed clubs, the left side of your body, particularly your shoulder, should point toward your target. If you're left-handed and using left-handed clubs, the right side of your body should point toward your target.


The side of your body closer to your target is your front side (front arm, front shoulder, front leg), while the side away from your target is your rear side (rear arm, rear shoulder, rear leg).





;
, You should stand so that the ball is ahead of your head. Standing so the ball is even with your head (""on top of the ball"") or behind it will cut into your distance and make it more likely that you will hit the ball offline.

, Your feet should be wide enough apart that the distance between the outside edges of your feet is greater than the distance between the tips of your shoulder blades, with the ball parallel with the inside heel of your front leg. The wider your stance, the wider an arc you can swing a driver in.

, There are 3 ways you can grip a golf club: interlock, overlap and 10-finger grip. Most beginning golfers should probably use either the overlap or interlock grip, with the rear hand lower on the grip than the forward hand. Hold the club so that your hands aren't pressed forward or gripping it at an odd angle behind the club head. You want to have the club face strike the ball squarely instead of at an angle that will cause the ball to veer left or right.

, Your forward shoulder should be about the same height above your rear shoulder as your forward hand is above your rear hand at the club grip. As you lift your shoulder upward, you should shift more of your weight toward your rear leg.


If you have trouble maintaining the proper angle with your shoulders, briefly remove your rear hand from the grip and briefly put it behind your rear knee. This will automatically lower your rear shoulder. You can then put it back on the driver grip again.






Following these steps successfully will cause the head of your driver to strike the ball at a shallow angle and lift it off the tee. Because the tee raises the ball off the ground, you don't need to hit the ball with a downward stroke as you do with an iron or wedge on or off the fairway.

Position your body.,
Swing the driver.,
Perfect your swing.,
Focus on quality of your swings.,
Hit to a target.",How to Be a Better Golfer2," Spread your legs at least shoulder width a part and place the ball in line with your front heel. Place your hands directly above the head of the driver and tilt your back so that your left shoulder is higher than your right shoulder.The wider your stance, the better.
Place a little more weight on your back leg compared to your front leg.

, Form a ""V"" with your hands and rotate your entire upper body. Shift your weight to your back foot and bring your driver back where the head of the driver is over your shoulders and facing your target. Shift your weight from your right foot to your left foot as you swing. At the end of your shot, your club head should be over your head.The power for your shot comes from your lower body. Shifting your weight as you swing will give your shot power.
Hit the ball before you turn your back foot and keep your heels down as you swing.
Keep your head down as you follow through.

, Developing your swing is an ongoing process. Keeping your spine straight is crucial to your swing. Rotate your shoulders and keep your forearms straight as well. Allow the golf club to do the work instead of exerting all of your force to get a powerful swing.Try to make your swing as fluid and smooth as possible. Although there are many movements involved, think of swinging as one single motion.
Your swing will be better if you are relaxed. Take a deep breath and clear your mind before you swing.

, The quality of the shots you hit is more important than the amount of shots you hit. Get a bucket of fifty golf balls and try to make quality shots as if you are on the course. Take a few practice swings before you hit each shot.Swing with your wedge, short iron, hybrid, and driver during your session.
Simulate the order of shots you would take on the golf course. Start with the driver, then short iron, and then your wedge.

, Instead of mindlessly hitting the ball, choose a target for every single shot. Warm up for a little bit and then begin your targeted practice. Ranges usually have landing areas marked with yardages that you can aim for.If you are using your driver, try to land your shot between two sets of the markers. This will simulate the fairway on a golf course.
Vary your targets instead of hitting to the same target each time. This will help you improve your accuracy.

Practice deliberately.,
Work with a coach.,
Stay in the present when you practice.,
Spend more time at the golf course.",How to Be a Better Golfer3," Practicing on its own is not enough. Your practice should be focused, meaningful and individualized. The skills and areas that you practice should be unique to the areas you need to improve in. What scenarios or shots make you nervous or uncomfortable? Those are the areas you should be practicing.Spend more time on the things that you do not do very well versus the things that you excel in.
Your deliberate practice should also be high volume as well. Repeatedly doing the same thing over and over creates memory in your brain.

, A coach can help you refine your skills and evaluate your golf game in a way that you can not do on your own. You are unable to see how you look when you hit the ball. You are only able to see the final product. Whether you hit a good shot or a bad shot, knowing what you did to achieve that result is critical for your improvement.A coach can not only identify any mistakes you make, but also offer adjustments and corrections. You will improve much faster when you have this type of feedback.A coach is helpful for new and established players. Coaches can teach fundamentals as well as tweak the game of experienced golfers., It can be easy to think about your next shot or still be bothered about a shot that you just missed. Instead, focus on the shot at hand. When you step up to the tee, only think about how you want to hit that current shot. Once you have taken that shot, you accept the outcome and then move on to your next shot.Keeping a running tally of your score in your head will distract you from giving each shot 100% of your attention.
It is easier to do this when you are playing well and making shots. When you are not playing well, you may become discouraged and think abut your mistakes. You will have to try harder to focus when things are not going your way.
Talk yourself through your shot. To help yourself focus, ask some questions such as: What club do I need for this shot? Where do I need to make contact with the ball? How should I position my hands?

, The majority of your practice time should be spent playing rounds of golf instead of hitting shots at the driving range. At the driving range, you are only focused on your technique. However, golf is much more than having good technique. Playing rounds of golf will help you improve your scoring and reduce the number of strokes you play per round.The majority of shots you take while playing golf are actually shorter shots and putting.
Only one third of your practice time should take place at the driving range."
"
Watch golf on television.,
Practice visualization.,
Do full body strength training.",How to Be a Better Golfer4," Watching golf is a great way to get better. As you are watching, evaluate what the professional golfers are doing and take notes. Watch how professional players assess each shot before they take it and note the decisions that were made. Look at how each player swings the driver, the wedges, and the putter.Imagine yourself taking the same shot the players on television are taking. Where would you aim for the shot? Compare the choice you made to what the professional player has done.
Try to imitate some of the shots you see at your next practice session.
Good golf players typically have a pre-shot routine (i.e. what they do before they take every single shot). Use the examples of pre-shot routines to help you develop your own routine.Begin to incorporate your routine into your practice sessions.
A pre-shot routine may consist of checking the lie of the ball, checking the distance to your target, checking the direction of the wind, selecting a shot, choosing a club, visualizing the shot, and taking a few practice swings., Visualizing your shots allows you to practice golf from any location. Devote five minutes a day to visualization practice. Focus on the things that you have done well on the golf course. Did you sink a putt? Did you hit a nice long drive?It is important that you make visualization a regular activity. The more consistently you do it, the more beneficial it will be.
Avoid replaying your mistakes when you visualize.

, Increasing the strength of your muscles and bones without bulking up too much will help your golf game. Your strength training program should be focused on lifting heavier weights with fewer repetitions. Choose a weight that you can lift about six or seven times before your body becomes really tired.Try exercises that mimic natural movements and engage multiple muscle groups such as squats and dead lifts.
Aim for four sets, of one to six repetitions. Rest three minutes between each set.

Push the club head away from you at a low angle and begin to shift your weight to the rear leg.,
Swing the driver downward again in a smooth stroke.,
Keep your arms extended as you swing.,
Lift and turn your rear foot after you hit the ball, not before.,
Follow through by folding your front elbow and crossing your rear forearm over your front forearm.",How to Swing a Driver2," Keep your hands in position on the grip and your feet flat. Your leading arm should remain straight on the backswing so that you don't have to remember to straighten it out again on the downswing.

, Keep your feet flat and shift your weight immediately to the front foot. The goal is not to hit the ball as hard as you can, but to swing smoothly through the ball.

, Throughout the backswing and downswing your front arm should be straight for as long as possible. Both arms become straight when the club reaches impact and remain straight for as long as they can.

, As you shift your weight to the front leg, try to keep your back foot on the ground as long as possible, at least until after impact. This motion requires some ankle flexibility. 

, This will increase the speed of your driver's head.


To help you make this part of the upswing, envision your forward arm and the driver's shaft forming a capital ""L"" and your forearms making an ""X"" as they cross






Keep as relaxed a motion through the takeaway, downswing and upswing as you can. Tensing up will cause the ball to veer left or right.

"
Grip the club with your dominant hand on the shaft near the hosel (the part of the club that connects the head with the shaft) with the clubface facing skyward.,
Hold the ball a few inches over the clubface and drop the ball on the face.,
On the next try, let the ball bounce more than once, keeping the clubface directly under the ball.,
After you develop more than a few bounces, move your hand further up the shaft to the grip end like Tiger.,
Learn to stop the ball on the face.,
Try to get the ball to rest on one dimple.",How to Juggle a Golf Ball on a Golf Club,";
, Try to catch the ball after one hop.

, You can maintain the bouncing by slightly pulling up on the clubface while the ball is falling down on it. There is definitely a timing element similar to the old paddle game, so don't practice this anywhere near your golf course or buddies unless you want a new nickname.

, The clubface should point directly to the sky so a glass of water could rest on it. By selecting a club with any angle that is 56°(sand wedge) and above, you will have the largest, flattest clubface in the bag. If you use a driver or other ""wood,"" you can bounce the ball on different sides of the clubface to see the gear effect of spin on a clubface that has bulge and roll.

, This is accomplished by cradling the ball back on the face by reducing the hit on the ball. Angling the clubface and missing the sweet spot can also reduce the bounce. Once the ball begins to stop bouncing, keep the face under the ball and let it settle on the clubface.

, Practice this first without any bouncing. When you can reduce the bounce, the stopping will become easier. Getting the ball to stop is like the marble in the maze game. You have to keep tilting the clubface to keep the ball level and centered. Once it stops, just jumpstart it again.

Find golf instruction that works - Never mind just the latest tip full magazine at the corner store, or one of the hundreds of instruction books available.,
Apply their teaching to your swing - What you'll find are thousands of trial and error test already completed for you.,
Learn the theory behind the recommendation - DO NOT just take someone's word for why to do something.,
Practice, practice, practice - Once you've found a site or instructor to follow and you've begun digging into the faulty areas of your swing and found some things you want to practice, it's time to get to work.",How to Improve Your Golf Swing," This is the internet age! There are very reputable forums and instructors on the internet who are giving valuable content online not for fame but rather for the enjoyment of teaching and the thrill of seeing amateur players enjoy the game. Now more than anytime before you can learn golf online via videos, e-books, forums, etc. You have to invest some time and effort into improving your golf swing outside of just swinging your clubs or hitting golf balls at a range.;
, Many people have gone before you that have the exact same areas in their golf game that is lacking as you. If something is missing in your swing, find out these instructors' take on that element. If you're looking for a complete overhaul, you can easily find their take on the key elements to the golf swing. Do some searching and some reading on the areas of your game you'd like to improve.

, It is imperative that you understand why it is what you're doing. If you're slicing the ball and someone recommends that you ""strengthen your grip"" then you should definitely understand what this is and why it is supposed to work. Only then will you empower yourself to improve your golf swing.

, It could take weeks or months of practice before you are able to ingrain a change into your swing. This is an area where people give up too soon. Don't give up if while practicing you hit the first dozen balls terribly. It takes time to make a change. Just remember that you're investing in your future golf swing.

Place your dominant hand on the club.,
Place the club in your non-dominant hand.,
Secure your off hand.,
Place your dominant hand.",How to Hold a Golf Club1," If you’re right-handed, this is your right hand, and vice-versa if you’re left-handed. Grab the shaft where it connects to the grip and lift the club up at a 45-degree angle.








This isn’t where you will ultimately hold the club with your dominant hand, but it allows you to properly grip the club with your off hand first.;
, This is your left hand if you’re right-handed, and vice-versa if you’re left-handed. Keeping your off hand relaxed and with the palm facing you, lay the grip of the club across the inside of your fingers in the area where your first knuckles and palm meet.









The butt of the club should be extending just past the base joint of your pinkie.

, Curl the bottom three fingers of your non-dominant hand around the grip. Set your thumb flat across the club. You want to roll your thumb over towards the opposite side of the grip, while curling your forefinger around the grip. You should be able to see the knuckles of your index and middle fingers.








If you have secured your grip properly, you should feel every part on the underside of your bottom three fingers making contact with the club’s grip.
You’ll know you have a proper grip when you can feel the base, fatty part of your thumb on the handle, and not overlayed on your forefinger.

, Imagine a clock with the club head pointing at twelve. Curl your fingers over the grip like you did with your other hand. Wrap your pinky finger into the space between the forefinger and middle finger of your non-dominant hand. Point your right thumb toward eleven on your imagined clock, and lay it flat on the grip of the club.








You can also interlock your pinky finger with your forefinger and middle finger if that feels more comfortable or natural to you.

Grip the putter.,
Get in your stance.,
Keep your head over the ball.,
Swing your club.",How to Putt1," Use your fingers to grab hold of the putter handle, with your strong hand lower on the club. That is, if you play right-handed, your left hand should be at the top of the club. Having your fingers grip the handle will give you greater feel for the club and your actions, which creates better control., This is the way you approach (or “address”) the ball and stand over it. Stand up straight with your arms extended forward, holding your putter. Draw your elbows into your rib cage, then bend over until your putter head rests right behind the ball.Make sure you bend your knees slightly. Stiff legs will give you less freedom of movement.
Another way to help your posture while practicing is to find the ideal distance to stand from the ball. Professional golfers stand with their toes, on average, 2.5 putter head lengths from the ball. Try anywhere from 2 to 2.75 lengths when practicing to find the most comfortable distance for you.

, Your posture and stance width can change depending on the green slope, your aim, or various other factors. The important part of your positioning should be that you head is directly over the ball.


If you aren’t sure about your posture, imagine dropping a ball from between your eyes straight down. It should land directly on top of the ball you want to putt. Of course, don’t actually do this during a round., Your swing should be smooth and unhurried. Focus less on striking the ball, and instead push it toward the hole to get a good role. Putting isn’t about power in the same way that shot from other parts of the course are.Keep your shoulders level and wrists firm. When you swing, make sure that all the motion is in your arms. Keeping your shoulders and wrists from moving will give you greater control and accuracy.The speed and distance of your backswing and follow-through should be equal. Pulling your follow through short or long will cause you to lose control of the putt.A wider stance will give you a longer backswing. The farther away you are from the hole, the wider your swing should be."

Try the 10-finger (or baseball) grip.,
Try the Vardon grip.,
Try the interlocking grip.",How to Hold a Golf Club2," To achieve this grip, simply scoot your dominant hand down the grip of the club so that there is no space between the fingers of your two hands. Instead of interlocking or overlaying your pinky finger, you grip the club like a baseball bat.








This grip is often used by novices, players with small hands, and players with arthritis.
The baseball grip can also give you more leverage which can allow you to hit the ball farther.
Note that with this grip you may not get as accurate a shot.
Keep in mind to lead with your hips when swinging and follow with your hands.

, To achieve the Vardon grip, take the pinkie finger of your dominant hand and move it back to lay on top of the fingers of your left hand. It should sit on top of the space between your index and middle fingers.









The Vardon grip is the most common and is the traditional textbook grip.
It is especially recommended for people with large hands, and can be more comfortable for those players than the interlocking grip.
Players with small hands may find it difficult.

, To achieve the interlocking grip, separate the index and middle fingers of your non-dominant hand. Move the pinkie of your dominant hand into this space so that your two hands interlock.









This grip is often recommended for younger or weaker players, but is also used by many golfing greats like Tiger Woods. It works best for players with medium or average hands.
The interlocking grip reduces tension and excess wrist movement, but some players find it uncomfortable.

"
"
Experiment with strong and weak grips.,
Weaken your grip for short game.,
Angle your wrists down for putting.",How to Hold a Golf Club3," A weak grip means the hands are rotated on the club handle more towards your target. If you can only see the knuckle of your forefinger on your dominant hand, you have a weak grip. A strong grip means the exact opposite, with a rotation to the side of your club further away from your target.








A weak grip can combat a hook as well as add height and backspin to the ball. It can also cause the ball to slice, and make proper swinging form difficult to achieve.
A strong grip can be very comfortable and result in good low hits, but it can also make the golfer prone to hooking.

, A looser grip will allow you to gain more precision and loose distance, which you don’t need here. Grip the club as you normally would, and pay attention to where the creases created by your forefingers and thumbs are pointing. These creases should be pointing to the left of your chin, closer to your target.


If you are right-handed, the creases should be pointing to the left of your chin.
If you are left-handed, the creases should be pointing to the right of your chin.
The creases, may also make “V” shapes. You want the point of the “V” pointing closer to your target on your short game.

, When you’re on the green you want to minimize the movement in your wrists. Move the handle of your putter back in your dominant hand so it rests on the lifeline of your palm. Grip it the same way with your other hand. Then, angle your wrists downwards.








Hold your putter with a baseball grip. You don’t need or want wrist movement here. Holding your putter with a 10 finger grip and angling your wrists down helps to keep them locked.
Your putter should be an extension of your arms and swing like a pendulum.

Stand behind the ball.,
Look up the green.,
Focus on the area closest to the hole.,
Find a horizon.,
Focus on the edge of the cup.",How to Putt2," Reading the green means trying to figure out what your ball will do as it travels along the green toward the hole. Start your read by crouching 3 feet behind the ball. Look at the surface of the green, seeing where it dips and rises., If you are facing a putt that is going to go downhill, it can be helpful to read the green by looking “up” towards your ball. Looking down the green can make the hole appear farther away than it is, which will lead to you striking the ball too hard. Stand behind the hole and look towards your ball to get a sense of the downslope., While you want your reading to examine as much of the putting line as possible, you want to pay special attention to the last part of the putt. When you first strike the ball, the break of the green matters less because your ball is moving fastest. As it slows down, the slope will have a greater influence.One way to get a closer look at this part of the green is to stand between your ball and the hole so you can get closer to the area you want to examine.

, When you look over the green, try to find a flat line in the background to judge the green’s slope. This can be anything you see on the course, including eaves and windows on the clubhouse, benches, or bodies of water. This horizontal line will give you a reference point when tracking the break of the green, especially left to right.If you can’t find a natural horizon in the distance, use the brim of your cap or visor. Even more effective can be curling your hands around your face, fingers above your eyebrows, which will help block out your peripheral vision.

, When you start visualizing the break on the green, imagine how you see the ball rolling into the hole. Consider the hole as a clock face, with “12” being the back of the cup and “6” at the front. As you start to address the ball, turn your body so that your putt will aim in that direction.The way edge that the ball will roll into is dependent on a variety of factors, particularly the lay of the green. Use the sloping of the green to inform your prediction of how the ball should fall into cup.

Avoid staring at the ball.,
Use a training aid to keep your putts straight.,
Practice from a variety of distances.,
Be aggressive when putting.",How to Putt3," When putting, your instinct will be to look at the ball to make sure you don’t miss when swinging. Instead of locking onto the ball, focus on a spot an inch or two in front of the ball on the line you intend to putt. This will help you to think about the direction you are trying to go in, which should give you a better focus on the putt itself, rather than just striking the ball., You want your putting motion to be a straight as possible. When practicing, give yourself a guide to help train yourself the correct motion. Lay a stick down perpendicular to your club and behind the head. Practice your swinging motion along this straight line to get the right feel.This is a good tip to help with the basic motion of putting, but this should really only be a helpful reminder.

, Because of the size of greens, you will probably be putting from many distances, including ranges of 30 to 40 feet away. When you get time on the practice green, make sure you try to sink putts from different ranges. This will help you get more familiar with how much power you need for putts of different lengths., When you are on the course, you should try to sink every putt you have, no matter how far it is. Trying to lay one close to or short of the hole is just setting yourself up to do it again, and a putt left short is a stroke lost. Aggressiveness can help you be more confident, especially if those longer putts start going in.


If you go too far, you can always watch the roll afterward to get a quick look at the slope of the green beyond the hole. If you come up short, you’ll have to check that last bit of the green again without the benefit of watching the ball travel along it.

"
Make sure you hit the green, preferably on the upslope as close to the hole as possible.,
As you approach the green glance at the putt from all angles so you know exactly how the putt will break.,
When you get to your ball, mark it and make sure you clean it thoroughly.,
Get down behind your ball and take one last glance at the slope of the green.,
Clear any debris that may affect your ball from getting knocked off the line.,
Relax your shoulders and take a few practice strokes.,
When you address the ball, you should know where you're aimed, the last thing you should worry about it the speed.,
Stand above the ball with a little bend in your knees, and your eyes should be above the ball and you should be relaxed.,
Once you are relaxed, pull the putter back, then make a good stroke on it.,
Watch as your ball rolls in the hole.",How to Make a Putt Under Pressure," You want to give yourself a make-able putt if a tournament is on the line. Aim towards the hole and try to hit your shot onto the upslope because they are easier putts to make opposed to downhill putts. This should become something you naturally do when you approach greens.;
, You should start to do this as soon as you get to the green. Give yourself enough time to know exactly what the putt will do and how hard you will have to hit it. The harder you hit it, the less the ball will break.

, Bring a wet towel to the green and wipe of all the mud on the ball. Also you should make sure there is no fertilizer or dirt on your putter because that could mess up your putt. If there is bring a towel and wipe it off.

, You should know exactly where you want to hit the ball before you address the ball. Speed should be the last thing you worry about. Use the line on your putter to help you line up the ball to where you want to hit it.

, If you need to take a towel or a hat and wipe off the sand or dirt that would stop your ball from going in the hole.

, Take a few deep breaths because you do not want to be tense when you hit the putt. If you have tense shoulders you could mess up your stroke.

, Aim the line on your putter where you want to hit the ball. Keep in mind the harder you hit the ball the less break there will be and vise versa. Once you figure out where you're going to hit the ball figure out how hard you need to hit it for the ball to go in the hole.

, Your ball should be aligned towards your front foot to help the ball roll smoother. If it helps you can use the line on the side of your ball to aim the ball where you want to hit it prior to hitting the ball. If you want to draw a line on the side of your ball with a sharpie.

, Keep your head down to help hit the ball exactly how you want to. If you want to hit the ball harder bring your putter farther back. You should not just simply swing harder at the ball because it is not as consistent.

, Give a little fist pump and there you have it, you just made the putt to win the tournament. Now all you have to do is go sign you scorecard. You just won the tournament, all because you made that last putt on the last hole.

Practice.",How to Hit a Golf Ball," Woods will give you the greatest distance and are typically used when you need to make a shot from a distance between 200 and 350 yards (183 and 320 m).Even though woods were once made of wood, nowadays, they are usually made of steel, titanium, or other metal alloys.
Woods can be separated into two broad subcategories: drivers and fairway woods.
A driver is also known as the ""1 wood."" It will give you the greatest distance possible.
Fairway woods are your 3, 5, and 7 woods. The higher the number, the more loft your shot will get and the shorter the distance will become.;
, If you are not within putting range but the green is less than 200 yards (183 m) away, an iron is usually the best club to choose.


Irons tend to be a little heavier than woods and have a greater loft than woods have.
Your irons will be numbered 1 through 9. The long irons are 1, 2, and 3 irons, and they have greater distance yet minimal loft. The middle irons are 4, 5, and 6 irons, and these tend to be used when the ball is 150 to 170 yards (137 to 155 m) from the green. Short irons are the 7, 8, and 9 irons.
There are two basic types of irons: cavity backs and blades. Cavity backs are easier for new golfers to use, while blades tend to be more difficult.

, The shape is similar to that of a wood, but the loft and distance is similar to that of an iron, so hybrids are usually used as replacements for irons.


Usually, 3 and 4 irons are the ones most frequently swapped out for hybrids.

, A wedge can give you a loft between 46 and 64 degrees. These clubs are usually used when you need to clear a hazard within a fairly short distance.


Technically speaking, wedges are a type of iron. They have the same basic appearance and build, but wedges are usually designed to produce a greater loft.
Wedges also have ""bounce,"" which is the angle between the leading edge to the bottom of the sole of the club. As a result, it is easier to get the club to bounce off the ground instead of digging into it.
There are several types of wedges, but the most common include the pitching wedge, sand wedge, gap wedge, and lob wedge.The pitching wedge lofts between 44 and 50 degrees. Use it on fairways and for chip shots around the green.
Sand wedges are used for sand traps. They loft between 55 and 59 degrees.
Gap wedges fill the distance gap between pitching and sand wedges and usually loft between 51 and 54 degrees. You will get greater distance with a gap wedge than a sand wedge, but less distance than you would with a pitching wedge.
A lob wedge lofts between 60 and 64 degrees. Use a lob wedge if you need to get the ball over a bunker, water hazard, or other hazard and need to do so over a very short distance.



, Once you reach the green, switch to a putter to help you land the ball in the hole.


The club face of a putter is flat and small. As a result, you can gently tap the ball more easily without causing loft or creating much distance.
You should always use a putter if you are on the green, and you may even need to use it if you are just a little ways off the green, as well.

, A tee shot is the first shot you make. Use a driver or an iron to hit the ball off the tee and in the general direction of the green.


Use a driver for long holes or an iron for short holes.
Tee shots for long holes need to have shallow height but a long flight path, while tee shots for shorter holes need to fly higher and stop quicker.

, Fairway shots are made from a long to mid-range distance and are usually made with a fairway wood. Playing from the fairway can be difficult, though.


When you are playing on a narrow fairway or when the green is approaching, switch to an iron, which will give you better precision and less distance.

, A bunker shot refers to the type of shot you need to make in order to get yourself out of a sand trap.


To make a good bunker shot, choke down on the club with your right index finger 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the grip. This will give you greater control of the club.
Narrow you stance and play the ball a big more forward than usual.
Dig into the sand with your feet and keep your body still. Swing with your arms, and make the swing vertical with the grip butt pointing and the ball during your backswing. Your left arm should be parallel to the ground.
Focus on hitting the sand 1 inch (2.5 cm) behind the ball on your downswing.
The idea is to get a steep angle to lift the ball out. Distance is not the aim here., #Putt around the green. Once you get the ball to the green, you need to switch your club to a putter and tap the ball toward the hole.


Change your grip for a putt. Place your hands on the grip in a way that focuses the energy of the shot in your shoulders and arms, rather than in your hands. You should only move your shoulders and arms for a putt. Do not move your hands and wrists.
Keep your head still.
Visualize the line your ball needs to travel to reach the hole before making your putt. This shot needs to be a little more precise than many of the others.
Your backswing and downswing should take the same amount of distance and time to make., Approach shots give you greater distance than a putt but less distance than a mid-range shot. The most common types of approach shots are pitches, flops, and chips.A pitch is a high approach shot that forces the ball to fly high and roll very little upon hitting the ground. Make it with a pitch wedge.
A flop gets even more height and stops almost immediately upon hitting the ground. This shot is usually used to play over obstacles on the green. Use a sand wedge or lob wedge for this type of shot.
A chip is a low shot, also called a low punch. The ball gets very little height and gently rolls onto the green. Play it off the back of the foot farthest from the target, and use a wedge or a short iron for this type of shot.

, A straight shot can be incredibly difficult to master because you must give the ball no sidespin as you hit it.


In order to do this, the club face must be perfectly square to the ball at the moment of impact. Your swing plane, or the angle your club approaches the ball from, must also be square with the ball.

, Each of these shots produce slight to dramatic curves, which can help get the ball closer to the green if it strays too far.


A fade is a mild curve from left to right. They tend to be easy to produce, and they roll less upon landing than many other types of shots. Produce a fade with an open club face or but drawing across the ball from the outside to the inside upon impact.
A draw is a mild curve from right to left. They tend to be more difficult than fades, but they can give you greater distance and more roll. Closed club faces produce draws, or you can cut across the ball from the inside out as you strike it.
A slice is a large curve from left to right. A hook is a large curve from right to left. Both do not travel far and tend to go out of control, so they are usually avoided. If you cut across the ball too severely when you strike it, you will get a slice or a hook.

, You need to stand with your dominant leg facing forward so that your dominant arm can control the direction of the club more readily.


Your legs should be shoulder-width apart.
Keep your legs, torso, and shoulders square with the ball.
Grip the club tightly enough to keep it secure in your hands, but keep your hands tension-free.
You should maintain the angle of your dominant hand throughout the entire stroke.

, A drive will need more force than a putt, so you need to make sure that the amount of force you apply to the ball is proportional to the amount of distance you need.


No matter what, the start of your downswing should be calm. Build up speed gradually before striking the ball.
If you need more power, you should shift your weight backward on your backswing. Do not do this if you are only trying to putt or tap the ball, though.

, If the wind is particularly strong when you play, you will need to adjust your shots accordingly.


When playing into the wind or in cross winds, give your ball less spin. Widen your stance, play the ball further back, and grip down on the club. You should also swing easier rather than swinging harder.
If you are playing downwind, focus on getting height into your shots over distance.
If putting into the wind, you need to have a wider stance and more bend at your waist. The putt will have a tendency to move in the same direction as the wind, so adjust it accordingly to prevent the ball from straying too far to one side.

, As with anything else, practicing your golf game is the best way to get good at it. Do drills to help familiarize yourself with different clubs and shot types, and experiment on your own to find techniques that feel comfortable and natural while producing consistent results.

Take the club in your left hand.,
Arrange the fingers of your left hand.,
Orient your right hand with your pinkie finger.,
Add your remaining fingers to the grip of the club.",How to Grip a Golf Club1," The head of your golf club should rest on the ground while you are positioning the starting grip of your left hand. The grip of the club should rest across the palm of your left hand. The heel of your hand, where it connects to the wrist, should be even with the end of the handle.


If you find holding the end of the club even with the heel of your hand uncomfortable, you might improve your grip by leaving ¼"" (.64 cm) of the handle extending beyond the heel of your hand.;
, With the club still resting across your left palm and the heel of that hand even with the end of the club's grip, wrap your fingers around the grip. Your fingers should have no space between them, and your thumb should be lined up with the shaft.


The last three fingers (pinkie, ring, and middle) of your left hand will form the foundation of your grip. These fingers should be firm against the club.
The knuckles of your pinkie, ring, and middle fingers should be mostly visible while gripping the club in this fashion, when viewed from the side of the club opposite your left hand., Your pinkie finger will serve as the anchor for the grip of your right hand. You should place your right pinkie finger so that it fits snugly between the knuckle of the forefinger and middle finger on your left hand., Curl the remaining three fingers of your right hand around the grip so there is no space between your fingers. The thumb of your right hand should be positioned over the thumb of your left hand, so they are both in alignment along the length of the shaft.


Your hold on the club should be firm, but relaxed. Gripping the club too tightly can hinder your swing, while gripping too loosely may cause the club to fly free of your hands while swinging."
"
Hold the club with your left hand.,
Connect your right hand to your left with your right pinkie.,
Complete the grip of your right hand.,
Lay both thumbs atop the shaft.",How to Grip a Golf Club2," The head of the club should rest on the ground as you adjust your hands in the proper positioning. Take the grip of the golf club in the palm of your left hand so that handle lies across your palm and the heel of your hand matches up with the end of the handle. Then curl the remaining fingers of your left hand around the handle so your fingers are positioned directly next to each other.The interlocking grip is often recommended to golfers with small hands. If your hands are on the smaller side, this grip might be best for you., Align your right hand so it is slightly lower than your left on the club. Try not to complicate your grip at this point by adding fingers aside from your right pinkie to the grip. Allow the palm of your right hand to rest against the handle. Then, interlock your right and left hand by putting your right pinkie underneath the forefinger of your left hand.You can often tell your grip is too tight when you feel discomfort in the overlapped pinkie/forefinger. If you feel this sensation, you should relax your hold on the club.

, The fingers of your right hand can now be added to the grip. They should curl around your club firmly so that your fingers are arranged one after the next without gaps in between., Much like the overlapping grip, your thumbs should align to follow the shaft of the club. Your end grip should have both hands holding the club as a single, interconnected unit."
"
Take the club in your left hand.,
Curl the fingers of your left hand around the club.,
Place your right hand below your left hand on the grip.,
Add your remaining fingers to the grip.",How to Grip a Golf Club3," Rest the head of your club on the ground. Much like standard club grips, you should first hold the grip of the golf club in your left hand. Your left palm should be facing up, and the grip should lay across your palm. The end of the club's handle should end evenly with the heel of your hand.


The baseball grip is especially recommended if you find the overlapping or interlocking grip uncomfortable.
The baseball grip is often recommended to children, senior citizens, and women to provide greater leverage in the swing. However, this grip can cause issues with form, like flipping at the end of the downswing., With the baseball grip, all the fingers of your left hand will wrap around the club, unlike other grips where your thumbs align with the club's handle. Hold the club loosely with your left hand fingers gripping in this fashion, with each finger, including your thumb, curling around the handle., Your right hand should be directly below your left, with the club resting loosely in your palm and only your left hand fingers curled around the handle. Your left thumb should touch the meaty part of your hand connected to your right pinkie., Curl your right hand fingers around the club. The thumbs of both hands should also wrap around the club handle, with your left thumb pushing slightly into the meaty part of your right hand connect to your pinkie. This grip is very similar to the standard baseball bat grip."
"
Take your putter in your right hand.,
Wrap the fingers of your right hand around the shaft.,
Link your left pinkie to your right hand grip.,
Add the remaining fingers of your left hand to the grip.",How to Grip a Golf Club4," But first rest the head of your putter on the ground. Unlike most standard grips, the cross-handed grip begins with your right hand. With your right palm facing upwards, allow the club to rest across your right palm so that the heel of your hand and the end of the club are even.The cross-handed putting grip is especially effective and assisting with an even putting stroke. If you have difficulty with even strokes in your putting, this grip is recommended., Your right hand, at this point, should be loose and your right thumb should be in line with the handle of the putter. Your fingers should be arranged closely together so there is no space between them., Your left pinkie finger will need to be sandwiched between the knuckle of your right forefinger and middle finger. Keep the remaining fingers of your right hand loose and uncurled around the handle. You'll first want your left pinkie link to your right grip with a hold that is comfortable, yet firm., The remaining three fingers of your left hand will curl around the handle. Your left thumb should lay atop the thumb of your right hand. Both thumbs should follow the length of the shaft of the club so both are in alignment with it.


Holding the club in this fashion will help keep your left wrist firm as you putt. This will encourage more even putting.
The cross-handed grip can look or feel awkward while you are getting used to it. It may take you some time before it becomes natural."
"
Mirror right handed form if you are left handed.,
Rate and adjust your grip strength.,
Maintain clean, straight angles in your form.",How to Grip a Golf Club5," Left handed golfers can achieve a good grip on the club by reversing these instructions so they are mirrored. For example, instead of starting off holding the club with your left hand, you would instead take the club in your right hand., Rate the strength of your grip from 1 - 10, with one being your weakest grip and 10 being your strongest. The kind of grip you should generally use when holding your club at about a 5 or 5½.Don't grip the golf club too tightly. You should hold it like a firm handshake. A tighter grip doesn't make a more powerful shot, it will only restrict your ability to take a full swing.

, A slight bend or angle will drastically affect your swing, especially on long shots and putts. When putting, even small deviations will be increased by irregularities in the terrain and can cost you strokes.


When holding a putter, make sure your forearms and the shaft of the club form a straight line towards the ground."

Start with your front foot slightly ahead of the ball.,

Remember to follow through.,
Don't try to pummel the ball with all your strength — easy does it!,
Correct the slice.,
Correct the hook.,
Correct swings that don't hit the ball ""squarely.""",How to Swing a Golf Club," Place your feet so that your front foot is slightly ahead of the ball; this way your club will be resting near the middle of your body. Your feet should be a little wider than shoulder width apart.


Play your bigger clubs (such as hybrids or drivers) more towards your front foot, and smaller clubs (like irons) towards your back foot.
If you're a right-handed player, your left foot will be about one foot — often less — closer to the hole than the ball is.
If you're a left-handed player, your right foot will be closer to the hole than the ball is.;
, Don't stand so close to the ball that you have to bend your elbows to accommodate the club positioning. At the same time, don't stand so far away that your arms are fully outstretched. You want your upper body to be slightly bent toward the ground, but not dramatically so. Tilt your upper body slightly away from your target. , Alignment is the direction your feet and shoulders are pointed in. You want to align your feet and shoulders so that an imaginary line passing from your back shoulder to front shoulder — and back foot to front foot — is pointed directly at your target. This is called keeping your alignment ""square.""To check your alignment, get into your stance and place a golf club on the teeing area along the tips of your toes. Step back from the golf club and look at the direction it's pointing in. It should be pointed either at your target, or at the hole itself.

, Instead of being a stiff mannequin, try to adopt an ""athletic stance"" by bending your knees slightly. Try a practice swing with your knees totally straight to see how hard it is — and how unnatural it feels — to swing a golf club without slightly bent knees.


Balance your weight on the balls of your feet.Although this is more difficult than balancing your weight on your heels, it is easier to shift your weight forward, and then backward, as you perform your swinging motion.
Distribute your weight evenly on both your feet. Move the heels of your feet off the ground slightly in quick succession to get a feel for an even stance. Although you'll shift your weight during your backswing, and then your downswing, you'll want to start off with an even weight distribution.

, A relaxed grip will allow the club head to turn over when you swing, giving you better accuracy and usually better distance. As with most things in golf, the harder you try, the worse things get. Try to keep it natural.

, This is a very basic grip similar to how baseball players hold a baseball bat, hence the name. Note: For all three of the following grips, the left hand (on a right-handed golfer) will be in the same position.


Place your left hand underneath the golf club, curving your fingers over the club so that they grip it securely. The golf club should be resting right where your palm meets your fingers; your left thumb should be pointed straight down the club to the club head.
Bring your right hand underneath the golf club so that your right pinky finger is comfortably touching your left index finger.
Tighten your grip on the top of the club so that the right portion of your palm rests on top of the left thumb. Your right thumb should be pointing slightly left-of-center, while your left thumb should be pointing slightly right-of-center.

, While there's nothing wrong with the baseball grip, the fingers are essentially disconnected from one another. The overlap grip connects the fingers by overlapping them. This grip offers somewhat more stability.


Start off with your hands in the baseball grip. Instead of keeping your right pinky and your left index finger side-by-side, move your right pinky up and rest it either on the joint between the left index and the left middle, or on top of the index finger itself.

, This grip offers probably the most stability of the three by interlocking the left and right hands on the underside of the club. This grip is used by golf greats Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.To achieve the interlocking grip, start off with the baseball grip. Next, fit the left index finger between the joint of the right pinky and ring fingers while taking the right pinky and fitting it between the left index and middle fingers. Your right pinky and left index are essentially holding each other in an interlocking ""x.""

, Every grip has its distinct advantages and disadvantages, and there are many more grips that we haven't mentioned — weak or strong grips, etc. Experiment with golf grips until your swing feels most comfortable and you fix some of your worst tendencies.


The interlocking grip, for example, is commonly prescribed for golfers with small hands (think Nicklaus), while the overlapping grip is hard for people with smaller hands to use.
If you're having problems with a slice (ball moves left and then dramatically right for right-handed golfers), consider switching away from the ""weak"" grip if you're using it.If you're having problems with a hook (ball moves right and then dramatically left for right-handed golfers), consider switching away from the ""strong"" grip if you're using it., The backswing is where you lift the club from its starting position and bring it above your head. Try to rotate the torso on the backswing by shifting weight from the ball of your front foot to the ball of your back foot. Pay attention to the three distinct phases of the backswing:


Phase one: Move the hands straight back while keeping them close to your back leg. Try to keep your front arm straight while you do this. As the club head hinges backward, the shaft of the club becomes almost parallel to the ground.
Phase two: Continue a slight wrist break as you move your arm parallel to the ground. The club should be roughly perpendicular to your left arm (for right-handed golfers). The end of the club should be pointing slightly outside the golf ball.
Phase three: Rotate your torso back even further so that the club head travels slightly behind your hands at the top of the backswing. Your front arm should bend slightly during the last phase of the backswing.

, When swinging down, ""haul"" the head of the club so that it lags behind everything else, and allow the 90 degree forearm/shaft angle to increase, then unwind rapidly through the impact area. This creates tremendous club head speed while allowing the body to move relatively slowly and maintain control.


Right before impact, try to lock your front arm again so that it's completely straight again, just how it was when you started your backswing.
Shift your weight from the ball of your back foot to the ball of your front foot. Allow your knees to move toward your target. Try to keep your front knee flexed, especially if you're hitting a driver.

, This will help to have the face of the club face square at impact, an important factor in directional control. Don't forget to use your hips to swing energy into your shot; don't just rely on your hands to produce the power.

, It isn't critical how far back you take the club, but if you release the club correctly, you should follow through completely. Your belt buckle will be facing the target, the club will be behind you, and you will be balanced on your lead foot with the back foot balanced on its toe. You should be able to comfortably hold this finish as you watch the ball fly off into the distance.



Keep your eyes on the ball during the backswing, downswing, and follow through. Don't lift your head as soon as you hit the ball to see where it's going; this will only cause you to mis-hit the ball. Keep your eyes on the ball until you've finished your follow through.

, Just as you shouldn't try to strangle your golf club in your grip, you shouldn't try to pound the golf ball with all your strength. The most important factor in achieving distance and direction is form, and good form is usually sacrificed when you try to go caveman on the golf ball.

, If your ball is traveling to slightly the left (for a right-handed golfer) and then dramatically to the right, try to keep your knees bent and flexed during the backswing.It's natural to want to straighten out your back knee during the backswing, but try to avoid the impulse. Don't let your knee travel backward either; keep it flexed in position and underneath the hip., A hook is a ball that travels slightly to the right (for a right-handed golfer) and then dramatically to the left. This happens when the ball has a counterclockwise spin, meaning that it's being hit from right to left instead of from back to front.

Try looking at your grip. If more than two knuckles on your left hand are visible when you hold the club, turn to a ""weaker"" grip and make sure only two knuckles are visible.
Make sure your stance isn't aiming too far to the left. You can try to overcompensate a little to the right, but this can also make the hooking motion worse if you overcompensate too much. Place a golf club down on the ground to make sure you're aiming straight at your target.

, Sometimes your swing is ""fat,"" others it's ""thin,"" and your drive doesn't get as much distance as you'd like. The most common remedy for this problem is keeping your head down and your eye on the ball throughout the backswing.

When you move your head back in the backswing, you're actually increasing the distance between the base of the neck and the bottom of the ball.This makes it much tougher to hit the ball right in your wheelhouse. Keep your eye on the ball and you should be driving longer and more consistently.

Keep the toe of the club in front of the heel of the club.",How to Hit a Draw or Fade1," Hitting a draw means hitting the ball to that, for a right-handed player, the ball curves slightly from right to left. Employing what's called a strong grip will help you do this. Weak grips tend to cause fades, while strong grips encourage draws. In order to hit a draw:


Place your left hand on the top of the grip, with your wrist turned in to your body, so that some knuckles are showing.
Place your right hand below of your left hand, covering your left thumb, with the crease in your right hand angled to your right shoulder. Your palms should face each other.

Note: Rolling your right hand over the club is what ""weakens"" the grip, causing a slide or fade. If you can see the knuckles in your right hand, you're weakening your grip, making a draw harder.;
, Point your feet and shoulders so that they are aimed slightly to the right of your intended target, but aim your shot right at the target. This is called a closed club face.When you hit the ball, it should start out right of its initial target, curling back to the left the closer it gets.
Some golfers prefer dropping their front shoulder, believing that more of an upward trajectory on the ball contributes to a draw.

, What does this mean? When you set up your feet and shoulders, draw an imaginary line that both your feet and shoulders are pointing to. On the takeaway, keep your swing low and on the inside of this imaginary line. Try for more of a rounded swing than a vertical swing.

, When your club begins to come down, try to straighten out your right arm. This will create good club head speed, promoting a right-to-left path in the flight of the ball.


As you do this, keep your right shoulder back for as long as possible. This, in combination with a straight right arm will help the club face close on time, creating a draw.

, As you hit the ball, try to make sure that the toe of the club is in front of the heel; as you continue your follow-through, the toe of the club should travel farther in front of the heel than it was when you made contact.


To do this, the right arm will cross over the left arm as you make contact with the ball. This will create the signature draw arc.

Avoid thinking of things that could go wrong, and instead focus on everything going right. Imagine the perfect shot in your mind’s eye.;
, Take your time when setting up to hit the ball to ensure you have proper alignment. You should also ensure your ball is properly aligned between the left heel and the center., Imagine a line between the ball and the flag and put your clubface square to the line. Stand parallel to the line for the perfect golf swing., If you are stance is off, your shot will be off. Ensure that your feet are shoulder-width apart. Keep your feet, knees, hips, and shoulders parallel to the imaginary line leading to the target. Your right foot should be at a right angle to the line of flight, while the left foot should be slightly open., Your body weight should not be in the heels, but on the balls of your feet. This will allow you to easily twist your back foot as you complete the downswing. Ensure your weight is evenly distributed between both feet., The lower your hands are, the lower the ball will fly. Keep your hands low in the finish to reduce the height of your follow through., If you are right-handed, your right forearm should be parallel to your spine in the backswing. Your left wrist should be straight and your elbows and arms should form a tight triangle., Begin with a standard grip and twist your bottom hand so that it faces away from you in the backswing. Keep it facing away from you the whole swing, as if you are wiping your palm across a flat surface., Create the K by bending forward from the hip sockets and back from the knees. Flexing your back leg correctly aligns the joints on top of each other and creates room for your arms to swing., Keep simple statistics of your golf games to identify what you are having trouble with. You can even use a website such as Shot by Shot, or an app like Golf Stats, to help you electronically track your rounds. This will help you learn what areas you need to improve on to get the perfect golf swing., Avoid looking at the flag, the club, or other parts of the course when you are taking your shot. Keep your head down, focus on the ball, and let your body naturally complete the swing., Flippiness is an early release that occurs when your body gets too far in front of the golf ball. Establish a firm left side to keep your head behind the ball and avoid the flip., You should rotate your torso rather than your arms and wrists to get power and speed behind your shot. On the upswing, rotate your torso away from your target so your left shoulder is over your right leg rather than your left. On the downswing, rotate your torso toward your target so that your right shoulder is over your left leg., Sometimes players will unknowingly hold their breath through the downswing. This actually reduces the distance of your shot. Exhale on the downswing to relax your muscles and allow your body to give the swing your full force."

Use about half of the tees length.
Teeing too high or low will alter your drive.

, Stand so that your golf ball is only a few inches behind your left toe. Placing the ball here will result in less swing range and more control.


Setting the ball back further in your stance will diminish power.
Putting the ball further ahead in your stance will reduce accuracy.

, Stand just wider than shoulder width. Taking a narrow stance will constrict your range of motion and grant more control.


Don't take too short a stance as this will drastically alter your swing.

A fade can easily turn into a slice if you move your grip too much to the left.Make sure your left hand is on top of your right hand for as long as possible. Hold your club face square to your release path, or even open to it.

, A fade is where the ball starts off left and slowly drifts back to center. To make sure your fade doesn't become a slice, aim slightly left of target with your feet and shoulders.

, On impact, hit the ball so that the toe of the club is tilted slightly rearward and the heel is in front of the toe.This will promote the left-to-right movement that you're looking for with a fade.

, Swinging really hard with an open swing encourages a slice. So don't kill the ball. Swing evenly so that your hands don't turn over., A lower height on the teed-up ball will help you swing more level at impact.

Be careful when putting your weight over the wheels.,
Use the grip tape for traction.,
Avoid the tail and nose of the board.",How to Stand on a Skateboard," There are two common stances used in skateboarding: regular and goofy. In a regular stance, the left foot is situated at the front of the board, whereas in a goofy stance the right foot is up front. Determine which stance is more natural for you by considering whether you’re right or left handed. Most right handed skaters ride in a regular stance. In the end, you should do what feels most comfortable to you.Give both stances a shot and see which one you prefer.
If you’re still not sure which stance is best for you, picture yourself on a moving skateboard approaching a ramp, about to bust out a gnarly trick. Which foot do you have forward? Whatever you imagined automatically is likely your most comfortable natural stance.;
, Start on flat ground; don’t worry about the skateboard at all right now. Place your feet directly under your shoulders and assume a natural stance. In this position, your weight should be evenly distributed over each leg. This will provide you with maximal balance and control over the board.Practice shifting your weight back and forth between each leg while keeping your body aligned and your head centered and upright. This will prepare you to settle into position of stability on the board.

, Bring your butt down slightly and bend your knees a little. This will center your weight in your hips rather than higher up on your body the way it is when you’re standing normally. With a lower center of gravity, you’ll be less likely to come unbalanced once you’re on the unstable board.Loosen up. It’s harder to make corrections when you’re rigid.
Don’t crouch or sink too deep. You just want to be low enough to create a solid base.

, Turn your chin so that you’re facing the direction you would be going if the skateboard was in motion. If you favor a regular stance, this means you’ll be looking over your left shoulder; goofy riders will look to the right. You’ll be able to focus your sight on the ground ahead of you to spot obstacles and ready yourself for tricks, and the position of your feet will also fall within your peripheral vision.There’s a natural tendency to look down at your feet while you’re trying to keep your balance. Remember, however, that where your head goes, your body follows. Stay lined up and get used to looking a few feet ahead of the board.

, Place one foot on the skateboard and make sure you’ve got solid footing. Then, quickly and cautiously lift the other foot and set it down beside your first foot. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, the way you practiced. Once you’ve gotten on the board successfully, the hardest part is over!Don’t go too fast or too slow. If you hurry, you might cause the board to shift unintentionally. If you take too much time, you could throw yourself off balance standing on one leg. Aim to step up with an easy 1-2 pattern, with about the same pace that you would walk up stairs.
You’re most likely going to fall a time or two as a beginner. Don’t let this discourage you. After you’ve taken a spill, your fear of falling will begin to fade and you’ll be able to better commit., A good rule of thumb when you’re first getting comfortable with standing on a skateboard is to stay centered over the trucks. The trucks are the long metal shafts on the underside of the board that attach the wheels to the deck (the wooden platform you stand on). Rest each foot over the bolts on the top of the board that hold the trucks in place. Don’t let your feet spread out too far or come together in too narrow a stance.Conveniently, the distance between the trucks is approximately the same as your feet when in a shoulder width stance.

, Lean your weight forward slightly until you’re poised on the broad part of your foot directly behind the toes. When you’re skating, you need to be able to shift and reposition to stay balanced and perform different maneuvers. Staying on the balls of your feet makes it easier to lift, slide, and pivot your feet at will, and will also allow you to absorb shock through your lower leg muscles while you’re riding.


Standing flat footed on a skateboard feels awkward because it essentially takes all agility out of the equation. When you’re on the balls of your feet, you’re ready to respond to the movements of the board.
Raising up on tiptoe or letting your heels come off the board will also compromise your balance. Your entire foot should remain in contact with the top of the board; it’s just a matter of where your weight is directed.

, Use delicate movements of the feet, ankles, knees and hips to maintain your balance on the board. Lean, tilt, pump your legs and do whatever else you have to do in order to stay upright. You can even wave your arms to steady yourself, if it helps. You should constantly be making small adjustments to keep the board under control, especially once you’re in motion. It will continue to get easier the more you practice.If your feet and body are fixed in place, you will almost always come unbalanced.
Try not to sway too far forward or backward. You might fall off or even tip the board over.
Balancing on a skateboard is similar to standing on the deck of a boat that is rocking, pitching and swaying. It forces you to stay light on your feet.

, Set the board down in a patch of grass or on some thick carpet to make sure it doesn’t roll while you’re first learning how to stand on it. A softer surface will prevent the wheels from rolling and causing the board to come out from under you. Get comfortable balancing on the board somewhere stationary before graduating to the asphalt.You should ideally be fairly comfortable climbing on and off a skateboard that’s resting on carpet or grass before you attempt to move to a harder surface.
Not only will soft terrain lock the board in place, it will also hurt less should you happen to fall.

, As you step up, do so one foot after the other in a quick, smooth, controlled manner. Beware of rocking the board too far in either direction. Since this is the same action that propels the board, you can easily lose your center of gravity and send the board, and yourself, flying.It can help to remind yourself not to lean too far in any direction when stepping up.

, Try getting the basics down on a skateboard that’s covered in a layer of grip tape. Grip tape is a type of adhesive surface similar to high-grit sandpaper that is designed to increase a skater’s traction. This added traction offers you greater control over the board. You’ll be able to progress at a faster rate if you don’t always have to worry about missing your footing.If you don’t have the benefit of grip tape, at least make sure you’re wearing grippy shoes and be extra aware of what you’re doing when you have to move your feet.

, On either end of most types of skateboards there is an upturned edge known as either the “tail” or the “nose.” Leave these alone for now. Putting too much weight on the nose or tail will cause the board to lift up, raising one set of wheels off the ground. Needless to say, this can lead to a lot of accidents if it’s your first time on a skateboard.Ensuring that your feet stay over the bolts of the trucks is a good way to keep them from drifting toward either end.
The nose and tail will come into play for more advanced tricks, like manuals, ollies and most other “pop” movements, that require you to manipulate the angle of the board.

Know when to foot brake.,
Shift your weight to your front foot.,
Lift up your back foot and drag it along the ground next to the board.,
Apply pressure on the ground until you come to a stop.",How to Stop on a Longboard1," The foot brake should only be used at slow speeds. If you’re flying down a steep hill and about to carve into a turn, the last thing you want to do is hang your foot of your board. Reserve the technique for casual riding at level ground and slower speeds.


Make sure you’re sporting proper footwear when using the foot brake. While using the foot brake is technically possible in thin-soled shoes and flip-flops, it’s not recommended. Using the foot brake involves sliding your shoe along the ground to come to a stop. Don’t use it as an opportunity to ruin shoes and gain friction burns!;
, To begin utilizing the foot brake, shift the majority of your weight (60 to 70 percent) to your front foot. It doesn’t matter whether you have your left or right foot forward. Use whichever foot you normally have out front.


While it is possible to foot brake by leaning onto your back foot, it’s not recommended. Since longboarding involves going down hills, leaning back can unevenly distribute the weight in regards to the angle you’re traveling at. This means your back foot is much more likely to be unstable than your front.

, Begin dragging your back foot along the ground. Do not lean onto your back foot, as that would be stepping off the board (potentially at high speeds). Use a minimal amount of weight to merely drag the foot across the top of the ground.


Make sure the shoes you’re wearing have large enough soles to drag along the ground. You want to avoid any and all sort of foot injuries or wardrobe malfunctions. This technique could easily result in burned or scraped skin or ruined footwear.

, As you drag your foot, slowly apply pressure toward the ground and begin shifting your weight slowly from the front to the back. Remember, the more pressure you apply, the faster you’ll come to a stop. Use your own judgment, taking into account factors like speed, distance and the angle at which you’re traveling.


Be mindful of the type of ground you’re skating on. Friction changes depending on the type of ground you’re traveling on, be it asphalt or concrete. For example, asphalt has a higher skid resistance than concrete, but concrete roads are more durable."

Look for balls with ionomer covers.,
Select balls with an 80 compression rating.,
Choose a multilayer ball.",How to Choose the Right Golf Ball1," Ionomer covers are plastic covers. When you hit them with a golf club, they tend to absorb the energy from the golf club and not spin. This can prevent your ball from spinning and thus gives it more control through the air., You want your golf balls to have more spin when you’re near greens. Spin on a ball is great for controlling short golf shots, and can often lead the ball to stick to the green instead of rolling away.These are also best for golfers who often drive their ball less than 240 yards.

, A multilayer ball also restricts the spin of the ball. These are best for drives that need to go exactly in the direction you want."

Set up the slide.,
Shift your weight to your heels and the front of the board.,
Turn your hips and shoulders in the direction you’re sliding.,
Kick out with your back foot.,
Lean forward as you complete your slide.",How to Stop on a Longboard2," You’re going to begin a powerslide by turning or “carving” out to one side of the road. The turn is an integral part of the powerslide, as it involves drastically turning the board until it’s perpendicular to the road, causing you to skid or “slide” to a stop. The side you carve out to depends completely on how you situate yourself on your longboard. Carve out to the side your toes are pointing (""toeside"") to complete one of the most basic standing powerslides.


Be mindful of traffic coming from both behind and ahead of you. You will not want to attempt to slide and stop with cars coming in either direction, as the powerslide is a tricky maneuver to perform until fully mastered.

, After carving out and setting up your powerslide, shift your weight to your heels. This will mean you’re leaning more backward than forward, allowing your bodyweight to dictate the board’s slide. In addition, put the majority of your weight (60 to 70 percent) on your front foot. This will help when fully turning and fully sliding.


The more weight on your back foot, the harder it will be to slide. While it’s a perfectly normal tendency to have some weight on the back of your board for stability, it’ll actually prevent you from completing a slide in the proper fashion., After you’ve shifted your weight appropriately, swivel your hips and shoulders in the direction of the slide. If you’ve leaned back on your heels and toward the front of your board, use your front foot as a pivot. This will begin your perpendicular slide.


Exercise caution in regards to anything that may be on the ground before performing this step. The tiniest piece of gravel, stone, wood, or glass can easily sabotage your slide and make for some gnarly road rash.
Determine the speed in which you want to turn based on your speed. If you turn too fast, you’re just gong to turn 180 degrees without detracting any sort of speed. Ease into the turn slowly to attain a fuller stop.

, As you pivot with your front foot, kick out in the direction of your slide with your back foot. This will turn you 180 degrees and complete the slide. If performed correctly, you will have slid your board “sideways” along the road or path. Be prepared to skid and slide a short distance.


It’s important to remember to continue leaning back throughout the slide. If you lean forward, you run the risk of bringing your board to a complete stop. At higher speeds, this can be very problematic and runs you the risk of injury.
Continue rotating throughout the entire slide. If you slide completely sideways (perpendicular to the road) for too long, you’ll warp the shape of your wheels to the point of having flat spots. Continuing your rotation will help your wheels evenly wear when powersliding.

, After you’ve turned 180 degrees and continue moving, lean forward and even out your weight. This will prevent you from falling backward after the slide and allow for a smooth transition and a significantly shorter speed. If performed correctly, the powerslide will slow you down to the point you can utilize a foot brake.

Perform a toeside pendulum slide.,
Perform a heelside pendulum slide.,
Perform a 360 slide.",How to Stop on a Longboard3," A ""pendulum"" slide involves sliding a gloved hand along the ground as you perform a powerslide. This involves becoming lower to the ground. Carve out to the side, crouch down, and put all your weight on the front foot. Put a gloved hand on the side you’re sliding away from and perform a powerslide. Use your back foot to kick out and slide and reduce speed. Bring your foot back to continue rolling on your board while also retracting your gloved hand.


Do not put your gloved hand either too far away from your body or too close to your body, as you’ll run the risk of not being able to perform the pendulum or completely falling off your board by being bucked forward.
Performing this maneuver will require a lot of practice and messing up, so don’t worry if you don’t immediately catch on. Keep at it until you perform the maneuver with ease, adding your own style and flare in the process.
Try not to become overly reliant on your hand. Your hand his there to help maintain balance and ensure you can maneuver your legs properly to get the best slide you can.

, Begin by setting your feet up square on the board. Carve out to one side of the road. With a gloved hand, crouch down and begin running your hand along the ground. Kick your feet out in a powerslide maneuver while leaning back on your heels. Weight should be evenly distributed from the front to back. Slide 180 degrees and continue on your way. If performed correctly, you’ll lose a lot of speed but continue forward.


Your free hand can grab your board to help maintain balance. Do not, however, grab the board in between your legs. Grab the board near your back foot instead to avoid interference with the maneuver.

, You can slow your speed drastically by performing two slides at once. This involves performing two successive powerslides. To begin, carve out to one side of the road. Lean back while also placing your weight on your front foot as a pivot before turning your hips and shoulders. Kick out your back foot to perform a power slide before transferring your weight back by leaning forward. Perform the same maneuver again by switching your weight back to the front and rotating your hips the same way as before.


It’s not necessary to use your hands in this maneuver along the ground, as you’ll be typically using them for balance in the air.

Choose golf balls with a urethane cover.,
Use balls with a 100 compression rating.,
Choose a three piece ball.",How to Choose the Right Golf Ball2," Urethane covers have quite a bit of rubber in them. Using a golf ball with a urethane cover allows it to bounce harder off of the golf club, giving it more distance. However, these types of balls are also harder to control, so they are generally better for more advanced golfers., The center of this ball is harder. Again, they’ll go further but are harder to control. These are best for golfers who regularly drive further than 240 yards (220 m)., The layers of the ball allow for a particular transference of energy that makes the ball go further. They also tend to roll longer, so you’ll get distance over the ground, rather than just in the air."

Choose cheap balls if you’re new.,
Pick mid-range priced balls if you’re an average golfer.,
Select expensive balls if you’re a regular player.",How to Choose the Right Golf Ball3," If you’re new to the game of golf, you’ll likely be losing a lot of them. Buying expensive or even mid-range balls that you might lose is a good way to waste your money. Instead, look for balls that are around $10 to $20 per dozen.Try to avoid purchasing recycled balls, which usually come from driving ranges. They’re cheap, but they’re usually of a poor quality and they can actually impede your game.

, These golf balls are usually $25 to $35 per dozen. They generally give you a good mix of control and distance, which is great if you’re an average golfer., If you’re a regular player – you play a few times a week – look for more expensive balls. These are usually over $35 per dozen, but can help you make the small tweaks that take your game to the next level. These type of balls tend to be very specific in what they do, so know which elements of your game you want to improve before you buy this type."

Buy a single sleeve of each kind.,
Take them to the range or putting green.,
Focus on one type at a time.,
Take notes.,
Keep an assortment on hand while you golf.",How to Choose the Right Golf Ball4," If there’s a few types of balls that you’re interested in, but you’re not sure which will be best, just get one sleeve (three balls) of each kind. That way you have enough to practice with but you don’t end up with a bunch of balls you won’t use.

, Once you’ve purchased the balls you think might work, head to the driving range or putting green to practice. This gives you a chance to feel them out before you play an actual game.Keep in mind that if you take your new balls to a driving range, you won’t get them back.

, For example, only hit the ones you’re interested in for control first, and then move to those you got for distance. You don’t want to confuse the different types and then end up buying the wrong kind!

, It’s going to be hard to keep track of the things you like or don’t like about each kind of ball. Take a small notepad with you so you can note the differences between the types. This will act as a great reference when you’re ready to buy a larger amount., The clubs you're using and the conditions on the course will affect the type of ball you should use. Having an assortment of golf balls with you, that address different areas of concern, can help you have a great game no matter what.

Spend at least 20 minutes in the boots.,
Try a size up and a size down.,
Consider custom insoles.",How to Fit Ski Boots," There will naturally be a size difference between your bare foot and your foot in a wool sock. So be sure at every stage of the fitting process to wear your ski socks.


It’s best to wear thin wool socks when skiing. These will keep your feet warm, but still allow you to feel the sole of your boot as you ski.;
, Asking someone to help you with this will yield a more accurate outline, but you can also do it by yourself. While standing on a blank piece of paper, trace the edge of your foot all the way around with a pencil or pen.

, Ski boots use a sizing system referred to as “mondo,” which translates to “world.” This universal system, based on centimeters, eliminates the need to convert sizes between U.S., E.U., etc.If you don't have anything that measures in centimeters, you can measure in inches and then convert. Multiply the number in inches by 2.54. The result will give you the correct number in centimeters., Start from the back of the heel and measure to the tip of the longest toe. The number you get in centimeters is your mondo size. For example, if it’s 26 centimeters long, you are a size 26.


Take note of any fractions. Some manufacturers make ski boots in half sizes, so don’t round up. If you’re a 26.5, you may be able to find that exact size.

, Many manufacturers offer narrow or wide sizes, so it’s useful to know if your foot falls into one of those categories.Measure the widest part of your foot (usually the ball of your foot just below your toes) and write down that number.


Designations like “wide” and “narrow” are relative to the length of your foot. Look online for a sizing chart that compares your foot length to its width and then classifies it as narrow, medium, or wide.

, Stomp down with your heel two or three times into the ground. This helps adjust your foot to the proper placement inside the boot. Avoid doing this on any flooring you don't want damaged, since the boot could ding or scratch wooden floors., Most models will have these at the front and sides, though some children’s models have them at the back. Buckle them to whatever tightness feels snug but not uncomfortable. Don’t tuck your pants into the tops of the boots since this will change the fit through your calf.

, While standing straight up, your toes should just brush the front of the boot.If you wiggle your toes and can’t feel anything brushing against them, the boots are likely too big. If your toes have to bend up or down to fit your entire foot in the boot, then they’re too small.

, Since liners break down over time, you want to be sure that the hard shell of the boot is a good fit. Take the liner out of the boot and stand with your toes pushed forward until they touch the front of the boot. You should be able to fit 1-2 fingers in between your heel and the back of the shell., Bend your legs at the knees as you would if you were skiing downhill. Feel the placement of your toes and heels. In this position your heels should not lift off the sole and your toes should just barely pull back from brushing the front of the boot., Walk around in them and get a feel for any areas where the boot is too tight or is rubbing your foot uncomfortably. The longer you spend in them now, the better sense you will get for how they’ll feel on your feet for hours on the slopes., If you’re trying on boots in a store, it may be helpful to test out other sizes, just to be sure you like the fit of the boot you’ve chosen. If you ordered online, read the site’s return policy to see if you can get free return shipping, then order two or three different sizes to test them out at home.

, If you are buying ski boots, as opposed to renting, you may want to look into insoles that are specifically designed to fit your feet. Ski shops and sport shops can help you fit thermal-formable insoles, which will help fix a variety of issues like toe jamming, aching arches, and ankle pain."

Choose a layer with a texture that looks most like a waffle., Choose a thin, wicking, thermal shirt fitted to your chest. Opt for synthetic materials like polypropylene. Natural material like cotton or wool don't have the wicking power you'll need on the slopes. Make sure the top doesn't slide around while you walk., Make sure these are thin and fitting against your legs. This next-to-body fit will keep you warm. Choose a synthetic fabric to wick away moisture., This fabric is available in different weights and is great for wicking and insulation. Cotton won't wick moisture or insulate as well. Choose fabric that's a cross between form-fitting and bulky. This way, you'll get the insulation and wicking power you need without struggling to get your outer layer on over the middle layer., Wear a sweater or jacket with a half- or full-zip with standup collar. This will keep you warmer. Look for underarm zippers known as “pit vents” to allow sweat to escape properly., Soft shells are form-fitting yet stretchier for comfort. They come in wind-resistant and windproof varieties. Look for soft shells with a waterproof DWR coating on the outside., This layer might be optional with current fabric technology for base and outer layers. Ask the shop staff for help if you're new to skiing. If you do need mid-layer pants, go for something relatively tight to allow the outer layer to slide on with no problem., Opt for something roomy enough to comfortably accommodate your layers but not too loose or bulky. Make sure it's a waterproof and properly insulated ski jacket - not a hoodie or a sweatshirt. Ski jackets use special fabrics, insulation and features to keep you warm. These include waterproof-breathable fabrics, heat-retaining insulation, and a powder skirt or closeable cuffs and hem., Go for actual ski pants made for the slopes. They have an inner powder cuff that you slide over your boots to prevent snow from getting in. Your pants should fit well and allow you to move comfortably., Wear only one pair of socks to keep your feet from sweating too much. Your socks should be thin but warm. If you're renting boots, choose slightly thicker socks for comfort. Make sure they have padding to protect your shins when they press against your ski boots., Any other boots won't clip to your skis. Buy or rent boots that fit the width of your feet. Look for boots with good flexibility. If you're skiing recreationally, avoid stiff boots designed for racing., No matter what the conditions are on the slopes, this is a must. You can get a sunburn even if it's cold and overcast. Opt for SPF 15-30, depending on how fair your skin is.Don't forget about your lips! Slather on lip balm with an SPF of at least 15., Make sure that they're designed for skiing. Regular gloves won't give you the protection you need. Ski gloves are thicker and have a rubber lining on the outside for easy grip. If you plan on skiing in a very cold climate and/or harsh terrain, buy gloves with wrist protection and a built-in inner glove., Spend the extra money on high-quality goggles. They'll protect you from snow blindness and help you to navigate cloudy conditions with few shadows. They'll also protect you from flying debris that can get caught in your eyes.When you come back from the slopes, allow your goggles to dry outside their protective case to prevent mold buildup., A gaiter is a felt tube that you slip on your neck. Pull it over your mouth on especially cold days. Always keep the bottom of the gaiter under the collar of your ski jacket., A hat will keep your head warm, but a helmet will protect you from head injuries. Make this a rule for any condition you could be skiing in.

,
Signal for help if you're not able to move once out.,
Always ski well clear of trees when skiing deep powder.",How to Escape a Tree Well when Skiing," Generally, a skier will tip head first into the hole created by the tree well. This means that your head and arms will be heading straight down into the hole and your skis will be the last thing above you. Loose snow will start to fall in around you as you tumble, packing you in against the tree or other snow in the hole.


The biggest threat is suffocation from the snow packing in around you. Another threat can be from hitting the tree and getting concussion or other injuries.;
, Rapid movement and struggling will worsen your situation. It is important to stop panicking and to start thinking as calmly as you can about how to get out.


Bear in mind that every bit of wriggling, squirming, struggling, and angry gestures will compact more snow around you. Save your energy and let your thinking take over.

, As you fall, do your very best to arrest yourself as quickly as possible. Do this by grabbing and holding onto the tree branches, or any other parts of the tree to try to stabilize yourself and stop yourself from falling any deeper. Hold on tight.

, Breathe. Be aware that every movement, however slight, will cause more snow to pack in.

, At this point, consider whether you have the energy or even the opportunity to try to wedge yourself out of the situation. If you don't, continue focusing on creating air holes and waiting for rescue. Use a rocking method to carve out space in the snow and to gain more air; your body heat may also help to compact snow around you that can help you to lift yourself up from. If you think you might be able to get yourself out, consider the following method, based on how Craig McNeil got himself out of a tree well:


Turn your body as slowly as you can to try to turn yourself upright.
Pull yourself up the tree, slowly. This will be a long and difficult process. While there is no guarantee of success, continue believing that you can do this and be aware that people have escaped from this situation.

,, You are likely to be very tired, so conserve your energy as best you can and use snow cover to keep you warm.

, Falling into a tree well is completely preventable, simply by staying away from trees in deep snow.

The course rating tells you what the total par is from the corresponding set of tees. The slope rating is based around an average of 113. If the slope rating is lower than 113, you are playing an easier course, if it is more than 113, you are playing a more difficult course. The course difficulty is determined by the amount and type of obstacles each hole contains.

Always have a hot hearty breakfast at your accommodation, to fuel you up for the day.,
Carpool or use the internet to find if your mountain has any bus service to it.,
If you do not have ski/snowboard gear, seek out a local rental place and rent your gear ahead of time, it is much cheaper than renting at the resort.,
Arrive early!,
Stop at some sort of quick breakfast food establishment on the way up.,
Try to find people who ski/board similarly to your level.,
Try cross country skiing.",How to Have an Inexpensive Ski Day," It will cost $20 on a ski-area burger, fries and drink, let alone any snacks during the day. Buy groceries to make lunches for the next day or next few days and ideally for a few people so as to share the cost. Shop below the mountain or resort as that will be much cheaper. Buy bulk bags or boxes of snack bars and chocolate bars as snacks. It's surprising how hungry you'll get on the mountain.;
, You'll save heaps of money preparing your meals rather than buying meals three times a day. Cooking your own meals is cheaper than take out from Maccas, not to mention, healthier.

, Hot oats with dried fruit and honey is an ideal quick breakfast. Breakfast burritos are highly recommended as breakfast food, they are inexpensive and heavy in protein. If you want to save money on-slope, eat lots at breakfast.

,  Try to find a group where several people have cars and rotate driving responsibilities.  This makes paying for gas less of a hassle.

,  Other cheap rental options often lie in towns near resorts or on the road up to resorts.

, The earlier you arrive the more value you get out of an all-day ticket.  Many mountains have highways and interstates leading up to them that tend to get very slow with high-volume ski traffic.

,  This is very inexpensive compared to resort food and will fuel you well through the morning. This also provides a nice stop for the driver and passengers and allows everyone to stretch their legs and wake-up for the day.

,  By going with people who are similar in ability to you, you will progress on runs at the same speed and not end up waiting for slow group members very often.

, Trail fees are much cheaper than downhill lift passes and the hire cost of cross country skis and poles is a fraction of the cost.

Identify how far away you are from the basket.,
Identify the direction and velocity of the wind.,
Choose your disc.,Place your index finger so the knuckle closest to your finger tip is resting on the bottom of the rim of the disc.,Keep your thumb pressed on the top of the disc.,
Place the rest of your fingers where you feel they are most comfortable.,Face the basket.,
Place your dominant foot ahead of the other, so it is closer to the basket.,Point your forward foot towards the basket, but slightly turned toward your opposite foot.,
Place your back foot so that you could draw a line from the basket, through the ball of your front foot to your back heel.,Make sure your knees are bent and you are balanced.,
Bring the disc out in front of you with your arm out, about chest level.,With your arm extended, bring the disc down to your front thigh.,
Shift your weight backwards.,
While raising your extended arm to the release point, push off of your back foot and move your weight back onto your front foot.,
Release the disc when your weight is fully forward.,
If you made the putt, good job!,
If you missed, try to identify what went wrong.,
Continue practicing.",How to Push Putt in Disc Golf," Take note of whether you are inside the ""putting circle"" or not. The putting circle is within 10 meters of the basket.
, The wind will affect your disc while it is in the air. In general, the following are true: A tailwind will push your putt down.
A headwind will will make your putt rise.
A crosswind will push the disc in the direction of the wind.

, If you have multiple putters, you should take the previous two steps into account when choosing which one to throw. For the majority of your putts, you should use a stiff putter that you are comfortable throwing.,,, You will be pushing the disc with your palm when you throw, so you just want to make sure the back of your grip is firm.,, Your dominant foot is the foot on the same side as the arm you throw with. Your feet should be about shoulder length apart.,, Your back foot should be on similar angle to your front foot.,, This is where you will be releasing the disc. The orientation of the disc as it leaves your hand will determine how it will fly. For a push putt, you want to release the disc slightly nose up, to make sure you get the disc to the basket. Your wrist should be slightly bent to be in line with your feet.,, All of your weight should be on your back leg while your front leg is straight with the knee locked and your toe off the ground., As your arm raises, your back leg should lift off the ground., The momentum needed to get the disc to the basket is going to be created from timing the movements correctly. You want to aggregate the energy from you lower and upper body into the exact moment you release the disc. You will get a minimal amount of energy from your wrist as it moves back to a straight position on release., Quickly collect your disc from the basket so the next person can throw., Don't dwell on it, but make a point of it, so you can throw better on the next try., It may feel like an unnatural technique, but the push putt style will enable you to be a consistent putter."

Know your clubs.,
Learn the stance.,
Wind up.,
Bring your club high.,
Shift into your swing.,
Start at the tee box.,
Continue in order.,
Move to the next hole.",How to Play Golf," The object of golf is to strike the golf ball with a long-handled instrument called a club and guide it into each hole on the course in order, whilst trying to minimise the number of shots. A number of holes, usually 9 or 18, are played and the final results are tallied after the last player has sunk the ball in the final hole.;
, In golf, a lower score is better. Golfers get 1 point for every time they hit the ball with a club, which means that the player who can get the ball into every hole with the fewest overall swings (golf club hits) will win. There are a number of terms related to golf scoring:


Par: This is the preset number attached to each hole that represents the number of shots (and therefore, the number of points) that a perfect golfer should normally require to sink the ball. A golfer who meets this number is said to be “on par” for the hole.
Bogeys: A bogey is a score that is one point (one swing) above par. If a golfer takes more than one extra swing to complete a hole, it is said to be a “double bogey,” “triple bogey,” and so on depending on the total number of swings.
Birdie: A birdie is a score that is one point below par.
Eagle: A score that is two points below par on a par 4 or higher course is called an eagle.
Hole in one: A hole in one occurs when the golfer manages to sink the ball with a single swing from the tee box (that is, the starting position).

, The other parts of the course are outlined below:


Fairway: The fairway is the trimmed part of the golf course between the tee box and the green.
Rough: The rough is the wild or less-groomed area that borders on the fairway.
Putting green: The putting green, or green, is where the hole for each fairway is located.
Hazards: Also called traps, hazards are purposely-placed elements that are designed to be especially difficult to get a golf ball out of. Common hazards include sand traps and bodies of water.

, Different golf clubs have different physical properties and are used for different types of golf swing. Being able to guess which club to use in a given situation is a skill that expert golfers develop over time, but the basic distinctions are fairly simple:


A wood has a wide head and is usually made of a fairly light material, such as wood or lightweight metal. Woods are used for long “drives” of the ball across great distances, and as such are sometimes also called “drivers.”
An iron is much narrower than a wood, and typically made of heavier metal. Irons are most often used for medium-and short-range shots.
A putter is a special club for use on the putting green, where precise control over the direction and speed the ball will roll can make the difference between a birdie and a bogey. Putters are small, and usually made of lightweight metal.

, Knowing how to swing a club is all-important to enjoying the game of golf, and a good swing starts with a good stance. The standard swing stance is a balanced and flexible starting point for your swing. Stand to the side of the golf ball (compared to the direction you want to hit it towards), facing it, with your feet set shoulder-width apart. Bend slightly at the knees and push your hips back while leaning your spine slightly forward toward the golf ball. There are other methods and techniques, but this basic stance is effective and widely used with very little variation even by professional golfers. Hold the golf club by the grip with both hands.

, Bring the club up and around yourself to set up a good, strong swing. Try to lead with the head of your golf club first, and let your hands, arms, and shoulders follow it in that order. Finally, to finish the windup, twist at the hip. This will allow you to get the maximum amount of power out of your swing without losing your balanced stance.

, Continue to follow through with the “wind up” motion described above. Let your wrists bend as your weight shifts to your swing side (typically the right ride for a right-handed golfer) so that you end up coiled with the head of the club pointing out towards the fairway, above and behind your head.

, Lean into your leading leg to slightly shift your weight forward onto it as you swing the club around and towards the golf ball. Allow your back leg to bend as the weight shifts off of it, and follow through by pivoting on the toe of that foot as you complete your swing. With a little practice, the golf ball should be sailing through the air on a neat, controlled trajectory.

, A group of players meet at the first hole of their chosen course and take turns hitting their balls out of the tee box and (hopefully) onto the fairway or the green. A tee, which is a small wooden or plastic golf ball stand, may be used at the tee box, or the ball can be set on the grass, as each player prefers.

, In the same order as the starting order, each player takes turns hitting his or her ball until all players have managed to sink the ball in the hole. Because of the potential danger of being hit by a flying golf ball, other members of the group should stand well away from, and never down the fairway from, the person who is swinging.


Even if a ball lands in the rough or a sand trap, its owner must hit it from that spot without moving it or altering the terrain. A ball that lands in a water hazard can be replaced with another ball as long as it is placed within two club lengths of the hazard, but it will cost the player an extra point for that hole.
When two or more golf balls are on the putting green, it is acceptable to move any balls that might interfere with another player's put, as long as the position is clearly marked and the ball is returned to that spot afterward.

, Once all players in a group have tallied their final scores for a hole, the group may move on to the next hole. Golf courses are designed so that each hole can be visited in order without having to backtrack or cross in front of other people's games, but care should be taken to give other groups space if they are moving more slowly than your group. A typical round of golf can last anywhere from three to six hours.

Go to a golf course or practice facility that has a practice green.,
Place your ball one foot from the hole and at the low side of the hole, so that your first putt is uphill.,
If you have a pre-putt routine (recommended), use it on each and every shot.,
After putting out, go back to the original position one foot below the hole.,
This is your second position, which is at one o'clock and two feet from the hole.,
Your last position is from the six o'clock position and eighteen feet from the hole.,
Keep track of how many putts you make.",How to Practice Putting," On your first few trips, try to find a hole location that is relatively flat. As your skills increase, you can look for more challenging hole positions. Since you will be hogging a hole, you might need to vary the times you go until you find a time that is not crowded.;
, Putt the ball into the hole from this spot. Aim for the back of the cup. Be aggressive, with no fear of missing. This is not one of those miss and start all over drills.

, This is a good opportunity to refine and define your pre-putt routine. Take time to read the green. If you miss a putt, finish putting from wherever your ball comes to rest. In other words, putt out every ball as if you were playing a regular round of golf. Keep putting until your ball is in the cup.

, Stand at that position and face the hole. Imagine you are looking at a clock and the hole is the center of the clock that the minute and hour arms pivot. This is your 12:00 starting position. From here, move to the one o'clock position, the position directly to your left. Next take a one foot step back so that you are standing two feet from the hole.

, From here, putt your ball into the hole. Again, read the green, perform your pre-putt routine and be aggressive with your putt. Continue moving through the clock and moving one foot further from the hole until you have circled the clock 1-1/2 times. Your third position should be at two o'clock and three feet from the hole. Your fourth position will be at three o'clock and four feet from the hole.

, At completion, you will have putted from eighteen different positions. Each position becoming progressively more difficult. You have just simulated an eighteen hole round of putts.

, The goal is to take 36 or less strokes per practice drill. Remember, putt out every ball, even from two inches. Count every stroke. Be honest with yourself. Keep this up and you will see improvement in your putting. This will translate into lower scores. Which translates into higher confidence. Which again translates into even lower scores.

Begin with basic slopestyle tricks.,
Perform a basic box grind.,
Perform a basic 360.",How to Freestyle Ski1," Slope style skiing refers to a run with multiple jumps, boxes, and rails set up, on which skiers can perform aerial tricks and grinds. Becoming comfortable with the positioning, balance, maneuvers, and landing of basic slopestyle tricks will give you a strong freestyle skiing foundation on which to build.;
, Slopestyle runs will commonly have boxes and rails for skiers to perform grind tricks. Begin practicing this style of trick on a box rather than a rail because boxes offer a wider ledge, making it easier to balance. Additionally, find a low box that requires a less difficult jump to reach.


Approach the box straight on and in line with the length of it.Approaching in a straight line uses your established momentum to carry you down the length of the box, which is much easier for beginners.
Pop up just before reaching the box and turn ninety degrees to land. You should land with your feet centered on the box to maximize balance. Keep your shoulders square with your feet as well, meaning turn only your head to track your movement.Keep your feet a shoulder-width apart and firmly planted with even weight distribution as you grind down the box. By keeping your feet apart, you spread out your center of gravity on the box. By evenly distributing your weight, you stop your skis from catching and causing you to fall.Straighten out as you come off the box. Since your skis will still be perpendicular to your movement, you must straighten out as you dismount the box. By lifting the front of your forward most ski, you can use your boot on the lip of the box to help push off., One of the most common tricks off a slopestyle jump is a 360, where you turn your body in one full rotation before landing. This basic trick has numerous variations once you get the hang of it.


Start practicing by jumping a 360 on the ground and sliding a 360 in the snow. Sliding a 360 in the snow means adding spin to your forward movement without your skis leaving the ground. Both exercises are easier than a jumping 360 and help you train yourself in the amount of rotation a perfect 360 will require. The main skills to practice include twisting with your shoulders and arms, as well as leading the direction of your spin with your head.Ridges in the snow make great spots to practice 360s before trying larger jumps. A ridge offers very little drop off, making a potential fall less dangerous.
When trying an actual 360, approach the ridge or jump with your feet shoulder-width apart, crouch down with your weight over your toes, and twist with your head, shoulders, and arms as you pop off the lip. Keep your head up and look over your shoulder until your can see in the direction of your forward movement down the hill. Your feet will naturally straighten out in the direction of your head to help you land facing forward"

, Google Earth shots might also be helpful.

, Print out a scorecard from online. If possible, play a game there. Ask friends who have played the course or ask people who work at the course about major hazards, tricks, yard markers, and green speed.

, If you are a member at any particular course that has a driving range and a putting green, then that is perfect. If not, then go to a local driving range.

, When you reach the range make sure you grab 2 clubs and start loosening up your muscles take about 5-6 swings. You also need to stretch your major ""golfing"" muscles.


Generally at a junior tournament, if the host club has a range, the club will give you around 30-50 balls (depending on size) for your warm-up routine.

, You do not need to be playing target golf for your first two shots.

, Since you don't have many golf balls, use the irons that you play your best with. This will boost your confidence when on the range.

, When you have two golf balls left, figure out what you are going to hit on the first tee and go through your routine.

, While on your local club's range, make every shot count.

, Make sure you are well rested. Instead, go out on the range for an hour every day the week before a tournament, not cramming in 5 hours of practice the day before.

, A big thing in golf is mental toughness. It is not all about having the nicest and best equipment. And do not believe all the scores people say they shoot; until the end of the round, most are there to intimidate you.

, Enjoying yourself is the most important.

Start on a space with fewer, smaller moguls and wider troughs.,
Practice going across the bumps.,
Practice turning on the bump instead of between them in the troughs.,
Use the backs of oncoming bumps to slow yourself down.,
Plan your first two or three turns down the run.",How to Freestyle Ski2," Mogul skiing consists of a course of bumps, called moguls, in the snow with networks of gaps between the bumps, called troughs. In competitive events, the run is timed, but noncompetitive mogul skiers may simply have fun taking untimed, creative routes down a course. By starting with smaller moguls and wider troughs, you will have an easier time navigating the run and absorbing the bumps as you practice the other basics of skiing moguls.

, By going across the bumps, you can practice important techniques for skiing moguls, such as keeping your balance with your head over your feet and absorbing the the bumps by keeping your head at the same height and instead correcting for the height difference in your knees., By going across a bump and turning yourself in the direction of the next trough (the lower parts of the mogul between the bumps), you can use the angle of the bump to turn more swiftly.The ideal path down a mogul run will consist of a combination of going around the bumps (down the troughs) and going across a bump to angle yourself into a better oncoming trough. Practice both skills on their own, and then try linking them together.

, With larger bumps and narrower gaps, you will have to cut harder to maintain your route through the troughs, which is more difficult on steeper hills where you gain more speed. By using the initial incline of an oncoming bump, you can appropriately slow yourself while positioning into the best angle of the oncoming trough.For best results, begin to turn in the direction of the trough, creating a wider plane with your skis to inch up to the back of the bump in front of you. Combined with the incline, this will help you control your speed even more.
Plant your pole into the bump just before you feel the major slowdown. By doing so, you help maintain balance as you brake, and you additionally give yourself leverage to push off the pole, which will help you more easily angle into the trough., Don’t just set off down the course ahead. Instead, survey the run and plan your first several turns. This will set your rhythm for the course and help you keep control farther down the run.


Your initial planning should also take your corridor into account. A wider corridor—one which crosses from left to right across four or five moguls—spreads your descent across a greater distance and means less acceleration. A narrower corridor—only two or three moguls across—will mean a faster descent and greater speed.As you decide how to take a bump or trough, begin to execute the necessary maneuver and keep your gaze ahead. This way you can stay mentally ahead of yourself and make a better decision for the next oncoming bump.

Get comfortable with skiing at high speed.,
Practice taking the best line over jumps.,
Practice taking high-banked turns.,
Practice skiing with others.",How to Freestyle Ski3," Ski cross (think motocross) is a timed skiing event with several competitors racing down a run at the same time. It is still considered a freestyle skiing event because of its liberal use of large jumps and high-banked turns. Since ski cross is a race at its core, practice skiing at high speed.


Do not ever overextend yourself and exceed your own comfort levels. Begin by timing yourself on a comfortable run at your normal pace and try to start improving your time over several runs down the course. Skiing at speed is about comfort and confidence, and you will not develop either without plenty of practice.

, While many freestyle skiing varieties use jumps to perform tricks, ski cross is about flying through the jump efficiently and maintaining speed. This means staying low in the air and propelling yourself forward rather than up.


Do not pop or jump off a ski cross jump like you would in slopestyle. Instead, crouch down and absorb the jump with your knees. By keeping your head low and knees bent, you maintain the maximum forward velocity off the lip of the jump as well as the least wind resistance through the air. Straighten out past the apex of the jump, so that you can land with the maximum balance.

, Ski cross courses regularly change direction with high-banked turns. As with turning anything at a high rate of speed, the angle at which you enter the turn has the biggest effect on the outcome. By starting with a slightly outside line and diving down into the turn, you create a wider turning radius, thus leading to less deceleration.


Half-pipes make great places to practice several high-banked turns. Instead of using your momentum to carry yourself off the lip of the half-pipe, simply drift up the side of the bank and use the wall to carve down and across the other side of the half-pipe.

, Since ski cross events always involve a field of skiers, you need to become comfortable skiing in a pack. The basic rules of skiing right of way do not change, but following them in closer quarters takes practice and mindfulness.


Do not practice this by encroaching upon the space of other skiers on normal runs. Look into ski cross clubs and events where you will find others interested in ski cross with whom you can practice these techniques.

Your future green should receive plenty of airflow, without any blockage of wind from buildings, bushes, or trees. Low spots in your backyard or areas that drain poorly should also be avoided, but after you've found the ideal place for your green, you should:Imagine the overall dimensions for your green. After you have a feel for the features of your soon-to-be putting green, take a piece of paper and sketch out the general design, including desired measurements. Then, measure and stake out your planned putting green area.
Keep in mind, the larger your green, the more effort it will take to maintain and the greater the cost of its installation.;
, For the turf of your green to flourish, its roots will need the right kind of soil. Most soils are suitable for the roots of your grass, though the ideal soil composition will be sandy loam soil. If your soil has a high concentration of clay, your turf will suffer greatly, and may not be able to grow well enough for you to putt., A percolation test can give you a good idea of the whether your soil composition is good enough for the roots of your grass and is relatively easy to perform. You will need to dig a hole 2' deep with the width of about a foot. Now, fill your hole with water and allow it to drain over the course of a day. Then, note the time, and fill the hole with water again.


Holes that drain in less than 12 hours have a rate of percolation that will support plants the require well-drained soil, which includes your putting green grass.
Holes that drain in 12 - 24 hours are suited for plants that live in heavy or clay soil.
Holes that drain in over 24 hours are unsuitable for most plants., The contours of your green-to-be should allow water to drain quickly and easily, otherwise your green could fail. Low areas where water can collect will also bad for your green. Try to provide multiple drainage routes to keep the grass from becoming waterlogged.You can improve drainage conditions by installing drainage tiles below the surface of your green. It is advised that you place these close together, at a maximum spacing distance of no more than 10 feet (3 m)., There are two dominant types of grass used to build putting greens, Creeping Bentgrass and Bermuda. Depending on region, you may want to use one over the other, or you in certain areas, a hybrid might flourish. To check the distribution of Creeping Bentgrass and Bermuda according to state, visit:http://www.putting-greens.com/types.html

, You'll need to tear up any original sod where you plan to make your green. After sod removal, you should rake rocks and other debris to create optimal drainage, aeration, and seeding conditions.Using a tiller for the soil will loosen and aerate the soil even more, promoting even better growth and soil consistency.
Keep in mind that spring is the best time to plant a putting green.

, The best way to ensure that your putting area stays sufficiently drained is to install drainage tiles or vented plastic pipe. Dig a trenches that are roughly 24 inches (61 cm) deep and 12 inches wide, that lead from the edges of your green and through it, with the trench sloping downward away from your green leading water away from it. To install drainage, you should:


Place filter fabric around the bottom of your trench so it reaches up the sides.
Lay your perforated/vented plastic pipe in the trench.
Fill your trench with 12 inches (30.5 cm) of coarse, clean gravel.
Fold the ends of your filter fabric on top of your gravel.
Refill the remainder of your trench with soil., An extra degree of separation can not only keep your putting green more weed free, it can also keep your yard from getting invaded with Bentgrass or Bermuda. Using a plastic lining is a good way to protect your green from your yard and your yard from your green.

, For your first attempt at making your own putting green, the easiest kind to make are mostly level. Low spots can ruin the quality of your grass, so you should spread soil evenly with your rake.Keep about a yard of sand off to the side to fill in low spots, animal tracks, or any other unplanned changes to your green., Using your bulb planter, create a hole slightly larger than a golf ball where you think would be best for you putting hole. This is just to give you an idea of the layout of your green; you will sculpt the hole and insert the putting cup later.

, Mix some of your seed with your sand to offer it additional cover when you scatter it. This can be helpful if you have a bird problem, though if you notice birds feeding heavily on your seed, you may want to scatter extra. In principle, a pound of seed should cover about 2,000 square feet, though there will be some variance depending on the kind of grass on which you decide., Depending on the kind of grass you have chosen to use for your green, there will be many different options of fertilizer you can use. You should research the fertilizer best suited for your seed by searching online.Different types of grass will also have ideal times at which you should apply fertilizer. Research this information as well to see best results in your grass growth.

, Newly sown grass is very thirsty, so you'll need to water your putting green heavily, twice daily. Many putting green designers also recommend syringing your green, especially in hot weather.Syringing is where you lightly water turf to cool off your turf canopy and prevent wilt.
If no complications arise, your turf should germinate in 10 days., The first cut of your putting green grass should be after the grass has exceed two inches in height. You will need to be careful when walking behind your greens mower. Walk with gentle, flat footed steps, as the top layer of your green will still be loose. As a good root system grows, the ground will firm up.


Mow the putting green often. By cutting your grass 3 or 4 times per week, it will maintain a height of around ¼"" - a perfect putting height., For every 1,000 square feet of yard space apply at least ½ pound of nitrogen to the soil between early May and early June. From mid-September to mid-November, use at least 1 pound of nitrogen.You should also look into special fertilizer formulated for your type of grass and/or putting greens. Many companies have special blends of fertilizer. You'll need to research for yourself to find what works best for your situation.

, This will also depend on the kind of grass you have decided and the area in which you live. Certain kinds of grass are more susceptible to certain kinds of mold, and some strains of mold might not live in your region.


Generally, you should administer fungicide once every month., At the first sign of dryness you should water your green to prevent it from sun damage. Apply water to the putting green during the early morning hours, such as between 5 and 7 a.m.

, The small hole you dug for your putting hole may suffice for your needs, but installing a cup will give your green a more realistic feel. You can further sculpt your putting hole by using a jigsaw or a golf-hole cutter, and insert the cup.


Your cup should sit a ½"" below the grass level.

, To complete the aesthetic, you can take the component flag that came with your putting cup and insert it into your cup. This is a good way of checking to see if your cup has been placed in the hole flush with the ground. An unlevel cup might mean your ball bounces out of the hole more frequently than it should.

Drinking Golf should only be set on a nine hole course, 18 holes would mean that the majority of players would end their night in hospital, crying.,
Create a course: Choose 9 bars that are in the general vicinity of each other.

,
Ensure that the busier bars are located near the end of the game.,
Once the course has been chosen, draw up a score sheet that takes account of each player and the score they will get in each pub.

,
On the score sheet indicate which holes are to be water holes.,
Set the par for each hole.,
Set off on the course with friends in tow.

,
In each pub buy a pint of beer, Ale or Stout each.

,
Let person number one on the score sheet take the first tee shot.

,
Shot are scored by how many gulps of beer it takes to finish each pint.

,
A hole in one is when the pint it downed in one.

,Holes in one can also be scored if you pull a kraut

,
Four gulps would be a bogey, five gulps would be a double bogey, two gulps would be a birdie etc etc.

,Each person will take their initial tee-shot in the order they are present on the score sheet

,
After the initial shot, each person may takes a shot (gulp) as they wish.,
When everyone has finished their drink, take note of the scores.

,Exit the pub and make your way to the next hole ( pub/bar)

,
On designated water holes, no one may use the toilet.,
Getting sick or spilling any of your pint earns you 3 and 2 penalty shots respectively.

,
Repeat each process in all nine pubs.

You must first rent the golf cart from the pro shop or club house and obtain a key.,
Locate your golf cart by finding the cart that has the same number as the one on your key.

,
Strap your golf clubs and any other essentials in the back of the golf cart securely.

,
Make sure the brake is locked before putting the key in.,
Put the golf cart in the forward “F” position.,
SLOWLY press down on the gas.,
Drive with caution and watch out for turns, because golf carts are easy to lose control or flip over.

,
To drive the cart in reverse, just switch the gear to “R” and slowly press on the gas.

,
To stop the golf cart you will want to gradually press down on the brake until you hear it lock in place.,
Take the key out when you are not operating the golf cart.

",How to Operate a Golf Cart,";
,,, Put the key in the ignition and turn the key to the right until it is in the on position. The ignition is usually located below and to the right of the steering wheel. Note: You will not hear the golf carts engine come on, most golf carts are quiet.

, The reverse “R” position is to go backwards and this will make a loud beeping noise. Note: Some carts “F”, “R” button will be under the seat or on the dash.

, It is important that you do not slam on the gas, because golf carts start out at their full acceleration and they will jerk you. After slowly pressing on the gas you will hear the break release and then gradually increase the gas.

,,, It is CRITICAL that the brake is locked in place otherwise the golf cart will not remain parked.

Flare your feet and point your toes out a little.,
Bend at the waist.,
Practice this drill to get the feeling of bending at the waist: Stand up straight, with your knees locked.,
Flex your knees.,
Let your arms fall straight down.

",How to Make a Proper Golf Stance," It is extremely important that you set a stable base with your golf stance. Creating a stable base will give you a solid connection to the ground while also giving you a stable platform to rotate against. As you get into short irons and wedges, the stance should get a little less wide for more consistency.;
, The key to golf is consistency and the ground is the only thing that remains constant during your golf swing. In order to have a consistent swing you need to have your feet firmly planted on the ground.

, Aside from your hands and arms, during the golf swing your hips and shoulders should be the only parts of your body moving. A stable base will let you rotate and coil while still maintaining control of the resistance and power your are creating.

, This will make it easier for you to rotate your hips.

, Bend at the waist, not the back. It is very important that you bend from the waist properly. Bending from the waist will set your hips, back and shoulders all in a straight line. With these three sections of the body aligned, you can properly rotate your hips and shoulders along the same plane. If you bend from your back, your hips, back and shoulders will all be pointing in different directions, making it impossible to rotate consistently.

, Now stick out your butt. That is how you should be bending your body.

, Once you have set a solid base and are bending from waist, the only thing that is left to really do is flex your knees. You want to feel as though you are getting into a nice, athletic stance. With your knees slightly bent and flexed, you should feel like you have the ability to spring to the left or right.

Recognise why your short game is suffering.,
For pitching, try Using a pitching wedge or a lower lofted sand wedge.,
Work on your chipping.,
Practice your lob shot...a lot.,
Also, work on your bunker shot.",How to Improve Your Short Game," When playing near or around the green, a decent short game will allow you to get near the pin for a simple one or two-putt. So, if you’re struggling to reach the green, or have poor control getting onto the dance floor for simple putts, then be sure to work on your short game.


When working on your short game, you’ll need a number of different shots in your locker. For example, the type of shot that you make will depend on where your ball is positioned, as well as the location of the pin.
So, if you’re near a raised green, you’ll need to play a very different shot than if the green was beneath you. In short, you need a few strings to your bow if you want to master the short game of golf.
Whether you’re a beginner or a regular out on the course, taking heed of the following tips will help you with your ball control and improve your overall scores too.;
, You will play a pitch shot when positioned from three to thirty yards off the green. A pitch shot typically rolls roughly the same distance on the green as it does travelling through the air. In light of this, you need to make some adjustments to your stance, posture and grip.


First of all, ensure that your grip is much weaker for pitch shots. This will prevent your hands from rolling over the grip, which will affect the control of the ball.
Rotate your hands anti-clockwise, so that you can see one knuckle on your left hand (for right-handed golfers).
Next, open up your stance and set your feet closer to the ball. Set the ball further back in your stance, the further back, the steeper the trajectory of the ball upon impact.

, A completely different shot to pitching, the chip shot is perfect for when closer to the green. The ball is chipped up in the air for only a short period of time. It then travels a greater distance as it runs along the green towards the pin. It’s a relatively easy shot, one that utilises very few moving body parts.


Ensure that the ball is positioned at least two inches behind your centre. Keep your wrists, hands and lower body quiet.
Think of the chip as an extension of the putt, rather than a shorter version of a golf swing. Use your shoulders to swing the club, keeping your arms straight.

, Whilst this is one of the most difficult short-game shots you can make, it’s certainly the most useful when you just miss the green. It will enable you to get up and down easily, without the ball rolling too much when on the green.


On the approach, open up your body completely, with your feet, waist and shoulders all in the direction of the target line.
Ensure you make a full swing, cocking your wrists as you do to create an ‘L’ shape between your arms and the wedge. As you swing and follow-through you want the club face to stay open, and then finish as normal with the club pointing towards the sky.

, Along with the lob shot, the bunker shot is equally difficult to master. However it’s vital to get right, because if you can’t get out of the bunker in a single (at most two) attempt, then you’ll be looking at chalking up quite a big score.


Use your sand wedge and stand firm with the bunker for added control.
Open up your body and always strike the ball with an open face. The key to successful bunker shots is the follow-through.
Use a full swing and aim to hit just under the ball, taking half an inch of sand.
Be sure to completely follow-through and hold your pose as you would with normal golf shots.

Grip with your four fingers under the disc and thumb near the edge on top.,
Give yourself a 3-step run-up for a drive, ending on your dominant foot.,
Step forward with your dominant foot, raising the disc to roughly chest height.,
Step ahead with the left foot, pointing it perpendicular to the basket.,
Take a final step forward, shifting your weight onto this foot as your body uncoils.,
Pull the disc straight across your body as you release.,
Throw your arm fluidly at the target, releasing it when the disc points directly at the target.,
Follow through with your throwing hand palm-up, pointing to the target and letting your body spill forward.",How to Play Disc Golf1," You want a nice, tight grip on the disc, as you'll be ""ripping"" it out of your hands when you release the disc. Your four fingers should all be inside the lip on the underside of the disc. Your thumb is on top, on the softer part of the disc and close to the edge.









Make sure your arm and wrist are loose, allowing them to move freely as you throw.
For precision shots, some players extend their forefinger along the outside rim of the disc. This lowers power but increases accuracy for some people during putts or mid-range shots.;
, So, if you're a righty, you start your run up with the right foot. Square your shoulders up to the basket and work on taking three smooth steps up.









This is sometimes called the ""X-Step."", This is step one of a good drive. If you're a righty, step with the right foot and raise the disc just below your pecs. As you turn, your body will naturally turn away from the basket.

, As you do, continue rotating your body so that your back is turning towards the basket in front of you. Again, this is for a righty. This naturally coils your body back, turning your shoulders, hips, and the disc back behind you.


You should end this step with the disc behind you, body swiveled away from the basket. Think of a spring or coil being wound up, ready to release with power.

, As you take this final step, let your body naturally rotate back towards your front foot. Keep the disc ""flat"" the other time, leaving it at the same height as you started at as the disc comes around your chest. Your back leg will naturally pull forward, and your shoulders, hips, and head should turn to face the basket.

, You don't want to arc the disc around you, nor do you want to windmill or curl around the disc. For a straight throw, you want to pull the disc straight across your chest. To do so, start by pointing the disc straight ahead of you, at your target. With your first step, pull the disc straight back as your turn. For the release, bend at the elbow as you pull the disc in a straight line towards the basket. As you pass your chest, you'll feel your elbow naturally unbending in order to keep the disc on a straight line.







, You want to think about your power coming smoothly from your hips, moving up from your footwork to your wrist. A good way to think about this is by thinking about your body as it ""uncoils."" The smoother you make these motions, the better your throw. In order, your body should rotate from the hips, through the shoulders, along the elbow, and finally releasing with a flick of the wrist. If you let your momentum carry your body around in this order your throws will be smooth and accurate.









This is a bit like a baseball batter uncoiling from the feet up to hit a fastball., As you finish, make sure you keep your palm up. This will keep you from turning or spinning the disc on release, which leads to inaccurate throws.

"
"
Grow your disc collection for specific shots and properties.,
Work on a strong, flat throw for maximum distance on your backhand.,
Angle the disc to curve it around tricky objects.,
Understand that you don't always want to approach the disc straight on.,
Focus on technique, not full power, to throw it further.,
Learn other types of throws to greatly increase your range.",How to Play Disc Golf2," There are thousands of discs on the market, and many of them have remarkably different flight patterns. Each disc is made for a certain type of shot and thrower, and you should experiment with different styles. When shopping, it is helpful to understand the basic terminology:



Overstable means that the disc fades strongly to the left for right-handed throwers, and right for left-handers, when thrown backhand.

Understable means that a disc fades to the right for righties, and to the left for lefties, when thrown backhand.

Speed & Glide tells you how hard you can throw a disc to get distance on it, and how long it stays in the air. Higher speed discs are harder to throw accurately, and high glide is harder to control. However, when mastered, you will throw for greater distances overall.

Basic vs. Premium Plastics determine how long a disc will last after landing, hitting trees, and wear and tear. Higher quality plastics often have better grip, as well., A long-distance throw comes not from working out, but from smooth, consistent technique. The best advice is to keep your disc ""flat,"" or perpendicular to the ground. As the disc rises, it catches more wind and almost always hooks off, heading sharply to the left with right-handers.


When releasing, focus on keeping the nose of the disc down. 10-20 feet off the ground generally leads to the best throws.
If the nose is up, the disc usually rises and then breaks hard down to the left (for righties)., Curving in disc golf is called ""hyzer,"" and it is accomplished depending on the angle of the disc. Knowing these terms, and how to accomplish each type of throw, greatly increases your skills and shots on the links. All of these descriptions are for a right-handed thrower, but easily reverse for lefties.










Hyzer: When the outside edge is lower than your grip, tilting the disc to the left. This makes the disc curve left when thrown.

Anhyzer: When the grip edge is lower than the outer edge, tilting the disc to the right. This makes the disc curve to the right.

S-Curve: Throwing a nose-up anhyzer throw -- remember that a nose up disc breaks left near the end but an anhyzer breaks right in the beginning. This lets you get a curvy S-shaped path if you can pull it off.

, Learning to hone your hyzers in combination with your throwing angle separates the pros from amateurs. Note how your drives normally break and compensate accordingly.


Need to curve the disc left? Start on the back left of the tee and approach diagonally to the upper right, still aiming towards the basket. This will naturally tilt your disc slightly.
Need to get the disc up high, like up a hill? This will point your nose up, which drags the shot left. Approach diagonally towards the right to compensate.

, It seems paradoxical, but most disc golfers note that they hit longer drives when they use only 80% of their power, focusing the rest of their energy on perfect technique. Trying to throw too hard usually leads to tense muscles, which greatly impacts your accuracy.The number one indicator of disc distance is the arm speed used to throw. This is important to note, as speed is usually a factor of form -- having a relaxed but concise throwing motion without locking up or getting tense --and not a factor of pure strength.

, The backhand throw will suffice for 90% of your shots, if not more, but that doesn't mean you can't extend your shot selection to hit tricky angles. Some of the most common other shots include:










Forehand: Instead of turning your body in, then uncoiling, you point with your non-throwing foot, then follow through across your body. This has less power, but reverses your normal curve on the shot, making it a good way to get a hook or slice without trying having to point the nose in a remarkably different angle.Hammer Throw: You throw the disc overhand, up high, releasing with a snap of the wrist as the disc gets above your head. Hold the disc like normal, and bring it back behind your head, turning it so that the top of the disc points to the ground. With a short overhand throw (like you were throwing a hammer), toss the disc up, keeping the top of the disc pointed to the ground. This leads to a short, straight, and high shot perfect for getting over an obstacle right in front of you."

Get yourself a basic set of 1-3 discs.,
Find a course near you by looking at parks, campgrounds, campuses, and rec centers.,
Start each shot on the flat tee at the beginning of each hole.,
Take every shot within one step of where the last shot landed.,
Note the out-of-bounds (OB) areas on each hole, adding a stroke if the disc lands here.,
Finish the hole by landing the disc in the cage at the bottom of the basket.,
Add up the number of throws you took to hit the basket to your score, keeping track of each hole.,
Determine throwing order by the lowest score on the previous holes.,
Crown the winner as the person who took the least total strokes throughout the course.,
Remain courteous, helpful, and clean to keep our free courses open to the public.",How to Play Disc Golf3," An initial set usually consists of a Driver, a Mid-range, and a Putter. There are a few select courses that have pro shops, some that even rent discs. However, this is the exception and not the rule, so it is advised to find a local retailer (Dick's and Sam's each carry discs) or purchase a beginner's set online. You should get three discs.



Midrange cover everything in-between your drive and final putt. If you're only looking to get one disc, get a midrange, like the Roc or the Buzzcraft. They are shaped like normal Frisbees, easy to throw, and stay relatively straight. If offered, aim for a ""stability rating"" at or below 1.0.

Drivers have a sharp, pointed rim. They go the farthest but are the hardest to keep accurate. Again, beginners should aim for a stable, basic driver to begin with. Do not get an overstable driver to begin -- these tend to curve harshly.

Putters: are soft and round. They glide well but don't throw incredibly far, allowing your to drift towards the basket without overshooting., Most disc golf courses are free to play, and almost none require calling or reserving ahead of time. If you're unsure about the courses near you, check out DG Course Review.com, a user-made website listing all known courses along with ratings, maps, pictures, and even some shot recommendations for tricky holes.


When you arrive, look to see if there is a course map and grab one now. Courses aren't always well mapped. If there is only a single map, take a picture with your phone

, On some courses there will be multiple tees depending on your skill level, with those closer to the hole made for beginners and those far away for advanced players. Before shooting, note the location of your basket by consulting the diagram near the tee. DG courses can be tight, leading to basket confusion if you're unsure of the hole.

, You can change discs every shot, but you must stay within a pace of your disc. Usually, this means leaving your back foot near the disc, then leaning either way if you need help to get around an object. You can take a run-up to any shot, but you must release the disc within a food of where the last shot landed.

, If there are hole diagrams at the tee, they will indicate where is OB. Water is considered OB as well, so if you sink a disc you must add a stroke to your current hole. If you retrieve a disc from OB, you take your next throw from the closest in-bounds areas to where your disc sailed out-of-bounds. It should be the closest open area, but you should not move any closer to the hole than the spot where you went OB., You do not simply need to hit the chains, although they do help drop the disc into the hole. The disc must land in the cage in the basket in order to be counted.









The only exception is if the disc lands on top of the basket. This counts as ""in the hole."", These are called ""strokes,"" and they work just like normal golf. Every throw equals one stroke, and the lowest score wins. So, if you took four throws to finish a hole, then you have four strokes. If the next hole takes you three strokes, your score is now seven.


Remember to add strokes for OB or water traps. So, if you take four throws to hit the basket, but one of them went OB, then the hole took five strokes.

, Whoever won the previous hole throws first on the next one. If there is a tie, then the player with the lowest total score throws next. If there is still a tie, then alternate players with the first throw until someone takes the lead., Just like golf, you want to have the lowest score in order to win. This simply means it took the winner fewer throws than everyone else to complete the same holes, making them the day's leader., Disc golf is an amazingly community-driven sport. Most courses are free because people volunteer to keep them clean and playable, and users share the course graciously. Never act like you own the course, and always remember to share the inclusive, kind, and DIY spirit that makes the sport so special by:


Keeping quiet, especially when others are throwing
Letting faster groups of players ""play through,"" by waiting one hole for them to pass you.
Pick up trash and respect local trees, plants, and wildlife.
Communicate when disc may hit someone, and stand behind throwers whenever possible."

Place more on weight on your front foot to carve in the direction of your turn.",How to Ride a Penny Board," Close-toed, flat-soled shoes are the best for riding on a penny board. You want to ensure that your toes aren’t exposed in case you trip or fall. The flat sole will let you feel and grip the entire board.


Canvas shoes like Vans or Chuck Taylors work well.;
, This is important if you’ve never learned how to ride a skateboard. Placing your board on a flat surface will allow you more control when standing, preventing it from sliding around.


Stand on a patch of gravel or patch of grass to lock the board in place. Although it will be more painful if you fall, on gravel, these surfaces will hold you steady while you learn to stand on the board.
Hold onto something for balance. If you are near a handrail or a wall, hold onto it to help you balance.

, This is the foot that you won’t use for kicking and it will always be in front of your other foot to for balance. Your body should be facing forward.


Some skaters will ride mongo, which means you push with your front foot (usually dominant foot). Mongo pushing involves keeping the foot on the back of the board, not the front.Regular skaters will lead with the left foot and face right when moving forward.
Goofy skaters lead with the right foot and face left when moving forward.

, Practice picking this foot up and down while you find balance on the board with your other foot.


Balance on your board with one foot and get a feel for how easily your board wobbles. Knowing how far you can lean before losing your balance will help you when ridging and turning,
If you feel your board wobble too much, tighten your trucks. The trucks are the metal parts of your board that connect to the wheels and deck. Use a unit tool designed for skateboards to adjust the trucks. With your tool, turn the kingpin to the right until you feel a tightness., Move your front foot around on the board until you feel comfortable. If you are having a hard time balancing, try placing your foot closer to the center while you kick with the other.


Shift your dominant foot back using the ball and heel of your foot until you feel your entire foot pressing down on the board.
The farther back you move your front foot, the more shifting you may have to do when actually riding with both feet on the board.
Try to keep your foot positioned so that the front of your shoe covers at least the bottom two screws in the front.

, Turn your front foot at a 45-degree angle to the board. Place your back foot behind the back truck at a 90-degree angle to the edge of the board.


The back foot will be perpendicular to the board. Place your foot where the lip curve meets the flat body of the board.When shifting and turning your front foot, lift up your heel and turn on the ball of your foot.
Goofy skaters will have the right foot positioned at the front; regular skaters will have the left foot at the front.

, Make sure there isn’t any traffic when you are practicing, since you will have less control than usual when you first start riding.


It’s best to find a quiet street or empty parking lot to practice in.
Look for somewhere where you will have room to push a few times.
Make sure the area you are skating on doesn’t have large cracks, bumps, or rocks.

, Place your front foot on the board behind the front screws and find your balance. Lift your other foot off of the ground and make sure you feel comfortable on the board.


Adjust your foot as needed, moving it forward or back until you feel confident and comfortable.

, Kick off from the ball of your foot that’s on the ground with a light step. Don’t go too fast too soon.









Keep most of your weight on the leg and foot that’s on the board. Focus your weight on the big front toe. Keep your knee slightly bent.

, Don’t allow your foot to touch the ground for too long, or your may lose your balance.








With your kicking foot, push off with the ball of your foot, like you’re kicking dust backwards.
Make longer strides when pushing. A long, smooth stride will keep you consistent and make balancing easier.

, Once you’ve gained enough speed and you feel comfortable, place your pushing (back) foot on the board. At this point, turn your feet and body sideways, twisting your neck to see where you are going.









Your front foot should be at about a 45-degree angle and your back foot should be perpendicular to the board.
If you need to adjust your front foot, slide it forward or backward using the outer edge of your foot.
Place your back foot where the lip of the board meets the body, right where the four back screws are.
Keep your knees bent slightly and center your gravity in the middle of the board.
Extend your arms out to help you stay balanced.

, Transition between pushing and coasting until you feel comfortable and confident in your balance. Practice extensively before you try penny boarding in busier areas.


Keep playing around with the placement of your feet and the bend in your knees. Make small adjustments until your coasting stance feels natural.

, You want your front foot at an angle between 45- and 90-degrees to the board as you coast. You will be facing sideways, and you should choose an angle that gives you optimal control on your terrain.


You might find, as you begin, that it even feels comfortable to keep your front foot mostly straight.
Finding a comfortable placement for your front foot is important because it steers your penny board and keeps it situated under you.

, Understand that you will have limited ability to turn while your trucks are tight. If you are still practicing kicking and coasting on the board, it is better to keep the trucks tight until you feel confident in your balance.









Turning on your penny board involves shifting your weight either forward on the balls of your feet, or back on your heels. By pressing down on either edge of the board, you lean on your trucks causing you to turn.

, Take your tool and and locate the kingpin, which is the large nut in the center of your truck. Turn the nut to the right to tighten, and to the left to loosen.Tighter trucks create less wobble, making you feel like you have more stability for balance. However, if your trucks are really tight, you’ll have to lift your board up to turn.
Since the penny board is small, you may find it easier to loosen your trucks slightly as turning will be much easier.
Looser trucks allow the shifting of your weight to better compress the bushings on one side. The bushings are the colored rubber parts on your trucks. The bushings allow the hanger, the large “T” shaped part of your truck, to pivot creating a turn.
Don’t make your trucks too loose as this will not only make it harder to balance, but if your trucks are too loose, the nut could get dislodged if you hit rocky terrain.

, Keep kicking consistently until you reach an adequate speed before your turn. If you’re going too slow, you may not have the momentum to make the turn. Too fast and you are likely to fall.









If you are going too fast, you’ll feel your board start to wobble. These are called speed wobbles and it makes it hard to turn your board as it may slip out from under your feet.
When learning how to ride a penny board, keep your turns wide by making large carves. Take your time turning. If you’re in an open area, slowly shift your weight to begin your turn and move in a large arch.

, Keeping your back foot perpendicular to the board, slid it up the lip. It can be on the very back of the deck to help you turn at a sharper angle.


The sharper you turn, the more you should bend your knees to keep your balance.
To do a kick turn, a sharp turn where you lift the front wheels off the board and pivot, make sure your back foot is on the tail. Place most of your weight on your back foot and press down, while swinging the board around with your front foot., Your front foot will guide the board on your turn. As the plastic deck tips, the wheels will turn in the direction that you are pointing the deck.Guiding your turns with your front foot is known as carving. This is how you normally turn your board.
You will still shift the weight of your back foot for a carving turn as well, but your front foot does most of the steering!

Even experienced golfers can miss a shot here or there without a scorecard. Keep track of your score and the scores of the other players in your group.


Typically, you are responsible for keeping the score of your opponent, and your opponent is responsible for keeping track of yours. After every round, you have to look over your opponent's card, agree that he has written down your score correctly, and sign or initial it. You'll also have to do this at the very end of the round. So if your opponent makes a mistake (even assuming it's an honest one) that somehow makes your score worse than it should be, you have to take the blame for it.
Other players designate one person to be in charge of keeping score for all of the players before the game begins.;
, It's likely that 99.9% of the time a golfer will make contact with the ball. But if he/she tries to hit the ball and whiffs, it still counts as a shot. On the other hand, if you take a practice swing and accidentally hit the ball, it doesn't count. Every time you take a swing at the ball, therefore, it counts as a stroke, whether anything good happens or not.


Each hole will have a number of strokes listed under ""Par"". This is the average amount of strokes it should take to get the ball in the hole. If the par is 3 and you make a 4, then your score can be viewed as 1-over. If the par for the course is 80 and you finished the course with a 95, then your score is 15-over.
Though you don't have to know them to keep score, you should know that a birdie is one stroke under par, an eagle is two under par, and a bogey is one over par.
Some players decide that they can take no more strokes for each hole than a double bogey, or 2 points over par., Penalties are shots that cost you extra points. Remember that you want your score to be as low as possible, and the penalties drive them up. Here are some penalties:


If you hit a ball in the water, drop a new ball in the designated location and take a 1-stroke penalty.
If you hit the ball out of bounds (as indicated by white stakes), re-hit from the original location and take a 2-stroke penalty.
If you lose a ball, re-hit from the original location and take a 2-stroke penalty.

, When you're finished, add up your scores from each hole for a cumulative total. Double check it. If you're playing in a tournament, one of your competitors will be keeping your official score. You must check it and then sign your scorecard to make it official. The player with the least amount of points wins the game.


Some players add up the points every 9 holes so that they don't have to do too many calculations at the end and can settle disputes over the score more easily.

, Once you've played at least ten rounds of golf on the same course (or however many rounds you have to play for the course to determine your handicap), you'll have a handicap. A handicap takes into account your previous scores throughout the same previous round of golf, and you can play the game while keeping your handicap in mind. (The goal is to do better than you previously did.)If you want to get fancy with the handicap, then you can play using the Stableford method. In this scoring method, your golf score is made not of a number of strokes you get per hole, but a number of net points you get per hole. If your net score is equal to the par, you get 2 points; if you hit one over par (a bogey), you get 1 point. If you get 1 under par (a birdie), you get 3 points, and if you hit 2 under par (an eagle), you get 4 points. The player with the most points wins."

Learn how to stop first!,
Keep your front trucks looser than your back trucks.,
Stay calm.,
Keep most of your weight over the front truck.,
Bail out only if you absolutely have to.,
Ride away smoothly once you're at the bottom.








",How to Ride Downhill on a Skateboard," The most common and safe method is to footbrake. Take your back foot off of the board and slide it along the ground until you slow down and stop.









If you're comfortable enough on the board, you can also tailslide. With your back foot on the tail, push down on it so the tail drags along the ground. Lean forward so the board doesn't slide out. This is not recommended by most people because it tears up the tail of your board.
An alternative to tail-sliding that doesn't tear up your tail is to heel-slide. It's the same thing as a tailslide except your back foot's heel is hanging over the back of the tail, so the heel of your shoe slides on the ground instead of the tail sliding on the ground.;
, Wobbles start in the back, so it is good to have the front trucks looser than the back trucks. Just make sure that they are not too tight or it might be harder to carve/turn. This is the best thing to do because this will help minimize your wobbling when you are going fast. As you get more comfortable with your abilities, you can start to loosen your trucks.

, When you get nervous or afraid, you put tension in your muscles which can cause you to over correct each turn. If you stay relaxed and loose, the likelihood of getting speed wobbles is dramatically reduced.








, Crouching with your knees while going downhill will also reduce speed wobbling. Don't crouch too low. Also remember to keep your legs fairly loose, otherwise you may get additional speed wobbles from your muscles tensing. If you begin to experience speed wobbles try to loosen up your legs and slowly straighten up your stance. Keeping your weight over your front trucks will also help to minimize speed wobble and give you better control over your board.








, Otherwise, there are several things that you should always attempt first:









Try making very wide, deep carves to slow yourself down.
Foot brake to lose some speed by lightly dragging your foot off the deck and on the ground. This is one of the easiest and most effective ways of scrubbing off speed, especially when there isn't enough room to carve. Bailing should be done only as a last resort, but if necessary try to bail onto grass or make sure that you roll when you fall.

Anchor your foot.,
Touch your elbow to your hip.,
Relax your muscles.,
Rotate your hips vigorously.,
Use a short controlled backswing.",How to Improve Your Golf Game1," One of the most basic tips to get greater distance is to anchor (firmly press into the ground) your foot and your body behind the ball. The foot you must anchor is the foot that is behind the ball. For right handed players it will be the right foot, and the left foot for left handed players. If you lift your foot too soon when swinging the club you will lose power and distance in the shot., If you can’t touch your elbow to your hip, at least keep your arm close to your hip. By keeping the right arm close to the hip, you ensure the body will drive your arms and club through the ball impact. This will decrease the chances of your hands negatively influencing the shot.Keep your left arm close to your hip if you’re left-handed.

, Relax and keep your grip light. At the top of your backswing, make a slight pause and maintain a light grip through the swing. To keep a light grip, relax the muscles in your forearms and also your fingers. If you do this, you will create a faster, brisker swing release through the ball impact. This will result in a longer drive.Take deep, even breaths to help relax.

, By energetically rotating you hips on the downswing you will bring your core muscles into play. This will increase club head speed, and therefore will result in a longer drive. Make sure you do this in a controlled manner. Keep your foot anchored to prevent slicing the ball.Slicing the ball is when the golf ball curves dramatically from the left to the ball after a shot.

, Do this to achieve a longer drive. A common failure amongst golfers is bringing the driver too far back during the backswing. This causes a loss in control of the club. A powerful, more controlled swing can achieved by controlling your wrists and rotating your body into the shot, thus resulting in a more distance.Your hands should be level with your shoulders when you bring the club back.

Score each hole as ""holes up"" or ""holes down."",
Concede a hole if necessary.,
Keep track of who has won each hole.,
End the game when one player is more holes up than there are holes remaining.,
Don't obsess over how many shots you're taking.",How to Keep Score in Golf2," This is a great way to play for beginners, and you don't have to be as meticulous about keeping track of exactly what happened in every single round. All you have to do is win more holes than your opponent. So, let's say that your score on the first hole was 5 and your opponent's score on the first hole was three; your opponent is now ""one up"" because your opponent is one hole ahead of you., If you're having an impossible time getting the ball into a hole during a certain round and would rather save your energy and sanity, then you can give up that hole and move on to the next. You get a clean start in the next hole.

, Continue to play and write down who has won each hole after every round. Just write +1 if you're up a hole for a certain round or -1 if you're down for that round. If you and your opponent got the ball in the hole with the same amount of strokes, you can write ""AS"" under the hole and consider it a draw.

, Matches can be one by scores of ""four and three."" This means that one player will win after being four holes ahead with only three holes remaining (after the 15th hole) since the other player will not have the opportunity to win back enough holes to win the round.

, If you're a beginner, it's more important to focus on getting the ball in the hole than being upset about taking too many shots. This way, you'll be more focused on falling into a rhythm than overanalyzing your game. As you become more advanced, you can work on marking down every one of your shots and making room for improvement.

Apply impact tape to the head of your club.,
Take a practice swing to see where the ball hits the impact tape.,
If the ball mark is on the end of the club head, you may need to move the club head slightly away from your body.,
Start with a new piece of impact tape after you're hit a few balls.",How to Hit the Golf Club's Sweet Spot by Using Impact Tape1," Start with a pitching wedge or 9 iron.;
, You will notice the dimples from the golf ball on the impact tape.

, This means that you need to line the ball up between the middle of the club head and the heel of the club head. Keep inching the club head forward or back, depending where your mark is on the impact tape. If the ball mark is closer to the toe of the club, you need to line up somewhere between the middle of the club head and the toe.

, This lets you get a clean picture of where you are impacting the tape.

"
"
Let the club do the work.,
Don’t rush the shot.,
Visualize the shot.,
Reduce spinning by teeing the ball higher.,
Practice as often as possible.",How to Improve Your Golf Game2," A common misconception amongst golfers is that the harder they whack the ball, the further it will go. You should actually focus on the middle of the ball and the control you have over your swing. This will give you far better results than trying to increase the power of your swing. Hitting the ball too hard will invariably mean a slice or a fresh air shot., Try not to tense up before making the shot. Concentrate on controlling your swing, and the club will do the rest for you. Once you have mastered controlling your golf swing, you can then gradually increase the power you use when driving the ball.Instead of muscling the shot, use your left hand to control the club during the swing. Use your right hand if you’re left-handed.

, When taking your practice swings, imagine the shot you wish to hit. Picture the ball’s flight when you make your practice swing. Make sure your swing feels comfortable. This technique will relax your body as well as your mind. Also, never take too many practice swings, as the thought of fluffing the shot will build up in your mind and affect your confidence., Hit the drives with minimal spin on the ball. To achieve this, you can tee the ball up high. This will promote less spin on the ball as you will be hitting it from a more underneath position. Also, try to avoid moving forward over the ball on impact. This will always reduce spin., Consistency in the amount of times you get out there and play is crucial to a good game. To hone your golfing skills, you must play regularly. You will not improve if you don’t practice. You will learn to tweak your game a little bit more each time you play, and bring the lessons you learned the previous week to the course with you the following week."

Choose a good set of clubs.,
Choose a good ball.,
Take lessons.,
Keep fit.",How to Improve Your Golf Game3," Even for professionals, the type of clubs used matters. The type of clubs you choose depends on if you’re at a beginner, intermediate, or advanced level. A set of three woods and eight irons is sufficient if you’re a beginner. Most club sets will work for a beginner. Make sure the clubs fit your strength and posture. Once you reach the intermediate level, a good set of clubs are ones that have been fitted for you.Sometimes bigger clubs are better because it means greater inertia.

, You can use any type of ball, but some balls are better than others. You want a ball that will go the farthest distance. Yardage is more important than spin. Look for a ball that is not too light or heavy.Ask for the advice of an employee at your local sports equipment store if you’re not sure which golf balls to choose.
It’s not necessary to go for the most expensive option if you’re just playing for fun., Taking golf lessons is a sure way to improve your game. They are especially helpful for beginners. Golf lessons can help you learn etiquette, improve technique, learn technical aspects, and familiarize yourself with your equipment. This, however may not work for everyone because lessons can be costly.You can sign up for golf lessons at country clubs, gold academies, and from private instructors.

, As with any game, you need a certain level of fitness to maintain the ability to play well. To keep fit, you can stretch, go to the gym, and/or enjoy any other physical activity. Stretch your hamstrings, quads, arms, and back before playing. Try to go to the gym at least twice a week. For physical activities, you can run, do yoga, or play other sports.Only do as much physical activity outside of golfing as you are comfortable with. Don’t put too much strain on your body.

Use the correct club.",How to Learn to Play Golf1," Your face, shoulders, hips, and feet should all be facing the ball before you swing. Your body should be parallel to the hole. Make sure that your feet are shoulder width apart for maximum balance. Lean forward slightly as you position the club to the ball., Place your dominant hand below your non-dominant hand. Keep your arms straight. Since you are leaning forward, your arms will be hanging down below your chin.For example, if you are right handed, your right hand will be closer to the ground.

, Move the club back away from the ball. If you are right handed, you move the club backwards to the right. Your right elbow should bend slightly, but your left elbow will remain straight. Your shoulders will twist slightly. Raise the club until it is somewhere between hip and shoulder height. This should feel comfortable. Do not force your body to swing the club high.If you are left handed this will be reversed. You will bring the club backwards to the left, bending your left elbow and keeping your right elbow straight.

, Swing the club forcefully towards the ball. If you are right handed, you will swing the club to the left. Once you hit the ball, follow through with your club. Allow the club to continue to swing over your left shoulder. At this point, both of your elbows will be bent.


Keep your eye on the ball the entire time. Look where you want the ball to go before you swing.
If you are left handed you will swing the club to the right.

, As you get closer to the hole, you will want to change your swing slightly. When you putt, use a shorter backswing. Lightly tap the ball. The ball should roll on the ground instead of flying through the air. Continue your follow through and keep your eye on the ball at all times., There are several different types of clubs in a set of golf clubs. The driver is the club that is used for long distance. This should be used on your first hit. The putter is the club that is used for short distances. An iron is used for hits that are less than 200 yards away. Hybrid clubs have been developed recently to be used in place of drivers and irons."
"
Look around you before you putt.,
Set the ball near your front foot.,
Swing the putter.,
Strike the ball with slight speed.,
Follow through with your club.",How to Improve Your Putting1," Unlike full shots that have to do with the air, putting is all about the contour of the ground. Look at all your putts from behind the hole and from a 90-degree angle. This will give you a clear idea of the distance and elevation of the ground before you putt. , The ball should be square to the line of target and your eyes should be over the ball. Let your arms hang loosely and hold the putter lightly. Make sure to keep your hands level or ahead of the ball through the stroke. , Move the putter backward smoothly. Use your shoulders to hinge your arms, not your elbows or wrist. Keep your putter in line with the target as your swing it backward and then forward. Maintain your tempo through the swing. , The putter head should strike the back of the ball during the upswing. It should feel like the palm of your right hand is striking towards the target. The best strokes look very smooth because the club is being swung backward and forward at the same speed. The strike should feel more like a “roll” rather than a “hit.” This will give you better distance control and keep the ball from rolling too far past the hole. , Don’t follow through with your eyes. Keep eye contact on the spot where the ball was, not where it is going. Don’t allow yourself to look up right away, count for two second before you look to see how well you did. Many golfers make the mistake of having a short follow through and not paying attention to the force of their follow through. Make a long follow through to the hole, it should not be shorter than the takeaway. "

If you are taller, you will want them spread further apart. It's best to start off with one of the beginner boards, as they are generally more affordable. Once you've learnt to ride and fallen in love with streetboarding, you can always upgrade your board.;
, The hardest thing about streetboarding, is learning to ride the board! Expect to fall over a couple of times - Be prepared for it! A small fall on your knees on concrete can really hurt, but with pads you won't feel a thing and you will be much more confident. Remember, if you feel like you are going to fall, just bend your knees and squat down.

, Find yourself a smooth, level surface such as a carpark or tennis court where you can practise streetboarding. Start off by standing with one foot on each footplate. It will feel very weird and unstable at first, until you find your balance. You might want to find a railing or wall to hold onto, as you will probably start to roll when you don't want to!

, Don't try to roll anywhere yet. Whilst getting comfortable with standing on the board, practise the basic movements. Turn your toes together (pigeon-toed) and then turn them apart. Keep repeating this until you are comfortable with it. This is the core element of streetboarding.

Length of the putter is important for a sound setup and for your hand-eye coordination. , The loft, the angle of the club face, lifts the ball from the depression it makes on the green and gives the ball a backspin. Adjust the loft of your club so it comes at the ball straight on. The lie angle, the angle between the center shaft and the ground, can negatively affect a golfer’s set up and stroke. Keep the lie angle where your natural set up is so you don’t mess up your stroke. , If the club is too light it will make it swerve during the follow through. Add more weight to your club if you notice a jerky motion and difficulty controlling the club. Use a lighter head weight for faster greens and heavier weights for slower greens. If you tend to miss putts in a certain side of the putter, add weight to that side.

, Although there are many different ways to grip the club, when putting keep your grip large. This will keep your wrists from breaking and the putter from being manipulated. Having a large grip will keep the swing in your shoulders, giving you more control. "

You can also get skate shoes, which are special shoes designed to last longer and grip better on a skateboard. They are much better than the average sneakers. You can buy them at places like Journeys, or you can buy them at special skate shops with tons of skating gear. Good brands include Vans, DC Shoes, and Adidas.;
, Some of the first basics you learn will improve as you work, and will be some of the things you will need to do to start moving into the advanced tricks, like kickflips and grinds. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the basic push,(also known as ""pumping"")the kickturn, the regular turn with your heel and toes, and the stopping position. Keep practicing and you will soon move into more advanced things, such as dropping in, and going down larger ramps.

, Some skate parks offer special private lessons, free skate, and special skate clinics over the weekends. If you can, try going outside at least once a week to practice all that you have learned. Trust yourself, that all of this practice will eventually become really good.

This is exactly the same position as the regular pressure flip. This trick is almost all in the big toe of back foot, so this step is pretty important.

Your front foot can be wherever it is comfortable, perhaps just under the bolts at an angle. Make sure your heel is hanging off as it makes it easier to get the ""no comply"" part down more easily.;
, When you're rolling and you feel ready to execute the trick, position your feet as described in the step above. If you're not used to pressure flips, it will feel really awkward at first because your back foot should be at a weird angle., This causes the board to pop, either vertically or diagonally if your back foot is in the correct position. When the board pops, scoop under and push forward with your back foot. Remember, only your big toe should be used to pop the board, the rest of your back foot should be off. This doesn't require much effort, just a little nudge.

Since your front foot is on the floor, the jump is pretty simple. Once you scoop the board jump up with your back foot and wait for it to do a full rotation, it should spin like an inward heel flip.

, When you're ready to land, jump up with your front foot (slightly later than your back foot, which jumps as soon as it has scooped). It's a front foot catch, so just hop on and ride away. Your back foot should land nicely on the back bolts.

You may land sketchy a lot to start with, but that's more likely down to the scoop or the push.

Lean your upper torso more so forward than our hips and legs and shift your weight forward when it is needed, as gravity will being pulling you backwards, but also you can shift back if too much weight if shifted.,
Then when you are done, or cannot hold the trick any longer just let push back down and roll away like usual.

",How to Manual Easily on a Skateboard," Have the edge of your back foot nicely lined up with the tail, but with your shoe still completely on the board except your heel. As this is all about balance and endurance, you will need to keep a proper stance throughout the entire manual.It will shift as your weight does and the ground surface changes depending on inclines or declines. Stay on the balls of your feet and your toes and strain them hard when you actually start the manual.;
, Others may prefer it at any other area of the nose of the board, but I believe you are widening your stance and allowing too much pressure on the nose if too far up, which could cause a wipe-out when you push down too hard if it is not taken back to the bolts quick enough. So I advise keeping the front foot on the bolts until you learn the manual better, then you can adapt it to your style.

, it should be pushing against your front foot quite hard from the pressure from your back foot. As you feel the balance between these 2 pressures you will also have to put your hands up and balance as well as you can, it will take a while to actually feel the balance and also be able to physically sustain that stance for the period the manual is performed.

, And you must find that 50/50 ratio of balance which is genuinely tricky to hold for long periods, especially without a decline.

Have fun but be careful.",How to Longboard Skateboard," Are you looking for a board to cruise on around town? To hit the skatepark with? Or are you looking to rip down big hills?


Different sized longboards have different advantages and disadvantages. Shorter longboards are more agile (meaning you can turn more) but less stable (meaning it's easier to fall over). Longer boards are more stable but less agile. Beginners should stick with longer boards.;
, You may not think it's the coolest way to longboard, but especially when you're practicing, it's a good idea to be padded up. If you're doing more extreme versions of longboarding, getting padded up is essential.


For gear, be sure to get:

A good-fitting helmet
Skateboarding shoes (flat bottomed)
Elbow pads (optional)
Knee pads (optional)



, Do you skate with your right foot forward? That's called riding ""goofy."" Do you skate with your left foot facing forward? That's called regular.


To find out whether you ride regular or goofy, have someone shove you from behind with no warning. Whichever foot you put out to catch yourself is the one you want to lead with on the skateboard. If it feels wrong, try switching to the other foot.
Another way to find out is to slide on a smooth surface in socks or lay on the ground; whichever foot you use to get up with will be the foot you want to lead with on your longboard.

, Try to feel the smooth flow as it rolls over the concrete. The lower you keep your center of gravity, the better you will feel. Make sure you feel comfortable before moving on.

, Stand with your feet between the trucks (the bearings that hold the wheels), a little longer than shoulder-width apart. Angle your front foot slightly forward, at about a 45 degree angle. Have your back foot be pretty much sideways, perpendicular to the direction the board is traveling in.


This is just one stance that you can use. After getting comfortable with your longboard for a little bit, you very well could find that other stances work better for you. Go with what feels comfortable.

, Get the hang of what it feels like to be on a longboard. Use your arms for balance and bend your knees a bit.

, If you feel out of control, make sure you focus far in front of you using your peripheral vision to guide you. This will allow your body to naturally gain control or balance.

, Take your back foot off the board and use the ground as something to push off of. You can go for one big push, or several smaller pushes. Try to keep your body loose as you push off; the stiffer your body is, the harder it will be to keep your balance.


If you want to use your front foot to push off, give it a try. Most boarders don't do this — it's called ""mongo"" — but it's more important do ride comfortably than do what other people do.
After you get the hang of it, practice generating more speed by doing harder kicks. You'll find that, after you've gotten to a certain speed, one good push will keep you going for quite a while.

, You'll need to practice turning on your board if you want to ride around. Turning is quite easy. All you have to do is put pressure down on one side of the board, leaning in that direction, and you'll turn:


Heel edge carving: you move your heels downward and you turn to your inside. Heel edge turns for people who ride regular give you left turns.
Toe edge carving: you move your toes downward and you turn to your outside. Toe edge turns for people who ride regular give you right turns.

, Foot-braking, where you drag one foot on the ground, is probably the most reliable way to stop or slow down: you're creating a lot of friction with your foot, thereby slowing the momentum of the board down. Other ways that you can break include:


Carving: snaking down the hill by leaning from side to side pushes on your wheels and will help keep speed down.
Air braking: at high speeds, simply standing up and putting your arms out can slow you considerably.

, If you ever want to go faster than you can run, save yourself some road rash by learning how to slide. In order to slide, you should either buy slide gloves, or attach squares of cutting board (find it in the supermarket) to work gloves. Once you have your gloves, you're ready to go learn to slide! In order to slide:


Point your front foot forward while bending your knees; shift your weight to the front.
Slide your back foot off your board, flexing your front knee to make contact with the ground.
Apply gradual pressure to stop
Try not to use your toes or heel to touch the ground; instead, opt for the middle of your sole.

, Start slow, and work your way up. Rome wasn't built in a day.

, Getting comfortable with a board takes time and the techniques work for almost any shape and size board. Hard wheels (durometer of at least 86a) break traction easier, making learning to slide easier

, Longboarding is a ton of fun, but pushing it too hard can cause serious injury. You never think it'll be you until it actually happens to you. Be mindful of potentially dangerous situations and prepare accordingly or take yourself out of them before it's too late. That being said, have a blast cruising on your new toy!

Start rolling forward and place your back foot on the tail.,
Bend your knees.,
Now, shift your weight to your back foot as you lean forward.,
Maintain your balance.,
Push your front foot down to end the manual.",How to Manual on a Skateboard1," Manuals require you to be rolling forward (though, if you have difficulty performing one, you may want to practice your manuals standing still). Roll forward at slow, controlled speed in your normal riding stance. Then, in preparation for your manual, shift your rear foot back to the tail of your board. Place it in a location that's comfortable for you. Generally, your foot should cover most of the ""curved"" portion of the tail. Your front foot should be near the middle (or on top of) the front trucks.


It probably goes without saying, but, before attempting a manual, take all necessary safety precautions. Always wear a helmet (and, optionally, elbow pads, etc.) when skateboarding. Before you get the hang of the manual, it's not unusual for the board to slip out from under you, causing you to fall backward. This can lead to serious injury if you're not adequately protected.
Additionally, ensure the surrounding area is free from obstructions that may hinder you while riding. Flat, open spaces are best for practice.;
, Balance is of the utmost importance when performing a manual. To be able to hold your manual, you need to be able to make minute adjustments to your stance to keep your weight centered and balanced. This is much harder to do if your legs are ""locked"" straight. As you roll forward, make sure there's a slight bend in your knees before attempting to manual.

, Slowly and carefully begin to put weight on your rear foot. As you do this, lean forward slightly with your upper body. The increasing pressure on your rear foot should eventually cause the front wheels of the skateboard to lift. Leaning forward allows you keep your center of mass over the board, making it less likely that the board will slip out from under you.



Don't lean back, even if it seems intuitive to do so. This is a sure-fire way to fall flat on your back.

, Hopefully, at this point, you're rolling forward with the front of your board in the air (if not, practice, practice, practice!) Now, your goal is to keep doing this for as long as you can. Listen to your natural sense of balance - if you feel yourself beginning to fall forward, lean back and put extra weight on the tail of the board. If you feel yourself beginning to fall backward, lean forward. The trick here is not to overcompensate - try to keep your movements small and controlled as you adjust your weight.


Realistically, you will probably fall down many times before you're able to get the hang of this, so elbow, wrist, and knee pads may be a good idea.
Don't get discouraged if you can't hold your manual for more than a second or so at first! Manuals require lots and lots of patient practice - at first, you may not even be used to using the muscles you need to stay balanced. Stick with it!

, Being able to start and hold a manual isn't quite the whole story - to be able to say with confidence that you know how to ""do a manual"", you need to be able to transition from a manual back to normal riding without falling down. Shift your weight slowly from your back foot to your front foot. As you do this, slowly bring your upper body (which should be leaning forward at this point) back to its normal, upright position. The front of your board should ideally fall back to the ground.

"
"
Start rolling forward with your front foot on the nose of the board and your knees bent.,
Gently press down on the nose.,
Keep your mass over the front wheels.,
To end the nose manual, push down with your back foot.",How to Manual on a Skateboard2," Performing a nose manual requires basically the exact opposite actions as a normal manual. Start rolling forward, then shift your stance so that your front foot is on the curved portion at the front of the board (the ""nose""). If it isn't already, put your rear foot on or near the rear trucks. Put a slight bend in your knees. This stance makes it possible for you to lift the rear wheels off the ground, balancing on the front wheels.

, As you roll forward, shift your weight from the center of the board onto your front foot. For balance, raise your arms away from your sides, and, if necessary, lean back ever-so-slightly. At first, this will invariably result in the board slipping out from under you. This is OK - with time, you'll develop a sense of where your center of mass is and you'll be better at keeping your balance.

, To hold your nose manual as you roll forward, you'll want your weight balanced carefully over the front set of wheels. At first, this will be exceedingly difficult, but, with practice, it will become easier. If you're having difficulty keeping your balance, try shifting your hips and/or torso to compensate for any imbalances. You may also want to experiment with using your back foot to push gently downward and maintain balance.


As soon as you are able to hold your nose manual for a second or so, start trying to hold it for longer and longer distances. With patient practice, your sense of balance will gradually improve and maintaining your balance during a nose manual will become as natural as doing so during a normal manual.

, As with normal manuals, to return to a normal riding stance, force the elevated portion of the board back down to the ground. As you do so, shift your weight back over the center of the board to make it easier to maintain control. Finally, move your feet back to their normal riding positions.

If you are concerned about falling, you might even want to start in the grass or even a carpeted surface.;
, Place your front foot near the middle of your board, about two inches from your bolts. Put your back foot on the tail.









Your front foot should be completely on the skateboard, just behind the front bolts.The ball of your back foot should align with the center of the board. This means your heel will stick out, off the board's surface.Both feet should face straight ahead. Do not angle either foot on the board., You'll need to bend your knees so you can both pop the tail and jump up.







, Rapidly and forcefully push down hard on the tail of your board with your back foot








The downward force you apply to the tail of the skateboard will cause it to strike the ground, resulting in powerful upward momentum on the board as it ""pops"" up., Immediately after popping the tail, straighten your legs to jump up into the air.








, Slide the side of your front foot along the surface of the board as the front end comes up.








The friction of your foot rubbing against the rough grip tape will help drag the board upward along with your body., Bring up your back foot and level the board underneath you with your feet as you reach the high point of your jump. You may need to push down slightly on your front foot to get the board level with your shoulders.







, Extend your legs to the ground as you drop, keeping your knees bent to absorb the shock of landing.








Keeping your knees bent is important both for avoiding knee injury and keeping control of the board.

, Determining the right amount of force to apply on the tail to make the pop happen the way it should is one of the trickiest parts of learning this maneuver.









You need to push down hard and fast enough to not only lift the front end of the board, but also cause the tail to strike the ground with enough force to cause it to bounce upward off the ground.The harder you slam the board down, the higher up it will bounce.That said, when you are first trying to master this, keeping control is more important than a high jump. Experiment with different amounts of force until you get to the point where you can pop the board without losing control, and then work on increasing the height of the pop.

, Equally difficult is the sweep of your foot that pulls the board upward with you as you jump and also keeps it pointed in the direction you want it to go. This will likewise require a fair amount of trial and error.









You need to keep your front foot relaxed enough to roll the ankle slightly.Your first impulse might be to tense up these muscles, and you will need to learn to resist that urge.
To keep control, you must use the friction between the edge of your shoe and the board as you execute the sweep, which should take your foot all the way to the front edge of the board., Another challenging part of doing this trick correctly is getting the timing right. Although the steps should be carried out in the order described in Part 1, you need to carry these steps out very rapidly, in just a fraction of second.








In particular, the pop and the jump need to be carried out at almost the same time, essentially in one motion. The timing is everything here, and will take practice., Lastly, landing without falling off the board can be a real trick. The key here is to both keep your knees bent and get your board level before it lands.









Ideally, you want to land all four wheels at the same time.Keep your shoulders level throughout the process. Resist the temptation to lean forward as you perform this maneuver, as doing so may cause you to fall off the front of the board when you land.

, Once you've go the basic technique down, you can start working on making this trick look a little more impressive. The first step is learning to execute the ollie while the board is moving.








Get your board rolling at a comfortable speed and give it a try, executing the move in the same way and with your feet in the same position as you did when the board was stationary., The next step is learning jump higher after the pop. Keeping your center of mass low will allow for a more impressive jump, so the lower you can crouch will still keeping control of the board, the better.








Do not twist your hips or lean your shoulders forward. Keep your center of balance between your feet to keep control., Try rapidly raising your arms as you execute the jump to increase your upward momentum.







, If you can delay your sweep by just a fraction of a second, you can achieve a higher jump.








Determining the right amount of delay to really master this will take some trial and error.

, For the most impressive ollie, pull both of your knees up toward your chest as high as you can as you reach the high point of your jump, and level the board in this position. 







, Your forward momentum should keep rolling forward as you land.








Again, not falling off at this stage will take some practice, but once you've mastered the fundamentals, this is the icing on the cake.

",How to Indy on a Skateboard,";
, Immediately reach down for the middle of the toe side of your board with your rear hand. As you are making this grab, you will want to collapse your body as if you're doing a squat. This squat will bring the board closer to your hand.

Get air.,
Tuck your legs.,

Hit the bolts.,
Bend your knees.",How to Land Simple Skateboard Tricks," If you can't land, it might be because you haven't got enough air. Practice the Ollie until you have quite some air. Don't worry about landing it just yet, just focus on air. To get more air in an Ollie, start with your feet further down the skateboard. That way, you'll pop the tail harder and slide up further. Now try getting air with a kickflip.;
, If your legs are dangling around while the board is trying to spin, they could get in the way. To prevent this, tuck your legs in while the board is flipping. You don't need to pull them up all the way, just enough for the board to spin freely.

, You won't really need to in an Ollie, but in a trick where the board spins around, like a kickflip, you'll need to keep an eye on the board. Keep your legs tucked in until you see the trucks. This way, by the time you kick your legs out you'll land on the griptape.

, When you see the trucks and kick your legs, you should be aiming to hit the bolts on the other side. This is because the bolts are the strongest part of the board, making it less likely to break, and your weight is spread out, making the board less likely to fly out from underneath you. If it does, you could seriously hurt yourself.

, If you try to keep your legs straight, you won't have much balance and you could hurt (or even break) your legs. To prevent this, bend your knees to absorb the impact until you feel comfortable. Don't rush to stand up quickly, you won't look any cooler if you do. You could even fall and look really un-cool. As you get better and better at the trick, you won't need to bend your legs as much or for as long.

Never “hitch a ride” by grabbing onto the back of a car. Also called “skitching,” this activity is incredibly dangerous and can lead to fatalities.Use Google Maps to help you chart a good course in advance., If your city has bike lanes in the roads, use them. These lanes are generally well-maintained and provide a smoother surface for skateboarding. Furthermore, pedestrians and cars aren’t allowed in this lane, so you won’t have to worry about running into them. Keep in mind that some cities have laws against skateboarders using the bike lane. Call your local police department to find out whether or not you can do this.


Stay on the right side of the lane while skating. If you need to pass someone, pass on their left. Make sure to warn them as you approach by yelling, “On your left!”
Obey all traffic laws while using the bike lane., Skateboards are great modes of transportation. However, your chances of sustaining a serious injury are greatly increased when you don’t wear protective equipment on an uneven surface. Unlike a skate park, the surfaces you’ll be skating on will be irregular and can change unpredictably.


Protective equipment includes helmets, knee pads, elbow pads, and shin guards.
This equipment can be bought at most sports department stores and skate supply shops.

This is the best way to learn cross country skiing. Skiing off the trails, or ""back country"" skiing, requires significantly more effort, and is only recommended once you are comfortable on the trails, and have a heavy-duty pair of skis.If you are not at a prepared skiing area, pick a flat area of powdery snow with no obstacles.;
, Stand on flat ground with your skis parallel to each other. Bend forward at the ankles, and slightly at your knees. Keep your torso straight, not bending at the hips.This position helps keep you balanced, with your weight over your feet.

, Scoot one ski at a time slightly forward, getting a feel for the amount of force you can apply without losing your balance or bending above the hips.


It takes significant leg strength to turn this shuffling motion into the ""kick and glide"" motion described below. Many recreational skiers prefer to only use this shuffling technique of moving forward., Every skier falls, so learn the correct way to get up early on in your practice. Set the poles aside after a fall. Adjust your skis so they are parallel to each other, rolling onto your back if necessary to get them untangled. Place the skis onto the snow, to one side of your body, and crawl forward until your feet are behind you. Kneel on top of the skis, and use your poles to push yourself up.If you fall on a hillside, raise your skis in the air and bring them down on the slope below you to get in a more stable position. Crawl to a flat area before you stand up. Keep the skis to one side as you crawl, not directly beneath you, or your weight could push them down the hill.

, Leave your ski poles aside for the moment, so you can practice this new motion without relying on your arm strength. Push your right foot down into the snow to get moving, swinging your right arm forward and your left arm back. Immediately shift your weight over your left ski and raise your right ski slightly above the track, gliding forward with your right ski trailing behind you. Return your right foot beneath you, then push off with your left foot and glide on your right ski. Alternate between feet to continue moving. Try to find a rhythm where your legs alternate in even strides as your hips adjust your weight from side to side.


Push down into the snow with a slightly forward stride, not with a backward kick.Relax your body while you are gliding, keeping your weight slightly forward to keep your momentum.
This can be exhausting and difficult for a beginning skier. If you get tired, take a break or return to the shuffling motion for a while.

, Once the ""kick and glide"" movement forward feels a little more automatic, pick up the ski poles. Immediately after you kick forward with your right foot, and shift your weight to your left foot, plant your left pole angled backwards and push with it to give your glide extra momentum. Use your right pole to give yourself momentum after a left kick.Plant each pole close to your body, barely extending your arms forward., Practice the ""herringbone"" method of stepping up hills. Point your toes outward to make a ""V"" shape with the skis behind you, then roll your ankles slightly inward to push the edge of the skis into the snow for a firmer grip.Lift one ski completely off the ground and step forward. Maintain your balance with the ski pole on the same side as the ski with which you are stepping. Alternate with the ski and pole on the other side.

, As a beginner, only glide down gently sloped hills that contain tracks for your skis. Lean further forward over your skis when gliding downhill to avoid falling backward.If you are not comfortable gliding down a particular hill, point the toes of your skis inward in front of you, and angle them so the edge closest to you is digging into the snow.Step down in small steps, keeping your weight back above your feet.


If you need to stop suddenly halfway down a slope, crouch low to the ground and lean backward, letting your skis slide out from under you. Hold your poles out of the way behind you, where you won't run over them or fall on top of them.

Consider learning the classic style first.,
Ski on the right surface and equipment.,
Get in position.,
Set aside your ski poles.,
Point your skis outward and practice the correct foot motion.,
Practice skating forward.,
Try again with ski poles.,
Learn other skating techniques if you want to race or go faster.",How to Cross Country Ski2," The ""classic"" cross country skiing described above is how most people learn to cross country ski. Skate skiing is best for athletic skiers interested in faster movement or racing, or for people with experience ice skating or roller skating., Skate skiing involve powerful, angled motions of the skis to provide a faster boost. This is rarely possible away from groomed trails, with a firm snow surface. Specialized skate skis are also helpful for providing additional strength and control, although you may attempt to skate ski on ordinary cross-country skis.Note: While most skate skiers do use ski trails, you cannot skate ski inside the ski tracks cut into the trails. Skate on the surface of the trail itself, next to the ski tracks.

, Bend at the ankles and knees, but keep your upper body straight and relaxed. Bend your elbows and keep your hands in front of you., When you are first learning, it's a good idea to practice without ski poles, so you can focus on your leg motions. Ski poles will add extra power later, but should not replace strong leg movements.

, Keep the skis pointed outward in front of you in a V position. Turn your right foot onto your little toe, setting the outward edge of your skis against the snow. Rotate your ankle as you push gently against the snow, so the ski returns to a flat position ready to glide forward. Bring your right foot back into its original position, then practice this motion a few times with each foot.

, Still without the poles, practice this same motion, but push harder and glide on the opposite ski. Push with your right foot, then lift it as you shift all your weight onto your left ski to glide forward. Repeat the motion in reverse with your left foot, trying to keep your whole body directly above and in line with the ski moving forward.If you are having trouble keeping your balance, stop and practice balancing on one ski at a time without moving.

, Once you can repeat the gliding motion, practice the ""V-1"" skate skiing motion.To do this, plant both poles into the snow at the same time one of your feet lands on the snow. Your remaining foot hits the snow while your poles are up in the air.


The V-1 sequence of motions goes ""lift foot 1 foot (0.3 m) 1 + both poles land, push with all three, lift foot 2 foot (0.6 m) 2 lands.""
You may time the poles to coincide with your left foot or your right foot, whichever is most comfortable.

, The ""V-1"" position described above should already get you moving faster than the classic cross-country skiing style. However, as you become more experienced, and especially if you develop an interest in racing, there are several more techniques you may wish to learn. Possibly the most common of these is the ""V-2"" style, in which you plant both poles and push just before each foot lands on the snow.Experienced skate skiers most commonly use this on flat terrain to gain more speed, and resort to the ""V-1"" technique described above only when climbing hills.


The V-2 sequence of movements goes ""lift left foot, plant both poles, push, left foot lands, lift right foot, plant both poles, push, right foot lands.""

Equip beginner and intermediate skiers with detuned skis.,
Detune edges after each retuning.",How to Detune Ski Edges," Your work surface should be long and wide enough to hold your skis comfortably. You’ll be filing away part of the ski while detuning, which will create fine sawdust.

Lay out a drop cloth or some newspaper on your work surface to catch dust and simplify cleanup.;
, Contact points are at both ends and on both sides of each ski. The contact point is where the edge begins to round. For most skis, this will be the widest part.

The area you need to detune extends about 2 in (5 cm) above and below these contact points., Ski vises have protectors (usually made of rubber) to hold your skis in place without damaging their finish.These are not necessary for detuning, but they can make the process easier.If you don’t have ski vises, you’ll have to hold the ski as you file, smooth, and polish it. You’ll be able to work more efficiently if the ski is held in a vise.
When using a vise, you’ll have to unclamp the ski to reposition it so you can work on its opposite side.

, 45° is halfway between horizontal (flat) and vertical (up and down). Hold the finely grooved side of a metal file against the edge of the contact point at 45°. With firm pressure, drag over the edge in long, continuous motions down the entire contact point., When the tip of the edge is flattened to a 45° angle, it is detuned. You may need to blow on your ski as you file or wipe it with a dry rag to clear away sawdust., Hold a medium-grit diamond sharpening stone in your hand. With your free hand, use a spray bottle to squirt the stone several times with water. Use several long, smooth, overlapping strokes with the diamond stone to smooth the edge.

Rewet the diamond stone frequently, but try not to saturate the wood too much with water. Wet wood expands, which may negatively impact your smoothing efforts.A diamond sharpening stone can be purchased at many hardware stores, home centers, and sporting goods stores., This tool is sometimes spelled as “gummy,” “gummi,” or “gumy” stone. Go over the detuned contact points lightly with this stone. Use several strokes and long, smooth, overlapping motions.Gumi stones are relatively inexpensive and can be bought through online retailers or at sporting goods and winter sports stores., You may find it easiest to file all contact points before smoothing with a diamond sharpening stone and polishing with a Gumi stone. Alternatively, you could file, smooth, and polish points one at a time.Wipe down skis with a dry rag to remove sawdust in between filing, smoothing, and polishing.

, Rails and boxes are usually found in the Terrain Park of the slopes. You can do tricks like jumps and grinds off these features. Tuned skies tend to stick on rails and boxes; detuned skis will work best., The sharp edges of tuned skis cut more deeply into turns, making it harder to release the turn. This can cause difficulty to beginner and intermediate skiers, who may not yet have the experience to compensate for this like a veteran might., After a season or two, it might be time to get your skis tuned again. After retuning, you’ll have to detune contact points again. This process can be a little annoying, but when contact points are detuned and the rest of the ski well-tuned, your skis will handle the best."

Start by finding a large, gently pitched slope, preferably with not too many people.,
Practice making slow, parallel turns with your skis.

,
Position your skis a little more than shoulder's width apart.,
Apply pressure to the forward-inside edge of the ski that will be the 'outside' ski for the turn (i.e., right ski, if turning to left).,
Keep your forward and into-the-hill hip angle and stick with it throughout the turn.,
Straighten your turning leg and step onto inside edge of the other ski at the same moment as you plant your pole for the next turn (""plant up"", meaning plant pole as you straighten up and shift your weight).,
Build a slight up-down rhythm that is also slightly rotary (forward-up at the beginning, or top, of the turn, on your big toe, and sinking to have weight slightly farther back onto your inside arch-heel as you come through the turn, to keep the edge from skidding, then up-forward again as you make your next pole plant.

,
At first, you can allow almost all your weight to be riding on the inside edge of your outside (or turning) ski.",How to Carve Like a Downhill Racer on Skis,";
,, You don't want them so close that they could get tangled up with each other in mid-turn, but you want them far enough apart for stability. The right width is important in making banked turns without your knees colliding.

, Focus on putting you weight on the ball of your foot just behind your big toe and on your inside arch, at the same time as you press your shin forward gently on the cuff of the boot. As you start to turn, push your inside ski slightly forward (and lift that inside knee slightly, which will commit your weight to the inside of the turn) and let your hips fall in and forward toward the inside of the turn. Keep forward pressure on that forward inside edge of the outside ski until the turn comes all the way around. Make sure that no matter how sharp your turn is that your upper body remains parallel to the hill. (Not tipping your shoulders)

, Commit to the turn! Do not exit the turn too early (which would be when you are accelerating straight downhill -- trust that your forward and inward pressure will bring that ski around). Remember: finish the turn skiing perpendicular to (across) the slope before going on to the next turn.

, Then repeat, going the other direction into the next turn.

,, With shape skis, as you get more proficient, you can learn to keep more weight on your inside ski, carving that ski in the same fashion as the outside ski (except on the inside ski you have to weight the 'outside' of the ball of your foot inside the boot).

Therefore, you will need to find out which organization governs certification where you would like to teach.Most of the organizations responsible for governance of snow sports training are members of the International Ski Instructors Association (ISIA), the worldwide association for ski instructors, which determines minimum standards for ski instructor certification.Before signing up for a ski course, make sure the governing body of the country where your course will take place is a member of ISIA in order to be certain you will obtain a valid qualification.
It would be wise to obtain your certification in the country where you would like to teach; however, some countries will allow you to teach with certifications from other countries.;
, There are several types of skiing, including adaptive alpine skiing, alpine skiing, cross country skiing, and telemark skiing. You can also specialize in children’s skiing or freestyle skiing.Make sure that you find a course that will allow you to learn how to instruct the specific type you are interested in.

, Although the names and levels of certification may vary by country, generally speaking, they are more or less similar. You may decide later on to continue to higher levels of certification, but it is good to have an ultimate goal in mind as this may change your career opportunities.


For example, in the USA, the levels of certification include: “Registered”, “Level I”, “Level II”, and “Level III”, As a registered member, you are not certified to teach. Instead, you will be learning more about what it means to be an instructor as well as the fundamentals of skiing. At this point, there is no examination, and you do not need to do any special training (although you should be practicing and improving your own skills). You simply have to register with the body that governs skiing instruction in your country; in this case, the PSIA-AASI.


During this time, you should attend training seminars in your area to understand what your country expects from a certified ski instructor. Understand that is your responsibility to initiate training during this time., As a level I certified ski instructor, you will be allowed to teach beginning and novice skiers. In order to earn a level 1 certification you must be able to demonstrate a basic knowledge of the sport and know how to interpret the snow as it pertains to teaching. They can typically only teach on groomed runs.During this time, you should spend time reading and studying to understand different techniques used in skiing, as well as how to teach them. You can also spend time instructing others in order to put into use what you are studying.You can also attend seminars, discuss what you’re learning with other instructors, and watching videos about skiing.

, To get to level two, you are required to demonstrate your ability to teach clientele proper ski technique and how to choose appropriate ski technique. For this certification, you must pass a three day exam. Level II instructors are also able to teach nearly all clientele in many different conditionsFor this level, you will also likely need to attend an on-slope training and assessment course that will last at least two days. Depending on your country, you may also have on-line or in-person learning modules that you will need to complete., This is the highest certification level. In order to become a level III instructor, you must be an expert skier and must also pass a four day process of certification. Only 10-20% of candidates are able to successfully complete this certification., There are a myriad of choices when it comes to schools for ski instructors. These schools are located all over the world, but it is probably best to choose a school in the country where you would like to teach. Begin by searching online using the terms: “ski instructor school” plus the country where you want to learn. If you know other ski instructors you can ask them if they have any recommendations for good schools as well.

, Training courses can be very time consuming and expensive. Before committing to a school, take the time to find out the details of your school.


The best way to do this is to call the school or arrange an appointment to find out what kinds of certification they offer, whether the certification will be recognized by the governing body of the country, and if they will help you find a job.
You can also ask if they provide equipment for their courses, if they provide accommodations, how much time you will spend on the slopes, etc.
You should also look for reviews of the school online. If you know any former students of the school, ask them to tell you about their experience.

, Although this is not required, it is probably a good idea to take a lesson (from a Level III instructor if at all possible), especially if you have not skied in awhile. Even if you are an expert skier, it certainly won’t hurt to have a refresher lesson, especially since you may have forgotten some of the more fundamental aspects of skiing.


Taking a class will also give you a better idea of the job of a ski instructor and the opportunity to observe different styles of ski instruction. You will need to adjust your training style depending upon the capabilities and personalities of your customers.

, Although you do not need to be an expert to be a ski instructor, you need to be a high intermediate skier. Many people take ski lessons to advance their skills beyond those of a beginning skier. Learn and perfect a couple of complex moves that you can teach your customers. This will also help in attracting and keeping your clientele.

, If the school is not local for you, make sure you have arranged transportation to the course as well as a place to stay during the course.


Ensure that you have submitted all of the proper paperwork and paid all of the required fees.
If the school does not provide equipment, make sure you have arranged equipment rental or that you will be able to bring your own equipment with you on your train, plane, or bus (if you are using public transport).

, It is best to do this during the summer months, as ski resorts want to be fully staffed by the first snowfall. There is usually not a predetermined opening date for ski resorts, as the weather cannot be accurately predicted that far in advance. Keep in mind when applying for jobs that the best paying positions will be given to applicants with the highest level of certification. As your teaching experience and certification level improves so will your pay.


If you have a hard time finding work, consider an internship. Though these may not pay well (or at all), they offer a good way to get some experience, which can pave the way to a job.

, Trends are constantly changing so your ski style will need to also. Take as many training classes as you can to learn new styles and teaching methods. This will keep you competitive with other ski instructors and improve your reputation, which will also increase your clientele.

You can also stand the skis on their end and pick ones that are about 13cm (5 inches) shorter than you. Shorter skis are easily to learn on than long skis.The longer the skis are that you choose are, the more finesse it will take to slow down and turn because you have more ski to move.;
, When you first put your boots on, your toes may feel crunched, but this is normal and it will go away. Once the boots are strapped up, you should be able to barely wiggle your toes but your whole foot should be secure.Ski boots should be tight but not to such a point that your feet are uncomfortable. There is a fine line between the perfect fit and boots that are too small.
Ski boot sizes are not directly related to sneaker sizes. You should ask an employee at the ski park to assist you with choosing the right boots.

, Ski poles are used to help you balance and turn. Choose a set of poles that come roughly to your ribs or chest. The poles should be around 1 ½ ft (45 cm) shorter than you. Find poles that have grips you are comfortable with.

, Wear layers but avoid clothes that are too bulky. You are still exercising, so you will probably sweat. The exact amount or type of clothes is personal preference.Wear a tight t-shirt that is breathable as your base layer. Wear a fleece or sweatshirt that will keep you warm. Your top layer should be a waterproof jacket, if possible, but not a bulky one that restricts movement.
For pants, you might wear sweatpants with waterproof snow pants over the top. Also, wear warm socks that are comfortable on your feet.

, Skiing can make you cold for two reasons. The temperature on ski slopes tends to be low anyway given the fact that there is snow on the ground. You are also racing through the air at high speeds which makes you colder. Choose a hat and gloves that fit snug on your head and hands.


Wear waterproof gloves if you can because you might fall and get snow on them.
Wear a hat that pulls down completely over your ears.

, Wear goggles to protect your eyes from wind burn. A whole day of wind blowing in your eyes can cause harm to them. Despite the cold, there is also a strong chance that you’ll get sunburn from the glare off of the snow. Wear sunscreen to protect your face. Helmets are also a good idea to protect your head in case you fall.

, The basic stance for skiing, especially for a beginner, is to keep your legs in line with your hips. As you get the feel on the slopes, you can move your feet farther apart or closer together. Keep your skis mostly parallel but with your toes pointed slightly inward., Skiing uses the same basic athletic stance as most other sports. It is important to bend your knees because it improves your balance and it helps you take on the impact of bumps in the slope.


Your ski boots will restrict how much you can bend your knees anyway, but you only need to bend them slightly.

, Move the weight onto the balls of your feet. Stay off your heels and resist leaning back. You will be leaning forward since your body is angled down the slope, but don’t lean too far forward. Keeping your balance centered on your feet will keep you going straight.


Leaning left or right will make you turn and leaning too far forward or backward will throw your balance off.

, There are a number of ways to turn, but one of the simplest is to lift one ski just off of the snow. This will turn your body in that direction. So if you want to turn to the left, slightly lift your left ski. If you want to turn right, slightly lift your right ski.


You can also turn by twisting your hips in the direction you want to go. Twisting your hips will turn your skis in the direction you want to go.

, The simplest stopping technique is the wedge or snowplow method. Turn the front points of your skis so they are closer together. To stop completely, get the front of your skis as close as you can without touching them.Point your toes toward each other gradually. If you point your toes together with a quick movement you are likely to throw off your balance.
Practice stopping from slow speeds until you get the hang of it.
How early you slow down depends on how long the hill is and how fast you are going. For small hills, you should slow down in the last 20 yards or so. On larger hills at higher speeds, look to slow down in the last 20% of the hill.

, Doing online research is great, but nothing beats having a live person give you specific instruction and feedback as you get started. Sign up for lessons before you get to the ski park or ask about beginner classes when you arrive.You may have the option of group classes with other beginners or private lessons, which may cost more.

, Ski parks post signs that tell you the difficulty level of each slope so that you can stick to ones that are good for your skill level. Look for signs at the ski park you are at to see what system they use.Common slope ratings go from green (easy) to black (hard) or from a circle (easy) to a diamond (hard).
If you can’t find a sign with slope ratings, don’t be afraid to ask an attendant what the rating system is or what some good slopes are for beginners.

, You will not be an expert on your first run, so don’t try to tackle the biggest slopes in record speed when you start skiing. Use the wedge or snowplow technique to keep yourself moving at a slow speed until you master slowing, turning, and stopping.


Stop halfway down the hill if you feel like you are picking up too much speed. You can start again and finish the hill.

, Coming to a complete stop is one of the harder things to get used to when you begin skiing. To keep yourself and others safe, practice stopping long before you get to the very bottom of the hill.

Adjust the front of the binding.,
Position a ski boot in the ski binding so that the toe of the boot is fitted into the front of the binding.,
Calculate your DIN.,
Adjust your toe piece to match your DIN settings.,
Adjust the back of the binding.,
Test the fit.",How to Adjust Ski Bindings1," Before calibrating the bindings to match the DIN setting (release force setting), you’ll need to adjust the length and pressure of the bindings to match the boot size.


Not every binding is the same, even within the Alpine class. The front of the bindings will have a millimeter counter on the front which you will need to match with the number of the boot’s sole length. The length of the sole is usually printed in millimeters somewhere on the heel of your boot. Some newer bindings have a locking feature that allows you to release and adjust the binding without having to use a screwdriver.
When adjusting bindings you should always consult a professional technician and a DIN chart at your local ski shop. ;
, When you lock the boot into the binding, you’ll need to check the midsole and the forward pressure system.


Check to make sure the middle of the boot matches the middle of the ski.
Then, locate the pressure indicator on the back binding. The indicator, found on the heel piece, needs to be in the middle of the adjustment zone. Move the heel binding a few millimeters until you’re in the correct position. , The DIN number (so-called because the standard was established by the Deutsches Institut für Normung) determines how much force is necessary to release the boot from the binding. For most adult skiers who are beginners or intermediate, the DIN setting will be between 2-7. Adult intermediate to expert level skiers will be between 3-12.


The DIN number depends on several factors including the skier’s weight, height, age, boot length, and skier ability. Use a DIN calculator to figure out the DIN.
You should not attempt to adjust your DIN setting or make major adjustments to your bindings without the help of a certified technician. Improper adjustments can lead to a serious injury, like a torn ACL or worse. Adjusting your DIN setting can also void your warranty. Calculating your DIN setting is hard to do without a chart. So it’s best to refer to an online calculator and a ski professional. The DIN setting will factor your age, weight, ability, height, and boot sole length to give you an approximate number.

, With a screwdriver, rotate the screw located at the front of the ski binding until the number next to it matches your DIN number.


The toe piece of your bindings will have an area that displays several numbers, usually on the top. Turning the screw will move the indicator allowing you to match it with the correct DIN number.
The DIN number is an indication of your release force setting. This setting determines the strength of the release trigger when you fall. Having the proper setting is extremely important, which is why you shouldn’t attempt to do this unless you are a professional. If your boot releases too early or too late you will seriously injure yourself.

, Make sure you’ve slid the back end of the ski binding up so that it is snug against the heel of the ski boot. The pressure indicator should be in the proper position.


Turn the screw located on the rear ski binding until the skier’s DIN number aligns with the indicator.

, Grab a ski pole and put on your ski boots. Position the boots in the bindings toe-first, using your heel to lock the binding in place.


Make sure your brakes are in proper position. When the binding is open, the rear brake will be parallel to the ski; it will snap to a 45-degree angle when it’s closed. Use the ski pole to push down on the brake to unlock the binding. You should feel some resistance when trying to release your bindings. You can then use the foot you just released to step down on the other binding to release.
Adjust the fit if necessary. If you're having difficulty opening the binding with a ski pole, you might want to try a lower DIN. Be careful, though; set the DIN too low, and you’ll pop out of your bindings and injure yourself on the slopes. Set it too high and your boot won’t release at all.
See a professional. Even if you think you’ve got your bindings adjusted correctly, check your work with a professional. Certified technicians will be able to help you achieve an ideal fit.

Adjust the fit.",How to Adjust Ski Bindings2," For cross country skis, there are a few types of bindings that you may be working with. Because not every binding works with every type of cross country boot, you will have a certain type depending on the boots you have.


The main types of bindings are:

New Nordic Norm (NNN), or the Nordic Integrated System (NIS). These bindings feature two thin raised ridges that fit to matching grooves in your boots. The boot will have a metal rod at the toe which clips into the front of the binding and acts like a door hinge.
Salomon Nordic System (SNS) Profil bindings. These bindings use a single, wide binding ridge and a single matching sole groove.
SNS Pilot bindings. These bindings are similar to the Profile bindings. Except these bindings use two metal rods to click into two different binding slots. These bindings are thought to offer superior kick motion and flex while providing excellent stability.



, If you have NIS or NNS bindings, you can adjust the bindings with your NIS key. Insert the key into your binding and press down. This also works on skate skis with an NIS plate.


The key allows you to slide the binding up or down along the ski. There are slots under the binding which your binding will click into. Every time you place your binding correctly into a slot, you will hear a click.
On classic skis, moving the binding toward the tip of the skis will give you a better grip. Moving it back gives you better glide.
On skate skis, moving the binding toward the tip of the skis toward the tail gives you a lower gear which translates to a faster start up with your stride. Moving toward the tip gives you a higher gear and a higher maximum speed.
As of January 1, 2016, Salomon bindings will carry the NNN system. Meaning that you won’t have to screw holes and mount the bindings into the correct position. You will be able to adjust new skate bindings with an NIS key.

, With a screwdriver, rotate the screw located at the front of the ski binding until the number next to it matches your DIN number. Position a ski boot in the ski binding so that the toe of the boot is fitted into the front of the binding.


Make sure you have the right type of bindings for Nordic skiing. Cross-country touring bindings are lightweight and more narrow, intended for use on groomed tracks or relatively flat expanses of snow.
Metal-edge touring bindings are heavier and wider. These bindings are meant to be used in more rugged terrain.

, You can also adjust your back plate to match your bindings to your boot’s length.


Insert the key into your back plate and move it forward or backward to match the distance you moved your front plate.

, Nordic ski bindings attach only at the front of the foot, leaving the heel free and detached from the ski.


If you’ve adjusted the bindings correctly you should be able to move easily and feel like you have adequate control over the skis. Put on your ski boots and test your bindings.
You should be able to release your boots from the bindings by pressing down on a release near the toe with a ski pole or with your hands.

, If your boot doesn’t feel secure in your bindings you will have to adjust the bindings with your key again.


Move the back plate forward or backward to adjust for your boot’s size.
Repeat the process on the second ski. Barring rare exceptions, your DIN and binding fit on the second ski should be the same as the first.
Adjusting your skis should be done by a professional technician at your local ski shop. These professionals can make sure you have the correct gear setup. A professional will make sure that your skis are adjusted for your body and ability level.

Determine your preferred type of skiing.,
Pick the right types of skis for you.,
Consult a professional.",How to Adjust Ski Bindings3," The type of skis you get will differ on how and where you ski. If you like to ski larger hills and mountains that offer steeper runs, you will want Alpine skis, or possibly Telemark skis. Alpine skis are made for steeper runs where you will be riding up to the top of a hill or mountain and then skiing down to the base.

, There are four main types of downhill skis, and three main types of cross country skis. You have all mountain skis, twin tip skis, backcountry, and racing skis.


The equipment you need for these different types of skis will not be the same across the board. All mountain skis with a wider waist are the best for all around skiing.
Twin tips have two tips which bend up, like a snowboard. These skis fall into two relative categories, all mountain, and park.
Backcountry skis are the widest and are meant for powder and ungroomed trails. These skis help you float on the snow but don’t let you turn as sharply.
Cross country and Randonée skis don’t accommodate for steep slopes. These skis feature lighter gear that aids in skating and climbing. These skis don’t allow for very sharp turns.
Telemark skis are a sort of mix ski that offers the ability to remove your back heel like in a Nordic ski. But a telemark ski is still designed for skiing down steeper and more aggressive slopes.

, The best way to get the proper setup is to go to your local ski shop and get outfitted and measured by a ski professional.


Professional technicians can properly adjust your bindings and pair you with the right boots and equipment. You should consult a professional every season as your weight and ability may have changed.

Get the right gear.,
Find your deep snow.,
Respect the deep snow.,
Expect skiing on deep snow to feel very different from other snow experiences.,
Learn to form a platform and to use the technique of platform unweighted.,
Build up speed.,
Rely on the other ski basics you've learned on the groomed slopes.",How to Ski in Deep Snow," Dealing with deep snow will be easier if you've got the right skis, and the type of skis will depend on where you're headed. For deep snow in back country areas, use wide overland touring skis, although narrow versions can be good if you tend to ski both deep snow and set ski tracks.In recent years, as well as the extra-wide skis for deep powder, all-mountain super-sidecut or shaped skis make deep snow skiing a lot easier than earlier types of skis, due to the extra-wide tips and tails.The greater the surface area, the better the skis on deep snow.


Be aware that extra-fat skis are not much good for anything other than deep powder and they're not useful when you're on a crowded ski field. If you don't want to go to the expense of buying such skis for the rare deep powder chances on uncrowded mountainsides, consider renting them for the day. If you want to buy skis that work for both the deep powder and the usual slope, go for the the super-sidecut shaped skis.
Talk to the retailer in depth about your needs. They may be able to make specific suggestions that are tailored to your needs.;
, Powder, or deep snow, isn't found at all resorts, and obviously some resorts get more deep snow than others. It is advisable to learn which resorts have the best consistently deep snow in your region (or wherever you're able to get to) and to do this, you can keep an eye on the websites of each resort as well as weather reports. Tony Crocker's site ""Your Guide to Snowfall"" is another good place to keep an eye on. Do note a tendency of some resorts to over-report the snowfall levels, although with Twitter, Facebook, and iPhone apps now reporting snow levels, this exaggeration tendency is tapering off.Learn as much as you can about the route and the resort before setting out. If there are paper maps, study them and take one with you.
Heed back country restrictions. Some places are closed off to protect nature, others are to protect you. Not heeding this puts not only your own life in danger, but potentially the lives of buddies accompanying you and rescuers. Even if you do get through safely, if you're caught, you risk fines and loss of passes for the season, etc.
Be aware that not all snow is created equal. Although deep, snow can be unpleasant when powder is impacted by rain, wind, spring thaw, other skiers recently having skied over it, etc. Technically it's no longer powder but it can take the novice a while to spot the hazards and changes. Learn how to spot snow changes, and how to adapt your ski method to the different types of snow, in order to avoid breaking your legs or having other accidents.

, Deep snow comes with its own dangers and it's important to be aware of safety issues before heading out onto it. Things to keep in mind include:


Never ski alone. No matter how tempting, don't. Always have a ski buddy; things happen and if you're alone, there will be nobody to notice you're missing in time. And if your buddy is inexperienced and doesn't know the slope, take along a guide who does. Mountain conditions can change dramatically and rapidly.
Know how to spot avalanche risks and how to avoid them. Read Stay Safe in Avalanche Country for more instructions.
Be aware of the hazards of deep snow. Falling into deep snow can result in suffocation. One way this can occur is when a skier falls into a ""tree well"". Tree wells are hollow spaces created around trees; they form because the lower branches prevent snow from packing close to the tree and instead create pockets of loose air or snow when there is a build-up of snow. They're common in forested areas where deep snow falls, such as Colorado. On falling in a tree well (usually head first), the loose snow begins to quickly pack in around you and you can't always be seen by other skiers. Long-time ski instructor Craig McNeil advises never to ski close to evergreens on gladed runs in order to avoid tree wells. Read How to escape a tree well when skiing for more instructions.
Don't assume that following a previous skier's tracks will keep you safe. They may have been a stronger skier than you, or worse, they may be lost!

, Deep snow doesn't behave like other snow. It is deep, it isn't firm under your skis, and you need to get used to the feeling of ""floating"" on what feels like a cushion of powder. Getting used to skiing on deep snow takes time, and you'll get better at it with experience. For starters, deep powder requires very good balance to prevent you from having one foot sink deeper into the snow and the other foot ending up in the air. The aim is to get both skis behaving as one, to enable you to ""float"" over the deep snow rather than to sink into it.


Take opportunities to practice on deep snow in less intimidating places at first. For example, cut into the powder alongside a shallow piste or groomed run and let yourself feel the bouncier effect as you glide down. Use this opportunity to test your balance and find the differences between deep snow and groomed snow balance requirements (such as not leaning too far back).

, Aim to keep even weight on both skis as much as possible. This enables both skis to act as one, providing a ""platform"" for your body as you glide over the snow.Keep your skis parallel and balanced evenly.
Do not lean back. This is a common mistake made by many skiers; doing so will cause you to lose your balance and you will fall over, and you won't be able to turn or slow down.
Distribute pressure much more evenly than you would normally do on skis for any other skiing surface. If you place all your weight on your outside ski, you'll sink.
Keep your skis a little closer together than you'd normally have them.
Lift your outside hand and push your feet forwards as you unweight. Doing this will make it smoother and access more powder.
On groomed snow, you're used to using the edges; avoid this on deep snow. Instead, push against the soles of your feet completely. And, at the end of a turn, push down through your heels.

, With practice, you should start to feel more comfortable and to feel as if you're bouncing out of the snow at each turn. Speed is your friend in deep snow; allow yourself to get a little speed and push down on your skis with slight steering to control the speed. First left, and then right, or alternatively right, and then left. Repeat.


Think about turning as a means of controlling speed. Anticipate the next turn as you finish the last. Flex down and apply the pressure needed to create the platform under your skis.
Plant the pole and extend to up-unweight.
Steer your skis into the fall line. As you make each turn, continue to steer your skis.
Each finished turn will regulate your speed.

, The rest of what you know about skiing applies to deep snow skiing too, such as bending your knees, keeping your upper body stable, and keeping your hands out in front. Stay balanced front and back, and at all times, maintain an even pressure on both skis.


Repeat. Once you've started and experienced the thrill of deep powder, it'll keep calling you back. While basic instructions can get you enthused, nothing can compare with getting out there and actually trying it. Just be sure to keep skiing with others to ensure safety, and to observe weather, snow, and other relevant conditions to minimize all hazards.

Start generating a little speed.,
Crouch slightly and spring up while turning your body.,
Look up and over your shoulder throughout the turn.,
Continue skiing down the slope.",How to Do a 360 on Skis1," You should be skiing at a bit of a slope to help get you moving.









Start in flatter and easier slopes. This will give you enough speed so that you can turn without stopping, which can make you lose your balance.;
, Use your head, arms, and shoulders to rotate. While turning, make sure that the skis are completely flat, so that the entire surface area of the ski is touching the snow. This will not only stabilize your balance, but it will also lessen the chances of you falling.









Your arms and shoulder create a lot of the spin, so really focus on using them to help you spin.
Your skis should be parallel to each other throughout your turn. Keep your legs shoulder-width apart.

, Keep looking over your shoulder until you've returned to your starting point.








Avoid looking down at the ground. This can throw off your balance and contribute to a fall., Your skis should stay on the ground through the entire rotation. Continue practicing as you ski down.









Gradually add pops, or tiny jumps, during your grounded 360s. This will be good practice for eventually doing an aerial 360.

Ski away.",How to Do a 360 on Skis2," The park jump, or ski ramp, shouldn't be enormous when you're starting to learn 360s. Try to find one that few people are using, since you'll need to be aware of other skiers when jumping.








, Your legs should be a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Balance your weight on your toes and keep your skis parallel. Lean forward with your whole body.








, You should squat and twist your arms down to the side and back in the opposite direction you intend to spin.








The windup is important since it creates a spring action. This is what allows your body to twist in mid-air., Wait to pop up a bit and turn your skis once you're in the air. Then twist your upper body in the direction you want to spin the 360.









The harder you twist, the faster you'll spin.

, At first, turn your head over your shoulder looking in the direction you are spinning. Keep your head fixed while you spin and as you release, look at where you'll land.








, Once you come around, pull your arms out and away from your body to slow down your spin.








, Shift your weight forward and avoid tensing your muscles into a locked position. Remember to relax so you can absorb the landing with your hips, knees, and ankles.Try leaning forward and bending your knees slightly to soften the landing.

, If you are intending to stop, stop at the side where you are out of the way of others. If you are intending to spin another 360, repeat these steps.

On gentle terrain you can turn by lifting the skis and rotating them.,
At the top of your ascent, remove your skis.",How to Alpine Tour," Alpine touring involves a lot of climbing, often at high altitudes. Before beginning alpine touring, you should be at least a strong intermediate skier (comfortable on black diamond slopes) and in very good physical fitness.;
,, Most skin systems have a loop which goes over the tip of the ski, and a latching mechanism to lock onto the tail. The skin should be taut. The sticky ""glue"" side of the skin should press firmly against the ski, with the ""hairy"" side touching the snow.

, Your heel should move freely while your toe remains firmly attached to the ski.

, The ski should not lift off the ground. At the end of the stride snap your leg straight, putting your heel down and putting your weight on the forward ski.

, On steep terrain, you need to execute a kick turn. Rotate your uphill ski as far as you can, so that you are facing up the mountain with a ski pointing each direction. Put your weight on the uphill ski, then rotate the downhill ski to match it.


, Remove the skins, folding them in half so that the glue surface only touches other glue surfaces. Put your skis back on, using downhill mode, and enjoy the descent!

,,,,, This is the foot that will drive you out of them (the one closest to the line).

,, It's personal choice.

, Put your heel on the line. Put your other heel against your toe. You should be two foot lengths out now. Place the block so the part of your spikes that have pins are resting flat on the tartan surface of the block. If you sit into your blocks at this stage, your knee of your front leg should just touch the line.


Weak foot block: do the same, only instead of two feet out you are going 3 feet (0.9 m) out from the line.







, Your toes should not touch the ground- they should be well up the blocks. Make contact with the complete block with your foot for maximum power transfer.


At the ""on your marks"", you should be in a kneeling position, with your hands shoulder width apart, on the tips of your fingers just behind the line.







, This will help your arms leave the blocks as fast as possible. Twist your arms outwards so your palms and elbows are facing outwards. Then twist only your hands back so your palm is now facing inwards. Your elbows should still be facing outwards.

,, When you hear it, raise your backside as far as you comfortably can, while still remaining ""coiled"", while inhaling sharply. Hold your breath in anticipation, and when you hear the gun, forcibly exhale as you explode off the blocks. You should be aiming for long, powerful strides rather than quick, short ones.

, This will ensure a long, powerful first stride.

Improve your core musculature.,
Javelin throwers can train their core to support their backs, to speed up their hips dramatically and even to give them more speed during their run-up but most importantly, javelin throwers can avoid weakest link syndrome by strengthening their core allowing them to make use of all of their body's power for massive throws!

,
Proper core training stabilizes your entire back during a javelin throw.,
Increase your hip power.,
Improve your approach.,
Take an objective look at your core.Make sure your core isn’t your weakest link to avoid weakest link syndrome.,
For example, say you can bench press 200 lbs while lying on a bench but you can only press 105 lbs when you’re standing in a lunge position pressing forward and not braced against a solid object (such as the bench).",How to Train Your Core for Javelin," Today, core training for javelin throwing can improve how far a javelin thrower throws like in a big way no matter what their age! Javelin is heavily dependent on the core musculature for optimal performance and having a proper core program in place can guarantee just that for any and all javelin throwers.;
,, It can help the athlete attain a bigger, longer more powerful position under much more load. It strengthens the stomach muscles and surrounding musculature so that it can hang on no matter how hard the javelin thrower drives their hips forward allowing a bigger stretch to be created without jeopardizing the lower back via the abs giving way under pressure. Engaging in a core program also helps the athlete move their hips and lower body faster.

, Hip power and speed play a big part in big javelin throws. Having fast, powerful hips can create a ton of power and allow the body to uncoil much more rapidly during a javelin throw. Core training plays a pivotal role in speeding up the hips of a javelin thrower. Almost any athletic motion must first be initiated by your core and the stronger you core is, the quicker this initial motion can and will be. So if you want fast hips, let alone a fast arm and fast feet, start your javelin core training program right away.

, When you start your core training program for javelin, you’ll notice that it will speed up your javelin run-up as well. A strong core helps you avoid losing energy each time you take a step during your run-up. This allows all of your energy to be transferred into your run-up and eventually into your javelin throw. A well trained core will also help you take bigger, more powerful strides during your run-up and allow you to go faster on the runway with better control.

, If anything, make sure it’s your strongest link because it’s your foundation and your foundation should always be very, very strong-especially if you’re a javelin thrower. If your core is weak, it doesn’t matter how strong your arms or legs are because they depend on your core musculature for support.

, In the case of the standing forward press, it doesn’t matter if your upper body is strong enough to press 200 lbs because your core can only support 105 lbs. Thus, you just gave away a total of 95 lbs of pressing power because your core is only strong enough to support the 105 lbs of load.


You want to be able to have a strong enough foundation or core to use all of the power you’ve got in both your upper and lower body. Start training your core regularly and you’ll be able to put all 200 lbs of power into the javelin for colossal javelin throws!

"
Start with strength training.,
Increase total fitness during the base season, aka early summer.,
Increase the intensity during the late summer period to include high-end aerobic work and start race specific work.,
Increase training in the fall.,
Continue in the winter.,
Pick up the pace in spring.,
Taper.,
Relax post-season.",How to Train for the 800 Meter Race in Track and Field," Focus on 3 sets of 8-10 and hit each leg group. The goal is to work the muscles in ways that will maximize their ability to generate power over extended periods as well as to work stabilizer muscles that are under-trained in most runners. 3 sets of 8-10 works the body past pure power lifting (creating phosphate energy), but remains within the range for maximum strength benefits. Lifting helps extend the potential to increase power, which increases potential stride length, and thus the potential to run faster, especially if lean muscle mass and not bulk is added. Replace every 4th lifting day with plyometrics to ensure maximal conversion of strength training to explosiveness and fast running.


Emphasis needs to be placed on abductor/adductor exercises to help prevent injuries from overpronation and knee tracking issues (i.e. imbalances causing the knee to not glide on the patellar joint and instead irritate the cartilage), including but not limited to IT band syndrome, shin splints, tendinitis, etc.
Example Schedule: Day 1=Squats, Abductor, Adductor, Calve raises. Day 2= Lunges, Leg Extension, Leg Curl. Make sure to include core, including back extensions and abdominal crunches as well as some chest and shoulder exercises to assist with form.
Other lifts that should be included focus on the lower back and hip flexors, muscles that are often ignored. Deadlifts, Split-Squats, Glute-Ham Raise, Straight Leg Extensions, and barbell step-ups onto a knee high platform are great ways to develop strength in these muscles.
Lifting sessions should be less than one hour. To do this, utilize circuit type training approaches (i.e. while taking rest from squats, do pull-ups).
Recovery should include a protein/carbohydrate snack within one hour to maximize anabolism (protein assists in the ingestion of carbohydrate. A balanced diet should contain enough protein, so protein shakes are unnecessary - the body can produce a majority of amino acids). A nice glass of chocolate milk is ideal.
A non-lifting way to achieve the same objectives is to incorporate soccer or Frisbee or basketball once a week to help work on stabilizer muscles, explosiveness, and reinforce turnover. Football players rarely have an issue with over striding or slow turnover for a reason.;
, The anaerobic system can reach 95% of its potential training for 6 weeks. Therefore, the only training that should be done in the summer should focus on aerobic conditioning and strength training. This can either be a cross country training program, or can be something consisting of the following:


One long run per week to build up oxidative enzymes (up to 15 miles (24 km), but no more than 1/4 of weekly mileage), 2 days of hill sprints including form drills (lead-yard bounding is recommended, see images and search for Lydiard foundation), 2 days of lifting, and just plenty of mileage until you are up to at least 30 miles (48 km) per week.
Mileage is very important to most 800 runners. While elite sprint types can normally get away with 30-40 mpw, most elite 800 runners need to build base at 50 mpw up to 70-80 to maximize fitness and to consolidate aerobic gains.
Note: Unless you have hit a mileage before, do not increase more than 10% or 3 miles (4.8 km) in a given week. For example, For someone running 60 mpw, mileage by week coming off of a break would be 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 35, 45, 50, 53, 55, 50, 55, 58, 60. Note that as the mileage increases to near maximum, the increase in mileage per week slows and lower mileage weeks are built in for recovery. Most 800 runners have a need to taper mileage every third week by ~20-30% (i.e. w1=60, w2=60, w3=45, w4=60...) in order to prevent physical and mental burnout. Build this into your schedule!

, After the mileage is built up, start including strides at the 800 meter date pace. For example, 12 x 100 @ 800 with 300 jog. This is to reinforce speed principles and build muscle memory/efficiency without straining and/or compromising aerobic conditioning. Also include 5K workouts (i.e. x mins @ 5K pace, x minutes recovery, where x starts at 2 and works up to 3-5 minutes for a maximum of 20-25 minutes). A great way to ensure that you are not overworking your athletes, but to keep hammering the different physiological systems is to do three week mini-cycles (i.e. in a 3 week span, you do 1 tempo runs, 1 day of cruise intervals, 2 days of 5K intervals, 1 day of 3K intervals, and 1 day of 200 meter hills, so 33% of the workouts are lactate threshold, 33% are VO2, and 33% are efficiency (At vVO2 or 1500/800 effort).


This can also be done at threshold pace for those focusing on XC (workout would be x mins @ slightly slower than 10K pace with 1 min recovery, starting at 2 minutes and working up to 6-10 minutes). Threshold pace is the pace at which a steady state of lactic acid is accumulated in the blood (~ 4 mM). Additional effort will cause a significant increase in lactic acid accumulation and will not improve your body's ability to buffer lactic acid and to clear it. Thus, it is an effort and not a pace.
Sample week: Sunday: 15 miles (24 km), Monday: 6 miles (9.7 km) + 6 x Hills, Tuesday: 4 x 6 min @ T with one min jog, LIFT. Wednesday: OFF Thursday: 10 miles (16 km) + Hill Sprints. Friday: 6 miles (9.7 km) + 12 x 100 @ 800, LIFT, Saturday: 8 miles (13 km) easy.

, Start including intervals @ 5K pace. Intervals can start @ 400's and work up to intervals that take between 3-5 minutes (for example, 6 x 1K @ 5K with equal time recovery). Distance running increases mitochondria, increases the number of capillaries, and increases stroke volume, decreasing heart rate (aka, the infrastructure). VO2 max training on the other hand increases the ability of the body to take oxygen, absorb it into the blood stream, and subsequently deliver it to muscles (think the cars using the infrastructure) while threshold training helps to eliminate byproducts of training (think maintenance crews). Thus, they are all important and all have their place. VO2 max workouts should replace the Friday workout, which can replace hill sprints one of the days or can move to Saturday. At this point, the runner should be in great aerobic fitness and strong, but not ""fast"". Downhill sprints or sprints that are wind assisted should be incorporated to reinforce turnover.

, Now it is time to concentrate on race specificity. Workouts should now be 3 days a week and can often work on a 14 day cycle (i.e. every 14 days includes 1 VO2 max workout (aka 5K pace), 1 threshold workout, 1 workout at vVO2 (aka 3K pace), 1 workout @ 1500 pace, and 2 workouts @ 800/400 pace). For example, work from 8 x 300 @ 1500 date pace to 5 x 600 @ 1500 date pace. Interval length should for the most part be no longer than half of the race and the total distance at this pace should be no more distance than 2.5 times race distance (at that point, if you can run that, it's not your race pace, or you are recovering too long!). You can also run race simulations (600 @ 800 or 400 @ 800, 1 min, 200 @ 800).


Make SURE to keep up the work focusing on turnover, otherwise the 400 will suffer. Running the 4x4 at every indoor meet is a good way to turn a race into a full speed workout.
Take days easy/off as necessary for races, but train through (i.e. don't take 3 days off to recover for a dual meet).
Lifting should cut back to one day per week to account for the increased intensity of workouts, but can be replaced by plyometrics (depth jumps, alternate leg step-up jumps on an appropriate bench, alternate leg bounds, straight legged jumps (calve workout), etc.).

, Now is the time to blast the anaerobic system. My favorite workout is 8-12 x 200 @ 800 meter date pace (pace you could run that day) with a 200 meter jog. This workout will give your body superior ability to buffer lactic acid, be relatively stress free mentally, and is just a good third workout. Running 4 x 400 at 800 meter date pace is a fantastic way to teach your body to run fast through fatigue. Practice running these date-pace type workouts with intervals both at ""first lap pace"" (i.e. goal pace - 2 seconds) and ""second lap pace"" (I.e goal pace + 2 seconds).


Lifting should be minimized and focus should be on form building plyometrics.
Focus should be on longer intervals (i.e. 400's at 800 meter date pace) and should work towards goal pace (i.e. 5-6 x 300 at 800 meter goal pace with ample recovery).
Increased focus on training at 400 pace should also be included, as the 800 time is in part limited by speed endurance, i.e. how fast one can run the 400 (400 time x 2 + 12 seconds = rough ceiling).

, A taper should be a slight cut down on quantity, a slight increase in quality, and a few extra days easy before race. We are natural hunters and gatherers. Therefore, cutting back mileage excessively will cause your body to go into hibernation mode. A workout such as 200, 300, 300, 200 for goal pace race simulation is a great easy workout, followed by 6 x 150 @ 400 to reinforce speed and turnover. Again, do not cut your mileage by more than 20%, but thresholds and VO2 work should be minimized (i.e., no more than 10 minutes a week of efforts at these paces to reinforce maintenance of physiological adaptations).

, Take two weeks off to recuperate for the coming year. Lifting is encouraged, but other than that, have fun!

First ask yourself:


Evaluate your fitness level, where do you lie on the endurance scale?,
Plan out when and which race you want to complete in.

,
Plan your training phases accordingly in the weeks leading up to your race.

,
Record your training sessions


List weekly mileage totals, how you felt and any unusual or key things during the training session for future reference right after your workout

Do not skip days.,
Start out in 4 week cycles.,
Split up your days into morning and afternoon and/or night unless it’s a brick workout and you are to follow one after the other.

,Always follow a quality harder workout with an easy training session for two-day sessions

,
Be aware of your technique in cycling, swimming, and running.,
Put in as many miles you can biking, swimming, and running.,
Focus on bike endurance distance training.,
Adjust your training more to the sport you are weakest in.

,
Take one day off each week throughout your training.,
You can recover faster from harder bike and swim workouts


Do not to put a quality bike and run on the same day unless it’s a brick workout

,
Don’t increase your easy week mileage if you are tired.,Complete 2 long runs and 2 long bike rides per month and alter these each week

,
Place a couple of bike tempos in your distance rides, it will increase your stamina.

,
Bike the distance of your race, and the last 40-60 minutes at a slightly faster pace, and then run 20 to 30 minutes at your planned race paces.,
Do intervals; a 2-5 minute burst at a hard pace with 2-4 minute recovery and completing anywhere from 3 to 15 of these intervals, depending on the work load and duration and your fitness level.

,
Recover between intervals for 2 minutes.,
Train with a couple high speed workouts


Helps you focus on faster paces and make you pay attention to your technique.

,
Hill workouts are awesome and prepare you for the course


A good bike hill takes 2 -3 minutes and 4-12 repetitions.,
Put in quality running instead of quantity.,Complete one hard track session per week

,
Start in Phase I building a base, lasting 2-16 weeks depending on your race schedule and pace of conditioning.

,Swim 3 times a week, every other day first focusing on technique in the beginning of the week, then easy distance swim, then long swim

,
Continue into Phase II, the Maintenance stage with interval speed work, lasting 8-12 weeks in training volume.,Advance into Phase III Race tailoring and pacing, lasting 8-12 weeks

,
Taper at least 2 weeks before your race.,
Calculate the speeds and split rates that you are capable and want to compete at before your big race.

,Take a day off 2 days before the race

,Swim 300-500 yd/m 10-20 min, bike 20-30 min, and run 10-15 min at race pace the day before your race

,
Plan out your gear that you are going to wear for your race and it should be pre-tested to prevent any discrepancies.

,
Make a point to enjoy the race.,
Give yourself adequate time to recover after your race and take care of your body.

,,, It is important to keep track of your mileage and progress and to adapt your training as such.



,


The first 3 weeks is mileage and intensity building by 5-10% each week depending on your training level and experience.
The last week of the cycle is an easy recovery week where intensity and mileage volume is backed down to the beginning intensity and duration of the 4 week cycle.

,,,


Perfecting these shaves off major time in your race. Better technique means being quicker, with less energy. With longer distances in a race, technique makes a big impact.
Proper bike fitting, stroke technique and running economy and fitted equipment can help you.

,


Spend 20-25 hours per week training. Professionals spend 30-40 hours per week

,


You recover faster from biking and swimming more than running. This gives you a greater endurance boost with quicker recovery.
Cycling endurance can be transferred to running endurance.
The bike leg is the major portion of the race

,,


This allows for recovery and rebuilding enhancing your endurance.

,,


If it’s during the 3 week building cycle keep your mileage at the same level or consider an easier recovery week if your body is not able to continue and start over the 4 week building cycle.

,,,


This is a very hard workout(a.k.a brick workout)

,,


This makes it harder on the body and full recovery doesn’t happen before each interval.
In more than 3 minutes your ATP stores are completely refueled.

,,
Running hills are 200 m to 400m with 4 -12 repetitions.

,


For instance, you should insert a quicker, up-paced tempo in the last 20-30 minutes of a long run and get the added benefit of both workouts.

,,,, This training phase is adapted to the type of race you are competing in.

,, Optimally 3 weeks. Downplay your mileage but maintain your endurance fitness level and train at race pace.


You will not gain anything from any excess workouts outside of your tapering leading up to your event. It will only hinder your race.
Tapering will help your race and increase your energy and allow your muscles to fully recover and be fresh before your race. This increases your chance for a successful race.
Reduce your long run or bike by half

,,,,, Quitting the race can happen if it's not enjoyable to you.

,, Each person is unique in what motivates them and what makes them succeed. This how to is basic in nature that can be applied to all training programs and modified by you for your specific needs and goals. Happy training!

Face the side of the ring.,
Step back with your less dominant foot.,
Lower your body by bending your hips and knees.,
Place the shot at the base of your fingers in your dominant hand.,
Hold the shot at your neck, right by the jaw line.,
Explode up into a standing position.,
Use your entire body weight to throw the shot.,
Push the shot away from your neck in one fluid motion.,
Stretch your arms and relax your muscles.,
Begin your exercise with a warm-up.,
Cool down after throwing the shot put.",How to Throw a Shot Put," Rather than directly facing your target, you should make a quarter turn so that you face the side of the ring. Beginning at a 90 degree angle from the target allows you to twist your hips in order to gain momentum when throwing the shot., If you are right-handed, you will step back with your left foot. This gives you stability and added momentum for throwing the shot., This will also help you to gain momentum as you throw. Twist toward the back of the ring and keep your non-throwing arm low., You don’t want to hold the shot in your palm, but rather at the base of your fingers, with your fingers slightly spread apart. This allows you to flick the ball off your hand.Bend your hand back in a cocked position. Imagine that you are balancing a tray or pizza box. Your hand should be steady, but not over-extended, as this may cause an injury., Make sure that your elbow is bent and parallel to the floor. Your thumb should point down toward your collarbone, and you should point your palm in the direction that you are throwing.Keep your eyes and head back, rather than focused on the shot., You should twist your body to the same side as your throwing hand as you rise, so that you are facing the target when you release the shot., Extend your arm to its full length while pivoting your hips to face forward., Try to release the shot at a 45 degree angle. Make sure that you wait to release the shot put until your arm is fully extended. You may flick your wrist to add more momentum, but be careful not to overdo it., You want to make sure your muscles are limber before and after throwing a shot put. To stretch your shoulders, stand near a doorway and lift your arm, holding it straight and parallel to the floor. Grab onto the frame of the door and gently lean forward, which will extend your arm behind your shoulder. Hold the position for 30 seconds, then repeat the exercise on the other side.

, This will prevent you from straining your muscles and ensure that you are working out at full capacity. Loosen your muscles with a general warm-up, then do specific exercises to target particular areas.


A general warm-up can consist of running, swimming, or riding a bike.
For specific exercises to target your arms, you can try push-ups or lift weights.

, You should stretch your muscles after throwing the shot put to cool down. You could make wide circles with your arms to stretch out your muscles. It is important to cool down so your muscles don’t tighten up after exercise. This will help you avoid injury and lactic acid build-up.

Try walking around the track while swinging your arms to loosen your muscles.

Choose a team and make sure you're interested and committed to track.,
Make sure you have the time.,
Get running shoes.,
Get a watch.,
Make a training calendar.,
Train as a beginner.,
Train for medium to advanced.",How to Train for the Junior High Track Season," Most middle schools have a track team, but you can look into teams at YMCA's and local community centers if yours does not.


Talk to previous athletes on the team and make sure that they've had generally positive experiences.;
, Track is a big commitment during the season, and most also do individual training during the off season. On average, expect to have 5 days a week practice for about 1.5 to 2 hours. It's also best to have the time to train on your own for at least a month before (see Training).


Track is hard work. Know that practices will be difficult, and competitions nerve wrecking. Be willing to push yourself.

, A good pair of running shoes is essential. If you've actively used your running shoes for more than 3 months, replace them. Many shoe stores have assistants who can help you choose a proper pair. At the junior high level, most schools don't allow spikes but check to make sure. Invest in a good pair––they may be a bit pricey but it's worth it in the end.

, A watch is crucial to training and the competitive season. You will often do timed interval workouts or go on long runs that need to be precisely timed. Most Walmart and Target stores sell them for roughly $20. They don't need to be really fancy-just make sure they have a stopwatch and timer.

, Create a schedule that you can stick to for pre-season training. Tack this up somewhere where you'll be reminded to train. In order to create this schedule look to the following steps.

, If you're a beginner at running start out with 30-minute intervals of walking and running. Work hard, and slowly increase the amount of running time to a non-stop 30 minutes. Once you've achieved this incorporate increasing intensity workouts and tougher terrain.


To start, try 4 to 5 minutes run/jog, 1 to 2 minutes walk for 25 to 30 minutes.
For beginning workouts, try run fast for 1 minute regular pace for 3 minutes for 30 minutes. Then gradually increase the running fast time.
Start by running 2 days a week.

, If you've previously participated in XC or Track or already run Congrats!, you have a bit of a head start.


Alternate long runs 40 to 60 minutes and workout days.
Finish long runs with hill sprints or accelerators.
Run 6 days a week.

Release the shot.",How to Shot Put," The word ""shot"" refers to a heavy ball, which contestants try to hurl as far as they can. Beginners should start with a light shot, between 4 and 8 pounds (1.8–3.6 kilograms), since this lowers the risk of injury if the wrong throwing form is used.


Once you have the basic throwing technique down, and some practice under your belt, you can move on to heavier shot puts. Standard weights for competition vary depending on the age and sex of the competitors, and the nation hosting the competition.;
, When shot putting, you must stay within the circle during the entire throw. The circle is usually painted on a slab of concrete, and is 7 feet (2.13 meters) wide for official competitions. If you step outside the circle during the throw, it is a foul and is not counted in the competition.


After throwing, the athlete must exit the circle through the back half of the ring, not the front, or the throw becomes a foul. (This avoids arguments over whether an athlete stepped over the line during the throw or afterward.)
The circle usually has a ""toe board"" in front that will block the athlete's foot from going too far forward. You are not allowed to step on top of the toe board.

, After the shot lands, the distance from the front of the circle and the location of the landing is measured. However, the shot must land within the cone-shaped throwing field, or else it is a foul. The athlete whose shot lands farthest from the circle, without committing a foul, wins the round.


If you need to make your own cone-shaped throwing field, set it up using two equal lengths of string at least 50 feet long each (the sides of the cone), then a third length (the end of the cone) exactly 60% as long. Measure the long sides from the center of the circle., Because the shot is so much heavier than balls in other sports, it cannot be tossed overhand or underhand without high risk of causing a pulled muscle or other injury. Always ""push"" the shot put out by extending your arm in one direction, without swinging it. Read the instructions below for more information about standard throwing techniques.

, Cup the ""shot,"" or heavy ball, with your fingers and thumb along the back side of the ball. Don't touch the shot with your palm, and don't spread out your fingers around the ball. Use your dominant hand.

, Place your right foot on the back of the circle, and face the right side of the circle. Stand with your feet a little more than shoulder's width apart. While you'll move on to a more powerful throwing position later, this is a good stance to get your started while you concentrate on the arm and leg motions involved.


This guide is written for right-handed shot putters. Switch ""right"" and ""left"" if you are left-handed.

, Stick the shot underneath your jawbone next to your neck. Keep your right elbow raised so the arm can push directly into your neck.

, Point your left arm upward in the direction you'll be throwing. During the rotation leading up to the throw, pull this arm inward so your hand is against the center of your chest.

, Surprisingly, most of the strength in shot putting comes from the legs, not the arms. Put almost all of your weight on your right leg, at the back of the circle, bending your knee as much as you find comfortable while keeping your balance.

, Push forward as hard as you can with your back leg, turning your hips so you face forward as you do so. Step or jump forward as you do this, sticking your front (left) foot as close to the front of the circle as you can.


If you are having trouble keeping your balance and aim while you do this, start out in the center of the circle instead and take shorter steps while you practice.

, As you straighten out, move the shot out from under your jaw and send your arm out in a straight line at about a 40º angle upward, toward the field. Always keep your elbow raised and your wrist straight. If your elbow drops or your wrist bends downward during the release, this will result in a ""tossing"" motion that risks injury and fails to make full use of your momentum.


The optimal angle is between 37º and 38º., Keep practicing this throw, especially the final delivery of the shot put. Once you can perform a good throw consistently, start pushing off more vigorously during the throw, so your left foot lands as close to the front of the circle as possible. Once you can keep your balance and aim while leaping and turning hard, move on to the glide throw, one of the techniques used by serious competitors.

, This section of the guide will assume you already know the basic grip of the shot, the general motion, and how to release the shot for maximum distance. This ""glide throw"" is very similar to the basic throw described above, but provides extra power if you are able to keep your balance.

, As with the basic throw, stand with your feet a little more than shoulder width apart, facing the right side of the circle. Press the shot into your neck with your dominant hand, with the elbow on that arm raised to shoulder height.

, Turn your body and feet without changing your stance, so you are facing the back of the circle. Bend your right knee so all your weight is over your right leg, at the back of the circle. Your left leg is extended behind you toward the center of the circle. Your left arm is pointing down and forward, over the back of the circle.

, Kick hard off your right foot, and lift both feet in the air, turning to face the right side of the circle. Bring them down again so your left foot is touching the toe board at the front of the circle. Keep your weight mostly on your back foot. Your left arm swings around and ends up pointing upward toward the side or front of the circle.


Transition to the next step as fast as you can, so you can take advantage of your forward momentum.

, Immediately after landing, push off your right foot again, transferring your weight forward onto your left foot. Extend your back leg fully, and push the shot forward at about a 40º angle at the moment when your arm is facing forward. Ideally, your arm should extend over the front of the circle.

, Your push should be strong enough to keep you spinning after the shot is released. Hop on your left foot one or two times to complete the spin, without falling outside the circle.

, The spin throw involves two complete rotations before the shot is released, which can easily cause you to lose your balance. Being familiar with basic throwing technique is vital, so you can avoid injuring yourself by flinging the shot with an arm in the wrong position.


Both the spin throw and the glide throw are used by professional shot putters, with mixed opinions over which is more effective.

, Grip the shot with your fingers and thumb, and press it against your neck.

, Both shoulders and feet should point to the back of the circle, with your feet shoulder width apart. Both knees are slightly bent, and your weight is evenly distributed.

, Slowly pivot onto your right foot. Turn your hips and shoulder so you are facing to your right (the left side of the circle). Remember to keep the elbow on your putting arm raised at all times. Pause and prepare to start the spinning motion: the rest of the steps below will all happen within a couple seconds.


Switch ""left"" and ""right"" if you are left handed.

, Rapidly pivot on your left foot, bringing your right foot swinging around over the back of the circle.

, As your right foot swings back into the circle and around, push off your left foot and land with your right foot in the center of the circle. Your knee should be bent and your whole body angled down.You have now rotated 360º – one complete spin.

, Push off your right foot in the center of the circle, and continue the spin an additional 180º (half rotation). Land with your left foot as close to the toe board as possible, and your right foot back toward the center of the circle.


Keep your head and right arm in the same position during this spin, to avoid interfering with your shoulder movements., Use the usual technique to release the shot, as soon as you complete your spin. If you extend your arm straight forward and upward with your elbow raised, the rotational momentum from the spin will be translated into the shot.

For jumps, do things to increase form.,
For long jump, work on your standing jump into the pit.,
For triple jump, work on cycling your leg through for the first step, also bounding with or without jump ropes is really helpful when it comes to your second step.

,
For both of these you will want to practice your approach many times.

,
For high jump, try working on your back arches, and do a standing jump over the bar.,
For the throws and shot put, discus, and hammer throw, you want to work on upper body strength.,
Be very careful doing these events, using the proper form as not to injure your shoulders or elbows.

,
When running distance, work on your endurance, as well as breathing patterns, those can really help!

,
For sprints, work on block exits.

,
Also, say you're running the 200m dash, train by running 250 or 300 meters (820.2 or 984.3 ft) so when you run the 200 you won't burn out in the end.

,
With any running, work on form.,
For hurdles, work on form by having 5 or so hurdles right in a row and walk over them using proper form.,
Also, if you're running the longer hurdles, 300⁄400 meter (2.5 ft) hurdles, you will want to train distance once a week so you get the endurance.

",How to Train for Track and Field Events,";
, Also you could have someone hold a rake where you normally jump, forcing you to jump farther.

,,, Then increase it to a four step approach and go from there.

, Hit the weight room!

,,,,, Knees up and never behind your butt. Arms, hips to lips.

, Then do 3 exits into the first hurdle, 3 into the second hurdle and so on.

Run.",How to Run a 3200M Track Relay," Before running the race first you must understand the rules.


The 3200M relay has one of the biggest groups of runners in a track meet.
Just like a 400 meter relay runners start in the same place, the starting triangles are usually blue, yellow or white. After the first runner completes the first lap the official puts the next set of runners in order by place, such as first or second.;
, Decide the order in which you and your teammates will be running. The best way to decide on this is:


1st runner (1st Leg) -2nd fastest runner
2nd runner-(2nd Leg) -4th fastest runner
3rd runner (3rd Leg) -3rd fastest runner
4th runner (Anchor) -1st fastest

, The 4x800 relay is usually the first race in a traditional track meet. With that being said, it is important that you and your teammates begin to get your bodies ready for the race, you can do this by.


Running 1-2 laps around the track
Stretching arms and legs
Practicing baton hand offs between team members
Hydrate (water, Gatorade, etc.)

, Before the race begins the officials will call for all 4x800 teams.


If you or any of the other runners on your team miss the first call don’t worry, the official will call for teams 2-3 times before the race begins.
After all of the teams are gathered the official will assign each team a lane number, usually lanes 1-8.
The number you are given will determine the lane number in which the 1st leg runner will start in.

, This step is simply for the first leg of the relay race.


It is important to understand that when you are the first leg of the relay team you have to run your first lap in the lane you were assigned.
After the first lap the officials will let you know that, it’s ok to cut into the first lane after passing the first curve going into your second lap.

, When receiving a handoff for the 4x800 relay it is important to use an open handoff stance.


This is when you or a teammate stands parallel to the track lines of their lane to receive the baton.
This is important because it helps you gauge the distance between you and your teammate, you are also able to control which hand you hold the baton in.

, Sound simple enough, right? Actually, it’s not as simple as you would think. Like in any other race there is a technique for running an 800M.


It is important to focus on yourself, the 800M is an endurance race.
When running try to keep your own pace, trying to keep up with everyone else will throw you off your game.

Start eating healthy.,
Run up to three miles everyday, (more if you are training for cross-country events).,
Before running, warm up.,
Gather data.,
Practice your hurdling if you want to be a hurdler.,
Keep in mind: if you are going to do long jump or triple jump, practice your bouncy sprint everyday.,
Remember, for high jump, you can't practice without the track equipment.,
Improve your distance.,
Keep a daily sports journal and log-in all training sessions.,
Participate in running events outside of school.,
Congratulate yourself, because soon you'll be ready for track!

",How to Prepare for Track," If you don't know how you should eat, then go to a physician and ask them, ask a personal trainer, or go to choosemyplate.gov and get your pyramid plan. (All Events);
, Make sure you stretch well before your training and after your runs in order to avoid chances of injury. In other words, pay attention to the warm-ups and the cool-downs. They are equally important!


Please note this advise is primarily geared for those of the ages most likely to be in a track meet, such as those still in High School or College. Therefore if you are a senior or handicapped and have joined some form of track and field team, and luckily there are more and more of these type sports teams going around, you will need to scale back some of the distances and goals suggested in this ""how-to."" To support all ages, especially the young, the elderly and those with disabilities, it is highly suggested to first get a work-up and see your physician. This is mandatory in order to make the most gains and keep your goals aligned with your capabilities.The point is if you are handicapped or are over the age of 40 you will need to scale back much of this advice and go slower. Ultimately, yes the daily 3-miles is a lofty goal, certainly attainable by those with the pre-requisites of prior health. This is primarily for the ""20 something"" age crowd. For all others, please take it piecemeal.
Start with the proper pre-run exercises and on day 1 do not attempt over an eighth of a mile or 1 full lap on a standard track field. Do this for several days and then raise this up to the quarter mile mark for several more days. By the way, ""never"" run 7 straight days in a row, always have days of rest in between, so the muscles recuperate. By the end of the month you then may be able to do the full mile. From there, you may wish to add an extra mile every two to four weeks. In this way, within 3 short months you could be running 3 miles (4.8 km) per day.

, You can do this by doing a warm-up lap and running drills. Stretching is also good before your run. If running three miles is too hard for you then gradually increase your mileage every week. For Example: Week one, run 1 mile (1.6 km) everyday. Week two, run 1.5 miles (2.4 km) everyday. Week three, run 2 miles (3.2 km) everyday. Week four, run 2.5 miles (4.0 km) every day, and week five, run three miles everyday. It could actually be better to gradually increase mileage than just running three miles every day for all five weeks, because you are gradually increasing stamina and muscular ability. (All Events)

, This is much easier if you live near a track. On some days, sprint one hundred meters and mark your time. Then, sprint two hundred meters and mark your time. Then run four hundred meters and record your time. Sometimes during the five weeks, you may see your times get either better or worse. If they get worse, work harder, or check to see if you're injured. If they get better, you are doing well.

, (Hurdling: 100 hurdles, 200 hurdles, and 300 hurdles.> hurdles.)

, Use a proper jump pit (Long Jump and Triple Jump)

, Throwers also need the correct equipment. Just wait for track season and stay very fit and healthy. Lift weights to build strength too. (high jump, shot-put, discus, javelin)

, If your forte is ""distance"" than work up to running either 800 meters (two track laps on a 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) track)or one mile/1600 meters (four laps on a 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) track. (Distance: 800 meter, 1600 meter/ mile.) On the other hand, if your best event is short distance running or ""relays"" than practice short speed runs with a team member with a digital stop-watch. Even the tenths of a second count in a real track meet.

, Log-in your work-outs and exercise routines. This is the best way to know if you are excelling and at what pace. It will help you set realistic goals. Use this journal to plan your meals and sleep schedule if you are really looking to take this to the extreme. Only you know the degree or the actual reasons you are partaking in the track field. Always strive for a balance between excellence and yet not being a perfectionist to the point of drudgery. Make this great fun...create fond memories for you, your family and your team-mates. Sports camaraderie will be something you will look back on someday with great pride!

, For many of you, the goal is running a marathon or partaking in a triathlon. It has become ever so popular to have marathons in support of badly needed charity funds. People will get sponsored for the amount of miles they run and these monies are then forwarded to the charity sponsoring the marathon. A very noble goal!

The life vest must be properly fitted so that it does not slip up on the body when falling.


It should fit snugly but not be uncomfortable.
Be sure to check the manufacturer’s label for weight limits and sizing information. ;
, You will want a pair of combination skis, which are suitable for beginners and have two skis with one ski having a half-foot binding behind the other foot. Skis for beginners will usually be wider and thus more stable on the water. They will be made for different weight ranges so it is important to pick a water ski that suits your size.


Check the manufacturer recommendations for the recommended weight ranges for the particular skis you are looking at.
Kids skis are different in that they are smaller and easier for small children to control. They will usually come with a “trainer” option, or when you tie the skies together to prevent the skier from losing their balance and performing the splits.
The bindings will usually be adjustable for a range of sizes to fit a variety of people., Trainer skis for kids can often be tied together, preventing the child from doing the “splits”. Kids usually have a hard time keeping control over their skis and keeping them together so this can be incredibly helpful when beginning.

, A water skiing rope will have a little stretch only and be 75 feet (22.86 meters) long from the handle to the opposite end. Do not use a wakeboarding rope, which will have no stretch, or a rope that is too stretchy.


The rope should be labelled and marketed specifically for water skiing.

, There are seven different hand signals that a skier should learn. These are important for signalling the boat driver while water skiing.


A thumbs-up means go faster while a thumbs-down means slow down. It is important to remember this while skiing so that you do not accidentally ask for more speed.
Bring thumb and forefinger together to signal OK. This tells the driver that the speed and path are good.
Point your finger in the air and move it in a circular motion and then point to the direction when you want to turn a certain way. This can be used by the water skier to signal that they want to go a particular way or by the boat driver to warn the skier of a turn.
Pat your head to signal that you would like to return to the dock. You can do this if you are tired and want to finish.
A slashing motion at the neck means to stop the boat immediately. This can be done by the skier, driver or observer in case of emergencies.
Clasp your hands over your head after a fall to signal that you are OK. This should be done after every fall., Many states require boats to have ski flags. These are usually bright coloured flags that signal to other boats that there is a skier in the water. Every time the skier is in the water and not skiing, the flag must be held up for other boats to see.


This is an important safety measure and most boats will need an observer who is in charge of watching the skier and holding the flag., The proper stance for starting to water ski is called the “cannonball” position.


While on dry land, put the skis on your feet.
Hold the handle and bend your knees so that you are sitting on the skis in the same form you would use to complete a cannonball.
Have someone pull gently on the other end of the rope to help pull you up into into a chair position. You will look like you are sitting in a chair, even though there is not one.
Make sure your knees stay together at all times and that you keep your arms straight to allow the rope to pull you up., The most important aspect of pulling a water skier is to start quickly, or have a lot of torque. This means that you must have a relatively strong boat and that you start from zero very quickly. This will help the water skier to get up on their skis smoothly.

, It is very important that the driver pull steadily to ensure a smooth ride for the water skier. If they change speeds or turn suddenly it can be very difficult for a beginning water skier to maintain balance.

, Usually early morning works best when water skiing because that is when the water is at its calmest. Later in the day there may be more traffic and thus rougher waters.


If you do hit rough water or wakes, then you should hit them at a 90 degree angle to minimize the bumps for the water skier.
It is important to make water skiing fun for kids so try to pick a time which is suitable for everyone when teaching them.

, Speeds will vary according to the size and experience level of the skier but there are general guidelines for water skiing. Kids should be pulled as slow as possible while keeping them out of the water. The speeds described here are for water skiing on two skis only.


Water skiers who are less than 50 lbs. (<23 kg) should be pulled at about 13 mph (21 km/h).
Water skiers who are 50-100 lbs. (23-45 kg) should be pulled at about 16 mph (26 km/h).
Water skiers who are 100-150 lbs. (45-68 kg) should be pulled at about 18 mph (29 km/h).
Water skiers who are 150-180 lbs. (68-82 kg) should be pulled at about 21 mph (34 km/h).
Water skiers who are more than 180 lbs. (>82 kg) should be pulled at about 24 mph (38 km/h).
Adjust your speed on turns. If the skier is on the inside of a turn then they will slow down and you may need to speed up. If they are on the outside of the turn they may speed up and you may need to slow down., You can easily slingshot a water skier on a turn so it is important to make sure that you keep far enough away from any docks or obstacles. Additionally, if a skier lets go they can travel quite far before sinking into the water so keep this in mind.


Do not go over any shallow water or where there may be obstructions just above or below the surface of the water.
Most ski accidents occur from collisions with docks or other solid objects so be very careful about staying in open water., You should usually have an observer on the boat to help you watch the skier in case they fall or are signalling the boat. It will be difficult for the driver to watch where they are going and keep an eye on the skier at the same time.


The observer will be the one controlling the ski flag and relaying signals to the driver.

, It is always good practice and safer to turn off the propeller completely when near anyone in the water. As soon as you get close, turn off the propeller and let your momentum bring the boat alongside them.


Be very careful not to injure the skier when bringing the boat near. Do not come too close and always turn off the propeller.

, An EZ ski trainer helps kids get used to being pulled behind a boat before trying to get them up on water skis. This device is like an inflatable jet ski that will be pulled behind a boat on a rope. It also helps kids build confidence, learn how to hold the hand and maintain balance.


The kids can sit or stand as they feel comfortable, learning how to balance and getting accustomed to being pulled behind a boat.
Be patient with kids and allow them to go at their own pace. This trainer can help reduce some of their nervousness before water skiing., Sit on the side of the boat or at the dock and put the water skis on. They should be adjusted for your correct size and you will usually simply have to slip your feet inside to secure them. The foot should be tight so it may take a little wiggling to get your feet in all the way.


It can help to wet the skis before putting them on, because it makes them easier to slide on your feet.
Kids may need assistance with getting their skis on properly so help them when necessary.

, Hold the rope with your two hands next to each other. Both palms should be facing down for water skiing on two skis. Make sure your grip is secure and your arms stick straight out in front of you., Allow your personal flotation device or lifejacket to keep you on top of the water and lean back. Bring your knees to your chest, with your arms around the outsides of your knees as if you are hugging them.


Bring the rope in between the tips of your skis with the handle between your body and the ski tips.

, While leaning back with your knees to your chest, bring your ski tips up out of the water, keeping your skis straight and close together. Water skis should be no more than hip width apart.


Kids skis will often have a rope or other device holding them together. This helps keep their skis together to maintain control.

, With the rope between your skis and your hands holding the handle securely between your body and the ski tips, keep your arms straight in front of you. This is a very important aspect of getting up on water skis.


It is very important to let the boat pull you out of the water and up onto your skis.
If you try to bend your arms or pull yourself up out of the water, you will likely lose your balance and fall.

, If you are close to shore, someone can hold the water skier in their arms, keeping their skis together and helping them to balance while leaning back with their knees to their chest.


This can be especially helpful for children, who may lose their balance or form while waiting for the boat to go.

, There cannot be any slack in the rope with the boat starts going or else it will jerk the water skier forward and cause them to lose their balance. Once the rope is in the water skier’s hands the boat can move forward at a slow pace until the rope is tight.


The water skier may move slightly forward through the water while the rope is being tightened. Be careful to stay balanced and maintain your form.

, Yell “hit it!” to the driver to signal that you are ready to begin. The boat will start quickly forward. Keep your form together and stay calm and confidence. Being confident and relaxed is very important for getting up easily on water skis.


It is more important that the boat has a lot of torque, or picks up speed quickly, rather than that it achieves a high speed., Keep your ‘cannonball’ form while leaning back slightly with your arms straight in front of you as you allow the boat to pull you up. The skis should be directly underneath you even though you are leaning back slightly. Do not stand up immediately.


Bending your arms to pull yourself up will only cause you to lose your balance so keep them straight.
Keep your eyes directly ahead. Putting your eyes and head up to avoid splash can make you lose your balance while looking down will likely cause you to fall down.

, Having your knees bent is imperative both before the boat starts and while you are trying to get up on skis. This will help you to maintain balance properly and better control your skis.


Even if the water is quite smooth, there will always be small bumps so keeping your knees bent will help to absorb those bumps.

, If you are comfortable being pulled and are balanced, try standing up. While standing keep your feet and skis directly beneath you and simply straighten out your legs while continuing to lean back slightly with your arms directly in front of you.


It might be best for kids to try skiing once or twice while remaining in the ‘cannonball’ form the entire time. This helps them to get used to water skiing and maintaining balance and control.

, It can be tricky to keep your balance while learning how to water ski. Be patient with yourself and keep your confidence. If you are getting frustrated you can give yourself a break and try again later.


Covering your face with your hands when you float back up to the surface can help prevent you from getting banged in the face by the ski if it falls off.
Hold up your arm or a water ski while the boat and turning to come back to you so that other boaters can see you and avoid you.

, Bending your knees will help you to absorb any bumps or wakes that the boat traverses, helping you maintain balance and continue standing.

, Do not try to pull yourself forward or maintain balance by pulling on the rope. You should simply allow the rope to continue pulling you forward.

, Lean back slightly with your hips forming a straight line with your shoulders. You can push your hips slightly forward and up towards the handle but make sure the skis stay directly beneath you.


Allowing the skis to move to far out in front of you will cause you to fall backwards.
Leaning forward will cause the skis to move behind you and make you fall forward. , Many skiers tend to hold their breaths while skiing but it is important to breathe naturally. Normal breathing will reduce fatigue and prevent you from getting overly tired.

, Try turning slightly by putting more pressure on the inside edge of the ski on the opposite side of where you want to go. Stay inside the wake for now.


For example, you will push down on the inside edge of the ski with your left leg and lean slightly to the right and away from the boat to move to the right. At the same time you can lift up slightly with your right foot to help you turn.
Make sure you keep proper positioning with your knees bent and arms straight in front of you while you turn., Make a turn to either side and cross the wakes by turning your skis at a sharp angle to the wake. Keep pressure on your ski closest to the boat until you are completely outside the wake.


Keep your knees bent to absorb the shock.
If you try to cross with one ski at a time, you will fall. Make sure you cross at a sharp angle to the wake with both skis at the same time.
Going over the wake should be quite quick. If you try to go slowly, you will fall.
Keep your arms straight in front of you while crossing the wake. Pulling on the handle is a common mistake made by beginners and can also cause you to lose your balance and fall."

Keep your workouts light as you get closer to the meet. You shouldn’t test your limits right before the meet. You can decrease either the intensity, frequency, or duration of your workouts.;
, In the weeks leading up to a meet, you should practice your events regularly. Practice whichever event you will be competing in, such as javelin, shot put, discus, hurdles, or relays.

, This will help you feel calm and ready when it is time for the meet. Check out the jumping pole if you participate in pole vault, or get familiar with the shot needed for shot put. Practice hand-offs for relays, or get to know the hurdles. If you are a sprinter, practice with your starting blocks the day before.

, Both carbohydrates and protein are important sources of energy for your body. Healthy forms of protein include chicken, fish, and tofu. Good sources of carbs include whole grain bread, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, brown rice, bananas, and blueberries., Soda, sugary juices, and even sports drinks aren’t good for you. Choose water instead to keep your body properly hydrated., It’s important to get plenty of rest before a track meet. Go to bed early to ensure you get adequate rest. Teens should get 9 to 9 ½ hours of sleep each night., Listen to the advice your coach gives you and ask them any questions you have. They will be happy to help, and it'll be better to get these questions off your chest before you compete.

, Choose a breakfast with protein and carbs, but avoid greasy foods and butter. Be sure to eat at least two hours before you are scheduled to compete in an event so your body has time to digest the food.You should also bring a few snacks with you to the meet. Snacks such as honey, peanut butter, apples, cheese, and granola bars are good choices., It’s essential that you drink enough water leading up to and during a track meet. As a general rule, men should drink 13 cups (about 3 liters) and women should drink 9 cups (a little over 2 liters) of water each day.Drink extra water to compensate for fluids lost through sweat when exercising.
Be sure to bring plenty of water with you to the meet so you can hydrate throughout the day.

, Take some time to calm down before the meet starts. Practice yoga, imagine yourself in a happy place, or listen to your favorite music.Give yourself positive encouragement by saying or thinking things like “I am ready,” and “I can do this!”

, Being late for the meet will stress you out and could throw off your game. Be sure to leave extra time in the morning in case you run into traffic or have other issues., A sunburn is not a good reward for all your hard work. Apply sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every 2-3 hours while outdoors.You can also visualize the meet and see yourself competing to the best of your abilities.

, Be sure to stretch and warm up about 25-30 minutes before competing in an event. You can do the same warm-ups you do in practice. Just be sure not to over-exert yourself before the meet begins., You can have an energy gel about 15 minutes before the race. Energy gels have complex sugars, and are more efficient than simple sports drinks.

, Put all your passion and training to work the day of the meet. Give each event your all. It doesn’t matter so much if you win or lose if you gave your best effort."

, Plan to winterize the jet ski directly after the last ride.

, Secure it on the trailer. Drive just a few feet onto the ramp and stop.


In order to drain the water, the stern will need to be higher than the bow of your jet ski.

,


Start the engine while it is out of the water. Turn the steering handle from side to side. Water will wick off from the engine.






Turn the engine off after 30 seconds. Stop the engine and let it rest for 30 seconds. Start it again twice more with a rest period in between.

, Place it on a stand where it will sit above the ground.


Your storage area should be far away from any flammable materials. Winterized jet skis are usually stored with some gas in the tank, so use caution.
Make sure your jet ski is level on its base. If it is on a trailer, place wooden planks behind the wheels.

, Buy some car washing soap and use warm water if possible.


Clean the jet ski immediately after your last ride, if possible. The algae and other dirt will be easier to loosen from the body.
Use a large, soft sponge to cover the exterior with warm water and soap. Go over each area several times, since the grime is tougher to remove than car dirt.
Use a non-abrasive brush to scrub harder near the bottom of your jet ski. You will need to remove all the algae.
Rinse the jet ski thoroughly. Dry it with soft towels completely.

, If there is water, dry it with soft towels.

, Some boat supply stores may recommend more specialized products.

, Allow it to sit according to package directions. Wipe off the wax.

Use the speed of the boat or jet ski to pull you up onto the board.,
Sit in the water with the board by your feet.,
Place your heels on the board close to the edge.,
Get the boat moving slowly until the line is tense.,
Bend your knees and keep the line in front of your body.,
Let the boat pull you up as it gains speed.,
Turn the board so that your dominant foot is towards the boat.,
Keep your chest up, arms straight, and feet staggered to start riding.",How to Wakeskate1," The theory of wakeskating is not incredibly difficult to understand, but putting it into practice is much harder. You start in the water with your heels on the top of the board and the board perpendicular to the back of the boat. Holding onto a rope attached the boat, let the boat pull you behind it until you have enough speed to stand up on the board. Once your stand, you pivot your feet so that the front of the board faces the boat, and you're off.


Getting up is almost identical to a getting up on a wakeboard.;
, Before you tell the boat to get moving, get comfortable in this seated position. Your butt should be the lowest point, with your lifejacket keeping your head and torso above the water. The board will be perpendicular to the boat.


If you are right-footed, the front of the board faces to the right. This is also known as ""goofy"" stance, or ""goofy-footed.""
If you are left-footed, the front of the board faces to the left. This is a standard, or regular, stance.

, Your toes will be near the center of the board. Keep your heels on the board so that you could push down on them and flip the far edge of the board towards you if you wanted to.


There will be 2-4 inches between the edge of the board and you heels.

, This will ""push"" the board up to your feet so that your entire sole is on the board. The pressure of the water will keep the board on your feet.

, Bend your knees about halfway, like you were preparing to jump off the board. Your arms will be straight in front of you so that your hands are ahead of your knees.Think of performing a squat (without weight) -- your knees are bent, your butt is down, and your arms are strong.

, This takes some practice, but once you get a feel for the balance it is actually not too difficult. Once the board is comfortably on your feet and the line is taut, slowly stand up on the board. With your knees relaxed, keep your hands out in front and unbend your knees as you let the boat pull you to a standing position.


The boat should be going 13-16mph.
Don't lock your knees -- they should still be slightly bent as you stand up in an athletic position.

, Put pressure on your back foot (the left, if you are right-footed/goofy rider) to turn the board so that it is parallel to the boat.

, If you are right footed, your right foot is in front and slightly to the right of your back foot. Once you're up, the basic body positioning is similar to snowboarding or skateboarding:


Knees slightly bent.
Equal weight on both feet.
Handle at waist height.
Chest ""tall,"" not hunched over or leaning back."

After the jump.",How to Win Long Jump,";
, Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and fall forward. The leg which you catch yourself with is your take off leg. Repeat this 3 or more times to make sure it is correct.

, The board should have a normal white plank with a thinner strip of wooden material. Line the back of your foot up with the wooden strip so you are close but not touching it. This board should be just before the sand pit. Run back up the track and count either 13,15 or 17 strides. Run through and get someone else to put a mark down.

, Run through as if you were going to jump at the end, and get someone to see where your foot was on the plank. If it was on/touching the wooden part, then it would be a no jump. If this happens, then you will have to adjust the marker until you get on the board perfectly. Don't jump when you are running through.

, Run as fast as you can, exactly as you did before when you were running through the jump, because speed will carry you further. Don't look at the board or think about it. Look as far as you can into the distance, not downward. This will help you jump further, too.Fling your arms up as high as you can, and bring your legs forward, when you hit the board.Try to throw yourself into the jump so that you get enough momentum to jump without falling backwards or putting your hands behind you.

, Land with your legs bent and in front of you and reaching for your toes. The judges will measure to the furthest point in ""back"" of your landing, made in the sand; so, fall forward.

, Always remember to walk out the side or front of the long jump pit.

Be comfortable with water skiing.,
Have a good sense of balance.,
Start with the bar.,
Practice on the bar until you are comfortable with the balance.,
Try the rope.,
Go out of the wake.,
Do some tricks!,
Slalom trick ski.",How to Trick Ski," Although trick skiing is meant to be done with two skis, it can be difficult to learn if you've never water skied before. This is because the skis have no fins, which is more unusual than it sounds. Because of the lack of fins, you easily slip around, which makes things like three-sixties easier. If you can't water ski on skis with fins, you'll never be able to get up on trick skis.;
, Trick skiing requires knowing your point of balance, and being aware of how to balance. Since the skis have no fins, you'll be slipping around the wake. If you can't balance well, you'll slide backwards and flop right out of your skis!

, It's very difficult to keep your balance on trick skis, and starting with the bar will help. It steadies you so you can't slip side to side too much, and helps you get a feel for how you need to balance on the rope.

, Even if you've water skied before, skiing with no fins is a totally different experience. It will take a while to get used to the feeling of being on trick skis before you can advance to the next level.

, The rope is a different level because you are free to slide around, and can easily slip and fall backwards. Get up the same way you would with regular skis: have the rope in between your skis with the tips of them over water, and call out to the driver when you're ready. The boat should be going around ten miles (sixteen kilometres) per hour for a beginner. Once you're up, get the feel for your balance by sliding around a bit.

, This isn't as simple as it seems. Because the skis have no fins, it's difficult to get over a mound, such as the wake, without sliding off and falling. Bend your knees, and slowly approach the wake with cautious speed. Brace yourself as you go over the wake, and press out a little while you're out. Don't press too hard, or you'll fall. After a lot of practice, you'll be able to go very far outside of the wake comfortably.

, Now that you have the basics down, it's time to do some tricks. You can do things like one-eighties, three-sixties, and cool jumps! If you know of someone who can trick ski, ask them for some tips. Or you can hire an instructor for an hour. After you're experienced in tricks, you can even try making up your own!

, This is possibly the hardest feat to accomplish in water skiing. Before attempting this, you should be able to slalom ski easily. Get up how you would on a normal slalom ski, and balance while up. With a lot of practice, you could even do tricks with one trick ski!

Lie down in the water on your back and wrap your feet around the rope.,
When there is no more slack in the rope dive your head in the water like you're trying to touch the bottom of the lake with the top of your head.,
As soon as your head is in the water your driver should hit it.,
After the boat reaches a certain speed you will feel your body glide on the water - this is a good sign.,
When the boat reaches your bare-footing speed take your feet off the rope and gently put your heels in the water.,
If ever you fall, curl up into a ball and brace for impact.

",How to Get up Barefeet Without Any Skis,";
, Take a breath and hold on for dear life!.

, Keep your head back and don't breathe.

, Keep your feet on the rope and slowly sit on the water. Do not get up yet.

, Don't become a digger, and there you go, you have just accomplished a front deep start.

Begin your day early.,
For breakfast, eat plenty of fiber and Carbs.,
Before the run, stretch out as much as possible.,
After stretching, do at least six 60-100 meter strides.,
When all the runners are rounded at the starting line, try to be somewhere between the middle lane, and the furthest out lane, for being in one of the first lanes leaves you prone to being blocked at the start.

,
Focus.,
At the sound of the gun, or whatever begins the race, stride to the general front area.,
Stay directly behind him, her, or them.,
Keep this pace up for the first lap.,
On lap number two, slow down.,
Maintain this pace.,
Speed up.,
This is it.,
Release every last bit of energy.,
Finish till you pass the line.,
Keep walking.,
When at home, eat, shower, then sleep.,
Start practicing.",How to Run a Mile and a Half," Sleeping in will leave you drowsy, or not up to your optimum alertness.;
, An example of a good breakfast on the day of the run/race is dry cereal, banana, muffin, and orange juice. This will provide potassium and fiber, along with carbs and vitamin C, which provides muscle strength. If you are running in the morning, the best quick breakfast is orange juice and a peanut butter only sandwich.

, Make sure you at least stretch your thighs and calves.
, This will get your blood pumping and your body warmed up.

,, Breathe. Calm down. Do exactly what the instructor tells you.

, Do not sprint, you will die out if you do. Being close to the front separates you from those who can not keep up, yet allows you to analyze the race. Once analyzed, which should take seconds, find someone whom you know you can keep up with.

, This is called drafting. Drafting is a method used by many runners, which breaks the wind from hitting the runner. This lets you save more energy, while the runner(s) ahead wear out.

, If you can safely pass without wearing yourself out, do so now.

, The timekeeper will tell you your time. If you know what your time is, you are either running too fast, or you are running at a great pace for you. Adjust.

, Whether you are in first place, or you are in 10th, keep this pace until lap number five. The majority of runners in the race will slow down, for they most likely went too fast and will eventually wear out. You will eventually catch up, and you will stay ahead if you are in first.

, This is the fifth lap. If you're in first, try to separate yourself even more. If you are behind, pick up the pace and ignore the pain. Your body will not want to speed up, but you will have to fight back. This is where the vitamin C and vitamin D kick in. Try to catch up to the person in front. After obtaining this objective, move on to the next person, and so on.

, Pick up your pace to threshold. This is where your body will want to slow down, and your thighs feel like lead. Threshold is a bit faster than race pace. If you are shooting for a record, or you are behind and need to catch up ASAP, then go to a pace just below sprinting.

, On the last 100-250 meters, depending on your capability, sprint with your heart. Keep your head facing forward, and move your legs rapidly, do not go for long strides.

, Whether or not you finish in first, keep sprinting past the line. Most runners tend to slow down in the last ten meters, hence a runner passes them.
, Keep moving. Don't stop. Cool down. Stretch. Assess. Pat yourself on the back, you did great. Talk to your coach. Head to every single player you raced and shake hands with them. Adding a ""good race"" wouldn't hurt.

, You will feel much better when you wake up, and you will have improved due to racing, eating, and sleeping.

, After one day of rest, begin to practice again. Repeat process from step one.

Put pressure on your feet to move the board around.,
Lean into the edges to turn.,
Turn out of the wake for smoother skating.,
Use the edge of the wake like a ramp to get some air.,
Perform a simple ollie, or jump, in the water.,
Try out some skateboarding tricks.",How to Wakeskate2," ""Pushing"" down with your feet causes the board to accelerate or decelerate. Push on your front foot to move forward and on your back foot to slow down, but only as much as the rope will allow.

, You want to ensure your chest is always over your toes, and you are utilizing your heel and toe edges to do the turning. Lean the way you want to turn-- if you are right footed and want to go right, lean into your heels.


You are dipping a bit of the boards edge into the water in order to turn.

, The wake is the triangular surf behind the boat's engine, and it is often bumpy to ride behind. Turn your board out of the wake for the smooth waters on the sides, especially if you plan on trying out some ""flat water"" tricks.


Be ready for a bump at the edge of the wake. While it can take some getting used to, having a solid core and slightly bent knees will work wonders.

, Once you're comfortable turning it is time to get some air. Get outside of the wake then turn quickly back towards it. Put light pressure on your back foot to push the nose in the air and keep your knees bent as you hit the wake, popping you into the air. Slightly extend your legs so that you can bend your knees on the landing, much like you would after jumping off a high ledge.


Pull the rope in 2-3 inches to keep it tight as you start the jump., The form is the same for jumping on a skateboard, but it is still simple even if you've never skated. Get to some flat water either in the center of the wake or on the outside. Put pressure on your back foot so that the front sticks up out of the water, then use both feet to hop up, sucking the board up with you. The board should follow.


Your feet will need to be back a bit so that the back foot is near the end of the board., The mechanics of wakeskating are similar to skateboarding, so anyone with a background on a board can transition easily into the burgeoning watersport.Some tricks to try out include:


Riding one-handed.
Spinning 180 or 360 degrees.
Kickflip.
Pop Shovit.

Know that boards are made of wood or plastic foam (composite) materials.,
Choose the right size for your weight and skill level.,
Get a foam top board if you want to ride barefoot.,
Get fins on your board for greater stability.,
Invest in a good pair of shoes.,
Get a light, foam-topped board with fins if you are just starting out.",How to Wakeskate3," The traditional wakeskate board is made of pressed wood just like a skateboard. Recent interest in the sport has led to more high-tech designs that use a plastic foam core. Wooden boards tend to react more like skateboards and respond well to tricks, whereas composite boards float a little lighter and feel like wakeboards.


Composite boards tend to last longer and are usually more expensive., Board size is always measured in inches, and the size you buy depends on you as a skater. Lighter boards move slower but respond well to tricks, while bigger boards have more buoyancy and speed through the water.


39-41 inches: Riders who weigh 90-170lbs, beginners and intermediates.
42-43 inches: Riders who weigh 150-200lbs, intermediate riders.
44-46 inches: Riders who weigh more than 180lbs, advanced riders., While they have slightly less control than a grip-tape board, foam-topped boards are great for beginners. You can wear shoes with them as well, but many people find it easier to learn barefoot because they can feel the boards movement better., The only issue is that fins make it more difficult to break the surface of the water and get air. Still, fins are good for beginners or those who want to focus on speed and comfortable riding.Many boards come with removable fins, allowing you to adapt your board to your riding style or skill level.

, Wakeskaters have a wide variety of shoes to choose from, as most regular athletic shoes will work just fine. Many wakeskaters prefer normal skateboard shoes because they are designed to interact with the surface of the board for grip and stability. Wakeskate specific shoes, however, have drainage channels and quick-drying material for added comfort on the board.Unless you're planning to do tricks, jumps and other stunts you can use regular athletic shoes or skateboarding shoes.

, These boards are more forgiving to ride, have added stability, and can be ridden with shoes or barefoot. Talk to the staff at your watersports shop about finding the correct size for you if you have any questions, but know that you do not need a ""perfect"" board to get riding. With a little practice and the right board for your weight you will be up in no time.

Practice landing on grass or dirt first.,
Make sure your landing area is clear, if you need to jump from some high place.,
Prepare to jump.,
Stretch your leg muscles so you don't pull anything.,
Land on the front edge (the ball) of your foot, right behind where all the toes join.,
Flex the knees a little before landing and while landing; bend your legs, doing a partial squat (not past 90 degrees), allowing the large muscles of the legs to absorb much of the energy, then rising, straighten your body upward.

",How to Stop Ground Shock,";
, Not too high: maybe start by trying 1 meter (approx. 3 feet) and practice that; then consider 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 meters (4 to 5 feet) off the ground. You also have to become pretty good at landing correctly.

, Get yourself comfortable for the jump. Remember, you're jumping onto a hard surface.

, This is when you try to stop ground shock and not pull any muscles.

, Landing flat on the ball of your foot or completely on your sole of the foot won't prevent ground shock as much.

Eat a good breakfast.,
Aim to incorporate 1-2 light snacks between meals.,
Pack enough lunch.,
Eat a balanced dinner.,
Hydrate.,
Focus on timing.",How to Eat to Run," The body's metabolism is most efficient between 7 and 9 AM, so be sure to pack in as much nutrition as possible during this time.


Avoid caffeine. Though coffee is hard for many of us to quit, caffeine highs-and-lows can be detrimental to your running.
Be sure to get in some fiber. High-fiber breakfast options include oatmeal (cook the oats with walnuts or almonds for extra protein), whole wheat toast with an all-natural nut butter and sliced banana, or low-fat granola.
Try to include some fruit at breakfast. This can be easily done via sliced fruit over oatmeal/granola, or through a smoothie. If you chose to make a smoothie, try to include some greens in it (e.g. kale or spinach). If you throw a small handful of nuts into the smoothie, it can be a great healthy breakfast on-the-go.
Stay away from foods that may give you stomach gas while you're running. Eggs and heavy meats (e.g. bacon, sausage) tend to have this effect.;
, These will help keep your metabolism moving, and your body will thank you for the extra fuel during your workout. Good snacks for runners can include but are not limited to:


A small handful of raw or roasted nuts, preferably low-salt.
A granola bar (though do be careful for sugary bars disguised as health foods).
Whole-wheat crackers with hummus or another light dip.
Fruit or sliced veggies.

, Running is a high-intensity sport, and you need to be prepared to fuel your body.


Stay away from store-bought lunches. Deli sandwiches, and other typical lunch fare tend to be high in saturated fats, sodium, and preservatives which most of us should be avoiding anyway, even if we are not competitive athletes.
Do get in some protein. Nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains are excellent sources of protein, as well as limited quantities of lean meats like chicken and fish.
Include a full serving of vegetables during lunch. This can take the form of a salad, a vegetable juice, or it can be incorporated into the main course of your lunch.

,


Avoid alcohol. Though it is not harmful when consumed in very limited quantities, cutting back on alcohol can positively affect your running.
Again, fuel up with protein. Legumes like lentils and beans, as well as whole grains like farro, quinoa, and brown rice are great sources of heart-healthy protein which will keep your muscles functioning at top speed during your workouts.
Do not fear carbs. Good carbohydrates like whole grain pasta are not only filling and delicious, but they will provide you with the energy you'll need to push you body to new limits.

, You will be amazed at how a few more glasses of water a day will improve your running.


Limit so-called ""sport drinks."" These are very high in sugar, and are usually unnecessary for your average recreational runner. Save these for after races or particularly strenuous workouts.
However, do be sure to get in enough electrolytes/minerals to allow your body to make use of the water it's consuming. Drinks like coconut water are low in sugar, but contain a good dose of electrolytes.

, If you are running in a couple of hours, have a light snack. If you are running quite soon, try not to eat, and limit water consumption to avoid getting side-cramps during your run. Always try to have something to eat after your run. Feed your body!

Knowing how much you're able and willing to run will help you find a virtual race that's perfect for you.Think of what your personal goals are and strive for them.


The most common virtual race distances are the 5K (3.1 miles), 10K (6.2 miles) and half marathon (21K or 13 miles).Look for a race that you can realistically run based on your physical ability.
Consult a doctor before racing if you have any health conditions.;
, You can run your race anywhere you want. Determine if you want to run your race on a treadmill, along with a racing path, or on the sidewalk. Plot out a racing route that fulfills the requirements for the virtual race. If you have other people who want to do the race with you, you can organize a day where you can all do the race together.


Think of the weather. If it's extremely cold or hot out, you may want to run your race indoors.

, Search online for virtual races that you're eligible for. Virtual races often donate a portion of their proceeds to a charity, so take a look at the race company's website to see which charity they are giving to. Look for virtual races that donate to a cause that is close to you. Take down a list of all the virtual races that you're interested in so that you can choose the right one for you.


You can also type ""virtual race"" into online app stores to find virtual race apps.
Some virtual races, like The Race for Awareness, donates much of their proceeds to disease and virus research., Once you have a list of different race options, figure out what is important to you. Weigh If you're looking to interact with other people, as some virtual races have a closely knit community and leaderboards. If you'd rather use an app, there are virtual race apps that can help track your progress using your smartphone.Traditional virtual races rely on the honor system when reporting racer results.
For cyclists, Zwift Virtual Training Platform is a great virtual race app that can track your progress and has an online community that you can compete with., Once you've decided on what kind of goals you want to meet on your race, you can choose an available package that most closely fits what you're looking for. Some races allow you to designate your own personal goals, rather than setting a distance to run. If you aren't used to running a lot, look for a race that allows you to set your own goals.


Races that allow you to set your own goals include the Civil Rights Awareness Race and the Empowering Girls Virtual Race., Once you've figured out exactly what race you want to run, find the sponsoring virtual race company and fill out the registration page online. The race sponsors will usually need payment, as well as an address, to send you your medals or rewards. A virtual race is at your pace, so there's no pressure to complete it, but some races have registration deadlines.On average, races cost $25 to $30.

, Once you register for the race, figure out where and when you'll be racing. You can set whatever time and place is most convenient for your schedule. If you plan on running on an indoor track or a treadmill at a gym, make sure that the track's operating hours coordinate with your schedule. Choose a route that you're already accustomed to, and map out the distance on a map.


Places to run include the sidewalk, trails, parks, and the beach., A dynamic workout that includes pushups, jumping jacks, and lunges will get your heart rate up and prepare your muscles for a race. Make sure to stay hydrated and to drink plenty of water before and after the race. Being dehydrated during a race will reduce your performance and is harmful to your health.Plot your race in a neighborhood or path that you are comfortable and familiar with.

, Preparing properly for the race means doing some test runs to see how your body feels when running long distances. In addition to practicing for the race, you should also make sure that you get enough sleep and to maintain a healthy diet leading up to the race. Make sure that you get enough sleep leading up to the race, as being tired can be a major contributor to decreased performance.


A balanced diet is a good balance of proteins, fruits, vegetables, and grains.

, Take your time and run the race at a comfortable pace. There are leader boards in virtual races sometimes, but there are no time requirements, in most cases, to receive a medal or reward. If you feel tired during the race, slow your pace down until you feel rejuvenated enough to go back to your regular running speed. Don't exert all of your energy in a short period and try to keep a healthy jogging pace. Do your best to meet the goals of the race and push yourself to finish.Remember to regulate your breathing while you run.

, Many virtual race companies will request that you send them race results to receive your medal. This is typically in the form of a picture of you finishing the race and celebrating your victory. Other companies will have you partake in social media and share your results with other virtual racers.Follow the directions for your virtual race once you've finished.

Overcome mental blocks.",How to Run a 5k2," If you are physically fit, you may only need to get into the habit of running.

, Many organizations, including Couch to 5K, the Running Planet and the Mayo Clinic offer programs that allow people with no running or fitness backgrounds to train for a 5K.


Start slowly, with walking and running intervals. Most programs will have you walk for 90 seconds, then run for 60 seconds until you reach the point where you can run for 5 km (3.1 mi).

, Even if you do not run every day, getting enough physical activity on a daily basis to prepare you for a 5K is essential.


Choose another type of exercise for the days you do not run. This might be swimming, a sport like tennis or basketball or an aerobics class at the gym.

, Many people find getting support from another runner is helpful while training for a 5K. Recruit a friend, neighbor or family member.

, Your body will do a better job of training to run a 5K when it is fueled with lean proteins, fiber and the vitamins and minerals that come from fresh fruits and vegetables.


Drink plenty of water. While you are training, your body will require and use additional fluids. Drink water all day long.

, You might worry that you are too fat, too slow or just unable to run for the entire distance. Work through those so you are as mentally strong as you are physically strong.

Set your blocks.,
Do your ritual.,
Get in your first position.,
Listen for the set command.,
Consider using a standing start.",How to Run a 200M Dash1," Find your assigned lane and use the length of your feet to gauge where to place the blocks. The tip of the unit should measure about a foot length from the starting line.The front pedal should be 2 to 2 1/4 foot lengths from the starting line. The back pedal should be 3 to 3 1/4 foot lengths from the line.Your lead foot is your stronger foot. Go with whichever foot you'd use to kick a soccer ball.
Since the standard track lap is 400m, a 200m dash is half a lap, so you'll be starting on a curve.
Runners set themselves on diagonally staggered start lines to compensate for the differences in distance between the first and last lanes.
For beginners, or if you’re just running a dash in gym class, it’s not necessary to use starting blocks. However, if you plan on running sprints competitively, you should get used to using them.;
, Generally, the four commands are stand in your lanes, runners to your marks, set, and then the gun. Before hearing the signals to get set and go, you’ll be told to get in your lane. Now’s your chance to stretch, do your pre-race ritual, and get your mind set for a good race. Even the best get nervous just before the race, so now’s the time to get those jitters out.Try bending over and touching your toes to stretch the back of your legs. Stretch your quads by lifting each leg backward from the knee while standing straight and reaching back to hold your foot.
Shake out your arms and legs to get blood flowing.
Breathe deeply, counting to four, holding for a four count, then exhaling as you count to four. You don't want to relax too much or make yourself sleepy, but should get your mind locked on the race itself as you fill your body with oxygen.
Focus your vision by staring at the track, and get the crowd, other racers, and any other distractions out of your field of vision. Concentrate only on the race, and imagine how you'll burst from your starting blocks, speed down the track, and make a great time.

, When you’re told to get to your mark, get in your blocks, clear your mind, and prepare to listen for the gun. Comfortably put yourself in a crouching position with your back knee on the ground and your weight resting on your fingertips. Hold your fingertips just inside your starting line and position your body so your shoulders are directly above your hands.If you're using blocks, make sure your lead toe is off the ground and completely in the blocks.
If you're not using starting blocks, you can still use a crouching start. Position your front toe so it's a foot length back from the starting line. Get yourself in the same coiled position with your fingers flanking the line.

, When you hear the set command, raise your hips and rear end. Put your body in a loaded position, ready to spring from the blocks. Your legs should be ready to fire as soon as you hear the gun, or go command.Keep your back and your waist aligned in a straight line in order to get the best take-off.
Slowly inhale and fill your lung capacity during your set.

, Although many meetings require blocks for dashes, you could skip the blocks and use a standing start if you're not racing competitively or if blocks are not required. Position your lead foot one length back from the starting line, and line up your rear foot's toes with your lead heel.Feet should be shoulder length apart, and you should be slightly crouched so your weight rests on the balls of your feet. Your knees should be slightly bent.
When you hear the start command, swing the arm opposite your lead leg forward as you lift your rear foot. Propel yourself forward using your lead leg.
Lean forward into long, powerful strides to accelerate into a sprint.

Train extensively weeks before the race.,
Take time to recover.,
Keep track of your training times.,
Rest before the big race.",How to Run a 20:00 5K1," By developing a training regimen you'll be able to improve your time drastically. Try doing the following exercises to train for a 5K:


Run up hills. Be sure to be perpendicular to the hill and lift your knees, using the proper healthy running form.
Run intervals. Run the mile four times, an 800 six times, a 600 eight times, or a 400 ten times. Vary these. Miles should be close to race pace with 3-5 minutes rest intervals. The 600s and 800s work best at 5 seconds per 400 faster than race pace and 2-3 minutes rest interval. 400s in 86-92 would develop adequate speed. Rest 1:30 between each 400
Practice speeding up when you run. Run a comfortable pace then speed up for about 50 to 100 meters then slow down again. Repeat.
Run hard courses. Most people do not run very fast when practicing so it is best to run hard courses to still speed up.;
, Don't overtrain. Remember it takes your body 3-4 days to recover from a reps session. Ideally do this on a Monday or Tuesday and race on a Saturday.

, Running 5K in less than 20 minutes requires running at 6:26 pace for 3.1 miles (5.0 km). You need to be able to run at least a 6:00 mile before you run this 5k under 20 minutes. This alone still won't guarantee you your goal time. You must train regularly.

, Do not do push ups, pull ups or any other strenuous activities. Just stretch and spend time relaxing.


Eat pasta for dinner. Muscles receive energy from glucose which is found in pasta.
Go to bed early and make sure you get enough good quality rest before your big race.
Wake up early. Save yourself enough time to eat a good, but light breakfast at least an hour before the race.

Find a table, lots of plastic cups, and plenty of water.,
Just before the race begins, make sure you have 20-50 cups ready for the first crowd of runners.,
When the runners come by, be ready!,
Fill those cups fast!,
Watch out for shy people.,
Manners aren't the runners' priority, and they shouldn't be yours, either.,
Expect to be splashed.,
Have fun!",How to Give People Water During a Race," Round up a few people to help you out- three is a good number. Assign one ""filler"" (someone to rapidly put cups on the table and fill them with water) and two ""passers"" (people to pass out water to the runners).;
, Each cup should be filled about halfway.

, Take one cup in each hand and stretch your arms out so passing runners can take the cups. Grip it loosely at the bottom so they are easy to grab.

, After the first group clears, more and more runners will be passing your way. The filler should keep the cups coming, and the passers should be running back and forth as quickly as they can, so all runners get water.

, There are always a few people who are too bashful to snatch the water out of your hands. If anyone looks thirsty (panting, red-faced, etc.) but hasn't taken water, offer them a cup. If they refuse, that's fine, but if they accept, you know you've done something good.

, A simple ""you're welcome"" to a runner's ""thank you"" is fine."" Remember, though, that most of these people can hardly breathe, let alone talk. Expect some people to ignore you completely, and others to grab the water and not say a word.

, It's going to happen when you have people racing by and snatching water out of your hand. Don't worry about a spill. Watch out certain people, though, who will slap your hand and cause the water to fly into your face. Most likely, they are crabby from all of that running and looking for a laugh. Besides- it's just water!

, Tell the runners that they're doing a terrific job. Splash water on people if they ask (or if they look like they need it.) Throw some water on your friends. It's all for a good cause!

Listen for the “B” of the “Bang.” This runner’s mantra warns against starting too late into the bang of the gun.,
Breath every 10 to 15 meters.,
Stay low.,
Bring your body upright.",How to Run a 200M Dash2," Explode from the blocks as soon as you hear the bang. Reaction time is vital to any race, and is especially important to sprints, which are often decided by mere milliseconds.You might hear a second shot from the gun. This signals someone has false started, so runners must return to their starting spots.

, Try to take deep breaths at regular intervals to avoid cramping and to maintain a good rhythm. If you feel like to need to take a breath, then take one. The most important breath you take is the one during your set position: it’ll oxygenate your body and help you focus.


Although it’s certainly not advisable, for some short-distance races, some of the greats barely even breathed at all., Fire out low from the blocks and stay low for the first 10 meters: you should not be running upright, but leaning slightly forward. Keep your eyes trained toward the ground. Pump your legs hard and use your arms to power your acceleration., As you approach the 20-meter mark, begin to come into an upright position. You should be completely upright at 20 meters as you shift from accelerating to full speed running. By the time you reach 30 meters, you should be running at your maximum speed."
"
Nail the turn.,
Relax your run.,
Lean forward into your finish.",How to Run a 200M Dash3," Since you’re starting on a curve, you’ve got to hug the inside of your lane to maximize acceleration. Aggressively lean into the inside of your lane in order to take advantage of your centripetal force.Once you come out of the curve and into the straightaway, get your upper body back into its straight and upright form.Different lanes have different curve angles. Lane one has one of the tightest turns, while lanes seven and eight have very wide turns.
Many runners will try to get to the center lanes, where turns are most manageable, but taller runners tend to do well on the outside lanes, where the turn radius is widest., After accelerating powerfully and getting to full speed around 30 meters, keep tall and relax your sprint as you approach the finish. Relaxing your sprint doesn't mean slow down: you’ll still be all-out sprinting. You do, however, want to maintain full speed by concentrating on good running form to waste the least amount of energy:Be sure to keep pumping your arms. Your hands should reach up to your eye level.
Try to run on the balls of your feet.

, Leaning can mean the difference between 1st and 2nd place in a short-distance race. Most 200 meter dashes are won or lost by a small fraction of a second. As you approach the finish line, speed up and lean slightly forward, making sure you run through the line by imagining your finishing point is beyond the line itself."
"
Take on a conditioning regimen.,
Practice by running longer distances.,
Keep your eye on the track.",How to Run a 200M Dash4," If you’re in a gym class or on the track team, your coach will make sure you’re conditioning yourself properly. However, if you’re working on your speed and endurance on your own, you’ll have to design your own drills to get yourself into the best shape. There are plenty of resources available through an internet search, but some basic drills include:Warm up with 2 to 5 minutes of light jogging and a core exercise like crunches, run six to eight 200 meter dashes at 75% effort, cool down with a 2 to 5 minute light jog and leg stretches.Good stretches include sitting with your legs in front of you while reaching for your toes, and holding the soles of your feet together with your knees bent in a butterfly stretch.Sprint drills: warm up with 10 minutes of jogging, then alternate 100 meters each of sprint, walk, jog. Rest for 3 minutes, then repeat this 100 meter sprint-walk-jog., A 200 meter sprint is a speed endurance challenge, so you’ve got to build your aerobic endurance level if you’re going to succeed. If you’re running a 200 meter, practice by running 300 and 400 meter distances. Running longer distances will make shorter distances that much easier.

, When you’re training, work on keeping your eyes on the track and finish line. Research shows that if you look around elsewhere for just a second, you slow down. Make your focus and concentration priorities during practice."
"
Warm up.,
Start fast but not too fast.,
Check your time.,
Finish strong by sprinting at the end.",How to Run a 20:00 5K2," If it is cold on race day, keep your muscles warm by stretching. Do some quick sprints up to 100m right before the race.


Do dynamic stretching beforehand, not static. Dynamic is more moving (i.e. Lunges) and static is more still (i.e. Touching your toes).

, You don't want to run out of gas early. Try to find someone your pace and settle yourself near the front at the start. Pick an athlete just in front of you who looks experienced - grey haired vets are ideal - imagine a rope between the two of you and that rope shortening until you are on their shoulder.

, If there are mile markers you might want to keep track of your time along the way. If you realize that you are running too slow then you can speed up.


Your first mile should be about 6:25, but preferably faster.
Get your second mile split. It should be under 13:00.

, Empty the rest of what's in your tank and give it all you've got. Check your time and celebrate.

Develop a training schedule.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Work on your general fitness.,
Start distance training.,
Perform sprint intervals.,
Run hills.,
Mark your progress.,
Stretch properly.,
Prepare yourself mentally.,
Do a pre-race warmup.,
Pace yourself.",How to Run a 5 Minute Mile," You’ll never beat a five minute mile without a plan and proper schedule. For the best results, you should be training almost every day, incorporating different exercises.Start your week with a distance run, running for at least 40 minutes or about 3 miles, and gradually increasing that as you train.
Take the next day to rest or do some other training like yoga or weight lifting.
Pick a few days a week to do interval or hill training, followed by another day of rest or cross training.;
, In order to get your body into the right shape for a 5 minute mile, eating the right diet that will give your body energy is important, and it will help it to recover after training.Get the right proteins through eggs, sweet potatoes, salmon, and chicken. Proteins like salmon contain ingredients like omega-3 essential fatty acids which increase heart health and help performance.
Leafy greens like kale contain a wealth of vitamins that keep your body healthy and moving like vitamins A, B6, C, and K.Whole wheat pasta in the right portions will provide you with the carbs you need to maximize muscle glycogen stores., If you want to run a 5 minute mile you need to train your body in other ways than just running to get into shape. Other exercises will not only help you run faster, but will help prevent injury and increase form. Planks are a great way to strengthen your core, lower back, and shoulders; three areas that are important for a fast run. Hold planks for 45 seconds and do 3-5 reps.
Kettlebell squats will work your glutes and leg muscles while also strengthening your core. Do 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps.

Do some yoga to help you improve flexibility, recover faster, and simply destress., In order to be able to push your body hard enough to complete a mile in 5 minutes, you need to build a solid base of aerobic conditioning. Start conditioning your body beginning with longer runs.Aim for 5 or 6 mile runs that you can complete in an average of eight minutes per mile.
Run several days a week to get your body used to running distances, and record run times.
As you continue your training, shoot to improve your time to an average of about seven minutes per mile.

, At least twice a week you need to start running in intervals to train your body for speed. While distance running with help you with your heart and lungs, it won’t necessarily make you faster.400-meter sprint intervals. Do six intervals of 400-meters, resting for 1 minute between each sprint. Start at a decent pace and increase it with each interval.
600-meter sprint intervals. Now run six to eight intervals at a distance of 600-meters, resting for 1-2 minutes in between each repetition.
Alternate these interval sprints and perform them on days you are not going on distance runs.

, Hill running is a great way to build strength and increase your endurance. Look for a hill that will take you several minutes to reach the top of so that you can ensure that you’re actually building muscle.Begin your hill climb at a nice jogging pace, especially at the beginning of your training.
Once you’ve run about ¾ the way up the hill, sprint the remaining ¼. Repeat this run at least three times. Walk down the hill at a nice pace to recover from your climb, using this as your resting time.
Don’t strain your body by doing too many hill climbs a week. Substitute one or two of your sprint intervals for hill climbs.

, Not only will marking your progress help you to see how you’re improving, but it will also motivate you to keep pushing yourself. You will be able to see areas where you might not be improving as quickly as you want to.


Get a runner’s watch or use an app on your phone to track your times and mileage.
Write down your distances and times in your training schedule after you have completed them. This way, you can easily see your progress as you train.

, There’s no magic formula for running a mile in 5 minutes, but making sure that you are limbered up and properly stretched out will help to prevent injury and cramping during your run.


Stretch your back, quadriceps and adductors, hamstrings, hip flexors, and glutes.
Make sure that you also stretch after you’ve completed your run as well.

, Breaking 5 minutes is no easy task, you’ve trained and trained, and you feel ready. Now it’s time to breath, relax, and visualize yourself running a fast mile, hitting that mile marker in 5 minutes.


Envision yourself crossing the finish line. Let yourself experience how good it will feel to have accomplished this.
By telling yourself that you can achieve a 5 minute mile, you will put yourself in a positive mindset that will energize you.

, Don’t go nuts though, you don’t want to tire yourself out. A quick warmup, however, will get your heart rate going and awaken your muscles.


Do a few quick sprints to get the motion down and into your body.
You can also try some jumping jacks to get your heart rate up.

, Even though you only have one mile, you want to run a pretty consistent pace for most of the run. Keep a nice long stride throughout your run and remember to breathe.


Once you are nearing the end of the mile, you can push yourself. Depending on how much energy you have left, really push yourself to an all-out sprint.
Once you’ve crossed your finish line, cool down by continuing to jog for about a minute or so, slowing your pace until you’re at a comfortable walk.

Take time to warm up and stretch out.,
Employ interval training and plyometrics.,
Focus on time more than pace while jogging.,
Stick to your program.,
Vary your cardio training.,
Be patient but determined.",How to Run for Longer1," It can be tempting to just get on with the running part of running, but properly preparing your body will pay dividends in your results. A proper warm up can also reduce your chance for progress-derailing injuries, such as a pulled hamstring.


Warm up your muscles for 10-15 minutes before beginning your workout proper. Start by walking and gradually picking up the pace until you reach a full run.
If you choose to stretch before your workout, do it after your warmup, as stretching is more effective on loose muscles. Some advise eschewing stretching before the workout altogether, instead preferring to stretch for 5-10 minutes after the workout when muscles are at their most pliable.Stretch your hamstrings by lying on the ground and raising each leg straight up in the air. This is considered superior to standing toe-touches because it better isolates the hamstring. Hold for 10-30 seconds.
Stretch your quadriceps by pulling each leg up behind you while standing. Hold for 10-30 seconds.;
, Jogging for longer periods requires greater efficiency, in both your body's utilization of oxygen and your body's motion when your feet are on and off the ground. Specific types of training can improve the efficiency of each.


Interval training involves running at high speed for short bursts (often 30 seconds to one minute), interspersed with cool-downs of equivalent or slightly longer periods that consist of light jogging or walking. For more detail on an interval training regimen, see How to Increase Your Running Stamina

Interval training increases your VO2 max, which is essentially the efficiency in which your body uses oxygen to convert calories into energy.Improving this efficiency through more intense running will benefit your ability to keep up a lighter pace of running for longer times as well.
Plyometrics involves using drills such as jumping rope, skipping, one-legged hops, and high-knee sprints to improve explosive power in the legs so that your feet can spend less time in contact with the ground while running.Maximizing the propulsive power while minimizing the contact time (and thus friction) of each step is one key to more efficient running.

, Prioritize training your body to jog for a specified period of time -- a half-hour, hour, or whatever it may be -- before worrying about how much ground you cover in that time. The pace can be picked up further along in the training process.If you are a beginner and/or cannot jog for 30 minutes straight, take brief walking breaks as you go. Don't stop until you reach the 30-minute mark, to train your body to keep moving for that amount of time. Steadily wean yourself off the walking breaks.
Find a pace that you feel like you could keep up indefinitely once your training moves beyond the beginner stage.
Keeping an easy pace can reduce your risk of injury., Research various running programs and find one that suits your needs, be it an 8-week beginner plan with a weekly schedule,a 10% weekly increase in mileage,or pacing yourself on 800-meter runs to prepare for a marathon.Programs with a good deal of variety can help moderate injury risk while also combating the boredom that can come from doing the exact same training the exact same way over and again. Such tedium can make it easier to justify skipping one workout, then another, and so on.

, Jogging for longer periods of time requires increasing your cardiovascular endurance, but to break up the monotony and give your sore shins or other parts a break, switching between jogging and exercises like biking and swimming can be quite beneficial.


As a non-weight bearing exercise, swimming can give a break to sore feet, knees, etc., while providing an equivalent cardio workout. It also gives you a chance to exercise your upper body muscles.
Bicycling is also easier on the joints than running, and thus can make an effective change of pace. You can also do interval training on a bicycle, mixing bursts of speed with slowdowns just like you do while running.Consider rotating days, jogging one day then biking or swimming the next, especially if you are dealing with joint pain related to running.

, “Slow and steady wins the race,” according to the fabled tortoise, but it also describes the best way to build up your jogging endurance. Injuries are more likely to occur when pushing for results too quickly, and injuries can derail even the best laid training plans.Don’t expect immediate results or be frustrated when you can’t go from couch potato to marathon-ready in a few weeks. Remind yourself that you are in this for the long haul, and that every little gain benefits not only your endurance but your overall health.
That said, if you never push yourself, you’ll never move forward in your training. Push yourself to keep going and reach that day’s goal, even when you are sore, tired, or just want to quit. Unless you think you may be injured, you do need to push through some pain in order to gain.

"
Start small.,
Warm up for five to ten minutes before each run.,
Breathe deep, steady breaths.,
Be aware of your running form.,
Take comfortable strides.,
Relax your upper body, but hold your back straight.,
Let your arms swing in a controlled, compact movement.,
Stretch after running.,
Consider listening to music while you run.",How to Start Running1," Before you start running every day, you should establish a base level of fitness. Running is great for you, but it is physically punishing, and it can wreak havoc upon your body if you aren't ready. If you start running with no prior exercise habits, you risk hurting yourself before you get into the swing of a routine.


Consider starting with daily walks and progressing gradually into running. Consider hiking, swimming, or dancing--anything that gets you out the door and moving, regularly.;
, You should always do this--but it is especially crucial when you're first starting out, as your muscles are unused to the stress of running. Try dynamic stretches.


Traditional, static stretches (touch your toes and hold the pose) are most effective when they follow a period of activity. Save the static stretches for after you run.Dynamic stretches may include lunges, squats, high-knees, and deadlifts. The key here is to limber up and get your muscles working before you settle into a heavy run.

, Running is a highly aerobic exercise, and you will need to keep a constant flow of oxygen cycling through your body. Focus on each breath: in... out... in... out...


Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Nose-breathing is much more efficient than mouth-breathing, and you will find that you do not become so out-of-breath when you are taking measured breaths through your nose.
Breathe from your belly, not from your chest. Make a conscious effort to fill up your stomach with deep breaths. You'll be able to absorb more oxygen this way, and your muscles will be able to carry you further before they tire., Everyone's body is unique, and every runner has a slightly different gait. Start running and work out what feels right for you.


Pump your arms in compact swings. Keep them from swinging out of control, but do not tense them up.
Stand upright with a slight forward lean. Keep your back straight.
Pick your feet up high so that you don't trip over anything; but do not bounce off of the ground, as this transfers more force between your body and the ground. Try to land softly in order to reduce stress on your knees, ankles, and feet.

, When you begin to run, you will notice that you fall into a natural stride length. This may vary between sprinting, jogging, and running long-distance.


Notice your foot strike. When you run in place, you should land on the balls of your feet. This is how you were naturally supposed to run, so when you check your form, you want to either land on the balls of your foot or the middle.
In general, however: when you run faster, your foot will strike the ground further forward toward the toe.If you are regularly heel-striking, your strides may be too long.

, If you hold yourself completely stiff, you'll run more slowly. Keep your arms and shoulders loose, and keep your weight centered.


Keep your head and neck relaxed. When you try to control your head, the tension can extend down through your spine and the rest of your body. This can tire you out earlier than you'd tire otherwise.Instead of focusing on your upper body, try to focus on your stride. This will help you improve your technique and keep your mind off of your head, shoulders, and neck.

, This should feel natural--let them swing with your stride.

, Stretch all of your muscles, but focus especially on your legs. Stretch your calves, your quadriceps, your hamstrings, and your core. Breathe slowly and deeply and focus your attention on each muscle as you stretch it.


Stretching will loosen your tight muscles and lessen the risk of muscle cramps. It's important to stretch after any intense workout.
Stretch until you feel relaxed and loose. Try to stretch for at least five minutes.

, Running to a beat may keep you motivated. However, some runners contend that an artificial beat will keep you from running in the natural rhythm of your body, and that this can make your running less efficient.


If you listen to music, wear earbuds--nothing loose or bulky. Hook the earbuds up to an iPod, a smartphone, or any other digital audio device. Consider buying a strap or a holster to keep your device from coming loose with the impact of running. Otherwise, consider simply holding it in your hand for security.
Keep in mind that a steady stream of song will distract you from your surroundings. You may not hear cars, bicycles, or other pedestrians. If you run while listening to music, you will need to be more visually aware of your surroundings.
Some people prefer to run to slower songs, and some prefer a quicker tempo. Pick something that makes you excited to run.

"
Hit the weight room.,
Find the right training spot.,
Take time to warm up and stretch out.,
Establish good technique.,
Don’t try to max out from the beginning.,
Build up your speed endurance.",How to Run for Longer2," While weight training can benefit joggers seeking greater endurance as well, it is particularly beneficial to sprinters. Unlike jogging, sprinting requires short bursts of maximum effort from the muscles over your entire body.


Try to weight train a couple of times per week, perhaps on Tuesdays and Thursdays between sprint training sessions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for instance.
There is some truth to ""no pain, no gain."" You need to push yourself in order to build muscle; at the same time, though, don't risk injury by overexertion. Strive to build lean muscle, not to try out for the next ""World's Strongest Man"" competition.
Obviously you want to build up your leg muscles by way of squats, leg presses, and so on. However, you also want to strengthen your abdominal core and shoulders, as arm movement helps propel sprinters forward. Include exercises like sit-ups, leg lifts, and bench and shoulder presses to your workout., While jogging simply requires a treadmill, trail, or decent sidewalk, sprint training is more effective in more particular conditions.


A running track is the best option for sprint training, since it is flat, marked for distance, and more shock-absorbing for the runner. If a track is unavailable, seek a flat area at least 40 meters long.
A grass football or soccer field will be easier on your feet and shins especially, while pavement offers more even footing that might protect against ankle or knee sprains. Mix-and-match or find which works best for your body., As with distance running training, warm up by starting at a slow pace and steadily increasing to a fast run over several minutes.


Consider incorporating dynamic stretches after your warmup. Unlike traditional static stretches, dynamic stretches are done while in motion, such as while walking 20 meters or so. They include stretches like walking on the toes or lifting the knees as high as possible.
Dynamic stretching exercises come with names like “Frankensteins” and “Butt-Kickers,” so they obviously are meant to be intense. Done judiciously, for several minutes after warmup and before workout, they do seem to enhance sprinting performance.Do dynamic stretching carefully, as there is a greater risk of injury than with static stretching.

, Sprinting requires you to exert maximum energy, so you don’t want to waste any of it on flailing arms, improper steps, or increased wind resistance.Try running on the balls of your feet instead of your heels. Not everyone agrees that this technique is more natural or less likely to cause injury, but it does seem to be preferable for sprinting, since it reduces contact time between foot and ground (and thus friction).Don’t over-stride. It may feel like a longer stride gets you further ahead faster, but fewer steps means less propulsive power forward. The goal is to take shorter, quicker strides to maximize power and minimize resistance (ground friction and air resistance). Find a comfortable stride that doesn’t leave you lunging ahead or leaning forward over your feet.
Do try to lean slightly forward, however, as this will make your body more aerodynamic and less affected by wind resistance.
Use your arms as well, pumping each one forward and upward in concert with the same-side leg. Keep you elbows slightly bent and hands in a loosely-closed fist.
Make sure you keep breathing. People have a tendency to hold their breath when exerting themselves, which is not advisable when your body is starving for oxygen during a sprint. There are varying viewpoints on timing and frequency of breathing during a sprint, so the best advice is probably to find a breathing pattern that feels most natural for you., After warming up, don’t go straight into sprinting at full speed. Start at what feels like about 70% intensity, then go up to 80%, 90% and full intensity, so long as you do not feel discomfort that might indicate injury.


If you have a stopwatch, time out your sprints for 30 seconds. If you’re on a track with markers, go for 200 meters (half a lap). If you have neither, count out about 125 steps per sprint. You can increase these numbers as your training progresses.
Sprinting depletes the oxygen in your muscles, so it is important to rest between runs. Start out by trying to rest for 3 seconds per second of running (90 seconds after a 30 second sprint). You should rest until your breathing calms to the point where you could make conversation with a fellow runner. Take up to 4 minutes between sprints if necessary.Resting means walking, not sitting, however. Keep your muscles loose.

, Once you’ve established a solid routine of sprint training, you can begin to ramp up your ability to keep up a sprint over greater distances. As might be expected, the main methods are more sprinting time, less recovery time (if necessary), and more intensity.


Increase the time of your sprints from 30 seconds gradually up to 1 or even 2 minutes. Try adding 10-15 seconds per sprint per session, for instance. Gradually decrease the time between sprints to 90 seconds, if you typically take longer.Instead of walking to rest between sprints, try doing push-ups, sit-ups, or another strength-training exercise.Do more high-intensity sprinting exercises such as a shuttle run or pyramids. A shuttle run involves placing 7 markers at 5-meter intervals and sprinting to and from each in rapid succession.
A pyramid run involves placing 6 markers at 10-meter intervals (50 meters total), then sprinting to the first maker (10 m) and walking the rest (40 m), then running 20 m / walking 30 m, and so on until you run the full 50 meters back and forth. Rest for 90 seconds between sets of either shuttles or pyramids.Try hill sprinting. Find a hill that offers good footing and a manageable steepness, then follow the same procedures as level-ground sprinting. This will be more intense, however, so ramp up your intensity more slowly and allow a little more recovery time. Find steeper hills, go faster, and rest less as you progress."
"
Establish your goals.,
Assess your fitness level.,
Equip yourself properly.,
Adopt healthy habits.,
Set a schedule.,
Find motivation aids.",How to Run for Longer3," Be clear as to what you want to achieve by undertaking a running program. It it general fitness? Running in a race? Keeping up with your grandkids in the backyard?


Set benchmarks that you can “check off” along the way. For instance, jogging for 30 minutes straight, 45 minutes, and so on, or sprinting 40 yards, 60 yards, and up to 100 yards.
Having clearly-stated goals and benchmarks along the way can help keep you motivated to stick to the program.

, Especially if you are older, out of shape, or have underlying medical conditions, consult with a physician regarding your plans to undertake a running program. A realistic assessment of your current fitness level will help you craft an appropriate program.Don’t assume you are too old or too out of shape to run, however. Almost anyone can take on and benefit from a running -- or a run / walk -- program.

, Running gear is not overly expensive, and investing in the right equipment will make your workouts more efficient and your body less susceptible to injury.Choose running shoes, not cross trainers, basketball shoes, etc. Consider visiting a running store where you can be properly fitted for running shoes. Like a race car with bad tires, the performance of a runner with improper footwear will suffer.
Select lightweight, moisture wicking clothing that will keep you cool and dry in warm weather, and lightweight, breathable layers to keep you warm enough in colder weather. Don’t skimp on socks, either -- keep your feet cool and dry. Women will need a comfortable sports bra as well.

, To get the most out of a running program, you need to fuel your body properly and cut out unhealthy habits that will limit your progress.


Running burns a lot of calories, so you want to eat lots of high-energy foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains -- basically, the kinds of foods you should be eating more of anyway. Lean proteins like chicken, fish, beans, and lowfat yogurt are also good choices. You don’t need to change your diet to be a runner per se; you need to change it to be healthier.Drink lots of water. Hydrate your body before, during, and after workouts.
If you smoke, try to quit. This is a good idea no matter what, of course, but smoking damages the heart and lungs, which are essential for running.

, Make time for running beforehand instead of trying to squeeze it in each day or week. Each week, lay out a daily schedule for your running program, including the variations in your program, actual workout time, and warm up and cool down time.If you can visualize how each element of your program fits together, it may make it easier for you to internalize that each routine, each session, and each day are interconnected and important. Skipping a run may not be so easy to rationalize, then.

, You will likely begin your program with boundless enthusiasm and then feel it wane as you realize that it takes a long time to achieve results. Find out what helps you stay the course and fight to rise above the plateaus you will hit along the way.


Work with one or more partners. Experience the benefits of camaraderie, commiseration, competition, and good old-fashioned peer pressure. Training alongside another runner or a few may offer the pull or the push you need to keep going.
Visualize your goal while running. Picture yourself beating your younger brother at the beach sprint during your family vacation this year, or crossing the finish line at the half-marathon. Just stay aware enough that you don't run into something or someone.
Try listening to music. Does easy listening or heavy metal get you in the right frame of mind to run? Try different styles and see if any work best for you. But again, don't let music become a dangerous distraction.
Sign up for a charity run. The better your progress in training, the more good you will do on race day. Help yourself while helping others.

"
"
If you feel ready--go for a run today.,
Don't worry about the gear, at first.,
Warm up before you run and stretch after you run.,
Be aware of your surroundings.",How to Start Running2," No amount of reading will fully prepare you. You have plenty of time to buy gear and improve your technique, but the world's nicest pair of running shoes will take you nowhere if you don't start running.


You can run almost anywhere: down the sidewalk, through the park, around the track at a local school. Stay out of the street, when possible. You will be moving more quickly than the average pedestrian, and cars may not notice you so easily.
If you have a gym membership, consider running on the treadmill. This controlled environment may feel more comfortable at first.
The motion of running may feel uncomfortable at first. This is normal. You are putting tension on muscles that you don't normally use, and the practice of running itself will make these muscles stronger.

, When you're just starting out, you don't need a pair of fancy running shoes. Old sneakers will do. If you decide to make a serious practice of running, then you may want to consider buying running shoes.


Run in simple, comfortable clothes: gym shorts, a t-shirt, and a sports bra if necessary. Don't wear anything too heavy or constricting.
Wear socks. Your feet will sweat when you put them to work, and socks will keep your feet from chafing against your shoes.
Running barefoot can reduce the risk of injury to your foot, but only if you are running on a forgiving surface.If you live near the beach or a grassy area, consider running barefoot--but look out for broken glass and other sharp objects!

, Again: practice dynamic stretching during your warm-up, and save the static stretches for afterward.


Take 5-10 minutes before and after to loosen up your muscles. This will dramatically reduce the risk of cramps.
Dynamic stretches (i.e. lunges, deadlifts, squats) focus on movement; you are priming yourself for intense cardiovascular activity.
Static stretches (i.e. the butterfly stretch and some yoga poses) involve focusing on each muscle in turn and holding poses; you are loosening up muscles that have become tight through physical strain.

, If you are running at night, keep to well-lit areas. Do not stop for long, if you can avoid it, whether you are stopping to talk with a stranger or to tie your shoes. Tell a roommate or a family member where you will be running, and tell them when to expect you back.


If you are running during the day, look out for cars, bicyclists, and other pedestrians. Be constantly aware of your surroundings, and be prepared to change course at any time. You cannot always count on cars to stop for you.
Make yourself visible. If you will be running in an urban area amid a lot of car traffic, wear bright colors. This will help cars, buses, and bicyclists notice you when you cross busy streets.

"
"
Consider sprint training.,
Warm up.,
Run as fast as you can for about 30 seconds.,
Run faster by using your entire body.,
Take breaks.,
Sip water; don't gulp.,
After 15-20 minutes, cool down and stretch out.",How to Start Running3," Sprint training builds upon short, powerful bursts of speed punctuated by periods of rest. It is an excellent way to build muscle, burn calories, and raise your metabolic rate. If you are short on time and you like to run fast, you may want to try sprinting.


Sprinting is a useful skill for sports that require players to move quickly and powerfully with rests in between--football, for example, or baseball.
Sprinting is a leg-heavy workout. If you begin to sprint regularly, you may significantly bulk up your thighs and calves.

, If you're running around a track, take one lap at a walk and another at a jog. Limber up your muscles with dynamic stretches, preparing your mind and body for the oncoming sprints.


Again, don't stretch now--stretch later. Warm up your core muscles and your legs with dynamic core-building exercises like lunges and deadlifts.

, The length of your sprint is up to you: some prefer to sprint a specific distance, and some prefer to sprint for an allotted time. As a loose rule of thumb, try to keep your sprint to 30 seconds or less.


Sprinting is interval training--meaning intervals of speed and rest. After each sprint, rest (stand in place or walk slowly) for about a minute: roughly double the time for which you were sprinting. When you rest, stay on your feet.
Continue this cycle of run-and-rest for 15-20 minutes, or until you are ready to quit. Don't go too hard at first. Sprinting is intense, and you will wear out quickly until you've been at it persistently for a few weeks., Shifting your core too far forward can lead to injury, but in increments it may make you run slightly faster. Swinging your arms in loose, controlled bursts may amplify the movement of your legs.


Use your arms for momentum. Keep them in a straight line, mirroring the movement of your legs. Keep them loose and not hunched up to your shoulders.You may find that when you lean your core slightly forward, your body runs a bit faster to balance out your weight. This can be helpful when running uphill, but it can also lead to injury. Be careful, and take this method with a grain of salt.

, Avoid sitting down; walk slowly or keep standing. This will prepare your body for the next sprint by giving your lungs time to re-oxygenate.


If you experience chest, stomach, or leg pain, stretch out and stop sprinting for the day. Your body is telling you it should not be doing what you're making it do. Better to stop and sprint another day than to push yourself into an injury.

, If you need water between sprints, take small sips. Don't guzzle or gulp, even if you're very thirsty; drinking too much water in the middle of a run can cause painful stomach cramps.


It's very important to stay hydrated, especially if you're sprinting on a hot day. If you become dehydrated, you may become dizzy and faint. If you don't drink water during your run, make sure to drink plenty before and after.

, Gently work your muscles after your sprints to reduce the risk of cramping and shin splints. In addition to stretching, perform light versions of the dynamic warm-up stretches: a few light lunges, a few brief squats.


Walk around for a bit before you sit down. If you are on a treadmill, walk for another minute or so at a low speed.
Take deep, slow breaths and let your heart-rate return to normal.

"
"
Consider long-distance running.,
Get the right fit for your shoes.,
Start with a 30-minute run.,
Load up on carbohydrates.,
Consider eating energy goo (such as Gu gel or Clif Shots).,
Warm up.,
Pace yourself.,
Jog when you're tired.,
Stay hydrated.,
Cool down.",How to Start Running4," This type of training places the emphasis on endurance over speed. You will run more slowly over much longer distances--perhaps even a marathon.


Consider the muscles that you want to build. Long-distance runners tend to become lean and sleek, where sprinters are more powerful and compact.

, Make sure your running shoes fit your feet as close as they can without being too tight. If your shoes are too tight, you may develop blisters midway through a long run. The longer you run, the better your shoes need to be.


If you run every day, your shoes may only last as much as 4-6 months. If your feet begin to hurt whenever you put on your running shoes, it may be to get a new pair.
Some shoe stores can design shoes specifically for your feet. If you can afford it, consider getting shoes that match your arch and foot shape, as this will make your stride more natural.

, Run at 50-75% of your top speed to conserve energy. If you need a break, slow down to a slow jog. Do not stop.


If you live near a school, consider running around the track. Standard-size tracks are a quarter-mile long per lap. If you are completely new to running, start by running a mile. If you have been running for a while, you can build up to three, four, or even more miles.
If you live near a park or an open-space preserve, consider trail running. Be aware that hills and rough terrain will make it more difficult to run, especially at first.
If you have a gym membership, consider using the treadmill. A treadmill makes it easy to track your speed and the distance that you have run, and you may prefer to start out in a controlled environment.

, Carbohydrates are full of the energy that your body wi If you're planning to run a 10k (a 10-kilometer race; 6.2 miles) or something even longer, it's wise to eat high-carbohydrate foods a day or two before. You don't want too much fiber, protein, or fat, and your food should be easily digestible to avoid nausea during a race.


Tortillas, oatmeal, bread, pancakes, waffles, bagels, yogurt, and juice are all high-carb, easy-to-digest options.
Fruit contains plenty of carbohydrates, but many fruits are high in fiber, and fiber is not easily digestible. Peel the skin beforehand to keep your fiber levels down.Don't worry about the calorie count--calories are just energy, and when you run long-distance you will burn most of this energy long before it is stored as fat.

, The packets are filled with concentrated sugar and carbohydrates; they are also available in a chewable block form (Clif Shot Bloks). The formula replenishes your glucose sugar levels, and one packet should give you an energy burst about 20 minutes after you eat it.If you do decide to use energy goo, test it out while you are training--at least a week before a big race. You don't want stomach troubles during a long race.

, Walk briskly for 5 minutes before you start running. This will get your circulation going without expending too much energy prematurely. You want to prime your body for its impending feat of endurance.


Again, perform core-building exercises like lunges and squats. Warming up is essential whether you are sprinting or running long distances.

, If you start out too quickly, you'll tire quickly and you may have trouble finishing the run. Instead of running all out (like you would in a sprint), run at a pace you can keep steady. You'll last much, much longer.


Be aware of your limits. Build distance slowly, patiently, and you will find yourself improving.

, When you're feeling tired in the midst of a long run, try lowering your pace to a slow jog and building back up to running as soon as you can. Slowing down to a walk will break your flow and may drastically limit how much ground you cover.

, When you sweat, your body becomes dehydrated quickly, and it is of the utmost importance that you stay hydrated during a long run.


If you take water with you on your run, only drink small sips. Gulping down large amounts water in the middle of a run can cause cramps.
Keep your water cold, if you can. The colder it is, the more quickly it will be absorbed into your system., At the end of your run, downshift to a jog, then a walk. Breathe deeply and slowly. Your heart should be beating near its resting rate by the time you stop.


Take time to stretch and breathe. Ease out of the run.e You may cramp if you sit down immediately.

Relax your mind and let your legs work.",How to Survive a Shuttle Run," When it comes to the shuttle run, lateral—or side to side— speed is key. The side-standing long jump can help to increase your lateral power, which in turn will increase your lateral speed.Squat low, with your feet planted hip width apart. Jump to the right side by exploding off your feet and covering as much distance as possible. Do the exact same to the left side.Keep your center of gravity low, and maintain this low stance throughout the drill.
Distribute your weight evenly across your feet.
Do five repetitions on each side to complete one set. Do three to five sets.;
, You’ve probably seen this drill before, and maybe heard it called the “grapevine.” To do this, move sideways toward the right. Take normal side steps with your right foot, and alternate crossing your left foot in front of the right and then behind the right. Do this for a stretch to the right, and then for a stretch to the left, alternating your left foot to the front and back. Try to hold your arms in the same position you would hold them for a normal run.This drill will help you become comfortable quickly crossing your feet over each other for fast, explosive acceleration from side to side, which you will need during your shuttle run.Do five reps to each side for three to five sets.

, For a great shuttle run, you ultimately want strong, fast sprinting power. However, sprinting day in and day out can cause pulled muscles and injuries. By taking your sprints to the hills, your speed will naturally be slowed down despite doing the same amount of work. In other words, you can sprint as hard as you possibly can, thus improving your leg and cardiovascular strength, while protecting your legs with reduced speed and increased control.Keep your sprints short, generally between eight to ten seconds.Take a full recovery after each sprint.
Focus on standing tall as you sprint up the hill, rather than bending over and leaning into the hill.

, Shuttle runs have been criticized for causing twisted ankles, falls, and other injuries.While any athletic endeavor can potentially cause injury, doing side-standing long jumps, carioca drills, and hill sprints regularly can help prepare your body. These training techniques will increase your agility and strength, and they will help you develop the muscle memory and proper skills for the quick and explosive shuttle run.

, You might have heard of the concept “carbohydrate loading,” and it is something that many competitive runners do before a big race. Carbohydrates are a main source of energy for our body, so loading up on carbohydrates the night before your shuttle run is like filling your gas tank. This will help you avoid burning out in the middle of the sprints.Be careful not to go too far. It might be tempting to dive into a gigantic bowl of fettuccini alfredo in the name of athletic performance, but be careful not to overindulge. You can end up sabotaging yourself, and wake up with an upset stomach or feeling groggy and slowed down.Things like rice, peanut butter, potatoes, whole wheat pasta, whole wheat bread, and granola are excellent options for a pre-run dinner.

, The importance of properly hydrating the days before your shuttle run cannot be overstated, but don’t over hydrate. If you chug large amounts of water the day before the run, you risk throwing your body out of whack and actually feeling dehydrated on the day of your run.Remember to hydrate by keeping a bottle of water handy at all times. Sip it slowly but steadily.
If you don’t enjoy drinking water and have difficulty drinking enough, sip on sugar-free sports drinks or 100 percent fruit juice., This applies to resting your legs before the run, as well as getting enough sleep. While you want your legs to be rested and ready for your race, you also don’t want them to be rusty. In an ideal world, you can figure out what works best for you— maybe an intense workout followed by one day of rest is the best recipe, or maybe you need to do a low-intensity workout the night before. While you’re figuring out what exactly works best for you, just make sure you don’t overdo it the night before. If your energy is drained or your legs are sore on the day of your shuttle run, you probably won’t give your best performance.Try to get a full night’s sleep before you do your shuttle run. Sleep deprivation can hurt your performance. Everyone has different sleep requirements, but aim to get however many hours you know works best for you., The most important thing about your final meal before the run is to choose food that you have eaten before and know won’t upset your stomach. Bananas, toast, and oatmeal are all great options.Make sure you give your body enough time to digest, so that you aren’t running with an uncomfortably-full belly. In general, you shouldn’t be eating to the point of fullness on the day of your run at all— just eat enough to feel satisfied.

, By stopping your intake two hours before, you give your body enough time to process the water. You also give yourself time to use the restroom, which is important because running with a full bladder is not ideal or comfortable.Of course, you can take occasional sips of water as needed, just don’t chug a large bottle of water right before you hit the start line.

, When it comes to running, shoes are your most important (and only!) pieces of equipment. For a fast shuttle run, you’ll want to wear light weight shoes that will keep your steps light and quick.Make sure that you’ve trained in whichever shoes you decide to wear for your shuttle run, because you need to know beforehand if they are slippery, painful, or any other potential downfalls. Make sure your shoelaces are double-knotted and out of the way, because you will be rapidly changing directions during the shuttle run and don’t want to risk taking a spill!

, Rather than doing static stretches right before your shuttle run, move around to get your blood flowing. Jump, jog, bounce your shoulders, swing your arms, and keep yourself moving. Get your heart rate up and get oxygen flowing to your muscles, so that you are ready to take off when you get to the start line.This can also help you shake off any pre-run jitters.


Don’t disregard stretching completely. You can incorporate a few stretches into your warm-up, but just make sure you are moving around and actively engaging the muscles as well. You can focus on static stretches more after you complete the run and are cooling off.

, Instead of letting your nervousness overwhelm you before your run, think about using that energy to make your legs faster than ever. Having anxiety just means you are motivated to do well, so look at it as a positive thing. As you run, channel all of those doubts and concerns into your legs, using it to propel you through the run and to the finish line.


Don't let your nerves or anxiety cause you to be hard on yourself. Continuously tell yourself that you will give the best performance that you can give, but it is not a life or death situation. Positive self-talk can go a long way, so it's important to amp yourself up rather than expect the worst., Rather than thinking about how far you have to go, just think about making it to one line at a time. Look at the line you are running to. Is it really that far? You’ve probably run that distance before— maybe even dozens of times. Just get to that line, and don’t think about what will come next. Your mental and physical strength can and will surprise you, just focus on the immediate task at hand., These are calming breaths. They will help you conserve your energy, relax your muscles, and focus on the race in front of you.Try hard to keep your breathing steady, and focus on taking in as much air as possible. If you begin breathing rapidly, your breaths will be shallow and unhelpful. Deep breaths will deliver oxygen to your muscles more efficiently and help drive you toward the finish., When you think of completing a sprint drill, “relaxed” is probably not the first word that comes to mind. However, when your mind is relaxed, your body becomes relaxed. When you let go of physical tension, your legs become efficient running machines.Try to clear your mind before you begin your run. When you are at the start line, remember that you have prepared fully for this moment and there is nothing left to do but complete the run, which will be over before you know it.


As you run, focus on keeping your hands unclenched and your shoulders relaxed. As you relax your arms and shoulders, you will allow your energy and focus to go to your legs.
Repeat calming and empowering phrases in your head as you complete the shuttle run. This race will not break you, and the feeling of accomplishment afterwards will be worth any momentary discomfort.

Assume proper running posture.,
Stay hydrated.,
Warm up before running.,
Cool down and stretch when ending your run.,
Wear supportive shoes.",How to Stay Safe During Your Run1," Keep your head up and eyes forward. Your spine should be straight and your shoulders thrown back. Lean forward slightly to maintain balance as you run, but don’t hunch over. Keep your trunk stable and face forward. Keep your facial muscles and hands relaxed. Bend your arms about 90 degrees at the elbows and pump them in an alternating fashion as you run. Your hands should pass your body at roughly the level of your hips.Avoid bobbing your head or letting your head bounce from side to side. This wastes energy.
Ensure your toes point forward when you run. Avoid pointing your feet out toward the side at an angle, as many people do when they walk.
Maintaining proper form will help you run efficiently and minimize risk of injury.;
, Drinking water before you run will protect you against heat cramps, heatstroke, and heat-related exhaustion when running (or doing any vigorous exercise). This is doubly important when exercising in hot weather. On exceptionally hot days, bring water with you. You could just clutch a water bottle as you run, or invest in a hands-free hydration system like the CamelBak.
Signs of heat-related illness or overheating include nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and and irregular heartbeat. If you experience these or any other unusual physical activity, stop your run and head home to rehydrate.

, While it was once thought doing static stretches before exercise could help prevent injury, this has shown to be incorrect, and it may even impede your performance.Instead, focus on warming up with a walk, which warms up the muscles you will actually be using while you run, and include some dynamic stretches. A dynamic stretch might be to rotate your hips clockwise for 10 seconds, then switch direction and rotate counterclockwise for 10 seconds. Try warming up with some lunges, doing eight to 10 on each side.
Swing each leg forward and backwards as if it’s on a pendulum 10 times.
Try jogging backwards a few steps, or do some high knees and kick backs.

, As you get closer to home, slow your speed. Once you get home, slow all the way to a walk and spend five to 10 minutes walking around. This will help your muscles relax as you come out of the run.You can also incorporate some stretches to help you cool down and increase your flexibility., It is important you wear supportive, well-fitting shoes to avoid injury and pain from blisters and sore feet. Look for shoes with tread and breathable fabric. You can go to a sports store or a running store and the staff can help you choose the shoe that is best for your gait.


Replace your running shoes every 300 to 500 miles or sooner."
"
Use a starting block for sprints.,
Stand behind the block.,
Get onto the block after the first whistle.,
Lift your butt at the second whistle.,
Race at the sound of the gun.,
Get in position for longer races.,
Get ready on the first whistle.,
Run on the pistol.",How to Start a Race1," Blocks are encouraged for the 100m, 200m, and 400m races. Practice with them during training so you know how to use them for the race. If you've never used them before, read this article or talk to a track coach or teammate.

Do not use blocks when running 800m or farther. The starting position for longer races is covered later in this section.
;
, If you are using a starting block, stand behind it once you're satisfied with its position. This lets the starter know you are ready to begin.
, When the starter blows the first whistle, get in front of the block, get down on all fours, and back onto the block. Make sure your fingertips are almost touching the starting line, but not quite. Stay on your knees with your butt on your heels.

If you like, you can jump, shake your legs, or prepare as you prefer before stepping onto the block.


, This is your cue to get into the proper starting position. Lift your butt as high as you can. Do not make the mistake of raising your head; you should be looking down at your hands or the ground, not at the track ahead of you.
, After one or two seconds, the starter will fire the pistol and the race will be on. Novice sprinters will need some practice before they learn to go on the ""B of the bang,"" so to speak.
, If you are running an 800m race or longer, do not use blocks. Stand behind the start line in a running position, with your elbows at a 90º angle, your chin up, and your eyes looking at the horizon.
, Since there are no blocks, there is only one whistle before the pistol is fired. You should already be in the starting position, so the whistle is just a heads up to be mentally prepared.
, Unlike a sprint, it's important to pace yourself. If you are not the fastest person in the race, you should not be in the front. Pick a speed you can maintain for the whole race, so you do not slow down until you've crossed the finish line.

Stay on the sidewalk.,
Know your route.,
Keep away from abandoned areas.,
Don’t run in the rain.,
Protect your skin when running outdoors.,
Follow the rules.,
Be careful when running at night.",How to Stay Safe During Your Run2," The sidewalk is there for a reason. If you run in the road, you will be closer to passing vehicles, making it more likely that you will be injured in an auto accident. Sidewalks are set away from the road and therefore the safest place for runners.In some cases, you might have no choice but to run in the road – for instance, if the sidewalk ends or is under construction. In these cases, run against traffic as far as possible towards the curb or on the far edge of the shoulder. In other words, run in the traffic lane where you can see cars coming toward you and cars can see you coming toward them. That way, you’ll know how close a car is to the curb and be able to react appropriately., Don’t just run wherever your legs take you. Choose a route you’re familiar with. This way, you’ll know where all the best places to cross the street are, and be able to watch out for uneven areas of sidewalk.Of course, there’s nothing wrong with changing up your route once in a while. In fact, it’s a good idea to do so, since it will help you prevent getting bored with running and keep you more engaged in your run. But before trying a new route, map it out either on foot or in a car.

, Don’t run in or near overgrown meadows, or on streets with lots of abandoned homes. You are more likely to be victim of crime in or near areas with few other people around. Plus, if you are injured or become unwell, you will not be able to quickly and easily seek help from others if you’re isolated and alone., Running in the rain increases the likelihood of trips or slips. Rain also makes it more difficult for drivers to see you, and therefore increases the odds of being struck by a vehicle. Therefore, it’s best to avoid running in the rain.Even if you’re wearing reflective clothing in the rain, drivers might mistake your reflective clothing as a refraction from lights in raindrops.
If you’re on a run and it starts raining, head home immediately.
For similar reasons, avoid running in snow and fog.

, Even on overcast or cloudy days, up to 80% of UV rays penetrate the clouds.Make sure you apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen of at least SPF 30. Look for one that is water- or sweat-resistant. Wear a hat and sunglasses.


Try to avoid running when the sun is strongest, between 10am and 4pm.

, If you’re in a park or on a bike trail, there might be specific rules about how you can use the trail as a runner. For instance, you might be required to remain within a single lane and allow bikers to pass you in the other lane. Look for posted rules and carefully follow them., Wear reflective bands, caps, and vests to ensure others see you. Wear light-colored clothing, and strap on a headlamp to ensure you can always see ahead of you. Try to stick to a route that is very well-lit. "
"
Use caution when crossing the street.,
Don’t try to race a vehicle.,
Do not approach drivers.,
Don’t listen to music while running.",How to Stay Safe During Your Run3," Don’t assume vehicles can see you. Look both ways before crossing the street. Even if you have the right of way at a crosswalk, wait for vehicles to come to a full stop before heading across. Make eye contact with drivers and wait for them to acknowledge you. Drivers often acknowledge you with a hand wave.Sometimes drivers will not acknowledge you or wave you on. In this case, wait for the vehicle to pass before crossing the street, even if you have the crosswalk signal.

, If a car or bike is about to pass through the intersection, don’t try to beat it across the street. Likewise, if you see a train about to cross the tracks ahead of you, don’t try to race ahead to cross the tracks before the train makes it impossible for you to cross. Doing so might cause you to trip, or you might underestimate the speed of the car, train, or bike. This can lead to accidents and injury.Instead of racing ahead, wait patiently for the vehicle to pass in front of you. Even though you will have to wait, doing so will keep you and others safe.

, Even if a driver slows down and pulls alongside you, asking for directions or trying to otherwise engage you in conversation, keep your distance. If someone wishes you harm or wants to take advantage of you when you are tired and vulnerable, they might, for instance, encourage you to come closer before pulling a weapon on you., Using headphones or earbuds is okay if you’re running in the gym or at home on a treadmill. But if you’re running outside, you should not wear earbuds in order to hear what’s going on around you. If a car honks at you, for instance, you should be able to hear it.Instead of listening to your portable music device, listen to your environment. You might hear interesting animals or snatches of conversation at opportune moments. Staying alert to your surroundings will both enrich your running experience and keep you safe.If you must listen to a portable music device, put only one earbud in.

"
Always let someone know you’re headed out for a run.,
Run with a partner.,
Ignore verbal harassment.,
Pack the essentials.",How to Stay Safe During Your Run4," Even though you have your identification card with you in the event that you need emergency services, it’s a good idea to let your roommates or family know that you’re going out for a run and when you’ll be back. That way, if something happens and you don’t come back within a reasonable amount of time, they will know to contact the authorities.If nobody is around when you’re on your way out, shoot your friend or family a text, or leave them a quick note on the kitchen table so they’ll know where you are when they return home.

, Invite friends and family to accompany you on your runs. Not only is there safety in numbers, but it’s also a great opportunity for bonding with your friends and family.If you can’t run with others, or don’t have a route that keeps you within range of neighbors, try running at the gym or think about investing in a treadmill for you home.At the very least, run with your dog. Assuming you have a large dog with the endurance to run along with you, your dog can be a great companion and discourage would-be predators from harassing you.Stay alert and aware of your surroundings.

, When running, you might encounter smart-alecks who have nothing better to do than offer rude comments about the way you look or what you’re doing. If you have the misfortune of encountering individuals who verbally harass you, ignore them. If they follow you and continue to harass you, contact the police and let them know the situation., It’s a good idea to wear a fanny pack and put your phone inside just in case your route takes you away from people who can help you. You should also pack a whistle to attract attention if someone is attacking you. Bring pepper spray, too. Use your pepper spray if anyone tries to intercept or abduct you. Finally, carry an identification card with your name, phone number, and blood type. That way, if you’re injured and/or unconscious emergency personnel can provide appropriate medical care.Many people put the card with their essential information on it inside the sole of their running shoe."

Learn to pace yourself in advance.,
Warm up before the race.,
Position yourself with others at your skill level.,
Avoid congestion early in the race.,
Think about your pace after 30 seconds.,
Stay focused.",How to Start a Race2," Letting other runners determine your pace is a common mistake. If you try to overtake the other runners right out of the gate, you'll wear yourself out and hurt your finish. Finding your pace and learning your strengths and weaknesses has to happen during training, not when you're already racing:

Breathe in deep, calm breaths through your nose for as long as you can. Avoid short, sharp, shallow breathing as long as you can.

Find a stride that you can keep up comfortably for most of the race. Get used to the rhythm of this stride, learning the pattern of your strides and breaths.

Set a goal for yourself before you attend the race, based on this pace.


, Light jogging or other dynamic stretching is the way to go; static stretches will set you back by relaxing your muscles. Jog at a moderate pace for about 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}} to 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} mile (0.16–0.4 km), about half an hour before the race begins.
, Don't stand at the starting line unless you're aiming for a top result. New runners often feel intimidated if all the people nearby zoom right past them. If this is one of your first races, start further back and you'll realize there are people of all skill levels competing.
, You'll want to run as soon as the gun fires, but pay attention to the people around you. You may need to slow down for the person ahead of you before you can maneuver to a better position.
, This is a good tactic for new racers, who often lose their rhythm in the excitement. After 30 seconds, think about your rhythm, breathing, and any pain you're feeling. If you're pushing too hard, take it down a notch.

If you think you have the capacity, you can try to push yourself slightly harder than your regular pace, to get your (slightly painful) ""race pace."" It's easy to burn out this way without practice, so don't do this unless you're feeling very comfortable.


, Some runners say running is 10% physical and 90% mental. Stick to your goal pace, and don't let nerves cause you to run too fast or disrupt your rhythm.

If you're competing in a large race, don't worry about the people around you. They're all working on their own goals, and what they do or think doesn't affect your race.

Train for the race.,
Set a goal.,

Stretch and warmup.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Get a good start.,

Avoid common problems.",How to Sprint 100 Meters," In order to get in shape to compete in the 100m, you’ve got to do some general training beforehand. You need to improve your overall cardiovascular system and do a little endurance straining. Generally, you need to improve your overall athleticism. Consider:









Implementing a weight training regimen to get yourself in shape.
Run distance twice a week to improve your general cardio ability.
Make sure to rest 2-3 days in between runs.;
, You should set yourself a goal for the time you want to make on the 100m. Don’t set anything way too ambitious, you don’t need to make your mark as a world class athlete just yet. Set something reasonable and something that you would be proud of.









A good time for a top competitor is 10 seconds.
A good time for a very good high school runner is 12-13 seconds
Usually women are about 1 second slower than men.
A decent goal to start with might be 15 to 17 seconds., Running the 100m requires you starting in a certain stance so that you can propel yourself with maximum force and momentum forward. In order to do this, many coaches and professionals recommend and use foot blocks that are designed for your feet and legs to start in the best position to build momentum. When you get your foot blocks, practice your starting stance:


Your front foot will be about two feet from the starting line.
Your back foot will be at a toe-to-heel footing in relation to your front foot.
Your body will be leaning forward toward the starting line.
Your arms will be spread shoulder-length apart from each other.
Your hands will be touching the starting line with your index and thumb extended onto the line., Fundamentally, your starting stance and starting technique can cause you to win or lose the sprint. Not only is sprinting more intense, it demands the use of more muscle groups than running, and requires technique so that you can harness your energy and power forward on the field. You need to practice your technique, relying on your starting stance, so that you can build the most momentum going into the race. To start the 100m:


Your back leg, which starts off extended, will take the first quick step and come forward.
Your front leg will then quickly move forward and propel you forward.
Your hips will extend and catapult you upward and ahead., After you’ve done some work improving your general shape and set a goal for your 100m, you should begin running some practice sprints. Practicing sprinting will be the only way you’ll actually improve your score. But remember:









You should see some improvement after a week or so.
Run practice sprints 3 to 5 times a week.
Don’t over practice, your body needs time to rest.
Time yourself every time you run., Make sure you get a good night’s sleep before the race. Depending on your age and sex, you’ll need between 8 and 9 hours of sleep. After all, being well-rested for the race is fundamental to successfully competing and doing your best.


Go to sleep early, so you’ll have plenty of time to prepare the morning before the race.
Avoid drinking alcohol the night before. Drinking will interfere with your sleep, make you feel tired, and even hung over.
Don't oversleep or sleep too much. This might make you tired and groggy., While some professional athletes are cavalier about what they eat before a big race, you should eat a well-balanced meal the morning before your run. Don’t over eat, and don’t eat too many sweets or carbohydrates. After all, you want to make sure that your body has everything you need to power through the race without crashing.


A vegetable omelet might be a good option.
A bowl of cereal with fruit is a good option.
Have a glass of orange juice or cranberry juice with your meal., Before the race, you want to make sure you stretch and warmup. Stretching and warming up will relax your muscles and get your cardiovascular system humming. Without stretching and warming up, your body will be doing a “cold start” and you might lose precious seconds or cramp up suddenly.









Do a slow jog for 10-20 minutes before the sprint. But don’t wear yourself out, make sure there is plenty of time for you to recover before the sprint.
Stretch your hamstrings and calves. Whatever stretch you choose to do, do them for 10-30 seconds with 2-4 repetitions.
Stretch your feet and ankles. Whatever you do to stretch your feet and ankles, don’t overdo it. Make sure there is appropriate time before the race.
Some stretches include the standing toe touch, the butterfly stretch, the standing soleus, the achilles stretch, and the shin stretch., Water will keep you hydrated before the race. Nothing's worse than getting thirsty after 50m and having to slow down. To avoid this, drink plenty of water. Be careful not to drink too much; don't drink more than a bottle. You shouldn't be that thirsty anyway. After you've had a drink, wait about five minutes before running. If you don't, you could feel sick halfway through the race., The 100m is one of those events where the start often determines the finish. If everyone else shoots off and you stumble, you probably won't catch up. Getting a good start, then, will give you what you need to both finish decently and to get a good time.









Make sure that you get a good kick off of the starting blocks.
If you're not using blocks, spring off of your front foot.
Once you're moving, power with your arms and cut through the air. Do the same with your legs., Because you start with your back hunched, you will continue to run that way unless you straighten up. Not straightening up will both slow you down and might lead you to fall down and potentially hurt yourself. Make sure to:


Lift up your head about thirty to forty meters into the race. In other words, you should be straight before the second third of the track.
Don't look like a pole though, you'll create more air resistance that way.
Keep some form of streamlined shape, just not too streamlined., In the middle of the race (fifty to seventy-five metres), most people will start to lose their speed. This is because you spent too much of it getting a good start. To have an advantage over all the other runners, keep powering through. If you ever feel tired, look at the finish line. You'll see that it's really not that far away. Keep powering through all the way to the end, don't slow down until you've crossed the line. 







, To shave a tiny bit more time off of your final score, lunge towards the end. As you get better at running the 100m event, you'll get better at judging where and when to lunge. To do the lunge, wait until you've nearly crossed the line. With all the energy you have left, throw your chest towards the finish line. The judges usually stop the stopwatch when your chest passes the line, not head. That's why you want to throw it forward., There are a number of common issues that trouble many sprinters. If you work to remedy these problems, chances are you'll shave crucial seconds off your time and be a much better sprinter. Make sure to:









Work on your coordination. Oftentimes, many runners will begin to lose their coordination and control of their body as they reach their highest speeds after about 50 meters. Work to control your posture, keep your feet flat, and your shin perpendicular to the ground when it touches.
Make sure to harness your power and force in a focused manner after the start. Many runners have a problem keeping their running focused at the start of the sprint. Don't panic and just run feverishly -- stay focused on your upright form as you move forward.
Don't lunge too soon. If you lunge too soon, chances are you will fall short and lose precious time. The best way to avoid this common mistake is to just practice over and over again."
"
Hydrate as much, and as regularly, as possible.,
Eat a simple, low-fiber meal about 1-2 hours before running.,
Dress in light, breathable clothing, knowing your body temperature will soon rise.,
Start the first 5-10 minutes at a light pace, roughly a third of your top speed.,
Use a dynamic warm-up, not static stretching, to prepare your muscles for grueling distances.",How to Run for a Long Time1," Hydration's importance can't be stressed enough, as water keeps your strong, safe, and healthy. You should drink 4-8 ounces of water each hour at least two days before a race, along with electrolytes-rich foods like bananas and pretzels to help retain that water. One hour before running, gulp 16oz of water, and keep sipping before you leave.The best practice is to keep a water bottle with you all day, simply sipping throughout instead of trying to chug it down later. Constant hydration will do wonders for your stamina.;
, You want food that'll move through your body quickly and provide you with some lasting energy. Try toast with jelly and peanut butter, oatmeal with a bit of fruit, pasta with olive oil and lean chicken, or some granola and yogurt.You want a light mix of carbs, simple sugars, and a little bit of protein.
Avoid excessive dairy, greasy or fatty foods, and empty sugars found in candies and sweets.

, Over the course of a run, most people's bodies heat up 10-15 degrees, so assume it's about 10 degrees warmer outside, even if it means you must warm up while a little chilly. Try to avoid cotton shirts -- synthetics made for exercises are far more effective at staying dry and comfortable. Wet cotton is not only hot and sticky, it can get noticeably heavy.For races or big events, warm up in warm clothing, removing it once you have a light sweat going. This literally helps your muscles get warm, which makes them more pliable.

, Don't jump out the front door at top speed -- give you muscles some time to prepare themselves for the stress of a long run. A slow, light jog will lightly stretch and warm up your muscles, allowing you to gradually pick up speed.


Many runners like to jog for 5-10 minutes, then stop and stretch, allowing them to jump right into their normal running speed right as they start the clock.

, Studies show that the classic ""stretch and hold"" warm-up, performed on its own, can actually decrease muscle efficiency.Dynamic stretches, however, mimic real running more naturally to eliminate injuries and ensure peak performance. Try out at 30-60 seconds of the following exercises, using light stretching at the very end (10-15 seconds) to eliminate any soreness:


Lunges
Weightless squats
High knees and butt kickers
Skipping.
Side Shuffling
Running backwards"

Go easy on the junk food; stick with skim or 2% milk; drink a lot of water; eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. A well balanced diet helps keep you both healthy and fit.;
, As well as running, try other ways to keep fit, such as walking, swimming and cycling. You will get stronger and build up your endurance every day that you exercise.


Participate in sports such as soccer, baseball or basketball. Anything involving a lot of aerobic exercise will help.

, Before you begin any form of exercise or running, always warm up. This will tell your brain that you're about to do some serious exercise, and stretch your muscles so they can reach peak efficiency. A good warm up begins with stretching, and stretching your legs, for running, is most effective.

, Breathe in as deeply as you can through your nose and exhale in a controlled manner through your mouth.


Use your breath to help you pace yourself. For example: Take two short breaths in and two short puffs out. Try to help pace yourself by stopping to relax.

, Your body needs water to survive, and the amount you should be drinking is approximately 8 glasses per day. Before you start your run, have at least one of those glasses, and if you have a water bottle, fill it up and bring it with you for sipping along the way.

, When you're starting your run, just jog. Find your pace, and build up until you've reached your target heart rate. Once you do, you should be able to jog 400 meters easily without getting tired. When you finally do feel winded, slow down to a jog again, until your body feels better. Have a long cool drink of water to refresh, and don't stop until you've reached your goal. Once you can jog without getting tired, then add bit of speed. Don't go too fast.

, Once you get tired, don't let it stop you. However, if at any time you feel exhausted, immediately slow to a power walk. If you feel pain, you know you are over exerting.


Focus on improving your stamina; this will help you to go further.

, It makes you want to dance, right? It's the rhythm that's going to get you running, so use it to your advantage. Find the rhythms and melodies that give you energy, copy them to your iPhone, plug in those earbuds, and get going.


Listen to music with a steady beat to keep you running at a steady pace.
Imagine you're in a film, running to save the world; tune your music to match this and you'll feel great and you'll have so much more fun!

, Tell yourself that you can do this and will accomplish this by the end.


Think about your end goal, imagine the people who you are going to make proud when you complete your target.
Break your run down. If you're running a 10K, break in down into two 5K's, once you've completed one block, think ""I only have to do that again"".
Remember the good runs, remember how you felt when you had completed them; use this memory to pull you to the finish.
Count down the miles. You've just done one mile? That's one less mile to run now.

, Having company can be excellent motivation and inspiration. You can cheer one another on and compare notes after each run.

, As you are winding down your run, make the last 10-15 minutes a slowdown period, gradually slowing yourself to a walk. When your jogging session is over, do some cool down stretches and exercise. This will help your body not be as fatigued as it otherwise might be.

, Don't run every day or you'll wear yourself out, both physically, and mentally. Take a day off for relaxing, or working on your abs.

Choose the right shoes before you hit the track.,
Wear something you can move around in comfortably.",How to Sprint1," There are seemingly endless options when it comes to fitness footwear. For competitive sprinting, the most useful type of shoe is known as a “spike.” It looks like a regular running shoe with pins under the toe which help you gain traction and improve your speed. These shoes are lightweight so that you can sprint faster. If you're not planning on sprinting competitively you can safely wear other shoes for sprinting, such as:


Other types of running ""spikes."" There are spikes for long distance, middle distance, field events, and even cross-country running. If you already own a pair of these, they will do fine for recreational sprinting.
Lightweight training shoes or running shoes. Sometimes these are advertised as ""spikeless"" sprinting shoes. The important thing is that they are streamlined, with less bulk that will slow down your sprint time.
Regular running shoes. These tend to be a bit bulky. They won't hurt you, but they might slow down your sprint time. If you're just starting out, these shoes will do in a pinch.;
, If you're aiming for the fastest possible sprint time, wear something stretchy but form-fitting, like running pants. Otherwise, choose something breathable and comfortable.

"
"
Pump your arms.,
Don't lean forward at the waist.,
Take shorter strides.

,
Keep your head and eyes focused ahead.,
Keep your breathing controlled.

",How to Run Uphill1," On the forward swing, push your hand up six inches higher than it normally goes, which will help lift up your knees slightly and improve efficiency., You will lean forward into the hill slightly, but leaning too far forward will limit the upward mobility of your knees, inhibit your ability to push off the ground, and throw your center of gravity off balance.,, If you look down, you'll hunch over, reducing your lung capacity.

"
When you run track you should never be nervous when you're at the starting point.,
Put your thumb and your index finger right on the outsides of your shoe so that you can push off and try to gain a short boost.

,
Stay on the inside part of the lane because you're running a shorter distance.

,
Take the inside lane when you're running sprints because you can get the curb and go.

,
When you run the 20-meter dash you must stride the first hundred which is about 60%, and the other hundred you go full speed.

,
When you're doing distance runs like the 1600 you may want to take it easy on the first lap pick it up on the second lap and the last lap you pick up speed and the last 100 you sprint it in.

,
Talk to yourself while you're running.,
Think to yourself while you're running ""I'm going to win this race."",
Don't look around or behind you, but only to what's in front of you.

,
In a relay race make sure you guys communicate when exchanging the hand off with words like ""go"", ""stick"",""run"" etc.,
When you are running a race like the 400m you might want to stride the 300 meters and the last hundred give it your all.

,
Eat well.,
If you run in the 4x400 race you should stride the 200 and sprint the other 200.,
You should always breathe in through your nose so that you won't be out of breath so much and save your energy for another race.

,
You should always have water to stay hydrated.

,
Always keep your muscles warm when you are resting until your next race so that you're muscles are warm.

,
You walk around before a race because you're loosening up to keep from being stiff.

,
You should always practice before a race so that you get used to doing it on the actual track.

",How to Run Track," If you know you're good don't worry about it. You won't come in last.;

"
Aim for 50-60% of your top speed during the majority of the run.,
Stay on the balls of your feet to defy gravity and save energy.,
Aim for a stride rate of roughly 180 steps per minute, which you can easily calculate.,
Keep a relaxed but strong upper body to conserve and transfer energy efficiently.,
Keep drinking water, especially for runs longer than 30 minutes.,
Breathe in through your nose & mouth, then out your mouth, keeping a regular pattern.,
Eat a small snack, like an energy bar or energy gels, after roughly 45-60 minutes.,
Listen to your body's signals to stay safe on long, tiring runs.",How to Run for a Long Time2," Even if you feel great at the beginning, be sure to conserve your energy so that you don't get tired later. The more you run, the more comfortable you'll feel setting your own pace, knowing when you can push yourself and still have energy for later. In the first few runs, err on the safe side and conserve your energy until the end. You can always add another mile if you feel great and still want a challenge.


Music can be an effective way to keep pace. As you run, take note of songs that fit your gait comfortably, then make up a playlist when you get home full of similar songs.

, Try to place your feet on the ground for as little time as possible. A good way to remember this is to imagine pulling your plant foot backward almost as soon as it lands, really emphasizing the push-off motion to get maximum power and kicking the foot up towards your butt.To stay on the balls of your feet, land with your knee slightly bent, not locked.
Don't try and bounce up -- this just wastes energy needed to go forward. Push back with your landing foot, not down.
The last thing you want to do is land, stand you body up, then push off. Landing just behind the balls of your feet and pushing back to the toe smoothly will help avoid this., To find your stride rate, simply use a timer set to 1 minute and run, counting every time you right foot hits the ground. After a minute, double this number to find you stride rate. You should be between 175-185 strides per minute for the most efficient running. Too low and you're likely moving up and down too much with each step, too high and you need to stretch each stride out a little further.


Eight in ten runners have too big a stride, meaning their stride rate is too low. Try leaning forward slightly as you run to naturally shorten your stride.
Build up to a better stride, aiming to add 2-3 strides per minute each time you run.
Note that there will be some variability in body types -- smaller runners tend to have slightly higher stride counts., You want to keep your chin up and your shoulders back, with loose, relaxed arm and hand muscles. If anything, the only muscles you want to focus on keeping strong and tight are in your core, as this will naturally keep your posture strong and help efficiently channel energy. While you're not tensing your abs, you shouldn't be slouching or leaning back when you get tired, but straight up.


Don't neglect your abs and core while training. While not directly used or felt, they are key to running smoothly and efficiently during long distances., As soon as you're thirsty and your throat is dry, you've waited too long. The goal is to use water to stave off thirst, as this means you body has the water it needs to run efficiently. You can carry a water bottle with you, or, in certain areas, learn to plan your route around water fountains. Many running apps that use GPS will even map these out for you.


If you bring a water bottle, focus on taking lots of small sips instead of a few big gulps. This helps to avoid cramps and stay hydrated.

, Keeping your breathing calm and regular is easy if you just focus on this simple system. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. It takes some practice, but you'll feel the benefits almost instantly. The goal is to have calm, even breathing, avoiding short shallow breathes even when you're tired.


Keep your head up and chest out especially when tired -- it helps you suck in more vital oxygen.
Keep your breathing regular and patterned -- try to match it up with your stride if you're struggling., Your body is crushing calories every second you're running, and you will start to crash if you don't get some form of energy replace what is being lost. Like hydration, the goal is to stay ahead of this process instead of reacting to a sudden loss of energy. If you're running for an hour or less you shouldn't need a snack, but anything longer than this will require refueling to run effectively. Try out:


Sports beans and gels designed for running.
Half of a power or energy bar
Banana
Half of a peanut butter sandwich, This applies to both races and normal runs. You are you own best gauge of health and energy levels, so listen to your body when deciding the speed and length of the run. If your muscles are shaking, you feel dizzy/light-headed, or want to puke, move to the shade and get water immediately. If you're a little sore or breathing heavily, but can still move, try lowering the pace a bit and seeing if your energy comes back.


While setting plans and goals is smart, remember to be a little flexible. If you feel great, add another mile or so. If you're really struggling, try to get home and add more difficulty to the next run.
Being in a little pain is different than being sick or woozy. Know that, to truly get stronger, you need to learn to push yourself through some of the struggling sections."
"
Follow the ""easy-hard"" rule of elite runners to grow strength quickly.,
Use plyometric exercises to boost explosive power, maximizing each stride you take.,
Use sprint training to build the speed needed for long runs.,
Cut fats, excess sugar, and grease from your diet.,
Dedicate 2-3 days a week to focus on your abs, oblique, and core muscles.,
Trust your body as you train, always trying to challenge yourself in the last few minutes.",How to Run for a Long Time3," Many young runners aim for a roughly identical run each time -- challenging themselves about the same amount. But high-level runners tend to alternate very challenging runs with very easy ones, knowing that the truly challenging runs are where they make the most gains. A good way to start is to find 2 routes you love -- one easy and one hard, and then slowly add or subtract distance as you get stronger., While untrained runners believe they can just run to get better, strong runners know that specific strength training is key to staying fast and healthy. Plyometrics are exercises that require a burst of power, which translates into much stronger, more efficient strides when you run. Try out:


Box jumps, both single leg and double.
Shuttle runs
Squat leaps -- perform a squat without weight, then explode up and to one side.
Power skip -- see how high you can get on each leap, The top runners today train for sprints, even if they'll never actually use that speed in a race. That's because sprinting pushes your body to a degree that helps create huge training gains in a much shorter time. Some ideas include:



Intervals: Warm up for 5-10 minutes, then sprint for 30 seconds. Jog for a minute to relax, then sprint another 5-6 times. As you get better, cut the jogging portion to as close to 30 seconds as you can. Cool down for 5-10 minutes at the end.

Ladders: Warm up for 5-10 minutes, then sprint a lap at roughly 90% top speed. Jog a lap to recover. Then sprint 2 straight laps. Jog a lap to recover. Keep escalating until you can no longer push yourself, then cool down for 5-10 minutes., A strong, healthy diet will have long-term effects on your ability to run long distances. If you're always putting junk into the engine, like multiple desserts, fatty and fried foods, and empty calories like soda, you will have a much harder time efficiently turning that food into energy. While you don't have to be on an Olympian's diet, you can take some cues from them:


Keep your proteins lean -- fish, chicken, beans, whole wheat pasta, etc.
Make fruits and vegetables a large part of every meal.
Snack healthily -- using fruits, low-fat options like pretzels, and yogurts and granola instead of ""treats.""
Drink water all day long -- it will always help your body run more efficiently., As mentioned above, your core is the most essential set of muscles to keep an efficient, smooth, and relaxed posture while you run. This doesn't mean you need a shredded six-pack, but you should try out the following exercises. It doesn't take much -- try mixing and matching 2-3 of the following into a 10 minute work out, resting for 30 seconds between each exercise.


Sit-ups
Crunches
Side crunches
Planks
Side planks
Bridges, You'll only get better if you actually push yourself to your limits. Except on the easy runs, make sure you struggle at the end of all your runs. It is this ability to push through the struggle that will make you stronger, making future long runs much easier to pull off.


If you feel strong, pick up your pace for the last five minutes, giving yourself a good challenge to end the run on.
There is a difference between running through pain and running through a temporary struggle. If you feel sharp pain, wooziness, or sick, you should stop and get water.

Do dynamic stretches.,
Do some light jogging or running prior to your sprint.",How to Sprint2," Dynamic stretches are exercises that loosen your muscles while boosting your heart rate. You may have heard that stretching prior to exercising can be harmful; this piece of advice applies to static stretching, which involves elongating the muscle for an extended period of time. By choosing to do dynamic stretches, you lower the risk of inadvertently hurting yourself or decreasing your performance. Some examples of dynamic stretches are:


Hip circles. Standing with your hands on your hips and your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart, rotate your hips clockwise. After a few repetitions, rotate your hips counter-clockwise.
Leg swings. Stand next to a wall or fence for balance. With your right hand on the wall, swing your right leg backward and then forward for a few repetitions. Turn around and repeat with your left leg.
Half-squats. Stand up straight, then slowly bend at the knee until your thighs are parallel with the floor. You might want to stretch your arms out in front of you for balance. When your thighs are parallel to the floor (about ""halfway"" down), slowly press back up, keeping your back straight.

, Many runners find that sprinting is easier after they've already been exercising for a while. Since sprinting is often used as a last-minute boost of speed at the end of a long race, it can be helpful to practice sprinting after your muscles have warmed up considerably.

"
"
Choose a starting position (""ready"").,
Find your balance (""set"").,
Take off (""go!"").,
For the first 10 meters or so, aim to keep your body low to the ground.,
Between 10-20 meters, bring your torso to an upright position.,
By the time you pass the 30 meter line, you'll be running at full speed.",How to Sprint3," In general, you will want to begin a sprint crouched behind the starting line with your fingers on the ground and your legs positioned one behind the other. There are three types of starting positions: bullet or bunch starts, medium starts, and elongated starts. The type of start you choose depends on how far apart you want your legs to be when you begin your sprint. The best way to determine which starting position works best for you is to try each one several times. Regardless of your leg position, your arms should be about shoulder-width apart.


In a bunch start, the toes of your back foot are almost even with the heel of your front foot. Your legs will be very close together, making you look bunched up - hence the name, ""bunch start.""
In a medium start, the knee of your back leg is even with the heel of your front foot, putting more space between your legs.
In an elongated start, your back leg is stretched back considerably further than the heel of your front foot.

, Before taking off, lift your hips slightly in preparation for a burst of movement.

, In competitive sprinting, reaction time is crucial to achieving the best sprint time. Aim to launch from your ""set"" position instantly. It helps to have a timer close by or a friend to shout out an audible starting command; this is why they use a starting gun in competitive sprinting.

, You want your upper body to gradually rise from its starting position as your legs create the speed. It helps to look at the ground and concentrate on pumping your legs as quickly as possible.

, Try to do this as gradually as possible, creating a fluid motion that helps you accelerate.

, Maintain this speed until you reach the finish line.

"
"
Run uphill often.,
Do hill sprints.,
Do core work: plyometrics, pilates, yoga.

",How to Run Uphill2," For people who live in flat areas, look for stadium stairs, or use a treadmill on an incline.

, Run up a hill as fast as you can, walk down slowly. Repeat 5-10 times.

,"
"
Eat a good breakfast; not too heavy, not too light.,
Make sure to stretch properly before and after the run.

,
Take deep breaths.,
Start with a slow pace.,
If you have a stomach cramp, slow your pace to an easy jog and push your elbow into the area of pain for a few seconds.,
Will yourself on.,
Sprint at the end.",How to Run the Mile in Junior High," Try toast, milk, and a banana. Jog around the block or at a nearby park every now and then.;
,, You need to oxygenate your blood. Cramps are parts of your body that don't have enough oxygen so make sure to take deep breathes in from your nose and out from your mouth. Try to get into a breathing pattern to regulate your breathing, give you something to concentrate on and set a pulse.

, Get into a rhythm that works for you, try making a song out of it or a beat to keep you going (for example: thud thud thud breath breath etc.) Pace yourself. Don't sprint, then walk, sprint then walk, etc. This will lead to cramps. Keep a steady pace throughout the whole run and never stop.

, Do not stop, as this messes up your rhythm.

, You can do it! Make sure to be your physical best.

, You've got nothing to lose, it just improves your time a bit and could get you in front of that person who's been showing you their back for the entire jog. It will definitely be a push, but you're almost done, so you can cool down soon, and think that to yourself.

"
"
Dress appropriately.,
Cover up.,
Focus intently on excellent hydration practices.,
Check the temperature and the time of day.,
Recognize the signs of dehydration.,
Be prepared to stop exercising when you notice heat symptoms, fatigue, difficulty in breathing and other signs slowing your pace set in.",How to Run or Walk Outdoors in Hot Weather," It's important to wear running clothing that is both comfortable and able to wick away moisture from your body. If you sweat a lot, avoid wearing cotton as it'll just soak up the moisture and leave you with heavier clothing, which isn't conducive to your best performance. While there are many proprietary names for specialized fabrics that wick away moisture, such as Dri-Fit, Coolmax, Polypro, etc., they all fairly much perform the same way by wicking away moisture and drying fast. Wearing garments made from these items will tend to keep you cooler when running in hot weather.


In weather over 14ºC/60ºF and above, the ideal clothing for running is a tank top, tankini or singlet and shorts.For walking, a t-shirt or short- or long-sleeved shirt works too.
When choosing running or walking clothing, always try it on at the store first and check for padded or excess fabric that might result in rubbing when rubbing, uncomfortable seams or loose stitching. Walk around in the item before purchasing it.;
, Protecting your body against sun damage is vital. Focus on doing this both through clothing and sunscreen:


Wear a hat. Legionnaire hat styles are the best when made from fabric that grips close to your head. These protect your neck and the sides and front of your face from glaring sun. All the same, still add sunscreen to these areas. Whatever hat you choose, make sure that it stays on, either through its own elasticity or by means of a tie.
Wear sunglasses. Sunglasses that are suitable for running or walking are available and you can add on elastic or holders that keep the glasses in place. For walking, you may be able to wear your regular sunglasses unless they slip when walking a lot. Be sure that sunglasses wrap around to cover the sides of your eye area too.
Apply sunscreen to all exposed parts of your body. Do your research into suitable sunscreens––there is more advice available here.

, Purchase a good quality water bottle that has a carry sling or water pack that has back straps. It is important to take water when out running or walking, and the farther you intend on going, the more water you'll need.


Drink plenty before you go running or walking. Have around 500ml/17 fl oz of water about one to two hours before heading out for your exercise and and top this up with 250ml/8.45 fl oz 15 minutes before exercising.Don't use thirst as a monitor, not even in hot water. Drink regularly whether or not you feel thirsty. For example, on a long run, sip small amounts of water often. It's the only way to get the 800ml/27.05 fl oz of water your body needs per hour into your system comfortably and safely while exercising. During a run, aim to drink between 250ml to 350ml (8.45 fl oz to 11.8 fl oz) every 15 minutes.The hotter it is, the more you need to hydrate, especially when running. Re-hydrate at the end of your run, race or walk too.
What to drink? Water is generally fine for walking and for basic running. Sports drinks are considered to be more useful for serious running, as they replenish lost salts and sugars (fixing depleted glycogen stores quickly) as well as the liquid. There are isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic sports drinks available on the market. Do your own research into ingredients to see what matches your unique needs and preferences. However, it is recommended that the amount of carbs be between five and eight percent––any lower and the drink won't be useful, any higher and you're liable to a nasty sugar high which might cause diarrhea or worse.Know where refill areas for water are around your running or walking circuit. If you regularly include parks and other public spaces, drinking stations are often provided for the use of all.

, Both the temperature and the time of the day impact your ability to run or walk in hot weather. It tends to be more crucial for running because you're exerting so much energy to keep your pace but in either case, be sensible. Here are some tips to bear in mind:


Over 35ºC/95ºF atmosphere temperature, the human body loses its ability to release heat into the air, and any activity accelerates this process. In terms of core body temperature, the maximum body temperature recorded in a long-distance extreme runner who was still conscious was 41ºC/105.8ºF––by the time the body core temperature reaches 42.7ºC/109ºF, a runner will collapse.If left untreated, death can be sudden. The lesson is, don't go running or walking in temperatures over 35ºC/95ºF; wait until it cools down.
Note that while atmosphere temperature may be one reading, radiant heat from the ground, especially from such surfaces as bitumen and concrete can be up to 40 percent higher again.Following the sensible advice provided by all organizations concerned with sun safety, avoid running or walking outside for any length of time over 10 minutes when it's between 10am and 4pm. This is to avoid getting sunburned and risking skin damage and skin cancers. Stick to going out in the sun in the early morning or late evening, to avoid the intensity of the midday sun.

, If you aren't taking in enough fluid while running or walking in hot weather, you will start to notice some or all of the following effects and need to rehydrate and probably also stop exercising immediately (depending on the severity of your dehydration):Thirst: This is the initial stage of dehydration but it's not always evident as we learn ways to overlook this first indicator as a matter of convenience. Also, it shouldn't be relied on as the necessary sign to be concerned.
Dry mouth and reduced endurance: Dehydration is beginning to show itself.
Feeling discomfort everywhere: Your aerobic ability is impaired. Running or walking will seem much harder.
Your breathing and heart rate increase noticeably: When you start to find it hard to make decisions and find your pace dropping, your body temperature is rising.
Hot flushes, cardiovascular rates still rising: Once your body temperature starts rising to dangerous levels, you'll feel headaches, a loss of balance and dizziness.
Difficulty breathing, confusion, impaired vision, hallucinations, unable to swallow: All of these are signs of dangerous heat stress and maybe even heat stroke; your system is in danger of shutting down. You may suffer a blackout and you could die. Don't ever let things get this far.

, If you're running, slow to a walk or sit in shade if possible. If you're walking, sit in shade or find a nearby air-conditioned indoor space.

Promise yourself a reward if you make it to your finishing spot.,
One of the most effective techniques for running longer is to get a trainer.,
Patience and persistence.",How to Run Longer Without Giving Up," Maybe, if you know the trail you're running, you could pick a spot that's a little farther than you're used to. Or, if your goal is to run for a certain amount of time instead of a certain distance, run for another ten minutes. The point is to make sure to not torture yourself and stop running when you physically have absolutely no energy left.;
, If you think about the pain, it will only make the situation worse. Some people like to observe and comment on their surroundings to get their mind away from running. Others like to reflect on recent events that happened to them. Whatever you focus, don't focus on your pain. When you first try this, you might find that not focusing on your pain is hard. Ignoring pain is a skill that runners need to develop. Keep at it, and you'll get better eventually.

, ""If I finish this, I'll treat myself to a big ice cream"". ""If I finish, I won't have to run again until Wednesday."" Sometimes, the opposite can be just as effective. ""If I DON'T finish this, I'll have to do 50 sit-ups.""

Warm up before your run.,
Stick to a stable, soft running terrain.,
Begin by walking and work up to running.,
Stretch out your muscles after you run, like with the calf stretch.,
Alternate running with other cardiovascular activities.,
Change your running shoes out regularly.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Work to build a lean upper body.,
Consider getting shock-absorbing running shoes.,
Get a shoe that promotes stability if you have normal feet and ankles.,
Buy “motion control” shoes that are meant for over-pronated feet if you are dealing with this condition.,
Look for “cushion” shoes if you have a problem with supination.,
Keep the surface you will be running on in mind when buying your shoes.,
Make sure that your shoes are not too tight.,
Follow the RICE acronym to help heal your shin splints.,
Take NSAIDs to reduce pain and inflammation.,
Make sure you are getting enough calcium each day.,
Practice toe extensions.,
Give toe lifts a try.,
Do the toe and heel walk.",How to Run with Shin Splints," Never underestimate the importance of a good warm-up. It prepares the muscles and connective tissues (bone tissues included) for the incoming stress.


Routine stretching is no longer part of a sound warm-up. It should be done after an exercise. When your muscles are cold, stretching could actually lead to injury.Dynamic warm-ups should be done to prepare the muscles and bones better. Some examples of dynamic warm-ups are jumping jacks and light jogging in place.;
, Running on hard surfaces daily will pound the shin bone and cause shin splints again. Opt for runner friendly surfaces such as an indoor oval track with rubber matting instead.


Avoid uneven or rocky surfaces as well. Running in the sand or field can induce shin splints due to sudden changes in forces to the shin bone.

, Begin with walking first to ensure the strength of your legs and that it doesn’t trigger any kind of pain, then start jogging for a couple of minutes and gradually level up to running.


You can have days of walking first, then days of jogging sessions, then eventually running in short time intervals till you reach your previous training times.
Start with half of the distance you used to run in the past, with a gradual increase over three weeks.

, Stretching after vigorous activity promotes blood flow to the legs and augments the recovery period. The end result is a pair of well-rested legs that will respond better in the next running session.


The calf stretch is one of the best ways to cool down after a run. To do this exercise:

Stand in front of a wall. Put one leg in front of the other in a split stance.
The rear leg should be kept straight and the same foot kept in contact with the ground at all times. The front leg should be bent with that foot in contact with the ground, too.


Push your hands against the wall and bend the front leg further. You should feel a stretch in the calf muscles of the rear leg. Hold the position for 30 seconds.
Switch leg position and repeat.

, Rest your shin bone by alternating running with exercises such as swimming or biking. These exercises keep the heart rate up while letting the shin bone recover from excessive stress brought about by running.


Crosstraining is not only good for your shins, but it's good for your overall health, too. Instead of just working the same set of muscles over and over, you'll be training your entire body.

, Running fanatics who exercise almost daily must invest in new shoes every 6 months. Worn out shoes offer less cushion and support to the feet. When your shoes are weak, the shin bones take in more running-induced damage as a consequence.

, The secret to preventing shin splints recurrence is rest. The body needs it to recover from stressful forces induced by running. Though you may feel like it's detracting from your fitness, in truth it will return you to 100% faster.


Sleep alone will not provide complete recovery. A day or two of rest each week will help keep the bounce in your stride and prevent overuse injuries.

, A lean upper body reduces the amount of weight that the shin bone has to bear with each stride. These exercises will help you achieve a trim upper body fit for running:


The plank trains the core muscles to equally transmit forces to the lower body when running. This exercise also helps in reducing unwanted belly baggage that add burden to the shin bones. Read wikiHow's How to Perform the Plank Exercise for more information.
The bent-over row engages the back and core muscles. Both groups of muscles are important in maintaining proper running form that reduce load on the shin bone. See instructions on how to do a bent over row here.

, Choose a suitable kind of runner’s shoe which will support your feet and reduce the force going up to your shin area. You can buy specific shock-absorbing running shoes or use shock absorbing insoles to minimize the shock on your legs in case of shin splints.

, If you have normal feet or ankles, you need a shoe that gives you stability, which is why it’s called a “stability shoe.” This running shoe is designed with cushions and supporting materials with high quality to protect you from any foot injury while running or pronation of your feet.

, For over pronated feet, which may form the majority of shin splints cases, feet over pronation causes the ankles to bend inward a little, resulting in losing the normal arch in the feet. In this case, you need a special shoe to control the feet motion – a ""motion control"" shoe.This type of running shoe is specially designed and manufactured with additional supportive substances to increase the density of your shoe’s midsole (the running shoe is designed to have outsole, which is the outer layer touching the floor; the insole is the inner layer in contact with your foot; the midsole is the layer between the outsole and insole; the midsole layer is very important to absorb the shock coming out with each running step instead of your leg, and to give ultimate support and comfort to your feet.
In the case of over pronated feet, the increase in the midsole density in addition to bridges and roll bars can actually decrease the over pronation rate and avoid worsening of your condition while running.

, Another common condition is called supination, which causes the ankles to bend outward a little. For this case you need a shoe called a “cushion shoe.”


In this type of shoe, additional materials are added to the heel and upper foot areas to be able to disperse the shock absorbed between the two layers, the midsole and outsole. It also adds support and backing to your feet and ankles.

, Note that the surface you’re going to run on will affect your running shoe type:


Running on streets or asphalt will need light but high quality cushioning measures to minimize the great shock that can be transmitted to your leg through your foot as much as possible.
Running on trails will require other shoe types that can resist mud or rocks, and to be made with a waterproof quality.

, After choosing our running shoes, you have to ensure that the shoes are not too tight on your feet. The shoe fit must allow some space inside in width and length to give your foot and toes space. If there isn't enough room, you will find your toes being bent or squeezed while running, especially if you are a downhill runner.


More attention has to be paid if you use additional insoles within your shoes, as they will occupy more space of their own and you will find no space for your feet! Make sure to put your insoles in while trying your new running shoes and before making the decision of your proper fit.

,


“R” is for rest. The patient must not perform any kind of sports or activities that put additional pressure on the leg. This will aim in recovering more quickly and minimize the inflammation. If an athlete ignores these minor precautions he can worsen his condition and prolong the healing process.
“I” is for ice. Ice is applied to reduce the inflammation process, which in turn will reduce the swelling and pain. Ice can cause vasodilation of the blood vessels, which minimizes the amount of blood reaching the affected area. This will result in inhibiting the leakage of fluids to the outside of cells, reducing the pressure on the surrounded soft tissues and tendons, and decreasing the pain.
Ice should never be applied directly to skin, but should be wrapped in a towel or cloth. If you don’t find ice packs in the house you can use frozen beans instead. Ice should be applied for fifteen minutes every four hours during the first three days.
“C” is for compression. Applying a tiny amount of pressure to your shin will help in reducing the pain and ease the inflammation. This can be done by making shin splint taping to add additional support to your muscles.
“E” is for elevation. It is helpful for reducing the inflammation to raise your leg on a chair in front of you using a pillow or cushion below your heel.

, Ibuprofen is probably the most common NSAID, or painkiller, used. Follow the directions on the label or the directions of your doctor to know the appropriate dosage for you.


However, NSAIDs may produce some side effects such as gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, vomiting, peptic or gastric ulcers, patients with hepatic, renal failure or taking blood thinners as Warfarin should ask their doctor first before having any of these drugs.

, The recommended daily intake of calcium intake is 1000mg/day to keep the shin bones strong and sturdy.You can shoot for the daily requirement with 2 glasses of skim or low-fat milk daily and a serving of other dairy products.


Those who cannot tolerate milk can opt for calcium tablet supplementation. Talk to your doctor about taking supplements as they are not recommended for everyone.

, To strengthen your shins, you can do toe extensions. Here's how:Stand with your back straight and your heels on the floor with your shoulders back.
Raise your body up depending or standing on your toes
Return back to the ground and repeat for several times.

This exercise can increase in its severity by using a box or a ladder to stand on.



, To do this strengthening exercise:


Stand with your back straight and your heels on the floor with your shoulders in line.
Raise your toes up without moving your feet, then lower them down.
Repeat several times. You can increase the strength of the exercise by putting some weight on your toes to give a sort of resistance while lifting them up.

, A similar strengthening exercise is the toe and heel walk. Here's how it's done:Stand with your back straight and raise your body on your toes.
Take several steps on your toes.
After finishing, stand on your heels and then take several steps on them.
Alternatively, you can walk taking a step standing on your heel, then raise your body to be on the toes, then repeat with the other step until making several steps for about five minutes.

Before race day, train with your relay team.,
Figure out who's running during each part of the relay.,
Warm up and stretch if you haven't already.

,
Go to the part of the track where you will begin your leg of the relay.

,
If you are starting the relay, simply relax and wait for the gun to go off.,
When it comes time to hand off the relay, if you are the one handing it off, put your arm out at a 90 degree angle to your body with your arm outstretched and palm pointing down.,
If you are receiving the baton, start running a little right before you get it, while staying in the hand-off zone and look back to see when you get it.,
The person receiving the hand-off should take the baton in the hand opposite the hand in which their teammate is carrying it.,
Know the event.,


,
When it seems like its all over, and the other team is definitely going to win, keep pushing yourself.",How to Run the Relay in Track," Practice hand-offs and work out together on a regular basis. More than any other event in track, relay teams will benefit from a sense of teamwork and camaraderie.;
, Your coach will probably assign each of you to one part of it anyway, but just make sure this happens some time before the race so you can focus on your part when it's close to race time.

,,, If you are running another leg, wait, but stay loose and relaxed.

, Look toward the approaching runner and start to run as he or she approaches. Let the approaching runner bring the baton up into your hand between your thumb and forefinger. Grasp the baton and pull it from the approaching runner's hand. It is best if all runners agree ahead of time which hand they will carry the baton in. For example, it is best if all the runners run with the baton in their right hand, and all the receiving runners receive it with their left hand. The runners then transfer the baton from their left hand to their right as they run their leg of the relay. Don't hold on too tightly at this point though.

, Have your arm outstretched toward the approaching runner with your fingers extended and your palm down. When you feel it in your hand, grip it tightly and take off. If it is a short distance, you may not be able to look back during the hand-off. Hand-offs are especially important in sprint relays, where fractions of a second will win or lose a race, and ""blind hand-offs"" can be extremely difficult without practice, so make sure you know what you're doing!

, In other words, if your teammate is carrying it in his or her right hand, you should take it in your left, and then switch it to your right if you prefer to carry it in that hand. A right-hand-to-right-hand or left-to-left hand-off can lead to getting your ankles stepped on by your incoming teammate.

, How fast you run depends on the relay you're running. If you're running the 1600 meter leg of the distance medley, you're going to want to keep a pace, but if you're in the 200 meter leg of the sprint medley, don't hold back!,, You never know they might get disqualified or drop the baton. And it will help you run a better time.

Know your fitness level.,
Be realistic.,
Create specific goals.,
Set a deadline.",How to Set a Long‐Term Running Goal1," Before you set any long terms goals or make any major running plans, you should evaluate your current fitness level. If you are new to running, you should do a baseline test by running or walking your fastest mile. This will help you evaluate how in shape you are and give you a reasonable first benchmark to beat as your move forward.If you have any health issues, it might also be a good idea to consult with your doctor before you begin any new workout routines.
Do not set your baseline while running on a treadmill unless your goal is to run a certain time on a treadmill. If you intend to run outside, make sure that you run your baseline outside.;
, With an understanding of your fitness level, set goals that you will be able to meet realistically. The easiest way to get discouraged is by setting goals that are outside the realm of possibility and that you will never meet. Start with running objectives that are not that much beyond what you are currently capable and, as you improve, set new goals.For example, if you are new to running, you will likely not be able to run a half-marathon or a marathon after only a few months of training. In reality, it will likely take at least a year of training before you are ready to run a longer race.
If you are an established runner, keep in mind that improving your times does not happen quickly. Improving your times is a gradual process. It may take months and multiple races before you shave minutes off your times.

, It is important that you create detailed goals that give you clear objectives to reach. Vague goals like “start running” or “run faster” will not inspire you or keep you motivated. Instead, you need concrete goals that you can measure.For example, if you are new to running, you can set a long-term goal of running in the local half-marathon a year from now.
If you are an experienced runner, you might set a goal to improve your personal best time by 5 minutes.

, This will help you stay accountable to yourself and keep you motivated. Pick specific benchmarks that you would like to meet in the future and set specific dates for them. Open-ended goals are easier to put off and fail to create a motivating sense of urgency.For example, you could set a long-term goal of running a half-marathon in 2 hours and 30 after training for exactly one year.
You can put extra pressure on yourself by signing up for races ahead of time. This will give you a solid deadline and place some pressure on your to run.

"
"
Focus on the immediate objective.,
Create a routine.,
Invest in good gear.,
Track your progress.,
Get a running buddy.",How to Set a Long‐Term Running Goal2," In order to maintain your motivation, try to take your long-term goal and break it down into smaller goals. Focus on meeting your daily running objective and do not concern yourself with the larger goal down the road. Initially, focusing on the larger goal can leave your feeling discouraged, which can sap your motivation.For example, instead of fixating on the fact that you want to run a marathon in a year, just concentrate on completing your workouts each day.

, As you train, develop a consistent running routine. If you are preparing for a half of full marathon, you may want to subscribe to a specific training regimen, which will help you build a routine. Having a scheduled and regular running regimen will help you prepare and keep you motivated to meet your goal.There are multiple running training regimens online. Find one that works for you., Shoes that hurt your feet or clothes that chafe are going to sap your enthusiasm to keep running. However, comfortable shoes and appropriate clothing can mitigate some of the discomforts that come with running. Having the right running equipment will make a huge difference when it comes to staying motivated.


If you are unsure on what gear you may need, visit your local running or sporting goods store. A sales representative should be able to help you find the products that will work for you.

, Using a running application, a calendar, or a journal, you should keep track of your daily accomplishments. Logging your progress will help you stay positive and keep you motivated. Seeing how far you have come will also keep you accountable and prevent you from slacking off later on.Fitbit and Strava are great mobile apps for helping you track your runs.

, Finding someone to run with your or joining a running group will help keep you on target. Running with other people will keep you accountable. Sharing a goal with someone else will also bring you closer together and make the entire process more enjoyable."

Set a date to start running.,
Build your base.,
Increase your speed marginally after six months.,
Double your production after nine months.,
Participate in the next race down at ten months.,
Run a race in one year.",How to Set a Long‐Term Running Goal3," The first step in setting a long-term running goal is to pick a start running date. This is particularly important if you have limited running experience. Once you have determined to start a long-term running goal, pick a date in the near future to start running.Ideally, this goal should be within a few months of the present. If it is too far off, it is easier to put off starting. Take advantage of any motivation you currently have and start as soon as possible.

, If you are new to running, give yourself one to three months to build your running base. Start with at least three runs a week and gradually build up your endurance. Each week, speed up or lengthen your runs slightly. Be sure to take it easy. Pushing yourself too hard can lead to injury and burnout.Focus on meeting your weekly goal and do not get overly concerned about your long-term objective.
After a few months, you should be running five times a week.

, After you have built a base and feel comfortable running long distances, start pushing your pace. Speed up your runs and try to push yourself for intense spurts. Incorporate some interval training where you run sprints at your mile pace for about 30 seconds before slowing back down. This will help you build your endurance and increase your pace.Depending on your comfort level, you might consider inserting one speed run into your weekly running schedule after the first or second month. Around month two or three, you might consider doing two speed runs a week.
Use a fitness tracker, like a Fitbit, or a stopwatch to monitor your pace and track your intervals.

, Around nine months, you might consider substantially increasing your distance. Add a mile to a couple of your weekly runs, doing this for three to four weeks. Once that feels comfortable, do it again. Building your endurance in this way will prepare your muscles, joints, and bones to adapt to more intense runs.As you are building your endurance, slow your pace a little and run on soft surfaces as often as you can. During this stage, you are more susceptible to injury. Be sure to listen to your body and try to limit any wear and tear.

, In order to test out your fitness and preparation, run the next race below your target race at ten months. Run a 10K if you intend to run a half marathon and run a half if you intend to run a full marathon. This will allow you to test out how your body will handle all of the various stresses that a longer run entails.This is a great opportunity to test out your race-day outfit, fueling strategy, and pacing strategy.

, Most new runners will be ready to run a half or full marathon after a year of proper training. Ideally, you will have already run a shorter race to test out your running strategy. You do not want your long-term goal to be ruined because of a clothing or gastrointestinal problem.In order to stay healthy, you should only run one marathon a year and shorter races every six weeks.

Gradually build up your distances each time you run.,
Enter some races!,
Keep at it!",How to Run Long Distances," Have a power bar or banana at least half an hour before your run so that you will be adequately fueled throughout the run. Afterwards, eat a good meal to help you recover from the workout. Make sure you hydrate well before your run -- guzzling large amounts of water right before you start won't help hydrate you throughout a long run; in fact doing that might give you painful running cramps.;
, Decide what distance you want to run and where you want to go. Consider factors like hills and running surface when planning your route. Hills tend to be harder to run.

, Wear light weight running shoes that are in good condition and fit your feet well. Wear cool, comfortable clothes that will wick sweat while you run.

,, Focus on the legs, but also stretch your arms, back, and core.

, Try to run the whole way at a consistent pace. If you need to, walk for a few minutes before running again, but don't stop. Pay attention to your form: make sure not to be tense in the upper body, as this will tire you out much faster. Also make sure to run from the middle of the foot to the toe (land on the ball of your foot and lift off from the toes).

, Breathing is important in running long distances and learning how to breathe while running can help tremendously.

, Stretch well to minimize soreness after the run.

, This will help condition your body and get yourself used to running. This will be hard at first, but you will get stronger and start to feel more comfortable running.

, If you have never run before start at 1 kilometer (0.62 mi). When you can comfortably run that, try to go a little farther. Gradually increase to 5 kilometers (3.1 mi), then 10 kilometers (6.2 mi). Continue to push yourself until you achieve your distance goal.

, If you are in Junior High or High School join the track and cross country team, or join a local running club and enter races in your town or city. Try to get a personal best each time you do a race.

, Distance running is very difficult and not many people keep it up. But you can! People will really admire you for keeping at it, and you will be happier and healthier throughout your life.

, Before you step up to the starting line, Drink a lot of water. If you run with your water bottle, still do this. If you don't like to carry a water bottle with you when you run, then drink a bunch of water, because this will be your only drink until you finish the race.

, If you don't know the course, it might cost you. Before the race, jog the course lightly to get a feeling of the trail and know where to run in the real race. Many runners say knowing the course is not that important, because there will always be someone in front of you. Even if you're in 1st place, a trail guide is usually always there running ahead of you, leading the way. But that's not the point. The point is, if you are running, there might possibly be a big gap in between you and other runners. You may not be able to see anyone in front of or behind you. That is why you have to know the course before you run it. This is very important to being a good long distance runner.

, At the starting line, be prepared to take off running. You don't want a late start in a race, but keep in mind you don't want to run before the start of the race. If you take off running before the gun,(Or whatever signals you to start) the race will most likely be restarted. Keep your eyes and ears open at the start line.

, Many people ask the question of how hard you should run at the start of a race. The answer is, don't full out sprint. It may seem cool to you when you are 1st place in the beginning, but it's the end of the race that matters, not the beginning. Don't get off too slow either. Take a running pace, not jogging, not sprinting, but right in between the two. Keep in mind, jogging is for later on in the race.

, Throughout your run reassure yourself if you are nervous that you will do okay, and that the race is not about what place you get, but about having fun. It's okay too if you don't get 1st place every time. Truth be told, most runners don't.

, Jogging is a great way to keep your pace. Most runners jog in the middle of the race. Jogging at the beginning will give you a terribly slow start, and jogging at the end will tell everyone that you are not giving it your all. Know when you should jog, and know when you should not jog.

, When you are running on a trail, especially a narrow trail, always run in the center. Running in the center not only is easier on your feet, but also makes it hard for other runners to pass you. If on a track, always go to the inside of the track. It provides a much shorter route.

, When running, don't try to change automatically from lightly jogging to full out sprinting.

, When in a race, never walk. Walking shows your competitors that you are too tired to run and that you won't put up any fight when they attempt to pass you. If you really are exhausted, jog really lightly. Even that is faster than walking and requires nearly the same amount of effort.

, when you come to the home stretch or the end of the race, sprint to the finish. Even if you are tired, remind yourself that it's not that much further to the finish. You're almost there.

, When you finish (hope your race was a good one) drink lots of water. After a race you should be thirsty from all your running. You know you have run a good race when after the race, you are tired, thirsty and hungry. After you refill with water, your body will thank you.

Find the time of day that works best for your body and gradually add distance and speed.;
, Make a playlist that has varied music that can help you know when to speed up and when to jog. Interval training that transitions between fast sprints and recovery jogs helps to build speed over time. Mix a few of your favorite techno or hard rock songs in with some hip hop or country and create a pump-up mix that will get your legs moving in no time.

, If you've always listened to music while exercising, try ditching the iPod for awhile and see how that makes your body feel.


Some people can increase their running distance by not being restricted by the length or tempo of their playlist.
Running without music allows you to focus on your breath and listen to the sound of your body working.

, Put on a running outfit that makes you feel energized and swift. While some people actually enjoy the heavy feel of a sweatshirt that makes them sweat it out, others prefer lightweight shorts and sweat-reducing material. Wear the clothing that you feel most comfortable in.

, Running shoes come in very specific fits that are tailored to the length and width of your foot and are made for specific types of running. You can injure your feet by wearing improper footwear, so make sure to get your feet fitted by a specialist.


Road running shoes should be worn on concrete and other hard, man-made surfaces.
Trail running shoes should be worn for off-road running on dirt trails, sandy beaches, and rocky or muddy paths.
Know if you have a high-arch, a normal arch, or a flat foot. The arch of your foot will determine how your foot moves as you run.
If your foot hits the ground equally, choose a neutral shoe. If you over-pronate your foot by rolling inward too much, choose a shoe for stability or motion control. If you supinate your foot by rolling outward too much, choose a shoe with a lot of cushioning and flexibility., Slowly jog half of a mile before stretching. Doing so allows you to warm up your joints and muscles before you stretch them, thus preventing injury. Be sure to perform dynamic stretches that include motion such as:


Leg lifts. Swing one leg out to the side as far as you can swing it, and then swing it back across your body in front of your standing leg, as far as possible. Repeat this stretch ten times on each leg.
Cheerleader Kicks. Keep your back and knees straight, and walking forward, lift your legs straight out in front in an exaggerated march, and flex your toes towards you.
Butt kicks. Perform an exaggerated running-in-place motion while standing to loosen up your knees, hamstrings, and quads.
Walking lunges. Squat into a wide lunge with one foot dramatically out in front of the other, and continue to switch between legs as you slowly progress forward.
Shoulder stretches. Don't forget to stretch your torso and shoulders to prevent cramping during your run. You use your arms to propel you forward when you sprint, so you'll need to be loose and limber. Pull one arm straight across your chest and hug it in with the forearm of your other arm. Switch sides and stretch the other arm.

, Use a stopwatch to log yourself for various mileages in order to track your progress.

, Incorporate hills into your runs two to three times per week to push your boundaries and condition your body. Try following this example weekly routine:



Day 1: 10-20-10. Jog for 10 minutes, run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), and then jog for another 10 minutes.

Day 2: Sprint training. Head to a track and practice sprints. Jog 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km), then run another mile, sprinting the straightaways and jogging the turns. Start out with just the mile and a half, and gradually increase your distance.

Day 3: Rest.

Day 4: Long 60-90 minute run. Run at a pace that is comfortable enough to keep going.

Day 5: 10-20-10. Jog for 10 minutes, run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), and then jog for another 10 minutes.

Day 6: Rest.

Day 7: Sprint training. Head to a track and practice sprints. Jog 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km), then run another mile, sprinting the straightaways and jogging the turns. Start out with just the mile and a half, and gradually increase your distance.

, Being patient with yourself is one of the most important aspects of building endurance. Avoid pushing yourself to run too far until you have become comfortable with a gradual distance increase. Basically, don't try to run six miles right off the bat. Start out with one mile, then build up to a mile and a half, then two miles, etc.

, Don't try to sprint out a five-mile run, you'll exhaust (and maybe even injure) yourself. Start off with a light jog and gradually build up your speed as you run.

, Your breath can have a huge impact on your ability to run long distances. Make sure you are breathing in and out of your nose, or in through your nose and out through your mouth, depending on your preference. A steady breath means a steady heart rate and a higher lung capacity.

, You want to run with the same poise that you walk. Don't hunch or bend your back as you run, keep your spine as straight as possible.

, Plantar flexion occurs when you push off the ground by flexing your ankle joint. Dorsiflexion is the process of pulling your knee up off of the ground at a 90-degree angle. This reloads your ankle for forward push-off.

, The hip flexor and lower back must flex as you run to hold your back straight and support forward motion. Make sure you are cycling the legs forward, not recovering the legs behind your body.

, As you run, alternate driving your elbows back and forward in an exaggerated motion. As your elbow drives back, your opposite knee should lift up. Your elbows should also be bent at about 90-degree angles.

, The longer your stride, the more effective your forward motions will be. To create longer strides, use your legs to push rather than pull you forward. This means the bulk of the power when you run should come from whichever leg is behind during the push-off.

, Once you have the basic technique down, you can begin to decrease the interval between each stride, meaning you will pick up the pace and run faster. Try not to compromise your stride length as you increase your speed.

, To develop speed over long distances, first incorporate intervals of 30-second or one-minute sprints into your runs.

, Make sure to drink the recommended 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of fluid for men and 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of fluid for women per day.For runs over an hour long, you will need to drink water during your run.


Drink water up to two hours before a long run. During the run, sip water in small sips and frequently to avoid bloating or cramping.
After a long run, drink 500mL of water immediately, and then continue to sip water throughout the day to replenish your water supply., You can get lean protein from fish, chicken, turkey, tofu, eggs, and beans, just to name a few.


Salmon is one of the best sources of Omega-3 beneficial fats, which promote a healthy inflammation response. An increase in Omega-3's in your diet may also help reduce the symptoms of asthma.
One egg a day will give you 30% your daily value of Vitamin K, which promotes healthy bones. In addition, eggs contain all of the essential amino acids that aid in muscle recovery. After a long run, your body will thank you for replenishing your store of amino acids.
Avoid a diet high in red meat or processed meat. Both are thought to increase the risk of colorectal cancer, heighten bad cholesterol levels, and contribute to clogged arteries and a higher risk of heart attack.

, Nuts, especially almonds, are high in Vitamin E antioxidants and Omega-3 fatty acids that can help lower bad cholesterol levels in the body. Vitamin E also protects body tissue from potential damage from free radicals. Be aware that nuts are high in fat, so only consume the recommended serving size daily., Dark greens and berries are packed full of healthy antioxidants and greens are extremely rich in fiber, which promotes digestive regularity. Foods like sweet potatoes and carrots are rich in beta-carotene, a healthy antioxidant that promotes muscle recovery.

, When purchasing cereal, bread, crackers, and other carbohydrate-based foods, choose the whole grain or whole wheat option. Whole grains contain fiber and phytonutrients that support healthy digestion.

, Potassium decreases the likelihood that you will develop cramps while you run, helps keep you hydrated, and speeds up muscle recovery. Good sources of potassium include bananas, milk, yogurt, and potatoes., If you aren't getting enough Vitamin C from your diet, consider taking a Vitamin C supplement or multivitamin daily."

This is especially true the older and less active you are so prepare your foot and calf muscles and don’t do too much too soon., Whether you run completely barefoot or with thin shoes that simulate the same sensation, try running on a hard surface slowly. Only move for a few minutes to get use to the sensation and activity.Go slowly or incorporate this at the end of a regular run if you are already an active runner.


If you’re not a regular runner, first get your body and feet use to running in general. Run a very short distance for only a few minutes to being acclimating your body.
Running on a hard surface suits first time runners because it emphasizes natural running form. Shoes can compensate for improper form that pounds your heels and overextends your legs. Barefoot running gives no cushion so your heels may hurt as they impact the hard surface. Run as light as you can by landing softly on front and middle of your foot., After running with shoes, your body will need to dramatically alter your stride. While running on a hard surface can help with this, it can also mean injury from broken glass, and other dangerous debris found on hard city streets.Running on soft grass or sand can protect your feet but induce poor form resulting in other leg injuries.


If you have the money and time, get a thorough physical exam from a health professional and biomechanics assessment from a running specialist to ensure a safe and healthy transition into running barefoot., During your first week of training, schedule your training session to run barefoot for about a quarter mile to a full mile. Try to do this every other day so your body gets use to the rigors of increased distance.

, Try to run further each week, increasing your distance by about 10%. You don’t want to hurt yourself so gradually build your endurance. If you are sore then don’t increase the distance. Take time off to mend or maintain your regular training regiment until your soreness subsides.


Consult a doctor or healthcare specialist if the soreness you feel increases in intensity without further activity.

, Stop training and allow your body to recover if you experience pain. There is a difference between having sore muscles that are fatigued, and bone, joint, soft-tissue, or chest pain. Contact a doctor immediately if you are experiencing any chest pain.


Be patient with your training. Depending on a number of factors, including age and activity level, it may take months to attain the goals you want.

, Massage your muscles and the arches in your foot to break down scar tissue to help heal and strengthen them.


Yoga can be a great way to keep yourself limber and help your muscles recover faster.

, Keep your balance by running with a straight posture and picturing yourself running in place. Position your feet so each step is under your hips and shoulders.

, Be sure to balance your weight as too much emphasis on your forefeet can negatively affect your calves. Shorten your stride so as not to land on your heel.Traditionally, land heel first when in shoes but you want to land on your forefoot first when running barefoot because it keeps the landing gentle. Try to land on the ball of your foot.

, Gradually lower your heel followed by your foot and lower leg. Your calf will flex your ankle to control the landing so make sure to stretch and strengthen your calves to help lessen the impact.Similar to the conclusion of a jump, flex your hip, knee and ankle as you embrace the impact. Your landing should be as soft, springy, and comfortable as possible.

, If you feel like you’re plodding or pounding the ground, you could be hurting your joints. Add more spring to your step and imagine that your pounding footsteps are creating a loud sound with each step.Emphasize running as quietly as possible. Imagine yourself being a deer bounding through a field trying not to attract attention. , If one part of your foot is more sore that the others or if it leaves more of a mark, examine whether improper form is the cause. If you run barefoot on a soft a surface like a sandy beach, your body will compensate for the terrain and your muscles will adjust your running form. Always use proper technique no matter what the terrain.


If you have access to special equipment, sensory feedback will quickly tell you what needs to be corrected.

Get ready mentally.,
Take care of yourself.,
Have a plan.,
Stay hydrated.,
Once the race starts, stick to your plan.,
In the middle of the race, stick to passing people one at a time.,
If there is a little lead on you and the person ahead of you , take some time, run a little faster in the straight areas and where off some time in between you, because the guy in front of you is going to take it easy thinking you'll never catch up.,
Regardless of your plan, the last 200 meters should be your fastest, use all the energy you have left and go for it.",How to Run a Mile Race," If you think you can't run a fast mile, then you probably won't. Think positive thoughts, especially while you're running, and have someone in your family, or maybe just a friend, tell you positive things. (i.e ""this race is all yours!"" ""That kid in the red is your only competition, but you can leave him in the dust."") You will be surprised how much faster you will run with positive thoughts in your head.;
, Your mind is most of it but your body is important too. If your muscles are tight, your legs are hurting and you didn't stretch, you are probably not going to do very well. Always stretch before the race! This is important for any race. Your legs are one of the most important parts to stretch, but make sure you stretch your whole body before the run. You'd be surprised at how tired and sore your arms could get while running!

, As stated before, your mind plays a huge part in the race, so tell yourself what you are going to do. The mile is considered distance running so tell yourself your plan (i.e, ""I'm going to sprint the first 150 meters to get ahead, and keep a solid pace the rest of the race."" or ""I'm going to take it easy in the beginning and pass people during the race, then sprint the last 200 meters or so.""

, Water is one of the most important part of race preparation. Do not drink Gatorade before a race; the sugars will cause your body to slow down in the middle of the race. You should drink water throughout the day of the race, but not too much or you will get a cramp. Generally drink about 30-35% of you daily water needs before a race or about 3 or 4 cups of water.

, If you decided to sprint out at the beginning and someone passes you, tell yourself, ""He will die off before the race ends."" Or at the beginning if you take it easy and pass people and a few are too fast, say to yourself "" I'll catch them at the end.""

, Have a place and a time goal for yourself. If you wanted to finish 3rd at the worst with a time of 6:00 or better, and you are at 5th and you're at a pace for 5:50, you should keep your pace until the end then sprint to get to 3rd.

, Don't kill yourself though, because if he isn't running hard he is saving energy for the end. So you'll need some energy to pass him.

, Just remember, when you're running and you begin to get tired, just keep going, remembering that you can do it. At the end, as soon as you see the finish line in front of you, sprint towards it. You can do this!

"
"
Make sure you have a schedule planned.,
Follow your schedule strictly, do not become lazy as this will only hinder your goal in making it to the top three.,
In the actual race, start at a pace fast enough to keep up with the first group, but not so fast that you are sprinting.

,
Try to maintain a good pace, only speeding up in the last two laps.,
Sprint as fast as you can for the last lap, speeding up to 100% in the last 100-200 metres.",How to Run a One and a Half Mile Race," For example: Monday- 3 miles (4.8 km) on the trail, Tuesday- 2 miles (3.2 km) on the bleachers, Wednesday- mile run and weight-lifting, Thursday- timed mile, Friday- condition for meet, Saturday- run your heart out!, Sunday- rest, do 200 crunches minimum.;
, Do not skip a day of training and make sure it varies.

,, You should not let too many people pass you, especially near the end of the race. The fifth lap (or after 1.25 of a mile) pass the majority of people in the first group.

, You should be so tired you cannot speak!

Try body weight squats.,
Jump rope.,
Take your bicycle out, or join a cycling class.,
Try single-leg dead lifts.,
Practice yoga.,
Use core exercises.",How to Train to Run Faster1," These require no special equipment, increase your balance, and strengthen your leg muscles.Begin in a standing position.
Sit back as if you are sitting on a chair, but don't actually use a chair.
Keep your knees from moving too far forward. Don't let them go past your feet.
Keep moving back until you feel your muscles begin to strain.
Stand back up. Repeat until your muscles start to tire, and then take a break.;
, Jumping rope can build muscle and help increase speed.Begin with jumping with both feet. Stand with the rope behind you, bring it over, and lightly jump. You don't need to make an exaggerated jump, just enough to let the rope go under your feet. Continue increasing speed until you have a steady rhythm that you can maintain. This type of training builds endurance.Move on to alternating feet as you jump. Each time the rope comes around, switch to the other foot. You're basically running in place with a jump rope. This technique uses the same stride and muscles as running, so it helps to build a good rhythm for later running.Begin with a minute, and break for 30 seconds. As your endurance builds, you can add time between breaks, up to 3 minutes. Repeat as many as five times., Cycling requires you to have flexible hips for rotation, just like running. It also works on your pacing.Cycle instead of one of your weekly runs. Since cycling uses the same muscles and rhythms as running, it can help you increase your strength and speed over time. Choose a flat area or one that only has a slight incline. Try to mimic the same speed you normally would running, such as 90 rpms on the bike if you normally run at 180 steps per minute.Incorporate sprints that mimic your runs. That is, if you normally alternate between sprinting for a minute and slowing for a minute, do the same on your bike., Dead lifts help balance and build muscle, increasing your speed.Bend forward with a weight in each hand.
At the same time, lift one leg backwards. Keep the knee of the other leg bent.
Lower the weights to slightly below your knees, then slowly stand back up. Repeat for a set of 8, then move to the other leg.

, Yoga can increase flexibility, which can help you go faster. Try incorporating it into your morning routine to make you more flexible throughout the day.For example, use the cow-face fold. While sitting, pull one heel around your body so it's touching the other hip.Place the other leg on top of the first one, pulling the heel around towards the other hip. Your heels should each be touching the opposite hip, and one knee should be stacked on the other. This position stretches your leg muscles and increases flexibility., Core exercises strengthen your body as a whole, sustaining you when you're running.Try planking. Lay face down on the floor. Raise yourself up on your elbows and toes with your body straight. Hold the position. To increase difficulty, lift your right arm and left leg at the same time, then do the opposite.Switch to a single-leg glute bridge. Lay on one side. Balance on your elbow and the foot that's on the ground, keeping your body straight. Raise your other leg up and down. Do the same on the other side."
"
Use stride interval training.Over a period of time, interval training increases how fast you can run by forcing you to use muscles at a higher capacity.Begin running at a steady pace.,
For variety, try fartlek.,
Increase intensity with hill intervals.",How to Train to Run Faster2,"
Increase your speed for a particular interval. You can use distance markers on a track or a timer if you're running through a neighborhood.
Keep the increases short, at about 20 seconds or so.
Once you are at your top speed, slow back down.Repeat as you're able, increasing the number per workout over time.

, Similar to strides, you increase your speed for short bursts. However, instead of doing it at regular intervals, you do it as you feel moved to do so. Also, you can add in other movements, such as jumping or bounding instead of running more quickly.To try fartlek, increase your speed as you feel like it while running. Go up to your top speed, and then decrease down again. Alternatively, switch to hopping or bouncing instead. Keep these bursts at less than a minute.
Like strides, fartlek can increase your overall speed by stretching your capacity in short bursts.

, Going uphill helps keep you in proper running form. It forces you to pick your knees and feet up and makes you use your arms to help move yourself upward. Running uphill also builds your muscles, as you're fighting against gravity.Choose a road or hill with a slight incline. You should be able to go back downhill when you are in the recovery stage of your workout.Increase your speed in short bursts. Go faster for short periods, keeping it under a minute for each interval.Use the down slope for recovery. Once you've made it up the hill, gently jog down the hill for recovery.Hill intervals can increase speed, as they improve technique, increase strength, and push your capacity to make you go faster.

"
"
Stretch and warm-up before you run.,
Shorten your stride.,
Let your muscles breathe.,
Work on form.,
Use a treadmill.,
Make your arms work for you.",How to Train to Run Faster3," Stretching helps flexibility, which makes your stride better.Use dynamic stretches that move your body while stretching. For instance, start by swinging your arms frontward and backward, then moving on to twisting the top half of your body around to each side.
Next, try forward lunges. Step forward with one knee, bringing the other knee almost to the ground. Step forward with the other leg, bringing the other knee almost to the ground. Continue forward with the lunges.Move on to exercises that will warm up your muscles. For instance, you can hop in place. You can also jog slowly in place bringing your knees up high, and then jog slowly in place while trying to pull your heels up higher in the back as you jog., Faster runners actually take more steps than slower runners.One way to shorten your stride is to run while jumping rope. That is, take the jump rope out to the track with you.
Start out how you would normally jump rope, using two feet.Begin alternating feet, running in place while jumping.Move forward while jumping. Once you get the rhythm, start running around the track while still using the jump rope. The jump rope helps rein in your stride.Another way to shorten your stride is to count your steps in a minute, and then try to up that number little by little., That is, maximize your oxygen intake by using your nose and mouth to inhale and exhale. Your muscles need oxygen to work their best.Take some time to focus on your breathing. As you're running, concentrate on breathing through both your mouth and nose at the same time and blowing air out through both at the same time. If you notice you're only breathing through one or the other, take a moment to focus and correct it.

, Keep your posture good, and hit the ground with the middle of your foot. Your foot should land below your hip.For good posture, imagine you have a string running up your back that keeps everything upright and straight. Keep your chin up, literally, and focus ahead. Also, try to relax your body, including your shoulders, neck, and jaw., A treadmill forces a pace, which means you must go that fast, which can increase your speed over time. Try going for a particular interval at a slightly faster speed than normal.While running on the treadmill, increase the pace for 1 to 5 minutes, then push it back down.

, Focus on swinging your arms close to your body, which will also help keep your legs inline. Keeping your legs inline is better technique, which can help your run faster."

Be persistent.,
Keep your workout gear ready.,
Pick a convenient time for your workout.,
Run with a group.,
Change your training day to day.,
Take it easy.,
Eat right.,
Fuel your workouts.,
Get your sleep.",How to Train to Run Faster4," The best way to strength train and run faster is to be consistent with your workouts. Try not to skip workouts even when life gets in the way., When you come home from a workout, take out your dirty clothes and put in what you need to be ready to go the next time. Take down as many barriers as you can to your workouts., That is, pick one that you can stick with. If you're not a morning person, you may not be able to stick to a morning schedule, so choose another time of day.

, Not only can a group encourage you to go faster, it means you are held accountable for showing up., If you always do the same workout everyday, you'll hit a plateau. By changing things up, you'll continue to strengthen your muscles.That's why important to practice cross-training. Try replacing running with cycling or swimming 1 to 2 days a week.

, Some days, you need a lesser workout to let your body have rest. You don't need to run full-out every day., Make sure your diet includes what you need to succeed. Eat balanced meals that include a substantial amount of fruits and vegetables, as well as a lean protein.

, Before your workout, eat a carbohydrate-rich snack, which will fuel your workout.Skip simple sugars, such as candies and juice, and grab more sustaining carbohydrates, such as whole grains and fruit., Your body needs rest to work properly and recover from muscle strain and soreness.If you have trouble remembering to go to bed on time, set an alarm 30 minutes before you should be in bed to remind you to wind down.

"
"
Warm up before the race.,
Choose your best starting position.,
Keep a steady start.,
Swing your arms.,
Don't sprint at the beginning of a distance race.,
Stay humble.,
Don't get distracted.,
If you are running in an oval racetrack, try to be in the lane closest to the center because it takes you the shortest time to complete the track.

,
If you'd like, drink an energy drink or eat chocolate before the race.,
Keep your hands loose in a long distance run.",How to Win a Running Race," Practice steadily every day with good workout routines that make your muscles hurt. The day before the race, work out a little and then rest up well.;
, Once the ref says ""set"" breathe in air. It helps you last longer in a sprint as you should breathe in your nose and out your mouth, it keeps you from cramping up in a longer race.

, If you get a shaky one you won't get a good position.

, The faster the better, your legs will go faster as well.

, This is a waste of energy and it tires you out. Just sprint a bit for a couple of seconds to help you keep in a good position, then just jog to not get tired and on the last laps, sprint hard to come in a high position.

, If you are very proud of yourself then you think it is too easy and you will come in a fairly low position. But keep your self confidence saying "" I can do it"". But don't have ""false humility"" and think you are a terrible runner; that will make you do worse.

, This will throw your rhythm off. Don't be startled by the pistol if one is used.

,, It will give you extra strength, but do not do it in a marathon!

, Clenching them will tighten your muscles and make it harder to run. If you get tired during a long distance race, just speed walk using your arms.

"
"
Train hard mentally and physically.,
Before, during, and after a race, have good sportsmanship.,
Set yourself up in a good position at the starting line so you can start ahead of the others.,
While running, stay focused at what's ahead of you (the remaining distance and the finish line).,
After you cross the finish line, first place or not, don't stop all of a sudden.",How to Win in a Sprinting Race," The worst thing that could happen to even the fastest runner is when he or she suddenly feels less confident, is stressed out, gets out of control, etc. As well as jogging and stretching daily, sleeping well, and eating good food, try exercising your mental aspects by meditating, viewing appropriate media, socializing more, etc.;
, Treat others the way you want to be treated.

, See how to position your body in the Tips section below.

, Swing your arms hard, directly forward and back, enough to give yourself momentum. Move your legs fast and far apart. If you look towards the audience/onlookers or anyone behind you, you will lose your focus on what's ahead of you.

, You may accidentally get hit by anyone that may be behind you, or you would injure your legs from ""braking"" too fast. Gradually slow down once you pass the finish line, from a run, to a jog, and finally to a walk.

Refrain from wearing too much.,
Wear a waterproof outer layer.,
Prevent rain from getting in your eyes.,
Watch out for obstacles when running.,
Adjust your form for greater safety.,
Plan your route ahead of time.,
Warm up for your run somewhere dry.,
Increase your visibility.,
Protect your technology from water damage.,
Prevent chafing.,
Change into dry clothes.,
Remember to hydrate.,
Dry your shoes.",How to Run in the Rain," You'll want to wear clothes that are close fitting for your rain run. This will minimize the irritation caused by wet fabric rubbing against your skin. Additionally, the clothing you wear will absorb water in the rain, becoming heavy. The more clothing you wear, the heavier the clothing will become.


If it is especially cold outside, consider wearing a few layers of close fitting clothing, like spandex.Moisture wicking fabric is designed to pull moisture to the outer surface of the fabric, where it'll cause less irritation and evaporate most easily.;
, In some cases you might not have a light, breathable waterproof jacket or poncho. In this situation, you can cut a hole in a garbage bag, stick your head through the hole, and wear it as a homemade poncho. While this won't keep you perfectly dry, it will minimize wetness.


As you run, your body will heat up. This can cause your waterproof outer layer to become uncomfortably hot. For this reason, you may want to purchase a jacket that folds up into a small pouch or more portable size., The easiest way to cut down on rain falling into your eyes and blinding you is by wearing a hat with a brim or a visor. The headband of your hat or visor will also help prevent water collecting in your hair from dripping down your face and getting in your eyes., Keep your eyes peeled even more than you would running on clear days. The clouds overhead will make it more difficult to see or be seen while running your route. You may want to decrease your pace so you have more time to react.Some rain clouds are very dark and can significantly reduce your ability to clearly see. You may want to have a flashlight in hand to shine on your path and reveal potential obstacles.

, If the conditions are slick or you feel unsure of your footing, you may need to shorten your stride. A shorter stride will also help you compensate if you misjudge the distance between your foot and the ground. This often happens when stepping into puddles that are deeper than you realize.


Wind and rain may have cause puddles and piles of leaves to form. Be wary of these, as they can hide curbs and potholes.Although it is common to see this in rain runners, avoid shuffling while running in the rain., Choose a route that is well lit and maintained. This will not only make it easier for people to see you, but will minimize potential injury due to obstacles, like broken pavement or roots.


Routes that follow major roads can lead you to getting accidentally (or purposefully) soaked by passing cars.
Avoid routes that are muddy. These can become slick in the rain and cause you to slip and fall., Before you start your rain run, gear up indoors and do some basic stretches. Touch your toes and do other leg stretches to prevent muscular strain and cramping.


Warming up is also important when the weather is cold. Stretches and other warm ups will heat your body and make the cold less bitter., You might purchase a reflective vest from a running, sports, or sporting goods store and wear this to improve your visibility. If a reflective vest is outside of your price range, you can buy reflective tape at most hardware stores and general retailers. Put some of this tape onto your clothing before your rain run so you're easier to see.


When visibility is especially poor, you may want to take a flashlight or a blinking LED on your run., You can buy waterproof covers for cell phones or music players at most general retailers. For a more economical cover, place you phone in a plastic bag. Then tape the bag closed with a water resistant or waterproof tape, like duct tape.


Even if a cover or case claims to be waterproof, it is common for small amounts of moisture to seep in. For this reason, you may not want to run in the rain with any technology at all.
Remember to remove any technology from your person that will not stand up to the rain. Watches, for example, are frequently overlooked., This condition is more likely to occur when you're wet than dry. To protect against chafing, spread petroleum jelly (or a similar produce, like Vaseline or Body Glide) on the areas you normally chafe or blister. Some common chafing areas include:


Feet, inner thighs, underarms, sports bra lines (for women), and nipples (for men)., Remove your wet clothes and change into warm, dry ones after you finish your run. If it was especially cold or if you picked up some mud or dirt while running, you may want to take a warm shower.


Even if your body feels warm, when you're wet you have a greater chance of getting hypothermia, which is a dangerous lowering of your body temperature., There will be plenty of water on your rain run, but little of this will be absorbed into your system. This can cause some runners to forget to stay hydrated when running in the rain. Drink small amounts of water consistently throughout long runs, or have a glass of water after shorter runs., If you have insoles in your shoes, first remove these. After that, stuff your shoes loosely with newspaper. Newspaper will help prevent the shape of your shoe from deforming even as it pulls out moisture the shoe has absorbed. Depending on the wetness of your shoes, you may need to replace the newspaper several times.


You may be tempted to put your shoes on a heater to dry them more quickly. Avoid doing this, as it can degrade the rubber and glue your shoe is made of.
When you need to dry your wet shoes quickly, set a hair dryer to low heat and use this to dry your shoes.
If you run frequently in the rain, you may want an extra pair of running shoes. This way you can rotate between pairs and allow more drying time for wet shoes."

Promote balance.,
Teach kids to understand coordination.,
Incorporate equipment such as agility ladders.,
Practice running consistently to build speed.,
Resist overtraining.,
Condition muscles.",How to Teach Kids To Run Faster1," Kids need to be able to stay on their feet while they run fast, and speed requires balance.


Utilize drills such as standing or jumping on one foot at a time to increase balance.;
, Their brains have to coordinate a lot of movements when they run.


Practice running. Before you concentrate on the speed, make sure kids know how to run properly, with good posture and relaxed limbs. You don't want them to look at their feet while they run, or valuable oxygen will be lost. Kids are also prone to squeezing their fists, which takes blood away from the heart and lungs.
Build speed and intensity as the children master the skill of running. Use running drills or encourage them to race each other.

, These are ladders you lay on the ground for children to step through as they run. It will increase good form and proper running technique.


Let kids practice their speed. If they kick the agility ladder or stumble, have them start over until they can get through it smoothly. Once they are able to master that, they can work on getting through it faster.

, Running fast is a skill and kids will only run faster if they practice and develop a consistent pace of improvement.


Develop a schedule. Have your kids run every day at a specific time, in a specific place.

, Too much intensity can cause injuries or lead the kids to lose interest in running. Recovering from a daily run is just as important for speed as the running itself.

, In order to run fast, kids will have to have a strong and stable core. Make sure general strength conditioning is part of any running program.


Instruct kids to do sit-ups, push-ups and other conditioning. This will strengthen their entire muscular system, enabling them to run faster.

, It is really scary and quite dangerous to run with traffic and you may get clipped by bad drivers that just weren't paying any attention.

, There are great for eluding all the cars and exhaust that will demote your lungs and overall running abilities. You will want to take the longest path and down every street possible in these areas. This way you will not have to run on the busy streets quite as much.

,, You will have to run for a longer distance if you just go at a straight level pace.

, This will ensure that they will be nice and loose and prevent soreness the next day. Additional stretching will also help with this.

, A large poster board or a bulletin board with times and distances will allow kids to monitor how they are improving.

, For example, once a kid achieves running a mile in less than 8 minutes, give him a prize or a special treat. Children respond to rewards and incentives.

, Set up obstacle courses, or break them into teams for relays so they can cheer each other on.

, Instead of standing on the sidelines with a stopwatch, get out there and do some running yourself. Having you there to motivate them will help the kids run faster.

Add strength training and plyometrics.",How to Run a Fast Mile," Do a few paced sprints to get your heart rate up. Mentally go through the race in your head. Know what times you want to have at each lap.;
, You'll want to start out a little faster than what is necessary to get your target time.


Psychologically, you're going to slow down as you get further into the mile, so make sure this first lap is good to compensate. At the same time, don't spend all of your energy on this lap.
A good example would be, if you want to run a 5:00 mile, each lap would need to be 75 seconds. A good time for your first lap would be 71 to 73 seconds. It's not too fast, but it's fast enough to give you some security.

, This is the lap which should be right on target. In the 5:00 minute mile we mentioned earlier, Lap 2 is the lap which should be exactly 75 seconds, so your time at the halfway point should be 2:26-2:28.


If you've been running 400m sprints, then you'll know the exact pace that you need to run this lap. You'll feel your body's muscle memory click into place.
Your adrenaline rush will probably start to wear off midway through this lap, and you'll start feeling it. Stay focused on maintaining your running form and keeping up your pace.

, Mentally and physically, this is the toughest lap for most people. More often than not, this lap will determine whether you hit your target time or not. Chances are, you will slow down from your original pace.


In our 5:00 mile example, most people will run Lap 3 in between 77 to 78 seconds. However, since the first lap was hopefully strong, this puts us almost perfectly at 3:45.
Make a conscious effort to keep pace on this lap or else you will fall behind. Remember, your next lap is the one that counts!

, This is it. You're almost there. That's what you need to be telling yourself at this point. You probably slowed down on your previous lap, so you need to really strut your stuff on this one and mentally push it to get to that time.


Especially important is the last 200 meters. On most tracks, that's the final curve. This is where you ""kick.""
All that can be said about this lap is that you need to mentally give it your all, and you'll make that target time. Just believe in yourself.

, For about 6 to 10 seconds as you go around the curves of the track, pick up your pace. This will help you to shave even more seconds off of your time.

, You'll slowly ramp up your running distance and speed while cross-training to prevent injury. Follow this progression:



Monday: 1 to 2 mile (1.6 to 3.2 km) jog

Tuesday: Bike or go swimming

Wednesday: 1 to 2 mile (1.6 to 3.2 km) jog

Thursday: Go biking or swimming

Friday: 1 to 2 mile (1.6 to 3.2 km) jog

, On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, jog 2 to 3 miles (3.2 to 4.8 km). Continue biking or swimming on Tuesday and Thursday.

, Skipping running may seem strange, but beginners are very vulnerable to injury. You'll pick up again in Week 4.

, Aim for a 12-minute mile. Run 3 miles (4.8 km) on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Bike or swim on Tuesday and Thursday.

, Continue to increase your speed. Follow this routine:



Monday: Run 2 miles (3.2 km)

Tuesday: Run 3 miles (4.8 km)

Wednesday: Off--no exercise

Thursday: Run 4 miles (6.4 km)

Friday: Run 2 miles (3.2 km)

, You should be trying to run a 10-minute mile. Here's your pattern for the week:



Monday: Run 2 to 3 miles (3.2 to 4.8 km)

Tuesday: Run 3 to 4 miles (4.8 to 6.4 km)

Wednesday: Off--no exercise

Thursday: Run 4 to 5 miles (6.4 to 8.0 km)

Friday: Run 2 to 3 miles (3.2 to 4.8 km)

, Try to run for as long as you can at your goal pace. Track yourself to see how long you can maintain the pace that you want.

Tuesday: Run 6 to 8 sprints of 1/4 mile (400 m) at a pace of between 90 seconds to 2 minutes per interval. Between each interval, jog slowly for 1 to 2 minutes so that your body can recover.

Wednesday: Take the day off, swim or do an upper body workout.

Thursday: Run 2 miles (3.2 km), timing your pace to see how quickly you can complete your miles. Then, jog 2 miles (3.2 km) at a slower pace.

Friday: Run 3 miles (4.8 km) worth of intervals at a pace of between 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Really push yourself today to see if you can increase your pace. If you drop below your pace, take 2 minutes to walk or jog and then try to get back on pace. If you can't keep up a steady pace, go back to intervals. Just push yourself as hard as you can.

Saturday: Jog 4 to 6 miles (6.4 to 9.7 km) at an easy pace.

, Stay at goal pace throughout both miles.

Tuesday: Run 6 to 8 sprints of 1/2 mile (800 m) at a pace of between 3 and 4 minutes. You want to increase your distance while keeping your pace the same.

Wednesday: Take the day off, swim or do upper body strength training

Thursday: Run 2 miles (3.2 km) at your goal pace and then jog 2 miles (3.2 km) at a relaxed pace.

Friday: Run 3 miles (4.8 km) at your goal pace. If you can't keep up your goal pace, switch to intervals or try walking or jogging for 2 minutes before trying to run again at goal pace.

Saturday: Long, leisurely run of 4 to 6 miles (6.4 to 9.7 km). Make sure to stretch well., Choose someone who runs about the same speed as yourself if possible, as this provides encouragement and friendly competition. While you can train alone, training with a team of similar runners is a huge motivation booster. But, for some people a running buddy can slow you down, so you don't have to have a running buddy, but it's a good option to consider.

, Whether your goal is 10 minutes, 8 minutes or 6 minutes, you have to be extremely focused to break a personal record. The body will emulate your thoughts. If you believe something won't happen, then it most likely won't happen.

, Always do a 5 to 10 minute warmup and cool down. Adding warmups and cool downs to your routine will prevent injury.

, Posture is crucial and sometimes is what prevents many people from running faster.


Look at the horizon, not at your feet. Tilting your head at this angle will align and straighten your neck and back.
Keep your shoulders level and loose. If they start to come up toward your ears, then stop running and shake them out or stretch them gently.
Place your arms at a 90-degree angle and allow them to go forward and backward instead of across your body. Keep your fists unclenched with your finger lightly touching your palms.
Run tall. If you find that your torso is slouching, then take a deep breath and feel your torso naturally straighten. Maintain the improved posture while you exhale.
Keep your hips naturally aligned with your torso. Bending at the hips puts unwanted pressure on your lower back.
Take the right size strides. With each step, your foot should land directly beneath your body with your knee slightly bent. If your foot is landing in front of your body, then you are taking too long of a stride., Drink plenty of water. Around 64 fluid ounces of liquid a day.

, Strength training will improve your stamina, and plyometrics will help you to bring bursts of speed to your run.

,How to Train for a 5K1,
"
Make sure you're physically able to run a 5K.,
Make enough time to train.,
Sign up for a race.,
Get appropriate running gear.,
Set a goal.",How to Train for a 5K2," You don't have to be incredibly physically fit to run a 5K, but you do have to make sure that the training won't pose a risk to your health. Though you can work yourself up to a 5K if you've never run before, you need to make sure that your heart and body are physically strong enough to handle the race training.


If you have a history of heart trouble, back pain, or any issues with your feet or the rest of your body, check with a doctor to see if you can run the race.
Even if you feel healthy, it's never a bad idea to check in with a doctor about the race just in case.

, This requires two things: for you to make sure you have enough weeks between your first training day and the race, and to see that you'll actually have enough time in your schedule to train for the race.


If you can run at least one mile without stopping, then you can start training 8 weeks before the 5K.
If you can't run to the end of your block without getting tired, it will take longer for you to train for a race. Give yourself at least 12 weeks to build up the stamina to run a 5K.
Check your schedule to make sure you have time to train. While training for a 5K can require just 20-30 minutes of your time 5 days a week, it may be harder than you think to factor this time into your busy schedule.
Select a time slot for your training, leaving room for two days of rest. It's ideal if you can train for the race around the same time each day so your body gets settled into a routine. It's even more ideal if you can train around the time of the actual race you choose, but that may be challenging if the race is in the morning, as most are.

, Search for races in your area and pick one that appeals to you that is far enough away for you to have enough time to train. Don't pick a race that is too far off in the future unless you want to hold off on your training for a while.


Register for the race as early as you can. Once you've registered, you have made a commitment to finish the race! The longer you put off actually registering for the race you've chosen, the less real your goal will seem.
Registering early will also usually save you some money.

, Though you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get the best running gear, it will be much easier to get through your training runs, as well as the actual race, if you're well equipped. Here are some things to get:


Running shoes. Your shoes are the most important form of running equipment. Go to a running store and get help finding the perfect shoes for your feet. If you already have running shoes, the rule of thumb is that you should get a new pair of shoes every time you've run 300–400 miles (480–640 km).

Even if you're not sure if you've run that far in your old shoes, if they feel worn-down or just not right, consider getting a new pair of shoes.


Running apparel. Invest in some clothes made especially for running, which are any non-cotton synthetic fabrics like DriFit or CoolMax. Cotton clothes will absorb your sweat and will wear you down. Instead, get synthetic running shorts, spandex, tank tops, or t-shirts. Running socks. Get thin, stretchy socks that are made for running. If you run in bulky cotton socks, your feet will be instantly weighed down.
A digital watch. If you want to want to time yourself, a watch is your best option. You can also use the clock on your iPod or phone, if you run with those.

, This is easy. Do you just want to run the whole race, or do you have a goal time that you want to beat? Having a goal before you start training can help you determine how to approach your training from the very first day.


If you just want to run the whole race, you don't have to worry about timing as much during your training.
If you're determined to run the 5K in a certain amount of time, then you should work on trimming down your time as you train.

"
"
Pick your training plan.,
Allow for two days of rest per week.,
Make time for cross-training for at least one day of the week.,
Don't forget to stretch before or after your training runs.,
Gradually build toward running a 5K at the end of each week.,
Allow some room for flexibility.,
Stay healthy.",How to Train for a 5K3," Pick a plan that works best based on your running abilities and goals. If you've never run before, your training routine will be different from the routine of someone who is a champion sprinter and wants to run a 5K in under 25 minutes. Check out online running resources to see which training schedule works for you.Once you pick your plan, you should write it into your planner so you know what you're doing every day for the next eight weeks.

, Don't wear yourself out by running and training every day. Pick two days that are far enough apart that fit your schedule.


Typical rest days are Mondays and Fridays.

, You should ideally cross-train one or two days every week. Cross-training is anything from biking or swimming to using elliptical at the gym.


Plug two days of cross training into your routine, but take one of them off to rest if you need to.

, Stretching will maximize your performance and prevent injury.

, Run the same distance for 2 days a week, such as Mondays and Thursdays, and build toward running a slightly longer distance on your long run day, which will be a Saturday or Sunday. Here is what your training should look like if you are able to run one mile before you start training:


Run one mile on the Tuesday and Thursday of the first week, and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) on the first Saturday of that week.
On the second week, run 1.5 miles (2.4 km) on Tuesday and Thursday and then 1.75 miles (2.82 km) on Saturday, and so on.
By the seventh week, you should be running 2 or 3 miles (3.2 or 4.8 km) on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 3 miles (4.8 km) by Saturday.
On the last week, you can train during the week but rest on the day before the race instead of doing your long run.
Go online to find a way to measure the distance of the streets in your town. You can also run these distances on a treadmill, but running outside is optimal for race training., Though it would be amazing to be able to do what you say you're going to do for 8 or even 12 weeks in a row, it's likely that you'll have to make some adjustments, whether it's because you got a cold, have another obligation to attend to, or if your body just feels too tired to do anything that day.


If you have to skip a day, keep up the rest of your schedule. If you miss a cross-training day and you have a running day the next day, just start back up on the running day. You shouldn't have to shift your entire schedule around because you missed one day.
If you have to miss a week of training because of a cold or minor injury, don't worry. It's better to take time for your body to recover than to make yourself feel worse. Just try to get back on schedule as soon as you can.

, It's important to maintain your health while you train for a 5K. Your training won't get you very far if you're not trying to be as healthy as you can in all aspects of your life. Though you can still have fun, you should aim to maintain a healthy diet and a regular sleeping schedule.


Eat three healthy and balanced meals a day. Have a blend of carbs, proteins, fruits, and vegetables in your diet.Work on going to bed and waking up at the same time so you build up a regular sleeping schedule.
Though you can still drink alcohol from time to time, try not to overindulge the nights before your training runs.
Don't overdo it. If you feel physically exhausted after all of your training, take a break. You want to reach your physical peak on your race day, not several weeks before.

"
"
Get lots of rest.,
Prepare for the weather.,
Be familiar with the course.,
Eat the right foods.,
Get in the zone when you get to the race.,
Do what you've been doing — just kick it up a notch.",How to Train for a 5K4," Though you may find it hard to sleep the night before your race, you should try to get to bed as early as you can and wake up with plenty of time to get ready for the race. You should also focus on getting a lot of rest not just the night before the race, but the day before that as well as earlier that week.


If you haven't already, you should spend the week before the race waking up around the same time as you will for the race to get your body in gear.
Part of being well-rested means having your body feel rested as well. Don't train the day before the race. Take it easy the two days before the race.

, Check the forecast the night before so you can lay out the clothes you need right then instead of scrambling to find them in the morning. Remember not to overdress; your body will warm up once you start running.


If it's a bit chilly in the morning, wear a sweatshirt to the race and leave it with a friend or at the check-in for your belongings.

, Before you start the race, you should not only know where the course is, but you should know what the course looks like. If the course is near you, then you'll be even more confident if you've practiced running along it before race day. Here's what you should know:


What does the course look like? Is it a circle, or a line from one path to another? Are there hills, or is it flat? If you know where the hills are, it'll be easier to prepare for them mentally.
Where are the water stations? You should know where they are so you can use them as landmarks.
Where are the bathrooms? Though the race will be short, knowing where the bathrooms are can put you at ease.

, You don't need to carbo-load the night before a 5K race or the morning of the race. Eating too much, or to soon before the race, can leave you feeling stuffed or give you some digestive trouble. Here's what you should and should not eat:


The night before a 5K, eat around six or seven o'clock in the evening, so you don't go to bed feeling stuffed. Eat simple carbs like whole grain pasta, bread, or rice, and some protein like chicken and fish. You can eat a little bit of vegetables, which have fiber, for balance, but remember that they will be more likely to upset your digestive system.
Eat at least 1.5 to 2 hours before the race. You should be at the finish line feeling neither hungry nor full. If you're hungry, you may run out of energy, and if you're too full, you may feel too sluggish to run at your normal pace.
Focus on eating carbs the morning of the race.
If you normally have caffeine, have a little bit of coffee or tea, but be aware that it could hurt your digestive system.

, Get to the race at least half an hour early so you have enough time to pick up your bib and other race materials, to use the bathroom, and to get warmed up. Once you get to the race, you should work on getting in the zone, and doing whatever you have to do to have an amazing race day. Here are a few things you can do:


Maintain a positive attitude. You should be excited to be surrounded by other runners, not intimidated or nervous. Remember that's not really a race. You're not there to win first place, but to try your hardest and improve your fitness.
Listen to your favorite ""pump up"" music. If you love running to music, pick your favorite jams and bob to them at the starting line.
Jog a little bit to get yourself in the grove. Don't sprint a mile before the race. Just jog fifty feet from time to time to get your body active and get your limbs warmed up.
Stretch. Don't forget to stretch before the big race. Do the stretches you've been working on throughout your training.

, Remember that the 5K is the last extension of your training practice. You shouldn't try to sprint your hardest at the beginning because it feels like everyone is running fast, and you shouldn't run much slower than you normally do because you're afraid of running out of energy.


Check your watch from time to time to make sure you're relatively on schedule. Race day will fill you with adrenaline, so don't be surprised if you're going a bit faster than usual. That's okay as long as you don't feel exhausted after the first five minutes.
Stop for water breaks. Use this time to slow down for a second and get hydrated. You don't have to stop at every station if you're really feeling pumped, but try to make a habit of it.
Don't forget to have fun! Don't huff and puff through your first 5K. It's hard work, but you should have a big smile on your face when you cross that finish line!

Stick to the person who is ahead of everyone else.",How to Run a Good 800," The 800m start line is a curved line on the track. A good place to be is wherever you feel comfortable, often being next to someone you know is around the same ability can be helpful. Also remember to stay in your lane or you could be disqualified.;
, When the race begins you will feel like everyone is running too fast for you. Do not give up; everyone is feeling the same way, stick with the pack, and keep the strides long.

, After 200m the pace will have slowed, but not by much. Look good for the crowd on the 400m straight, and keep your eyes on the leader; when the bell rings, he will dart.

, It is long and hard, but do not give up. Pace yourself and take deep breaths.

, Begin to speed up the frequency of your step, while keeping the same stride length. In the last 100, always catch the person in front, pump the arms and know it will be over very soon.


During the last 200m it may seem as if you're moving your feet faster but not moving any faster while you accelerate, but in reality you are running faster but you are too tired to notice it.

Avoid looking down.,
Keep your shoulders relaxed.,
Bend your elbows at a 90-degree angle.,
Relax your hands.,
Lean slightly forward.,
Level your knees.,
Land on the middle of your foot.,
Synchronize your breathing.",How to Run a Faster 1500M1," Looking down while running can reduce your speed substantially. It also creates tension in your shoulders and neck. Instead, look straight ahead by focusing on a point 30 to 40 meters (100 to 130 feet) ahead of you. Maintain this position throughout the run., Your shoulders should be down and back, not hunched. If you begin to feel your shoulders hunch, relax them immediately.Running with hunched shoulders can restrict your breathing.

, Your arms should be relaxed at your sides with your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. As you run, swing your arms forward and back in a straight motion. Try not to let your arms cross in front of your chest as you run. This movement will waste energy and slow you down.Swinging your arms in a straight forward and backward motion will help propel you forward.

, Your hands should be relaxed as well. Avoid clenching them into fists while you run. Instead, keep them in a relaxed fist with your thumbs resting on top of your fingers., As you run, keep your back straight and lean forward slightly. This will not only help you propel yourself forward, but it will also help you land on the middle of your foot instead of your heel., While you run, try to avoid lifting your knees higher than your hips. Instead, keep them level at your hips. When your foot lands on the ground, try to land with a slight bend in your knee. This will help absorb some of the impact. Remember that your knees should be moving forward, not upward.

, Do this instead of landing on your heel or your toes. Landing on the middle of your foot will help you lift it faster, and thus, you may be able to run faster.Additionally, when your foot hits the ground, it should land below your hips.

, For medium intensity running, aim for two steps while breathing in and two steps while breathing out. For high intensity running (like during the final stretch of a race), aim for one step while breathing in and one step while breathing out.Make sure to use both your nose and mouth when inhaling to get the maximum amount of oxygen into your body.
Try to avoid shallow breathing. Focus on breathing deeply by pushing your stomach out as you inhale and contracting it as you exhale.

Eat the right diet.,
Keep properly hydrated.,
Stretch properly.,
Set a training schedule.,
Understand the mechanics of your run.The 800m run is a middle-distance race.,
Run often.,
Rest and recover.,
Hydrate and energize your body.,
Stretch your muscles.,
Run your 800m.,
Cool down.",How to Run a Faster 800m," By improving your eating habits, you will decrease your body fat and fatigue, while gaining muscle and endurance. Not eating right could be what is holding you back from breaking your 800m record.


Eat a variety of wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.This will improve your body composition. Increase protein and the right amount of carbohydrates, as these will provide your body with the nutrients to build muscle and to give your body energy.If you’re training for 30-45 minutes, shoot for about 3 grams (0.11 oz) of carbs on training days.
If you’re training for 46-60 minutes, shoot for about 5 grams (0.18 oz) of carbs on training days.


Avoid processed high-sugar and high-sodium foods. These will hinder your body from running efficiently.
Eat the right pre and post-workout carbohydrate-rich snacks. These should be consumed an hour before working out and within 30 minutes after a workout. Bananas, protein shakes and non-caffeinated energy bars are ideal.;
, Your body needs about two liters on an average day to stay properly hydrated.On days when running, you need to drink extra water to compensate for your output and prevent yourself from slowing down. Don’t just chug extra water though; listen to your body and drink when thirsty.


Pre and post-workout hydration is vital. An hour before you start your run, try to drink about 16 ounces (450 g) of water. Drink the same amount of water after running.
Look for signs of dehydration. Feeling thirsty or experiencing dry mouth, headaches, light-headedness, lack of urination and constipation are all the body's ways of letting you know that you are dehydrated.If you begin to experience any of these symptoms, it's best to increase your water intake.

, By stretching properly, you can improve your stride and your stride length (increasing your speed). Stretching before and after your workout will also help to prevent injury.Muscles to stretch include your leg muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps and adductors) and your lower body (hip flexors and glutes). Try to add two or three longer stretch routines a week to your workout schedule.

Do some yoga to help you with your flexibility.

, You won’t be able to run a faster 800m in one day. Just like training for a marathon, the best way to achieve your goals is to set a schedule. By following a training plan you can perform at a peak performance, even when running a shorter distance.Set an end date and work backward. Even with an 800m run, pick a date that you want to accomplish this run with your best time ever.
Do one or two quality and intense workouts a week. These include running hills or tempo runs.
Pick rest days where you can do some other sort of moderate exercise like yoga to stay limber.

, These rely on the runner being able to maintain a fast pace throughout the race and then being able to sprint in the last stretch. Working out is going to require you to hone in on the following three abilities:


Develop middle-distance running mechanics. This is also known as speed-stamina. You're going to need to establish a fast pace for the beginning of the race while maintaining control of your body. The goal is to be able to maintain a comfortable, but fast pace throughout the run, keeping in mind that you will exert a lot of energy in a full sprint at the end of the race.
Learn to run in runner traffic. People who run an 800m race will have to deal with runner traffic on the inside of the track. Train yourself to minimize being caught in the pack by running in groups to learn how to be conscious of your running form without clipping the person in front of you.
Run anaerobically. The last half (350-400 meters) of the race, your body will often feel fatigue from your almost sprint-like speed. Build this ability by sprinting 400m at a faster than normal pace; then walking for 2 minutes before repeating. This interval training will improve your anaerobic fitness.

, Run most days, alternating 400m and 1600m distances.


Focus on what attributes best match the 800m. Use the 400m to develop speed in sprinting. Use the 1600m to develop a high-speed endurance pace.
Refer to your training schedule. Remember to take rest days to stretch and continue eating a healthy diet to fuel for your next run. Also go on runs that will train your body in different ways, like hill running to improve leg muscles and cardiovascular strengthening.

, Always follow hard days with easier days. After a hard workout, give your body time to recover by either resting or doing a lighter workout.


While you typically want to be somewhat active on rest days, you also need to allow your body to truly rest. This means that you get enough sleep and keep a consistent sleep schedule.Don’t run on an injury. If you experience an injury, stop training, and see a doctor so you don’t injure yourself further.

, An hour before the race, have a high-carbohydrate snack and 16 ounces (450 g) of water.


You want to give your body the right nutrition to energize, but you don’t want to overdo it by eating too much. Before running, eat a snack instead of a whole meal as that means fewer calories your body has to try and process during your race.Consider fruit or yogurt, or a cereal bar to give you energy without making you feel bloated and sluggish.

, Make sure that your body is loose and ready to run.


With a quick, proper stretch, you can loosen up your muscles and increase your stride while decreasing risk of injury and cramping during your run.
Stretch your hip flexors, thighs, hamstrings, calves, and lower back., A basic rule in middle distance races (800 and 1600 meters) is that a runner must maintain a fast pace and maintain enough energy to have two bursts of acceleration.


Start of the race off right. Run fast at a speed that you can maintain well. Consistency is key here.
Be smart in the middle of the race. Be conscious of the other runners and your changes in pace. You will need the energy to sprint at the beginning and end of the race. Use the first acceleration to merge into the inner lanes and get as close to the front of the pack as you can.
Be conscious of when you are over exerting yourself so that you have enough energy for the second acceleration at the end of the race. You want to maintain a consistent pace until it’s time to accelerate; don’t let other runners affect your pace.
In the last 200m or 300m, begin to sprint at full pace. This is where the anaerobic training comes in. Push your body, using your last acceleration to pass the pack leaders and win the race.

, Properly cooling down after your run is just as important as your training. A proper cool will prevent injury and help ease your body back into a normal state.Walk for a couple of minutes, starting at a brisker pace then transitioning to a slower walk to allow your heart to ease back into its normal rhythm.
Stretch again for 5-10 minutes to ensure that your muscles don’t tighten up too much from working so hard.

You don't want to begin running as fast as you can or you might burn out before you finish the mile. You should be jogging at a slow and easy pace for the first minute or so of your mile.;
, Running a mile should take new runners about 10 to 12 minutes. If you are running on a standard track, try to complete the first lap in around 3 minutes. A mile is 4 laps on a standard track.Completing each lap in around 3 minutes will give you a good pace for your mile.

, The key to running a long distance is to pace your run so that you don't burn out before you're finished. You should run the mile at an easy speed that isn't too exhausting for you. You should be able to keep your breathing steady throughout your entire run, so if you find yourself breathing harder, you need to slow down your pace.By running at a steady pace, you'll be able to speed up your pace slowly with each mile you run.
Keep a consistent pace as you complete each of the laps around the track.

, Saying positive affirmations to yourself while you run is a great way to stay motivated and make the run seem easier. Try thinking encouraging thoughts to yourself, or actually say them out loud.


Use positive affirmations like, ""you can do it"", ""you're doing great"", ""you're amazing"", or ""you're getting so healthy"".
You can also say phrases that focus on what you've accomplished like, ""you're halfway done"", ""almost to the finish line"", or ""one more quarter""., As you are running your fourth and final lap of your mile, try to increase your pace slightly. When you are running a mile starting slow and finishing strong and fast will allow you to use your energy most effectively.Set a visual goal to run towards, such as a bench or a tree, and run faster until you reach the object. Slow down for a stretch and then pick a new visual target.

, Find something to reward yourself with for accomplishing the goal of running a mile. Associating finishing the run with a reward will help you stay motivated when you want to run another mile. Consider rewards like new running clothes or accessories, a fun night out, or an item you've been wanting like a new book.

, You should always begin a workout by warming up your muscles. Spend 5-10 minutes stretching your muscles and then walking lightly to get the blood flowing in your muscles. Dynamic stretching, such as lunges and leg lifts, is more effective than static stretching. Walk at a slower pace for a warm up.

, The first step to training for a mile run is to start completing 20 minute cardio workouts composed of walking and jogging. The 20 minute walk/run cardio sessions should be broken down into intervals that start with mostly walking and end up with mostly running. Try using the intervals listed here or make your own interval plan.Week 1: Jog 1 minute, Walk 4 minutes, Repeat 4 times
Week 2: Jog 2 minutes, Walk 3 minutes, Repeat 4 times
Week 3: Jog 3 minutes, Walk 2 minutes, Repeat 4 times
Week 4: Jog 4 minutes, Walk 1 minute, Repeat 4 times.

, It’s important to take some days to rest your body and let your muscles recuperate from the hard work they are doing. You should aim to have 1 to 2 rest days throughout the week.


For example, you can exercise Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, rest Wednesday, exercise Thursday and Friday, and then rest on Saturday.

, When you are first starting to run, switch between running and walking as you train.Walking gives your body some time to recover from the stresses of running.
As you increase your endurance, run for longer periods and walk for shorter amounts of time.

, Use a treadmill, go to a track, or map out a trail to measure a one mile course. Run the length of the mile, keeping a steady pace. The first time you run, you shouldn’t worry about the time it takes you. Focus on running the entire mile.


When starting out running a mile, begin on flat ground. Hills and uneven terrain make running more difficult. A treadmill or a standard track are great places for beginners.
The cushioned surface of a track lightens the impact on a runner's joints. Visit local high schools to use the track when school is not in session.

, In order to decrease the time it takes you to run one mile, try building endurance for longer distance runs. Once you are able to run one mile consistently without stopping or walking, try to increase your distance gradually to 1.5, 2, or 3 miles.Running longer distances will allow you to build endurance and increase your body's ability to run a single mile faster.

, In order to complete races or competitive runs, you will want to shorten the time it takes you to run a mile. A regular running routine will help you build endurance and improve the speed of your mile.Set a specific training schedule. Stick to your schedule, and run everyday that you schedule yourself to practice.
Sprint 1 lap around the track as fast as you can with a 1 minute rest time. Repeat the sprint and rest gradually decreasing the rest time between sprints.

, To have good technique, you need to wear the right shoes for your feet. There are different types of running shoes designed for different types of feet. For example, flat footed runners do better with a high stability shoe, and runners with a high arch will need a cushioned shoe with mid sole padding. Most runners also need a running shoe about a half size larger than their dress shoe. Go to a sports shoe store to get help picking a running shoe. You also need to wear flexible exercise clothing to run in. Clothing that is breathable will help your body cool off as you run.Make sure your clothes are seasonally appropriate.

, When you run you should breath in a rhythm to help your body take full deep breaths. Try using the 2:1 breathing method to train yourself to breathe rhythmically. Breath in for 2 strides and then breath out for 1 stride. Continue this rhythm as you run your mile. Many people like the 2:1 stride method, but some feel more comfortable at 3:1 or another ratio. Find what works for you., Many runners use up a lot of energy twisting their upper body while they run. This is energy that could help you run faster or longer, so getting rid of the habit of twisting your upper body while you run is a good idea. To do this, think of where a zipper would be on a jacket you’re wearing. The zipper creates a line down the center of your upper body. If your hands or arms cross over that line while you run, you’re twisting your upper body.Hold your arms slightly wider than your hips. When you swing your arms back imagine them reaching back towards your back pocket.This will help keep your arms moving in a straight line and not across your body.

, Standing tall with your shoulders pulled back will help you breath deeper as you run. Deeper breaths get more oxygen into your lungs and keep you from getting tired too quickly. When you run with your shoulders pulled back, running will feel easier to you., To have good running form, you need to have short, light steps that don’t have your feet extending too far from your body. Try to have your knee up at a 90 degree angle from the ground before you step your foot down. If you want to run faster, increase the amount of steps you take rather than the length of your stride., Many beginners don’t pay attention to how their foot is hitting the ground and end up striking the ground with their heel as they run. Heel striking can lead to injuries and typically slows down a runner. Pay attention to what part of your foot is hitting the ground when you run. You want to aim for the middle to front of your foot. This may take some getting used to if you are naturally a heel striker."
"
Calculate your cadence.,
Increase your cadence gradually with interval training.,
Increase the interval at which you run your new cadence.,
Use a metronome.",How to Run a Faster 1500M2," Set your watch to one minute and run at a normal pace. As you run, count the number of times your left or right foot hits the ground. When the timer stops, multiply this number by two.For example, if your right foot hit the ground 80 times, then your cadence is 160 steps per minute (spm).

, In your run, incorporate 20-second intervals of running that are five percent faster than your normal cadence. If your normal cadence is 160 spm, for example, then incorporate an interval of 20 seconds at 168 spm during your regular run. After 20 seconds, slow back down to your normal pace.Practice this three to five times a week.

, Once you are comfortable running 20-second intervals, increase them by 15 seconds. If you ran for an interval of 20 seconds at 168 spm during week one, for example, then increase the interval to 35 seconds of 168 spm during week two. Repeat this until you can run the whole minute at 168 spm.
Once you are comfortable running at your new cadence, then increase it by another five percent and repeat the process over again.

, A metronome will help you find your rhythm while you run. Set the metronome to your desired beats per minute, for example 160 bpm if your cadence is 160 spm. Keep your running rhythm in tune with the metronome."
"
Establish a position in the second or third lane.,
Maintain a steady pace.,
Accelerate your pace.",How to Run a Faster 1500M3," When you start the race, it is important to establish a position in one of the outside lanes. Staying in the second or third lane will prevent you from getting boxed in, which typically happens when you run in the first lane.Make sure to position yourself near the front of the pack as well.

, During the middle of the race, position yourself behind the leaders and maintain a steady pace. This way, if you are running against the wind, the leaders’ bodies will block most of it, helping you to conserve energy.Additionally, make sure to pay attention to the leaders. Only speed up your pace if the leaders speed up their pace.

, When you have 300 meters left to run, accelerate your pace. Once you hit the 200-meter mark, accelerate to an all-out sprint. If you are behind the leaders at this point, then move yourself to an outside lane and propel yourself forward to get ahead. Maintain your speed until you reach the finish line.Make sure you stay in the second or third lane at the 300-meter mark to avoid getting boxed in.

First, make sure you are in good shape.,
Once you're in shape and have a track meet coming up, it's time to start preparing for the race.

,
Figure out what time you want to be running.,
Figure out your split times.,
A couple nights before, visualize yourself running the race.,
The night before, eat a healthy dinner and drink a lot of water.

,
When you get to the starting line, just try to stay calm.,
In the first 400 meters, go out in a fast but controllable pace.

,
After 400 meters almost everyone slows down.,
Once you've run 800 meters, you're really almost done.,
You can start your kick now.,
When you've finished with the third lap, you just have 300 meters left.,
With 100 meters left, give it everything you've got.",How to Run a Faster 1500 Meter," If you aren't already on it, then join your school's track team. Those workouts will get you in good shape.;
,, If you haven't ran a 1500 before, either double your 800 time, subtract 20 or so seconds from your mile time, or cut in half and subtract 40 seconds from your 3000 time. These are just approximate times though, as every person is different.

, Look on a race pace guide to find out where you want to be at at 400, 800, and 1200 meters.

, Imagine yourself running quickly but easily, with good form and breathing. Also picture yourself running the split times that you wanted to.

,, Tell yourself that you are prepared for this race.

,, Make sure you add in a surge there—you can also try to sprint up to catch the next person. Make sure you do this even though it might seem to soon, but if you don't you'll run a far slower race.

, It helps to just concentrate on running 100 meters, then you just have a lap and a half left.

, Concentrate on just catching up to the person in front of you, and passing them.

, If you aren't already, you should be sprinting by now. Block out all the pain, and remind yourself that everybody else is just as tired as you are.

, Future careers are made and broken here, and you don't want to ever be saying ""What if?"" about the race.

Stick with it.",How to Run a Fast Half Mile," Before you build speed, you need to build the endurance that will let you run the full half mile. Add sprinting into your regular running regimen to start building endurance.


Start with smaller distances, such as 100-meters, and work your way up. You might also start at 200 or 400 meters, depending on your experience.
Practice sprinting only after you’ve sufficiently warmed up by jogging or running first.Practice sprinting drills to supplement your practice sprints. Try walking on your toes for 20 to 30 meters, followed by walking on your heels for another 20 to 30 meters. Exercises that stretch the legs and develop range of movement are also effective for helping build endurance.;
, Strengthening your core and leg muscles is important in order to keep proper form while running. Strong leg muscles also increase your pushing power when taking off, as well as your overall speed.


Rather than working your legs at the gym, perform some physical activities that improve your muscles while working other parts of your body as well.
Tuck jumps are performed by squatting low to the ground, and suddenly jumping into the air as high as you can, while bringing your knees to your chest while airborne.
Performing skips and focusing on either going as high or as far as possible also builds muscle and cardio strength., In order to get a good half mile time, you must have a lot of speed. You should start to incorporate speed workouts into your routine after a couple weeks of simple endurance workouts. There are a few important steps to training for speed.


Record a baseline. Record your initial speed for a typical run so you can measure your progress. You can record your base speed on a variety of race/track types.

, Mix a variety of hill runs into your overall training schedule, roughly once or twice a week. Running uphill will build the leg and cardio strength you need to improve your overall speed. Be careful not to injure yourself while running the hills. Relax and don’t push yourself too hard.


Start simple with simple “green hill” runs. Run only fast enough to work your cardio so that you can hear your breathing. Run easy on the way up the hill, and fast on the way down. Repeat for 10-15 minutes.
Move on to “red hill” runs when you are feeling ready. This run focuses on building strength – instead of easy on the way up and fast on the way down the hill, you want to run hard up the hill, and regain your strength on the way down. Take care, and repeat for 10-15 minutes., Look to your local college or high school for available tracks – most are open to the public. Tracks are great for gauging your progress, as they are flat and already measured for distance.


Stay out of the outermost left lane unless you are running for speed; this is where the faster athletes do their runs.
For the purposes of training, know that on a standard track, 800 meters is about 2 laps around the track., Write down your times in your running journal. Use this journal to track your progress, and push your speed faster as you feel more comfortable with the run. Frequently review your journal to keep yourself motivated.As your performance improves, don't be afraid to update your goals with something more difficult.
Keep more than just your running times in your journal, such as your heart rate, stretches performed that day, and type of running. This helps track your overall health, as well as the evolution of your training regiment., Muscle mass and power are both important for sprinters. A strong diet should cater to these attributes by focusing on carbohydrates and protein. Foods high in these supplements work together to help build muscle.


During training, focus on getting between 1.2 and 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Similarly, aim for 5 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight.
During the day of the race, eat a balance of carbs and proteins three to four hours prior to the race.
Chicken, turkey, yogurt and baked potatoes are a few examples of food items great for supplementing muscle growth., Posture and form is just as important to good run times as muscle training. Make sure your form is not inhibiting your run times. Practice good form just as you would any other aspect of training.


Keep your head still and in line with your spine, while keeping your jaw and neck muscles relaxed.
Shoulders should also be relaxed. Your shoulders should help guide your upper-body movement.
Keep arm movements smooth and lock your elbows at a 65 degree angle.
Record your runs or have a friend observe your technique to understand where your posture may be lacking., Dynamic warmups involves moving through a range of motions repeatedly for a set number of repetitions. Unlike static warmups, dynamic stretching more closely resembles the range of motion that can be expected from physical activities.


Walking high knees work out the gluteal muscles. Perform them by walking in a straight line, while picking up your knees as high as you can during each step.
”Toy Soldiers” or “Frankensteins” work out the hamstrings. Perform them by standing straight and holding your arms above your head. Lift one leg out in front of you horizontally, and bring the opposite hand to meet it, touching your toe. Alternate for each side.Lower back, hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, Achilles, and rotator cuffs are all important areas to focus on when building flexibility for sprinting.

, Static stretching lengthens muscles through holding a particular stretch in one position over a period of time. Static stretching is best suited for cooling down periods, as they don’t work the same range of motion as dynamic stretching, and may inhibit sprinting performance.”The Hamstring Stretch” does just that – slowly stretches the hamstring muscles in your leg. Place one leg on a low stool with your hips and feet facing forward. Lean forward from your hips while keeping your back flat and knee straight, until you feel a stretch in the back of the thigh.
”The Quadriceps Stretch” stretches the quad muscles in your leg. Simply bend your leg at the knee toward the back of your thigh and grab your ankle. Keep your back straight and your bent knee in line with your hip. Gently pull your ankle toward your buttocks until you feel a stretch in the front of your thigh., Get out on a track and perform as though you were actually running the race. You want to put the training you’ve been doing into real world practice. Make all the preparations you would as though it were the actual day of the race.


Bring a friend along to observe your performance. They can give you a heads up on where you slowed down, where you did well, and how your posture looked.
Make sure you time your efforts using a stop watch and record them in your journal.
Practice 3 to 4 weeks before the actual day of the race to give you a good idea of how you can expect to perform on race day., The start of the race can have an impact on how you end up finishing the race. You want to get yourself into a comfortable pace within the first 20 to 30 meters of the race. Be aggressive to reach that pace as soon as possible.Try to reach the middle of the racing pack from the start to avoid getting caught up in the slower runners.
Push hard early to take advantage of your lactic energy system. This energy system provides between 7 and 8 seconds of energy at the start of a race, and if you don't push hard within that time, that energy is lost., Break down your overall goal of running a faster 800-meter race into smaller pieces. This makes practicing and training easier to process.


Check your times at the 200 and 400-meter marks. Your 200-meter timing should be a few seconds faster than the 400-meter timing.
Successful 800-meter runs involve running the first 400 meters at around 90 to 93 percent of your best 400 time., In the first few races you participate in, you will probably not get the time that you are really capable of. Keep working hard and set personal goals for yourself. A good mindset and visualization will help lower your times.Be social. Talk to the other runners and compare goals, experiences, and disappointments. By making friends, you will find people who will push you to do your best.
Keep your goals reasonable. If your current goal seems too difficult to achieve, focus on getting halfway there. This keeps your goals achievable and gives you a sense of progression that you might have lacked before."
"
Do intervals.,
Do endurance running.,
Work on your 1⁄4 and 1⁄2 mile (0.4 and 0.8 km).,
Shave off mere seconds each time.,
Crosstrain.,
Run differently.,
Look to your form.,
Run with music.,
Run with someone faster than you.,
Figure out a plan.,
Set target goals.,
Keep a log.,
Get good running shoes.,
Eat right.,
Stay hydrated.,
Sleep.,
Take care of your body.",How to Run a 7 Minute Mile," One of the best things you can do for your distance time is to run in intervals. That means that the next time you go for your run, cycle between 60 seconds of a leisurely jog and 30 seconds of flat out booking it like you're running from the feds. As you get used to this, knock down that 60 second break time to 50, 40, and then 30, when you're running at a 1:1 ratio.


Similar to interval training is Fartleks (that's Swedish) or speed-work (it's like long-term interval training).On certain days, try to allot 20% of your running time for speed-work purposes. Here's a quick example of effective speed work:

Spend the first 4-5 minutes just running at your normal pace
Run the next 10 minutes kicked up a notch (ideally at a pace of 7.5min / mile)
Spend the next 60 seconds running as fast as your legs will take you
Then slowly and carefully work yourself back down to your normal pace
Continue this program expanding the speed-work by 15-second (or 30 second) increments

;
, You'll soon find here that keeping your body guessing is imperative to increasing your speed. Running 1 mile (1.6 km) as fast as you can go is good, but being used to running 3 will do you favors, too. When you're used to running 3, 5, 7 miles, telling yourself to run just 1 at a faster rate is easy peasy.


Work yourself up slowly if you haven't been doing endurance, long-distance running. Aim for running around 5 days a week, dedicating a day or two to running longer instead of faster. Up your distance each week by 1/2 a mile if you can.

, Running a mile is a chore. But running 1/2 a mile or even 1/4? That's child's play. You could run 1/4 of a mile way faster if you knew that was all you had to run, right? So start there. When you go all out for 1/2 a mile, you have way more wiggle room for the second leg.


You don't have to increase your pace for the entire mile to shave off time. Running 1/4 of mile at nearly-all-out speeds can take away seconds on the final time of an otherwise ordinary run. Just make sure you don't strain yourself running too hard initially!

, Having a goal of losing even 30 seconds can seem lofty and daunting. Instead of setting goals that seem out of reach, aim for losing 1 or 2 seconds every time you run. When the finish line is in sight, you'll feel that blast of motivation that propels you just that much faster. Your body will go faster without you even realizing it.


This is an effect that will only be felt over time. Days will pass and you won't feel like you're getting anywhere until one day you wake up and a minute is gone from your mile. It will take some patience and trust, but the effect will accumulate.

, Nobody ever got fit doing one thing and one thing alone. To be at your body's peak aerobic fitness, you need to work it across all playing fields. That means running, biking, swimming, boxing, basketball, jumping rope -- whatever you can get your hands on. Working different muscle groups different ways will give you that edge that your mile times have been lacking.


Ever thought about doing a triathlon? Swimming and biking are two great skills to master in addition to being able to pound block after block of pavement. Consider it on the bucket list!

, How? Well, it doesn't really matter. Just switching it up will do your body good. Need some ideas?


Run hills. You know what it feels like to run on flat terrain after a hill? Like a piece of cake, that's what.
Run different tracks or trails. Different surfaces, different inclines, different everything -- it all can affect your running game.
Run at different times of day. Your body may actually be faster at morning or at night.
Run different ways. Switch up between interval training, speed work, and long-distance running.

, If all else fails -- you've been running hills, doing Fartleks, rocking the long-distance runs and nothing is working -- take a look at your form. Maybe you're literally not running efficiently. Here are a few things to consider:


Do you keep your eyes focused ahead of you, head up? Looking up or down can put strain on your neck and back.
Are your arms tense? If you ever notice them being flexed and not loose, give them a quick shake. They should be held at a 90 degree angle, propelling your body forward as they move back and forth.
Good running is quiet running. Your feet should strike around your heel and roll onto your toes, calves moving you onto the next step. They should land directly beneath you and feel light and springy.How's your breathing? If you're breathing from your chest, you're wasting energy.Make sure you're breathing from your gut, or diaphragm. Your stomach should be expanding with each intake of breath.

, Sounds too easy to be true, but it works. When you're getting ready for a run, you may want to have music categories for different distances. When you're running and hear a song, you'll know if you're on track or if you need to change your pace. Start off with some of your favorite upbeat songs, and have the beat increase as time goes on so that you continue to be motivated.


Jog.fm has a number of great songs that are perfect for 7-minute miles.You'll find yourself falling in stride with the music, unable to break the beat even if you wanted. A playlist that is at 100% speed can provide the just-right environment you need to power through.

, If you don't know anyone faster than you, join a local running club or triathlon club, you'll meet plenty of fast runners. As you're running behind them, follow their pace and watch their movement and legs...without realizing it your rhythm and pace will match theirs and make your strides longer and pace faster.


But not super faster than you. Watching someone lap you is just frustrating. You want to aim for a friend that's about 30 seconds faster than you are -- not much more, not much less.

, So often we'd like to do things with ourselves and that liking to do things just isn't strong enough. We need to set ourselves out on a path that we can't deviate from. So figure yours out! How many times a week are you willing to run? What days and when? What kind of running? What will you do?


A weight loss plan might not hurt, either. Losing even 5 pounds can put a bit more pep in your step. If there's some wiggle room in your diet (that is, you could make some improvements), consider this idea. The lighter you are, the easier it is for your body to carry you.

, Look to decrease your mile time by a set amount of seconds each week until you reach your goal of 7 minutes. Start every run by saying if it's a Maintenance Run, Challenge Run or an ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" Run. Setting expectations for yourself will encourage you to run with a purpose in mind, not wanting to break your promises.


A Maintenance Run means you're running just for the sake of getting some exercise. Feelin' good, blowing off some steam, releasing endorphins and the like.
A Challenge Run is great when you've had a stressful day and have lots of energy (channel that energy to your run). Aim to knock off somewhere around 15-30 seconds every mile.
An ""I'm Feeling Lucky Run"" is just that — a rare day where everything has fallen in the right place. Use this excitement to try to beat your own personal record. Decide and plan your run before and finish it with the goal you had. The motivation to prove to yourself how awesome you are may take you through to the finish line.

, Because these awesome things you're doing deserve to written down. That and you'll forget one of those numbers you pegged last week and wonder what the heck your goal should be for the next day. And in a year's time you can look and see how many thousands of miles you've run. Awesome.


Seeing the numbers concretely will show you just what you're capable of, what you've already motivated yourself to do, and where the next feasible step is. You'll make so much progress that breaking stride won't even seem like an option.

, Running shoes should fit you well. Running is a very repetitive motion, and even the slightest discomfort will slow you down. In addition, continued use of ill-fitting running shoes can cause injuries such as plantar fasciitis, heel problems, and back pain. The extra $75 is definitely worth it.


If you can spring for it, go to a specialty shop that can get you a shoe that's perfect for your foot. They'll take a look at the structure of your feet, your running style, and be able to hand you the shoe that will be your runner's golden slipper.

, Since you're burning so many calories, it's 100% necessary your diet is in order (especially right before a run). A runner's diet should consist of mainly fruits and veggies (skin on, if possible), lean meats, and dairy products. The more color and the more whole (and the less processed), the better.


If we're getting specific, dairy products from animals, fish, and anything that's related to a seed or has seeds is great, too.And, of course, refuel after your runs as well. Your muscles need to repair themselves!
Though it shouldn't be a staple of your diet like the aforementioned foods, look into energy gels like Gu. It's a blast of sugar and energy that can give you that zip you've been looking for, even if it is temporary.

, If you're running long distances and/or running all out, the importance of staying hydrated cannot be stressed enough. The absolute last thing you want to happen is your body passed out on the sidewalk, just waiting for a stranger to take you to the hospital. Alright, fine -- that's a worst case scenario. Best case dehydration scenario? Your metabolism shuts down and your muscles stop working. Thanks, but not thanks.


Always, always, always have a water bottle with you. If it's cumbersome, get a belt that carries it around your waist. A 7-minute mile is serious business and you've got to be serious about it if you want to succeed. Seriously healthy, too.
Don't pressure yourself to finish the bottle. Only drink when you're thirsty. Current research says that not drinking enough liquids and drinking too much liquids (yep, that's a thing) can both wreak havoc on your system., And by that we mean a solid 7 hours, if not a bit more. Sleep is as important to your body as air is to your lungs. Don't get enough and your body will suffer and fatigue. You can get less and survive, but don't expect your runs to be impressive.


In general, keep the caffeine to the morning. Don't pound that can of Mountain Dew prior to your late-night run. A little can get you going and can actually be good for your time, but too much can be detrimental.

, If you are injured, don't continue running. You are just exacerbating the problem and guaranteed that you'll be down for the count much, much longer. So listen to yourself. If you start hurting, stop. It's not worth it. It's not worth spending the next few weeks on the couch, unable to train.


If you're a serious athlete (which you probably are), you know how important it is to warm up beforehand and stretch after. Be sure to allot time for both of these in your running regimen to prevent injury.

Your head should be relaxed with a slightly lowered chin, but your eyes should be up and alert.
Shoulders should be back which should thrust your chest into a slightly taller position. When running, your chest should be tall, but not overextended in front of you.;
, Dynamic stretches are warm up moves that also limber up your body. These can be added to your warm up laps, or you can dynamically stretch after your lap work. There are many dynamic stretches you might use when warming up, but a few to consider include:


Front lunges
Reverse lunges
High steppers (also called high knees), where you raise your knees as high as possible while jogging or at a light run.
Butt kickers, where you kick your feet toward your butt each time one passes behind you., If you know that you have tricky muscle group that gives you issues if you don’t stretch it out thoroughly, you should specifically devote some time to these areas. Some common problem areas are calves, thighs, and butt., Of course, you shouldn’t take any illegal performance enhancing substances, which can be dangerous to your health. However, some runners take energy gel caps to give themselves a legal boost. You should also drink a little bit of water, but you probably shouldn’t drink any more than an 8 oz glass.


Drinking too much water before your race can affect your performance and may even cause you to get sick during or after the race.
Avoid overloading on carbs the night before. Instead, you should eat reasonable portions of carbs, like pasta, several days before your race.
Wake up a little earlier than usual and eat a leisurely, balanced breakfast several hours before your race to sustain your energy levels., The inside two lanes are the strongest positioning due to the fact these give an advantage in the turns of the race. After you receive your start signal, you should run the first 10 to 20 meters at a pace a little faster than normal. As soon as you are able to get to the inside two lanes without impeding anyone, do so.

Lane one, the innermost lane, is the lane with the best advantage. You should stick in lane one whenever possible.
If your race makes use of a staggered start for runners, also called a waterfall start, make your way to the inside lanes as soon as possible., Runners get “boxed in” when they are surrounded by others and cannot break free of the grouping without changing their rhythm. Getting boxed in early can lead to your best pace being hindered by other runners. There is also the risk that other runners may intentionally hedge you into a less favorable position for later in the race., Off the blocks, you and the other runners will likely be at a slightly faster pace than normal. This is a result of adrenaline and is completely normal, though you should be careful not to overexert yourself. Doing so can create difficulty for you later in the race when your energy starts flagging.


Though you don’t want to be caught up in the adrenaline rush and burn yourself out on the first lap, you should also be careful that the pack does not pull too far ahead of you.
Your first 400 m, which is also your first lap, should be no faster than four or five seconds under your target splits.
Your split time is your total time for any point during your run. In a mile race your split times might look like 1:05, 2:10, 3:15 and 4:20 for each lap. Split times gauge your time according to specified waypoints (turns, miles, laps), as though your run had ended there.
Remember to stay in lane one whenever possible. , You should relax into the second lap after your quick first lap. In lap two, you’ll want to ease into your race pace and prepare yourself for the remainder of the race, which is the more strenuous half of the 1600 m. Keep your form tight and take steady, measured breaths., If you aim to make a 4:20 minute mile, it may help you to escalate your speed with regard to turns. Your first lap (which is made up of two turns) was likely a little fast, probably about the pace of a 4:00 minute mile, or a 1:00 minute split. Lap two you should ease up, but by the time you go into your third turn, you should be at a 4:10 minute pace. In your fourth turn, you’ll want to be back at a 4:00 minute mile pace.


Your second lap should be significantly slower than your first, but not so slow that the pack pulls too far ahead of you.

, You’ll want to read runners as they surge, but you shouldn’t be afraid of to surge yourself. Boxing out other runners at this point can put you in better positioning for the end of the race. Keep your surge short to conserve energy and prevent your body from slipping into the anaerobic zone.


Limit any surge you do at this point to a maximum distance of 20 m. Any farther and you run the risk of inducing your body’s anaerobic response. You’ll want to save anaerobic effort for later in the race., Lap three will be the most mentally challenging part of your 1600 m race. This is because you can’t kick your pace into high gear yet, but since you’re already half a mile into the race, your body will be hurting. You should begin to gain on other runners at this point. Conserve your energy, but close gaps and pass everyone you can without pushing yourself too hard.Control your breathing. You will be breathing heavily at this point, but you shouldn’t be gasping out of control.
Lap three is oftentimes the slowest lap. Aim for your pace to be two or three seconds above race pace, maximum.
Your split for your third lap should be 1:08, which is the slowest possible to keep you a contender for finishing your mile at a respectable 4:20 minute pace.

, A good tactic at this point will be for you to set your focus on a runner ahead of you. Start your acceleration as soon as you cross into the final lap. The first 100 m should be taken in a stride. Keep your elbows at 90º and pump your arms parallel to the track.


When the first place runner crosses the start line into the final lap, also called the bell lap, a signal will be given, like a gunshot.
Your head position should be straight with your chin in a slightly downward position and your eyes up and focused.
Keep your shoulders back to keep your posture strong and your chest tall. You’ll want to be light on your feet and you should keep your knees up., Visualize yourself boosting at each 100 m mark to help you achieve your best effort. You should feel a wave of adrenaline at about the 1400 m mark; use this to your advantage to push your speed to the limit in the last 200 m.


In the last 100 m, you should be running at your top speed. Keep your form tight and clean; sloppiness is common due to exhaustion.
Your final lap should be almost as fast, if not faster, than your first lap., Now that you’ve finished your race and pushed yourself to the limit, your heart rate should be accelerated and your breathing labored. You’ll need to take some time to get your wind back. Give yourself a few minutes and walk a lap to calm your body.

, Bending at the waist is a common response after an all-out, pell-mell race, but this can lead to feelings of nausea and can cause vomiting. Additionally, laying down or assuming a sitting/collapsed body position can cause lactic acid to pool in your muscles, which will create more muscular soreness later.

, Now that you’re feeling a little less haggard, you should take a light jog for a lap minimum, though you might want take a few laps for the best results. Your cool down jog should be comparable to your warm up.


Both your warm up and cool down are intended to gradually prepare for physical activity or relax them afterwards. This helps prevent the damage sometimes caused by abrupt and extreme changes in activity., Some individuals sweat more than others, but after you’ve heated up for the race, run the race, and cooled down, it’s likely you’ve been sweating pretty consistently for at least 20 minutes. This is a considerable amount of lost moisture that you’ll need to replace. Once you feel well enough, you should drink some warm water to rehydrate.


Warm water is gentler on your system and won’t cause your stomach to spasm or clench uncomfortably. These sensations in your stomach can lead to nausea or vomiting if you’re not careful.
Your body will also have lost electrolytes, which are important minerals your body needs to function. The primary electrolytes you’ll need to be concerned with replenishing are sodium (salt) and potassium.
Sodium replacement tablets are an excellent resource for serious runners, but regular salt can also be dissolved in water, salty snacks consumed, or raw salt eaten to restore your body’s sodium levels.
Potassium can be restored through eating certain potassium rich foods, like bananas, avocadoes, and beans., Your body has limbered up considerably over the course of your warm up, race, and cool down. This means that you will be at a higher risk for overstretching. To avoid overstretching, take a relaxed approach to your cool down stretch."
"
For the first two weeks, rest.,
Get more iron in your diet.,
Incorporate a daily dose of vitamin C into your diet.,
Alternatively, consider taking iron and vitamin C supplements.,
Eat more dairy products for calcium.,
Make sure you're getting a balanced diet.,
Consider seeing a physiotherapist.,
If your doctor put you on pain medicine, don't jump right back into running when the pain fades.,
Be patient.,
After the first week or two, resume very mild exercise.,
Maintain your fitness.,
Assess yourself for mild pain before getting back to running.,
Start from small runs and gradually increase it every 3 weeks.,
Apply an ice pack after activity if you experience mild pain.,
Don't force anything.,
Understand what a stress fracture is as opposed to other injuries.,
Know what symptoms to look for.,
If you have any of these symptoms, visit your doctor.",How to Return to Running After a Stress Fracture," Immediately following a fracture, complete rest is advised. During this time, the pain and swelling will be at their maximums since the fracture is still fresh – any further stress will almost certainly worsen it.


Rest does not mean you have to stay on a bed and live like a couch potato. Rest simply means avoid doing strenuous activities that can add workload in your bones and muscles. Avoid high impact exercises such as lifting weights and heavy objects.
If the injury is more severe, your doctor and physiotherapist may ask you to use crutches to move around in order to avoid weight-bearing on the bone. It is important that you rest properly and do not walk or bear weight on the leg at any sign of relief in pain that you might have due to the painkillers.;
, Iron is an essential part of red blood cell production. Red blood cells are produced by the bone marrow inside the bone, which is why you need iron for fast recovery. It also helps in increasing iron storage in the body known as ferritin. You can get more iron by eating:


Clams
Oysters
Animal liver
Nuts
Beans
Whole grains
Tofu.

, Vitamin C also plays an important role in bone repair as it is responsible for manufacturing collagen, which forms the connective tissues, bones, cartilage and ligaments. Here are some good sources of this vitamin:


Oranges
Lemons
Kiwi
Kale
Guava
Yellow bell peppers

, You need to take iron simultaneously with vitamin C because vitamin C increases the rate of absorption of iron in the body. If your diet doesn't allow you to intake these foods, consider taking a supplement. Taking 10mg of iron and 500mg of vitamin C daily is enough.


Talk to your doctor before changing your diet seriously, however. Certain supplements may not be safe or healthy for you.

, Dairy products like milk contain a lot of calcium. As you probably know from your elementary school days, calcium is very helpful in maintaining bone health and growth, so drinking a few glasses of milk every day will do wonders to make sure your body has the right amount of calcium in it.


Stick to low-fat products so you don't inadvertently cause a spike in your blood pressure or cholesterol. Go for natural cheeses, low-fat milk, low-fat yogurt, and low-fat cottage cheeses.

, To avoid potential acidity and heartburn as side-effects to your pain medications, be sure to get a healthy, balanced diet. Concentrate on getting more fruits and vegetables as these have plenty of essential vitamins and minerals that will ultimately enhance your bone healing process as well as your overall health.You can also take fish oil supplements and multivitamin supplements that are perfectly safe, so long as you talk to your doctor about which ones you're taking and how much. Too much of a good thing isn't healthy either.

, Depending on the severity of your injury, your doctor will refer you to a physiotherapist who will then ideally be able to design and chalk out the best method for you. This could be anything from pain medication and strengthening exercises to a splint or crutches.


There aren’t any special exercises as such that are designed for stress fracture recovery. The key lies in the fact that you should maintain a fine balance between overburdening your foot and optimally helping your recovery with activity. Seeking a professional will help you find this balance.

, If the fracture is localised and smaller in nature, your orthopedic doctor may not put you in a splint or a cast. He may just prescribe you a few anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or tramadol in cases of severe pain. However, caution must be taken before you immediately decide to start running at the moment your pain subsides as a result of the medications. Remember: the pain isn't gone – it's just masked by the medicine. You still need to stay off your leg.


A stress fracture can take anywhere between 5-8 weeks to heal, so it is very important that you do not rush into things as this can in fact worsen your condition, ultimately delaying the healing process.
It is important to note that slight weight-bearing activities 2-3 weeks after your injury can, in a way, stimulate the healing process, but yet again care must be taken guided with professional advice.

, Knowing that you have tiny breaks in your bone, you need to be patient as it takes time to heal the muscle and repair these breaks. It can take 2 weeks, 6 weeks, or as long as 12 weeks, depending on the gravity of your situation. If you start running while minimal pain is present, it will not help at all – rather it will put you at risk in having a serious bone fracture.

, After this period, the swelling and pain will naturally reduce. During this phase, it is advisable that you begin slow. Jogging and swimming are great exercises that can help you maintain your cardio exercises without putting the full strain on your feet again.


But before you beginning your resumption of any form of exercise, always ask your doctor who will then check you up and give you an all-clear.
If the swelling reduction has taken place to an extent that you can start seeing your skin creases again, this is a good sign indicating good healing.

, Before you resume with your running activities it is important to maintain your fitness by doing simple exercises such as aqua jogging, swimming, and biking. You can do these exercises for 3 to 4 times a week for 30 minutes. If you can’t tolerate any exercise don’t force yourself. Your body will tell you if it can tolerate the activity or not.


A very good exercise for injured runners is aqua jogging, the practice of trying to jog whilst your limbs are under water. For this, you need a floatation belt and aqua shoes which you will be able to find any sports shop. Aqua jogging will ensure that the force you endure from the water is not damaging to your bones, and likewise at the same time, you will still be able to burn those calories and maintain a good cardiovascular workout.

, Before you get back to your old active habits, you should try a trial run. However, even before that you should assess if there is still mild pain in your injured area. If pain is still present – even if it is only mild – do not go for that trial run. It can only worsen your condition as it may indicate that the bone is not yet completely healed.


The sooner you pick activity back up, the more you are putting yourself at risk. If you have rested for two weeks only, be prepared to have to wait a bit longer, if nothing else but to stay safe.

, You cannot run the usual distance that you are used to running. Point blank. Distance, frequency and duration should not be increased all at the same time. You can try increasing one or two but never increase all three to keep yourself healthy. Taking on too much can cause muscle and body intolerance since your body is not used to your old running activity.


It is advised and recommended that you alternate walking and running at the same time to get your muscles and body well-conditioned. You can have 3 running days every other week. Avoid running for 3-4 straight days as this can injure your muscles and bone. After 1 month you can run every 2 days with one day off. With this kind of set-up you can return to your old running style.

, If you have rested for 3 months and you experience minor pain after running, this doesn't mean you need to stop running again. It may actually be due to phantom pain.Just apply an ice pack for 15 minutes an hour to the area until the pain fades. If it fades, you're fine. It's just a minor inconvenience you'll have to deal with.


If the pain progresses and continues during the run you are advised to see your doctor. However if it was just a phantom pain, it will be sporadic (on and off) and vary in location and intensity during the run. This eventually wears off as you continue to run, so feel free to maintain a positive outlook in your running life.
Avoid fear and frequent thinking of bad memories as phantom pain has something to do with a person’s mentality. It may just be that pain was present due to psychological thinking.

, The next time you engage in long running activities it is better to take precautions to avoid stress fracture again. Look on the surface you are running. It is comfortable for your feet, ankles, and legs? And if you can no longer tolerate the exhaustion caused by running, it is better to stop and pause for a while to have rest. Better not to push yourself very hard as you don’t want a stress fracture to happen again.

, As the name says, a fracture that occurs due to repeated stress and strenuous forces on the bones are known as a stress fracture. Naturally, such constant forces are commonly noticeable in distance runners. They usually manifest as small, sometimes multiple, cracks in the bone, particularly the foot bones (called metatarsal bones) and other weight-bearing bones in the limbs.This condition can happen to any individual especially those who are physically active. When you walk the body absorb forces 2x your weight and when you run greater force is applied and received by your bones and body – that would be 2x the weight when you are walking. That’s why stress fractures happens &ndash because great repetitive forces are being absorbed by the body that the bone can no longer handle.

, Though there might not be significant symptoms present like in a case of a major fracture, a stress fracture would be characterised by the presence of a constant dull aching pain around the site of the fracture. This would get worse during exercise and sometimes even whilst walking or standing for prolonged periods of time. Swelling around the fracture area is also common.


Some people also experience tenderness, redness, and inflammation surrounding the injured area of the bone.

, For all stress fractures – from the minor the major – it is immediately advised that you go to your doctor. He will then examine you and ask for a CT scan or an MRI to be done.


A simple x-ray is sometimes not helpful in detecting a stress fracture due to the minute size of the cracks that may be present.
Stress fractures should not be left to your judgment. If these is pain, it needs to be treated by a professional.

Establish running goals.,
Get a physical examination if you currently suffer from health problems and conditions.,
Develop warm-up and stretching routines before and after running.,
Begin your run at a slow pace.,
Wear proper running clothing.,
Maintain your running shoes.,
Choose safe running venues.,
Run during safe weather conditions.",How to Prevent Injuries While Running," Setting running goals is important because it allows you to plan the most beneficial routine depending on your physique or desired running method. For example, if you are overweight and want to run to reduce body fat, you may want to begin with a steady walking pace or slow jog; whereas if you want to focus on cardiovascular exercise, you may want to run at quick paces to increase your heart rate. When setting goals, you may want to work with a professional coach or athletic trainer to determine the safest running routine that is aligned appropriately with your goals.;
, Since certain health problems may hinder your ability to run effectively or cause injuries, you may want to meet with a doctor or professional trainer beforehand. For example, people with asthma or breathing problems may want to consult with a professional before running to prevent injuries, as well as those with osteoporosis, arthritis, and other degenerative joint diseases.

, Warming up and stretching before you run is important because it will increase the blood flow to your muscles during your run. Stretching after running will also reduce soreness by removing lactic acid from your muscles, promoting better flexibility and helping you to relax. Just like running, warming up and stretching must be done properly to avoid injuries. Failing to stretch may result in injuries such as Achilles Tendinitis, which is marked by early morning stiffness, pain on the back of your tendon, or calf tightness, and Plantar Fasciitis, which is inflammation of your plantar fascia, the thick, fibrous band of tissue on the bottom of your foot.


Refrain from bouncing while you stretch. Bouncing may pull or tear the muscle you are trying to stretch or relax. To prevent injuries while stretching, stretch slowly and hold your stretch for about 30 to 40 seconds. By stretching slowly you will avoid a contraction reflex that occurs from stretching too quickly, allowing your muscle tension to decrease so you can stretch the muscle further. You must also stop stretching when you begin to feel tightness or pain to prevent injury.

, When easing into your running pace, begin at a brisk walk or slower jog for between 5 and 10 minutes to continue to warm up your muscles and joints. Doing so will make your body more pliable and help prevent injuries.

, By wearing appropriate running attire, you can regulate body heat and protect yourself against hazardous weather elements. Wear light, breathable clothing that prevents perspiration from building up and wear hats or ear covers to shield yourself from the sun or freezing weather to prevent frostbite. Running socks or thick socks are also very important to prevent your feet from getting blisters or experiencing irritation.

, Proper running shoes should always be comfortable with good support arches that fit your feet and should always be in good condition. Replace your running shoes every 2 to 3 months if you run regularly and if they have been worn too thin or are angled. Wearing tight, loose, or worn shoes may result in injuries such as twisted ankles or shin splints.

, Prevent injuries by avoiding steep hills and hard surfaces like pavement, which may cause shin splints. Instead, run on all-purpose track surfaces such as those found at schools or on treadmills.

, Running outdoors in high humidity or in temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius) may cause heat illnesses such as sunburn, dehydration and exhaustion, whereas running in cold or freezing temperatures may cause frostbite. If weather conditions are too harsh outside, run indoors or at a gym to prevent injuries.

Explode from the start.,
Accelerate for the first 100 meters.,
Maintain a steady sprint for the next 100 meters.,
Re-accelerate again at 200 meters.,
Use the correct technique.",How to Run 1600M Track Relay1," The opening of the race is incredibly important and contributes to the success of the relay. If you are the first runner in the relay, you will need to set the pace and tempo for the rest of your team.When you begin running, there will be a seven-second timeframe where your body will not have a buildup of lactic acid, and you can take advantage of this to gain speed without getting fatigued.Blast off as fast as you possibly can and then work on gaining more momentum as you run.


While it may seem like common sense to start slow and then build up speed, this is not the right tactic in the 400-meter relay. You should always be maintaining a speed that's close to a full sprint.
Train your balance and strength to build up your ability to explode out of the gate.Exercises like rocket jumps, truck jumps, lunge jumps, and forward weight throws will help build explosive power for when you need to take off.;
, The first 50-100 meters of your run will be an acceleration period. You should be right below your maximum sprinting speed.The goal here is to pick up enough speed before you go into a more controlled sprint which uses less energy. Don't fall behind the other runners during this stretch of the race.

, For the next 100 meters of the contest, you'll want to continue running at near max speed but conserve your energy. You can save your energy by reducing your arm's range of motion.Do not reduce your speed or go into a jog. The goal is to maintain the maximum running velocity while conserving your energy.

, When you hit 200 meters, you will undergo a rebuilding phase. Build your momentum back up to achieve your maximum speed. Sprint as fast as you possibly can for the last 100-150 meters of the race. In this phase, your body will begin to get tired and want to slow down, but you will lose the race if you do this.If you are behind, try to catch up to those ahead of you and exert all the remaining energy that you have for the end of the race.

, Lift your knees and drive your legs back to generate hip drive.Pump your arms and use your upper body to help you reach maximum speed. Tighten up your sprinting technique during practice by keeping a straight posture and working on the proper breathing technique.


You will be gassed towards the last leg of the race and your form may deteriorate. Practice drilling your technique so that you maintain it even when you're tired."

Pass the baton with your right hand and receive it with your left hand.,
Use a verbal command when passing the baton.,
Pass the baton at eye level for your teammate.,
Understand your teammates level of fatigue.",How to Run 1600M Track Relay2," Typically in the 4x400m relay, the incoming runner is on the inside lane while the outgoing runner is in the outside lane. Once you receive the baton, switch it to your other hand so that you can pass it off to the next runner when you complete your lap.The incoming runner is on the inside of the track because it's less distance that they have to run.

, Shouting verbal commands like ""up,"" ""stick,"" or ""hand"" is a common tactic implemented by most track and relay teams. Practice drilling the handoff process, so your team is all on the same page for the verbal command. While the 4x400m relay consists of a visual handoff, using verbal commands will improve your timing and make the hand off more fluid.

, Your teammates must be able to see exactly where you are placing the baton. They must have the baton in their hand before they can start running .Lift the baton to eye level so the outgoing runner will be able to grab it easily.


Unlike the 4x100, there are no designated lanes after the second lap in the 1600m relay, so it can get confusing when passing it after the second runner.
In the 4x100 and 4x200 runners usually use a blind exchange, where teammates only use the verbal command for passing the baton.During the pass off it's likely runners will be bumping into each other.

, A bad handoff is better than no handoff at all. If the baton is dropped or the incoming runner is gassed and slow, it's the outgoing runner's responsibility to turn around and ensure that the baton pass is complete.Examine your teammate and determine their fatigue level. If you need to slow down to accommodate them, delay your acceleration period to complete the pass. Look at your teammates faces and see how much they are slowing down when approaching the pass. If they seem distressed or strained, you may have to go slower out of the gate.


You can also pick up on teammate tendencies during practice.
If the baton is dropped, pick it up and resume the race.

Devise a team strategy based on individual strengths and weaknesses.,
Choose your best starter to lead off in the race.,
Choose good baton handlers for the second and third runners.,
Choose a strong anchor.,
Train in long distance running during the offseason.",How to Run 1600M Track Relay3," There are a variety of different strategies that a team can use in the 1600m relay. Examine each team member for their strengths and weaknesses and put them in the leg of the race that would be most beneficial for the overall time. Decide whether you want to run from behind and finish strong, or if you want to get a big lead early and maintain it.


For instance, some teams prefer to put their slowest runners in the third leg of the race, while other teams put their fastest runners in those slots to widen a winning gap., A common misconception is that the fastest runner should start, but this isn't true. There is a combination of skills that go into being a good starter.For one, they must be good out of the gate, and must be good at pushing off the starting block and avoiding false starts. Starting runners also must be mentally strong because they can't judge their placement in the race during the first lap because of designated lanes and the staggered start of the runners.Combine all these skills together and pick the person on the team that is best at all of them.


During practice determine the person that is the most capable of launching off the starting block and reaching their maximum speed in a short period.
A false start occurs when athletes begin to run before the referee initiates the race., Runners in the second and third position must be proficient at handling and receiving the baton, so it's critical that they drill passing it.A bad baton pass could cost your team valuable seconds that could cost you the race, and the second and third runners are the only runners in the race who must exchange it twice.

, The anchor is the last person running in the race and is usually the team's fastest runner. Their goal is to maintain the lead that the second and third runners opened up, or catch up to other teams during the last leg of the race. If you plan on putting weaker runners before the anchor, make sure that the anchor is mature and self-confident enough to catch up to other teams when your team is behind., The 4x400 is one of the most grueling long distance sprinting events and requires a good cardiovascular system. Running long distance during the offseason will help you build up your cardio so that you can run at your highest speed for a longer period when you're doing relays. "
"
Don't eat or drink anything right before the race because it will cause cramps, but be sure to eat well a while before and stay hydrated.,
Run shorter races like the 100 and the 200 to improve your speed for the race.,
Run the 800 and mile help for endurance in the 400, but running any further becomes less helpful because it starts to focus too heavily on aerobic endurance over anaerobic endurance, which is the opposite of what the 400 is about.

,
Lift light weights with high repetitions to help your muscles get used to fatigue and handle it better.

,
Running the race: go out fast the first 100 and then ""float"" the second 100, easing slightly but still going very hard.,
Talk yourself into it.",How to Run 400 Meters,";
, If you run enough of these it will improve your speed and give you an idea of how close to your top speed you are going.

,,, Then really hammer the third 100 near all-out effort, and then push as hard as you can until the finish. The 400 is often won by the person who slows down the least. Do not run flat footed.

, To run a 400 at your best you have to really want and be pumped about it. Get yourself excited about the race.

Pace yourself early in the workout.,
Run the last mile faster than the first miles.,
Keep up with someone in front of you.",How to Push Yourself Through the Last Mile of a Run1," A good strategy to help you make it through that last mile of your run is to pace yourself through your entire run. Many people start off running fast because they are energized and excited, but by the last mile, they feel fatigued and their energy levels have depleted. To make sure you can push yourself through that last mile, try to keep an even pace.To pace yourself, start off slower than what you feel like you can run. You want to make sure that you use roughly the same pace through the entire run to save energy for the last mile.
If you have problems pacing yourself, use a running app on your phone that can help calculate how fast you run each mile. You can also use a watch or stopwatch and give yourself a set time limit for when you want to finish each mile.
For example, if you are running a 5K, you want each of the three miles to be around the same duration. You may be able to run a nine minute mile for the first mile, but that leads to you walking part of the last mile. Instead, try to run each mile between 11 and 12 minutes.;
, If you are struggling to get through that last mile, try rearranging your pace so that you run your last mile faster. This means you have to consciously run slower at the beginning to conserve your energy. Once you hit the last mile, increase your speed and run faster. This helps you push through that last mile and get it over faster than the early miles.For example, if you are running a 10K, you may run the first five miles at a significantly slower pace. Then, once you hit that five mile mark, you increase your pace to finish strong. If your average mile is a nine minute mile, you may run the first five miles at 11 to 12 minutes, then increase to a nine to 10 minute mile in the last mile.
Consider cutting the run in half. Run the first half at a slower pace and then run the last half at a faster pace. You may run the first three miles at a 13 minute mile but then increase your speed to a 10 minute mile for the last three, which can help you push through to the end.

, If you are running a race and you are unsure you are going to finish that last mile, choose someone in front of you running at a reasonable pace and stay with them. Use them as a running buddy and motivation tool.Setting your sights on someone ahead of you can help keep you moving, give you something visual to move towards, and keep you motivated. This can help you push through that last mile.

Repeat positive mantras to yourself.,
Remind yourself of your strength and accomplishments.,
Focus on your reasons for running.,
Sing or hum a favorite song.,
Envision an end-of-run reward.,
Get a running partner.,
Join a running club.",How to Push Yourself When Running1," Pick a certain phrase that motivates you and repeat this in your head before, during, and even after each run. Keep it short and positive in tone. You might say, “I can do this,” or “Keep it going.” Once you establish a breathing pattern, you can say this phrase in between breaths to keep the pattern going., Dig back into your memory and recall the last time you felt like stopping during a run. Then, recall what happened when you kept going. You can also think about general moments in life that you are proud of, such as when you graduated from college., Everyone hits the pavement for a unique set of reasons. Instead of focusing on the negatives, like leg soreness, think about what you get out of running. Maybe hitting the track makes you healthier and more able to play with your children. Perhaps marathons let you express your competitive instincts., Most of us have a particular type of music or a certain artist that gets us pumped up and excited. Create a playlist on your iPod or other device that includes songs to motivate you to pick up the pace. You could also include songs or genres that are inspirational, such as gospel. Keep adjusting your playlist until it fits your needs and refresh it regularly as well.If you are running a longer distance, like a marathon, you may want to test out podcasts or even audio books as well. Just make sure to keep up the pace as you listen.

, Focus on a nice, cool bottle of Gatorade waiting for you after the run. Or, perhaps picture yourself enjoying a soothing bath. The reward itself should be enticing enough to catch and hold your interest. It should also be attainable. Many social runners often envision the gathering awaiting them post-run.Some runners actually build a reward in to their route. For example, they purposefully go by an ice cream shop toward the end of their run to grab a quick cone.

, If you are in a relationship, see if your partner is interested in joining you on runs. Or, ask a friend or acquaintance. Go to a gym and find another runner who is looking for a partner. You don’t have to run at exactly the same pace to benefit from running with one another. In fact, they can even just start off with you and then separate. Or, if they are faster, they may push you to excel., Contact your local gyms or rec centers to see if they have an active running group in place. Or, hit your local running store and ask if they know of any running clubs that are currently active. Participating in a group will keep you accountable and it will also provide an outlet for any questions that you may have.You can also join digital running groups that allow you to enter your run information online and talk with others. These can be a good option if you don’t feel like starting up your own face-to-face club.

Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.,
Try a sports drink instead of water.,
Have a healthy snack or small meal.,
Make sure you have the right footwear.,
Dress warmly in cold weather.,
Wear light clothing in hot weather.,
Start warming up for a run by walking.,
Add strides to your walking.,
Perform some dynamic stretches.",How to Prepare for Running," While there is no specific amount of water that is recommended by fitness experts before a run, you will want to hydrate before and during your run. It is not a good idea to do a long run without having a substantial drink of water beforehand. It is certainly possible to run without hydrating first, but this will make your run more difficult and you risk severe dehydration.
Fitness experts do recommend that you make sure your urine is a light yellow color before heading out for a run. If it is light in color you are well hydrated. Try drinking at least 8 to 16 ounces of water before a run to start. You may need more or less.
You should also drink during your run. Most people will sweat out 24 to 32 ounces of water per hour during exercise. You should aim to replace 75% of this during a run, so it is suggested that you drink between 18 to 24 ounces of water per hour of exercise.;
, This is especially important if your sodium levels tend to be low. Sodium is a very important nutrient for your body. You sweat out sodium when you exercise, so it is important to replace it.
If your skin is very salty after a run, you are losing sodium.
Most people lost 800-1500mg of sweat per hour when they exercise.
Sports drinks like Gatorade contain sodium and electrolytes; 8 ounces of Gatorade has 110mg of sodium and Gatorade Performance contains 200mg. These are great options for sodium replacement.
You can also put a little bit of salt into your drinking water if you don't care for sports drinks.

, Your body doesn't just need water and sodium to fuel itself. It is important that you have a balanced snack with protein and carbohydrates before a run.
Pairing a protein and carbs can help you prevent a sudden drop in blood sugar while running.
Protein intake can help you to burn fat during exercise.
Nutritionists recommend a light meal or snack such as a tortilla with banana, honey and almond butter.
Alternatively, another good pre-run snack is an oatmeal with nuts and dried fruit or yogurt with honey and granola

, A good pair of running shoes can save your feet from strain from running. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society recommends a running shoe for anyone who jogs or runs, as these can prevent painful long-term injuries such as shin splints and tendinitis.
Running shoes are specialized by foot type, gait type, and training styles.
When purchasing athletic shoes, you should try them on after a workout or run when your feet are largest.
The shoe should have a firm grip from your heel to your toe. Well-fitting athletic shoes should be comfortable when you try them on. You shouldn't need to ""break them in"".
When purchasing athletic shoes it is best to go to a specialty store to get a fitting. The sales person can determine which shoe is best for your training level, gait style, and foot type.

, In the cold you will want to make sure any exposed skin is protected. Most runners suggest dressing as if it is 20-30 degrees warmer than it is outside.
For example, if it is 30 degrees outside you can get by comfortably with a thin thermal and a light jacket. As you run, you will generate heat.
Wear thermal leggings or sweat pants for winter running.
In the cold, avoid cotton as it will soak up sweat and leave you cold and damp.
On very cold days, make sure your ears, face, and hands are well covered.
Wear thick socks in cold weather. If it is very damp and cold, you can wrap your feet in plastic bags inside your shoes to keep them dry.

, You will want to avoid wearing non-breatheable fabrics and you should always make sure you have protection from the sun. Wear apparel that is light in color, lightweight, and has vents or mesh.
Fabrics such as microfiber polyesters and cotton blends are recommended.
Also wear a hat and shades in the hot sun.
Apply an SPF 30 or higher sunscreen to avoid skin damage from the sun. You won't want to get sunburn!

, You always want to warm up before running to get your muscles toned and ready for exercise. Walk gently for 3-5 minutes before a run.
This will stretch and move your muscles, tendons and joints and transition your body into a workout.
This activity will enhance blood flow to the muscles you need to use for running.
This initial warm up is very low-intensity and can be essential for runners coming back from an injury.

, Do five or six 100 meter strides. These are also called ""pick-ups"" and will help to increase blood flow to the muscles and help your body transition from walking to running. Jog slowly for at least 2 minutes or more.
Gradually accelerate over the course of 60 to 100 meters, then decelerate.
After each interval, walk around and stretch out your legs for at least 90 seconds.
Keep your steps quick and short as you do the jogging intervals to avoid injury.

, Dynamic stretching uses controlled leg movements to improve range of motion. This will loosen up muscles and help to increase heart rate, body temperature, and blood flow to help you run efficiently.Avoid stretches where you hold a stretch for 30 seconds or more. This can actually contribute to injury if done before a run.
Skipping is an example of a dynamic stretch. Try doing this for 25-50 meters, increasing the height and intensity of your skip as you go.
Backwards jogging is another type of dynamic stretch.
Try doing the side step or shuffle. Step to the side in 10-20 meter intervals from side to side, starting at a walking pace and increasing to a jog.
Do the weave step or grapevine. Step your right foot to the side, then step your left foot behind your right foot. Repeat this for 10-20 meters in one direction, then repeat in the other direction. Start at a walking pace and increase to a jogging pace.

Map the run mentally.,
Focus on making it to what’s in front of you.,
Repeat a mantra to yourself.,
Visualize the finish line.,
Think about what you will do after the run.",How to Push Yourself Through the Last Mile of a Run2," Thinking of the run in smaller steps instead of one long, daunting course can help you pace yourself and mentally prepare yourself for each mile. You can break it into distinct miles, or you may consider thinking about different parts of the course as separate markers.Each time you reach a marker, feel accomplished for making it that far and encourage yourself to make it to the next marker. Breaking it down also helps you tell yourself, “There are only four markers left” or “You’ve made it through two miles; you’ve only got this last one left.”
Separating the course also helps you develop a plan for your run. If you know your first mile is easy, but the second mile drains you so you can’t run the final third mile, you can take the second section and adjust your pace to recover and save yourself enough energy for the third mile. This also is important if you know a course has hills that may take more energy.

, Make finishing the last mile into a game. Choose targets that are in front of you. This may be other runners, trees, end of a block, a turn in the road - anything that you can set as a goal. Play a mental game with yourself to pass that mark. When you pass that mark, set a new target. This helps keep your mind on the physical target and not on how tired you are.For example, if you are in a race, you can choose runners ahead of you as your targets. Slowly gain on them until you have passed them. Then choose another runner to pass. You can see how many runners you have “collected” by the end, and collecting runners can help you ignore the thoughts that you couldn’t finish the race.
If you are running alone, you can play the same kind of game with marks you can see. See how many street corners you can collect, how many curves you can take, or how many trees you can pass.

, Mentally focusing yourself can help you push through that last mile. Repeating a mantra inside your head can keep you focused on those words and not on your fatigue. Also, putting encouraging, motivating words in your head helps you eliminate all negative words.Remove all negative mantras from your head. Don’t think things like, “I can’t do this,” “I think I’m gonna have to quit,” or “I have no energy.”
Instead, adopt positive mantras. Tell yourself, “I can finish this. You can do this. Only one more mile.” You may also repeat key words to yourself, such as, “Relax. Steady. Pace. Calm. Run. Strong.”

, Sometimes, visualizing the end goal can be extremely motivating. If you still have a mile to go, you may feel the end is too far away. However, coming up with a mental picture of the end of that mile can help you keep your focus on your goal and give yourself an image of what you are shooting for instead of nothing.No matter where you are running, come up with a picture of that ending spot. Add a ribbon across it and imagine yourself running through it with fans cheering. It doesn’t matter that no one will be there; give yourself a mental boost that can get you through that last mile.

, Instead of focusing on your body’s fatigue and how you still have one whole mile left, let your mind focus on something else. Think about your day, what you will do when you get home, what you need to do this week, or what plans you want to make for the weekend. Take the focus off your task of running and zone out so you can make it through.For example, you may think about your post-workout snack or spending time with your partner and kids that evening. You may think about a project for work, or the vacation you are taking in a few months. Whatever you can focus your mind on, think about it.

Blast your favorite energetic music.,
Find a running buddy.,
Develop a purpose for running.,
Change your route.,
Keep your body moving efficiently.",How to Push Yourself Through the Last Mile of a Run3," Music is a great motivator when working out. If you are finishing that race and think you may not be able to complete that last mile, put on some energizing music. Pick things with a quick beat, or a song that makes you feel invincible.Two to three motivating songs can get you through your last mile.
Design your playlist where your most invigorating songs are placed at the end of the running playlist.

, If you can’t quite get through that last mile alone, try finding a running buddy. Working out with another person can help motivate you and keep you moving when you think you can’t move anymore. Being with another person can give you someone to hold you accountable for your runs, helping you push through that last mile.Ask your partner, best friend, kids, parents, or co-worker to run with you.

, Ask yourself why you are running. Are you training for a race? Trying to improve your health? Attempting to lose a few pounds? Come up with a concrete purpose for running. Keeping this purpose in mind can help you push yourself through difficult times and reach your goal of that last mile.For example, you might tell yourself, “Getting through this last mile is one step closer to fitting into my clothes” or “This last mile is helping me lower my cholesterol and high blood pressure.”

, If you are struggling with that last mile, consider changing your route. If you are running the same course and never getting through the final mile, you may need to change it up. Perhaps the course has too many hills, or there are hills at the end keeping your from finishing. Try a different course, or run the course the opposite way, to see if you can make it through that last mile.Adjusting your route may make it easier or less intense so you can push through that last mile. Once you have successfully conquered the mile, you can go back to the original course and push through that last mile on the course you had trouble with.

, Making sure your form is good and that your body is moving in the best way can help you make it through that last mile. Poor form may exhaust your muscles or drain unnecessary energy. Do a check on your form throughout the entire workout to keep yourself moving efficiently and not wasting energy.You should be running with short and quick strides. This is especially important at the end of the workout, when you may start to get sloppy because you are tired. You may start elongating your running gait, which can cause fatigue and injury.

Keep a log of your runs.,
Set reasonable goals.,
Break down your run into chunks.,
Save energy for the end of your run.,
Experiment with a different time of day.,
Run somewhere new.",How to Push Yourself When Running2," Get a small journal or notebook and write down your distances, dates, and times. Look over it to see how you are progressing. You can also purchase apps for your phone that will help you to track your runs. Consult your phone when running to monitor your pace.

, Think about your most recent runs and try to increase the distance or speed up your pace on future runs. It may help to write down your goals for each day’s run. Choose goals that you can actually attain or you may get burned out., When you feel like quitting toward the middle or end of a race, split the remaining distance into pieces. This will allow you to reach a series of small goals on the way to one major one. Each time that you complete a chunk, praise yourself and further divide the remaining pieces. Keep doing this until you reach the finish line.For example, if you have 8 miles left to go, try breaking it into 2 mile chunks. Watch for each 2 mile section to pass and then celebrate mentally before moving onward.

, Make a note of where/when you lag at each race. Then, in future races, start to purposefully slow your pace in the minutes before you hit this wall. You may also need to regulate your pace at the very start of the run, especially if you start at almost a sprint.For some runners, training with an interval workout is helpful is teaching them how to ramp up and ramp down their speeds and energies.

, You might fall into a rut if you follow the same running schedule every day. This may make you more complacent and lead to less of an effort on your part. So, every few weeks, switch up your routine and add a few opposite-time runs in. If you usually run in the morning, take a quick evening jog and vice versa.People who run in the mornings generally see a larger boost in energy and better sleep than evening athletes. If you switch up your routine temporarily, you may find that another time suits you even better.

, Running on the same path can be helpful in that you know the landmarks for pacing; however, it can also get boring really fast. Try to add short new legs to your run. Hop in the car and go to a park for a change of pace. Make sure that you are running on different types of terrain to add in even more of a challenge. All of this will help you to keep pushing yourself to new levels."

Find a focal point outside of yourself.,
Disconnect pain from injury.,
Be careful when injured.,
Respond quickly to serious physical warning signs.,
Consult with a doctor.",How to Push Yourself When Running3," To do your best, you’ll want to concentrate on the moment. But, you can also find small ways to take mental breaks as well. While you are running, pay attention to the environment around you. Try to focus on the spectators on the sidelines of your marathon. Or, perhaps keep your focus on the trees or greenery. This will take your mind off your discomfort., If you are not in pain due to an acute injury, then you can generally compartmentalize the negative sensations connected with pain, thus minimizing its power over you. Don’t give pain more power than it should have. If you experience discomfort, start to think about all of the ways that pain can be good.For example, muscles are often sore or in pain before they regenerate even stronger.
Just be aware of your body and know how to differentiate “true” pain, such as shin splits, from “false” pain, such as muscle soreness.

, If you know that you are suffering from an injury, such as shin splits, then it is a good idea to modify your training regimen. You may need to run for shorter periods of time or distances. Try to develop a plan to build back up to your desired goals, but realize that you will need to be realistic about what your body can, and can’t, do when injured.

, There are some moments when pain and discomfort must be taken seriously. If you feel a sharp pain in your shin or hips, it is best to slow or stop running. If you start to experience tightness in your chest or severe stomach pains, stop and seek out help as well. When in doubt, trust your instincts and err on the side of caution., If you suspect that you are injured or if you are experiencing noticeable pain when running, it may be a good idea to talk with your physician. Explain your running routine and ask them for advice regarding potential modifications. View your visit as an opportunity to learn more about your body in order to maximize its potential.

Get the right shoes.,
Invest in comfortable clothes.,
Carry a water bottle.,
Write down the date of your race.,
Develop a training schedule.,
Hold yourself accountable.,
Mix up your exercise routine by cross training.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats.",How to Prepare for a Race," The correct shoe will support your ankle, lock your heel into place, and give your toes enough room to wiggle around.Long-distance running shoes – anything over a 5k – are heavier because of added comfort. If you’re training for a shorter race, look for lighter-weight racing shoes to increase speed.Each foot is made up differently. Experts can help you determine your unique foot characteristics to find shoes that support weaker areas. Your shoe should not just be on your foot, but part of it.
Feet grow and change in small but significant ways with age, so don’t presume that a 3-year-old pair will fit even if they’re still in good shape.;
, Activewear fabrics like Dri-FIT are designed to move sweat away from the body, whereas traditional cotton absorbs it.By using lightweight, sweat-resistant clothing, your endurance will grow as you stay comfortable. You don’t need an entirely new wardrobe, either; just get a couple of the right products to cycle through.

, If you plan to train with the water bottle in hand, opt for something smaller and with a nozzle for easier drinking on the go.If you can, plan a route that has water stations so you can refill it if you need to. Additionally, water-pack systems like those from CamelBak keep plenty of water in your reach without becoming tedious to maneuver.


Plastic bottles can contain harmful chemicals, so when in doubt, opt for a stainless steel one., Studies have found a link between writing down goals and following through with them.Write down your race on something you will see each day, like a calendar or a sticky note on your desk. You want to prevent this goal from becoming an abstract concept for you.

, The most successful training schedules incorporate consistency and variety harmoniously. The purpose of creating a schedule is to give yourself time to master a distance and then challenge yourself to raise it slowly until you’ve hit your distance goal.Use the 10% rule when creating your schedule, which says that you should not increase your mileage by more than 10% from week to week.If you’re new to running long distances, give yourself extra time to train so you don’t hurt yourself. If the average 5k training program is 3 weeks, give yourself 5 or 6 weeks. If the average marathon training program is 16 weeks, give yourself 18., Finding someone to train with can be a huge step in manifesting your goal. If you want to train alone but still need motivation, find a friend to check in with on a weekly basis. The point is that you want to create an outside source to bolster your motivation.


Fitness apps like Zombies, Run! and Fitocracy use a reward-based system for the work you do so you can see something tangible for being diligent.
Remember why you made this goal in the first place. A big motivator will be finding the joy in your training.

, Rest your running muscles from time to time by doing exercise that focuses on different muscle groups. Swimming, yoga, and pilates can keep your muscles warm while preventing possible burnout from focusing on a single activity.


Stretching-based workouts like yoga are especially good to repair and soothe sore muscles., Without proper hydration, your training schedule can quickly fall off-track. Your recovery time will take longer, your muscles will burn deeper, and your drive and dedication will most likely falter. It sounds silly, but a good rule of thumb when it comes to hydrating is to drink when you’re thirsty and not necessarily when you’ve hit a certain number of ounces or cups each day.When running long distances during training, you should drink water at least every 20-30 minutes, or more if you need. The goal, however, is to drink water consistently enough that you rarely feel thirsty., Limit the number of processed foods you eat, like protein bars and shakes. Instead, focus mostly on foods that don’t have a nutrition label – things like fruits, vegetables, and fish.Your diet should consist primarily of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats.


Good sources of carbohydrates include quinoa, brown rice, and whole-grain pasta.
For protein, chicken and fish are the easiest for your body convert into energy.
Healthy fats consist of all kinds of nut varieties (pistachios, peanuts, almonds) as well as avocados and olive, canola, and coconut oils.Eat a snack high in carbs and protein within an hour after finishing a run to replenish energy quickly.

Maybe there is a themed race in your city or a race a few hours away in a different town. Look online for themed races that are coming up and still open for registration. You may also go for themed races that are popular on a national level and decide to travel to participate in the race.For example, the Color Run is a 5k themed race that has spread to 50 states. You may search for a Color Run happening in your town or city and sign up for it.;
, You can also select the themed race based on the cause it is raising money for. If you are passionate about a particular cause, you may go for a themed race that will raise funds to support the cause. Many themed races will donate a portion of the proceeds from the run to a charity or nonprofit organization.For example, you may pick a themed run that supports breast cancer research or research on ALS. Or you may pick a themed run that raises money for local homeless shelters or for afterschool care programs in your area.

, Look for a themed race that has a fun theme or idea that you want to experience. Maybe you have always wanted to get splattered with colored powder while you run or you want to try to eat donuts or hot dogs while you are running. Go for a themed race that will be entertaining and allow you to try something you’ve never done before.You may look for a themed race that supports a cause you believe in and that has a fun or exciting theme that you are into. Having both elements could make running the themed race feel worthwhile.
Try picking a themed race that feels festive and appropriate for the time of year, such as a holiday themed race. This could be the Santa Claus themed run or a Thanksgiving themed run.

, Some themed races will be longer or more strenuous than others. If you are new to running, go for a themed race that is short and easy. Races that are 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) and under are often ideal for beginner runners. If you are a more experienced runner, try a more challenging themed race, such as a 10 kilometer (6.2 mi) or 20 kilometer run.Most themed races will note if they are meant for beginner racers or new runners. Often, themed races are tailored to runners who are less experienced.

, To get into the spirit of the themed race, pick a costume. Wearing a costume that fits the theme of the race will make the experience more fun and help to promote the race online and on social media. Go shopping for a costume or make your own at home. Making your own costume can be a fun way to get creative and have fun with the theme of the race.For example, if you are participating a themed superhero race, you may dress up as your favorite superhero or make up your own superhero costume.

Call ahead of time to reserve a spot for the race. If you are competing as a team, make sure you register your team for the race before the cut off date so you can all participate.Depending on how large the themed race is, the deadline for registering may be strict or a bit more lax. A local themed race with a small number of participants may allow you to drop in and participate rather than sign up. A bigger themed race with hundred or thousands of participants will likely require you to sign up in advance.

, If you are running a themed race to raise money for a worthy cause, do your fundraising before race day. The themed race organizers should give you a fundraising packet or an online donation page that you can use to help raise money for the race. You may have a target amount of money you would like to hit or leave it open and encourage loved ones to donate as much as they can.For example, you may have a target amount of $500 that you would like to raise for the themed race.

Not only will this make running even more of a challenge, it will also make you look tense and uncomfortable. If you want to look good, focus on keeping your shoulders down and relaxed.


It is easy to do this without realizing it, so try to remind yourself every now and then to see if your shoulders are starting to creep up. You can do this by lifting your shoulders up to your ears. Then, on an exhale, let your shoulders relax as much as you can. You don't need to do this every 5 minutes, but try to be conscious of your shoulders.;
, If you are not in very good shape, or if you are getting tired, you are likely to let your feet drag lazily. However, if you want to look like good while running, you should focus on picking up your feet. You don’t have to lift them high into the air. Instead, just focus on keeping your feet energetic.


Doing this will help make it look as though you have lots of energy during your run, and will make you look like you are really enjoying your run.

, When running, many people have a tendency to scrunch up their face into a grimace. Running can be very challenging, so this facial expression is understandable. However, if you want to look good, try to keep your face relaxed, and your expression friendly.


It will help if you keep your breathing as consistent and steady as possible. Take deep breaths in, and then try to breathe out in a controlled way.

, It may be tempting to take very long strides to look as though you are running faster. However, if you want to look good while you are running, you should keep your stride a bit shorter. You don’t want take baby steps, but don’t try to stride out as though you are a gazelle. Not only will you look silly, you will also be wasting energy trying to do this.


It is recommended that you have around 180 foots strikes each minute. This means that your feet touch the ground about 180 times in 60 seconds. You can see if you are getting around this number by counting the number of times each foot hits the ground for 15 seconds, and then multiplying that number by four., Heel striking is a common mistake that runners make. This occurs when you let the heel of your foot hit the ground first, rather than the ball of your foot. If you want to look good running, try focusing on getting the ball of your foot to be the place where your foot first contacts the ground.Not only is this good for your running technique, it will make you look better while you are running.


By doing this, you will appear relaxed and more energetic.

, Many people tend to let their arms flail around when they are running, especially if they are tired. When you are running, keep your arms bent at 90 degrees, and let them pump back and forth naturally. Try to keep them going only backwards and forwards, rather than letting them drift outwards like chicken wings. Not only does this waste energy, but it also looks a bit silly.Conserving energy will also help keep you looking fresh during your run.

, The majority of running clothes come in very bright colors in order to make you more visible on the road. While these colors may be pretty, they might not always be the most flattering for your skin tone.


For safety reasons, its a good idea to have at least one article of clothing that stands out, either because it is very brightly and boldly colored, or just because it is a lighter color, such as white or lavender.

, Running in an old pair of worn out shoes can be painful, and those old shoes probably don’t look that great anymore. If you want to look good (and be comfortable) while running, you should invest in a good pair of running shoes. It is probably a good idea to choose the shoes in a more neutral color so that they won’t clash with your different running outfits.


You could also try to purchase all of your running clothing in the same colors. This way, you can also purchase the shoes to match your outfits.
Don’t forget socks! Many running stores sell socks specifically made for running. These socks help keep your feet cool and comfortable. If you want to look good while running, opt for ankle socks that won’t show too much above the top of your shoe.

, Running in a pair of worn out shorts or a pair of baggy sweatpants will not help you look good. Therefore, you should look for running pants or shorts that are tight and stretchy. Not only will they help keep you cooler by wicking away sweat, they will also make you look good.


If you are self-conscious about your legs, and know you won’t feel comfortable wearing skin-tight clothing, then look for running pants that are a bit looser. However, don’t just skip straight to the baggy sweats. They may be comfortable, but they aren’t flattering on anyone, regardless of one’s body size.
Running tights come in a multitude of colors and patterns. Although you should buy whatever makes you happy, it may be easiest to purchase all of your running tights in a more neutral color such as black or grey. This way, you can choose just about any color top you want, and it will always match well with your pants.
If you choose grey pants, be aware that this color may show sweat more readily than other colors such as black. If you are worried about sweat stains, stick with black, which will hide sweat.

, Rather than choosing an old t-shirt, opt for a fitted running t-shirt or a tank top. Many of the big sports brands make very stylish tops that also wick sweat away from your skin helping you keep cool, and thus, looking good.


If you are self-conscious about your size, you can also look for looser running tops, as these are becoming more popular these days. These shirts will not cling to your skin, and will be more flowy.
Make sure to choose tops in colors that flatter your skin tone.

, Regardless of your bra size, you should wear a sports bra. Not only will this keep you more comfortable, it will also be more flattering.


If you have never been fitted for a sports bra specifically, it may be good to visit a sports store, where they can help show you different fittings, and types of sports bras. This is especially important if you are a woman with large breasts, as running can be very uncomfortable, and even dangerous, without the right bra.

, Many companies make underwear specifically for sports. These underwear can help keep sweat contained, and help you avoid wedgies, which don’t look good. Some shorts and running pants also come with built in underwear, which means you don’t need to wear underwear at all.

, A good pair of sport sunglasses can be a life-saver on a bright day. It will also keep you from squinting into the sun, which will give your face a scrunched look. Many companies make sunglasses designed to stay in place during sports. These glasses come in various shapes and sizes, so there is bound to be something that will suit your face well.


Avoid wearing regular sunglasses when running. More often than not, these sunglasses will simply bounce around while you are running, or they will slide down your nose. Not only will this be annoying for you, but it probably won’t look good either.

, When you get dressed to go out for your run, take a second to look in the mirror. Do you like what you see? Will the outfit you’re wearing help you feel more confident during your run?


It’s important to take a quick look in the mirror. Sometimes we think an outfit looks great when we lay it all out, but somehow it doesn’t flow as well once we put it on.

, When you go outside, you should always wear sunscreen to protect your skin. Remember that the sun’s rays can still harm your skin, even on an overcast day.


Make sure to apply it to your face, the tops of your ears, and any skin that will be exposed while you are outside.
You can look for a body moisturizer that includes an SPF in it. This way, you will be moisturizing and protecting at the same time.
If you want to add a bit of glow to your sunscreen, mix a bit of shimmery powder into your sunscreen before applying it to your skin.
Don’t forget your hair! While it may not be ideal to put sun cream directly on your hair, there are hair products on the market that contain an SPF to protect your hair as well.

, Unless you have very short hair, you will want to do something with your hair to keep it out of your face. If you have bangs, it is best to pin them up so that they won't end up a sticky, sweaty mess. You can do this by, for example, folding them back to create a little poof, and then using two bobby pins to hold the poof in place.


If you have very long, straight hair you can brush your hair into a sleek ponytail. This will help keep you cool, and make you look fresh. You could also consider braiding the ponytail to keep it more contained.
If you have curly hair, pull your hair up into a messy bun, and use bobby pins to pin any unruly curls into the ponytail.
Sport headbands can also work great for helping keep your hair sleek, and out of your face.

, Keep it simple though. The idea with looking good while running is to make it look effortless, as though you just naturally look good. If you have a full face of makeup on, then it will look like you are trying very hard. Avoid wearing a bright lipstick. Instead, opt for a lightly tinted balm if you want to add some color to your lips.


Look for lip balms that have an SPF to help keep your lips protected.
You can also put on a waterproof mascara.
If you want to apply eyeliner, look for one that is waterproof, and stick to lighter more natural looking colors. You should also stick to a thin, natural line around your lashes. You don’t need to do a winged eyeliner when going out for a run.
If you feel that you need a bit of coverage on your skin, look for a tinted moisturizer. This will help keep your skin looking natural while also providing a bit of coverage to help with any blemishes.
Avoid wearing foundation. When you are running, you are going to sweat. If you choose a full coverage foundation, chances are you will sweat it off, and there will be streaks all over your face.

Sprint up hills.,
Do wall drills to improve knee drive.,
Push a weighted sled as fast as possible.,
Lift large weights quickly.,
Run stadium stairs.,
Combine exercises with sprints.",How to Increase Acceleration1," Running up hills is far more challenging than running on a flat surface because you're fighting gravity. Doing hill sprints builds strength in your legs and will help you increase your acceleration as well as making you faster.Sprint as quickly as you can, then walk back down the hill slowly, using the walk down as your rest time. Do this drill as many times as you can and still get complete rest on the walk down. The longer and steeper the hill is, the more challenging this drill is.;
, Wall drills force you to drive your knees high, which over time will not only increase your acceleration but also improve your overall speed. These drills are easy to do and require no equipment (apart from a wall).Get in position for a wall drill by placing your hands against the wall so your arms are straight and parallel to the floor. Your body should be a straight line from your head to your ankles, angled at about 45 degrees.
Raise your right knee to hip level, flexing your foot, then lower and repeat the motion with your left knee. Alternate this movement as quickly as you can for 10 seconds, keeping your core active and your lower back tight.
Do from one to three sets of this exercise.

, Sled pushes develop strength in your legs, giving you more power that will help increase your acceleration. You should load the sled with approximately 10 percent of your bodyweight.Place your hands on the sled so that your body is at a 45-degree angle and start sprinting, pushing the sled as fast as you can for 10 to 20 yards to equal a set. Do anywhere from three to six sets of this exercise.

, Building strength in your muscles will enable you to increase your acceleration and sprint speed, particularly if you lift them as quickly as possible. When lifting weights to increase your acceleration, choose the largest weight you can lift with proper form.Time your lifts, and focus on doing as many reps as you possibly can while maintaining proper form. Lifting quickly will help build fast-twitch muscle fiber, which will make you faster off the mark.

, Take advantage of your local high school stadium and run the stairs to build strength and help increase your acceleration. Run the stairs as quickly as possible, aiming to hit every other step instead of every step.Running every other step puts your body at the 45-degree angle that is crucial for maximum acceleration.

, If you already do exercises such as push-ups or mountain climbers, you can use them as an introduction to a short sprint. Getting in and out of these positions improves your functional mobility.With better functional mobility, you'll increase your strength as well as your acceleration.
These exercises are particularly helpful if you play a sport such as soccer or tennis where you need speed as well as good reaction time.

Get the right gear.",How to Improve Your Sprinting," If you have a particular race for which you wish to prepare, give yourself plenty of time to reach your goals. It may help to define what exactly those goals are. For instance, are you trying to improve your time by 10%, or are you more focused on perfecting your form?


By writing realistic and attainable goals on a calendar, you are more likely to stay on track with your training plan.
Make sure that your training plan can be accommodated by your existing schedule. You are more likely to continue making progress toward your goals when training doesn’t become a chore, but is something that you enjoy.;
, This can be a huge confidence builder, and a fun way to improve your sprinting. Training with a group or a partner helps you stay motivated when the going gets tough, and pushes you harder than you might push yourself alone.Being accountable to a group rather than just to yourself also makes it much more likely that you will achieve your goals.

, Sprinting requires quite a bit of power, so you’ll need to spend some time working on your strength and muscle. Spending time in the gym will help to break up your training schedule, and is a good alternative to running during inclement weather.


Try doing some bench presses (3 sets of 6 reps), barbell squats (3 sets of 6 reps), and some chin-ups (10 reps).Yoga is another great option for building strength and improving balance.

, Start with a quick jog around the track to get your legs and body warmed up. This will loosen up your muscles to prevent pulling them.


Stretch out your legs and hips. Standing with your hands on your hips, try swinging each leg back and forth 25 times.After 10 minutes of stretching, you should be warmed up enough to start working out.

, If you are a beginning sprinter, start at about 50% of your full speed until you feel comfortable, and you can gradually increase your speed from there. Run about 6-10 100-meter dashes, making sure to walk back slowly to the starting line in order to give your body a rest between .sprintsIf you are still fatigued, wait for 2 minutes before beginning the next dash.

, After a grueling training session, make sure to let your body cool itself down by walking around the track for a few minutes. Stopping suddenly can cause your legs to cramp.

, Many runners like to lean forward, as this causes a temporary increase in speed, but you should try to remain upright while sprinting. Good posture will help you run more consistently, run faster, and will help to prevent injuries!Keep your spine straight, and your head up and looking forward.
It may help to imagine a string attached to the top of your head being pulled upward., Make sure that your feet are landing directly underneath your hips, in order to avoid creating too much impact shock to your legs, which can cause injury. Sprinting with a more natural step will help you also to have a more efficient stride.With each stride, lift your front knee, and straighten your back leg. Keep your strides short and quick at first, and gradually lengthen your strides as you get closer to the finish line., Cadence is the average number of steps you take with both feet in a minute. You can determine what your cadence is by counting the number of times either your left or right foot strikes the ground in a minute and multiply that number by two.


Top runners generally have a cadence over 180 steps per minute.
Try increasing your cadence by using a metronome to train your body to recognize a rhythm that beats at a particular tempo. Keep in mind that it can take 6-8 weeks to improve your cadence., Making sure to keep your shoulders and arms relaxed rather than hunched up, allow your arms to move at the same rhythm as your legs, keeping them moving in a straight line rather than from side to side. Try keeping your hands open, and bringing them backward as you sprint.


Get your arms in the proper position by pretending that you are lightly holding a small bird in each hand.Proper arm motion will help you move your legs more quickly as well.

, Try putting your quick foot (the one you use to catch yourself when someone pushes you forward) in the rear. Right before you start sprinting, take a couple of deep breaths to super-oxygenate your lungs.

, You are what you eat, as the adage goes. In order to give your body proper fuel for running, make sure to eat healthy and nourishing meals in the week prior to your race. As a runner, you will be burning plenty of calories, so it is important that you replenish your system with nutritious foods. Sprinters in particular should focus on eating proteins and healthy fats for short bursts of energy, rather than carbohydrates which are better suited for long-distance running.Try taking in around 1 gram of protein such as chicken, fish, or lean ground beef per pound of body weight per day.
Eat plenty of dark fruits and vegetables such as kale, blueberries, and raspberries. They should make up about 30% of your diet.
Satisfy your snacking cravings with healthy fats such as natural peanut butter, almond butter, and avocados.
Avoid sweets and heavy meals.

, Drink plenty of water on the days leading up to your race. On race day itself, make sure to drink 8-16 ounces of water 1-2 hours before your run, but avoid taking in too many fluids in the last 45 minutes prior to running unless it is an unusually hot day. Drinking too much water right before sprinting may cause you to have cramps and an uncomfortably full bladder.Avoid drinking coffee or alcohol in the days leading up to the race, as too much of either can dehydrate your body.
To make sure you are hydrating properly after a run, consider weighing yourself before and after the run to see how much fluid you are losing while sprinting. For each pound lost while running, you should drink as many as 24 ounces of water or a sports drink to replenish your fluids., All the training in the world won’t do you much good if you don’t have the right shoes. In the sprinting world, a fraction of a second could be all that stands between you and the gold, so make sure your feet have all the help they can get.


Sprinting shoes, known as track spikes, are built for speed and have built-in spikes that grip the track as you tear toward the finish line. They should be lightweight and fit snugly.

Determine your foot strike.,
Find the foot strike that works for you.,
Shorten your stride.,
Buy the proper shoes.,
Determine if you need to change your stride.,
Work on changing your strike and stride over a period of time.",How to Improve Your Running Gait1," The way your foot falls onto the ground is one of the most important things about your gait. The foot strike impacts the way you absorb shock and how fast you run. It also helps you choose running shoes. The way your foot falls on the ground also leads to certain runner’s injuries. The different types of foot strikes include:Heel strike. This occurs when you put the ground with your heel first. After your heel hits the ground, you follow through with the middle of your foot, then the front, then the toes.
Midfoot strike. This occurs when you land around the ball of your foot. Usually the heel hits next, then follows through to the toe.
Forefoot strike. This occurs when you land on the front of your foot, around your toes. If you have this foot strike, your heel rarely touches the ground. This is common for people who sprint.;
, Studies and experts disagree about which foot strike is the best. Some say that a heel strike should be avoided because it causes more impact and injury and leads to overstriding. Others think forefoot strikes should be avoided unless you sprint while some think forefoot strikes are the best. Despite this conflicting information, many professional and recreational runners believe that foot strike isn't as important as stride length.Generally, heel strike running is slower than forefoot running.
Forefoot running generally leads to less impact and strain. However, forefoot running may cause problems if you don't have proper hip extension. This might lead to overstriding.
Heel strikes are associated with more impact, strain, and overstriding. However, if you shorten your stride and still heel strike, you may be using your best gait. The key is to not overstride and keep your feet close to your body as you run.

, No matter what kind of foot strike you use when you run, making sure you land with your feet closer to your body will improve your stride. Shortening your stride so it’s closer to the body helps reduce the risk of stress on your muscles and bones, along with helping make you a more efficient runner. Many experts believe that a shorter stride length is the key to a successful gait, not foot strike.Most shorter strides result from midfoot or forefoot strides.
Focus on shortening your stride as you run. Think about where your feet land. If they are landing too far out in front of your, whether you strike on your toe, midfoot, or heel, you need to shorten the stride.
Overstriding leads to decreased performance, along with higher risk of injury.
Some people think a midfoot strike is best for a shorter stride, while others think a forefoot strike is better, but people with a heel strike can also have a shorter, more efficient stride. Since some experts claim a midfoot strike is better, you may want to try changing to a midfoot strike. However, the most important thing to consider when you run is keeping your legs closer to your body, as close to underneath your hips and shoulders as you can, as you stride forward.

, Getting the right stride and foot fall may depend on the shoes you wear. Try wearing lighter shoes that have a flatter angle from heel to toe. This doesn't mean to buy minimalist shoes. The flatter shoe bottom can help improve your gait.You should also buy shoes that fit properly. Your feet expand when you run, so buying shoes that accommodate that is important. You should also buy shoes that keep your foot in place. Many specialty running stores and some sports stores provide help fitting you with the proper shoes.You can also go to a running store to have your gait analyzed. This can help you determine what strike you have, if you are overstriding, and what kinds of shoes may be helpful for you.

, Think about the reasons you want to change your stride. Did someone tell you that you are running wrong? Do you want to improve your speed? Are you getting injured? Figuring out why you want to improve your gait can help determine if you really should work on it.The main reason you should change your gait, stride, or foot fall is if you are getting injured repeatedly.
Most running experts suggest working on cadence to improve running. Stride length can also influence speed.If you are running, improving, and not getting injured, there may be no reason to change your gait.

, You can’t change your foot strike or your stride length overnight. You have to retrain your body to work with the new muscle movements. Your body is used to the stride and strike you use now, so prepare to spend two to three months working on changing your stride.If you are shortening your stride, your muscles are going to have to adjust. They will tighten and shorten as you run differently. Let your body slowly and naturally adapt to the new muscle movement and needed length.
Changing your foot strike and stride will take some mental awareness. This can be difficult, especially if you let your mind relax or focus on your music as you run. You will have to think about each step you land, such as making sure you use a midfoot strike instead of a heel strike.
Spend one to two minutes at a time focusing just on your form. Try it after each ten minutes you run or after each mile.

Start with box jumps.,
Increase power with broad jumps.,
Use hurdles and standing jumps.,
Bound quickly to build force.,
Include single-leg variations.",How to Increase Acceleration2," Plyometric exercises such as box jumps are a good way to build your fast-twitch muscle fibers and increase your explosive power, giving you more speed. Box jumps are one of the simplest vertical-oriented plyometric exercises, and a good way to incorporate plyometrics into your exercise regimen.If you have access to a gym, you'll probably find plyometric boxes there. At least at first, it's advisable to do plyometric exercises with an experienced trainer. Doing them with incorrect form can place too much stress on the joints and lead to injury.
To do box jumps, choose a height that you can jump onto from a standing position on the ground and land in the same position that you started.
Use exaggerated arm swings back and forth. As you swing your arms forward, propel your body up and onto the box. Step back to starting position rather than jumping back down. Do three sets of five repetitions of this exercise.

, When you do broad jumps, you are mimicking the same movement you would make when you accelerate from a standing position. Broad jumps train you to drive your legs into the ground for explosive power to generate speed.Start from a relaxed position with your knees slightly bent. Swing your arms backward in a broad, exaggerated movement, then immediately swing them forward. As your arms swing forward, explode up, driving your legs into the ground.
Propel your body forward as far as you can. When you land, bend your knees slightly to absorb the shock and return to your starting position. Do 5 to 10 broad jumps in a set, completing one to three sets of this exercise.

, The explosive force used in jumping builds fast-twitch muscle fiber to give you power that will improve your speed and acceleration. Use big, exaggerated movements to jump as high and as long as you can.Repeat the jumps as powerfully as possible, focusing on power and good technique over speed.

, Bounding is one of the most common plyometric exercises to help you build powerful force and increase both your speed and acceleration. Since it's an exaggerated running motion, it also builds your sprinting muscles.Jump from one leg to the other, fully extending your back leg as you raise the knee of your front leg to hip level or higher. Aim to move as far forward as possible.
Do three repetitions of this exercise, bounding about 20 meters with each repetition.

, Single-leg training with plyometric exercises can build strength more quickly than doing the exercises with both legs. Single-leg variations also help build your core and improve your overall balance and agility.When doing single-leg variations, make sure you're alternating legs so that you're developing each leg equally. An imbalance where one leg is stronger than the other can lead to joint strain and injury.

Use arm swing drills to increase stride efficiency.,
Work on your shin angle with the ground.,
Create maximum force on your drive out.,
Do kick drills to improve your heel recovery.,
Stretch to improve flexibility in your ankles, knees, and hips.,
Start sprint drills in different positions.,
Enable full recovery after speed workouts.",How to Increase Acceleration3," Moving your arms correctly as you run can help control your stride frequency and increase the length of your stride, enabling you to accelerate more quickly.When you do arm swing drills, keep your arms bent at 90-degree angles at all times, just as you would while sprinting.
Kneel or stand with your arms in running position – one near hip level, the other at shoulder level.
Drive your arms straight forward and back as quickly as possible. Time this drill for between 10 and 30 seconds for each set. Do one to three sets of this exercise.

, To achieve maximum acceleration, you should learn to start low with your shins at about a 45-degree angle from the ground. Starting sprints from push-up position or pushing a sled can help with this.You can do sled pushes more slowly to improve this technique. Slower movement enables your body to feel the correct angle so you gain body memory of proper sprint mechanics for maximum acceleration.

, To increase your acceleration, you should think of pushing into the ground as hard as you can. Acceleration and speed are about force and power, not how fast you move your legs.Strength training is important to maximize your force, as well as plyometric training to help build short-twitch muscle fiber in particular.
Work on striking the ground as hard as you can with your feet and propelling your body forward explosively.

, For maximum acceleration, you need as little movement as possible behind your center of mass. Rather, you should propel your body forward and quickly recover your heels.Think in terms of minimizing backside mechanics and maximizing frontside mechanics. High knee drills have a lot of frontside mechanics, while butt kick drills have a lot of backside mechanics.
Pretending that you're running over hot coals is another drill that can teach you to minimize backside mechanics and improve your heel recovery so you accelerate faster.

, To increase your acceleration, you need full extension in the joints of your lower body. The more flexible your ankles, knees, and hips are, the more efficient your stride will be.You can work stretching into your workout in the form of a dynamic stretching routine for a warm-up, or use stretching to cool down after your core workout.
If you're doing a dynamic stretching routine as part of your warm-up, make sure you spend three to five minutes jogging or doing another activity first to warm up your muscles. You should never stretch cold muscles.
Basic yoga poses designed to open up hip flexors also can be helpful to expand the flexibility in your joints so you can increase your acceleration.

, You can improve your running technique and increase acceleration by varying the position from which you start a short sprint. Work from the ground up, gradually building to vertical starting positions.Keep each sprint between 10 and 30 meters. Start by laying on your back, then work your way up to push-up positions (both up and down).
When you transition to starting from one knee, make sure you push off from each knee, not just one. This will keep your development even in both legs.

, Any sprinting or acceleration training not only taxes your muscles, it also fatigues your central nervous system. Without full recovery, any speed workouts will diminish their effectiveness and may even cause you to lose acceleration.Typically it takes between 36 and 48 hours for full recovery after a speed workout. For this reason you may not want to do acceleration training more than once or twice a week.

Begin your workout.,
Run at a moderate pace for fifteen minutes.,
Begin the interval training.,
Repeat this process four times.,
Cool down.,
Push yourself.,
Measure your improvement.",How to Improve Your Running Speed and Endurance1," Warm up by walking or slowly jogging for five minutes. This should wake up your muscles and help stretch out your legs to prepare for the interval training. Interval training teaches your body to use oxygen more efficiently, improving both your running speed and your overall endurance., Run at a pace that isn’t too difficult but keeps your heartrate up. Aim for 70-80% of your fastest running speed.


Don’t push yourself too hard. This part of the workout isn’t supposed to wear you out. Instead, you’re trying to get your heart rate up so your body starts absorbing oxygen more efficiently.

, This is the part of the exercise that improves your endurance and builds muscle. Run for one minute at your maximum speed, working hard to bring up your heart rate and exhaust your muscles. Then walk for two minutes, letting your muscles cool down.Push yourself as hard as you can during the one minute of running. Interval training doesn’t work properly if you don’t totally exhaust your muscles. This is called “going into the anaerobic zone,” or exercising the point where you’re literally gasping for breath.Try to time yourself so that you run for exactly a minute and rest for exactly two minutes. It can be helpful to use a timer app on your phone or to purchase a stopwatch.

, This should come out to about twelve minutes of exercise. It doesn’t seem like a long time, but by the end of the twelve minutes, you should be utterly exhausted. If not, you weren’t pushing yourself hard enough during the minutes of running.


Repetition is important because it forces your system to absorb oxygen more efficiently. Over time, this raises the maximum amount of oxygen you can have in your blood. The more oxygen you have, the harder and faster you’ll be able to run!, Walk for another five minutes, keeping your pace brisk enough to work out your muscles but slow enough to lower your heartrate. By this point, you should be surprisingly exhausted for such a short workout. If not, you need to raise your heartrate more during the interval training.

, Try to do interval training at least once a week. However, make sure you don't do this exercise more than twice in a ten day period or you may hurt yourself.After a few weeks of interval training, make the exercise harder for yourself by shortening the cooldown time during the interval training to one minute instead of two.


When doing your regular running workout, add five minutes to the normal time you run every week. This will slowly increase your workout and help you gradually improve. If five minutes is too much, start by adding one minute to your regular workout every week.

, Time yourself when you do your regular running workout and record your times in a journal so that you have physical proof of your success. Another good way to measure improvement is to run as fast as you can for as long as you can and record the distance and time. After a few weeks of interval training, you will be able to run faster for farther distances than you could previously.


If you're training to run a race such as a 5k, take a break from your regular workout once every few weeks and run the full 5k. Keep a journal to record your run times. You will start seeing a big improvement after a few weeks of interval training.There are many useful apps for phones that help you track your distance and time. If you don't want to run with your phone, consider purchasing a stopwatch to time yourself and running on a track to accurately measure your distance.

Improve your cadence.,
Work on your posture.,
Adopt proper body positioning.,
Breathe properly.,
Focus on the basics.",How to Improve Your Running Gait2," One way to help your gait is to improve your cadence. Cadence is your running rhythm, that is, how many times your foot hit the ground. Improving your cadence helps you improve your stride by helping you shorten it. Proper cadence helps you have a better gait.The ideal is to have at least 90 steps per minute. You can use running devices with GPS that can log this.
If you don’t have something that will count your steps for you, count the number of steps you land in 15 seconds. You should land 22 or 23 steps in 15 seconds.
Proper cadence of at least 90 strikes per minute will help you refrain from overstriding.

, Posture is very important for your running gait, and a proper gait is impossible with the correct posture. Poor posture causes your body to work harder, your muscles to overwork, and restricts blood and oxygen flow.To get the proper posture, keep your back and spine straight. Don’t make it too straight but try to reduce the bend or slump in your posture. Keep your shoulders back, down, and relaxed with your chin up, looking at the horizon.
You should not bend forward at the waist.

, Holding your body in the proper positions can help improve your gait. Keeping your muscles strong and at the proper place makes your muscles have to work less so you can run more efficiently.Hold your core tight. Your abs, hips, and glutes should be strong and stable while you are running. You shouldn’t be bent forward or moving side to side.
Your arms should be at a 90 degree angle or less. Your arms should be rhythmic and relaxed as they move back and forth. Don’t pump your arms. Keep your hands close to the sides of your body.

, Breathing is important for running. You should learn how to breathe from your belly. Instead of focusing your breath in your chest, you should breathe from lower down.Breathing helps your gait by helping you gain the most efficiency for your effort.


When you breathe, your abdomen should be expanding and contracting instead of your chest. You can practice breathing from your belly when you are at rest, and focus on proper belly breathing while running.
This method of breathing is more efficient, allowing your body to have access to more oxygen as you run.

, Instead of timing yourself or trying to hit the next milestone, focus on the basics. Think about stride length, cadence, breathing, and foot strike. Work on posture and positioning. Just enjoy the feeling of running. Reexamining the basics of your form can help you improve your gait by adjusting any underlying weaknesses.Take a few days or a week and get rid of your watch, GPS tracker, or anything else you use to chart your runs. Instead, just focus on the running.

Work on flexibility.,
Do calf raises.,
Practice high knees.,
Try butt kickers.,
Do a lunge.",How to Improve Your Running Gait3," Flexibility is important for promoting ease of bodily movement. Flexibility for running should not only be in the muscles, but also tendons, ligaments, and joints. Limited flexibility will restrict your body’s movement.With better flexibility, you can increase your hip extension, your calf motion, and the overall movement of your legs, which can help improve your gait.


To increase and maintain flexibility, stretch for a few minutes every day.
Having flexible muscles also helps reduce the chance of pulled muscles.

, Calf raises help both with strength and also with flexibility, which can help reduce calf-related injuries. Calf raises also help increase your cadence, which is one of the most important parts of improving your gait. You should perform this exercise barefoot.Stand on the edge of a step, with the ball of your feet and toes on the step. Move one foot back to where just your toes are resting on the step. Lower the one foot slowly until your heel touches the ground below.
Slowly, lift yourself with both feet. Then, lower yourself with the one foot again.
Perform three sets of 12 to 15 reps on each leg.

, High knees can help improve your hip flexors, along with helping with your stride. Having strength in your hip flexors can help you work on shortening your stride and improving cadence, both pivotal to a better gait. You can do this exercise slowly to work on flexibility, and also do it faster to work with stride.Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. You should contract your abs and keep them tight and strong during this exercise. If you are having trouble balancing, you can do this exercise leaning against a wall.
Bring one leg up while bending the knee. Tighten the glute muscles on the standing leg side to help stabilize. You should lift the leg until it forms a 90 degree angle, the thigh at hip level and parallel to the floor.
Slowly lower the leg and repeat with the opposite leg.
To do this as a faster drill, push the leg up from the ground, bending your knee until it’s at a 90 degree angle and the thigh is parallel to the floor. Let the leg fall using your core to lower the leg with a soft, flat landing.

, Butt kickers help work on the range of motion of your legs. They help improve your cadence and strengthen your recovery, which leads to a better gait. With more practice, you will improve your flexibility, giving your legs more movement.Run in place using only your feet and calves to push off instead of your thighs. Your thighs should remain relatively still. Instead, kick back from the knee so that your heel makes contact with your glutes. Your goal should be to work up to your heel being able to hit your glute.

, Lunges help strengthen your glutes so you can work on your range of motion. Lunges also help work on hip extension and pelvic and torso stabilization. Range, extension, and stabilization helps improve posture, stride, and cadence of your gait.Step forward for a longer stride than your normal stride. Place your weight in your front leg until both knees are at 90 degree angles. Keep your abs tight and stable.
Make sure not to lean your knee over your toes.
Use your glutes to step back to your original standing position.
Do the same with the other leg.

Make sure before you do any sort of running you warm-up well.,
You want to make sure you have a running plan, over training your legs will do more harm than good.

,
For example Monday should be speed(8x200m, sled), Tuesday energy system (4x350m, 6x100m), this is working your speed endurance.,
Before you do any of these workouts it is highly suggested that you be in good shape.

,
After doing your workout for the day, you should do a 5min cool down.",How to Improve Your 400M Time," If you don't you run the risk of pulling a muscle or injuring yourself. A good 30min of warming up is recommended, and some light stretching.;
,, Wednesday over distance(2x600m,2x500m), Thursday mid distance(4x300m,3x200m) and Friday lift weights and do a 3 mile (4.8 km) run.

,, Which could be anything to a mile warm down or simply laps around the track. Then do lots of stretching after.

"
"
Stretch before you begin running.,
Do some leg swings.,
Stretch after you run.,
Do two sets of standing calves.",How to Improve Your Running Speed and Endurance2," It’s important to loosen up your muscles before you begin to exercise. This can prevent injuries and reduces the risk of cramps while you run.Do a set of walking lunges. Take a large step forward with your right leg so that your left leg is extended far behind you. Lower yourself until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Make sure your left knee doesn’t touch the ground and that your right knee is above your right ankle! Repeat for the left leg and do ten lunges per leg.

, Hold on to a sturdy object such as a chair. Stand on one leg and swing your other leg forward and backwards. Make sure to go through your full range of motion; this means swinging your leg up as high as is comfortable and then extending it behind your back as high as you can. Repeat for both legs.


Don’t swing your leg haphazardly or you may hurt yourself. Try to swing your leg in a smooth, controlled motion.

, Even though you’ll be exhausted from running, it’s important to stretch so that your muscles don’t cramp up.Do some standing quads. Stand with your legs together. Bring your left foot behind your back to your left hand, keeping your thighs firmly pressed together. Press your foot with your hand, taking care not to overextend your leg.

, Face a wall and press your palms against the wall at chest-level. Press the ball of your left foot against the wall with your left heel on the ground. Slowly lean towards the wall, taking care not to overextend your foot. Repeat this stretch for your right foot.

"
"
Visit the gym three times a week.,
Do some squats using dumbbells.,
Do some planks.,
Do a set of pushups.",How to Improve Your Running Speed and Endurance3," If you don’t spend time building your muscles at the gym, you can injure yourself running or hit a “performance plateau.” This means that you don’t see any improvement for a long period of time despite training harder and harder., Choose some relatively light dumbbells. Spread your feet about shoulder-width apart and point your toes forward. Hold the dumbbells in your arms down against your side. Lower yourself down into a squatting position, keeping your knees under your toes and extending your rear backwards. Do several repetitions of this exercise., Lie down on the floor or on a yoga mat. Put your hands directly underneath your shoulders a shoulder-width apart. Straighten your back and neck, creating a straight line with your body. Hold this position for a minute before resting. Make sure you keep your back straight – don’t let your hips droop towards the mat or you could injure your back.

, Lie on the floor or on a yoga mat. Place your hands on the floor right next to your armpits, palms down. Push yourself up from the floor using only your arms into a plank position. Once your arms are extended, lower yourself again until your chest is just above the mat. Return to the plank position by extending your arms.Make sure your back stays straight so that you don’t injure yourself.
If regular pushups are too difficult, consider changing your technique. Instead of resting your feet on the ground, rest your knees on the ground and tuck your feet behind you.

Engage in hill training.,
Perform workouts that build your leg muscles.,
Increase the duration and amount of regular exercise.,
Visualize success.,
Incorporate a single longer run each week.,
Interval train once a week.,
Run outside regularly.,
Have one easy running day to recover.,
Talk to a doctor or trainer before starting a new fitness plan.,
Warm up prior to workouts.,
Cool down after workouts.",How to Improve Your 5K Race Time," Hill training is a form of training where you run up and down hill. This can help build endurance and muscle, resulting in faster speeds. Also, you may encounter a hill during a 5k, so hill training can help you prepare.Find a steep hill in a safe area near you. Make sure it's at least 80 to 100 meters long. Start at the bottom of the hill and run up it at a consistent and fast pace. Then, slowly jog back down.
Start slow. Do hill training once a week, engaging in 4 to 5 repetitions. Gradually work your way up to 8 to 10 repetitions. Do what feels right for your body. When 4 to 5 repetitions begins to feel easy, add a one or two more.;
, Strong legs are essential for a fast pace. Squats and and lunges should be a part of your regular workout routine. Start slow with weight training. Only engage in weight training twice a week, doing a small number of repetitions. Never weight train two days in a row.To do a squat, stand with your feet feet hip length apart and your arms at your side. Lower your body as far as you can by pushing your hips down and bending your knees. Raise your arms for balance. Pause for a moment and then lift your body back up.To do a lunge, stand with your upper body straight and your shoulders held back. Step forward with one leg and bend your knee and lower your hips. Keep lowering until both knees are bent at a 90 degree angle. Then, keeping your weight in your heels, push yourself back to the starting position., You can increase endurance and strength by adding a bit more to your regular fitness routine. If you usually ride a stationary bike for 45 minutes a day, add an extra 10 minutes to go a full hour. If you usually do 5 to 10 repetitions of sit-ups or push-ups, add an extra 10 to 20 repetitions., You need to build your mental toughness in addition to your physical toughness to increase your 5k speed. Running fast requires a lot of endurance and dedication. Use visualization to imagine success. Before a run, spend some time imagining yourself successfully finishing the run at a faster speed than normal.Take some time just before you start to run. After putting on your running gear, take a seat for a moment. Close your eyes and imagine.
Make sure to use all your senses. Think about the smells and sounds you'll hear outside. Imagine how your body feels during a run. Think about the sensation of sweat, and the dry taste in your mouth. Think about the smells of cement or the nearby woods you run past.
Imagine finishing the run in record time. Imagine pushing yourself without faltering or growing tired. Then, once you've finished visualizing, exit and take on your run.

, Building endurance can help you run faster. This will increase your aerobic capacity, giving you an extra push to run faster during a 5k.


Strive for one 30 to 45 minute run each week. Make time for a run of this length in your schedule.
You do not need to push yourself to run at extraordinary speeds during your longer run. Strive for a steady, sustainable pace. The point here is to build up endurance.

, Interval training is training where you alternate between a steady pace and bursts of intense speed. Interval training, much like longer runs, can help you build the endurance necessary to sustain a faster pace during a 5k.To start, spend 5 to 10 minutes warming up with a brisk walk or a slow jog.
When you start running, go at your regular pace for a certain distance or time period. There are no set rules for interval training. You can try running at a regular pace for 400 meters, and then speeding up for 100 meters. You could also try jogging at a steady pace for 4 minutes, and then pushing yourself as hard as you can for one minute.
Continue switching between steady paces and quick paces for the normal length or time of your run.

, Running on a treadmill works in a pinch if weather is bad. However, you should mostly stick to running outside when trying to boost your speed in a 5k. A 5k will be held outdoors. Your body should be used to the atmosphere of the outside to adequately prepare. Avoid the treadmill unless the weather is too harsh for an outdoor run.Make sure you choose a safe area to run.
If you're running after sunset, make sure to wear bright colors so you're easily spotted by drivers.

, If you're doing a long or fast run multiple days per week, your body needs time to recover. You need at least one slow run day per week, where you do a slow jog or a brisk walk in lieu of a long, intense run. If you push yourself too much for too long, you'll end up straining your body and crashing., You should never engage in a new fitness plan without talking to a doctor or trainer first. You want to make sure your body is ready for the added strain of extra, harder workouts. A qualified doctor or licensed trainer can help you come up with a training plan that works for your specific needs.

, You should always warm up before a run. This can help prevent muscle strain, soreness, and injury. Take 5 or 10 minutes to engage in a solid warm up before you jump into your regular run.To start, walk for two to five minutes. Then do a slow run for about half a mile, taking frequent walking breaks.
When you begin running, go slowly for the first 10 steps to help your body warm up. Then, increase to your regular pace.

, Never stop abruptly after finishing a run. You should always transition from running to light jogging and then to walking. For 10 minutes after your run, jog slowly with walk breaks. Then, walk for about three to five minutes to allow your body to cool down."

Set a specific training goal to work towards.,
Alternate easy and hard runs to build strength rapidly.,
Focus on explosive stride power through plyometrics.,
Aim for one to two sprint workouts a week to gain speed and power.,
Train your abs and core to ensure strong, efficient posture.,
Eat and hydrate like a professional athlete all week, not just the days you're running.,
Review and improve on your training schedule as you get stronger.",How to Improve Your Running1," Having a goal to work for beyond ""be a better runner"" allows you to tailor your workouts for maximum improvement. Whether you want to run your first 5K, make the cross country team, or cut 10 seconds off of your mile time, think about why you really want to improve. You can then plan accordingly.If you want to start racing, or simply want to make running a more regular habit, consider signing up for a local race. This gives you a concrete date and distance to train for.
If you're trying to make a team or be a better runner for sports, look online for common or recommended workouts for your specific activity, adding it to the advice here.
If you're looking to shave precious seconds off your time, know that you'll need to focus a bit more on strength and power training as well as regular running.;
, It is common for runners to push themselves about the same amount each time, running similarly challenging runs and gradually increasing difficulty. Elite runners, however, alternate an easy, resting run with a very challenge one. It is during these difficult runs, when you really push yourself, that your body makes the most significant gains.Don't feel like an easy day is ""cheating."" Rather, it is helping rebuild and relax the muscles needed for your big runs.
Vary your running routes — even running your normal route backward will provide a new challenge., Every time you run hard, you stretch your quads and hamstrings near their breaking point for a split second. Your body reacts by contracting the muscles quickly to give you power and protection. Plyometrics, which focus on quick, explosive movement, train the body to handle this stress and keep you strong and powerful throughout the run. These exercises are great after a light run, too. Twice a week, do at least 30 minutes of:Try:


Box jumps (use both legs, as well as each leg individually)
Shuttle runs
Single leg hops/leaps
Squat leaps — simply do squat without weight, then jump up and to the side instead of coming straight up
Power skips — how high you can get on each leap?, Sprint workouts aren't just about being a faster sprinter -- the high-energy, powerful steps used at your top speed will help train your muscles to better handle stress at any pace.Some training suggestions include:



Interval Running: Jog lightly for five to 10 minutes. Immediately after, sprint for 30 seconds. Jog for 60 seconds, then sprint for another 30, repeating five to six more times. Jog for five to 10 minutes to cool down.

Ladders: This requires a track or other way to do laps. Jog lightly for five to 10 minutes. When done, sprint a lap at almost 90% top speed. Jog a lap to rest and recover. When done, sprint two laps and jog another lap to recover. Keep escalating the sprint laps until you can no longer push yourself, then jog to cool down for five to 10 minutes., Your core helps transfer energy smoothly from your upper half to lower half. Even more importantly, it helps you stay upright and strong when tired, which helps conserve vital energy. Never neglect your core during training. While not directly felt, strong abs and obliques will lead to more efficient, and thus improved, running.



Crunches and sit-ups, either straight or to the sides.

Planks and other ""hold"" exercises are excellent for building posture and stamina.
Abs can be done every day, or you can choose two to three days a week to do harder and more focused workouts., One of the biggest myths in exercise is that you can ""eat whatever you want"" just because you're running a lot. But you can only burn about 30% of the calories you eat through exercise.Furthermore, the types of calories you consume directly impact how successfully you can run. While dieting properly is it's own topic, some things to remember include to:


Prioritize food that comes from seeds, fruits and vegetables, as they come pre-packed with essential nutrients.
Drink water all day, keeping hydrated before you start running. You want to stay ahead of feeling thirsty, not just drinking once you're parched.
Lean towards lean proteins like chicken, fish, and beans instead of fattier red meats and greasier meats like sausage.
Replace ""empty"" snacks like cookies and candies with vegetables, hummus, yogurt, and low-cal alternatives like pretzels or baked chips.
Recognize that big, heavy, and unhealthy meals can take two to three days to get through your body. Plan before big runs or races accordingly., The better you get, the harder you'll need to push yourself. A good benchmark for any training plan is to ask, ""How hard are the last five to 10 minutes?"" You make the greatest gains when you push through difficulties, so make sure your workouts are still challenging you in order to keep improving.


Working with a partner is often a good way to keep challenging yourself and find motivation to keep working.
Give yourself bigger and harder benchmarks. If you feel good, add a mile to your toughest run, or start incorporating more hills instead of flats.

, People gradually gain the ability to jog for about an hour after they do it everyday for a long time. You should start for about 15-20 minutes and by the end of the month, you should be at about half an hour.

, It can be at the treadmill, or outside. You could think about installing a treadmill in your house. heading to the gym, or outside perhaps on the beach.

, Now that you have set up your time and place for your morning routine if jogging, its time to actually start doing it! Jogging gear should be sweatpants or gym shorts, but not jeans or dress pants. It should be comfy and airy. A tank top or regular t-shirt will do.

, Stretch your arms, legs, neck and shoulders before you do any physical activity.

, You're going to need something to hydrate your body and keep the fluids and blood in your body functioning properly. Water is the best option. Not juice, soda, or energy drinks.

Land each step near the front of your feet, never the heel.,
Focus on your stride rate to make immediate improvements.,
Pull your foot back as it lands, keeping it on the ground for as little time as possible.,
Keep a relaxed but strong upper body to conserve energy efficiently.,
Purchase comfortable, well-fitted running shoes.",How to Improve Your Running2," There is still some discussion about the ""perfect"" landing zone, but there is complete consensus that you should never land on your heel. The back of your foot acts like a brake, slowing you down, which is the last thing you want when running. Try to land just behind the balls of your feet, allowing you to pick up and land your feet quickly.The ball of your foot is the big knob of skin and bone right below your big toe.

, Time yourself running for a minute, counting the number of times your right foot hits the ground. Double this number to get your strides per minute. It should be between 175 – 185 strides in order to run with maximum efficiency. If your stride needs work, try to focus on it just a bit each run instead of correcting it all at once. Within a month you'll see the difference.


Most runners take too big of a stride, meaning their stride rate is too low. To correct it, try leaning slightly forward as you run.
If you run with music, find the songs that help you keep a good rhythm. Many runners look for songs at 180 beats per minute to help naturally time themselves. You can find 180 BPM playlists online and on running forums., When you land, keep your knees slightly bent. Focus on pulling your landing foot backward, towards you butt, as soon as it lands. This push-off motion should be backward, not up, transferring your motion efficiently forward as you run instead of bouncing up and down., You want to keep your chin up and your shoulders back, with loose, relaxed arm and hand muscles. Your elbows are bent at 90 degrees but swing freely. Though it's often forgotten about, remember to relax your face and neck muscles as well instead of tensing them. If anything, the only muscles you want to focus on keeping strong and tight are the ones in your core, as this will naturally keep your posture strong and help you efficiently channel energy., Training on good shoes is not just about your feet. The right shoes will help promote good posture and proper form, as well as prevent injuries. That's because an uncomfortable shoe usually makes you land or take off differently to avoid pain, which only creates more problems down the line. When buying shoes, look for a pair in which:


Your heel stays snugly in the shoe.
You have room to wiggle your toes.
The balls and arches of your feet are hugged by the shoe, but not so tight you lose circulation."
"
Use a diverse, active warm up to cut time off of any run or race.,
Use your light run to work up a light sweat.,
Gradually add high knees, butt kicks, and shuffling into your warm-up run.,
Activate your hips before you start with lunges, hip openers, and skips.,
Use static stretching lightly, prioritizing it after a workout instead of before.,
Hydrate throughout the day, as well as right before you start.",How to Improve Your Running3," The old strategy of static stretching (""reach down and touch your toes"") has been shown, on its own, to actually decrease muscle efficiency.To really improve how you run, you should improve how you warm up. A sample regiment might be:


Walk or jog lightly for five to 10 minutes
Two to three minutes ""special"" running (high knees, butt kicks, skips)
Two to three minutes lunges, side-shuffles, and hip openers
Two to three minutes light static stretching, ""Warming up"" truly means you want to warm up your body. A higher body temperature ensures your muscles are loose and pliable, and your body is pumping blood effectively throughout. For everything other than easy runs (when you'll be at this pace the entire time), use the first five to 10 minutes to build a light sweat and get your body primed for exercise.


Even five minutes of walking is a good way to get started.
Slowly pick up speed for short 10 second sprints, then return to normal warm-up pace. This helps prime your muscles for speed., These are exaggerated runs that warm up specific muscles and help your legs prepare for a full range of motion. Do each of these ""dynamic stretches"" for at least a minute.



High Knees: With every step, lift each knee up to hip height.

Butt Kicks: Exaggerate lifting your back leg so your heel comes up and taps your buttocks.

Shuffle Step: Turn sideways and move horizontally for three to four steps. Pivot on your front foot and face the other direction, shuffling for three to four steps before alternating again.

Backwards Jogging: Focus on really extending your stride behind you, reaching those feet backward with each step., In it's simplest mechanical form, running is just a series of single-leg squats done over and over again. What this teaches you is that your hips must be open and loose to effectively transfer energy and improve your pace. To warm them up:



Lunges are when you step forward with one foot, then lower the back knee toward the ground. Keep your toes pointed forward and lower your hips to the ground. Do not let your knee pass over your toes.

Hip Openers are simply picking your knee up and then rotating it out to the side, exposing your inner thigh to face in front of you. Take two to three jogging steps, open the hip, then repeat with the other leg.

Skipping: Take each skip as high as you can get it, treating them more like individual leaps. Bring your knee up high with each bound., After your dynamic stretches, a light static stretch can help loosen up any muscles that are still tight. You want to be sure, however, that you don't push any one stretch to a painful level. You want to feel a stretch, but it shouldn't ever hurt.


Static stretching is a great way to end runs, as your muscles are already warm and pliable. This can help prevent some soreness later., A good goal to aim for is a glass of water each hour up until you set out on your run. Instead of gulping something down at the last minute, keep sipping water up until the run to stay comfortable and cramp-free.Remember that the best way to hydrate is not just right before a run, but the entire day leading up to it.

"
Check your running form.,
Time a run.,
Add 5 - 10 minutes a week.,
Don't worry about your pace.,
Fuel your body properly.,
Stick with your training plan.,
Don't push too hard.",How to Run Longer1," Before you aim to run longer, it's a good idea to make sure you've mastered the basics. Using awkward form might not make a difference when you're only running a couple of miles, but when you add more time and mileage your running form makes a bigger difference.


Pump your arms and take comfortable strides.
Relax your upper body instead of holding it stiff.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Make sure you're running in a comfortable pair of shoes that fit your feet well.;
, Before trying to add time, see exactly what you have to work with. Wear a watch on your next run and time yourself. You'll be adding time in small increments, so it's a good idea to know what your starting point will be.


Run as long as you can before needing to stop. Try to keep going even after you feel tired and your legs start aching. You likely have a little more endurance than you realize, since a big part of being able to run longer is having the ability to deal with some discomfort.
Consider setting a goal based on your starting time. If you can run 15 minutes, your goal might be to make it to 30. If you can run 30, maybe you want to be able to run for an hour.

, It might not sound like much, but adding 5 - 10 minutes per week, depending on your initial endurance level, will build up very quickly. This is a good, steady amount of time to add to help you run longer without jumping ahead too fast and over-straining your muscles. Make a commitment to running the extra time, even if it's a struggle - that's how you build endurance.


If your first timed run lasted under 30 minutes, start by adding 5 minutes next time. Keep adding 5 minutes week after week until you can run for 30.
If your first timed run was over 30 minutes, add 10 minutes per week. Keep adding 10 minutes per week (and no more) until you reach your goal.

, You can work on your speed later - for now, just focus on the goal of running longer. Your pace should be easy enough that you can have a conversation while you run. Run at a pace you feel like you could keep up indefinitely. Pushing yourself to run both faster and longer could lead to burnout, so if you're concerned about speed, make it a goal to run faster after you've reached your goal to run for a certain amount of time., What you eat and drink before working out matters. If you feel heavy or bloated, you won't be able to run as long. It's very important to be completely hydrated and sated with nutrients so you'll be able to endure the entire run.While you need to have fuel in your body, it's not necessary to ""carbo-load"" before a run. This can actually really slow you down. Unless you're running a marathon, your body really doesn't need a rush of carbohydrates to complete the run.
Try eating a handful of almonds, a banana, or half a bagel with peanut butter about an hour before you run. This should be sufficient to get you through the run without weighing you down.
Don't hydrate with sports drinks - just drink water instead. Again, your body doesn't need the extra sugar to perform well. In the end, the extra calories will just make it more difficult to stay in good shape.

, Building endurance happens when you make a plan and keep at it, week after week. If you skip a few weeks of running, your fitness level will drop a bit and you'll have to build it back up again. If you end up needing to take an extended break because life gets in the way of training, that's OK - just get back out there and start adding time again. Fitness is a work in progress, and you're going to have super-fit times and not-so-fit times - that's just part of the game.

, Attempting to skip ahead in your plan and add more than 10 minutes per week will backfire on you. Your body needs time to slowly build muscle and fitness, and if you try to push too hard you could injure yourself or simply get burned out. You'll be more successful if you build endurance slowly but surely.Make sure to incorporate rest days into your routine. Don't run every single day - you should rest at least 1 or 2 days a week to give your muscles a chance to heal and rest.
On the days when you don't run, you can cross train. Try biking, swimming, or hiking as an alternative.

Friday.,
Saturday and Sunday.",How to Get Into Sprinting (Beginners)," This is your Speed day. This day's running exercises focuses on making your legs and body explosive, while building fast twitch muscle fibers, which is the key to running fast. In all of the exercises you do today, you want to be going as fast as you possibly can. Push yourself.


Warm up by jogging around the track for 5 minutes. Don't tire yourself out, since you will be needing that extra stamina later on.
Do some stretching exercises. These are some easy ones, that will soften you up before taking on the first exercise: http://exercise.about.com/b/2010/09/15/why-you-need-to-stretch.htm


Exercise 1. We'll start off with running 80m five times (5x80m), with a 3 minute rest in-between. If you don't know, 100m is the one side of the oval track you are running on. There should be an 80m mark. If not, just don't run all the way to the finish line. Running with the proper form is important, and this video explains perfectly how to run properly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ38yE39NYI. If you feel like the language is too damn hard, watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BmtGNjm7BE. Between the exercises, take 10 min break, drink some water, let your pulse go down.

Exercise 2. 4x70m, with a 3 minute rest in-between. You'll figure out about where 70m are. It's not that important to be precise.

Exercise 3. 3x60m, with a 3 minute rest in-between.

Exercise 4. 2x20m, with a 3 minute rest in-between.
That's Monday. Let's move on.;
, This is Gym day. On this day you will hit the gym to build up the strength needed to sprint faster. The most important muscles needed for sprinting are your legs, shoulders, and core. Follow this set of exercises specifically for training the muscles needed to sprint: https://www.wikihow.com/Gym-Exercises-for-Beginner-Sprinters.

, Endurance training. This is for improving your stamina, so that you are able to keep going when the lactic acid sets in at the end of your run. It's good for your heart too.


Warmup for 10 minutes.
Stretch.

Exercise 1. You will only run 300m two times, but you will run it as fast as you possibly can. If you aren't completely wasted after one set of 300m you are doing it wrong. Rest until you feel like you can do it again.
The 300m is 3/4 of one full lap around the track. The two straights on the track is 100m each, and the two bends are 100m each.

, Semi-speed day. Today we incorporate the endurance and the speed training into one. Today you will run the two most popular sprint distances, the 100m dash, and the 200m dash. You'll finish of with a nice sprint of 50m.



Warmup like Monday

Stretch.

Exercise 1. Start with the 200m. You will do this 3 times. Don't push yourself as hard as you can, since you will most likely stop at 150m and be exhausted by then. Begin with a good, fast pace, and start accelerating at 130m. Rest 5-10 minutes in-between

Exercise 2. Next we have the 100m. The real deal. You'll run this twice. Push as hard as you can. Rest 5-10 minutes in-between.

Exercise 3. We'll finish of with one 50m dash. Push it boy!
Stretch.

, Gym day. Exactly like Tuesday.

, REST.

,How to Run a Half Marathon1,
"
Walk when you need to.,
Run sprints.,
Do plyometrics.,
Rotate hard days with easy days.,
Try tempo runs.,
Stay engaged - or not.",How to Run Longer2," When you're building up endurance, you're likely to experience some discomfort as you add time to your runs. You'll get to the point where you feel like you can't take another step. That's OK - you can slow down and walk for a bit. Walk until you feel able to run, then start running again. Keep rotating between walking and running until you've been working out for the amount of time you set out to run.


The run/walk strategy is especially helpful if you're a beginner runner. Try to increase the time you're running and decrease the time you're walking with each subsequent workout. Eventually, you'll be able to run the entire time.

, Doing high-intensity interval training has been shown to increase the body's maximal oxygen uptake - known as VO2 max - which is the standard measure or aerobic fitness.That means that running sprints a few times a week will help you build the endurance to run longer at a slower pace. Try the following routine 2 to 3 times a week for about 6 weeks:


Warm up completely. Sprinting puts a lot of pressure on your muscles, and warming up will help prevent injury.
Sprint for 30 seconds at 50 percent capacity. Rest for 2 minutes.
Sprint for 30 seconds at 80 percent capacity. Rest for 2 minutes.
Sprint for 30 seconds at 100 percent capacity. Rest for 2 minutes.
Repeat for a total of up to 8 sprints depending on your fitness level.

, Boot camp-style exercises like skipping drills and high-knee sprints have been used to great success by some athletes to improve endurance.These exercises build core muscles and tone the entire body. Incorporating plyometrics helps athletes run longer, faster. You can work with a personal trainer to use your gym's equipment to complete a plyometrics routine 2 - 3 times a week. Alternatively, try the following workout:


Run 20 yards (18.3 m) using the shortest, quickest stride you can do. Repeat 6 times.
Do a total of 5 minutes of the following exercises: single-leg hops, jump roping, and high-knee skipping.

, This strategy is used by marathoners who add distance every week. During the week, do 2 or 3 shorter, intense runs - hard runs during which you run faster and with more effort. On the weekend, do your longest run at an easy, conversational pace. You'll find the longer runs to be more pleasant than the shorter ones, even though you're covering more distance and running for a longer amount of time.

, A tempo run is one that starts with 15 minutes at an easy pace, then 20 minutes at a comfortably hard pace (not a sprint), and finishes with 15 minutes at an easy pace. Adding one or two tempo runs to your workout will increase the body's lactate threshold, the point at which the body fatigues while running a certain pace., In order to keep your mind occupied and away from thoughts of feeling tired, try listening to an MP3 player during your run. Alternatively, you might prefer the quiet time to relax your mind and focus only on your running. Do whatever works best for you and helps you push through the discomfort your body will feel as you gain endurance.

"
"
Assess your level of fitness.,
Next, choose your half marathon event.

,
Many charitable organizations hold marathons, half marathon and 5K races to raise money for their causes.,
Register for your half marathon event.",How to Run a Half Marathon2," Decide if you are ready to run a half marathon.


Before you run a half marathon, you should be able to complete a 3-mile (5 km) jog or run at least 3 times per week.
At the very least, you should be able to run at a steady pace for 30 minutes.

,, If you are interested in a specific cause, such as environmentalism, animal rights or cancer research, look for an event that contributes to it.

,


Register early, as many half marathons fill up many months before the event.
Registration information may also include special requirements, such as minimum finish times, which you should account for in your training goals.

"
"
Begin your training at least 12 weeks prior to the date of your half marathon event.

,
Find running trails or circuits where you can accurately judge the distance, such as a local track or a neighborhood sidewalk (which you can measure the distance of in your car).

,
Create a training calendar and post it in a prominent place to help you stay motivated every day of your training.

,
Spend your first 2 weeks running 3 miles (4.8 km) twice, with a 4-mile (6.4 km) run at the end of the week.

,
Increase your short run by half a mile (0.8 km) every 2 weeks, while increasing your long run at the end of the week by 1 mile (1.6 km).

,
Increase your long run by 1 mile (1.6 km) every week when you reach the last 3 to 4 weeks of your training, so that you complete a 10-mile (16 km) run the week before your half marathon event.

,
Leave at least one day between each run.,
Devote 1 day each week to stretching and strength training with light to moderate weights.,
Rest for 1 day each week.",How to Run a Half Marathon3,",,,,,, Spend these days doing short jogs that are less than 3 miles (4.8 km) each, or cross training with other sports or fitness activities, such as swimming or biking.

, You may like to enroll in a yoga or Pilates class to make sure that you prioritize these days in your training.

, Avoid any activity more strenuous than casual walking on your rest days.

"
"
Lower your level of training the week before you run a half marathon.,
Rest for the two days prior to the half marathon event.,
Eat a light, nutritious meal prior to your race, and stick with the foods you typically eat during your training.,
Pack your running gear, such as a timer and glycogen, and a change of clothes the night before the race.,
Stretch slowly and thoroughly after you cross the finish line to aid in your recovery.

",How to Run a Half Marathon4," Reduce the distance of your runs to 2 to 4 miles (3.2 to 6.4 km) each, and spend less time cross training.

, Get lots of sleep! Definitely at least eight hours per night.

, Bring drinks and a snack for after the race as well.

, Lay out your running clothes ahead of time for less stress on the day of the event.

,"
"
Clip toenails and place Vaseline between toes, on heels, under arms, and anywhere skin or clothing can chaff, to avoid blisters.,
Put band aids over nipples.,
Bring a trash bag with a hole cut on the top crease for your head.,
Take a Tylenol at the start of the race and another at mile 17.,
Drink water or an energy drink at each stop.,
Don't let the crowd and your adrenaline push you to start too fast.,
Don't experiment on race day by wearing new shoes or trying the latest carbohydrate snack.,
Don't overeat during the race.,
Don't plan to run the whole race with your friend.,
Don't fill up on free beer after the race.",How to Run a Successful First Marathon,";
, When shirts get wet with perspiration or from rain, nipples can rub raw, bleed, and sting.

, Wearing the bag retains body heat on chilly marathon mornings and can be tossed just before the race starts.

, Tylenol reduces inflammation and discomfort, especially as the race progresses.

, By the time you are thirsty, you're already dehydrated.

, Starting too fast is the surest way to guarantee you don't finish.

, Stay with what's comfortable and familiar.

, You'll have an opportunity to eat bananas, candy, bagels and other foods during the race. Eating too much will slow you down and make you sick. Never eat food offered by spectators.

, People rarely run the same pace over 26.2 miles (42.2 km). Either you or your friend will want to run more quickly and likely will force the other to run at a faster than usual pace. Instead, agree to cut each other loose and meet up at a designated place after the race.

, You deserve one but remember, you still have to drive home."
"
Start training well in advance of a running event, and start slowly.,
Add incline running to your training regime.,
Stretch your muscles before and after long distance running training.,
Eat properly.,
Practice drinking.",How to Prepare for Running Long Distance,"


Begin with a 15 minute jog and work your way up from there, gauging your comfort level as you go.
Increase your time as much as you can without overexerting yourself. You should be able to hold a simple conversation while running without losing your breath.
Give yourself 3 to 6 months to build to marathon running capabilities.;
, This will help to improve your cardiovascular health and muscle strength. Increase your speed, called ""checking out,"" for the entirety of the uphill run, and then for 10 seconds after the downhill turn.

, Developing flexibility will help with injury prevention. Be sure to hold each stretch for at least 30 seconds to fully stretch and relax the muscles.

, There are certain foods that work toward promoting strong muscles and lasting energy, and other foods that will zap your energy when you are running long distance. Long distance runners should adhere to the following guidelines:


Maintain a nutrient ratio of 20 percent proteins, 30 percent fats and 50 percent carbohydrates.
Avoid simple sugars and instead focus on complex carbohydrates such as those found in fruits, pastas, legumes, breads and vegetables.
Make sure you are taking in plenty of calories. An average runner who runs between 20 miles (32 km) and 25 miles (40 km) per week should take in around 2,500 calories a day. The more you run, the more you need to eat in order to maintain your body's muscle glycogen stores.
Load up on carbohydrates the night before a marathon running race to ensure optimal energy stores during the race itself.
Supplementing your diet with a good multivitamin and even an energy supplement like ginseng is a good way to gain an edge.

, As a long distance runner, it is imperative that you drink enough fluids, and you must learn how to appropriately stay hydrated during a race. Drinking too much, too little, too often or not often enough while running long distance can result in choking, nausea, dehydration and/or wasting precious time during the race. Be sure to carry plenty of water with you at all times during practice so that you can get the feel for when to drink, how much to drink and how often. Here are some general rules of thumb for training to drink appropriately:


Start loading your system with fluids up to 2 hours before marathon running, but stop at the 2 hour mark so as to avoid having to visit the restroom.
Drink throughout the run, from the beginning to the end. You will sweat off your liquids before they reach your bladder, so remember to rehydrate often.
Walk while you are drinking. Do not attempt to gulp while running. This could result in choking and coughing, and could end up slowing you down more.
Continue to drink well after your run.
Check your urine for ample hydration. It should be clear.

Calculate the total amount of funds raised from all sources (minus expenses) and submit the funds to the organization.

",How to Organize a Marathon,"


Once you've identified a charity, entity, or cause to support, choose a name for the event that is descriptive and easy to remember. Be sure to contact the organization you will be conducting the event for to see if they have any specific guidelines that you need to adhere to.;
, If the location is a popular one, you may need to have either a few back up dates or back up locations in mind.


For a run or walk, select a course and carefully measure distances. Have both a short and a long version to accommodate participants of varying degrees of fitness. Be attentive to obstacles, challenges, or safety hazards that may exist along the course and plan accordingly.

, Research similar events to determine estimated costs of various activities that could be included in your event.


Determine how your event will be financed and how much it will cost. Be sure to include administrative costs such as advertising, banners for the start and finish lines, numbers for participants, refreshments, trash cans, portable bathroom facilities, and awards.
Calculate how much money you will have to raise and identify potential fundraising options, including estimates of how much you expect to raise from each funding source. If you plan to solicit large contributions in the form of corporate sponsorships, start discussions with the appropriate corporate representatives as early as possible as these negotiations often take time.







, Find out what type of medical and/or liability insurance you will need and make sure that you have sufficient insurance coverage prior to the event.


You may need to contact the local police and fire department, public works, the parks and recreation department, and private property owners.







,


Use flyers, posters, signs, brochures, word of mouth and press releases to spread the word. Take advantage of social networking by creating buzz for your marathon networking websites. You may even want to set up a blog or website to publicize your event and to share up-to-date information with supporters.

,


These include refreshments (particularly bottled water for a run or walk), cups, numbers for your participants, trash cans/bags and t-shirts. Don't forget awards for your winners and you may also want to provide a small gift of some sort to thank your volunteers.

, Make sure that there are no unexpected changes, safety hazards, obstacles, or anything else that might negatively impact the race.

, Assign volunteers to each item and make sure each of them knows what they will be responsible for during the event.

,,, Be sure to leave it as close to the condition you found it as possible.

, Use the same social networking venues and a local press release or news article to publicly thank participants, sponsors and volunteers as well.

Start each workout with running.,
Plan the next 12 weeks according to this regimen: split running with strength-training 4 days per week, do 1 long trail run and rest for 2 days.,
Run trails at least 2 days per week.,
Do interval training.,
Increase your cardio runs incrementally for 12 weeks.,
Start your 12-week regimen with bodyweight exercises and simple weight training.,
Add kettle bells, weights and sand bells after 1 to 2 weeks.,
Add plyometric training during your fifth week of training.,
Add Tabata intervals at 6 to 7 weeks.,
Do your body weight exercises outside.,
Get some dry wicking fabric for your training.,
Pour a bucket of ice-cold water over yourself and go for a run or do your Tabata intervals each week.,
Get dirty.,
Do hill intervals or Tabata exercises with friends.,
Look at the racecourse as soon as it is posted.",How to Train for a Tough Mudder," All-terrain running is a major component of a Tough Mudder. You want to start by running at least 2 miles (3.2 km) and work your way up to at least 10.;
, Schedule your long run and your rest days strategically, so that it does not adversely affect your other plans.


If you have signed up for the Tough Mudder with a team, you may want to sync several of your workouts with the teammates. Working out in tandem will help you push yourself harder.
Most Tough Mudder teams are comprised of 5 to 10 people.

, In fact, the larger the number of trail runs you do per week, the better off you will be on race day. Trail running combines hills for better cardio training and soft earth for better balance.

, Incorporate hill intervals or stair intervals as the weeks go on. When you run, sprint for 1/4 of a mile and jog to catch your breath.


Don’t walk between intervals. You will not have the opportunity to walk during a Tough Mudder. You will go from running to obstacles and repeat for 10 miles (16 km).

, On the 4 days you also do strength training, do lower amounts of cardio. Here is an example running program for a 12-week lead up:


Week 1: Do a 1.5-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 2-mile trail run 2 other days. Do a 3-mile trail run. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs).
Week 2: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 2-mile trail run 2 days. Do a 3.5-mile trail run. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs).
Week 3: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 3-mile trail run 2 days. Do a 4-mile trail run another day. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs).
Week 4: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 2-mile run/jog interval 2 days. Do a 5-mile run another day. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs).
Week 5: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 1 day and a 3-mile run/jog interval 2 days. Do a 5.5-mile all-terrain run on another day. Replace 1 day of strength training/running with plyometrics.
Week 6: Do a 1-hour run/jog day, a 50-minute hill interval day and a 6-mile run day. Replace a treadmill run and strength training workout with 1 plyometrics routine and a Tabata interval day (See below for explanation).
Week 7: Do a 1-hour run/jog day, a 50-minute hill interval session day, a plyometrics routine day, a Tabata interval day and a 6.5-mile all terrain run.
Week 8: Do 65 minutes of run/jog intervals 1 day, 50 minutes of hill intervals another day, a plyometrics day, a Tabata day and a 7-mile all-terrain run.
Week 9: Do 2 Tabata training days of at least 50 minutes, do 50-minute hill intervals twice per week and run a 7.5-mile all-terrain trail.
Week 10: Continue 50-minutes of Tabata training twice per week, do hill intervals twice per week and do an 8-mile trail run.
Week 11: Continue the same as last week, pushing to 8.5 or 9 miles (13.7 or 14.5 km) during your long run, if you choose.
Week 12: Do a single 5-mile all-terrain run, a 30-minute treadmill run and a 40-minute Tabata session in the week you prepare for your race. , Bodyweight exercise means that you will use your own body’s weight for resistance. You will do these exercises 3 times per week, every other day.


Start with 30 minutes of pushups, pull-ups, burpees, lunges, and squats.
Do 20 repetitions of each of these exercises with short rests in between.
Do these exercises on the same day as your shorter runs. The run will serve to warm up your muscles.
Do upper body weightlifting, like bicep curls, flys, presses and tricep curls after you complete the bodyweight exercises.

, By week 3, you should be using 7 to 30 lb. (3.1 to 13.6kg) weights to increase your resistance during weightlifting and bodyweight exercises.


Be conservative when you use weights. It’s better to start with a smaller weight and increase it later than to injure yourself with heavy weights.
You can also use a weighted vest during cardio or outside training to increase resistance.
Tailor your plan to address your weakest muscles. , Plyometrics are explosive interval exercises that combine jumping, speed and strength training. The following exercises should be performed with 3 sets of 12 reps and a short jogging rest in between.


Do box jumps. Start on the ground and jump onto a high bench, platform or wooden box.
Do squat jumps. When you get to the lowest point of a squat, jump high in the air. Land upright and squat again immediately.
Do power skipping. Cover rough terrain quickly by skipping for 1 minute, just as you did when you were a kid.
Do lateral jumps. Set up cones. Jump to the right side and jump back. Repeat.
Do pushups. Lower yourself down to the ground, then press your arms against the ground in an explosive motion. You should lift yourself off the ground each time.
Do plyometric exercises for 30 to 40 minutes at a time. These exercises are harder on your joints, so take rest days and don’t push yourself to injury. , Do this exercise for 60-minutes with at least a day’s rest between plyometrics and Tabata intervals. You will choose at least 6 exercises to repeat in 4-minute sets. Do the exercise at full intensity for 20 seconds, and then rest for 10 seconds. Repeat this interval 8 times, until you reach 4-minutes. Rest for 1 minute with a walk or jog, and then do another Tabata protocol with a different exercise.
Good exercises include sprints, mountain climbers, skater jumps, cycling, pushups, lunges and boxing.

, Better yet, find a ropes course or outdoor exercise equipment at your local park. A gym environment is too comfortable to imitate a Tough Mudder race. , If you only have cotton workout gear, you should get used to wearing tight-fitting workout shorts, shirts or suits. Cotton carries extra weight and will make you chafe. Wear gloves with the tips of the fingers cut off during hard training and race day. It will help you grip while you are in mud and water.

, The shock will mimic the cold-water obstacles you will experience.

, Go trail running while it’s raining, if you get a chance. It may be your only chance to get used to running in mud.

, As you sprint or finish your set, cheer each other on.

, Although there will be some mysteries, you can adjust your routine to train for whatever the course has to offer.

Sign up!",How to Qualify for the Boston Marathon," Match it with the time you will need to run in a prior marathon in order to qualify:;
, Do this by doing the total time in minutes divided by 26.2. For example, a 25 year-old male will have to run 185 minutes/26.2 miles=7.06 minutes per mile. If you want to know exactly how many seconds .06 minutes is, just multiply that by 60. In this case, the man will have to run under 7 minutes 4 seconds per mile for all 26.2 miles to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

, It is often said that you must be able to run a 5k (3.1 miles) in under 19 minutes as a baseline in order to be physiologically capable of accomplishing such a task. This is because runners and endurance athletes in general can really only increase their VO2 max (maximum volume of oxygen an athlete’s body can use) by 15% which has been directly implicated with how long and fast you can run. Be realistic with yourself, as some peoples’ bodies simply are not capable of sustaining such a pace no matter how well trained.

, Do you have an extra 10-20 hours per week to dedicate to running? Do you regularly sleep 7-9 hours a night? If so, plan on integrating a specific daily running schedule into your everyday life. Interestingly enough, professional runners run 12-18 times per week (2-3 times per day)! You do not need to do this, but be aware the training will be rigorous.


Many professionals argue that sleep is the most integral part of success as an athlete. As mentioned above, this is when human growth hormone is released which has myriad muscular benefits. While asleep, the body recovers especially quickly as well. If you do not sleep regularly, you will not reap many of the benefits associated with quality rest (7-9 hours is adequate, but the more the merrier). Professional endurance athletes frequently sleep 10-12 hours throughout the day, including a nap (this allows for a double shot of human growth hormone—once at night, and once during the nap).

, Marathon training plans are typically 18 weeks but may vary depending on what shape you begin at and how fast you want to run. Pasted above is a more advanced training program, but feel free to modify it to fit your daily needs or look up more basic ones online:

, Do not skip runs, as this will come back to bite you in the butt on race day. Mental toughness is the biggest immeasurable variable come race day. Many elite athletes will lose to people who are far less fit but much more mentally strong. Ask yourself if you are mentally tough enough to fight through the pain. Almost everybody will say yes at this point, but during the 20th mile of the marathon, you will no doubt be exhausted.


Many runners hit the ‘wall,’ which occurs when the body is completely depleted of glycogen fuel sources (also known as ‘bonking’). This means the body must burn fat and protein as fuel, which is much more difficult and strenuous. One way to test yourself is to go on a long run—20 miles (32.2 km) or so—and hit the wall to see if you are mentally strong enough to push through. It is estimated that the great majority of runners only achieve 70-80% of their full fitness potential, and this is directly due to the lack of mental toughness.

, The simplest way is to do some high altitude training , which will benefit you immensely.


Conditioning in high altitudes, where the oxygen content in the air is more dispersed (less oxygen in each breath), increases the strain placed on your lungs and heart. The body responds to this by releasing erythropoietin (erythro=red, poietin=growth), a hormone that stimulates red blood cell (scientifically known as erythrocytes) production. An increase in red blood cell count will allow you to run faster and longer. This can be instrumental in your qualification and preparation for the Boston Marathon, and it does not take long to achieve—14 days at 6,500 feet or above is ample time for your body to acclimatize.
You may be familiar with erythropoietin (EPO) as this was the drug that Lance Armstrong took to become a faster biker. This is the artificial form, but the kidneys also produce this hormone regularly, and it can be very beneficial to endurance athletes.

, As mentioned above, this is when human growth hormone (HGH) is released which has myriad muscular benefits. While asleep, the body recovers especially quickly as well. If you do not sleep regularly or do not have time to do so, you will not reap many of the benefits associated with quality rest (7-9 hours is adequate, but the more the merrier). Professional endurance athletes frequently sleep 10-12 hours throughout the day, including a nap (this allows for a double shot of human growth hormone—once at night, and once during the nap).


HGH’s release from the brain at night strengthens bones, muscles, and burns fat. It also curbs ghrelin, which is a hormone that induces hunger—thereby causing weight loss.

, Especially focus on fruits and vegetables to maintain healthy red blood cell production and muscle toning. This will help increase your time and keep your heart strong for the entirety of the training regimen and race. It will also help you lose weight and increase your VO2 max.

, If you have already run a marathon with the corresponding qualifying time, feel free to just head to the Boston Athletic Association website to sign up for the next annual Boston Marathon (registration is typically open during September, and the race is held in the subsequent April). Good luck!

Over the next two months progress to running six days a week (train twice a day on some days) and logging anywhere from 40–70 miles (64–113 km) in each week depending on your ability.;
, This should include one day on the track running intervals. These are usually short distances that you run at a fast pace multiple times with short rest. A good place to start would be 3 x 1600 m (1 mi) at 5k (3.1 mi) pace with 3 minutes rest in between. As the season progress increase the number of repetitions, shorten the distance, shorten the rest, and increase the pace until you reaching a peaking point right before your final race.

, Find a moderately steep hill and do 6 - 10 100 m (1/16 mi) sprints at around 80% sprint capacity. These will help tremendously with upper body strength and with the final kick in any race.

, Membership in a gym is not necessary. Simple exercises such as push-ups and crunches are all that a distance runner needs. It is important to work these areas as their strength will promote a more efficient running form.

, Carbs are good but stay away from sugars and fatty foods. For some people this is very important but for others it may make little difference.

, You should be drinking water at least once an hour especially on warm days.

, Stress doesn't help anyone. A few minutes of meditation before you warm up is a good practice.

, That means get out in front, don't let yourself get boxed in, but do not full out sprint.

, Know your goal pace ahead of time and shoot for it. The first lap will feel easy and that's okay but if you do go too fast do not slow down as you will most likely over correct. Instead just keep your pace as your body will naturally adjust.

, Remember that this is your own race and you should never feel obligated to stay with anyone.

, By this time you will be in pain but you need to dig in and push it hard here. If you can begin working your way to lead only passing on the straight-aways. Note that this is the hardest and the most important lap. You will hurt just as much no matter how fast you run so make it count here.

, If there's anyone left to pass try to do it on the far side straight-away. A good runner wins a race long before the last 100 m (1/16 mi). As you hit the 200 m (1/8 mi) mark slowly begin your final kick and pull hard all the way to finish.

, Instead of slowly accelerating to a full sprint do so instantly when your opponent least expects and carry through all the way to finish. Even if they're a faster sprinter than you, more often than you will prevail as the head start is difficult to overcome.

, Make sure you do a cool down jog for about ten minutes and stretch afterwards.

Choose a training plan.",How to Train for a Half Marathon After a Heart Attack1," Prior to training for a half marathon, you should ask your doctor to perform an exercise test to determine your fitness level.Based on this exercise test, your doctor will be able to give you a sense of what type of exercise you should be doing and whether you should sign up for the half marathon.;
, If you are thinking about doing a half marathon, it may be wise to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of various exercise plans. Then, if your doctor approves, you can go ahead and sign up for a half marathon event. You might consider asking the following questions:


Is there an exercise plan you would recommend for me?What types of physical activity do you recommend?Do you run? What are your thoughts on running in races after a heart attack?

, It is good to figure out your doctor’s level of interest in running as a sport and related health concerns. Your doctor may know a lot about heart health but not a lot about running or a lot about both heart health and running. To determine your doctor’s experience and knowledge of sport, running, and health, ask the following questions:


Are you interested in fitness and cardiovascular health?
Are you certified by the American Board of Cardiology?
Are you a member of the American College of Sports Medicine?, You should understand the risks of cardiac arrest and fatality before participating in a half marathon. In particular, you should know that participating in a half marathon will increase your risk of cardiac arrest and fatality relative to being sedentary during those same hours.Research suggest that half marathons are associated with a low level of risk of cardiac arrest and fatality, but the risk is greater among male participants.There has been an increase of cardiac arrest among male participants at marathons and half marathons over the past decade.In a study of marathon deaths between 2000 and 2009, the median age of deaths was 41.5 years of age.Risk of exercise-related death in people who run distances between 10K and half-marathon are 3.1 deaths per million finishers., Although daily exercise helps to decrease the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, you can overdo it. The benefits of exercise for cardiovascular health are weakened if you run more than 7.1 kilometers (4.4 miles) a day or walk more than 10.1 kilometers (6.2 miles) a day.In a typical half marathon training program, you will be running 12.5 kilometers (7.7 miles) in the first week and 21.1 kilometers (13.5 miles) at the actual half-marathon. These distances are in excess of what is recommended if you want to reduce your risk of death from cardiovascular disease.Consider running less than 7.1 kilometers (4.4 miles) per day.Consider walking less than 10.1 kilometers (6.2 miles) a day., The first step is to decide whether you want to walk or run the half marathon. Although running is a popular way of doing a half marathon, most events have a walking category.

, The most important step in planning for your half marathon is to set a realistic goal. A realistic goal will include some consideration of your heart condition, physiological profile, experience level, and time for training.If you set a goal that is realistic, you will be much more likely to have a positive experience.

, There are a wide variety of half marathon training plans available, including training plans for walking and running. Typically, a half marathon training program lasts sixteen weeks and includes weekly long runs that gradually increase in distance until you are able to complete the full half marathon distance of 21.1 kilometers (13.5 miles).Depending on the plan, you will have to complete other weekly runs or walks that focus on other aspects of training such as speed and maintaining a regular pace.The three plus two training program for the half marathon includes three runs per week as well as two cross training workouts. The key runs include weekly track repeats, a tempo run, and a long run that gradually increases to build endurance. The two weekly cross training workouts are individualized and may include swimming, cycling, rowing, or other workouts. A half marathon walking plan may include three short walks and one endurance walk per week, alongside one cross training session and two days of rest."
"
Start walking every day.Regardless of whether you want to walk or run the half marathon, it is best to start by simply walking every day.,
Increase the lengths of your walk every week.For week 1, walk five minutes per day.,
Monitor your symptoms and pulse.It is important to be mindful of your body and heart throughout the process of getting active.",How to Train for a Half Marathon After a Heart Attack2," Choose a nice route close to your home and avoid walking in extreme temperatures.If it is very hot or cold, you could try walking in an indoor shopping center.

, In week 2, you can increase your daily walk to ten minutes. Increase your daily walks by five minutes for each subsequent week until you get to thirty minute walks in week 6.


After you get to the point of walking continuously for thirty minutes per day for a couple weeks, you could talk to your doctor about starting a half marathon training plan.

, This should include taking your pulse and taking note of any discomfort in your chest. If you begin to feel discomfort in your chest, you should stop exercising and see a doctor.

You might consider asking the following questions:


Do you think I am in good enough shape yet to start training for a half marathon?
When do you think I could start training for a half marathon?

, If you are getting back into racing after a heart attack, it is best to start with a five kilometer event. After the five kilometer race, give your body plenty of time to rest and then start training for the half marathon., When training for a half marathon after a heart attack, you will want to adapt an existing walking program to allow for a more gradual increase of miles.Commonly available walking training programs last sixteen weeks, so try doubling the length of the training period to thirty two weeks. Add one week after each of the existing weeks in the program. In each of the added weeks, repeat the regular training walks from the prior week. When it is time for the long walk, make it the average of the length of the previous and coming weeks' long walk distances. In this manner, you will be cutting the weekly long walk mileage increases in half


If you are walking, your first week of training might involve two walks of thirty-five minutes, a thirty-minute walk, and an endurance walk of three miles. It will also involve two days of rest and one day of cross training., If you have recently experienced a heart attack, you will want to adapt an existing running program to meet your needs. If you find a typical sixteen week running program, try doubling the length of the training period to thirty-two weeks. Add an extra week after each of the existing weeks in the program, for a total of thirty-two weeks. In the new weeks, repeat the regular training runs from the prior week and design the weekly long run to be the average distance of the previous and coming weeks' long runs.


If you use the three plus two training program, the first week will involve track repeats, a short tempo run, and a long run of 12.5 kilometers or 8 miles. In addition, you will have two cross training workouts., Once you have started with your training program, you should avoid skipping any weeks in the program. If you happen to miss a day in the program, try to make it up that week. It is important to stay on track with the program, so that you gradually build up your fitness level and are ready to compete at the half marathon event.


If you are not feeling up to it, you can skip a weekly run or walk and talk to your doctor. If you miss too many training days, you may want to consider dropping out of the race. You can always keep up your running or walking routine and sign up for an event that gives you more time to prepare.

, Throughout your training program, you should be mindful of your heart. If you are feeling any pain in your chest or shortness of breath, you should stop exercising and see a doctor. If you are feeling faint or excessively fatigued after a training run or walk, you should talk to your doctor and reassess your fitness program., It is important to fuel your workouts with a healthy diet.A healthy diet of thirty percent healthy fat, thirty percent protein, and forty percent complex carbohydrates may work for you. Also, avoid binging and junk food while training., After completing your training program, which may last between fourteen and sixteen weeks, you can go ahead and race the event. Try to run in an event that has medical and emergency staff on hand. Relax, stay hydrated and enjoy yourself.

, It is important to schedule a recovery period after running or walking the half marathon. Your body will need time to repair itself and fully recover after the event, so you may want to take a break from exercise for a short period of time. The amount of recovery time you need should be determined in close consultation with your doctor."

Do long runs for training on weekends.,
Continue to run slower than your usual clocked marathon pace.,
Training on hills, whether the hill is steep or just a bit of an incline, adds leg-muscle strength.,
Know that hill training is very demanding at first because you are using muscles that you rarely use when just straight running.,
Understand that marathon training should balance three kinds of speed work as well as long distance running, being well hydrated and resting.",How to Prepare for a Marathon (Advanced)," Build up to between 10 and 20 miles (16 and 32 km), done three times a week. This contrasts with the early stages for a beginner marathon training. At this stage it is important to concentrate on quality runs. Try to be consistent in your runs, maintaining the same speed from start to the finish line. Resting in between is equally important in training at this level.;
, Consistent training at a relatively slow pace, results in becoming faster when running at the marathons.

, It also improves the cardiovascular system and helps improve your stride as well as expanding the length of your stride. Hill running makes you a better runner., Just like anything else, the more you train the easier it becomes. Make sure you stretch prior to running, drink a lot of water, so that you can develop strength and endurance., No matter what level runner you are, your success will be determined by the time and effort you put into training.

Don't hurt yourself seeking that high.",How to Get a Runner's High," Runner's high is your body's response to prolonged stress, so challenge it! Don't slack off or quit when you feel tired. Of course, ""pushing yourself"" may mean different things to different people, so interpret this according to your own level of fitness and experience. This could mean anything from:Completing a 20-minute run.
Running 90 minutes straight.
Increasing your pace from a 10-minute mile to a 9:30 mile.
Adding reps to interval training.
Matching your last interval's time with your first's.;
, As your running improves over time, expect your body to adapt to challenges already met. Since this lowers the chance of runner's high, keep switching things up from day to day. Even if you only have, say, 40 minutes to devote to running each day, find new ways to make each run different from the last. For example:Alternate between easy runs and hard runs.
Run different routes with different terrain.
Switch between distance runs and high-intensity workouts.
Challenge yourself by running faster paces.

, Keep your body energized with the right foods. Avoid tiring yourself out due to a lack of fuel before your body even has a chance to push itself for very long.Boost your energy levels with roughly 200 calories before working out. Depending on climate, drink between 8 and 16 ounces of water roughly 20 minutes after eating to hydrate yourself without impeding digestion.Give yourself at least 45 minutes to digest in between eating and running to avoid cramps.

, Keep in mind that getting runner's high is like catching lightning in a bottle. A lot of factors have to fall into place for it to happen, which are hard to predict or replicate, so don't make runner's high your main objective. Instead, focus on meeting performance goals. Increase your chance of feeling the high by constantly raising the bar for yourself.Pushing yourself too hard can lead to early fatigue and injury, so set realistic goals for yourself. Wiping yourself out too soon or hurting yourself will prevent you from running hard enough to achieve runner's high.
Runner's high occurs at different times for different people. Don't think you're doing something wrong just because a running partner experiences it and you don't when you run the same workout.
What works one day may not work the next, or ever again for that matter. Keep your runs varied in nature, rather than doing the same thing day after day in an attempt to repeat a high.

, If you're new to running, expect to achieve runner's high during basic distance runs far more frequently than more experienced runners will. However, don't expect it to happen right away. Concentrate on building your endurance through base training at first. This way you will be able to run for longer distances at more challenging paces, when runner's high is more likely to happen.Pushing yourself too hard too soon can result in injury or tiring yourself out too quickly for runner's high to occur.
""Base training"" simply refers to running at a consistent pace for longer and longer periods.

, First, consult a doctor beforehand if you're new to this. Discuss any concerns they may have regarding your personal condition. Once they sign off on the idea, ease into it by setting achievable goals. If needed, alternate between running and walking at first, rather than push yourself beyond your means and risk injury. Allow your body to adapt and develop. Then, once you meet your goals, set new ones, one baby step at a time, week by week. For instance:Start by running for one minute and walking for four, for a total of 30 minutes. When you feel ready, increase the running to two minutes and decrease the walking to three. Continue in this fashion until you can comfortably for 30 minutes straight.
Runner's high could occur as early as ten minutes into a consistent run for some people. For others, it may take much longer. Either way, set new goals each week. Just because runner's high might have occurred at the 15-minute mark one day last week doesn't mean that will happen again this week.

, Worry less about speed in the beginning of your training. Focus more on running a consistent pace from start to finish. Stick to a pace that allows you to talk comfortably. If you are unable to communicate simple sentences without gasping for air, slow down a little. Repeat as needed.Run with others so you can test your ability to talk.
Taking it easy as a beginner is essential to avoiding injury., Aim to run most days of the week. Maintain a consistent schedule, with at least one day off per week for rest. If needed, adjust your goals to ensure that you don’t overtax yourself and end up sidelined. Prioritize the number of workouts per week over the mileage. For example:If your current goal is to run 20 miles each week, divide them between four 5-mile runs or five 4-mile runs, rather than two 10-mile ones.
If your goal is based on time (say, 120 minutes) do the same. Run four 30-minute runs or five 24-minute runs instead of two hour-long runs.
Your body needs to feel stressed for runner's high to occur, so too much rest in between runs will decrease its chances.

, Once you grow accustomed to running comfortably without stopping for a half-hour, designate such runs as your easy days. Adjust your weekly schedule to accommodate an easy run one day, a hard run the next, an easy one the day after, and so on. Allow your body to recuperate in between hard runs without sacrificing a day of running.Gradually increase your goals on hard days to encourage runner's high. Say your easy run is four miles. On your hard days, run five.Or run four at a faster pace.
Continue adding more time or mileage to your hard days with each passing week, with the aim of being able to run anywhere between 90 and 150 minutes straight.
Runner's high could occur before this goal. However, as your body adapts to running for longer distances, it becomes less likely as your body adapts. To continue experiencing runner's high on basic distance runs, keep increasing the mileage and/or pace on hard days.

, Once you are running comfortably for prolonged periods, continue using at least one hard run per week to increase your mileage and endurance. At the same time, start designating at least one other hard day to challenge your body in new ways each week. Encourage runner's high by taxing your body with less familiar forms of stress.Runner’s high usually occurs when the body experiences prolonged stress. The more endurance you build, the less likely this will happen from basic distance runs, because your body's used to it
Seguing from base training to a variety of high-intensity workouts will keep your body from falling into a steady low-challenge routine.
Focus on endurance training for at least one month before incorporating high-intensity workouts into your schedule.,""These involve alternating between jogging and running at a much faster pace within one run. Start small by alternating between sprinting and jogging every two minutes. From there, try different combinations. Remember: the key to runner's high is placing new stresses on your body, so running different fartleks each time is a great way to increase your chances.For example:


On your next fartlek, you can increase both the jogging and sprinting intervals by equal amounts throughout one run. Jog for two minutes, sprint for two minutes, then jog for three and sprint three, followed by four jogging, then four sprinting, and so on.
The next time, you can increase the sprinting interval and keep the jogging the same. Jog for two minutes, sprint for two. Jog for another two, then sprint for three. Jog for two, sprint for four, and etc.
Then you can push your body further by running a faster pace for your ""jogging"" interval on your next fartlek.

, As always, to achieve runner's high, avoid routine and doing the exact same thing each week. Keep challenging your body with the unfamiliar by trying various combinations of:Short distances (400m, 300m, 200m, 100m)
Long distances (3200m, 1600m, 800m)
Same distances (such as ten reps of one 400m per rep)
Varied distances (like four reps with each rep including a 400m, a 300m, and a 200m, with a 100m walk or jog between each one)

, If possible, seek out two hills of different steepness for more variety.Run sets of one- to- two minute repeats up very steep hills (rising at 45-degree angle or higher).
Do sets of two- to four-minute repeats up gradual hills (rising at roughly 25-degree angles).
If possible, use different hills each time. Different types of terrain (sandy, grassy, rocky) provide unique challenges.

, As you improve, resist the urge to up your performance on your easy days. Better your odds at achieving runner's high on your next hard day (whether it’s a race or a workout) by making sure your body has recuperated from the last one. Remember to run at a pace that is slow enough for you to chat with a partner at the same time.Tiring yourself out by running hard on your easy day will set you back on your next hard day. Starting a hard run when you’re already exhausted will reduce the chance of pushing yourself hard enough for your brain to release the necessary chemicals.
At the same time, you're just as likely to experience runner's high on an easy day if your body still feels wiped out from yesterday's hard run.

, Once you successfully run 90 to 150 minutes a few times, start setting lower goals for your long-distance hard runs. Devote more time to high-intensity workouts, rather than accumulating more mileage per week. At the same time, reduce the chance of injury that may occur from so much repeated high-impact on your feet, legs, and hips.Don't worry about losing endurance. High-intensity workouts will still help build endurance despite the lower mileage.
At the same time, limiting the number of long-distance runs you go on will improve the odds of you experiencing runner's high the next time you go for one.

, Don’t expect runner's high to mask every single discomfort that you might feel. Take care of yourself so you can enjoy it more fully when it does occur. Always be sure to:Warm up for 15 to 20 minutes by jogging lightly or walking fast before your run, race, or workout.
Eat properly and stay hydrated, with enough time to digest food beforehand in order to avoid cramps.
Wear appropriate clothing and shoes, both for running in general and the weather.

, Remember: there is no guaranteed way to achieve runner's high. Resist the urge to push yourself harder than your body can handle when chasing it. Avoid over-straining or injuring yourself, since these will only hinder your chances.

If you're considering running a marathon, you should already be able to run for at least 30 minutes without stopping. Your schedule should include what types of training exercises you want to do, how many miles you want to do in a single run, and recovery exercises.Give yourself plenty of time to accomplish your goals. Don't expect instant results, especially when it comes to endurance training. You should set aside at least 16 to 20 weeks to train for a marathon.;
, Schedule running one long run a week and make sure you actually do it. When you start training, your long run should be about 10 to 11 miles. Every week, try to schedule extra miles. By the sixteenth or seventeenth week of training, you should be able to run about 22 miles for the long run. Long runs are important for preparing your musculoskeletal system for the actual marathon.Try to run at a pretty slow pace during your long run. You should be able to comfortably hold a conversation when you run.

, Short runs (around 3 or 4 miles) can improve your cardiovascular function. Medium runs (starting around 7 or 8 miles) should be a little faster paced than short runs. These runs help you build confidence that you can run for an extended time. Short and medium runs are good runs for the treadmill so you can control your pace. You shouldn't walk or be able to converse during a medium run.Aim to do 1 or 2 short runs and 1 medium run a week. Start out running about six miles per hour and add a tenth of mile per hour to your speed every minute after ten minutes. By about thirty minutes you should be going about eight miles per hour.

, Running too much can actually hurt your ability to perform in the marathon. You should spend some of your training days doing low-impact workouts that help you maintain your endurance and build upper body strength. If you don't currently cross train, start with just one day of low-impact exercising a week. Then, bump that up to 2 or 3 days of low-impact exercising a week alternating with running days. Consider doing the following activities:Yoga
Pilates
Weightlifting

, Treat your long runs as practice runs for the real marathon. If you have to miss a day or two of training, adjust your schedule so that you're only missing cross training or easy runs. When you do intense training runs, remember to have about a liter of water on hand and some gel nutrition packets. To avoid overdoing it, you can walk for part of a long run.Your longest pre-event run should be about one week before the event to allow your body plenty of recovery and fuel storage

, You should ice down your shins, knees and any sore parts of your legs after each run or whenever you feel muscle soreness. The ice will reduce any swelling or bruising in your legs that could lead to a severe injury later on. Apply an ice pack or immerse your legs in an ice bath for about 6 to 12 minutes. Take a warm shower about 30 minutes after using the ice.To make an ice bath, pour a few bags of ice into your bathtub or a container big enough to submerge your legs. Then add some cold water.

, If you workout every day, you’ll exhaust your body and damage your joints. You should take two days a week to relax and let yourself heal. Don’t do any type of strenuous exercise on your recovery days. Allowing your body to rest gives your muscles a chance to rebuild and get stronger after you break them down during your workouts.Try not to even think about your training on your recovery days. Your mind also needs time to recover so you don’t get burned out.

, Do stretches every day to decrease your chances of getting hurt. Stretch after runs and make sure to stretch muscles throughout your body, not just your legs. Avoid stretching before runs.Do static stretches only after runs by extending your arms or legs and holding the muscles so you feel the stretch. Hold them for 30 seconds and gently release. Avoid bouncing stretches that could pull or damage your muscles.While you run, your body will build up a lot of lactic acid that will cause your muscles to be extremely sore and could lead to injury. Stretching after your runs helps decrease the buildup of lactic acid in your body and fortifies it against injury.
Using a foam roller on your muscles can help to stretch them out effectively.

, You should never try to push yourself too hard if you feel that you may be risking injury. If at any time during your workout you feel that something isn’t right, you cramp up, or feel your legs go weak, stop immediately and take a break or walk. At the beginning of your training, your body may not be able to handle all the impact on your joints.Focus on increasing your stride speed, not your stride length.

, While you're training, 60 to 65% of your diet should come from mainly complex carbohydrates. Eat foods like potatoes, beans, yams, wheat bread, pasta and apples. While you're running, eat carbohydrate gels every 30 to 45 minutes. Carbohydrates help your body produce energy for running so they're an important part of a marathon runner's diet.Your normal diet should consist of about two thousand to two thousand five hundred calories. During training, you should add an extra one hundred calories for each mile you run.
Monitor your body weight to ensure that you are getting adequate nutrition.
Most runners add 100 calories for every mile that they run. For example, if you run 11 miles, then you would need to add 1,100 calories.

, While you’re training, 15 to 20 percent of your calories should come from protein. Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.6 to determine how many grams of protein you need. Include chicken, eggs, fish, peanut butter, legumes, dairy, and lean beef in your diet. You can also get a protein supplement from a health food store if you have trouble meeting your daily requirements from your diet alone.Your body needs protein to repair your muscles after they tear during your workout. Make sure your body gets enough protein to rebuild your muscles every time you break them down.

, Perhaps the most important part of preparing for a marathon is making sure your body can withstand the intense punishment it can inflict on your bones. Make sure you're eating lots of calcium-rich foods like broccoli, collard greens, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and salmon.You can also take a calcium supplement if you're prone to fractures. Take 2000 mg of calcium a day.

, While you're training, stay properly hydrated. Drink at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of water. While you're running (a long run or the marathon), plan to drink 8 ounces of fluid every twenty minutes that you run. Avoid drinking too much water or you could get hyponatremia. Excess water could dilute your blood causing your cells to swell.A good way to judge if you’re hydrated is by testing the color of your urine. It should be bright yellow to clear in color. If it’s dark or cloudy, you should drink more water.

, Buy your shoes from a store that specializes in running footwear. A professional shoe store will measure the width and the arch of your foot and guide you to the shoe that best suits you. Wearing normal tennis shoes during long runs could injure your foot. Wear shoes you've trained in several times when you actually run the marathon. You don't want to break in new shoes while running a challenging race.Try not to wear high heels too often while you’re training for a marathon. High heels put extra strain on your legs and can lead to injury.

, While you’re at the running store, pick up a pair of double layered socks. Double layered socks will prevent your heels and toes from getting blistered during the marathon. Normal socks don’t offer enough protection and can leave your feet blistered and in pain. The discomfort could be so bad that it causes you to cut your workout short.


Compression socks are often used by marathon runners to reduce muscle soreness, but more research is needed., You want your heart rate to be fifty to eighty-five percent of your maximum heart rate to get the most out of your work out. Your ideal maximum heart rate should be about two hundred and twenty minus your age. For example, if you’re twenty, your maximum heart rate should be about two hundred beats per minute. While you workout, it should be from one hundred to one hundred and seventy beats per minute.Give yourself time to get your heart rate into a proper zone if you’re not used to intense running.
If your rate gets to over ninety percent of your maximum heart rate, take a break and cool down for a bit.

, The actual marathon will have tables set up at points in the race where you can grab cups of water. But, you’ll need a way to hydrate yourself during your training runs. Use a running belt to carry a few bottles of water with you while you run. The belt should be snug but not too restricting. Or, you can stagger bottles of water along your training path if you don't want to run with water.Remember that if you choose to wear a belt in your training, you’ll feel lighter at the actual marathon. Account for the change in weight and try to run the marathon at the same pace that you practiced running.

Find a runner’s group.",How to Prepare For a Long Distance Run1," If you aren’t doing cross-country as a school or college sport, you have the freedom to decide exactly how long you want your long-distance run to be. Long distance runs span a range from a 3K (three kilometers, or under 2 miles) all the way up to a marathon (over 40 kilometers, or 26 miles) or an ultra-marathon (over 60 kilometers).Think about your previous athletic experience and how hard you want to push yourself.


If you're amping up from a sedentary lifestyle, talk to a doctor before starting a new exercise regimen. You can work together to develop a plan that takes your strengths and weaknesses into account.You will want to consider your body’s limitations, including asthma or injuries, in your decision.
Also take the availability of safe places to run near you into account.;
, You probably don’t want to wait, but it’s important to give your body time to adjust to long-distance running. Depending on your fitness level, it takes a new runner about 3 to 6 months to prepare for a half marathon and about 6 to 12 months to prepare for a marathon.You’re going to be building up to the race, so there’s no need to strain yourself right off the bat.


If you’re running a very long race, like a half or full marathon, make use of a professionally developed training plan. There are plenty available on the Internet, or you can reach out to a local running or athletic store for resources.There's no need to run every day. It's actually best not to. Shoot for three or four days a week, with one of those days perhaps being an extra-long weekend run.
Be aware that you won’t necessarily run the full distance before the race. The only time marathon runners actually run marathons is on race day!, This is counterintuitive but essential. You can’t sustain a sprint for ten miles, so don’t try. Pace yourself--you can always build up speed later in your training. The most important thing right now is learning to cover a lot of ground., The number of steps you take per minute is called your cadence. Professional runners actually run with shorter steps than an average person--they just make those steps faster. Maintaining a shorter stride will also help protect you from strain and injury.A cadence of 180 is ideal. To figure out what it’s like to perform this way, run on a treadmill and watch a clock with a second hand. Time your steps so that you’re taking three steps every second., Running at exactly the same pace for ten miles can get a little monotonous. Once you’ve started to feel comfortable running long distance, mark off set periods of speedwork: increase your pace to a near-sprint for a half-mile, then recover for a mile at your normal jogging pace., If you’re comfortable running for a long time, and you’ve gotten the hang of speedwork, you can start to familiarize yourself with the fast finish. Ramp up the pace for the last few miles of your run to train your body to power through the last bits of a long race.Do not do a fast finish every time you go for a run. Save it for special occasions! It’s best once a week at most.

, If you want to get feedback, motivation, and potential new friends, locate a runner’s group near you. They’re all over the place and they exist for all different levels and events. Try Googling your area’s running groups, or ask for a referral at a running supply store.Running groups can help you by getting you motivated to leave the house. If you have a scheduled time to run, it’s easier to honor it.
Another advantage of a running group is that it keeps you from getting bored while you run, if you’re social. Furthermore, a little friendly competition before the race never hurt anyone.

Stretch.,
Take walk breaks if you need them.,
Stay hydrated.,
Carb up.,
Embrace good habits.",How to Prepare For a Long Distance Run2," You don’t need to twist yourself up like a pretzel, but a few gentle stretches can go a long way toward protecting you from injury. Make sure you stretch your arms as well as your legs, because it is possible to get a shoulder cramp. Stretch before and after every run, and after you wake up for bonus points. Be sure that you are warmed up before you stretch. It is important for your muscles to be warm when you stretch.


To stretch your hamstrings, do the figure-4. Sit on the ground with one leg extended in front of you, and the other bent so that its knee touches the floor and its foot touches the other leg’s knee. Reach toward your extended foot, and hold.To stretch your quads, stand on one leg and grab the ankle of your other leg. Gently pull it back. If you have trouble balancing here, tighten your abs.
To stretch your shoulders, move one arm so that your hand is between your shoulder blades and your elbow is pointing up. Grab the elbow with your opposite hand and pull carefully., It’s good to keep a consistent pace, but stopping your running to walk every now and then is actually good for your muscles and breath. Plus, if you’re doing a long run or race, you’ll need to stop running to rehydrate anyway. , This doesn't only help you run longer without losing your breath, but it also helps reduce the chance of getting cramps. 8 glasses (64 ounces, or about 2 liters) a day is the gold standard, but everybody is different—experiment until you find an amount of water that feels right for your body without weighing it down.It's possible to overdo it with hydration; excess water might make you feel bloated or weighted down. Listen to your thirst cues, and don't keep chugging water if you feel like there's no room in your stomach for it., A couple hours before you run, fuel yourself correctly! Carbohydrates are the preferred fuel for long-distance runners, and the right ones burn slowly and consistently to give you plenty of energy. You can throw a little fat into your pre-running meal as well (like olive oil or peanut butter), but save heavy-protein foods like steak or tofu for later.


The best carbohydrates are the so-called “complex” ones, which give you excellent energy without a crash. Focus on whole grains like whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice; root vegetables like sweet potatoes; and pulses like beans, peas, and lentils.Avoid simple carbohydrates, like heavily sugared cereals and doughnuts.

, A long-distance run asks a lot of your body. Therefore, you'll want to treat your body right, so it performs for you. This means emphasizing the things you already do to keep it in good shape, and eliminating any habits that might be holding you back.


Do not smoke! It shortens your breath and constricts your blood vessels.Drink in moderation (if at all). Alcohol dehydrates you, and too much of it can keep your body from absorbing protein from food.This means you'll have to work even harder to build muscle.
Get some sleep. Sleep helps your body refresh and regenerate, and sharpens your mind, too.Everybody is different—shoot for 8 hours of sleep, and adjust if that feels like too much or too little.

Don’t push too hard before the race.,
Eat extra carbs.,
Wake up and move around.,
Eat a good breakfast.,
Hydrate to dominate.,
Warm up and psych down.,
Do your best.",How to Prepare For a Long Distance Run3," You may want to double-check that you can finish a run as long as the event that you’ve prepped for. Resist the urge! It’s important to go easy on yourself so you’ve got the maximum amount of energy for the run.If you feel like you’re going to go wild without some physical activity, you can always do yoga, stretch, or dance.
Remember to sleep, too.

, If you live in a town that annually holds a big race, you might have noticed that the night before, the town often holds a giant pasta dinner in town hall or a public park. The carbohydrate consuming that you did during your training should reach a frenzy right before the race. Lean into it--food is fuel, and pasta is delicious.


If you have a running group or squad, have a pasta potluck and wish each other luck the night before.

, Start off on the day of the big race by waking up with extra time. Do a few dynamic stretches or jumping jacks, or anything to get your blood pumping, Make sure you don't push yourself too hard, though. Save your energy for the race., Fiber and hydration are important now more than ever. If you’re not usually a breakfast person, it’s still important to eat something. A healthy breakfast of complex carbohydrates and a little protein and fat, paired with a big glass of water, can really help you run faster.


Some great breakfast ideas include oatmeal with peanut butter; a banana with a handful of nuts; and toast, dates, and protein spread.Avoid sugary foods such as donuts or muffins for breakfast, as they won't give you any energy or stamina for your run.

, A big glass of water (around 16 ounces) is a good idea in the hour leading up to the race; dehydration is real, and drinking a moderate amount of water will help you avoid it.Plan to supplement this with water stops along the route, but don't overdo it. If you drink too much water during the race, it'll end up slowing you down.Check if there will be hydration stations available during the race. If not, you can run with a small water bottle.

, There's a performance aspect to running a race, and it's possible to get a little nervous in the hours leading up to it. This is one case in which you don't want to meditate or nap if you're anxious. After all, if you get too relaxed, you won't run as well. So shoot for a physically and mentally calm, but alert, state.


Deep breathing and gentle stretching can help prepare both your body and mind.
Try tensing your already-tense muscles, then relaxing them.It may seem simple, but smiling helps transform your outlook and relax your body. Try it!, You’ve been training for weeks or months, and you’re all ready to begin your long-distance run. No matter what happens, be proud of yourself! You set a goal and sweated a lot as you worked toward it. Hopefully, your first race is so fun that you decide to stick with long-distance running.

Determine the days in which you can dedicate time during the next three to four months for training.,
Do one long run per week.,
There are many good web sites which contain marathon training charts.,
Now, here is the key to raising your training to the next level: Practice your race pace the day before conducting your long run.,
During your long run the following day, you may find your legs slightly fatigued.,
During your last week of hard training, you should run around 10–12 miles (16–19 km) at marathon pace, followed the next day by a 20–24 mile (32–39 km) run.,
What do I mean by marathon pace and how do you calculate it?,
Make sure to mix in speed work and hill training each week.,
The final part of any good marathon training program is the taper.",How to Improve Your Marathon Finish Time," Many runners gear up and meet friends after work to go for a run. The important thing is to establish a routine to which you can commit.;
, A typical marathon training program begins with a 10 mile (16 km) run and builds to 20–24 miles (32–39 km). The long runs are the most important part of any marathon training program.

, Find one that fits your ability level. Here are two good sites: www.marathontraining.com/marathon/m_sch_1.html , www.halhigdon.com/marathon/Mar00intermediate.htm .

, Run half the distance of your long run scheduled for the next day; this will get you accustomed to running at this pace.

, Pushing through this fatigue will train your body and mind to fight through fatigue and pain during a marathon. Conduct this run anywhere between 45 to 90 seconds per mile slower than your marathon pace.

, You are now ready for your fastest marathon.

, Your marathon pace is the speed at you plan on running the marathon for which you are training. Divide your desired finish time by 26.2. For example, if you want to run a 4 hour marathon, your pace will be 6.55 mph (10.54 km/h) or 9:09 minutes per mile.

, Hill work will strengthen your legs, and speed work will train your body to transfer oxygen into your blood faster. Both will mentally prepare you for the discomforts of running a marathon.

, Reduce your weekly and long run mileage two weeks prior to your marathon. During these final two weeks, long workouts cannot benefit or further prepare your body. You must now let your body rest and heal.

, Don't think about running while you're running. Most likely you will tire out easier when you are thinking about the same thing you are doing. Especially if you're thinking about when you can stop or how long until your run is over.

, Most people nowadays in this generation are plugged into their iPods when they do exercise, and that's great! One of the most popular music player for the on-the-go lifestyle is the iPod shuffle. Listening to your 'tunes' while working out should make time fly! You can also sort songs in your playlist so that your favorite song is at the end, that way you keep working until the very end to get your treat of hearing your favorite song.

, Don't start out your jog too fast, or you'll get tired faster. Pace yourself at a comfortable jog that is slightly tougher than what you usually jog, and when you're near the very end, release the turbo in your legs! Also, if you feel the need to rest, do so!

, Try setting goals for how long you run each day. The first time: run for 10 minutes, second time: 20 minutes, third: 30, and so on. You should not spend your whole day jogging. You will probably get bored and tired.

, You should wear running shoes that you like and that are comfortable for running. There are also some shoes out there that can have a sensor where it synchronizes to your iPod and gives you your running progress.

Stretch before you run.,
Give yourself a chance to warm up.,
Practice consistently.,
Use interval training to build speed and endurance.,
Invite friends to run with you.",How to Get Faster at Running1," Stretching is an important part of almost any exercise routine. Running is no exception. When you stretch, you're warming up the muscles in your body and getting them pumped up for the hard work that you're about to do.


One good stretch is called ""the Stork."" Stand up straight. Bring one foot up behind you toward your bottom. Gently grab it with one hand (you can support yourself against a wall with your other hand if necessary). Put light tension on your leg until you feel a stretch in your quadriceps (the front of your thigh). Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat with the other leg.;
, Before you run, speed up your heartbeat and get your blood pumping by taking a two minute jog. You'll get a slight boost of energy and it will be easier to focus on running quickly. As long as your warmup isn't too intense, you won't be too tired to give your run your best effort.

, For most runners, going on a run every day or every other day is best. The key here is consistency. To see long-term results, you need to stick to your exercise schedule and slowly ramp up the difficulty over time. If you quit or fail to challenge yourself, your performance may plateau or even decrease.

, Take 10 minutes each day for an interval run. As you run, follow this pattern: sprint for 10 seconds, then rest by jogging for a minute. Repeat for 10 minutes.


To challenge yourself, every week add a few seconds to your sprinting time and shorten your breaks. Over time, you will be able to run faster and longer.

, Try competing with a friend slightly faster than yourself. It will give you the motivation of winning, and it will be much more challenging then running by yourself or with someone slower then you. Don't run with someone much faster than you, or you might consider giving up.

Decide where to run.,
Jog one or two laps around the track.,
Do dynamic stretches.,
Determine your desired sprint time/length.,
Do your first sprint at about 70% intensity, then increase.,
Rest 2-5 minutes in between sprints.,
Keep your first session short.,
Cool down.,
Perform your new sprinting routine 2 or 3 times a week.",How to Do Sprint Training1," Running on a track is the most popular place for sprint training because the distances are demarcated by lines on the ground, making it easy to keep track of exactly how far you’re running. The surface is also good for shock absorption, which is helpful for keeping your joints healthy and free of injury.


If you don’t live near a school, gym, or other place with a track, you can still run sprints on any number of flat areas. Consider running on soccer field, football field, or other long stretch of grass or turf that is relatively flat.
Depending on length and patterns of usage, you might also be able to find a parking lot or other paved area nearby that is relatively flat and would work well for sprinting. Look for an area at least 40 meters long. While pavement is not ideal for running, lots of people run marathons on the road, so a handful of sprints is surely a better option!;
, This will get your body warmed up and ready for more intense work.If you’re working out somewhere other than a track, try jogging for 2–4 minutes as a warm-up.

, Doing a limited number of dynamic stretches before sprinting has been shown to improve sprint times and help the body avoid injury. Dynamic stretches are stretches performed while walking.


Too much of this type of intense stretching will cause fatigue and decrease your sprinting performance, so aim to spend about 10 minutes if you’re in average shape, and up to 20 minutes if you’re super fit. Dynamic stretching requires more effort and is therefore more tiresome than the gentle stretches most people are familiar with. You don’t want to put in twenty minutes and expend all your energy—then you won’t have any left for sprinting!
Try these different stretches: Gluteals – Walking High Knees; Hamstrings – “Toy Soldiers” or “Frankensteins”; Adductors – Hurdler’s Walk; Quadriceps – “Butt-Kickers”; and Gastrocnemius – Tip-Toe Walking., Thirty seconds is a good starting time, so long as you have a stopwatch or other device that can alert you when the time is up. Once you improve your stamina and speed, you can increase to longer time periods.


If you don’t have an appropriate timing device, trying sprinting for about 200m. If you’re not sprinting on a track and have no way of measuring the distance exactly, try counting your steps, aiming for between 120 and 130. This won’t give you exactly 200m/30 seconds, but it will put you reasonably close., Don’t exert yourself to the full level of your capability right off the bat. Doing so can lead to injury, especially if you’re not using proper form or your muscles aren’t sufficiently warmed up.For your second sprint, increase to 80% intensity; after this, if you’re not experiencing joint or muscle pain (which are signs that you need to back off), you can increase to total or near-total intensity for the remainder for the session. Pain while sprinting could signal that you need more warm-up time or that you’re not using proper form.

, You need rest between sprints so that your body can recover and you can sprint at the same speed multiple times. You should rest 3 seconds for every 1 second that you sprinted. So, for example, if you sprinted for 30 seconds, you should rest for 90 seconds; if you sprinted for 60 seconds, rest for 3 minutes.Walking should be your form of “rest,” not sitting or standing. This will keep your muscles from cramping. Walk back to the place where you began your sprint, and you’ll be ready to start again.Sprinting is an intense exercise that will use up all of the oxygen in your muscles. You need adequate rest time between each sprint to maximize your speed and allow the oxygen to get back to your muscles. Otherwise you may feel nauseous and/or lightheaded.

, Four sprints is plenty for your first sprinting session. This may not seem like a lot, but when this kind of intense work is new to your body, starting with too much too soon is a sure recipe for injury.After a few sessions you can gradually increase the number of sprints, eventually moving up to 8 or 9, depending on your individual fitness level and goals.

, Walk or slowly jog around the track for about 5 minutes to allow your heart rate to settle and help prevent cramping due to a build-up of lactic acid in your muscles., Because this is such a high-impact, high-intensity workout, it should be limited to a few times a week and you should allow at least 48 hours in between.While this might not seem like a lot, soon you will begin to see improvements in your running times as well as your breathing rates.Beyond that, the shape and tone of your body will quickly begin to improve as well!

Use good running form.,
Use a sustainable breathing pattern.,
Give yourself a time goal.,
Keep your eyes on the prize (literally).,
Hydrate!",How to Get Faster at Running2," Adopt a proper running posture, keeping your back straight and swaying your arms held in a 90 degree angle at the elbow. Run on the balls of your feet, using them to spring off with every step.


Try pushing your legs further back to give yourself a longer stride. You will get a better grip of the ground and allow yourself to bounce off the ground, and it gives you an extra boost in every step. If you ever watch Olympic sprinters, you'll notice that they almost always have very long strides.
Your upper body is important too. Put a bend in your arms and pump them up and down sharply with each step. Leave your palms open, with fingers together as if you were stabbing the air. This should help you force yourself forward more easily.

, While you run, you want to be taking in enough oxygen that you can maintain a light conversation. If you can't, you're likely to run out of steam and you'll have to slow down. Deep, steady breathing will help you run more quickly in the long term.


Some people breathe in through their noses for three seconds and exhale for two. See what you're comfortable with — one person's breathing style may not be best for everyone.

, Use a stopwatch to time yourself every running session. Each time, try to go just a little bit faster on the same route. The added incentive will help you push yourself to the max.


Just before you reach your goal, even if it seems impossible, try to force as much power out of your body as you can and put out a burst of speed. You may be surprised by how fast you can actually go when you know you're about to reach your goal. This can improve your time drastically.

, Even something as simple as changing the way you look ahead can make you a better runner. Try to focus your eyes on where you want to go, rather than on the area right in front of your feet. Keep focusing on new spots further down the path as you move — you won't ever feel like you're almost done, so you won't give up as easily.


For example, if you're running on a straight track and you're coming to the end, try focusing on a spot far ahead of the finish line and push yourself to run there. This can help keep your motivation high until it's actually time to quit.

, If you're not meeting your biological needs, you'll have a harder time running as fast as you can. Taking a small drink of water before your run ensures your muscles have the water they need when it counts. It's also a good idea to carry a little water with you so you can take drinks as needed during your run.


There is such a thing as too much water, however. Don't drink a ton of water right before running. Drink small amounts as you go, but try not to take big gulps. This will give you cramps.

Find a good hill.,
Warm up by jogging.,
Do dynamic stretches on a flat area.,
Run your first sprint at between 50-70% intensity.,
Rest between sprints.,
Watch your form.,
Take it easy the first time out.,
Cool down on flat ground.,
Do 1-2 sessions a week.",How to Do Sprint Training2," A good running hill will be fairly steep and at least 40 yards long. Unless you know of such a place (and its length) off the top of your head, you’ll probably want to drive around in your car and check out some nearby places.If you don’t have a car, then take a walk around the area or ride the bus if one is available.
Depending on the hill you choose, you may need to consider traffic flow, availability of sidewalks or berms (if running on the road), lighting, foliage, and the general safety of the area that you will be running in. As with any athletic activity, it’s important to be aware of the conditions and plan your attire appropriately, including whether to running shoes or cross-trainers.

, Jog for 2–4 minutes on a flat area near the hill. If you really prefer it, however, you can do a light jog up and back down the hill to get your body ready for the sprinting workout.

, Even though you’ll be sprinting up the hill, you’ll want to do your stretching on flat ground so as not to over-tire yourself. Dynamic stretches are performed while walking, and you can help prevent injury if you do a limited number of these before beginning your sprinting workout.


Aim to spend about 5–10 minutes stretching before doing hill sprints. Some particularly good stretches for this type of workout are high knees, butt kicks, and toy soldiers. Stretch until you feel energized—not fatigued., You can increase with each sprint, but only by about 10%. If you’re new to sprinting, or not in great shape, you may want to wait until the third or fourth session to go all-out on any of your sprints., Walking down the hill will give your body time to recuperate between sprints.If you still feel too fatigued after getting to the bottom of the hill, walk on flat ground for another 15–30 seconds before beginning the next sprint.

, Steeper hills require shorter strides and vice versa. It is important to pay attention to your running form so that you avoid injury.


Don’t stare at the ground! Hold your chin at the normal level and keep your eyes looking forward.You should keep your torso upright and the balls of your feet should land directly under your chest. Do not lean forward when running.Hills sprints have a great fitness pay-off but are very challenging—if you’re unable to maintain proper form, then you should stop to avoid injury and over-work.

, Hill sprints are more intense than sprinting on flat ground, so you shouldn’t push yourself too hard during your first session. Try running 4 or 5 sprints at 75% intensity.

, Spend 5–10 minutes lowering your heart rate and keeping cramps at bay by walking or lightly jogging on flat ground.

, Because it is such a high intensity workout, you should aim for about two sessions of hill sprints a week, allowing two to three days in between each session so that your muscles have time to recover.

Have a running event to prepare for is useful in sticking your run schedule and keeping up your motivation., Having one person or a group of people to run with at your level can help you keep motivated, especially when you're not looking forward to your run.


You won't want to disappoint your running partner or team by stopping or giving up, and this will give you the push you need to keep running.
A running club can be a great alternative if you have trouble committing to regular runs. Most clubs have groups for people at different levels and set times and places to meet. You can find something that suits what you're looking for., The American College of Sports Medicine has shown that the best indicator of a good shoe is fit, and not style, weight, or padding. At the end of the day what matters is how the shoe fits your foot.Don't run in the wrong shoes. You might not be able to wear the brand that works great for your friend. And if you're a beginner, don't plan to just use your old gym shoes or other shoes that you use for particular sports because you're not sure how often you'll run or whether you'll really commit to it. You need shoes that are appropriate to your foot, your alignment and to your running., After 300-500 miles, it's time to get a new pair. After that much running, mid-soles can become too compressed and won't return to their usual shape in between your runs.If you continue to run in the same shoes, you risk injury. Your feet, Achilles tendons, and shins are usually the first to feel the brunt of old and tired shoes, but the injury can increase and become more widespread the longer you wear shoes that are no longer supportive., Although running can technically cost you nothing as long as you have shoes, it may be worth splurging to get some new gear. Having some new things might help amp up your motivation! Get a new shirt, pair of workout pants, or fun headband or hat that you are excited to wear and try out., Plan when you are going to run and put it in your agenda or calendar for the week. This will keep you committed to your runs and ensure that they won't slip your mind.


Be sure as well to plan your route ahead of time. Use an online or print map of your area and plot out your route. This is useful for finding new and alternative routes and making adjustments for distance as well as planning for particular situations like heavy traffic, road closures or construction that may make your usual route., British researchers have found that music helps push you to reach the finish line - and your goal - faster. Create new playlists with your favorite high-energy tracks., Start each run with a light warm-up of around five minutes. Warming up helps to prevent injuries caused by sudden strain on your muscles. Keep in mind that static stretching, or stretching while you stand still, before a workout can diminish performance. Instead commit to doing active stretches where you move your limbs through a range of motion. Active stretching can enhance performance.Your warm-up can include jogging or marching on the spot, gentle jumps, side stepping, and climbing stairs, among other exercises., Start walking for an amount of time (anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes) that feels comfortable to you. Once you can walk for 30 minutes without losing your breath and while still feeling good, start including running intervals. These running intervals need only be 1-2 minutes and you don't need to go very fast at first. After the 1-2 minute run, return to walking at a comfortable pace.As you get stronger, adjust the running intervals to make them longer until you are running for a full 30 minutes without walking.

, Unsurprisingly, the best way to build endurance for greater distance running is to run further. But the problem is that people get highly motivated and run too far too soon into their training. Instead, you need to progress gradually.Increase your mileage by only about 10 percent per week. Do this for three weeks and then back off for a week by 20-25%. Repeat until you can run the distance you want., Do longer runs at a slower pace, a pace where you can hold a full conversation.These runs are useful because they rest your muscles while still helping you build stamina. Your rested muscles will help you pick up the pace on days when you have more intense runs.One of your runs each week should be longer and slower than your other runs., Most people start out too fast in their runs and then slow down as they get tired. Running feels a lot easier at first than it does part way through. Don't burn yourself out before you've even really begun.Start at an easy stride and then gradually increase your pace until you reach your desire speed., Consider your running techniques - do you hunch or pound the pavement on your heel? It can take a few weeks to correct bad habits and form but making these adjustments is worth it in the long run - you'll increase your agility and speed and decrease the risk of injuring yourself.Run with your arms, shoulders, and jaw relaxed. Have your elbows gently bent at your side.Keep an upright posture and maintain a tall spine. Imagine a thread pulling the top of your head up to the sky.Aim for a stride rate of 170-180 per minute. Focus on making sure your foot lands under your center gravity instead of out in front. Doing this encourages your foot to strike the ground with its middle rather than its heel.Landing on your heel slows you down and can increase injury risk since you're placing more weight on your joints., You should try to make it out for a run at least twice a week. It's important to be consistent; you'll see improvements in your running as your body adapts to the training.


It's better to run twice a week every week than to run a bunch of times in a single week and then take a few weeks off., A tempo run means running out of your comfort zone for some sections of our run. Once a week, run easy for about 10 minutes, then ramp up the pace (to about 80-84% effort) for the next 15 minutes.You can also shorten these intervals; incorporate three intervals of 5 minutes at tempo pace in a 30-minute run. Use the remaining intervals to recover at your normal pace.
Tempo runs helps strengthen your hear for distance running., The best way to get faster is to acclimatize your body to a faster pace. Higher intensity runs builds power and kickstarts the fast-twitch muscle fibers required for fast running.Speed work can be tough but you can also make it manageable. Go for your usual run at your normal pace. Pause and get your breath, then run fast (approximately 90% effort) for 80-100 meters. Then walk or jog lightly to recover. Do this anywhere between 3 and 5 times. Remember to keep your form and technique.Incorporate speed bursts into your runs once or twice a week to notice improvement in speed., Running on soft surfaces can require nearly double the effort of running on hard surfaces like pavement. This is a great way to get in an intense, short workout, particularly while travelling., Weights are a good supplement to training because they strengthen the muscles and joints. Weight training also decreases injury risk.Research shows that runners who lift weights at least three times a week are stronger runners - they can run for longer and faster.When lifting weights to augment your running, it's best to use a heavy weight that is enough to push your limits after 5 repetitions. Lifting lighter weights with high repetitions works to develop muscle size and endurance, but will not make you run faster. Fewer reps with heavier weight will help to develop faster, more powerful muscle contractions.Strengthen and stretch your hip flexors. Studies have shown that doing hip-strengthening exercises can improve speed and agility.Try some basic exercises like the clamshell or sidestep. Make sure you are doing hip exercises at least 2-3 times a week.Strengthen your hamstrings. It's important for runners to have strong and open hamstrings because fatigue in those muscles can cause injuries to your knees. Dead lifts, leg curls, and box jumps are good exercises to strengthen the back of your legs and avoid hurting your joints.Strengthen your buttocks. Have a strong gluteus medius can help prevent lower-body injuries. Try taking the stairs instead of elevators during your daily routines.Strengthen your core. The core is an area often forgotten by runners. To reduce inefficient motion while running, train and strengthen your core to provide stability. Static exercises like planks will give you the best core workout, rather than endless situps where its easy to fall into the bad habit of using momentum rather than strength., Cross-training involves doing another type of fitness activity that is not running. Cycling, swimming, skiing, using the elliptical machine are all ways to pump up your cardiovascular system without straining those muscles used in running. In fact, intense cross-training for an hour can elicit the same aerobic benefits as a run.It's important do cross-training that involves lower-impact activity than running, which is a high impact activity. This will provide some relief to your joints on non-running days. Good activities include swimming, cycling, and rowing, among others.There is a basic formula for cross-training: Do 60 minutes at or above 70 percent of your maximum heart rate. This will be the equivalent of a 8km run.
Incorporate cross-training into your workout a couple of times a week (on days when you don't run).

, After exercising, massage your leg muscles with a foam roller. This post-workout exercise will increase flexibility and range of motion in the knees. Rolling will also work to break down scar tissue., Fish oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help decrease inflammation, boost immunity and help protect against heart disease. Fish oil capsules can be purchased from most health food stores., Research has shown that women runners who avoid healthy fats is the top indicator of the risk of injury.In fact, consuming healthy fats can reduce your risk of running-related injuries, such as stress fractures.Snacks with healthy fat include walnuts, avocado and hard-boiled eggs.

, Research has shown that having caffeine is good for recovery. Ingesting caffeine along with carbohydrates after an intense run rebuilds glycogen stores 66 percent better than if you simply consumed carbohydrates alone.

, Another good recovery drink is chocolate milk because it has the right concoction of carbs, protein, and caffeine to help your muscles rebuild., For example, layer yogurt, berries, nuts and granola to make a parfait. While this looks like a fancy snack, it also gives your body the main nutrients key to better running: calcium, antioxidants, carbs, and protein., After an intense run, one of your next two meals should be a protein-heavy meal, which helps your muscles rebuild and repair. Add a salad of leafy greens to give your body added nutrients and minerals., Before a run, drink at least 8 ounces of water about 30 minutes before you leave. This will help prevent dehydration.


If you plan to run longer than 10 kilometres, consider bringing a water bottle with you. Staying hydrated during long runs will keep your legs from cramping and is also especially important when it is very hot out.Even if you're not a regular runner, be sure to drink 8-10 glasses of water throughout the day. This will replenish the fluid lost during exercise. Just make sure to spread your water out and don't drink it all at once."

",How to Do Gym Exercises (Beginner Sprinters)," 10 minutes of warming up, on either treadmill or bicycle.;
,, Do 3 sets of 8-10 reps (3x8-10). For legs. Excellent exercise. Video link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVujjfzphI


When squatting, focus on keeping the weight on your midfoot to heel. Keep your knees out and to the side, imagine pushing the ground away from you to your sides.
A lot of people make the mistake of half squatting. Half squatting is ineffective compared to the full squat. A squat is considered a full squat when the crease of your hip travels below your knee.
Start with no weight on the bar, to work on your technique.

, Simple exercise, but great for overall upper-body strength. Do 4x10 with variations, wide grip (elbows pointing out) and tricep pushup (arms in and elbows pointing towards your feet). Do them on your knees if you aren't strong enough yet.


Think about form and technique. It's easy to cheat on pushups.
If your gym has pushup handles, use them.

, A strong core is every athletes base of support. All the power you will generate stems from here. Situps are great, do 4x10. Do some planks for 10 sec, then 30, 45, and last 60 seconds:http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/abdominalcorestrength1/qt/plank.htm. If your gym has an ab- rolling wheel, use it, one of my own personal favourites and it blasts your core!

, For shoulders. Shoulders are key to running fast. They create a motion that adds to the forward momentum. Do 4x8. Remember to keep a slight bend in your elbows, to reduce the risk of elbow tendinitis.

If you're going to meditate, you should run in an area where there isn't much traffic, such as a running trail in a park.If you run in the evening, make sure the area where you plan to run is well-lit and not too isolated.
Make sure you're dressed appropriately for the activity, the location, and the weather. For example, if you're running on a wooded trail, you may want to wear long pants to protect your legs.;
, To meditate, you need something specific for your mind to focus on. You may have heard Buddhist chants, but your point of focus can be something more familiar to you, such as a happy mental image or motivational phrase.Many people choose to focus on their breath, the sound of their footsteps on the ground, or the feeling of the environment around them.
A more rhythmic point of focus, such as the sound of your feet, can work better for a running meditation. Focusing on your breath may put you out of sync with your running.
A mental image or symbol is a common point of focus, but be careful with visualization if you're running in an area where you have to be aware of passing traffic or other runners.

, When you're ready to start, go slow for 15 to 20 minutes to warm up your muscles and relax your mind. During this phase, let yourself think about anything that comes to mind. Give yourself time to get adjusted to your activity and your surroundings.You also can use this time to fully observe and become comfortable with your surroundings, particularly if you're running at a location with which you're not completely familiar.
Get used to the way the air feels and the ambient noise around you so you won't be easily distracted.
Start to relax your mind by decreasing your attachment to thoughts or feelings as they come up. If a problem or area of concern comes up, note it and move on rather than trying to solve it or allowing yourself to get distressed by it.

, When you're warmed up and ready to start your run, bring to mind the point of focus you chose and concentrate on it. Tell yourself that there is nothing more important than that thought or image.If you were doing a seated meditation, you would close your eyes – but closing your eyes isn't a good idea while running. This is one of the reasons a visual point of focus may not work as well for running meditation.
Assume you've decided to make the sound of your feet your point of focus. Gradually start focusing on that sound, pushing all other sounds into the background. Think about how the ground feels and connect that feeling with the sound of your footsteps.
As you increase your focus, increase your speed until you're running at a comfortable pace.

, Especially if you're new to meditation, you'll find that the more relaxed and open your mind becomes, the more your mind will drift to seemingly urgent thoughts or interesting observations.Keep in mind that it can take weeks to train your mind to meditate effectively – combining meditation with running is no different.
If you're not a regular runner, you also may find that your muscles aren't ready, or that your cardiovascular system isn't up to the challenge. It's okay to slow to a walk if necessary.
Combining meditation and running isn't like other sorts of exercise, where you're pushing your body to the limit. Rather, you want to be comfortable with the activity so you can keep your mind tuned to your point of focus.

, The point of meditation is to stay in the moment. If you find yourself thinking about something other than your running, your point of focus, or your environment, take note of that thought and save it for later.Rather than cutting off the thought or trying to stop it from happening, let it come. When it does come, acknowledge it and allow it to recede on its own.
Being aware of your thoughts rather than letting your mind wander unconsciously is part of the practice of meditation. You may have heard that meditation means clearing your mind and thinking about nothing, but this is not entirely the case.
For example, suppose you are deep in your meditation and running when suddenly you think ""Oh wow, I have to do laundry tonight or I'll have nothing to wear tomorrow!"" Acknowledge that thought and say to yourself ""I will do laundry tonight."" Then return to your point of focus.

, Meditation isn't a competition, and you shouldn't allow yourself to get angry or frustrated if you find it difficult to concentrate on your point of focus. Avoid attaching negativity or self-criticism to the fact that your mind wanders.Your natural instinct may be to mentally chide yourself for getting distracted – try not to do this. Just gently guide your mind back to your chosen point of focus.
This doesn't mean you should ignore other thoughts, just that you shouldn't get caught up in them or follow them.

, If you have difficulty maintaining your focus at first, you may want to use a guided running meditation. Search on your favorite music service for an album or playlist that you can download and listen to on your runs.Guided meditation albums typically incorporate gentle music or ambient sounds with a voice chanting a phrase or word on which you can focus.
Some guided meditations will direct your attention toward different things, such as the sound of your footsteps, the wind in the trees, or your breath.
Make sure you choose a guided meditation that is designed to be used in active or dynamic meditation, rather than one that is designed for a seated meditation.
You can use other running playlists or albums as well. Simply select one where the beats per minute roughly match your running pace, and use it to focus your attention.

, Especially if you're a beginner with little experience in meditation, you'll find it difficult to maintain your focus for extended periods of time. Meditation is exercise for your mind just like running is exercise for your body.If you're a beginner, start small. Keep in mind that just as you can't wake up one day and decide you're going to run a 5k with no running experience whatsoever, you also can't go from not meditating at all to meditating for 20 minutes straight.
Try meditating for 30 seconds, then resting and letting your mind wander for 30 seconds. Then return to your point of focus for 30 seconds.
If 30 seconds is too difficult, take it down a notch and start in 10 second increments. As meditation becomes easier, you can gradually increase this time.

, Even if you do other types of exercise two or three days a week, you should try to make time for meditative running every day, even if it's only for 10 minutes or so. While it is physical activity, combining meditation and running is not necessarily designed to give you a good workout.Use other workouts for strength training or to lose weight. Meditative running is just as much about your mental health as it is your physical health.
Because of the meditative aspect, you may find that you get more value from meditative running if you do it at the end of the day rather than first thing in the morning.
Try to schedule your meditative running session at the time of your day when your stress is at its highest. For example, if you find that you get stressed over the course of the workday, culminating in your commute home, you might want to go on a meditative run on your way home from work each day.

, Particularly if you engage in exercise or other athletic pursuits, you probably have a relatively competitive nature. You may be accustomed to setting regular fitness goals to accomplish within a set period of time.The point of meditative running is to explore yourself and your consciousness, and relax your mind and body. Apart from that, there is no goal. Meditation isn't competitive, and you shouldn't be striving for some particular goal.
If you continue doing meditative running, do so because it adds something to your life and makes you feel more at peace. Don't do it because you think you'll achieve something in particular.
This same mentality holds if you start to think that there's no point in your meditative running, or that you're not getting any benefit from it. While it may take you awhile to adjust your mindset, you ultimately want to keep your meditative running practice apart from any other exercise or fitness goals you have.

, One way to recognize your gains from your meditative running, as well as keep track of any ideas you get while on your run, is to keep a small notebook to take with you on your runs so you can jot anything down afterward.The presence of this notebook is a good way to avoid getting attached to thoughts when your mind wanders. Just tell yourself that you'll write the idea down when you finish your run.
Over time, if you read back through these notes you may start to notice that your thoughts are becoming clearer and more focused, and that you have more of a handle on how to deal with stressful situations.
Don't look at your journal as a requirement or a chore. If you have nothing to write down after a run, don't force yourself to write something down just for the sake of making an entry.

Maintain pace with relaxed form.,
Pay attention to your 400 split and act accordingly.,
Keep pressure on the gas pedal, but again, keep the shoulders relaxed and focus on good form with 300 to go.,
As you make the turn, an elephant will feel as if it jumped on your shoulders as the lactic acid shuts down more and more muscle fibers in your legs.,
Afterwards, make sure you immediately drink a sports drink and consume some carbohydrates to assist in proper recovery.",How to Complete an 800 Meter Race," When the gun goes off, do NOT sprint your hardest. It may seem tempting to do, especially if others around you are doing it. But this will cause you to burn out quickly, and by the time you reach 400 meters, you'll be burnt out and done for. It doesn't matter how good or experienced you are at running. Keep an even, natural pace. Don't worry, you'll soon pass the others who used up all their energy with the first lap.   You see, an 800 meter dash is a pure mix of stamina and speed. You need both if you want to succeed. During the first lap, keep a steady and even pace. Not to fast, but definitely not to slow. When you reach your second lap, pick up the pace about 30%. And when you get to the last 200 meters, push yourself forward and use up any energy you have left. Don't spare one drop. If you haven't used up all your energy in the first lap, then this shouldn't be too difficult, and you'll be able to zip right past the stupid person who sprinted half the way.;
, Once you get in your rhythm for the first 200 meters, try not to slow down, although inevitably you will. Focus point to point (every 100 meter line works, and at the end of the race, 50 meter markers or even 10 meter markers) to work your way around the track.

, By the time you reach the starting line again you should feel tired, but relaxed. If you can't accelerate after 400 meters (not that you should), you went out too fast. Your 400 split should be NO FASTER than 5 seconds compared to your second 400, and ideally more like 1-2 for the distance runner and 3-4 for the 400/800 runner. If the 400 split is slow, plan to make a strong move at 300 to go in order to maximize passing on the straights.

, This is the time to put yourself into appropriate position for the last 150. Put yourself in a position that you are not boxed in (i.e. have a person directly on your shoulder preventing your moving around a runner slowing). Again, know your race (should I be near the front, did the leaders go out too fast, is this going to be a negatively split race, etc.).

, Rock your pelvis forward, make sure your wrists are cocked to make yourself more springy, and focus on really driving that knee forward to compensate. (When on the final sprint focus on your arms and not your legs. Pump your arms faster and your legs will follow. Trust your legs to know how to keep moving.) If you want to decelerate, do so, but most of the time, the person who wins is the one who slows least. Pick your lane, and just continue driving until you crossed the finish line.

, A light jog also helps pump blood, and thus increase removal of the lactic acid from muscles, especially if you are racing again that day. The first hour is the most crucial to recover, just like for lifting.

To be world-class, however, you have to have a certain genetic predisposition to speed.Look at your family. How athletic are your parents or grandparents? Are any of your older family members professional level athletes?
Think about yourself as a child. Were you always faster than other kids? Do you possess a certain untrained natural athleticism?;
, When you are considering becoming a professional athlete, you want to begin early.


Being on a team will help give you accountability in your training. You’ll be able to have personalized coaching and build a community with your team. You’ll get experience running on difference tracks.
On a team you’ll also learn to use starting blocks, which is an important part of being a competitive sprinter, as your race will be over in less than one minute, so you have to start out strong.

, Even if you’re on a team, if you want to be a professional, you’ll need to train as much as you can.


You’ll want to incorporate basic gym strength training like squats, bench pressing and chin-ups into your workout at least every other day for an hour. Create a basic gym routine, and try to increase your reps every week.
This strength training is important because start speed is largely based on your muscle mass and overall strength in both your upper and lower body. As a sprinter, extra training is the only way to significantly increase upper body mass.Train on the track. You can often use a school track whenever it’s not in use. Practice your sprints in intervals with a few minutes of rest in between. Set weekly time goals for yourself. Try adding short sprints up hills to strength your fast twitch muscles, which are the leg muscles that set sprinters apart from long distance runners.
Your exact routine will depend on your sprint distance. You should plan a sprint workout on the days that you aren’t doing strength training, at least three days a week.
An example of a sprint training workout for running 200m races is as follows: 5 sets of 20 meter sprints, 4 sets of 30, 3 sets of 40, 3 sets of 30, 3 sets of 40, 3 sets of 50, 1 set of 60, and then 5 sets of 30. After each set, you should walk back to the start for a breath. After completing this routine, you should take a two-minute walking break, and then repeat the entire routine one more time.
If you are younger, showing your parents that you are dedicated to practicing on your own will make them see that you’re serious about being a professional sprinter.

, If you are serious about becoming a professional and have the means to do so, you should consider getting a private running coach.


Certified running coaches have training that will enable them to tailor your workouts to your specific needs and help you set realistic goals.Having a coach also increases your accountability for completing extra workouts outside of team practices.
Your coach will be able to watch you closely and give you performance-based corrections on your form.

, Nutrition is an important part of being a sprinter. You want to make sure that you stay at a lean, consistent weight with a high muscle mass. Your diet should provide you with the energy you need to complete your training. .


Incorporate protein. For every pound that you weigh, you should eat one gram of protein. This could be in the form of protein powder in smoothies or lean meats.
Eat lots of fruit and dark green leafy vegetables. As a sprinter, you don’t need as many simple carbohydrates as long distance runners. Try to get your carbs from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water, and drink sports drinks with electrolytes after workouts.
Keep a food diary. Write down everything you eat. You’ll be able to use this information to see how your nutrition is affecting your running.

, To become the fastest sprinter that you can be, you need to have flawless technique in addition to raw speed.


Starting is important. At the start, your bodyweight should be evenly distributed between your four contact points. Push off with both legs. As the front leg straightens, and your back leg comes forward.
In the acceleration phase, your lean begins to decrease. Your back becomes straighter. Legs reach higher. The body remains aligned upright.
Add technique exercises, like knee raises and flicks to your every day training routine., When you are working to become an elite athlete, it’s important to seek out corrections and criticism.


After your school track and field meets, personally ask your coach what you could improve upon in your technique.
Take this feedback, and use it to tailor your supplemental training exercises.

, In a sport like sprinting, improvements are often numerically very small.


Keep a notebook or computer spreadsheet up to date with all of your times and when you ran them. Add in goals to reach by certain dates.
With this, you’ll be able to look back and check your progress.

, In sprinting, athletes win by small increments. You want to make sure you are using proper footwear to ensure you perform your best and don’t get hurt.


Look for shoes built for speed.Different types of running shoes suit different types of running professionals.
Get a fitting. Most local running shops will have knowledgeable staff that will help you find shoes that fit you well. Many even have treadmills and systems that enable you to find the perfect shoe for your running style and foot.

, Once you graduate from school, it can be beneficial to join a local track and field club team. This will give you continued support and accountability.


If you live in the U.S., you can use the USA Track and Field club search to find one.
Different clubs allow different ages to compete. Some are open to all athletes, some are youth-only, and some only allow 18 and over master adult athletes.
Before you graduate, you can join a club in addition to your school’s team. Once you graduate, you’ll be able to intensify your involvement.

, As you’re becoming a professional, you want to compete as often as you can. This way you’ll have evidence of your professional record, as some prestigious races or teams, such as the Olympics, have specific eligibility times that you’ll need to be able to prove.

, Even as you start to compete more, you want to make sure that you maintain your regular training schedule and stay healthy.

, As an athlete, you want to know how other sprinters are competing. Make sure to keep current on record breaking times.Keeping up with top athletes will help you to set realistic goals for yourself.
For example, Usain Bolt set the 100m world record in 2009 with a time of 9.58 seconds.

Start with downward dog.,
Stretch your upper body with upward dog.,
Strengthen your legs and glutes with chair pose.,
Step into a lunge.,
Open your shoulders with bridge pose.",How to Do Yoga to Improve Your Running1," Downward dog is a whole-body stretch and is a good pose to get the blood flowing and start your practice. It can help you find length in your spine as well as building an active and stable core.Get onto all fours with your knees under your hips and your wrists directly under your shoulders or a little forward. Tuck your toes under, and on an exhale lift your hips toward the ceiling, extending your arms and legs so that you're in an upside-down ""V"" position.
Hold this pose for 5 to 10 breaths. With every inhale, focus on pulling towards the ceiling, away from your wrists. With every exhale, focus on pressing through your heels to the floor.;
, Runners often have a weaker upper body, making upward dog a good pose to build upper body strength, targeting your core muscles in particular as well as strengthening your spine.The best way to start this pose is to move into it from downward facing dog. Lower your body forward on an exhale into a modified plank position, dropping your hips to the floor and rolling over your toes to rest the tops of your feet on the floor.
Press your palms down and lift the crown of your head to the ceiling, rolling your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades melt down your back in line with your spine. You should feel a stretch as your chest opens.
Hold this pose for 5 to 10 breaths, then lift your hips on an exhale to return to downward facing dog.
You can create a flow moving between downward dog and upward dog in time with your breath, with a movement for each breath.

, Chair pose is a simple but effective pose suitable even for beginners to yoga practice. This pose will challenge your core as well as building strength in your upper legs.To do the pose, start in a standing position with your feet, knees, and thighs touching. On an exhale, lower your hips as though you are sitting in a chair. Extend your arms over your head.
Engage your core and hold the pose for 5 to 10 breaths, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. Return to stand.
You also can add a twist to chair pose by pressing your palms together in front of your heart. On an exhale twist your upper body, bringing your left elbow to the outside of your right knee. Inhale back to center and repeat the twist on the other side.

, The lunge pose strengthens your entire body, with focus on building and stabilizing your core to bring your body into alignment. To move into this pose from standing position after chair pose, simply step your right leg back.Your right leg should be straight behind you, your left leg bent at a 90-degree angle with your knee directly over your ankle.
There are several variations to this pose, so find the one that feels good for you. You can keep your arms at your hips, or reach them overhead, keeping your back straight and your shoulders rolled down alongside your spine.
To do the arrow lunge, keep your arms extended overhead and reach forward. To add a twist, press your palms together in front of your heart and twist your torso, keeping your hips straight. Rest your right elbow on the outside of your left knee.
Hold this pose for a couple of breaths, then on an exhale come back to center stand and repeat on the other side.

, Bridge pose is a backbend that not only creates space in your chest and the front of your body, but also strengthens your core. This pose can serve as a counterbalance to your running stance, particularly if you hunch forward.Lie on your back and bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the ground. Rest your arms at your sides, and scoot your heels back in line with your fingertips.
On an exhale, lift your hips, keeping your knees together. You might imagine you're holding a block between your knees to keep them from splaying out.
On an inhale, lower your hips back down to the ground in a controlled movement. Lift again with the next exhale.
Repeat the movement 5 to 10 times in time with your breath, keeping your shoulder blades tucked in and your shoulders rolled back so that your elbow creases face up toward the ceiling.

Include a wall sit.",How to Do a Bodyweight Workout for Runners1," It is important to warm up your muscles before you begin your workout. This can help to reduce the chances of injury and promote blood flow to your legs. You can warm up by going for a run or by simply walking or jogging in place for about five to 10 minutes.;
, Squats are one of the best exercises you can do if you are a runner. Squats work your thighs, glutes, and other muscles in your legs. Try doing 30 seconds of squats to kick off your strength training routine.To do a squat, stand with your feet about shoulder width apart and then bend at your knees and hips as if you are going to sit down. Then, stand back up and repeat the move.
When you do squats, make sure that your knees are aligned with your ankles. Do not allow your knees to go over your toes. You should be able to see your toes. Also, keep your back straight, abs contracted, and head up.

, Lunges will also help to build your running muscles, so make sure to incorporate some lunges into your strength training routine. You can lunge across the room or lunge in place. Just make sure that you practice good form and work both legs evenly.


To do a lunge, stand with your feet about shoulder width apart and then take one big step forward with one leg. As you plant the foot, allow the knee of your back leg to drop until your front leg is bent at a 90 degree angle. Then, return your back leg to the start position so that your feet are side by side again before doing the next lunge.
Try lunging for one minute at a time or do 20 lunges on each side. Repeat this three times for maximum benefit.
As you do lunges, make sure that your knees are aligned over your ankles. Do not allow your knees to go past your toes.

, It also helps to have strong calf muscles when you are a runner. To ensure that your calves get some good attention, try adding some calf raises to the routine. You can do calf raises on a flat surface or with your heels hanging off of a small ledge, such as a step.


To do a calf raise, stand with your feet about shoulder width apart and then rise up onto your tiptoes. Then, slowly lower your heels back to the ground.
Repeat this exercise for 30 seconds and do three sets.

, Leg raises can target muscles in the sides and backs of your legs, which can help to improve your running. Make sure that you add some leg raises to your body weight routine to ensure that these muscles get a good workout.


To do a side leg raise, lay on one side and then slowly lift the opposite leg up as far as it will comfortably go. Then bring it back down to the other leg.Repeat this exercise for 30 seconds on one leg and then switch sides. Do three sets on each side for best results.
To do a rear leg raise, get on all fours and then slowly press one foot out behind you. Press the foot up into the air as if you are kicking something in slow motion. Then, bring the leg back down and repeat. Do this for 30 seconds on each side. Repeat the exercise three times on each side.

, Wall sits work your thighs and they are easy to do. All you need is a sturdy wall and some traction against the floor to stabilize yourself. Stand with your back against the wall and then slowly slide down as if you are sliding down onto a chair. As you do so, walk your feet out until your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle.Hold this position for 60 seconds and then slide back up the wall to come out of it. Repeat the exercise two more times.
As you do the wall sit, check to see if you can see your toes. Your knees should be aligned right over your ankles so that your toes are still visible.
Wear sneakers if the floor is slippery.

Take your pulse.,
Find your maximum heart rate.,
Determine your heart rate reserve (HRR).,
Identify your target zone.",How to Control Your Treadmill Workout Using Your Heart Rate1," If you don't have an individual heart rate monitor, you can take your pulse to determine your heart rate. To find your target heart rate, you must first determine the number of times your heart contracts (or ""beats"") in a minute while you're at rest.First thing in the morning is the best time to measure your resting heart rate. At other times during the day, your heart rate may differ in response to other activity. Use the radial artery in your wrist or the carotid artery in your neck.
Place your index and third fingers over the artery you're using. The radial artery is between the bones on the thumb-side of your wrist. The carotid artery is on your neck, next to your windpipe.
Set a timer for 30 seconds and count the beats. Then multiply by two to get the number of beats per minute (bpm). For reference, the average adult's resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm. If you're well outside that range, you may want to check it again to be sure.
Keep in mind that you should take your pulse once every few weeks or so and adjust your resting heart rate as necessary. It may change if you start engaging in regular exercise or make other lifestyle changes.;
, If you engage in physical exertion that causes your heart to beat beyond your maximum heart rate, you can cause it serious damage. You can find your maximum heart rate using the simple equation of 220 minus your age.For example, a 24-year-old person would have a maximum heart rate of 196 (220 – 24 = 196).
The level of intensity and frequency with which you exercise doesn't affect your maximum heart rate, nor is it affected by gender. However, it will decrease with age.

, The difference between your maximum heart rate and your resting heart rate is your HRR. This is the range within which you can safely exercise without damaging your heart.Subtract the resting heart rate you found when you took your pulse from the maximum heart rate you determined using the general equation.
For example, if the 24-year-old from the previous example had a resting heart rate of 80 bpm, they would have an HRR of 116 (196 – 80 = 116).

, You can use all of these rates you've found to determine the intensity level of any exercise that causes your heart to beat that quickly. On the treadmill, the range you use will depend on your goals for exercise.If you want to increase your cardiovascular strength, aim to spend the bulk of your treadmill workout in the aerobic zone, which is defined as 70 to 80 percent of your maximum heart rate. Typically you can reach this zone with a steady jog.
If you want to burn calories and increase your overall fitness, focus on staying between 60 and 70 percent of your maximum heart rate. This is typically achieved with a brisk walk or slow jog.
To find the zone, multiply your HRR by the percentage of your maximum heart rate that you want, then add the result to your resting heart rate. Do the same for both ends of the zone. For example, if the same 24-year-old wanted to work out in the aerobic zone, they would need to keep their heart rate between 161.2 (116 x 0.7 = 81.2; 81.2 + 80 = 161.2) and 172.8 (116 x 0.8 = 92.8; 92.8 + 80 = 172.8).

Keep pushing into your third week.,
Run a mile on your fourth week.,
Eat right.,
Warm up.,
Take breaks.,
Keep a routine.,
Stay safe and prevent injury.",How to Be Able to Run a Mile Without Stopping," There are many different styles of athletic shoes that are available for purchase. However, in order to make your runs safe and more effective you will need to purchase running shoes. Running shoes are designed to properly absorb impact, be lightweight, and are fit specifically to your foot.Cross-training shoes or other athletic shoes won't provided the same support as running shoes.
Avoid running in non-athletic shoes.;
, Most specialty stores will offer to analyze your gait. Staff will have you run on a treadmill and study how you run, where your land on your feet, and decide which running shoe would be right for you. This custom fit can help prevent injury and improve your run. Try visiting a specialty running shoe store when looking for new shoes., Before you start looking for the perfect pair of running shoes, it can be a good idea to learn what type of foot you have. The main feature of the foot that you will be looking at is the arch. Depending on the size and shape of the arch, you will need to buy a pair of shoes that have more or less support in this area.Low arches are more flexible and may roll too far to the inside when running.
Neutral arches are ideal and balance the weight of impact well.
High arches are often inflexible and may cause you to land heavily on the side of your foot.

, This training plan will allow you to slowly increase the amount you can comfortably run, over the course of four weeks. Each week will add more distance and time to your jog, allowing you to meet your goals. Try to follow this schedule for your first week:On days 1, 3 and 5, do four sets of running 1/16th of a mile and walking 3/16th of a mile.
On days 2, 4, and 6, rest or cross train.
On the seventh day, take a break.

, During the second week of training, you will increase the amount you jog and decrease the amount you walk. This will allow you to progress towards your goal of running one mile, without over stressing or over training your body. Follow this schedule for your second week of training:On days 1, 3 and 5, do four sets of running 1/8th of a mile and walking 1/8th of a mile.
On days 2, 4, and 6, rest or cross train.
On the seventh day, take a break.

, During the third week of training, you will be approaching your goal of running one mile without stopping. This week will continue increasing the amount you are able to run and will continue to build cardiovascular endurance. Use this training schedule for you third week of running:On days 1,3 and 5, do four sets of running 3/16th of a mile and walking 1/16th of a mile.
On days 2,4, and 6, rest or cross train.
On the seventh day, take a break.

, Week four is the final week of your training program. You will be able to run a full mile by this point and will be doing so over the course of the week. Enjoy your accomplishment and keep your running routine strong by using this schedule:On days 1,3 and 5, run 1 mile.
On days 2,4, and 6, rest or cross train.
On the seventh day, take a break.

, A big part of getting the most out of your runs is eating correctly. The foods you eat will have an effect on how far you are able to run, your energy levels, and the recovery process. Whenever you have a run coming up, try to keep some of these diet tips in mind to help you feel your best and run your hardest:Foods with carbohydrates and protein are good choices.
Try eating things like bread, pasta, and rice to get carbohydrates in your diet.
Include things like meat, fish, and eggs to get enough protein.

, Before doing any physical activity, it's a good idea to warm up. Warming up before running can help prevent injury and improve the quality of your run. Keep some of these general tips in mind when warming up before a run.Walk for at least 5 to 10 minutes before a run.
Doing some light stretching before a run can help you warm up.
It's a good idea to cool down as well. Try walking for around 5 to 10 minutes after a run.

, Training too often or too much can increase the chances of injury. Although you may enjoy running, taking a break between runs can help keep you safe. Make sure that you are breaking up your running schedule to help keep you running strong.It's recommend that you run every other day.
You might try cross-training on days off. For example, on days you don't run you may lift weights.

, Running requires maintenance. If you take too much time off from running, you will find running more difficult when you come back to it. It's a good idea to make a regular schedule for your runs and stick to it, allowing you to avoid losing your ability to run a mile without stopping.Include rest days in your schedule to allow your body time to recover.
It can be fun to continue increasing the distance you run to help keep your routine interesting.

, Although running can improve your health and fitness, it may also cause injury. Injuries from running most commonly occur when a person pushes themselves too far, trains while injured, or over-trains. If you ever feel any pain during your runs or after, consider taking a break or cutting down on the distance you are running.Make sure to increase distance gradually. Adding too much distance to your runs, without training for it, can cause injury.
Make sure your shoes are a good fit and are suitable for running.
Don't train while injured. Ask your doctor for other exercises you can do while the affected area heals.

Place the soles of your feet together in front of you.
Place your fingers around your toes or the arches of your feet and roll your shoulders back.
As you breathe in, fold forward until you feel a stretch, allowing your elbows to drop so that your forearms are in line with your shins. Hold this position for about 30 seconds, then raise back up on an inhale.

, After regular cobbler's pose, reclining cobbler's pose allows you to open your hips a little more and relieve any tightness that may be present there.From cobbler's pose, simply recline to lie on your back with your hands out to your sides. If you cannot rest your knees on the floor, you may want to place a folded blanket your yoga block under your knees to support them so you can press down to increase the stretch.
Hold this pose for 5 to 10 breaths, then rise back into a sitting position.

, If you're a regular runner, you may have noticed some tightness in your shins and the tops of your feet. Hero pose can stretch and strengthen them to give you greater running stability and help prevent injury.Get down on your mat with your knees together, feet just to the outside of your hips, and lower into a seat between your feet.

Do a plank.,
Try a side plank.,
Incorporate a bridge.",How to Do a Bodyweight Workout for Runners2," Having a strong core is an important part of being a strong runner. Planks are great, versatile exercises for working your core muscles.To do a basic plank, get down on the floor as if you are going to do a push up. You can hold your body weight up on your elbows or on the palms of your hands. Keep your legs straight and your butt down. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart with your toes supporting the weight of your lower body.
Hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds. Then, come down and rest for a minute before repeating the exercise up to two more times.

, A side plank will work your oblique muscles as well as your legs and arm muscles. It is similar to a basic plank, but you will need a little more balance to achieve it.To do a side plank, get into a basic plank position and then lift one arm up and reach up to the ceiling. Turn your shoulders and hips together, keeping them squared like the corners of a cereal box. Your hips and shoulders should be in a vertically stacked position. Keep your abs and thighs firmly contracted as well to avoid uncontrolled twisting of the spine.
Balance in the position for 30 to 60 seconds. Then, slowly come back down into the basic plank position and then come down to rest. Rest for a minute and then repeat the exercise two more times.

, A bridge is a core exercise that also works your hamstrings, glutes, and abs. To perform a bridge pose, you will need to lie down on the floor on your back and then bring your knees up. Place your feet flat on the ground and place your palms on the ground next to your body.When you feel ready, raise up your butt so that only your shoulders, arms, hands, and feet are on the ground. Use your arms and hands to stabilize yourself.
Hold this position for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then, come back down to the ground and rest for a minute before attempting the pose again. Repeat the exercise two more times.

Add explosive moves.,
Stand on one leg.,
Pair the workout with your long run each week.",How to Do a Bodyweight Workout for Runners3," Explosive moves are those that incorporate jumping from a static position. You can turn almost any exercise into an explosive exercise and this will intensify your workout.


For example, you can try jumping from a squat position straight up into the air instead of slowly rising to a standing position. Or, you could also try jumping from one lunge position to the next.
If you have a platform you can jump onto, then this can help to add even more intensity because you will have to shift your body weight enough to get up on the platform. Start small though if you have never done this before, such as by jumping up onto a small platform or step. Make sure that the platform is stable as well.
When you do explosive moves, try to land as softly as possible and keep control of your muscles. Do not allow your knees to collapse or your feet to slam on the ground.The joints of your feet, ankles, knees and hips should stay in the same plane to avoid injury. Keep your knees aligned vertically above your feet.

, Standing on one leg instead of two for an exercise is an easy way to up the intensity. For example, you can try a one leg squat, a one leg calf raise, or a one leg bridge.If an exercise does not feel very challenging, then try switching from two legs to one leg.
If this feels too hard, then switch back to two legs.

, While you might be tempted to pair this routine with a short run or to do the routine on a rest day, you are actually better off doing the routine on the same day as your long run. This will allow you to truly rest on your rest day and your muscles will already be nice and warm.Try doing your body weight exercise routine right after a long run.
If you can’t get out for a run due to weather or other reasons, then a bodyweight routine may also serve as a good substitute for a run.

Enter your personal details.,
Use a separate heart rate monitor.,
Choose a preset workout.",How to Control Your Treadmill Workout Using Your Heart Rate2," Most treadmills require you to create a profile with basic personal information, including your age, gender, height, and weight. Creating this profile allows you to get additional information from the machine, such as the number of calories you've burned over the course of your session.Some more advanced treadmills only need this information and can do all the calculations for you to determine the zones at which you should be exercising. If you're programming your machine this way, keep in mind that you'll have to update it every so often as the information changes if you want to continue to get accurate results.
If you're using a machine at a gym, you probably shouldn't save your profile. Make sure you clear your information after your session is finished so the machine will be ready for the next person.
Keep in mind that if you don't enter any personal information, the treadmill still may show a number for calories burned. That number is calculated using a general formula, and may not be accurate for you, so don't rely on it.

, While many treadmills come equipped with heart rate monitors, they may not be as accurate as a separate heart rate monitor that straps around your chest. If precise accuracy is important to you, you may want to invest in one of these. This will help you determine the speed at which you reach certain heart rates.You can find a heart rate monitor that suits your needs and your budget and most sporting goods stores. If you know exactly what type you want, you also may be able to find one online for less money than you could buy one at a brick-and-mortar store.
Typically you can expect to pay between $50 and $200 for a heart rate monitor of good quality, depending on the type of monitor you choose and the brand.
If you don't want to invest in a separate heart rate monitor, you also can take your pulse yourself. However, keep in mind this won't be as precise because you may have to stop or slow down to safely take your pulse.

, Many treadmills have a number of heart-rate programs available from which you can choose, while simpler machines typically only have one. If there are several, review each one to find the one best suited to your exercise and fitness goals.For example, a hill training workout would provide a better all-over workout for your legs to strengthen and tone the muscles in your lower body and core.
If you don't have much time to work out, you might prefer a more intense workout with short intervals that keep you at optimal levels constantly so you can exercise for a shorter period of time and still get similar results to a longer workout.
A longer interval-training workout can help increase your cardiovascular endurance.
If the machine you're using doesn't have several preset options, you still have the option to create your own program, or to monitor your heart rate in real time and adjust the machine manually.

"
"
Warm up.,
Program your intervals.,
Try doing 10-20-30 interval sessions.,
Cool down.",How to Control Your Treadmill Workout Using Your Heart Rate3," For a treadmill workout, as for any other workout, warming up your muscles and your cardiovascular system before upping the intensity is essential if you want to avoid cramps and other injuries.A brisk walk typically is sufficient as a warm-up for a treadmill workout. Other types of warm ups, such as dynamic stretching, aren't the best warm-up for a treadmill workout. Since you're going to be walking or running, you need to warm up the muscles specifically involved in that activity.
If you're using a preset program, the warm-up segment of the program typically will last around four minutes, with the machine at a low incline and speed – basically a brisk walk.

, If you're creating your own intervals on the treadmill, you'll have to experiment to find the speed at which you enter a particular zone while monitoring your heart rate in real time. Use the information you acquire to set the machine to go at particular rates for particular distances or lengths of time.To program intervals, you might set a five-minute interval at a walking pace as a warm-up. Then set alternating two-minute intervals in which you are working at the aerobic zone. Put recovery intervals between each work interval in which your heart rate lowers. The machine will automatically start the next work interval when your heart rate reaches that rate.
For a more intense workout, a 40 year old person with a resting heart rate of 70 might decide to work within the heart rate range of 120 to 170. That person might aim to keep their heart rate above 120 and then slow down when their heart rate reaches 170.
Refer to your treadmill's manual for specifics on programming the machine. If you're using a machine at a gym, you typically can ask a staff member to assist you. Jot down the steps so you can do it on your own next time.
Keep in mind that your zones may change over time as you start exercising more and your heart gets stronger. Recalculate your zones every couple of weeks to make sure you're getting optimal benefits from your exercise sessions as your cardiovascular strength and endurance increases.

, This specific interval training was developed by researchers at the University of Copenhagen and enabled runners to shave seconds off their personal-best runs, even though they trained for only half the time they normally did.To do this type of training, spend 30 seconds jogging, 20 seconds running at a moderate pace, and 10 seconds running fast. Repeat these one-minute intervals without rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
This high-intensity interval training results in intense calorie burn, because your heart rate constantly changes, which means your body never adjusts to the decrease. For that reason, you'll burn calories as though you were going the whole time at 80 to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate.

, Even if you've programmed rest intervals, you still need to include a longer cool-down period to restore your heart rate to normal levels and complete your exercise session. Cool down is just as important as the warm-up to prevent injuries.A preset program typically includes a four-minute cool-down interval. If you're creating your own program, include a cool-down at the end of at least that long.
Extend the cool-down for a longer period of time if necessary. Don't get off the machine until your heart rate has returned to your HRmin or to 100 beats per minute and you feel you can breathe normally. It doesn't have to lower all the way to your resting heart rate, but it should be close.

Know your abilities.,
Start early.,
Register for a race.,
Map out a training plan.,
Mix easy and long runs with cross training.,
Make your plan fit your life schedule.,
Don't overdo it.,
Eat healthy meals leading up to the race.,
Stay hydrated.,
Rest up.,
Enjoy the race.",How to Train for a Half Marathon," Running coaches advise being able to run 10–15 miles (16–24 km) a week before you consider training for a half marathon. If you're just starting out and haven't built up to this mileage, wait until you've built up enough endurance before you actually sign up for a race.;
, Training for a half marathon takes several months, so pick a race far enough into the future that you'll have time to get fully prepared.


If you're a beginner, plan to train for 20 weeks before racing.
If you're an intermediate runner, give yourself 16 weeks.
If you're an advanced runner, train for 12 weeks.

, The moment you actually pay the fee and officially register for a race is the moment your training deadline has been set. Mark the date on your calendar and prepare yourself for months of exciting buildup to race day.


Consider signing up with a team. Training with teams, or just with a friend, can provide a motivational boost during training.
You could also sign up for a cause. Have friends sponsor you to run for a charity. The thought of letting people down will certainly spur you forward during your training.

, Having a plan in place before you start getting in shape for a marathon helps you stay on track physically and provides motivation to keep going. A plan helps you track your progress and keeps your eyes on the end goal.


Online resources like Runnersworld.com provide different types of training plans to fit different people's needs. Choose a plan that works with your schedule and abilities.
If this is your first race, don't push yourself to select a training plan geared toward getting a fast time. Choose a plan designed to help you finish the race, and next time you can work on beating your personal best time.
As you launch into training, keep a log of your workouts. Take notes on how each one went, and what needs to improve next time.

, Most training plans include a weekly schedule that lays out exactly what to do each day.


Easy runs are recovery runs that you do in between longer runs. They're usually between 3 and 5 miles (4.8 and 8.0 km) long.
Long runs typically take place about once a week, increasing in distance over the course of the training plan. Ultimately, the longest long run will be the race itself.
Cross training is exercise like biking or swimming that you do to strengthen your entire body in preparation for the race.

, Try to fit your runs into your existing routine, so you don't have to shift everything around to make time for training. It's easier to give up when your scheduled runs conflict with other important things in your life.


If you happen to miss a long run one day, switch the training schedule around so you can make up for it the next day.
If you miss an easy run or two, it's not the end of the world. Just pick up where you left off the next day.

, Overexerting yourself during training will put you at risk for getting an injury that could force you to sit out of the race. Don't jeopardize your plans by picking a training schedule that's more advanced than what you can handle.Don't try to make up for missed runs by adding too many miles to your next run. Your body needs to build up to long distances gradually.
If you strain a muscle or feel a pain in your body, take a rest day. Don't risk injury by pushing through.

, Nutrition plays a huge part in your training, and as the race gets closer, make sure your body is in the best shape possible by watching what you eat.


As you run longer distances, 65% of your total calories should come from complex carbs, approximately 20% from unsaturated fats, and 10% from protein.
Load your diet with carbs the week before the marathon so that your body is prepared for the physical challenge.
Don't eat too much the day of the race, since the food might feel heavy in your stomach and slow you down.

, You'll naturally be drinking a lot of water during training, but in the days leading up to the race, make especially sure that you're well hydrated.


As you go on longer runs, practice carrying a water bottle with you, either in your hand or around your waist, so you can stay hydrated as you run.
Avoid drinking excessive alcohol and caffeine in the days before the race, since these dehydrate your body.

, The last long run of your training should be several days before the race, so your body has plenty of time to recover. The day before the race, rest or do an easy run, but don't work out too strenuously.

, Put your training into practice, making sure you pace yourself so you'll be able to cross the finish line.If you have to stop and walk during the race, that's fine. Just pick up running again when you feel ready.
Ask friends and family to come and cheer you on to provide a little extra motivation as you reach your goal.

If you can't run, walk, bike, or do some other aerobic activity for at least 30 minutes at a time, you will need to work up to this first before attempting any running program. The first step is to talk to your doctor about a fitness assessment and to explain your intentions to begin training for a marathon. He or she will be in the best position to advise you on the challenges specific for your body and health issues. Even if you're not very fit right now, take heart. With gradual yet consistent training, your fitness will be restored quickly and you'll be able to keep improving.


Plan for regular medical checkups throughout your training, to ensure that all is well.






Be aware that running can expose latent injuries from previous sports activities. If you have any such old injuries, discuss this with your doctor.






Ensure that your diet is in top shape. A healthy diet will complement your running training, so seek foods high in nutrients and balanced properly for your needs. In particular, both simple and complex carbohydrates are ""long-distance runner's fuel"", so focus on dietary plans that include healthy sources of these. This article isn't the place to detail athlete nutrition but there are plenty of good resources online and in relevant books that you should spend time reading.






Obtain a good anatomy book or app. It's really helpful to understand your body's muscles, bone structure and systems through visualizing them as well as learning about how they contribute to your overall well-being.





;
, Fortunately running gear isn't that expensive and there are plenty of good sports stores selling decent gear. Of most importance is the gear for your feet, and while some marathon runners have always preferred running barefoot, most people prefer a supportive shoe. Shoes should support the foot and protect it; begin by knowing how your foot needs supporting. There are three basic types of foot––pronator (strike the ground with the outside and back of the heel), supinators (land on the outside of the foot and roll outward) and neutral (a combination of these elements). Each foot fall has different possibilities in terms of injuries and the shoe needs to be able to correct or minimize damage from your natural foot fall pattern as best as possible.Your absolute best bet is to get shoes from a store specializing in sports shoes rather than one featuring many other products because this will ensure that the retail staff know everything there is to know about the shoes as specialists. Also be aware that some shoes can be customized for better performance, so you might need to investigate this if current shoes aren't ideal.


Socks: Most marathon runners prefer wearing socks to absorb sweat when running and to prevent chafing against the shoe. There are plenty of choices in the running stores but you may like to experiment with natural and synthetic fibers to see which work best for you.






Hats: Don't run without a hat; choose one that allows for plenty of air circulation and won't come off in a gust of wind. A visor is probably best for hot weather runs, as it lets the heat out easily.






Clothing: For women, get a good, supportive sports bra. For everyone, clothing needs to be relevant to the climate in which you're training. If it's cold, you'll need layers to trap heat; if it's hot, you'll need light clothing that allows the release of heat quickly. There are plenty of modern fabrics suited to both purposes. Consider a running vest/top and shorts, long pants and jacket, crop top and leggings, etc.––visit a reputable sports store that specializes in running clothes and do your research on the types of fabrics and styles available (most runners advise ""ABC"" or ""anything but cotton"" because cotton adds weight by holding in sweat). Try on different outfits to see what feels good and move around in the store to see how the clothing responds.
Eyewear: It's recommended that you wear runner's sunglasses to protect your eyes from UV rays. Runner's sunglasses have such features as special grips, ventilation holes, side glare cutters, shatterproof when dropped, lightweight, etc.






Accessories: Some of the helpful items that you might like to have include a runner's belt to hold food, supplements and water; a water bottle; a night light for training when it's dark; and sun protection (sunscreen). Some runners also like to have their own running watch to pace themselves during a race.







, Before you even begin to train, assess your posture and seek to do the right thing from the outset. While there is no single correct way to hold yourself, you should aim to be relaxed and to hold your torso upright and your spine straight.When running, keep your arms loose at your sides and avoid bringing them up or moving them across your chest from left to right, as this restricts your breathing. Pay attention to your neck and shoulder area––tension here will cause strained running. Find ways to remind yourself to relax when you're running and you'll experience a much smoother running style.


Concentrate on your breathing. Inhale deeply from your diaphragm (pit of your stomach) to ensure deep, even breathing that maximizes your breathing. Shallower breathing is what tends to lead to runner's stitch.Ultimately, your running style is a combination of what feels most comfortable for you, while aiming to stay relaxed and breathing well.

, Train on easy routes to begin with and avoid inclines or anything that might make the run difficult or uncomfortable. Aim for short runs to start getting your body used to the feeling of running. Choose an area that is safe, enjoyable and has plenty to look at so that you find the experience interesting enough to want to repeat it! When you first start out, there will be times when you want to run, then walk. Give in to this desire initially, as it's your body's way of telling you it needs time to adjust. At least you're out there, getting going. Even renowned marathon runners consider walking on occasion during training helps to relieve stiffness.Also, don't try timing yourself or trying to meet set distances for the first few runs. If you don't manage to achieve these goals, you might be tempted to give up. Moreover, whenever you start a run, give yourself 10 minutes before giving up––often it is these first 10 minutes that give you the energy and mindset to keep going.


Run with a friend if possible. This can give you the motivation to run more often and it's nice to have someone to spend time with. Moreover, if you're able to talk to this person as you run, it's a sign that you're pacing yourself properly.It can be very helpful to maintain a running diary, either in paper or digital form. This can help you to track your progress, motivate you and can eventually be the place where you set goals once you're a more confident runner. It is also one way to recall a training pattern that worked well for you, something that might be hard to remember if you haven't written it down. However, don't be a slave to the diary––it's supposed to be a flexible tool, not a rule master.
If you include stretching as part of your running (not everyone agrees that it's essential or helpful), be sure to stretch correctly. Check out instructions for proper stretching online or in relevant books and follow the instructions accurately.

, Even if you don't plan on training with the club regularly, it's a good way to get reputable information and advice and there will undoubtedly be events that you'll be interested in entering to test your progress. It's also a great source of motivation to be among people who have similar goals and interests as you.

, Many runners consider that it is helpful to train for shorter long distance races as a way of gauging how they're doing; shorter distances allow you to assess your performance and readiness for longer distances. Local fun runs of 5 to 10 km (3 - 6 miles) are a great way to start out, as well as any shorter long distance runs held by clubs or running groups. When you actually run the race, don't presume to place yourself at the front; take your time and pace yourself by staying with those of a similar ability to you. Being caught up with fast runners can exhaust you and be a very demoralizing first time experience; eventually you'll get there if that's what you want but for now, it's about pacing yourself and actually getting through the race.


Most races require you to enter well before the date of the race. Keep an eye out online or through other information sources and plan accordingly.
Before any race, check that your gear is well worn in; you don't want to be breaking in new shoes!
Keep well hydrated before, during and after the race. Most races will provide hydration stations which you can take advantage of.

, Once you're comfortable with the long distance races of at least 10 km (6 miles), the next sensible step is to try a half marathon. At this level of running, you're now capable of running the half marathon and you're not far off running a full marathon either.Obviously, this is a lot tougher than the long distance races and your training will need to reflect this. Concentrate on building up your endurance with strength runs, semi-long runs, a longer run and rests. Including one day of rest each week of training is important for recovery. There are many possible training plans for beginner half and full marathon runners and you must spend time doing research into the different suggestions for appropriate training. Importantly, there must be rest days included in each week's schedule and some flexibility built in. When training, include a variety of running experiences, including uphill and downhill, sand running, fartlek, interval training and speed endurance sessions. Moreover, don't just train by running––some cross-training will benefit your overall fitness level, as well as giving your running muscles a deserved break. Suitable cross-training sports include swimming, cycling, gym workouts, walking and fitness dance.


Training plans run from ones that suggest training three days a week to ones that suggest training seven days a week.

, Choosing which marathon you want to run is one of the best ways to inform your ongoing training. Not only do you turn your general plan (running a marathon) into a specific one (running the New York City Marathon on November 5th), but once you've invested the registration fee (typically between $40-$100) you have extra financial incentive to run it, too! In general, once you're ready to give the marathon a go, give yourself around 18 weeks before a marathon to train to an adequate level, more if you feel it's needed. Note––if you have run a half marathon as part of your preparation, you'll need to allow plenty of time for recovery from that race to the time of the marathon race.

When choosing a marathon for the first time, choose one with the least amount of challenges. Avoid anything too hilly, held in hot weather, or at altitude. Choose a marathon course that will work for you, not against you, ideally one at sea level, on a flat course, with cool weather and a large, supportive crowd.
Find a buddy to do the specific marathon with. You'll motivate each other!

, Again, as with the half marathon, you'll need to do the research into an appropriate training plan matching your fitness, abilities and terrain to be run. And you must have a plan––those without one often fail to make the marathon starting line. Any training plan that you choose should involve a gradual building up of distance from the half marathon level. Good plans will start with 3 to 16 km (2 to 10 mile) runs that gradually build up and include varied terrain such as hills and beaches. Importantly, be absolutely aware that there are no shortcuts to building up your mileage endurance––anything offering a build-up to readiness within two months or less should be avoided like the plague! Try to vary some of your training areas––after a time, monotony may set in and a change of scenery can help improve your enthusiasm, as well as keeping a firm eye on your goal. Also, every single thing you're likely to wear or try on the day of the marathon needs to have been tried before the marathon––this means breaking in shoes and clothes, knowing your pace and testing all of your equipment.


Increasing mileage should occur gradually within any program chosen, and should not increase by more than 5 miles (8 km) weekly.Focus intently on establishing a healthy marathon pace. It's very important to understand that this pace differs from what most people perceive as a ""normal"" pace and you'll need to adapt to it, usually by slowing down somewhat.
Over training is as bad as under training. You'll lose enthusiasm if this happens. Do not respond by upping the training––take your much needed rests instead.
Training should gradually (not suddenly) taper in the final two weeks to protect your body from injury and exhaustion.By the final week, you should be in a position to not run at all in the two days leading up to the race.

, The rest of your life will happen while you train––work and family commitments remain the same! You'll need to talk to people about what you're doing to help them to understand and to ensure that you can get the time needed to attend to your training. As well, their moral support will be vital as much as their preparedness to not see you about much.

Injury and sickness happen. You need to be flexible and allow for recovery––it's fine to miss a day or shorten a run every once in a while, but the important thing is to get back out there as soon as you can. Marathon training is a long, slow process, but it's the only way to reach your goal. Never do away with planned rest days and try to run on them instead––your body needs to recover to prevent injury or illness from gaining a hold; any good marathon training plan should involve a good balance between both running training (stress) and rest (recovery).

, Marathon training isn't only physical––it's also about mental training and there are plenty of things you can do to enhance your ability to complete the race. Some of the things that it's recommended you try include:


Check out the course in advance. Where possible, drive or cycle the marathon course before it happens. That way, you'll know what it's like generally and this will instill in you the importance of pacing yourself well because it is such a long race! Take especial note of particular landmarks and note their distance on your car or bike computer readout.
Even if you can't actually physically trace the course, check it out online through Google Maps to find landmarks, terrain, etc. This will help you to visualize yourself doing the race, an important part of good mental preparation for the race. Study course maps and the profiles, both when you can physically track the race and when you can't, to help you establish good pacing.
Watch previous marathon races for inspiration, or even movies about running marathons.
Listen to inspiring music.
Think positively, use affirmations if you're used to doing so and tell yourself that you can achieve this. Think about the ways you'll deal with pain and despair during the race––what will you think about and concentrate on to distract yourself?
Get the support of others. Family members, friends and fellow racers are all important people who can energize you before and during the marathon. They believe in you too.
Do anything that gives you a sense of purpose and empowerment without depleting your energy.

, Eat healthy carbohydrates but take care not to overeat anything, as you don't want to gain weight in the lead-up to the race. The advice from sports nutritionists is to increase carbohydrate intake from 65 percent to as much as 90 percent of your diet, as well as having sports drinks.However, you should be guided by current suggestions from reliable people such as your doctor, nutrition specialist or relevant information from sports experts.


Typical food eaten by marathon runners includes bread (wholegrain), pasta, cereals and the like. These provide the glycogen that breaks down into glucose for energy as you're running and when your body has broken down your stored glycogen, it then goes after your liver glycogen, after which it goes for your fat which requires more of your precious oxygen to break down the molecules into glucose.Hence, the more stores of glycogen you have, the better.

, On the day, be prepared as with the half marathon––have all your gear and supplies in order and ensure that your training leading up to the marathon day has left you with refreshed and rested muscles (it's recommended to lay off running for two days before the race). Be mentally prepared––all marathon races hurt; it is part of the experience and one for which your regular training and previous races should have prepared you to endure. Keep the goal in mind, which for a beginner is basically to complete the race and gain the satisfaction of reaching the pinnacle of your running goals. Most of all, in spite of the inevitable pain, seek to enjoy the experience––a well prepared marathon runner should be able to find the race fun, especially since the sensation of being part of a crowd of marathon enthusiasts will really give you a boost––use that buzz to propel you onward. Also, many courses have entertainment along the way and plenty of spectators to cheer you along. Take it all in––you've trained for this for months, this is your day!


Line up where you feel comfortable and likely to be among runners of the same level as you––as with the half marathon, avoid pushing your way to the front as a beginner.
Try to maintain a steady pace that seems on the slow side for at least the first half of the race, but feel free to pick it up during the second half if you're feeling good. Don't get caught up in the thrill of the race from the beginning––it'll feel easy the first few miles but that won't last. Marathons are about patience, not speed.
Settle for achieving your marathon running goal within a realistic time, not one that compares you to the champions. If you find you love marathon running after this event, you can aim to build up and become a lot faster over time but for now, don't push things beyond your abilities. It's really important to recognize that until you've run your first marathon ever, you lack experience and have nothing to gauge your performance against, so don't tax yourself with comparisons, assumptions and crazy notions!
Make use of the aid stations to drink regularly. Energy drinks will both hydrate and restore sugar for much needed energy boosts. Hydration also replaces water lost to sweating as your body tries to keep cool and you need to replenish a minimum of 0.5 of a liter of water (17 oz) per every hour.You might ""hit a wall""––this occurs for many marathon runners at around the 32 km (20 mile) mark of the marathon, a feeling that you're running through thick mud and literally hitting a brick wall.It tends to be caused by poor training in the lead up to the marathon and by running at a pace too fast at the commencement of the race, leaving little in reserve for later. To avoid the brick wall experience, know your pace and stick to it from the beginning, avoid the temptation to try to keep up with other runners, eat extra carbohydrates in the lead-up to the race and stay well hydrated during the marathon.

, The marathon is over but you're still pumped. Have someone help you after the race––you'll need warmth, drinks and food. And you'll need a lift home with someone who hasn't just run a marathon. Have it all worked out before you run so that you can let the other person take charge of these things while you bathe in the excitement of your achievement."

Go to a shoe store and have your gait measured so that you know what kind of running shoes will work best for you., If you are starting from scratch, do not jump head first into running or sprinting to train. You need to acclimate your lungs and the rest of your body to the motion it will be doing. Begin with two or three days of workouts each week, with the first few workouts being a mixture of walking and running. From there you can build up to running the full length of your race., There is no secret, perfect formula for training for a running race--everyone is different, and as such, each training schedule is different. However, your training routine should consist of long distance running where you work on your pace, interval training to build up your strength, cross-training (like biking, swimming, strength training), and shorter runs., Your goal should be to reach a pace that you can fall into immediately and that you can keep up throughout the race. Different race lengths will call for different paces. For instance:For a 5K: You will want to find the fastest pace that you can run at maintain for the entire 5K.
For a 15K: Find a pace that you can maintain throughout the entire race without slowing down at all in the second half of the race, which is when most people lose speed.

, While you are racing against other runners, you are actually fighting a battle with your own mind. Part of your may want to call it quits halfway through. What you need to do is prepare your mind for the struggle ahead. First, you must overcome your desire to sprint as soon as the race begins--patience it a virtue, particularly when running a half or full marathon.#*While working out, practice maintaining your pace as you get tired--don’t let yourself let up.


While running longer runs, keep yourself from slowing down in the last miles--this will help you get in the mindset of not letting up during the race, even when you are exhausted.

, Run or walk the course a couple of times to get an idea of what it will be like when you are actually in the race. Plot out port-o-potty locations and hydration stations. You may even want to map out how you will approach each mile. Will you need to save up energy for an uphill mile two-thirds of the way into the race?, Many avid runners say that it is important not to try anything new on race day. Practice your routine with a few long runs late in your training. This means waking up when you will wake up on race day, put on the outfit you will wear and the shoes you will race in, and eat the breakfast you plan on eating for race day. Figure out what works before for you and plan to stick to it on racing day.Good breakfast items to eat before a race include: A bagel with peanut butter, oatmeal with milk, toast, dried fruit, and yogurt. If you tend to feel nervous or nauseous before a race, stick to smoothies or juices.

, It is important to have a plan going into the race. Will you stick with the fastest runners the whole way? Maybe you’ll stay with the second pack and slowly work your way past them. Whatever your plan, have a rough outline of how you will face the race. At the same time, stay flexible--often situations arise that you didn’t plan for. Maybe you feel like you can outrun the second pack quickly so you head up to the group of runners at the front., Keeping your pace steady will help you to use oxygen the most efficiently. It also helps to reduce lactate build up. An even pace is especially good for long races when it becomes imperative to keep your body working at the same level of strength for a great distance., It is important to keep your pace steady, even at the beginning of the race when your pace feels easy, and at the end when it feels like a struggle to keep the same speed. Holding back and falling into your groove, rather than sprinting away at start of the race, will help you to conserve the energy you will need to finish first at the end of the race.Staying at a steady pace will allow you to catch up to other runners who started the race off too quickly. You’ll be sure to get a boost of confidence every time you pass another runner.

, This is particularly important if you are running anything longer than a 5K. The second half of the race will be a challenge--you will be tired and your body will start rebelling. Keeping your mind relaxed during the first half of the race will help you to focus and find determination in the second part of the race., While it is generally best to try to keep your pace even, if you have a person in mind that you really want to beat, you will want to keep a bit closer pace with that person. If he starts out quickly, make sure that you keep him within your sights without exerting all of your energy. If he gets a little ahead, switch back into your steady pace and plan to catch him later on--his burst of speed at the beginning will probably weigh heavily on him later., When you have someone in front of you and you want to pass them, its important to feel and appear strong. To do this, stay directly behind them until you are ready to pass them. When you do pass them, increase your speed slightly and keep at that pace until you are at least 30 yards (27.4 m) ahead of that runner. That person will mentally write you off as someone who they will either have to catch up to later or who will be finishing before them.

, Your environment can play a large part in whether you win or lose a race. In particular wind and heat are two factors that can really bring a runner down. If it is very windy on the day of your race, plan to stay in a group. When you run in the middle of a group, the other runners will act as a barrier for the wind, which will help you to conserve energy since you won’t be fighting against the breeze.To combat the heat, start out at a conservative pace that is a little slower than you would normally run. Many other runners won’t do this and you will be able to pass them as the fade away from heat and exhaustion.

, No matter how tired you are or how concerned about the proximity of other runners you might be, it is important to keep looking forward. If you look back and other runners see you doing so, it will give them a mental boost because they will know that you are tired and that they can pass you when they choose.

, If long distances aren’t your thing, sprinting might turn out to be a great option for you. Of course, sprinting is taxing on the body, but with tips and tricks, you’ll be speeding your way across the finish line.

, Whether you are on a high school, collegiate, or city team, you will need to train hard for your cross country race.

, If you are more into walking than running, you can still cross a finish line first. Prepare for a walking race and beat your competitors.

, Cycling is a challenging, fun, and incredibly satisfying endeavor. Make it more satisfying by coming in first.

, Splash your way to gold by following these tips and preparation techniques.

Motivate yourself to win.,
Focus on the finish line.,
If you are in front, don't bother looking behind you.,
If you are coming from behind, don't worry about how far behind you are.,
Right before you pass the finish line, bend down so your chest passes before your legs.,
Say ""good job"" and shake the hand of the person you were neck and neck with at the end of the race.

,
Make sure you get some water, cool down, and stretch.,
Evaluate yourself after the race.,
Good Luck!

,
Get adrenaline for the last few meters and go all the way pretend that the finish line is a few meters back that way you sprint all the way to the end.

","How to ""Kick It"" in the End of a Race"," Before the race even starts, you should have an, ""I will do well,"" mindset. If you don't think you will do well you won't do well.;
, Once you can see the finish line, you should be running all out. Don't worry about coming up short. It's better to try to fail than to never try at all.

, You can tell if someone's behind you by listening to their breathing and footsteps. Looking back will only slow you down. Instead, think, ""this person isn't beating me,"" and run as fast as your legs will carry you.

, Try to catch up to them anyway. While you may not win, it will improve your time and keep others from passing you. Have that same, ""this person isn't beating me,"" mindset and run as fast as your legs will carry you.

, The officials usually stop the clock as the runner's chest passes the finish line, not their legs, as it would be harder to tell who won in a close call. This could make the difference between 1st and 2nd place. (See the picture of the bunny.) Do this in races that don´t use time chips. When you are in a race that uses time chips thrust the foot that has the time chip first to lose some extra milliseconds.

,, If you have another event, go to that event.

, If you felt like you had energy to do another lap at the end, you should have probably kicked sooner. But, if you are exhausted and feel pushed to your limit, you probably kicked at the right time.

Finish the race.",How to Run a 4X100 Relay," The ideal first runner has an explosive takeoff and never gets disqualified for false starts. This position also requires fast running around the bend of the oval track., The second runner should perfect their baton handling skills, as the second leg involves both receiving and passing the baton. This is a straight leg, so this is a good spot for a fast sprinter who is not really good at bends/curves.This is a great spot for your fastest runner if they are much faster than the other three.This is especially true if your fastest runner is also great at baton handoffs.

, In general, shorter runners are best around curves because they can accelerate faster than taller runners. This position also benefits from good baton handoff skills, and from the ability to compete under the pressure.Although unorthodox, it could be smart to put your fastest runner here if they are also good on bends. A 200m specialist could do well on this leg., Many teams place their fastest runner last, perhaps so they can claim the glory! In fact, psychology may be more important than raw speed. This runner cannot get discouraged if they start the fourth leg behind the other teams. Choose a competitor who thrives under end of race pressure.If your two fastest runners are much faster than the other two, place them second and fourth. This allows you to maximize the distance they run.At high levels of competition, choose a runner with advanced finishing techniques.This includes ""lifting,"" a running form with light ground contact and rapid knee lifts, and lunging, a carefully timed forward fall so the chest crosses the finish line sooner., All of your planning above will fall apart if an athlete can't perform consistent baton handoffs. Consider these problems before you finalize the positions, and don't hesitate to rearrange if issues arise during practice:


Size differences: If one runner is much taller than another, they may have trouble exchanging batons smoothly. Space them out so they don’t have to do a baton exchange.If a pair of athletes do not practice well together for temperamental reasons, and the coach cannot solve this problem, consider rearranging so they don't have a handoff together.
If one athlete is particularly poor at passing, consider placing them fourth. If an athlete is poor at receiving, consider putting them first.

, There are generally three methods of passing the baton: the upsweep, the down sweep, and the push pass. Try all three and see which your teammates prefer:Upsweep: the outgoing runner runs with their hand behind them at hip level, palm down and thumb outstretched to form a V shape. The incoming runner inserts the baton upward between the thumb and fingers.
Downsweep: similar to the upsweep, but the outgoing runner's hand is palm up and receives the baton in a downward motion.
Push pass: the outgoing runner holds their arm high up behind them, with the palm sideways and the thumb pointing down. The incoming runner holds the baton vertically and pushes it into the palm.

, When all goes well, the relay race is a smooth series of transfers, with no awkward jerks across the lane or switching from an athlete's left hand to the right. Practice this pattern until all four runners find it automatic:First runner holds baton in right hand and runs on the inside edge of the lane.
Second runner holds baton in left hand and stays on the outside.
Third runner holds baton in right hand and stays on the inside.
Fourth runner holds baton in left hand and receives on the outside.

, Each baton handoff must occur inside a 20-meter changeover zone, between two yellow marks. The outgoing runner can start running up to 10 meters ahead of the changeover zone, but can only receive the baton within the zone. Use tactics as well as trial and error to find an exchange position that maximizes speed and smooth handoffs:


Ideally, you can exchange the baton about 5 meters from the end of the zone.This gives the outgoing runner more time to accelerate before receiving.If the athletes have trouble with a quick handoff, or if they get nervous and slow down while waiting, exchange the baton just past the middle of the zone.If one athlete is significantly faster than the others, they can receive earlier in the zone, carrying the baton for more than 100 meters.

, A huge mistake in relay racing is to slow down before you release the baton. The best way to prevent this is to form the habit of ""running through the zone."" Keep up a full sprint until you're about halfway through the next leg.If both runners have positioned themselves well (on opposite sides of the lane), the incoming runner should be able to run close behind without fearing a collision.

, The 4x100 is all about speed. To prepare for the race, do drills such as hill sprints, suicides, and sprinting around comes to work on your agility and speed. Hill sprints are especially good for improving acceleration., You don’t want the first time you run the race to be at the track meet or event. Run the event several times at least, at full speed. Have a coach or friend who is knowledgeable about running time each of your attempts. Also, have your friend or coach watch each runner and offer any critiques that they might have., After doing warm ups, make sure that every runner is in position. The first runner should be positioned on the starting blocks, holding the baton in his or her right hand.The second runner should be positioned at the acceleration zone 10 meters before the first exchange zone. Each exchange zone is marked on most tracks by large, usually red, triangles. There should be a smaller triangle that marks the acceleration zone, which is where the second runner should be positioned.
The third runner should be at the second acceleration zone before the exchange zone, and the fourth runner should be at the last acceleration zone.

, As soon as the whistle is blown, the first runner should start sprinting. Make sure that they lean in and accelerate through the bend in the track. They will run slightly more than 100 meters to the first exchange zone.


Make sure that the runner runs on the inside of their lane, on the left-hand side, so that they can pass the baton to the next runner’s left hand.

, The first runner, with the baton in their right hand, will approach the exchange zone. The second runner should have their head turned, watching the incoming runner. When the incoming runner is about 7 meters from the outgoing runner, the outgoing runner should turn their head back and start running with their hand out. The first runner will hand the baton over to the second runner, who will take the baton in their left hand if the first runner hold it at his/her right hand.Make sure that the baton exchange happens within the exchange zone because your team will be disqualified if it happens before or after the zone.

, The second runner will a straight leg of the track for another 100 meters. Make sure they are running on the right side of their lane. Meanwhile, the third runner will start running as soon as the second runner approaches the exchange zone. The second runner will pass the baton from his or her left hand into the right hand of the third runner.


Again, be sure that the baton exchange happens within the exchange zone.

, The third runner will run around the bend on the track, the baton in their right hand. As they approach the last exchange zone, the fourth runner will start running with their hand out, and the incoming runner will put the baton in their left hand, making sure the exchange happens within the exchange zone., The fourth runner, with the baton in their left hand, will run another 100 meters past the exchange zone to finish the race. Make sure that the fourth runner doesn’t slow down before the finish line, and instead sprints until they have crossed the line, with the baton still in their hand."

Find someone who is running slightly faster than you.,
Be confident.",How to Be a Fast Runner," Becoming a fast runner requires both dedication and plenty of relevant and consistent practice. A concentration on good posture, good technique and a focus on strategies, will ultimately help you to become a faster runner.;
, This is a long process. Start out slowly and work your way up. Practice running every day and don't run for too long of a distance. Run a short distance one day, then a longer distance the next day you run. A good plan might be something like this:


Day 1: Run 1⁄8 mile (0.2 km)
Day 2: Rest day
Day 3: Run 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km)
Day 4: Rest day
Day 5: Run 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km)
Day 6: Rest day
Day 7: Run 3⁄4 mile (1.2 km)
Day 8: Rest day
Day 9: Run 1 mile (1.6 km)
Day 10: Rest day.








There are many other specific running plans you can follow. Check an online running site or borrow a library book on running training. If you have a coach or trainer, use this person to help formulate an appropriate plan, or ask fellow runners for their suggestions.

, You may have to repeat some running days if you can't accomplish running that distance or it tired you out rather much.

, Encourage yourself; be enthusiastic about your chances. The best runners are those that have faith in themselves and their training; it doesn't matter how long your legs are.


Form a race strategy and review it in your mind. For example: Start slow, get faster, quicker up the hill, or stick with this person, etc. This strategy should be informed by your knowledge of the course, watching other competitors previously, knowing your own limitations and following the advice of your coach or trainer (if you have one).

, Be sure to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep.

, If you begin without stretching or doing a quick exercise routine, it will cause painful muscle cramps and bad aches, especially if you are going to be running for an extended period of time.

, Do not allow having a drink to slow you down. Drinking during a long race will help you stay hydrated and think with more clarity.

, Make sure you feel good before you run. If you are nervous, take deep breaths.

, Begin to raise it as you get closer to the ten metre mark.

, It's okay to charge through the crowd at first, so you won't get boxed in behind a wall of slower people, but if you do, don't waste your energy trying to catch up. Leading into the wind uses an average of 18 percent more energy than drafting (running right behind someone), though many people see this as a ""cheap"" strategy.

, Practice putting your knees up in the lead-up to the race, so that it feels normal during the race.

, When running, stay focused. This includes considering the following:


Don't look behind you to see where people are, it can make you lose seconds that matter.
Keep the focus on yourself; don't think about another runner.

, Don't run looking down or around, this slows you down and breaks your concentration.

, This will help you to stay calm and conserve energy.

, This uses up energy that can be put to better use (running). Many people make this mistake. The best way to run is to relax your hands, rather than clenching them, except in a full sprint. Don't lean your head forward, look straight, not behind you or directly at the ground. Either look about 25 feet (7.6 m) ahead of you at the ground - if you're on uneven terrain, or at the person in front of you - if you're road racing. Keep your head up and your shoes tied!

, If it's a mid distance(half mile) focus more on running hard, kicking out in front of you. Or, over longer distances, where you must keep efficient, you can do this by keeping your elbows at 90˚ angles, placing your hands near your waist, and puffing out your chest. Keep your pelvis underneath you, with your back straight, and don't kick behind you. Raise your knees, and pretend to kick your butt.

, It's okay if you're behind the main pack 30 seconds into the race, but not when you're already well out in front.

, This will decrease the distance that you are running. This is a very important strategy, one that works well.

, It will be hard for them to catch up to you.

, Try to stay with them. This will give you a good indication that you're keeping up and boosts your confidence to a much higher level.

, Remember that 80 percent of a longer distance race is fully mental. Only 20 percent of the battle is physical. And all fast races, whatever their distance, benefit from a good dose of belief in your ability and a willingness to give it all you've got.

How long have you been running?
How often do you run?
Where do you normally run?
Do you have any injuries or areas of concern?;
,, Short distance running will require a lighter shoe, while heavier shoes can be used for long distance running.

, This will be one of the most important deciding factors when choosing a shoe. Examples: Knee pain: a structure shoe with a sturdy heel generally alleviates knee pain. Back pain: a comfort shoe with structural elements is often the best choice

, For example, people often use their shoes for cross training in addition to running. If this is the case, consider a more neutral shoe.

, Outdoor/trail running- a shoe with a lot of traction, prevents slipping and gives proper grip. Indoor/treadmill running- a shoe with a simple outsole, not much traction is needed. Both indoor and outdoor running: a shoe with enough traction but not too much, most running shoes are equipped for both indoor and outdoor running

,, The distance from the tip of the runner's toe to the end of the shoe should be about a thumb's width.

,, Make yourself available in case they need any more help.

Evaluate your fitness level.,
Check out your shoes.,
Begin your workout routine slowly, even if you're in tip-top shape.,
Use mid-training weeks to ramp up your efforts.,
Consider the last few weeks of training to be your wind down time and weeks to rest and prepare for the race.",How to Train for a 5K Run in 10 Weeks," Taking weather and other factors into consideration (if you are testing your fitness level after work or on no sleep), test your endurance to see what you are made of––today.


Take both cardio and muscle fitness into consideration. Although running is mainly a cardio activity, you will need muscular fitness and agility to propel you to the next level.
Measure your strength by taking the push up and sit up test. Track (or have a friend help) how many push ups and sit ups you can do within one minute. Women can perform a modified version of the push up and your fitness level is determined by your age versus the number of push ups or sit ups you can perform. For example, a woman who can do 39 plus push ups in her 30’s is in excellent muscular condition.
Determine your cardio level by taking the three minute step test and the one mile walk test. Both tests measure aerobic fitness but the three minute step test involves stepping up and off a box or a stair for three consecutive minutes. With this test you are measuring your pulse. A good pulse rate for a man between ages of 56 to 65 would be 86 to 94, for example. The one mile walking test basically demonstrates how fast you can walk a mile. Generally speaking, anyone who walks a 20 minute plus mile is considered to within the “poor” range, whereas if you can walk a mile within the 11 to 15 or 18 minute pace, you aren’t doing so poorly.;
, Another important factor before you run a single step are shoes. Everyday sneakers won’t do if you're going to run a 5K, so visit your local running or fitness store or a running shoe clinic for a decent fitting pair. If money is an issue, ask about shoes that may be discontinued or on sale.


Ask the clerk if you can test drive the shoes on a treadmill. The only way you’ll know if the shoes will work is to try them first. Most running stores have an in-store treadmill for a test drive, so go for a slow jog to see if you like the shoes.
Let the clerk know if you have any foot issues. Pronation or flat feet are definitely worth mentioning to the shoe store clerk, as certain brands offer shoes to help keep your feet in line and your body free of injury.

, Unless you run every day, ease into your 5K, or 3.1 mile (5.0 km) run.



The first three weeks should involve running/walking only three days per week. Your body is like a rubber band––pull it too quickly, especially when it's not warmed up and primed, and it will snap (meaning your muscles may cramp and/or tighten). Easing into your workout will set you up for success later in your training.

Week one should involve both light jogging and walking. Even if your goal is to run a fast paced mile, consider week one to be your “warm up” week. On day one, three and five tackle one to two miles (depending on your fitness level) and walk approximately 90 percent of the workout. Jog for one to three minutes and then walk for five, for example. However, do not casually stroll––power walk and then cool down toward the end with a slower walk. Days two, four, six and seven are rest days or you could do yoga or strength training if you are feeling vibrant.

Week two means that it’s time to take training up a notch. Continue with the same pattern of rest days (days two, four, six and seven). However, attempt to do more jogging than walking this week. If your body feels comfortable, try walking only 80 percent of the workout.

Week three is when you should start to get that itch to do more and go harder. You will still be doing the same routine with days off and perhaps still walking 80 percent of the time but you're effectively training your entire cardiovascular system to withstand distance cardio endurance.

, The actual “training” occurs during weeks four through seven. This is when you work on pace, speed and endurance.



Week four is when you ease into your more intense training. You can still take the same number of days off, however instead of walking 80 percent of your workout, you should be running/jogging 50 percent of the time. If you feel comfortable, add another mile so that you're running three complete miles this week.
Add another training day to week five so that you're running/walking on days one, three, five and seven. If you hadn’t increased your mileage to three miles by now, this is the week to do so. Also, practice interval training this week. Run as fast as you can for 30 seconds to one minute and then slow down and walk briskly for three minutes. Repeat this routine for up to one mile and then complete your last two miles at a normal, comfortable pace. Interval training will help you boost your speed and endurance.

Weeks six and seven should mirror each other. These are your most intense weeks throughout the training schedule. Workout on days one, three, five and seven; however, each workout should include three miles with interval training performed at least twice during the week. Attempt to increase your sprint time from one minute to two if possible and, instead of dropping down to a brisk walk, consider jogging in between sprints.

,



Week eight should begin your gradual wind down before race day. Take a long jog and short walk on days one, three and five––no more interval training. Continue running/walking three miles so that your body is completely conditioned to handle it on race day.

Week nine should be light jogs throughout the week. Take your mileage down to two and jog on days one, three, five and seven.

Week 10––you made it! Some experts suggest you only run or jog one or two days before race day. Depending on which day your race lands, avoid running or working out at least one to two days before the race so your body can rest, repair and rejuvenate. Only light jogging three days during this week should do the trick to keep your muscles limber and ready to race.

To begin with, jog around the track a couple of times at a comfortable pace.Don't use up too much energy at this point, you're just warming your muscles up.
It used to be taught to stretch before running. Now experts advise traditional stretches prior to exercising can actually lead to (or even cause) injury.Instead, try dynamic stretches. These are gentle arm and leg swings performed in a smooth, continuous motion, rather than holding a for stretch in a specific position. For example, you can stand perpendicular to a wall and swing your outside leg back and forth, increasing the height which each repetition.Then, turn around and stretch the other leg.
If you have a specific injury or stiffness, (such as a sore hamstring) it may be a good idea to stretch out these areas prior to the main workout.;
, To stay loose, prevent injury, and decrease your aches and pains later, spend a few minutes after every sprinting workout doing some light exercise, such as jogging, and the last five to ten minutes stretching all your muscles. Your legs, ankles, arms, shoulders, and neck all need to be stretched.









Stretching helps remove waste products such as lactic acid that accumulate in your muscles and cause swelling and soreness, and helps them build back up more quickly.
This is generally important for all exercise, but especially for running, which uses the whole body. See How to Stretch for more details on a cool down stretch.

, Once you are starting to get warmed up and limber, do some drills to get your heart pumping and your body ready for real action. You can perform running drills, in which you start off at a brisk pace and accelerate to sprinting speed. There are also many other drills that are great for sprinters:


High knees: Walk while bringing your knees all the way up to your chest.Arm drills: Make L's with your arms, using the elbows as the corner of the L (i.e. a 90-degree angle). Now, just swing your arms forward and backward, using only your shoulders to swing your arms. Alternate movements, driving the elbow of one arm all the way back while the other arm is all the way up to, but not passing, your face (i.e. up to your chin). When you get comfortable with that, increase the speed. Go as fast as you can for as long as you can.Long strides: Take long strides with your legs, using high knees to bring your leg up. The idea is to get as far as you can in as few long steps as possible. Don't put much weight on the front leg (especially the balls of the foot). If you do so, you might lose balance and trip.Back pedals: Turn around and run backwards. Use your heels and reach outwards, in a kicking motion.
Alternate jogging and sprinting: Jog for 10 yards (9.1 m) and burst into a sprint for 50 yards (45.7 m). This exercise is great for shifting gears; the sudden changes in tempo improve your ""burst-speed,"" which will be crucial to your sprinting efforts. In fact, shifting between low- and high-intensity exercise like this is one of the best ways to improve your cardio fitness and endurance,which will help your body pump oxygen more efficiently when you sprint and help keep you from tiring.

, There is no perfect routine for everybody, because every individual has their own needs and their own schedules. Ideally, however, you'll want to set aside at least three days to work on speed and two days to weight-lift.Here's an example schedule:



Monday (Speed Day): Run ten 80-meter stretches (i.e. run 80-meter dashes five times, taking 2 minute breaks between each one), six 70-meter stretches, four 60-meter stretches, three 20-meter stretches and one 100-meter stretch.

Tuesday (Weight-Lifting Day): Go into a weightlifting room and work on everything. Try to keep all of your muscles in shape; you'll need every single one for running, and even more so for sprinting.

Wednesday (Speed/Endurance Day): Run four 300-meter stretches. It's important to get this kind of run and to give it all you’ve got. Endurance training makes your heart stronger, which will make you much faster.

Thursday (Semi-Speed Day): Run five 200-meter stretches, three 100-meter stretches, and two 50-meter stretches.

Friday (Weight-Lifting Day Two): Go back to the gym and increase the challenge level. Once you feel you’ve mastered a certain exercise or piece of equipment, be sure to move on to a new challenge. As your body learns to move a certain way, it becomes more efficient, meaning you do less work for the same activity and hit a plateau. Avoid this by keeping your workout routine fresh.
Don't forget to to warm up before each workout, and to cool down afterwards.
Take the weekend off. You need time to rest and for your muscles to take a break.

, Although the scientific evidence on this remains mixed, many believe running on the balls of your feet may help you move faster. The less time your foot is on the ground the better.








This will be a bit unnatural at first. Try running barefoot, and then emulating that form with shoes on.Running with your heels first may also bad for your joints, muscles, and ligaments. It creates a highly unnatural ""V"" shape with your lower legs and feet that puts unnecessary strain on everything.

, You may think taking longer strides will mean a faster pace, but that is not true. After all, you can't move forward with your feet in the air.Taking shorter strides will actually speed you up more (if done correctly).









When you over-stride, you lose your form. Your front foot struts out in front of you and actually acts as a sort of brake on your entire body. You then have to carry yourself over your foot, leading to a bouncing that just isn't good for form or speed.
Keeping your stride normal also means you won't get winded as quickly.

, Just two degrees can mean the difference between a decent sprint and a great sprint.This doesn't mean throwing all your weight forward so it's a constant battle to avoid falling forward. Just a slight incline is sufficient to help you move faster without losing your balance.
It's also important not to lean back. Sometimes when nearing the finish line or checking to see those behind you, you may be tempted lean back or look up and change your form. This, too, slows you down. You can look around when your sprint is done.

, Your arms can help propel you if you move them in the right way. They should pump with your legs, driving you forward.








Think of making an ""L"" shape with your arm: your relaxed fists should reach as high as your chin and be drawn back with your elbows.

, You should never decelerate during a sprint. If you are moving less than your top speed, you lose valuable time.If you feel the need to slow down, concentrate on pushing through it. If this is a problem for you, start out a bit slower. Ideally, you'll finish faster than you started.









If you're running a race, starting out a bit behind can give you psychological momentum to speed up. Those that start out strong and wear themselves out sometimes think they have already won, and don't expect to be overtaken by those who paced themselves at the outset.

, At all times, you should be harmonizing your breathing with your strides.There is some disagreement as to whether it is more beneficial to breath through the nose or mouth, or whether it makes any difference at all. The crucial thing is to make sure you are getting enough oxygen, so try both and see what feels comfortable and works best for you.If you're not tired but your muscles are, try to inhale more deeply.It's probable that your muscles just need more oxygen.
In addition to working on your form and running ability, you should work on your breathing. Concentrate on it when you're warming up so you are primed to do it correctly and deeply during your sprint.

, It is very important to follow the kind of dietary guidelines that everyone could benefit from. Athletes, however, have additional dietary needs.


Carbohydrates are key, as these will release loads of energy and give you strength. Cereal, bread, pasta, and potatoes are all good examples.Additional protein is also necessary for muscle-building. Consider lean proteins such as turkey and cottage cheese.Champion sprinter Usain Bolt lives on a regimen of yams, pasta and rice, chicken and pork, and stays away from fast food.You will also require more calories over the course of a day than less active people. Make time for yourself to eat a healthy breakfast every day, especially if you are working out that day.If you have a run coming up, load up on the right foods beforehand. However, hold back on the power foods a few hours before a run. You don't want your stomach acting up during the race.

, All the exercise you'll be getting means you'll lose a lot of fluids through perspiration, so to stay hydrated, you'll need to drink lots of water.If you're training in the sun, it's even more important.A good rule of thumb is to replenish with a pint of water for every pound you lose after a workout. So, weigh yourself before and after to get an idea of how much you need to be drinking. A high school football player, for example might lose five pounds from perspiration after practice.

, Proper weightlifting, or strength training, while breathing correctly, is another important part of increasing your speed, and it should be incorporated into your schedule at least twice a week.weightlifting that really tests you (but is not so heavy that you shake or can't get started) is going to condition your muscles for sprinting by making them bigger and more able to endure soreness.
Every gym is different and the machines will vary. Be sure to look for ones that focus on working your legs.
Don't push yourself too hard, as this can lead to serious injury. Work up to the heavier weights slowly.
If you aren’t confident in your ability to jump right into weight-training at the gym, you can strength-train at home.

, The leg muscles are, of course, the key to running fast. Make use of a squat machine to strengthen your quad muscles. Do various exercises on this, such as jumping squats and lifts. There are also a number of barbell exercises that can strengthen your legs:








Do deadlifts. Find a long bar designed for handling lots of weight. Put some weight on it, squat down and pick it up. Then, stand up straight. Now, just bend over using your back and try to get the bar to touch your feet, while holding onto it. You should feel this in your hamstrings, the most important muscles for running.Try the ""power clean,"" a maneuver that involves squatting down to pick up a long barbell, and then standing up rapidly as you simultaneously life with your arm.Do barbell squats. Rest a long barbell across your shoulders, holding it in place with both hands. Then, in a wide stance, do squats, keeping your chin parallel to the ground., Working on your abdominal muscles takes a lot of time, but having a strong core will make everything easier, making it worth the effort. it can also help prevent injuries.One good exercise for your abs is to take hold of a weight bar (25 to 45 pounds) or hand weights, and then just do some sit-ups.Work on your lower abs, too. For a good lower-ab workout, find a pole, or something of the sort (for example, a leg support to a bench press machine, the railing of your bed, etc.), grip it very tightly, lie down, and do some leg-lifts. Keep your legs together and bring them up and down very slowly.You should feel burn in the bottom of your abs, so you know it's working.

, The shoulders are also important for a fast sprint. They give your body the drive it needs to run quickly,increasing both acceleration and control.If there is a shoulder press or a bench press at your gym, make sure to spend some time using it.









Bench presses also help your chest muscles, which are also important.
Be very careful when working around your shoulders and neck. Injuring this area can be extremely painful and put your workout routine on hold for quite a while, as you'll need time to recover.

, Not only is running uphill great for your lungs and your leg muscles, but it naturally improves your form too.You'll find yourself automatically going for the balls of your feet and leaning slightly forward.









Think of hill sprints as a mix between sprinting and weight-lifting. It burns a lot of calories and is great for building your calf muscles., While you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on clothes and shoes if you're just looking for a faster run, top-of-the-line running gear will be useful if you're going competitive (or setting world records).


Get shoes designed just for sprinters. You'll want a lightweight shoe that has sprint spikes. The less you're weighed down the better, and all that time you spend on the balls of your feet will be made easier with sprint spikes.
Wear the right clothes. Being comfortable is the key. You want your workout clothes to fit comfortably and keep your body the right temperature. Unless you really like the feel of them, however, you don't need to worry about buying lower-limb compression garments. Research suggests they don't do much to improve performance.Get some sprinting blocks. If you're really serious about sprinting, pick up a set of the blocks you've seen Olympic sprinters use to take off from. They help your propel yourself off the starting line.The nearest sporting goods store should have them.

, Whether you're on a track team or just racing with your friends, running with others is almost guaranteed to make you run faster. A little friendly competition is likely to help you get motivated.Whether it's on a row of treadmills or on a track, running with friends can give you a drive to be the best that's harder to find on your own. Seeing people in your periphery (or trying to zoom ahead of you) will keep you very literally on your toes.

, Sprinting truly is about how fast you're going and how long it takes you to get from point A to point B. To know if you're really getting better, you'll need to time yourself.


Odds are you probably want to get going on setting new personal records. However, only try this two or three times a day at most; once you've been at it for a while, you're performance will start to decline. You'll just get more frustrated as you get tired and find yourself unable to match your previous efforts.

Before you can increase your speed, it is important to time how fast you are currently running, so you can accurately measure your progress. Use a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to run a mile. Once you have an exact time - whether it's 8 minutes or 16 minutes - you can work on improving it!


This is where running on a track comes in handy, as each 400M lap of the track is equal to 1/4 of a mile, so four laps of the track is equal to one mile.
If you don't have access to a track, measure an exact mile on a stretch of flat, traffic-free road, then use that to time your run.
You should also try to measure the number of strides you take in a minute. You can do this by giving yourself a minute on the clock, then counting the number of times your right foot hits the ground as you run. Whatever number you come up with, you should try to double it as you increase your running speed.;
, Find a local track or flat surface of about 1/4 mile (400 meters) to run on. Tracks are an ideal place for beginner runners looking to increase their speed, as they are a standard length - 400 meters - which allows you to easily measure your progress. They are also traffic-free and flat.Local schools will often open up their tracks to the public, which is convenient if you don't have access to a track elsewhere.If you cannot conveniently make it to a track, you can also improve your running speed on a treadmill at the gym or on any flat road with minimal traffic.Avoid curved or uneven streets, as their shape will affect your running. For example, on a curved street the curb foot will be noticeably lower than the street-side foot.

, Increasing your running speed will require a lot of discipline and dedication, so it's important that you set yourself a challenging yet realistic schedule and stick to it. You should aim to be running at least 4 to 5 times a week, varying the length and intensity of your runs.


This will not only help you stay on track to running faster, it will also give you an opportunity to gather metrics: do you maintain a steady pace? Are you continuing to speed up, or have you reached a plateau?

, It is important to have a specific goal in mind as you are training to run faster. Having a goal will increase your motivation and force you to push yourself that little bit harder in order to attain it. Whatever goal you choose, it should be challenging but realistic.


You can set a goal which involves running a certain distance in a specific length of time - for example, your goal could be to run a mile in 8 minutes.
Alternatively, you could set yourself a goal which involves increasing the number of steps you take in a minute, or your cadence. The fastest runners in the world have an average cadence of around 180 steps per minute.
To find your ideal cadence goal, run for 60 seconds, counting the number of times your right foot hits the ground. Then double this number to find your target goal!


, The right running gear - shoes, clothes etc. - though not essential to increasing your running speed, can definitely help to make you feel lighter on your feet. There are a huge array of running shoes available nowadays, many with an emphasis on mimicking the feel and movement of barefoot running.


Lightweight, breathable clothing can also help you to feel cooler and less weighed down while running, both physically and mentally.
You may also want to invest in a high-tech watch that you can use to accurately time your runs, while also measuring distance, speed, calories burned and heart rate.

, Getting a friend involved in your new fitness plan can really help to up your motivation levels. Whether your friend intends to run with you, or act as your personal trainer, having some one else along for the ride will ensure that you don't quit and may even provide some healthy competition.

, If you're struggling to push yourself or stay motivated to attain a faster running speed, creating an inspirational mantra which you can repeat to yourself while running may be helpful. It can be as silly or a cliche as you like, as long as it's a simple phrase that motivates you to do better.


Think along the lines of ""you're too slow"" or ""gotta go fast"" - or anything you can think of really!


, To help boost both your speed and endurance, you need to push your limits and mix up your workout routines a little. If you've been doing the same exercises for a few months, your body will have settled into a routine, and it's likely you've reached a plateau. It's time to shake it up and try some new things!



Try running on the treadmill. Using a treadmill is a great way to train your body to run at a higher tempo. The belt will propel you forward while keeping you at a constant speed, thus encouraging a higher leg turnover. To get the most out of your treadmill workouts, set the machine to a speed slightly higher than you're comfortable with and push yourself to keep up. This will train your legs and muscles to work at a higher speed, even off the treadmill!Try spinning classes. Spinning classes can help to increase your cadence while running by encouraging your hips to rotate at higher speeds. Spinning classes will also help to get your overall fitness levels up, making them an excellent cross-training choice.

Try skipping. Using a jump rope increases cardiovascular fitness, encourages weight-loss and improves coordination, while also training your body to absorb your body weight when your feet impact the ground. Incorporating just 30 minutes of skipping into your weekly schedule can help to get your body in top running condition and promote faster feet.Try yoga. For a more low-key form of exercise that still helps to benefit your running, try working a yoga class or two into your weekly schedule. Yoga helps to improve flexibility, which benefits running form and decreases muscle recovery time - all good news for runners training hard to increase their speed.


, Maintaining good form while running will ensure that your body is operating as efficiently as possible, helping you to increase your running speed, as well as helping to prevent injuries. Running should feel natural and loose - you shouldn't feel tense or taut. Here are some tips on correct running posture, which will help you to maintain good form:


Keep your head up, with your eyes looking straight ahead. Avoid looking down at your shoes or tilting your chin up, as this will put your neck and back out of line.Keep your arms at a 90-degree angle and swing them back and forwards slightly, to propel your body forwards. Don't clench your fists, hunch your shoulders or hold your arms tightly against your body. If you feel yourself doing any of these things, shake your arms out to relieve any tension and resume the correct posture.Your hips should face straight ahead, in an upright position, aligning them with your torso and shoulders.The position of your legs will vary slightly depending on they style of running. Sprinters will need to lift their knees quite high in order to attain maximum speed. However, most runners, even if you're trying to run faster than your normal pace, do not need to lift their knees so high. To increase your speed, you should simply take a higher number of shorter strides, lifting your knees only slightly. Your foot should fall directly beneath your body.Your knees should be slightly flexed as your foot lands, so your leg can naturally bend on impact.Your foot should land on your heel and mid-foot, before rolling forward onto your toes to push off for your next step. Good, fast runners are light on their feet and have a bit of spring in their step., ""Fartlek"" is a Swedish word meaning ""speed play"" and is becoming a more and more popular training method amongst runners who are trying to increase their speed. Fartlek training involves varying your running pace at random intervals throughout your run. With fartleks, you can run at a jogging pace for several minutes then sprint for a full minute, before resuming your previous pace.Fartleks are a very flexible training method, and you can decide what the ratio of jogging to sprinting will be, depending on how you're feeling on a given day. For best results, you should aim to incorporate fartlek training into a 40-60 minute run.Most runners don't use very exact methods or timing for doing fartlek training. A lot of times, runners will simply decide to sprint until they get to a particular landmark, like a telephone pole or fire hydrant. The length of the sprint is entirely up to you and your body's ability.It is important to warm up properly - at least 10-15 minutes at an average running pace - before attempting a fartlek workout. This is because you need to ensure that your muscles are loose enough to handle the demands of multiple accelerations. Also ensure that you allow yourself a decent cooldown periods, otherwise you could be dealing with some very sore muscles the next day., Running over hilly terrain has been proven to gradually build up speed over time, so you should definitely incorporate some hill training into your workout schedule. Running uphill may be harder at first, but after a while of getting used to it, you will find it much easier to run on a level surface, and you'll run at a faster speed.Hill runs are actually better for your body too, as they help you to achieve high intensities while limiting the joint shock caused by pounding on flat surfaces.To really get the intensity level up, you can try doing some hill sprints. This involves running up a fairly steep hill for 30 to 60 seconds, at the maximum speed that you can physically maintain for that length of time., Getting the most out of your breathing can help to increase both your running speed and your overall stamina. This is because breathing deeply allows more oxygen into your bloodstream, which gives muscles more energy to keep going. You should inhale and exhale using both your mouth and nose, and aim to breathe into your belly rather than into your chest.


Belly-breathing involves drawing deeper breaths, which, if done correctly, should inflate your stomach like a balloon when you breathe in, and deflate it when you breathe out. When you breathe into your chest, as most inexperienced runners do, you tend to breathe less deeply (limiting your oxygen intake) and hunch up your shoulders (wasting precious energy).While running, try to time your breathes to the rhythm of your footfall. This helps to strengthen the diaphragm. To begin, take one breath in for every two steps (right, left), then exhale for the next two steps. Once your diaphragm grows stronger and your breathing deepens, you can extend this to one breath for every four steps., Something as simple as looking straight ahead while running can actually increase your running speed. Some runners have a tendency to look down at their feet or to look around them, taking in their surroundings, during their run. While this is fine for people who are running for pleasure or just to enjoy the great outdoors, runners training for speed should aim to focus their gaze about 20 to 30 meters in front of them, always looking straight ahead.


This is particularly useful advice for runners interested in racing - as it helps them to keep their eyes on the finish line!

, Being fit does not necessarily mean that you are at your ideal weight, especially if you are eating large meals to compensate for an intense workout schedule. It is important to understand that the more extra weight you're carrying, the more effort it will require to complete your run. It might be as little as one pound or as much as ten, but losing the extra weight can help you to run faster for longer.Of course, crash dieting is not an option for people on intense running schedules. However, it is completely possible to stay full and satisfied on a healthy, nutritionally balanced diet. In fact, changing your eating habits may allow you to lose weight and provide you with the extra energy necessary to run that little bit faster.To lose weight healthily, try increasing your intake of protein-rich lean meats, such as chicken, turkey and oily fish, and combine them with small portions healthy carbohydrates such as brown rice, multi-grain bread, or wholewheat pasta. Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables along with every meal, to increase feelings of fullness with loading on the calories. For healthy yet filling snacks on the go, reach for a banana, a low-fat yogurt or a handful of almonds or raisins., Although some running purists disdain the need for music while running, studies have proven that people who listen to music as they exercise show a significant increase in their power output, particularly when listening to high-tempo music.Try to find a selection of songs with a tempo that matches to running speed you are trying to achieve. While listening to these songs, your body will naturally fall into step with the music and your speed will increase without you even realizing it!

, Keeping a log of your workouts is a great way to track your progress and give you some added motivation to keep going when you need it. After every run, take note of your time, your average speed, the route you took, the weather conditions and how you felt physically throughout the run. Such detailed notes will help you to track how certain conditions affect your time and speed.


If you make a note that your knee has been acting up for several runs in a row, you'll know when it's time to take a rest day and you can fend off potential injuries.
You will also be able to easily see from your notes when your training program is becoming repetitive and realize when it's time to mix things up and try a new running route or speed training exercise.

, Running fast isn't just about exercising more. You will want to make this a ""whole body"" experience by maintaining a proper diet, hydrating, and keeping your entire mind and body fit. A healthy diet is essential for runners, as intense, high-energy workouts can take their toll on your body. It is vital that you replace the calories you burn during a workout with healthy, vitamin- and nutrient-rich foods, which help you stay in peak condition and perform to the best of your ability.


You should eat plenty of animal products like chicken, lean beef, eggs and dairy products such as milk and yogurt. These foods contain high-levels of protein, which is an essential energy source for runners, as well as lots of iron and zinc, which support the production of red blood cells and protect the immune system. Calcium from the dairy products also promotes strong bones.
You should eat whole-grain cereals with added protein for breakfast. These will set you up for the day and help you feel fuller for longer. The healthy carbohydrates will also give you energy, making whole-grain cereal bars a great choice for an energy-boost before, during and after a run. Small portions of whole-grain rice and pasta (rather than their white counterparts, which are void of nutrients) are also a good mealtime accompaniment to lean meat and veggies, making dinnertime healthy, tasty and satisfying - a much sought-after combination!Try to get five portions of fruit and veg a day. Fruit and vegetables are packed with vitamins, nutrients and good carbohydrates, which help keep you full throughout the day, without piling on the calories. Don't peel the fruit and veg, however, as the skins are the most nutritious part! You should also try to vary the colors of the fruit and veg you eat, as the vibrant colors of different fruits and vegetables actually result from the various, healthful, antioxidant pigments they contain. For example, tomatoes get their color from lycopene, while sweet potatoes contain the beta-carotene that makes them orange!

, It is essential that runners stay hydrated, both during their runs and in between, as dehydration can lower the supply of oxygen to your muscles, causing you to run slower. However, contrary to popular belief, drinking eight glasses of water a day may not be the best way forward, and may even cause over-hydration, which can be dangerous in extreme circumstances. To find out how much water you should be drinking a day, follow the formulas below:



Men: Men should multiply their body weight (in pounds) by .35 fluid oz. in order to find out their optimum fluid intake per day, though runners should drink a little extra to cover fluid loss due to sweating.

Women: Women should multiply their body weight (in pounds) by .31 fluid oz. to get their optimum daily fluid intake, though runners should drink a little extra to cover fluid loss due to sweating.
If you bring a sports bottle with you to drink water while you run, don't feel as if you need to be chugging away at it constantly. Current research recommends that you should drink when you're thirsty - no more, no less., Junk food and candy may give you an instant energy boost, due to their high levels of sugar and fat, but that boost will rapidly be followed by a crash, leaving you feeling slow and sluggish. Stick with natural sources of sugar and fats for the same boost, without the negative side effects.


If you're really craving something sweet, go for a banana, which is full of natural sugars but will keep you feeling full and energized for much longer than a bar of chocolate.
If you're craving fats, eat a tablespoon of peanut butter, on its own or spread on some wholegrain toast.

, Conventional wisdom would hold that drinking coffee before running is a major no-no, as coffee is a diuretic which increases the risk of dehydration. However, studies have shown that consuming a cup of coffee - or other caffeinated drinks - prior to running can actually give runners an extra burst of speed. This is great news for coffee addicts, but just remember to keep everything in moderation.

, In addition to eating well, staying hydrated and training effectively, you also need to make sure that your body is getting the rest and recovery time it needs to perform well. Pushing your body too hard can result in exhaustion and injury, which may put you out of the game for some time.


To prevent this from happening, make sure that you give yourself one or two rest days a week, where you don't run at all. If you like, you can perform another type of low-intensity exercise such as walking or yoga on such rest days.
You should also ensure that you're getting enough good quality sleep at night, as studies have shown that athletes with healthy and consistent sleeping patterns tend to have quicker reaction times and faster race finishes.

, Stretches are a great way to increase flexibility, improve performance and reduce the risk of injury while running. Rather than traditional static stretches (stretch and hold), dynamic stretches (which incorporate movement) have been proven to be more beneficial for runners and other athletes alike, as they stretch your body in a more dynamic, functional way., Swing one leg out to the side as far as you can swing it, and then swing it back across your body in front of your standing leg, as far as possible. Repeat this stretch ten times on each leg.

, Keep your back and knees straight, and walking forward, lift your legs straight out in front in an exaggerated march, and flex your toes towards you. Too easy? Add a skipping motion. Do ten reps with each leg.

, Kick your own butt? You bet! While standing, walk forward, and swing your legs back and up, trying to kick yourself in the glutes. If this gets to be too easy, do it while jogging. Do ten reps with each leg.

, Step forward using a long stride, and keeping the front knee over or just behind your toes, lower your body by dropping your back knee toward the ground. Walk using that movement. Maintain an upright posture throughout the stretch, and keep your abs tight for maximum benefit. Once again, do ten reps on each leg.

, Get in a ""pike"" position with your butt in the air. Put your right foot behind your left ankle. Keeping your legs straight, press the heel of the left foot down, and then release. Repeat ten times on each leg.

, Lift your left leg up like you're kicking a hacky sack, bending at the knee so it points out. Tap the inside of your left foot with your right hand without bending forward. Repeat ten times on each leg.

, The plank exercise is a great way to build your endurance and strengthen both your abs and your back. To do a plank: Lie face down, your hands flat on the ground at head level. Lift up off the ground, on your toes, and resting on your elbows with your hands flat. Your back should form a straight line from head to foot. Tighten your core so your butt doesn't stick up or sag. Hold for one minute, then ease back down. Do 15 reps.


Add a leg swing: to get more out of your planks, put your legs in motion, one at a time: Lift one leg up so it's roughly parallel to the ground, swing it outward (keeping it parallel), then return to the starting position, and do the other leg.

, This companionship and mild form of competition can be an excellent source of motivation to keep going. It's also an opportunity to test each other.

, For example, if you say you are too tired or bored, have your buddy counter your excuses. In turn, encourage your running partner. Make a pact to do everything to motivate each other.

, Try exercising every day as a daily routine

, Just in case your friend or family member doesn't want to run with you, see if you can convince this person to at least come with you with a bike. It can be a good way to get exercise for both of you without your pal having to get totally worn out.

In other words, don't bite off more than you can chew. If you start running with no prior exercise habits, you'll probably end up hurting yourself and quitting before you ever really started.









The simplest thing to do would be to start walking. But it can be anything -- as long as you're getting physically active on a regular basis, your body will be able to handle the impending pavement pounding. Go hiking, swimming, or dancing. If it's fun, all the better!

, Research says that barefoot running leads to far fewer injuries than running in running shoes, even the fanciest ones.However, you're probably not going to be running barefoot anywhere, unless it's after chasing a kid or a meatball that rolled away unexpectedly. So look for a shoe that can simulate running barefoot. If you're willing to rock those toe shoes (Vibrams), more power to you, but there are many minimalist running shoes that do not have toe sleeves.

, The last thing you want are shin splints, a pulled hamstring, or some other injury that can be avoided. Take five or ten minutes before your run to warm up. However, this does not mean stretching. In fact, stretching beforehand can hurt you!








Instead, warm up your muscles by doing deadlifts, donkey kicks, lunges, and other similar exercises that stretch your muscles, but also get them working. Save the stretching for after the run.

, Make sure your body is fluid and relaxed, but not hunched over. Try to keep your shoulders and arms loose while keeping your back straight.









Keep your head and neck relaxed, too. Holding tension there extends down through your spine and the rest of your body, which can actually tire you out well before you would be otherwise., What matters most is that you breathe with a rhythm that provides a consistent supply of oxygen to your body. Instead of being a chest-breather, be a belly-breather. Make a conscious effort to fill up your stomach, using your diaphragm. You'll get more oxygen and your muscles (heart included) will be less tired.








Don't worry about whether you are breathing through the nose or the mouth. Some runners find that breathing through their mouth gets them the most oxygen, while others find that breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth works best. Find whatever seems efficient to you.If you're running at a medium pace, you should be able to carry on a simple conversation with a running partner without much difficulty. If you cannot, you are running too fast to go very far in most cases.

, Keep your head in a neutral position, not looking up or down. Look approximately 35 feet in front of you if you're running a distance of more than 400 meters.If you're on a treadmill, try not to look down at your feet or the controls too much; it puts tension on your back., Keep your elbows at around a 90 degree angle, close to your body. Use a 110 degree angle for long-distance (except when you are working up a hill). Swing each arm forward and backward in time with the opposite leg; this provides momentum and prevents your body from twisting.









The motion should come from the elbows, not your forearms. Be sure you are not swaying your arms diagonally in front of you. You want your arms to be going straight down and back up.
Do not tense your fists. Imagine that you have two fragile items in each of your hands and if you tense too hard, you will break them.
Don't let your hands cross the midline of your torso, or you'll create a twisting motion., Act like you've got a rope tied across your waist and someone is pulling you gently forward with it. Avoid side-to-side movement or twisting.








, Aim to hit the ground about 185 times per minute. The simplest way to do this is to minimize the time your feet are on the ground. Whether you're in a light jog or running from a crowd it is up to you -- just don't go so hard you hurt yourself!









Do what's comfortable. If you can't run an 8-minute mile, don't be hard on yourself. It'll come with time. The fact that you're out there and running is great! Simply aim to improve a little bit every time you pound the pavement.

, Have your feet land under you as you run.Try mimicking it when you go for your real runs at the gym or on the trail.


If you're sprinting, you want to stay on your toes as much as is humanly possible. The more you barely touch the ground, the more you'll practically be flying. However, even if you're running long distances, it's best to stay off your heels. When you land with the back of your foot, the angle you create from foot to calf (you're forming an unnatural ""V"" shape) can lead to injury.

, Before ending your workout, slowly taper your run down to a jog, and your jog down to a walk, over the course of about 5 minutes. This allows your circulation and breathing to normalize after your run, minimizing the work your heart has to do.










Now it's time for stretching. Concentrate on your calves, glutes, and hamstrings since those are the ones that worked the hardest. It's incredibly important to stretch after running because during, the muscles have a tendency to tighten up. Stretching them out relaxes them and returns them to normal. How you need them tomorrow!

, If you're running around a track, do one lap at a walk and another at a jog. You're sort of easing your mind and body into the oncoming sprints.









Just like in the previous section, don't stretch now -- stretch later. Warm up your core muscles and your legs not by stretching but with core exercises like lunges and deadlifts.

, The length of your sprint is up to you -- do you want to do it by distance or time? If you're aiming for interval training (which is a great idea), keep it to about 30 seconds.


Interval training seems to be where it's at. If you're looking for a quick way to blast away calories with the strength of a zillion lightsabers or if you're just low on time, this is the workout for you. All you do is run SUPER FAST for about 30 seconds, slow down for a minute, and repeat. Continue the cycle for about 15 minutes, adjusting as you need to.And then ta da! Finished. Lunch break over.

, There are two ways here to run faster: using your core and using your arms. You can use your own body to your advantage when it comes to getting that faster time.









You'll find that leaning a bit forward propels your body to run faster to balance your weight. This is helpful when running uphill, but can lead to injury otherwise. Take this piece of advice with a grain of salt.In addition to placing your core forward, use your arms for momentum. Keep them in a straight line, mirroring the movement of your legs. Keep them loose and not hunched up to your shoulders -- ow., After your sprints, cool down for a moment and walk. This allows you to normalize your oxygen levels again and prepare for the next sprint.









If you experience pain, stop. It's your body telling you it should not be doing what you're making it do. It's better to stop now to be okay later than to not stop now and not be okay later.

, If you need water between sprints, take small sips. Don't guzzle or gulp, even if it's tempting; consuming too much water in the middle of a run can lead to cramps.


That being said, it's very important to stay hydrated. If you're not, you may experience dizziness or even fainting. If you don't drink water during your run, make sure to drink it before and after.

, Gently work your muscles after your sprints to reduce cramping and shin splints. Do light versions of the exercises you did to warm up in addition to stretching.









Walk around the area or for another minute or so on the treadmill. Your heart works to speed your body up and slow it down, so going from 60 to 0 is just as hard on it as going 0 to 60. You're probably running to be healthy, so it's best to do it right!

, Make sure your running shoes fit your feet as close as they can without being too tight. You don't want to be distracted by blisters in the middle of your run. The longer you run, the better your shoes need to be.


If you run every day, your shoes will only last 4-6 months. If your feet all of a sudden begin hurting, it's high time to get a new pair.
There are shoe stores that can design shoes for your feet. If you can afford it, consider getting shoes that match your arch and shape.

, If you're going for a 10k or more, it's wise to load up on carbs a day or two before. But you've got to do it right! You don't want too much fiber, protein, or fat. And it needs to be easily digestible to avoid risk of nausea during the race!


Tortillas, oatmeal, bread, pancakes, waffles, bagels, yogurt, and juice are all good, high-carb, easy-to-digest options. Fruit has carbs, too, but many are high-fiber, so peel the skin beforehand.Don't feel guilty -- you'll definitely burn the calories later.
A phenomenon many serious runners have made a habit of is pounding energy goo (or Gu, if you want to go brand-name). It's basically sugar and carbs in goo form, though you can get some that's chewable. It replenishes your glucose levels and will give you a burst about 20 minutes after consuming it. Many swear by it!Try out the goo while you're still training. You don't want stomach troubles during a long race!



, Run at a conversational pace or a little slower for 10 minutes and a quicker pace for 5. Then follow it with drills. (High knees, Butt kicks, skipping) This will get your circulation going without expending too much energy prematurely. It's all about getting primed and having your heart rate begin to rise.









Do some core exercises, too. Regardless of whether you're sprinting or running long distances, the importance of warming up remains the same.

, At the beginning of a long run, you'll be ready and raring to go. You'll start off like a bat out of hell...and then tire really quickly. Instead of running all out (like you would in a sprint), run at a pace you can keep steady. You'll last much, much longer.









You probably know what you're capable of. As long as you're training, if you find yourself slowly getting capable of more and more, you're doing it right. Each person has their own level of expectation and improvement. Know what yours is and aim for it.

, When you're tired, try focusing on another goal, such as another half mile, or think of something to treat yourself with once you finish.


For beginning runners, a common goal is running for around 10 minute mile pace. If time is a factor you're considering, try timing your miles or kilometers and aiming for a specific, timed goal.

, It's of utmost importance that you stay hydrated during a long run. If it is longer than 50 minutes on a hot day, have a water stop. However, if you take water with you on your run, only drink small sips. Guzzling water in the middle of a run will lead to cramps. And it may make you need to pee!


Keep your water cold, if you can. The colder it is, the faster it will get absorbed into your system.Since you're sweating so much, staying hydrated is key!

, At the end of your run, downshift to a jog, then a walk. Your heart rate should be close to resting speed by the time you stop. Stopping like you hit a brick wall will put your heart and muscles on high alert, jarring them. That's the kind of activity that leads to injury! Do not let this become a part of the workout however. If you are on a 30 minute run, do a 30 minute run, and then, and only then, the cool down.









And the next time you go running, aim for a bit longer or a bit faster!

, Technically, to run, you could eat whatever the heck you like. However, it's gonna be a lot easier to run and feel good during and after if you're loading up on healthy stuff beforehand. A good way to think about it would be to eat like a caveman -- going as au natural as possible.


If it's processed, do your best to avoid it. Fruits and veggies should make up a large portion of your diet, with some lean meat, low-fat dairy, and whole grains thrown in.If you want to see changes in your body, this step is a must-do.

, Straight up, running doesn't do wonders for toning your body, at least your upper body. It's a great way to lose weight and burn fat -- but unfortunately, it can burn muscle, too. If you just run, you may end up with that ""skinny-fat"" look.It doesn't have to be much and it doesn't have to be in the gym. Simply doing core workouts (like planks, etc.) can tone your upper bits. Stick to a couple times a week -- your muscles need time to heal themselves after getting ripped, torn, and creating new fibers.

, Getting started running is a lot about not getting discouraged too soon. If you think it's too difficult or not enjoyable enough, you won't stick with it. If you're hitting the gym, find a gym that's convenient to get to and that has nice equipment. TV, anyone?


If you're running outside, consider terrain, scenery, and level. Are you running on dirt, gravel, or blacktop? Is it pretty enough to keep you relaxed and in the zone? Is there plenty of flat terrain, or is it uphill or downhill?

, All you really need to run is a good pair of shoes. If the budget doesn't allow for the fancy, technical gear, don't sweat it. You don't need any. Women should have a decent sports bra, but that's about it. CoolMax or Dri-Fit are two brands of synthetic fabrics that keep the moisture (read: sweat) off your skin if you're interested, but you can run just as well as long as you're comfortable.

, Odds are your area has a running, triathlon, or marathon club you can join. Being surrounding by like-minded people will only fill you with more gusto -- and it'll keep you on track when you're feeling less than motivated. Need a buddy to run a race with? Problem solved.


Don't know where to find one? Try your local running shoe shop. It's probably a smaller network of serious runners than you realize! Soon you'll be on a first name basis.

, Now that you're a runner, might as well do some good with your new hobby! There are millions of 5 and 10ks out there to support good causes. With two minutes of research, you're bound to find one in your area!

Set up a safe practice area.,
Warm up.,
Familiarize yourself with the approach.,
Jump at the wall from about a pace away.,
Meet the wall with your foot and drive downward.,
Scurry up the wall.,
Pull yourself up the wall and dismount.",How to Run Up and Over a Wall1," Running up and over a wall is a moderately difficult move that is relatively safe when practiced slowly in a controlled environment. Walls that are very high or surrounded by hard ground, like cement, will be much more dangerous than moderate to small walls surrounded by soft dirt or grass.


Once you have mastered the wall run, you can apply this skill to nearly any wall you choose. However, when getting started, smaller walls approximately 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) (1.8 to 2.1 m) will be safest.
Sneakers or athletic shoes that fit snugly, aren't constricting, and have good grip on the bottom sole will help you run up and over walls more safely and easily.
If safety is a major concern for you, the safest way to learn this move will be with a professional instructor, like a parkour trainer.;
, To perform this move you'll mostly be using your legs and core, so these areas should be given extra attention when warming up. You'll also have to approach the wall at a moderate to fast speed when going up and over, so you might want to take a quick jog or run, too.


Warm up your joints to improve performance and prevent injury. Start from your head and work your way down your body, rotating each joint back and forth. Make your rotations as wide ranging as possible.
Perform some dynamic stretches doing things like lunges, bending and touching your toes, and pulling your knee to your chest., Run at a wall at a slow to moderate pace. You'll want to be moving slow enough that you can easily gauge which foot will come in contact with the wall first. As you become more familiar with the motions of the approach, you should increase your speed.Run at the wall several times in this fashion. You may want to keep your hands raised in front of you as a brace or guide, especially with smooth walls, where slipping is a concern.
Avoid favoring a foot in your approach. Even if you find it most natural to end on your right foot before your left comes in contact with the wall, or vice versa, alternate between feet in your approach. This way, you'll be able to adapt to new environments more easily., When you are about a step away from the wall, raise your leg to prepare your foot for contact with the wall. Your wall-foot should be raised to roughly the max height of a normal step, or slightly higher. It should be positioned so that only the front third of the foot, not the entire foot, comes in contact with the wall.Keep your head up at this point in your wall run. It'll be natural reflex to watch your feet hit the wall, but this could result in you missing the top edge or dangerous hazards, like branches from trees or loose stones.

, For the best vertical distance, you'll want your foot to come in contact with the wall from the ball of your foot to your toes. In this instant, grip the wall with your foot and drive downwards. This will change your forward momentum upward, helping you to run up the wall.If your foot strikes the wall loudly when you come in contact with it, this is likely a sign that you are driving into and away from the wall, not downward and up the wall.If less of your foot is in contact with the wall, the force of your push might be directed outward away from the wall instead of upward, or you may not have enough grip to change direction.
Since the shift in your momentum from forward to upward comes from driving downward with your wall-foot, try not to connect with the wall too high. High contact points will make it difficult to generate enough force to run up the wall., You might only be able to run a single step up the wall, especially when you're first learning. Depending on your reflexes, strength, and skill, you may be able to take another step or two up the wall. If you can, do so in the same fashion as your leading foot.In some situations, you may come into your wall run with too much speed. Having your hands in front of you at this point can save you from accidentally slamming into it and injuring yourself.
Be ready to grab onto the top of the wall. Things will be moving very quickly. Being prepared will prevent you from missing your chance to grab hold.
Although some experts can get several steps in when running up and over a wall, allowing them to go even higher, you should only attempt a single step at first. As you become more comfortable with the motion, you can add more steps., If you've connected with the wall correctly, much of your momentum will now be redirected upwards. Even so, you'll have to use your arms to assist your upward momentum to pull yourself to the top of the wall. Then, carefully jump down or lower yourself to the other side.


Failing to assist your upward momentum can cause your jump to ""stall,"" which is another way of saying your momentum has run out. It can be difficult pulling yourself up from a stalled position.Treat jumping from high places seriously. Falling or jumping incorrectly from as few as 10 feet, a reasonable height for a medium sized wall, can cause injury."

Start with thirty minutes of barefoot activity a day for 3-4 weeks.This will give your feet a chance to develop thicker skin for running at higher speeds and for longer times.,
Make minimalist running shoes if it's cold outside, or you're concerned about your feet getting cut, but really it is best if you don't have to use these minimalist shoes.,
Watch ahead, but don't look down.,
Pay attention to your form.,
Take shorter strides.,
Lift your feet more quickly, and earlier than regular running.,
Don't stop abruptly, the way most do when they are wearing shoes.",How to Start Barefoot Running," Start by just walking, then jogging, then running, but limit the activity to thirty minutes a day at first. If you transition too quickly, you may develop plantar fasciitis.Walk for a few minutes to allow your feet to get familiar with the surface. Tarmac and concrete roads work well. Grass - unless finely manicured - does not work well as the surface can be uneven with clumps and roots.
Bounce on your feet like a boxer. Repeat 3 times. This will relax your metatarsals and calves.
Exercising your ankles and feet will help with the transition as well. See How to Strengthen Your Ankles
;
, They are basically reinforced socks and you'll lose many of the sensations of barefoot running. You can also purchase minimalist running shoes that look much like gloves for your feet. They're not the same as ultralight running shoes, which have arch support and a padded heel., One of the most common doubts people have about barefoot running is ""What about stepping on sharp stuff?"" and the most common answer is ""Use your eyes. That's what they're for.""


Scan the ground ahead of you for any sharp objects that you should avoid, but don't look down at the ground right in front of your feet. Not only is that bad form, but it doesn't give you enough time to smoothly avoid stepping on something.
Even if you're wearing minimalist running shoes, you should still be aware of where your feet are going. Don't zone out like you do when wearing shoes. Practice mindfulness.


,


Keep the head, neck and back straight. No slouching. Lift the chest and allow the shoulders to relax.
Keep your head high and keep looking forward. Relax your eye gaze to the horizon line. If you can't relax your eye gaze, then pick something in the distance to focus on and keep looking at it.
Bend your knees a bit. You should feel your weight come off of your heels. Bend the knees about 4-5 degrees, and lean forward 4-5 degrees. Keep the knees bent as much as you can. This will minimize the possibility of landing heel first.
Push your hips forward gently. You should lead with your hips, not your head or shoulders.
Counterbalance. Keep your hips rotating with your legs, and your shoulders in the opposite direction.
Keep your feet under your center of balance. No wobbling side to side.

, When people wear shoes with thick heels, they tend to lengthen their strides and land on their heels. When you're barefoot, however, you'll probably find yourself naturally taking smaller strides, and landing on the outside middle or ball of your foot. This allows your foot to absorb shock better., You should be lifting your back foot before the front foot completely lands.

, To stop, straighten the lean and straighten the knees and you will naturally come to a stop.

Choose the best shoes for where you'll run. Road shoes for the road, trail shoes for rougher terrain: this will keep your feet protected and help with traction.
Account for your arches. You'll need more or less support, depending on how high of an arch you have. The shape of the shoe itself will also need to change. Go to your local major shoe store to get help with this.
Check your heel movement. Some people roll their heels, either out or in, as they run. This will also affect the type of shoe you need. Check some old shoes for wear to get an idea of how you move.
Tie your shoes correctly. Did you know you can lace your shoes differently to make them fit better? There are methods to create more space in the toes, or support high arches. Even ways to keep heels in place if they tend to slip!Get the right size! Correct fit is key in making sure your shoes are as comfortable as possible. Even if you think you know what size you are, be willing to be wrong because it can make a huge difference in how you feel afterwards.;
,


Shoot for good movement. You should be choosing clothes that are loose or flexible, so that they allow for a good range of movement. You'll also want clothes in shapes and materials that breathe well. This can help reduce rashes and other skin problems.
Factor in weather and temperature. You'll probably need more than one jogging outfit (depending on where you live). Have clothes that are warmer and provide more coverage for if you go running in the winter, for example.
Don't forget about pockets. You'll want pockets in order to carry important things like your ID and your keys. Alternatively, though, you can use other things like your shoes or an armband.
You'll also want to wear the right kind of socks. Look for socks specifically marketed for runners. This can help prevent blisters.

,


Get an mp3 player. Smaller players, like an iPod nano, are great for using while you're jogging. There are even several wristbands that they can be fit into.
Find something to listen to. Music is the obvious choice, but you could even get something like a podcast or audio book too. This can be a great way to stay in touch with the news or fit in some ""reading"" if you're low on time.
Enjoy the quiet if you prefer: you don't have to listen to anything if you don't want to!
Stay safe! If you do choose to listen to something, try to only have one ear bud in. Hearing an approaching car or other sign of trouble is crucial to your safety.

,


Be careful where you run. Choose locations that are safe, with lots of people around and as few cars as possible.
Choose a good time to run. Running at night or in the morning, before dawn, is much more dangerous than running during the day. You run the risk of getting hit by a driver that can't see you or someone taking advantage of you when fewer people are around.
Stay visible to drivers. If you do decide to run near a road, stay visible by wearing bright, reflective clothing. You can also get safety devices, like a blinking LED, to get even more attention.
Jog with a buddy. Whether jogging with a person or even just a dog, this is significantly safer. This will help keep you safe from people who may want to take advantage of you!

,


Do a test run. Do a basic jog and see how it makes you feel. Test how far you can get before you feel super gross. By setting realistic expectations, you'll be much more likely to succeed.
Don't forget about getting back to your starting point. Factor in how long it takes you to run and leave in time to get back to your starting point. Yes, you may be able to get to that coffee shop down the road, but what about getting back?
Slowly increase your distance over time. Remember, you'll be able to jog a greater distance once you're in better shape and can move father, faster. Work your way up to it. Increasing will also give your body a better workout, so keep a longer route in mind.

,


Use mapping software. You can use free tools like Google Maps or RunningMap.com to measure the distance of your route and track things like elevation changes. Some websites even have a social aspect, allowing you and other runners in your area to share and compare routes.
Account for terrain. Changes in road types, terrain changes, and elevation changes can be a bigger hurdle than you give them credit for. Try to avoid things like having a steep hill right at the end of your run. You'll increase the chances of hurting yourself.
Test it out. Once you think you've got a good route in mind, test it out before making up your mind. You can even choose a few different routes to cycle between during the week.

,


Take things slow. Work your way up to serious exercise. Doing otherwise can just result in injury!
Don't go crazy with the exercise routine. Don't let it become an obsession. This isn't healthy. There is such a thing as too skinny and working out too much can leave you injured.
You also shouldn't push yourself too hard in a given workout. Some pushing is good. Getting yourself sent to the hospital is not. Look for signs from your body that enough is enough.

,


You do not want to jog on a full stomach: this can make you weak or even sick!
Have a small meal before jogging: something which will give you energy and won't weigh you down. A banana and a couple of sticks of jerky are a good option, as both will help your body fill up on the nutrients lost through exercise.
Don't forget to hydrate yourself too!

,


Don't stretch. At least, not before you start moving around. This actually increases your chances of hurting yourself! Do dynamic stretches if you stretch at all before jogging.
Warm up by walking briskly for a few minutes before jogging and then jogging slowly for a few minutes. After this, you can jog as normal.,


Keep your muscles loose and your movements natural. Being tense or pushing yourself too hard can result in injury.
Keep your shoulders down and loose.
Your torso should be straight and upright and your hips should be facing forward: in other words, your body should be in a natural position.

,


Don't forget to breathe!
Breathe deeply and evenly.
If you get lightheaded, stop! Give your self some rest and air.
If you find you have trouble breathing, consult with a doctor. You may have asthma.

,


Bring a water bottle with you or drink a lot before and after jogging.
Drink normal water and eat foods which provide potassium and sugar and salt (electrolytes) or drink something with electrolytes added in.
Your body loses these vital nutrients when it sweats, so replacing them is important. If you don't, you'll probably end up feeling sick.

, This is bad for your knees. Instead, try to hit the ground with the flat of your foot or, ideally, on the front/balls of your feet.
Bend your arms at a 90° angle.
Keep your head straight. Don't look down any more than you have to. You should generally be looking several feet in front of you at least.

,


Cool down to avoid injury. This step should not be skipped!
Jog slowly and then walk for a few minutes before stopping.
Finish your cool down with some stretching. Stretches that focus on the calves are the best for joggers.

,


Waking up an extra 30-45 minutes early can be one way to fit a jog into your day.
Jogging in the morning will kickstart your metabolism and give you more energy to get through your day. It's as effective as a cup of coffee for waking you up!
This allows you to also shower as normal, cutting out the extra time that takes if you do it later in your day.

,


If you're just not a morning person, you can fit your jog in at the end of your day as well. Either right when you get home or after dinner, it can be easier to fit in to your schedule.
This has the added benefit of working off some of your dinner calories, but the downside of making you less tired before bedtime.

,


If you have a long lunch break and access to a shower, you can use some of your lunch break to fit in a quick jog.
This actually works to keep you more alert during that dreaded second half of the day.
This also eliminates the time barrier that many people have, allowing you to make exercise a priority in your life.

,


If you work or go to school fairly close (3 miles (4.8 km) or less) to where you live, you can get yourself there by jogging.
Of course, you'll need a place to clean up once you're there. Bring a change of clothes and get rid of the stink before you settle in for the day!

,


Don't forget that you can also run on treadmills or indoor tracks, in the event of inclement weather.
You can also get exercise in other ways, if you can't, for some reason, jog that day. If, for example, you hurt your leg, you may still be able to do some upper-body exercises.

,


You should jog because you enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, you'll find it's almost impossible to keep motivated.
Jogging is actually only one of a number of basic exercises. There are others which can be more efficient or are easier to fit into your day.
If you're jogging mainly to lose weight, recognize that a combination of diet and simply being more active during the day (take the stairs, not the elevator) can be enough for many people.

,


Don't give yourself an excuse not to exercise. Remove as many possible excuses are you can by keeping your chosen routine convenient.
Choose a route close to home which isn't weather dependent.
Find a good time in your day to fit it in...one that isn't subject to constant change.

,


Taking someone with you can help keep you motivated, by making you responsible to someone else. This can be a close friend or a family member.
You can even take your dog, if you have one.
This has the added benefit of keeping you safe while you run.
You can also join a local runner's group. Many neighborhoods will do a jogging group. Check with yours!

,


Stay regular in your schedule. Exercise on the same days each week and at the same times on those days.
It helps if the rest of your life is also carefully scheduled.
Scheduling helps you build a rhythm and habit, and humans really are creatures of habit.

,


Avoid giving yourself incentives like extra sweets or new material objects. These work poorly to motivate you and can work against your goals. Instead, make jogging fun by turning it into a game.
Did you know that there are apps for your phone that turn exercising into a video game? Apps like ""Zombies, run!"" are a great way to make your workout fun and something to look forward to.

,


Setting goals will give you something to work toward. A tangible end-point will help you feel like you're making progress. What this endpoint is is up to you, however.
You can say that you want to lose a certain amount of weight. You can decide to jog a certain distance. You can make it a goal to be fit enough to run a local marathon. There are all sorts of goals.
Another good goal would be building up the ability to run a local race in a year's time. You can race for charity or even just for fun!

,


Jog for 1 minute, then walk for 1 minute. Then increase the time for each by one minute. Continue increasing and alternating until you jog for 5 minutes and walk for 5 minutes. Do this 3-5 times during the week.

,


Jog for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 minutes, with 1 minute of walking in between each stretch. Do this 3-5 times during the week.

,


Jog for 5 minutes, walk for 1 minute, jog for 10 minutes, then walk for 1 minute, jog for 15 minutes, then walk for 1 minute. Do this 3-5 times during the week.

,

Allow yourself time to acclimate to the motion.,
Set and achieve wall run goals.,
Attempt running up and over different kinds of walls.,
Train yourself physically.,
Join a parkour group.",How to Run Up and Over a Wall2," Humans rarely naturally experience the rapid shift in momentum necessary to run up and over walls. Due to this, the motion will likely feel foreign to you for some time. Focus on clean, smooth, and consistent technique, until the motions become second nature.


You may find that your early attempts end in you kicking off and away from the wall instead of running up and over it. This is completely natural, and will still help you become familiar with this move's mechanics., This kind of practice works well with tall walls. Using tape and a ladder, mark off several heights at regular intervals along the face of the wall. These will be your targets while practicing. As you reach a new target, move on to the next target until you're reached the top of the wall or your vertical limit.


As you practice this move, you should notice your technique improve and your body strengthen. These advances should also lead to a higher maximum height.
For some, it might take days, weeks, or months of practice before maximum height can be achieved.
The height of the wall will not change your wall run technique. Walls that are especially high will only require more steps up the wall for you to achieve increased vertical distance., Walls can be made from many different kinds of material, and some of these will be more slippery than others. You may also find that some pairs of shoes don't grip well and should be avoided. To be able to execute this move whenever necessary, you'll need to be comfortable running up and over most surfaces.


Always take it slow when running up a new or unfamiliar wall. If the wall is unexpectedly slippery, you could get hurt or injured.
Trying out different kinds of walls will also familiarize you with the kinds you should avoid. Some walls may be too smooth to run up without special tools or assistance., This kind of maneuver requires quick reflexes and strength. By training these along with functional movement and cardio, you can improve your wall run a great deal. Some exercises that might help include:


Running
Doing bodyweight squats and jump squats

Doing push ups
Doing leg lifts

Doing pullups, Parkour is a discipline where people train their reflexes and physical ability through obstacle course exercises. The wall run is a common parkour move, and you might be able to get some pointers on how to do it at a local meetup.


Facebook can be a valuable resource for finding local parkour groups that practice near you. These events frequently take place at playgrounds, parks, and universities."

Plan your meals.,
Double your usual water intake the day before a race.,
Stay off of your feet as much as possible the day before you race.You want to meet the start line with every part of your body feeling refreshed and well-rested.,
Eat complex carbohydrates throughout the day.Grazing on small quantities of complex carbohydratesthroughout the day the day before a race can help you establish the fuel you will need for race-day energy.However, you shouldn’t overload on carbs or attend an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner the night before the race.,
Sleep well the night before the race.You should really be sure that you have slept well the whole week of the race; the sleep you get the night before may be less important than the sleep you have “banked” from the rest of the week.",How to Prepare For a Race the Day Before2," You should not experiment with new meals or nutritional approaches right before a race.The nutritional approach that you used for training should be adequate for race day as well. If you tend to get nervous before events, be sure that you eat a hearty dinner the night before the race in case you are unable to eat well the day of due to nerves.


You should plan to eat breakfast in the morning,then take additional food with you to eat just before the start of the race. For example, you could start with oatmeal at home and follow it up with a banana or an apple after you register.
You may also want to consider whether you need food to eat during or after the race.
Be sure that you purchase any food ahead of time so you do not have to scramble to find things the morning of the race.

, Keep a water bottle in your hand and sip from it all day.You should also drink plenty of water the morning of the race so your body stays hydrated.


To find out if you are dehydrated, check your urine color. The more yellow your urine appears, the more likely it is that you are dehydrated.
Avoid diuretics, which make your body lose water, such as caffeine (tea and coffee) and alcohol.

, Some runners take the entire day off, while others insist on a light jog.


This should be the end of your race-day taper. You should have reduced your training the week of the race.

,


Your last big meal should be 48 hours before a race;opt for more, smaller meals the day of the race.
Avoid fats and alcohol the day before a race. You may also want to avoid trying new foods, as you never know how your body may react.

,


Also make sure your alarm clock is working properly or set alarms on two different devices. Leave yourself plenty of time to eat, relax and get to the starting line on time.

Remain calm and be confident in the work you've done as you head into race day.,
Visualize yourself completing the race.,
Review or establish your pacing goals.,
Do breathing exercises.",How to Prepare For a Race the Day Before3," Some people say that “the practice is the performance.” In other words, the real work is the training, not the race itself. You'll probably experience some last minute nervousness, but don't let that push you into a negative mindset.

, Think through your strategy to help you accomplish your goals. However, remember to have a flexible mindset as well. The course may not look exactly like you had pictured, you might not realize how other runners could affect your own performance, and the weather may change your race experience.


Approach your race day with an open mind and excitement, rather than with a set of rigid expectations about the race details or your performance.

, After becoming familiar with the racecourse, think about split or pacing goals for each section of the race.Mentally prepare for how you may feel at each stage of the race and have a plan for overcoming any negative feelings.


Have a plan for dealing with hills, your shoe coming untied, feeling overtired, etc. If you have a plan ahead of time, it will be easier to deal with the unexpected.Do not change your plan or goals at the last minute., If you feel jittery or nervous, do some breathing exercises to help calm your nerves. You want to feel relaxed before a race.Take a deep breath in through your nose, counting to 6 and allowing your diaphragm to expand. Then slowly breathe out through your mouth, counting to 7 and allowing all of your breath to completely leave your chest. Pause a few seconds and repeat 10 times. "

Make a commitment.",How to Increase Your Running Stamina," There are several benefits to interval training that will help you get the most out of your runs, and increase your stamina.Improve cardiovascular capacity. Endurance running can take wind out of you. By using the interval training, you'll increase your anaerobic capacity (oxygen-depleting). And when you combine this with aerobic capacity (oxygen-building with easy runs and long runs), these will end up making you faster.
Burning calories. Bursts of energy (the high-intensity part of interval training) will increase the amount of calories you burn. This is true even for relatively short bursts.
It adds interest to your running routine. It may seem a small thing, but boredom with your normal running routine can make it much harder to stay motivated.;
, This is the easiest way to incorporate interval training. You simply alternate equal periods of high and low-intensity running.


Start with a ten to fifteen minute warm-up. Start with a rapid walk followed by a slow jog, picking up speed at the end of the warm-up to break into a full run. This will make sure your body is properly warmed-up before you begin the intense speed work
If you are first starting out doing intervals, you need to train your body to get used to the hard intervals. Run at high speed for one minute followed by two minutes of slow running or walking. Repeat these intervals six to eight times. Do this for several weeks until you feel comfortable with the rest. Then lower your recovery/rest time by 30 seconds until you are running 50/50 burst (such as one minute burst followed by one minute rest). Make sure you and your body are ready to increase the intensity of the faster pace intervals and reduce your rest/recovery period before you reduce the rest/recovery time.
End with a fifteen to twenty-five minute cool-down. Ease from a run to a light jog, and then gradually slow to a walk towards the end of the cool-down period.

, Pyramid intervals start with short bursts of high intensity and then build up so that the longest period of high-intensity training is in the middle of your workout. Then, you gradually pull back to the shorter burst of intensity before completing your cool down. This is somewhat more complex than steady intervals, and you may want to use a stopwatch to maintain your times.


Warm up for ten to fifteen minutes. As described above, begin with a rapid walk followed by a light jog, picking up speed at the end of the warmup so that you are running at high intensity at the end of the warmup period.
Run for 30 seconds at high intensity. Then, run at low intensity for one minute. Continue as follows:
45 seconds high, one-minute, fifteen-second low.
60 seconds high, one-minute, thirty-second low.
90 seconds high, two minute low.
60 seconds high, one-minute, thirty-second low.
45 seconds high, one-minute, fifteen-second low.
50 seconds high, one minute low.
Finish up with a twenty-minute to thirty-minute cool down, ending at a comfortable walk.
NOTE--> When you start out any interval training program, you need to make sure your body is adjusted and ready to start it. Doing too much too soon can lead to injuries. Just like when you are building up your mileage, you don't just build up. You gradually build up. IF you are pointing to a specific race, you do longer intervals with longer rest several months before the race. As the race approaches, you increase the intensity and shorten the recovery.

, If you play sports like tennis in addition to running, you know that speed and stamina requirements vary according to the conditions of the game. Variable intervals help you to mix up short and long high-intensity intervals in an unpredictable pattern, which more closely mimics the irregular bursts of speed that are part of typical playing conditions.


Warm up for ten to fifteen minutes of easy running.
Mix it up. Run for two minutes at high intensity and then jog slowly for two-minutes, thirty-seconds. Run at top speed for 30 seconds and then jog for 45 seconds. Mix up your intervals at random. Just make sure that you rest for longer periods after longer high-intensity intervals than you do for short bursts. When starting out, keep your rest periods slightly longer until your body is ready to shorten the rest intervals.
Cool down for fifteen to twenty-five minutes.

, When you run intervals on a treadmill, the machine mixes up both the speed and the incline, presenting you with new and unpredictable challenges. Just make sure to warm up and cool down afterward if these periods aren't built into the interval training program.

, Weight training increases your running economy, which means that you use oxygen more efficiently during your run. Try doing free weights, machines or other strength training exercises three times per week.

, Pedaling on a high-tension exercise bike setting works your leg muscles even more than running uphill, without the impact on your joints.


While you pedal on an exercise bike, gradually increase the tension until you can barely move the wheel.
Stand up and do intervals of pedaling as fast as you can. Rest and lower the tension between intervals. For example:

Stand and pedal at high tension for 30 seconds. Then sit, lower the tension and pedal more slowly for 1 minute.
Keep alternating between standing and pedaling at high intensity and sitting and pedaling at low intensity for 1 minute.
You can also perform pyramid intervals of 30, then 45, then 60, then 90 seconds. Then, bring it down by doing 60, 45 and then 30 second intervals. Be sure to do the lower-intensity seated pedaling between the high-intensity intervals.


Sign up for a spinning class—the instructor will guide the class through a prepared set of pedaling exercises that will dramatically increase your stamina.

, You can either swim as a break after a hard workout or simply include some swimming to change up your routine. Swimming has the added advantage of working your upper body muscles, which are typically underdeveloped in runners., For example, if you run 2 miles (3.2 km) per day, then add 2⁄10 mile (0.3 km) to your daily run for a week. Continue adding 10 percent to your run to increase your stamina. But make sure to alternate your training. For example, if you run 20 miles (32 km) a week, you will increase it to 22 miles (35 km) the next week. But the week after that, bring your mileage back down thus allowing your body to adapt (so run maybe 18-20 miles). Then the week after that, take it up to 25 miles (40 km) a week, followed by reducing your mileage to 21–23 miles (34–37 km) then following week. Gradually build up your running. The peak mileage you pick depends on the race you would like to do.

, If you're used to running 2 miles (3.2 km) per day during the week, then take a weekend run for 4 miles (6.4 km).

, For example, run at 60 percent of your capacity for longer distances. The long run is meant to help build stamina, and it is not a race. Make sure to take easy days before and after these runs.

, Plyometrics exercises like jumping rope and skipping drills can help to improve your running mechanics by lessening the amount of time that your feet stay on the ground.

, For the last quarter of your workout, run as quickly as you can before cooling down. This exercise will help you to counteract late-race fatigue.

, Whether you're running outdoors or on a treadmill, change your incline frequently to give your cardio workout a boost..

, Cut out refined carbs and eat more lean protein and vegetables. Also, eat smaller, more frequent meals.

, It will help to stick with your regimen if you make a schedule, and stick to it. It will help you accomplish your goal of increasing your stamina, and will also give you an opportunity to gather metrics: do you maintain a steady pace? Are you able to run longer or or faster (or both), or have you reached a plateau? Here is a sample schedule that will help you develop both endurance and speed:



Day 1 - Steady Intervals. Warm up for 15-20 minutes, then run at high speed for one minute followed by one-minute, fifteen-seconds of slow running or walking. Repeat these intervals six to eight times. Maintain a steady time for each phase (using a stopwatch), and then cool down 20-30 minutes, gradually slowing to a walk.

Day 2 - Easy run day (only 2–5 miles (3.2–8.0 km), depending on you and your running experience).

Day 3 -Pyramid intervals. Warm up for ten to fifteen minutes, and then run a pyramid interval set, as described above.

Run at a comfortable pace for 15 minutes, then do a variable interval set.
Finish up with a twenty to twenty-five minute cool down, ending at a comfortable walk.



Day 4 - Easy run (2–5 miles (3.2–8.0 km),depending on you and your running experience).

Day 5 - Easy run (2–5 miles (3.2–8.0 km),depending on you and your running experience).

This might seem like a lot of rest, but then you did run pretty hard on Day 3. And given you are running long on Day 6, it would be best to be well rested when you run long.



Day 6 - Long run. Start slowly and run at an easy, conversational pace for 40 to 90 minutes. It is helpful to have a friend or family who is willing to run with you, or at least follow along on a bike.

Day 7 - Rest day (2–5 miles (3.2–8.0 km), depending on you and your running experience. Every 8th week, take the day off.)

, Push yourself once every three weeks or so with this technique:


Find a local track or flat surface of about 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) (400 meters) to run on. Avoid streets, as they are too curved; the curb foot will be noticeably lower than the street-side foot.
Stretch with dynamic stretches (not static) and do a light warm up (e.g. 25 push ups or jog).
Do a 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) sprint followed by a 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) jog. Do the sprint and jog routine for at least 2 miles (3.2 km).
Exceed your reach. Once you've reached your limits of duration, make note of the time and the location of your run. Keep that as your minimum distance/duration, and try to beat that number. As you improve, raise your baseline.
Do a cool down. After every run, you do not just want to stop running. Walk the run off till your heart rate is moderate. Then stretch.

, Do not quit your regimen, do not tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow, do not tell yourself you're too tired, and do not tell yourself you're too busy. Run in the morning to get it over with.

Become familiar with the basics of the triple jump.,
Familiarize yourself with the different jump lengths.,
Understand the three phases of the triple jump.,
The First Phase, or the hop, will set you up for the rest of the jump.,
The Second Phase, or the skip, is the most crucial phase.,
The Third Phase, or jump, is the final phase of the jump.,
Develop your leg strength.,
Try leg-hopping.,
Try to build up your hamstrings and your calf muscles.








,
Speed is crucial in the jump.",How to Triple Jump," The triple jump is a track & field event that requires leg strength, technique and speed. It requires the athlete to run down a strip leading into a sandpit.






;
, Triple jump has different boards on which you choose to take your jump from. Most high school pits include 20ft (6 meters), 24ft (7.3 meters), 28ft (8.5 meters), 32ft (9.75meters), 36ft (10.97) and 49ft (14.93 meters). If you are a beginner, you will want to start on an easy board, such as the 24ft (7.3 meters).








, Jump in a rhythm. The first step is hop, the second is step, the third is jump:









The first phase requires the athlete to jump off one foot.
The second is to land on the same foot and jump again.
The third time you'll land on the other foot and jump into the sand pit.
If your stronger foot is your left, then go right, right, left. If it's the right foot, then go left, left, right. Try starting with both legs though.

, When you jump off the board, throw the jumping knee in the air, thigh parallel with the ground. Your opposite foot should be pulled up behind you. When you land, hit the ground with your foot even, not heel first. This will help keep momentum going forward and keep up your speed.








, Many new jumpers have a weak second phase, therefore lowering the overall length of their jump. The form of the second phase is much like the first. After coming off your first step, throw your jumping knee up and your opposite knee back. When you go to land, however, throw the opposite foot forward to progress into the next phase. Remember to land with your foot flat and spring right up into the next phase.








, After your second phase, simply throw your feet in front of you, much like the long jump. Remember to lean forward, or you may fall backward and lose distance on the final measurement.








, Before you compete in a track meet, you must develop leg strength. The triple jump cannot be performed properly without leg strength. A good way of developing this is to do squats and Olympic lifts, such as the clean and jerk. Do not try do build your leg muscles by doing leg curls, as these are hard on your knees and they do not build proprioceptive strength.








, A very effective way to develop leg strength is to get wooden boxes 1 foot (30.5 cm) in depth or something approximate. Your track coach should have these lying around. Hop on them with one foot on and one off, until you feel the burn and then alternate the feet. If you work hard and have the willpower to become a top athlete, you will soon see the results.








,, Practicing short sprints, 50 meters or less, will help you gain distance.








"
"
Make sure you're a good candidate for Plyometric Exercises:


You should be able to perform a full back squat with at least 1.5 times your body weight (e.g.,
Better safe than sorry: Start slow and learn the movements first, then gradually increase the intensity of your workouts.

,
Make sure you are well rested: Plyometric Exercises used to improve vertical jump are taxing on the Central Nervous System (CNS), the muscles, and the joints.,
Figure out the exercises you need to implement in your plyometric training that will help improve vertical jump.,
Quality over Quantity: For high impact exercises, limit each set to 4-6 repetitions.,
Design a well thought-out Plyometrics workout: Plyometric exercises should be done before strength training to avoid injuries.",How to Increase Your Vertical Jump Through Plyometrics," If you weight 150lbs, you should be able to squat 225lbs for 1 repetition).
You should not be grossly overweight. If you are, it is recommended you lose a bit of weight to put less pressure on your joints.;
,, It is important to be well rested before performing them.

, One high impact/intensity exercise is more than enough per workout. Here's a list of some of the most effective exercises with their impact levels:


Depth Jumps: This is a jump performed upon reaching the ground after the athlete steps off a platform or a box. Impact Level: High.






Altitude Drops: Use a high box (~20% higher than your standing vertical jump) and step off of it. Attempt to absorb the impact when you land while making sure you bend the knees as little as possible and staying mostly on your toes. Impact Level: High.






Box Jumps: stand in front of a box then jump on it, then step off. This can also be done unilaterally. Low impact but high intensity.






Reactive Squats: Start similarly to squats w/ 20-50% of your max squat weight. From the standing position, drop quickly down into a deep squat position and then quickly reverse direction. Impact Level: Medium.






Jump Squats: Use 30-60% of your squat weight. Do a quarter squat then jump up. Impact Level: Medium.







, For medium impact, limit each set to 8-10 repetitions. Make sure to rest well between each set.

, High impact exercises should be limited to 1 during a training phase, you should be mentally and physically prepared, you should have at least 1-day of rest between workouts that include plyometric exercises. An example program would be the following:


Warm up: Some light cardio and dynamic stretching to prepare your body.






Power Skipping: 3 Sets, each for ~25 meters or ~25 yards. 90 seconds rest between sets.






Depth Jumps: 4 Sets of 5 Repetitions. 3 minutes of rest between sets.
Box Jumps: 3 Sets of 6 repetitions. 2 minutes of rest between sets.
Leapfrog Jumps: 3 Sets, each for ~25 meters of ~25 years. 60 seconds rest between sets.

Inspect the long jump area.,
Find your dominant foot.,
Count your steps.,
Mark the place where you land.,
Get in position.,
Ask someone to check your position on the jumping board.,
Run down the track.,
Move your mark if adjustment is necessary.

,
Check your mark again.,
Jump.,
Throw your body weight forward when you land.,
Walk out the front/side of the pit.

",How to Long Jump," Note all the aspects that will affect your jumping, like:


The position of the jumping board. Ensure that you are able to cover the distance between the board and pit prior to your initial jump.
The width of the track, you will want to center yourself so that you won’t worry about stepping off.
The material composition of the track. If the track is rubberized, you can use spikes.;
, Ask a friend to gently push you forward from behind. The foot that you step forward with is your dominant foot.

, Start with your dominant foot placed on top of the center of the jumping board, since that is where you will want to jump from. Then run at the pace that you are expecting to run towards the jump. Measure off at 5, 6 or 7 steps, counting one step as every time your dominant foot hits the ground.

, Do this with a rock or piece of tape to the side of the track. Make sure that the mark you make will be easy to see, even when other people are using similar materials.


Check your mark. Do this by performing a run through (i.e. run as if you are going to jump but run through the pit instead.)

, Place your foot on the center of the track in line with your mark. You may have to ask people to move out of the way. Make sure that no one will cross the track while you are running.

, If adjustment is necessary, you can move your mark further from or closer to the pit.

, Take long, fast strides and keep your back straight, looking straight forward. When you come near the jumping board, do not look down, this will cause you to lose momentum.

,, If you feel like you might still be off mark, perform another run through until you are comfortable with your marks.

, Align yourself with your mark and run, just like before. When you come to the board, jump vertically: your speed will carry you forward.


When you jump, you want to shoot your chest out, and look to the sky with your arms in back of your body. Land with your arms and legs in front of you, as close to fully-extended as possible.

, Use your remaining forward momentum to do this. You will be measured from the furthest back mark you make so you don’t want to fall backwards.

Learn the ""J"".,
Take off.,
Know how to move while in the air.",How to High Jump Using the Fosbury Flop," The run-up to the bar is called a ""J"" because the athlete runs in the shape of a ""J"" as he/she approaches the bar.









Run back 10 steps from the center of the bar in the shape of a ""J"": the hook part should be five steps, and the line should be three steps. If you are right-footed, you will run in from the left side of the pit, left-footed jumpers will come in from the other side. (This can be for starters. It is important to find what is comfortable for you to do, and which side is more convenient for you.)
Run five steps forward in a straight line towards the pit. This will allow you to gain speed.
Your next 3 steps will be curved to accelerate towards the pit and build torque (angular momentum). These steps should be run on a curve-- if you were to continue running these steps, you would eventually start running in circles. Instead, take three, which will simulate the circular motion and accelerate you towards the bar.
The second-to-last step should be another quick step towards the bar. This is called the ""penultimate step."" In this step, you should continue to drive your momentum forward and should still be standing tall as if you were a sprinter. Bring both hands back, locked at the elbows.;
, The last step, the ""ultimate step,"" is performed by making a quick step as if you were doing a lay-up in basketball. Point your non-takeoff foot toward the back-left corner of the pit (righties) or back-right hand corner of the pit (lefties). The short step will allow all that speed you acquired to be transferred into height. Using all your strength, drive your hands forward and up, and jump straight up as high as you can. When jumping, you will drive your take-off knee hard into the air to give you more height.








,









Drive your lead-arm up high; this will guide your body over the bar. Arch the arm so it is the first part of your body that is over the bar. Simultaneously, you must allow your body to turn because you have built up so much angular momentum; your body will turn as you are in the air. Control this speed and momentum and harness it when your body has turned 180 degrees and you are perpendicular with the bar.
Once you are perpendicular with the bar, you will continue to rise until you reach your maximum height over the bar. Once this is accomplished, your body will start to glide into the bar (the momentum will push you forward even though you have only jumped straight up).
Thrust your hips and tilt your head back. Now your body will be perpendicular with the bar and your body will be arched with your hips high in the air above your head and feet. Your head will be over the bar and your head on the way down towards the mat. Your hips will ideally be at their highest point as they travel over the bar, and your feet will be hanging with your knees locked and evenly spaced over the bar (looking at pictures of this will help).
Kick your feet up and over the bar. By tucking your chin into your chest and concentrating, you will automatically bring your feet up and they will fly forward over the bar. Sometimes this takes practice and repetition but it is the easiest part of the flop to master.
Land on your upper back or shoulders on the mat; your feet will land over your head.

"
"
Before you begin, it is a good idea to know what a tuck jump looks like.,
Start with your feet together with your arms extended straight above you (your arms should cover your ears).

,
Swing your arms down; as you do so, bend your knees slightly.

,
When your arms reach your legs, swing them back up so they are over your head and extend your knees, pushing off your toes to initiate the jump.

,
Once your feet leave the ground, bend your knees and pull them to your stomach so your toes point towards the ground, keeping your legs together and your toes pointed.

,
Straighten your legs to prepare to land.

,
Bend your knees slightly to land.,
As with most gymnastics skills, practice and repetition are important to master the movement.,
Once you think you have it mastered, practice in front of a mirror or have someone watch you so you know what you need to fix (be sure you allow yourself enough space that you won't hit anything).",How to Do Tuck Jumps for Beginner Gymnastics," Search for videos online or ask someone you know to demonstrate for you so you get a general idea of what a tuck jump should look like.;
,,,,,, This reduces the impact on your knees, hips, and spine.

, You'll likely have to do a lot of tuck jumps before they look and feel correct.

, Think about the following points: arms straight above your head (no bent elbows), toes pointed during the jump, legs together throughout, and whether your knees bend but your feet point behind you (you want to pull your knees to your chest so that your toes point straight down towards the ground).

Find a cliff with a significant amount of water underneath it.,
Dress appropriately.,
Check for rocks.,
Check the cliff itself for obstacles.,
Be under no illusions – cliff-diving does present a danger to your body.,
Make the great jump!,
Land well.,
Finished.
",How to Dive Off a Cliff," The need for a certain water depth is determined by the height of the cliff; for example, for 30-40 feet (9-12 meters) of drop, the water below must be at least 12 feet (4+ meters) deep and free of any objects. If there is significant wave action be certain that when the wave is out you still have the minimum amount of water depth below you. Research the area you're planning to jump off and also check out the guidelines put in place by the World High Diving Federation because they have some very useful height and depth measurements that they have calculated to reduce risks.Also ask boaters, expert jumpers who have already jumped the relevant cliff, marina or tourist staff, and other people who would have knowledge about the cliff and its suitability for diving off. If it's already a place where people jump off successfully, that may be a good reassurance or may give you cause to pause if you learn otherwise. See ""Tips"" for famous cliff-diving locations.


Be aware of the laws regarding the cliff. If it's a tourist attraction like La Quebrada, you can be certain that no tourist will actually be allowed to perform a dive. And if it's a known diving location, there may be warning signs or requirements in place that you need to know about. Ask around before assuming anything.
Check out access to the cliff. Unless you're diving in shoes (see next step), you may be clambering up a rocky cliff face in bare feet and you'll need to know which access routes the experienced cliff divers usually use.;
, For a cliff jump under 30 feet, wear a secure and aerodynamic bathing suit; avoid anything flimsy or flapping and definitely have nothing that's over-sized. Remember - this gear has to stay on when you land in that water!


For cliffs over 30 feet, it is best to jump in soft cloth shorts and have tennis shoes on your feet.
Goggles are not recommended during a jump as they will fly off when you hit the water.
Some advice suggests that a wetsuit is best because it provides impact cushioning between your skin and the water as you hit it.
Preferably, don't wear glasses but contacts are permissible if you're good at keeping your eyes shut until you surface.

, Find a pair of excellent goggles and a snorkel for the checking crew to wear. Have at least two snorkelers swim underneath the cliff you intend to jump off as ""spotters"" for possible dangers. They will examine the area for hidden rocks, branches, limbs, or other projections that could cause you harm when you jump and hit the water. While snorkeling, identify a location that will allow jumpers to climb back out of the water and to the top of the cliff again.


An example of a landing danger is shown by La Quebrada's unique situation. The cliff dive here can only be undertaken at high tide and even then the dive must end when an incoming wave pushes up the water to its highest point in the inlet! That kind of precision takes years of training and care and isn't something you can just jump into unawares.

, Are there any snags, parts jutting out, or other possible obstacles that could break your fall or throw you off course? Be sure to avoid any cliff that has such problems because they increase the risk tremendously. Another thing to check for is the safest way back to shore, avoiding rocks and riptides, etc.


Also look for wind problems. Everything may look great but certain features might cause wind problems that could slam you back into the cliff. Ask experts who have dived off that cliff first.
Is there wildlife hanging about? Even hitting a fish can cause injury but hitting a dolphin, whale or seal will definitely cause problems. Avoid any area teeming with wildlife.

, Diving off a cliff is not only dangerous because of the cliff itself and the water below but also because of the speed of impact. A jump from 20 feet (6 meters) above water will cause you to hit the water at 25 mph (40 kph) and that can compress your spine, break your bones or cause concussion.The World High Diving Federation recommends that no cliff dives of 65.5 feet (20 meters) or higher take place without professional scuba divers being positioned in the water.Before you attempt a cliff dive – can you dive? It's foolhardy to be jumping off a cliff not knowing the basic principles of a safe and good dive technique and to know how it feels to dive. It's recommended that you practice diving off high diving platforms at the local pool before trying cliff diving. And this should also be done under supervision until you know what you're doing – diving at any height is dangerous when you don't know how to do it properly.

, You will need to propel yourself off the cliff using your knees as a propulsion unit. Falling off the cliff is dangerous as you may hit the side on your way down. Jumping away from the surface will keep you away from the side of the cliff and protect you from harm.


Start by standing erect, with feet together, arms raised straight above your head and bend your knees.
Bring your arms down, then back to hip level and sweep them forward as you drive forward with your legs.
Leap straight out with your body facing perpendicular to the water. While still perpendicular to the water, arch your back and as you do so, gravity will pull you to the vertical position.
In the air, you will need to be as straight as possible (like a pencil). Once gravity has pulled you to this position, bring your arms over your head and place your right hand in a fist with your left locked over it (or vice versa if preferred).
Jump staying straight, with your toes pointed to the water at all times.
Enter the water vertically, perpendicular to the surface. Do not aim to land on your face, stomach, or bottom as this can incur severe damage if you do.

, When you hit the water, stretch your legs and arms out and arch your back. This will keep you from going too deep into the water. Swim to the top and then find your predetermined location to climb back up!


If people are watching, give them a wave to let them know you're okay.

If you are just beginning 300 meter hurdling, you might be familiar with 55 meter or 100 meter hurdling.,
Attack every hurdle and stay low, keep an even distance between the hurdle and your body the whole race when going over.,
Do not pull your lead leg around the hurdle, that will just slow you down.,Run full speed at the end and push yourself even more

,
If you knock a hurdle down don't hesitate.",How to Run the 300 M Hurdles," 100 meter and 300 meter hurdling usually takes place during the outdoor track season, while 55 meter hurdling takes place indoor. In 300 m. races, the hurdles are much farther apart, making it less necessary to count steps in between the hurdles. Most hurdlers gradually learn to stutter the steps up to each hurdle so that they have their dominant leg leading, so there is no reason to hesitate going over each hurdle.;
, 300 meter hurdles are called intermediates, as they have a lower height than 100 meter or 55 meter hurdles. It's easier to get over them so that you can keep sprinting steadily. What you will mostly work on is decreasing airtime and having endurance to finish the race.

, You want to put it up and over getting as low to the hurdle as you can, then with your trail leg snap it so you can spend less time in air, do not drag it along.

,, Concentrate on the finish line and carry on running.

Take one or two preliminary steps.,
Drop into an imaginary chair.,
Push your body up with your legs.,
Breathe out as you leap.,
Land on the balls of your feet.",How to Jump1," Even if you're going to jump straight up into the air, adding a couple of lateral steps into your jumping routine can help you put some extra hop in your step. The energy developed in those steps can help generate additional upward lift that can put an extra inch or two into a vertical leap.A vertical jump is highest off two feet. Use the power of both your legs to push off the ground, even if you're taking a few steps before you hop.;
, To get the most power out of your legs and the most height into your jump, you need to bend your knees. For many people, it's helpful to imagine sitting in an imaginary chair, just before you jump. Your feet should be about shoulder-width apart, and your hips should be flexed at 30 degrees, knees bent 60 degrees, ankles flexed 25 degrees in order to generate the most power without injuring your knees. You should be able to lift your toes up and down while sitting in this squat form, balancing on the balls of your feet.Be careful that your knees don't point inwards in a ""knock-knee"" position, with your toes pointed inward. Keep your knees as straight as possible, ideally positioned vertically over your toes.Have your arms at your sides.
Keep your back very straight while you're jumping. Practice in front of a mirror dropping into the imaginary chair and keeping your back straight to avoid injury.

, Spring off the balls of your feet, swinging your hands up into the air, towards the ceiling, for additional momentum. For some jumpers, it's effective to picture pushing through the floor, or trying to push the ground away from your body, trying to extend your legs with as much power as possible. The power and the height of your jump will come from the power you put into this step.









Properly done, your feet should roll forward, from your heels to your toes as you jump off. You should feel pressure on your heels moving up your feet towards your toes as you come back to a standing position, normally, and in a jump you'll do the same thing much more quickly. You must roll all the way to your toes when you are actually jumping.
Keep your arms parallel to each other and move them just behind your rear. Swing your arms forward while straightening your whole body, as though you were uncoiling a spring.

, Just as when you lift weights when you're doing a rep, it's important to exhale while you're pushing off into a big vertical jump. While this might not necessarily help you jump higher, it's more comfortable and fluid to exhale as you approach the leap. Think of it as one big motion.

, To avoid landing hard and hurting yourself, it's important that you land on the balls of your feet and roll back onto your heels. Landing flat-footed is a good way to twist your ankle. When you land, you should take care to land in such a way as to keep the kinematic chain going in a single plane from the ball of your foot through your ankle into your knee and finally through your hip joint.









Bend your knees slightly before you end to soften the impact on your knees. Let your knees absorb the momentum, falling into a partial squat, not past 90 degrees, to absorb the shock. Straighten up from the squatting posture.
By bending your joints when you land, you transfer the force of landing into your muscles and tendons, which are built to absorb and dissipate force like this. You can even briefly store and release this energy elastically by propelling you into another jump.

Practice your sprints.,
Find your dominant foot.,
Only practice long-jumps in the appropriate track location.,
Sprint to the take-off line.,
Take off.,
Kick your arms and legs forward before the landing.,
Land as softly as possible.",How to Jump2," Long-jumping is a lot more like sprinting than it is like high-jumping. If you want to develop the distance of your jumps, you need to work on your speed. Practice wind-sprints, long distance running, and working on your short bursts of speed. Good long jumpers are fast runners.








, If you're going to work on your long jump, you'll leap off your dominant foot, the foot you feel most comfortable leaping from or kicking with. Usually, this will be the same foot on the side that you write with, but not necessarily. If you're not sure, take a soccer ball outside and kick it around a few times. Which side feels more comfortable? That's probably your dominant foot, and it'll be your plant foot for long jumps.

, Long-jumping is usually done in a sand pit, and careful technique is necessary to avoid injury. Never attempt long-jumping using this form on the ground.


If you don't have access to a long-jump pit, you need to practice doing hops and landing on your feet. This is a great way of building up your distance and getting better long jumps later. It won't be time wasted working out.

, The take-off line should be clearly marked, beyond which will be the landing zone, where your jump will be marked. When you're long-jumping, it's important to take off as close to the line as possible to get the most out of your jump, but not to cross it, or your jump won't count. Watch the line closely, and plant your plant foot just on the right side of it.









Accelerate and continue powering to the take-off line. You need to be going as fast as possible when you reach the end of the running strip. It's your momentum that should carry you into the jump, less than your strength.

, Plant your dominant foot on the right side of the line and focus on jumping as far forward as possible, thrusting your hips forward as much as possible. Let your momentum carry you up and over the line and into the landing pit as far as possible. Thrust your hips forward to carry you as far as possible.








, As you feel the apex of your leap begin to pass and you feel yourself starting to come down, thrust your feet and your arms forward to prepare for the landing and to give yourself a few extra inches on your leap. The jump will be measured at the farthest point you touch from the take-off line, so sticking your feet out far in front of you is important.








, The landing isn't nearly as graceful as the take-off in a good long-jump. Your landing should be mostly dictated from proper take-off form, but you can keep yourself safe by keeping your knees flexed slightly, your ankles very straight, and not using your wrists to brace your fall. Let the sand do the work for you.

Get stronger.,
Improve your flexibility with regular stretching.,
Strengthen your inner abs.,
Strengthen your dorsi-flexors.,
Work out your toes.",How to Jump3," Technique and conditioning are the two most important parts of jumping. You must first know how to move your body correctly in order to achieve the motion. It is then necessary to train your muscles and joints to withstand the exertion you put on them as well as allowing them to assist you in jumps of greater distance. That means strength training, aerobic exercise, and flexibility.

, The athletes and dancers who can make the most powerful jumps are the ones with total body flexibility. If you're jumping over a hurdle, it helps to be able to swing your leading leg wherever you want it to go so that you can maximize the momentum of your jump.


The best jumpers have 3:2 strength ratio between their quadriceps and hamstrings, respectively. If you're not flexible, you tend to develop an imbalance of strength that will limit your ability to jump. Stretch regularly so you can increase and maintain flexibility in your ankles, knees, and hips., Just because they don't make a six-pack doesn't mean you should neglect your inner abs (the transverse abdominal wall). They play a key role in every power movement, including jumping. To strengthen them, suck in your stomach with a deep breath, hold for 20 seconds, then release. Repeat 4 times, 3-4 times a week.







, These muscles are used to decrease the angle between your foot and your leg (when you bring your toes closer to your shins). When you're jumping, you actually need to opposite motion (plantarflexion, the same motion as when you push down on the pedal when driving) to push off of the ground. So why strengthen your dorsi-flexors? Because each set of muscles is only as strong as its opposing set. Your ability to push your foot down will be limited by your ability to pull your foot up, because the dorsi-flexors act as stabilizers. One way to exercise your dorsi-flexors is to walk around on your heels, without letting the balls of your feet touch the ground, until you feel a good burn.







, You might think that the only people who need to work out their toes are ballet dancers, but the fact is that your toes add to the pushing power of your feet. In a proper jump, they're the last part of your body to leave the ground, and a little extra push from your toes can improve the power of your jump. To strengthen you toes muscles, curl and uncurl your toes repeatedly, or push up onto your tip toes and hold for at least 10 seconds.

Practice your running technique.,
Prepare to run towards the mat.,
Begin running.,
Jump towards the mat.,
Practice the Fosbury Flop.,
Prepare to launch yourself over the bar.,
Clear the bar.,
Land on the mat properly.,
Resist the reflex to curl up.,
Improve your jump height and form.,
Clear the bar using scissor jumps.,
Run towards the bar at a steady speed to gain momentum.,
Push off from the ground.,
Complete the jump.,
Improve your technique.",How to High Jump (Track and Field)," When a jumper runs towards the bar they are building the momentum necessary to jump over the bar.Therefore, you need to perfect the running technique before you attempt to jump over anything. Practice by running towards a gymnastics mat and behaving as if there was a bar in front of it. This is the same kind of mat that will be behind the bar when you’re ready jump over it.;
, Most jumpers only take about 10 strides before they jump over the bar, so make sure you’re at least ten paces away from the mat to simulate this.If you’re a beginner step even further back about 5 to 6 strides to give yourself plenty of room to gain momentum.


Don’t stand directly in front of the mat. You will be running in a “J” shape by turning towards the bar about ten strides into your run. Therefore, you need to be at least nine feet to the left or the right of the mat before you start running. If your right leg is dominant you should be to the right of the mat. If your left leg is dominant, go to the left of the mat.
Women typically step 9 to 13 feet to the left or right of the mat and begin their run 35 to 55 feet back,while men typically step 12 to 16 feet to the left or right of the mat and begin 50 to 70 feet back., Use your non-dominant foot to push off. Some athletes start low to the ground and will be in an upright position by stride three.Do what is most comfortable for you, but while practicing it may be easier to start standing up.









Be sure to run in a “J” shape. The path you create with your run will look like a ""J"" because you run straight and then curve toward the bar at the end. Run straight toward the corner of the mat for about 5 strides to gain momentum. Begin to curve so you will eventually be parallel with the bar after about 3 strides.
Do not accelerate or decelerate. Maintain a consistent speed so your momentum is not lost., This can also be called a “push off.” Push off into the air with your non-dominant foot. The non-dominant leg will automatically be extended as you jump and you'll drive up your opposite knee.








Don’t land on the mat. Instead, land on your feet. At this point you are just practicing the running form. However, the mat will help to catch you if you accidentally fall.

, This form was first used at the Olympics in Mexico City in 1968 by Dick Fosbury to win a gold medal.His technique, affectionately called the Fosbury Flop, requires leaping head first with your back to the bar. It is now the most common technique among professional jumpers.








, When you’ve finished the “J” run and are next to the mat, rotate your back to the bar for the Fosbury Flop.As you drive your knee up and push off from your non-dominant leg, pivot your body to face the sky. This may feel unnatural the first few jumps, but keep practicing until it becomes second nature.








, Tilt your head and upper back toward the mat. Angle your head back and keep your chin un-tucked as you clear the bar to avoid injury. Arch your back up. As you arch and lift your hips over the bar, your head will fall back.After your hips have cleared the bar you will naturally tuck your head to your chest to help lift your feet over.









Lift your feet up and over. Timing is critical here as there may only be a small amount of clearance for getting your legs over the bar. As your hips cross the bar and come down, give your legs a quick kick up and over to clear the bar.Try to keep your arms close to your body for a more solid center of gravity.

, Touch the mat with your upper back first. After clearing the bar you'll want to land on your upper back and shoulders to avoid injury.The rest of your body will follow and it may feel right to let the movement turn into a backward tumble. If so, relax and try to roll into the tumble.









If you tumble, push the roll to either the left or right side of your upper back and put your body's weight over the respective shoulder (rather than directly over the head) so the pressure is distributed away from the neck.Keep your mouth closed. If you hold it open, you may bite your tongue.

, Keep your body open so that you don’t smash your knees against your face. Don't relax once your back touches the mat, and keep your legs a comfortable distance apart from each other as your knees will likely bend and come forward, even if you aren't rolling backward.If you hit the bar while jumping, it may be knocked off of its perch and into the air. If so, it may fall on you, on the mat, or be on an angle that could harm you if you land on it. If you hit the bar, cover your face with your arms while landing to prevent being injured by the bar.

, Practice jumping and landing until you’re completely comfortable with it. Nobody learns to high jump overnight, so don't get down on yourself if you find it challenging at first. Practice as much as you can and talk with other high jumpers or coaches to get tips. If a friend is watching they can give you pointers on how your form looks and help you perfect the landing on the mat.









To push yourself, raise the bar in increments of 3 centimeters.Three centimeters may seem small, but you'll feel the difference the next time you try it.
Some people find it helpful to record their progress in a journal. To do so, write down the height of the bar you’re jumping over as you practice. If you continue to raise the bar each week and record your highest jumps, you can track your improvement.

, If the head-first flop looks too daring at this stage, you may choose to jump the bar a different way. A simple, less complicated jump called a “scissor jump” is done by following the same run path. Instead of flinging yourself backwards over the bar, you cross over the bar in a sitting position with your back straight and your legs extended in front of you.Make sure the bar is relatively close to the mat, especially if you’re a beginner. It’s important to master the technique before you attempt to jump over a high bar.

, If you’ve practiced the “J” run enough, you should be able to confidently run towards the bar with the correct form. Don't cut corners during the ""J"" run to save time; it's important to run the full path to give yourself more momentum to jump., When you practiced running, you jumped by pushing off with your non-dominant leg and thrusting your dominant knee into the air. This time, push off with your non-dominant leg but swing your dominant foot into the air, keeping your leg straight. You should be bent at the waist as if you’re sitting on the floor, and your foot should never be higher than your hips.


When you jump your body should be parallel to the bar. You will be jumping in a “sideways” motion that will carry you over the bar.

, Swing your non-dominant leg up towards your extended leg, keeping both legs straight. This will create a motion similar to scissors closing; thus, the name “Scissor Jump.” Keep your back straight and your legs extended in front of you. Your momentum will carry you over the bar and onto the mat.

, Practice scissor jumping until you’re comfortable doing it. As you get better, increase the height of the bar slowly. Once you’ve reached your maximum height, it’s time to move on to a more advanced jumping form.

Determine your dominant leg, which is the leg that will lead your body over the hurdle.,
Starting with the correct footing is crucial to running hurdles, which is why you need to determine your dominant leg first.,
Lead with your dominant leg, raising the leg straight over the hurdle.,
Your opposite arm should be bent at the elbow with your forearm parallel to your chest.

,
Your other arm (same side as dominant foot) should be straight back, with your palm facing upwards.

,
Your non-dominant leg is known as the trailing leg.,
While you are jumping over the hurdle, bend your body at the waist and lean straight down towards your dominant leg.,
After jumping a hurdle you will land with your dominant foot first.,
After jumping over all 5 hurdles, sprint to the finish line which is 8 meters after the fifth hurdle.

",How to Run 55 Meter Hurdles on an Indoor Track," You could use both legs as dominant legs if you take an even amount of steps between the hurdles. Otherwise, you will take an odd amount of steps (like 5 steps for beginners, or 3 steps for the more experienced) between the hurdles and have one dominant leg.;
, You need to land with your non-dominant foot as the last step before you jump the hurdle, in order for your dominant leg to lead you. There are 13 meters between the starting line and first hurdle; you need to learn how many steps it takes you to sprint those 13 meters. If you take an even number of steps to the first hurdle then you start with your dominant foot back and your non-dominate foot on the starting line. If you take an odd amount of steps to the first hurdle then you start with your dominant foot on the starting line, and your non-dominant foot behind. Most people take 7 or 8 steps to the first hurdle.

, You want your dominant leg to be slightly out from the center of the hurdle. (Right dominant slightly right of center, and left dominant slightly left of center)

,,, This leg should be bent at the knee, with toes pointed up and outward. The trailing leg should be level when jumping over the hurdle, and then pulled toward the hurdles center before landing. The trailing leg is the part that is most likely to hit a hurdle during the sprint. There is no penalty for hitting a hurdle during a race, but it slows down the runner and disturbs balance. Make sure to pull the trailing leg over the hurdle and back toward the hurdles center.

, This conserves speed and energy for the runner.

, You must land with the intention to keep running your sprint. The amount of steps between hurdles will decrease over time. Most people run 5 steps between hurdles (3 if you have mastered the techniques) in order to keep the same dominant foot throughout. Take 4 steps if you are alternating dominate legs. Take the amount of steps you are comfortable with and continue to jump over the next 4 hurdles.

Start the race in a sprint.,
Do not slow down at the first hurdle: your momentum is what will carry you over.,
Drag the trail leg sideways over the side of the hurdle after the lead leg has passed over.,
Continue the race, trying to pick up speed towards the end.",How to Hurdle," If you don't stretch, you can become seriously injured. (Pulling hamstrings are common);
, Make sure you have your lead and trail legs figured out before the race starts. The lead leg is the leg that goes over the hurdle extended before your body.









The lead leg is usually the leg that people use to catch themselves while falling. People can trip forward or have someone push them to find which leg makes sense for them. Many people also switch back and forth between legs which is a possibility.

, The number of steps you take will depend on how long the course is, as well as on the person's height, weight, speed, the height of their jump, the length of the jump, and even their usual sprinting stride length. You might take 4-5 steps before the first hurdle on a 60m course and 6-8 on a 100m course.









Steps in between will be different for every person. One thing to note, however, is that if the hurdles are evenly spaced, you should have the same amount of steps in between every hurdle. You should not take three huge steps and then eight little steps... Instead maybe take 6 regular stride steps.
Picture yourself going barely an inch over the jump. You might find that when you try to get as low as possible, you end up clearing the jump by plenty, while increasing your speed. Practice really does make perfect! And leaning forward opens a whole new world of speed.

, You want to be going pretty fast before you reach the first hurdle, and you want to be able to make it to the first hurdle at the right speed to have your favored foot forward.








, When you are about 1 to 2 feet away from the hurdle, bring the foot that isn't on the ground (lead leg) up to your butt and then quickly extend it up over the hurdle.








, The ankle and the knee are supposed to be the same distance from the ground. The straight line along the shin/calf in between the ankle and the knee must be parallel to the ground and must be parallel to the hurdle.

, Clearing the last hurdle can be difficult, but if you push yourself too much, it will be no problem, but it can hurt in the end.

Start the exercises by first warming up your muscles.,
Stand up and sit down.,
Do the toe raises by raising up and down on the tips of the toes.,
Crouch down to do the Deep Knee Bend Jump, arms out.,
Hop on each leg by standing on one foot, and hopping up and down on it.,
Find something with a flat top at least 1–3 feet (0.3–0.9 m) high that is extremely stable for jumping on.",How to Jump 6 to 12 Inches Higher and Run Faster," Stretch legs and arms, and jog around for a few minutes.;
, Slowly bend at the knees keeping your back straight. Crouch down as low as possible arms on your waist and slowly rise back up.

, Arms at your waist again, do this slowly but steadily.This is the most crucial part so do it several other times before exploding.

, Do this quickly, by almost touching your bottom to the ground, then explode upwards as high as you can. As you come down, land with your bottom near the ground (like the starting point)and then immediately launch back up again.

, Change to the other foot, and do the same thing.

, Stand in front of it (with knees shoulder width apart). Gather yourself and leap onto the flat surface (Be sure to leave both feet at the same time). Jump back off the surface and try to land softly on your feet. Repeat quickly as many times as you can--it's the quickness that will build up fast-twitch muscles and make your results practical. Rest for as short a time as you can manage and begin again. You'll be able to slam dunk in no time. Pro tip: Try to picture yourself landing as softly as 'Spiderman' when you jump on the table. If you can manage it people will tell you it looked like you were kind of floating. Very cool.

Get the right equipment.,
Get ready the day before your race.,
Do not eat a big breakfast on race day.,
Don't give up!,
Make an effort to catch other runners.,
Power through the hills.,
Use landmarks to help you.,
Sprint to the finish line!",How to Win a Cross Country Race," It is an essential part of any race. Depending on the terrain, you'll want to get specific running shoes for that environment. If you will be running on cement or gravel most of the race, then take the spikes out of your racing flats and if your serious about running invest in a pair of road racers. If most of the course is sand, dirt, grass, etc. then you use racing flats with screw-in spikes on the bottom. These help you grip the loose dirt or sand much easier, especially if the course has hills. If you have run on the course before, a watch with a stop timer on it can also be very helpful for knowing when you should start running faster. If it's your first time on a course then this isn't as essential, unless you have a specific time you want to beat.;
, Drink lots of water the day before to stay hydrated. ""Do not"" eat fast food the night before. It can weigh you down and make you feel very sluggish and slow, which can carry over to the following morning. Pasta is the best thing to eat before running. It has sugars that are not only healthy, but gives you energy that will last through the race. If any part of your legs hurt, apply an ice pack and rest. Also stretch the night and morning of the competition. It will help any tightness you feel in your legs and helps prevent injuries.

, Eat a bagel or a egg and no dairy products with water. It won't slow you down and gives you a bit more energy.

, During the race you may feel terrible and very tired. Keep going. You feel a lot more tired then you really are. If you feel yourself slowing down scream in your head ""Don't Slow Down!"" and pick up the pace.

, If you want to win you obviously need to pass other runners. If you see someone ahead of you, make an effort to catch them. If your approaching a turn, make sure to hug the inside of it. If this doesn't get you ahead, it will definitely get you closer to the person you are trying to catch. Your competitors will be thinking the same things as you are; trying to pass you; but don't let them. Don't slow down, or fail to try to keep up because you feel tired. Keep pace with them. Stay at the same speed (preferably a little faster) than them and somewhere along the race try to pass them.

, Hills can be a huge challenge. If the course contains hills do not walk up them! It can add 2-5 min on your time depending on the size of the hill. Take small steps and pump your arms. Your legs will feel like they're on fire, but ignore it and don't stop. Many of the runners will choose to walk up the hill, so it's a good place to gain ground if you are falling behind.

, If it's a course you are familiar with sprint for 15-20 seconds whenever you get to landmark (or at least something that looks important). It will not only help you get farther in the race, but it will give you a confidence boost. If you still have enough energy to sprint you have enough energy to finish the race.

, You're at the end of the race and the finish line is in sight. It's obviously not the time to slow down, so use the rest of your energy to sprint the rest of the way to the end. Don't stop immediately after you cross the finish line. While it may be hard, keep running past the finish line for a few seconds. If you stop right at the finish line, the people behind you might run into you and that wouldn't be good for anyone. Also it can injure your legs if you don't take it slow stopping.

, Run in different locations. Don’t always run around one track, your neighborhood, or on a treadmill. Having a change in scenery can be refreshing and enjoyable, and may allow you to be slightly distracted from running, which will let you forget you're tired. You may want to scope suitable areas out beforehand, just to be on the safe side.

Rehearse yourself through your motivation problem by stating the desired outcome (running half an hour every day); detailing the challenges that your mind keeps coming up with (feeling too tired, worried about unmade dinner, feeling sore, etc.) breaking the challenges up into a series of actions to let you break through the mental barriers.Rehearse running over and over in your mind to bring into line with the way that you act and think. End up by focusing on the good feelings that arise at the end of each running session.Running can be a good time to think about yourself. Try to focus in on certain parts of your life. Tune in to your emotions, besides tiredness. Running can be a good method of meditation and self discovery.
Reward yourself. It's a good idea to treat yourself after a run, to give you something additional to look forward besides the high from exercise. It might be a coffee at a favorite local cafe, or a special show you'd like to watch. Keep it simple and enjoyable.

, Several of the most common injuries that hinder runners can be prevented by stretching and exercises to increase muscle balance. Illio-Tibial (IT) Band syndrome, Patello-Femoral syndrome, and shin splints are all caused by such imbalances in strength and flexibility between different muscle groups. Prevention is possible with proper stretching and simple strength training exercises.

, On the same note, use good running form. Technique can make the difference between a miserable and an exhilarating running session. Advice and feedback from experienced runners is always helpful, and running clubs exist for all levels of runners. Make sure you have proper running shoes, too. Anything that makes running more comfortable is likely to make it more enjoyable. Different people have different needs for support, impact cushioning, etc. Many shops that specialize in running shoes can offer advice on a shoe that will best complement your body and gait.

, Having other people around can help the workouts go by faster, makes it more fun, and will provide accountability to ensure you are keeping up with your workouts.If none of your friends are runners, find a group of people to run with. Check out local stores that specialize in running gear and advice. They will often organize running groups that you can join.
Take your dog running with you. A canine pal can be an enormous source of motivation, with the added benefit that both of you get much needed exercise.

, Another important means for ensuring that you continue to enjoy your running experience is to build in adequate rest periods, to give your running muscles a break. If you are a sporty person, intersperse your running with swimming, bike riding, etc., to shake up the routine but stay consistent with the days that you run. This gives your running muscles a break and helps to keep running an enjoyable activity for you., Know the difference between the usual run-of-the-mill aches and pains that you can push past and real injuries that need attention. Eat well, and sleep well. If you're having a day where your emotional self is really out of whack, think about whether or not a run will clear your mind or just make things worse. Get the balance right, and you'll continue to enjoy running.,"

, Get enough vitamins, and drink enough water. When you're training for cross country, it is absolutely vital that you drink enough water so you do not suffer from dehydration. Be sure to consume an adequate amount of protein within an hour after all workouts.

, Run at least 4 times a week: A repetitions session (at least 3 repetitions, distance totalling just under race distance), a hills workout (4-6 hills), a tempo run (15-25 minutes), and a long run each once a week. You should have 1 or 2 rest days per week, and cross-training at least once a week.

, Run less so that your body has the chance to recover more. You may also carbo load slightly before a race.

, Eat a good healthy breakfast, and be there at least an hour before the race to walk the course, register, and properly warm up.

, Jog for at least 7 minutes and then stretch both before and after your run.

, You won't be allowed to bring water with you on a competitive cross country race.

Fuel your body with healthy food and plenty of water.",How to Be a Good Runner," Your stride is the motion your legs take as they extend and strike the ground, carrying you along. Your natural running stride should feel easy, rather than awkward. Everyone’s stride is a little different, although the general form is similar for most people. Once you find your stride, you’ll minimize your risk of injury and gain speed.


There are several variables you can experiment with. Focus on how high your knees are in relation to your hips. Focus on how your feet strike the ground and how you push off to create your strides. Some people prefer to strike the ground heel-to-toe, while others prefer to do it toe-to-heel. Find what is comfortable and work with what feels best.
Generally, your ideal stride is the farthest distance in between steps that you can make without stretching or straining yourself consistently on a walk or run, but it really depends on your body structure and if you want to run for distance or speed. For a speed workout or race, your stride length should be fairly short, as you have more power with shorter strides. This takes more energy though, and so for a long distance run your stride length would increase. Your body tends to know its default stride length and so from there it's up to you to find out how much you should shorten.
When doing faster, short distance runs one would probably focus more on arm movement. Especially in sprints, where the arm movement essentially determines the speed.

, Another key factor is cadence, or steps per minute. The optimal cadence for a medium to long distance runner is around 180 steps/minute. Many training runners load up music playing devices with music that plays at 180bpm to help align their steps with beats (see How to Create an Exercise Music Playlist). There are some sites that let you sort music by BPM., If you are running on rough trails, you have to adjust your stride to the terrain. Therefore, stride length will vary rather than being a static length.


If on a flat surface that has no obstacles, your stride should be based on what feels comfortable. In other words, a stride that feels like you are really stretching to maximize its length could become very tiring after a certain distance. You could also either experience sore muscles and tendons from over extending yourself. The effort required to maximize your stride length can also be stressful on your feet because you might be springing off each foot and could result in soreness or worse, injury.
If running downhill, you might want to increase your stride length to take advantage of gravity. But again, it needs to be done with caution in order to reduce the stresses resulting from controlling your balance and braking to maintain control.
Your stride length going uphill is going to be shorter than running on a flat or downhill surface, but how much shorter will be relative to the steepness of the hill, along with your conditioning, strength, and endurance. Take very short, slow, and deliberate strides to ""power"" up the hill. The pace might barely be above a walking pace but you'll still be using a running motion, not a walking motion. ""Drive"" your strides with your arms. As you continue training up that same hill, you will be able to run faster and your stride length will increase as you get stronger.

, For example, if you've always been a heel-to-toe person, and you want to try striking toe-first, you should work with a running instructor before you try doing it for long distances. Changing your form can lead to injury.

, Watch the ones who have a smooth easy stride. They appear as though they are almost effortlessly gliding along. The likelihood is those types of runners will finish at the head of the pack.

, If you are running and you can increase your cadence and decrease your stride length, go for it! And when that becomes too tiring, make a conscious decision to lengthen stride and lower cadence.

, This helps stretch out muscles after a hard workout.

, Keep your torso centered over your hips and your back mostly straight, with just a slight lean forward. You don’t want to bend too far at the waist, but it’s fine to lean into your run, especially when you’re going uphill. Keep your shoulders back and your elbows bent, pumping them with every stride.

, Breathe in a way that feels natural and easy. Don’t hold your breath or forget to breathe, or you’ll end up gasping for air and slowing yourself down. In running, as in other types of exercise, your breathing is most efficient when you breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth.

, When you’re just starting to run, any old tennis shoes will do. However, if you plan to run several times a week, and you want to start adding distance, it’s a good idea to invest in a pair of running shoes that fits you well and supports your feet. Your shoes shouldn't be so roomy that they slip around, but you also don’t want them to be uncomfortably tight. Leave about ¼ to ½ inch between your toe and the front end of the shoe.


Most running stores hire clerks who are runners themselves, and are trained to help you find the best fit for your foot. Try on a variety of shoes and test jog them around the store until you find a pair that feels comfortable.
Different shoes are made for feet with different types of arches. For some people, their ankle bends slightly out (under pronation) or slightly in (over pronation) while running, and there are shoes designed to correct these problems.

, If you’re over or underdressed for the weather, your run will not be as successful. A good rule of thumb is to aim to dress for weather about twenty degrees warmer than the actual day’s temperature. That way, when your body warms up, you’ll be able to run comfortably.

, Stretching after your run will help keep your muscles from getting sore. If you wake up tight the next day, you’ll be less likely to run, so it’s a good idea to stretch every time. Do the following stretches after your cool-down:


Bend at the waist and touch your toes. Hold for 30 seconds, then straighten and do it again.
Bend one knee and grab your foot with your hand. Hold it against your bottom for 30 seconds while you balance on the other foot. Switch sides.
Push your toe against a chair or curb so that your foot bends back and your toes stretch toward your shins. Repeat with the other foot.
Roll your ankle for 30 seconds. Repeat with the other ankle.

, They need to move in the same plane as the running direction. The elbows need to be moving in the same plane as the knees. The forearms should be parallel to the ground. The hands cannot be clenched. Avoid clenching the hands by making the ""OK"" sign with the thumb and index finger on each hand. The shoulders, arms, elbows, and wrists must be relaxed, not tensed up. The more the arms are tensed the more the torso gets tensed and the running motion becomes less efficient and you get tired sooner.


It is OK to occasionally drop the hands toward the ground and loosen up the arms like you are shaking rattles, but that is only occasionally just to facilitate looseness.
If your hands look like they are making upper-cut jabs and/or moving side-to-side, energy is being wasted with motions that are askew to the direction your legs are going.

, A lot of people do not realize running takes dedication and consistency if significant progress is to be expected. In other words, if someone really wants to be a runner, he or she must carve out at least 3 days a week (4 to 6 would be much better) if one expects to run comfortably for 20 minutes or more for cardiovascular fitness, personal satisfaction, or even competition. Someone with no running or sports background cannot expect to run 10Ks or half or full marathons on just a few week's training unless he or she doesn't care how it feels the next day.

, If you really want to be a good runner, the best way to improve is to steadily work toward your goals, never taking more than a few days off. If you tell yourself you’re going to run four days a week, 30 minutes a day, make a commitment to do it no matter what. Rain or shine, good mood or bad one, your mission is to get up and run. Slowly but surely, you’ll become a better runner.


It helps to have a set time for running that works with your schedule. Consider doing it before work, so you’ll have it done before your day really gets underway. Or if you want a great way to relax in the evening, schedule in running before dinner.
Plan to run under any circumstances. Say it’s spring break, and you've got a week off of work. You might be tempted to leave your running shoes in the closet, but you’ll feel a lot better at the end of the week if you stick to your schedule. Take your running shoes along, even if you’re going away on vacation. You’ll never finish a run and think to yourself, “I wish I hadn't done that.”

, If you get upset with yourself because you aren't making as much progress as you wanted to, or you’re finding it hard to stay motivated, realize that there’s no reason to condemn yourself. Every day gives you the opportunity to make a fresh start, to get out there again and try a little harder. The more energy you put into becoming a better runner, the better you’ll get. No matter where you’re starting, whether you can run for five minutes or 10 miles (16 km), you will improve if you keep getting out there and running.

, It makes it less grueling if your hands are doing something. Yes, if you are a pro runner this is not the tip for you. You people already know how to keep your hands and intact, if you are a pro runner you probably don't need this article. But for the rest of you, gather around children because occupying yourself is great. Especially if you are just starting out.

, If the prospect of running is starting to feel dreary, and you’re finding that you’d rather do almost anything else, it’s time to mix things up. One of the best things about running as a sport is that it’s incredibly versatile. You can run anywhere, with anyone, at any time, and feel a rush of endorphins without ever needing more equipment than your running shoes. Here are some ideas to add some fun to your run:


Run in a different place. If you always run on a track, find a trail and run there instead. If you always go to the same park, choose a new neighborhood to run around. Even running the same old route backwards can help your run feel fresh.
Listen to music while you run. Make a motivating mix full of songs with fast beats that you’ll be encouraged to keep up with. Do not listen so loudly you are unaware of your surroundings. You should be able to hear cars driving or bike bells. A car horn is too late.
Lose yourself in your thoughts. Many runners use the time to let their minds wander to far-off fantasies. Let your mind go to its happy place, whether it’s planning a weekend dinner party or dreaming about your next vacation. Vacation in your mind!

,, Or... Your mouth! You have two feet so you can chant two syllable words. Candy! Bouncy! Runner!


Run with friends. Some people like to run alone, while others find it highly motivating to run with other people. Find some friends who want to meet up and run a few mornings a week, or join a club or team. You might do it for company, for distraction, or simply for some actual competition!

, Whether you sign up for a 5k, 10k, a 13-miler or a marathon, having a concrete goal will get you up and running in the weeks beforehand. Training for a race is exciting, since it comes with the reward of competing in a race and knowing you were able to finish. After you complete a race, sign up for another one and try to beat your previous time.


Keeping track of their personal best times is a very motivating activity for many road racers. If you find you like the feeling of training and racing, there are hundreds of opportunities to do so every year.

, If you’re just getting started, this method can be a very effective way to help you increase your distance and the amount of time you’re on the road. Try running for a minute, then walking for a minute, then running for a minute, and so on. The next time you run, increase the amount of time you’re running and decrease the amount of time you’re walking. Eventually, you’ll be able to run the entire time.

, Try adding 10 minutes to your run every two weeks. Adding just ten minutes to your time will increase your distance by about a mile (depending on your pace), and after a month or two it’ll really add up.


If increasing 10 minutes every two weeks seems too slow, try doing five to 10 minutes every week instead.
Don’t overdo it, though. Adding too much time and distance too fast often results in injury.

, If you’re happy with your distance and you want to run faster, there are a variety of exercises that increase your muscle mass and allow you to gain speed. Doing these workouts will pay off during your distance runs, when you’ll notice you can cover the same ground in a shorter period of time.


Try hill repeats. Sprint up a hill, then jog down. Repeat for a total of four times. As you gain endurance, increase your repeats so you eventually do 16, with breaks in between.
Try tempo running. This is when you run at a pace that’s faster than normal, but not quite a sprint. Try pushing yourself to run a mile a minute or two faster than normal. As you gain endurance, increase the mileage.
Try track workouts. These involve sprinting short distances with breaks in between. For example, sprint 400 meters (1,312.3 ft) four times, then take a three minute rest, then repeat.

, As you become a more serious runner, you’ll notice how important it is to keep your body in excellent shape by staying well hydrated and eating wholesome food. The difference between a run the morning after eating pizza and drinking beer and the morning after eating salad and grilled chicken is enormous.


Eat whole grains, lean meats, healthy fats and plenty of fruits and vegetables to keep your body in good running shape.
Avoid eating fast food, heavy fried foods, and highly processed foods like candy and snack food. These drag your body down and cause you to run more slowly than usual.

Remember that preparation is crucial.,
Eat a good breakfast (full of fibre, protein ,carbohydrates and sugars) , but make sure you have several hours to digest it or else you'll get a stomach cramp.,

If you do not come first, that's totally fine.",How to Run a Cross Country Race," Hydrate very well and eat healthy the days before the race, and get some good nights' sleep. Prepare yourself psychologically in bed the night before- envision the course in your mind.;
, Be sure to eat a moderate meal 2-4 hours before the race. If you have a slow digestive system, eat light. The objective is to not get a stomach cramp, but also to not be hungry and devoid of energy. Keep hydrating the day of the race, but again, make sure you have time for it to go through your body or you'll get one of those nasty side-aches. Don't drink Gatorade before a race!

, Wearing Racing Spikes is a good idea in the race since they are lighter and have more tread than normal running shoes. Make sure they feel good and not too tight. Having them too tight is just as bad as not having them tied at all.

, Once you lose sight of them, it will be psychologically hard to get back up to them, as you don't know how far ahead they are. But also remember that most Cross Country runners take off too fast, and don't intend to hold their first half mile pace the whole way.

, Also, you will have the added  benefit of running with the adrenaline still in you, so you might as well use it. It not wise to sprint early in the race, rather start with a brisk 3/4 pace to get a good position in the pack. As the runners thin out you will begin to gain on those ahead of you.

, (e.g. a mile mark or a downhill), you may want to try the surge. To do this, run about 60 to 90 seconds faster (per mile pace) for about 50 meters. Then, settle back down to ""normal"" pace. This strategy helps break out of the natural ""slow-down-without-even-knowing-it"" obstacle in a race by overriding the chemical in the brain that automatically shuts down your muscles ""without your permission.""

, As this will make them hurt more. If you run, you actually can't feel them anymore. But if they don't stop hurting, you might want to stop and ask one of the paramedics there if there are any.

, Obviously, since they're attached to your body. You might notice your arms getting a little sore. If they get very sore (your arms), swing them, but minimally. Pump your arms as hard as you can going up a hill, since your legs will be very, very tired going up and pumping your arms will help them go up faster.

, After you catch that kid, make a goal about the kid in front of you and so on.

, When there are people cheering you on, use it as an advantage to boost your self-esteem. Don't ever talk negative to yourself, or you race will end up terrible.

, You may end up passing a couple people and leaving them behind this way. Uphills and other difficult places in races are also good places to leave people behind in races.

, When you are at the last 100-200 meters, sprint and use the rest of your energy to finish.

, Try to do everything you can to get there as fast as you can. Sometimes your legs already know how to do this, especially if you have implanted brains in them that have your legs self-programmed to kick at the end.

, Also, If you don't, the kids behind you will probably run into you and begin to scream obscenities.

, Before you run, remember to stretch. Stretching your body is one of the most important things to do in physical exercises. It can prevent sore muscles or pulled muscles from happening. Before you run, spend 10 to 15 minutes stretching your legs, arms, and back. For instructions on how to stretch or examples of stretches you can do, see articles about stretching.

, It's harder to run in jeans than in basketball shorts or sweatpants. Wear T-shirts made of cotton or sweat-resistant materials. Make sure your wardrobe is not tight, itchy, or uncomfortable. And it's okay if your tee is loose fitting. Loose fit tees are perfect for running.

, Most runners wear a basic pair of tennis shoes, and that's okay. But sometimes if you are running on a trail it's best to use trail shoes. And if you are running on a track, track shoes work perfectly. With your shoes it is important to make sure they fit you snuggly but are not too tight or too loose. Tight shoes may hurt your feet, and shoes that are too loose might slip off your foot. If your feet hurt after you run, particularly the soles of your feet, consider getting insoles. Insoles are easy to put in, and provide extra padding when you are running.

, When running, it's important to drink water. If you are planning to run, bring a water bottle that is all the way full with fresh water. Take a sip right before you start to give you a small energy boost. When you get tired or thirsty drink more water. Refill the bottle if necessary.

, A great way to practice long distance running at first is on a track. To begin your run, get your body moving by lightly jogging (or walking) a lap around the track. Don't wear yourself out right away though.

, After the first lap,(often called a warm-up lap) jog faster. After completing each lap, go a little faster if you are able to.

, Throughout your run, it is important to drink plenty of water. After each lap it is a good idea to take a sip. Refuel when you feel tired or if you are thirsty. If your throat hurts or is dry, it is time to take a drink as well.

, After you get tired of running, walk one last lap. This final lap is called a cool down lap. Cooling down your body is a good habit in exercise.

, When you complete your run, make sure not to attempt any other strenuous physical activities. Rest your muscles if they are sore, and continue to drink water during the day.

You'll need shorts or running pants, shirt, a layer or two if you're headed somewhere high (like mountain trails), a drinking bottle or bladder for water, and some running shoes. If you're running anywhere that could cause safety issues (for example, on a trail also used by cyclists or ATVs etc.), wear a safety vest or bright colors as well. Look for sportswear that breathes well when you sweat and a water bottle or bladder that attaches to you and can be used while you're running. It is recommended that you splash out and buy two pairs of shoes:


The first pair is for practice. This pair should be well cushioned, or else you'll develop blisters or shin splints from the impact with the ground.
The second pair of shoes should be cross country spikes (or flats, if your courses involve paved roads). This pair is for racing. It is a much lighter pair and has thinner cushions for a lower center of gravity. Do not wear these to practice, for they wear out quickly. Also, wearing spikes or flats during practice may lead to an injury because they're not as cushioned as practice shoes.;
, A warm up should be a couple of laps to a couple of miles or slow running or even walking, depending on how long you have been running. A good method is to walk briskly for 5 minutes, then to run at your pace for a few minutes.This will raise your heart rate and cause a sweat to break. After you've warmed up, stretch. Stretching will prevent or lessen your chances of injury.


Don't forget to warm down at the end of training or racing, too. Walk briskly for 5 minutes at the end of your run. Then stretch. It's more important to stretch after you run than before you run. Stretching after you run prevents injuries and works well because your muscles are warmed up and will be at their most flexible, reducing the possibility of pulling them.

, It's a good idea to start slowly and build your strength, stamina, and enthusiasm for the sport. Running hard at the start will likely put you off and cause you to give up. In the beginning, don't tackle seven miles in a single run. Initially, run just to familiarize yourself with how the different types of terrain feel under your feet, and how your body responds to running up and down hills and over rocky, bumpy, uneven surfaces, etc. Don't race at this stage; just get used to running on as many differing surfaces as possible.


Find a suitable place to begin cross-country running. Good choices include local parks (keep off the paved areas), trails in your area, hills, and even botanical gardens if you're allowed to run on the grass and mud! If you can map out the suitable places to run in advance, this will cut down on time spent searching for suitable locations.

, Start with the mile trial. Most runners will ask one another what their best mile time is, so this is the perfect place to start as it will give you an idea of your current pace.A mile is equivalent to four laps of a standard running track and gives you a good indication of your speed, ability, and stamina over this initial distance.


Run at a pace that slightly pushes you but doesn't cause you to struggle; don't worry if you can't do this at the beginning since this is just about defining where you are at the start, and you'll soon start improving. Time the mile run and work out your running pace – it's a pace that is 1 to 2 minutes slower per mile than your mile trial time.Keep running the mile at your initial pace until you feel ready to move on.
Move up to two or three miles or kilometres, and keep working your way up. For novices, runs longer than 10 miles (16 kilometres) will hurt you, for more experienced runners, more than 16 miles (25.7 kilometres) in a run will do more harm than good. Use an easy pace at 2 to 3 miles (3 to 5 kilometres), about 3 to 5 days a week over a few weeks.

, Give yourself permission to take as long as you like to build up your strength, stamina, and interest in this sport. It's not a race to get ready; the race is when you are ready and on the track competing with others. Until then, take it steady and enjoy the training. And don't be afraid to walk in between runs; experienced runners mix running and walking to break down training into smaller chunks and to increase your ability to run for longer periods of time (vital for cross-country running).


Use your lunchtimes to run. If you have access to local parks, waterfronts, hills, etc., near your workplace, take the lunchtime opportunity to squeeze in some learning time.
If possible, find a running buddy. It's easier to team up with someone as keen as you to learn cross-country running. As you improve, the two of you can race off one another during training.
Take care with hill running. Too much uphill running can cause injuries to your muscles and joints, and descents that are too fast can also cause harm. Shorten your stride when running uphill and maintain the effort rather than the speed. Downhill, lengthen your stride a little but maintain discipline to stop yourself from sprinting. Focus on your breathing rhythm on hill runs., Once you've done the training and feel that you're ready to begin racing, look around for suitable races to enter. Pay any necessary fees and make transportation arrangements in advance. It's important to change your training style in the two weeks prior to the race, as you focus on the race itself rather than your standard training. Here are some things to keep in mind in relation to specific race preparation:


If it's possible, try to run the circuit as a practice run before the event; knowing the race well is an important part of not being surprised and of knowing where you'll hit your pain barrier or meet other challenges.
If it's too far away, run equivalent courses in your own area to get yourself ready. In addition, learn all that you can about the course. Check out the enrollment material, look at the relevant websites, and ask questions of other runners on cross country running forums.

, Taper off the training in the last two weeks. In the penultimate week, only do two hard runs. Focus on high quality running. In the last week, only do one hard run, about 3 to 4 days before the actual race.Having lots of recovery periods in the lead-up to the race is extremely important.
The day before the race should be an easy training day (running too hard will cause your legs to be too sore) and be sure to have at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep the night before the race.

, You've done your race preparation and you're ready to prove something to yourself. Keep in mind that the event is a culmination of all your hard work and


Prepare a snack bag and your water needs. Bring a banana to eat after a workout or race. The sugar in the banana will be quickly absorbed by your body, restoring your energy. Also, the potassium found in bananas will help prevent cramps.
Turn up at least an hour before the race. This is even more important if you don't know the area, as you'll want to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the terrain and rules, etc., as well as signing in and meeting officials.
Warm up. Do this at least 10 to 30 minutes prior to the race. Be sure that have plenty of time to stretch before you make your way to the starting line.

, Some people recommend running the first mile of the race hard and fast. The benefit of this is that you can run ahead and keep pace with the top ability level runners, and there will be less people in front of you. This is encouraging and prevents you from being boxed in. On the other hand, other cross country runners prefer to run at their pace from the start, as running out fast can wear you out immediately and lose you time overall.
It's absolutely vital to know your pace and race method before you turn up, although as a beginner, if you're prepared to experiment in the first few races, this can be a good time to find out what works best for you. Find a good race pace for you to use and every race make your race pace a little faster.

, Utilize the experience you've gained training and your knowledge about yourself as a runner to run the race to the best of your abilities. When racing, don't worry about the times and the spectators. You're running this at a pace suited to you and the pain barrier is enough to contend with.


If you get to the top, make sure that you pull away from the rest of the pack giving you a cushion to work with once you enter the final .1 miles of the race, which so often decides the outcome of a race. When you're running ahead of someone else, dart quickly past them to psych them out.
Never look at another racer's feet. Otherwise you risk dropping into their rhythm and falling behind; keep your eyes on their shoulders.

Be proud of your achievement no matter where you arrive in the race. This is challenging running and even participating is an incredible feat!

, Before you begin training in cross-country, be sure to revisit the basics on staying flexible and well stretched. Don't forget to warm up before heading out, and to warm down. You might also like to include some minor weight training and some cross-training such as swimming, cycling, and walking, as these will work other parts of your body as well as giving you a break from running but still providing you with exercise and stress relief.


Additionally, if you're not already running, speak with your doctor about taking up this strenuous sport if you have any fitness concerns. If you're in bad shape, don't give up; just take it more slowly and be very kind to your body as you get used to the running and exercises. The beauty of running is that you will gradually improve your fitness and stamina.

Do push ups and sit ups every day. This will strengthen your upper body, which is also vital in a race. Start with fifteen push-ups and twenty-five sit-ups and work your way up.
You may discover that your calves and hamstrings get a little sore if you're not already a seasoned runner. This is a good thing; it means that you're working the muscle in a way it's never been used before. This is similar to when you go to the gym after a long absence and do a complete weightlifting workout. Of course your muscles will be sore, but that isn't a bad thing! You might want to consider cutting back a little if they are especially sore.

, Your fitness as a cross-country runner also depends on what you're eating. Be sure to eat healthy foods and to provide your body with the high energy input that it needs for running. It's also helpful to eat smaller meals, but eat more frequently throughout the day (maybe 6 - 8 smaller meals every 2 to 3 hours).


Cut down or cut out the fast foods. They provide empty, non-nutritious calories that don't give long-term energy. Instead, fill up on the complex carbohydrates. Eat lots of veggies, fruits, whole grains, and drink water. Also, get plenty of high quality protein.
Before a race, eat lightly. It is recommended that your meal be 2 to 3 hours before a race, and 1 hour before training.Eating any closer to a race can cause you to cramp up.
Drink 230 to 460 ml (8 to 16 fl oz) of water or a sports drink an hour before running.Read up on sports nutrition. It's a complex area with lots of ideas but only you know your own body's needs and can make the right choices for fueling it. Do some research and trialing to see what energizes you the best.

, Once you've trialed the terrain for a bit and become used to running on all sorts of different surfaces, focus on little goals and big goals to help build up your resilience and endurance.


Set a big goal. Now that you've started, it's time to focus on your first cross country race. Which one will it be? Choose one that is coming up and start working toward it.
Start adding one long, hard run to at least one day a week. Do your best to keep running without stopping over a long period of time, such as an hour or two and build it up. Weekends are best for this, although you can also make good use of evenings during daylight savings in the warmer months of the year.
Continue training by observing the easy day/hard day routine. No matter how experienced a runner you are, training should not consist of all hard days. Your motivation and your body will soon wear out! Instead, implement a system of training that allows for some days where the runs are easy and other days where you really push yourself. As a beginner, slowly build up to harder training days.
Keep a training log. This will help you to keep track of your running progress and will enable you to note when it's time to switch up your training to its next level.

, Look online for training program ideas. There are different training programs suggested by different coaches and cross-country runners. Tailor these to suit your local environs and personal needs. The key is to increase your ability gradually and to ensure that you have covered all the bases including different terrain, inclines and declines, all-weather running, increased stamina and speed, and ability to push yourself just a little further every time.

, Cross-country running has both mental and physical benefits; after being a cross-country runner you're likely to be more robust and versatile, able to run in all weather types and across all terrain types.If you're usually a road or track runner, adding cross-country running to your training schedule can ""toughen"" you up and get you prepared for anything. On the other hand, cross country training won't improve just your speed; cross country also focuses on endurance.


Cross country running demands a great deal from your muscles but the gradual increase in strength and improvement of your range of speeds occurs without the jarring that is common with track or road training. This means that you can slowly improve your running skills over time without cumulative damaging effects.Other benefits to cross-country running that apply to running generally include its potential to keep your weight in check; it can be varied between individual goals and competitive goals depending on what you seek from it; your legs will be in great shape; and you'll experience energy increases. , Cross-country running teaches you a lot of self-discipline; even modest running talent is rewarded by good discipline. And despite (or perhaps because of) the challenges involved in cross-country running, you'll have a lot of time for learning how to push yourself in ways you never thought possible.


The end of a cross-country run is filled with the desserts of rewards – you're absolutely and utterly entitled to that hot bath, massage, fantastic meal, and night in a comfortable bed (with the added bonus that you're guaranteed to have an incredibly good night's rest).

, There will be times when you hit a brick wall during training and when it'll be important to take stock and reflect over why you're training. Revisit the reasons that are inspiring you, including the races you want to participate in, the friends you're making by being a part of the cross-country running scene, the enjoyment you're getting out of increased fitness and stamina, and other similar reasons.


If you've been pushing yourself too hard, ease up. Allow time for recovery and remember that you're running for yourself, not for other people. This type of running is about participating and giving your best. It doesn't matter where you come in the races or training, just as long as you're persistent and do your best.
Keep in mind that, as with marathons, cross-country racing is 90 percent mental and 10 percent physical. Make the decision to keep going and to beating your last best.

, Once you're comfortable with cross-country running, and you're able to move away from the high school or college circuits, why not combine it with visiting some of the more spectacular places in the world to go cross-country running? For all the hard work and travel costs, the rewards will include gaining an appreciation for the beauty around you, meeting equally enthused cross-country runners from other parts of the world, as well as having the opportunity to stay in some wonderful places if you're prepared to travel too.


Cross-country running is popular in many countries, including the USA, Canada, Scotland, England, Australia, New Zealand, and a number of countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa.
IAAF Athletics provides ongoing updates of running races around the world, including cross-country running which you can check out to plan which races are of interest to you. Happy travel running!

",How to Be a Good Cross Country Runner," Make sure that you are hydrated, and also not full, but not starving. Running on an empty stomach can be distracting and the lack of nutrients makes your body unable to perform at its peak.;
, A warm-up is always necessary. This should not be very hard, but should be enough to get the blood flowing to your muscles so you’ll be able to stretch effectively.

, It is very important that you make sure your muscles are ready to run. Make sure to stretch your thighs, calves, and hips. A good stretch to do involves walking about ten feet on your tippy-toes and walking back on your heels. This strengthens your ankles so you have less a chance of turning your ankle over on a rock, root, etc.

, Do your workout. A good 1 to 2 or 3 miles (3.2 or 4.8 km) is good.

, Slowly jog 1⁄4–1 mile (0.4–1.6 km) to let your heart rate and breathing return to normal.

, Stretch any muscles that might be sore or that were used excessively during the workout.

, Although this step isn’t typically necessary, it is a good idea to ice any sore parts of your body, for example: hip, calf, knee, ankle, shin, etc. To prevent/relieve shin splints, many runners soak their calves in ice water for 12 minutes after running. The ice water cools off overheated muscles and relieves friction between the bone and muscles.

, Eat a healthy meal and get adequate rest after your workout.

, It's always good to keep a nice steady speed at the end you could sprint to pass someone.

Try going outside of the wake.,
Cut back inside.,
Practice, practice, practice!",How to Slalom Ski (Water Ski on One Ski)," If you can't get up on two water skis, skiing with one will be practically impossible. After you are completely comfortable and have a lot of experience with skiing on two skis, it's time to move on to one.;
, This will be the foot that goes into the back of the slalom ski, as this is the foot that does all of the steering and keeps all the balance. Usually, your dominant foot corresponds with your dominant hand. However, this is not always the case.


To figure out your dominant foot, have someone push you from behind lightly, but hard enough to make you stick out a foot to regain balance. The foot that you stick out in front of you is your dominant foot, and should be in the back of the ski. Make sure that you aren't expecting the push!

, Starting on the bar is a good idea because it lets you figure out how to balance on one ski. Get up on two skis, and drop the one with your dominant foot in it.

You can drop a ski while on the water by pressing down with your toe. Your foot should slide right out. Making the boot a little larger than usual helps get it out easily, and so does dousing the inside with soap before you start. Whenever you want to drop a ski, try to choose a spot in particular so you and the driver knows where it has been dropped. Firstly, you want to shift your weight on one ski (the side you want to slalom on which is your dominant side) After that, try slipping out of your boot. The boot should be usually looser so you don't have to struggle it out. whenever you have your foot out of the boot but still keeping that foot slightly in so when you are comfortable you can completely let go of the ski and take your time to pull back your foot behind and onto the other ski. Do not rush, it's your first time, you want to set up a momentum so that you can do it over and over again.
Once you get your dominant foot out, carefully slide it into the back boot of your non dominant foot. At first, this procedure will be difficult and awkward, but you'll soon be able to do it like it's nothing.

, Now it's time for the next level: the rope.

 You do this the same way as how you would on the bar. It will be tricky to keep your balance, however, if you're comfortable doing this on the bar, this should be a fairly easy task. Once you've done that, it's time to move on.

, This will be the most difficult part of learning to slalom ski.


If your right foot is in the front of the ski, the rope should be on your left. If your left foot's forward, put it on your right. This will help you keep your balance before getting up.
Keep your ski centered. The boat should be going around five miles per hour (eight kilometres per hour), which will help you keep your balance. Once you are certain you've found your inner balance, call out to the driver so they know to start. Have them speed the boat around thirty miles per hour (forty eight kilometres) until you get up and are steady, then gradually slow down to around twenty miles per hour (thirty two kilometres).

, Practice getting up on one ski until you can do so easily. Continue to find your balance point, and practice getting up.

, The next level to slalom skiing is going outside of the wake. You can turn to go out of the wake by using your back foot to lean to the direction you'd like to go in. You'll have to push a lot at first, but with some practice, you'll be able to turn easily with less than a slight movement of the foot. Practice over and over, and cut as hard as you can while going outside of the wake. See how much spray you can kick up with your back foot.

, This is the last level, which expert slalomers are capable of. Once you're outside of the wake, cut as hard as you can back into the wake. At first, you'll go slow out of fear of hitting the wake. Keep practicing, and you'll be able to cut at extreme levels to get back into the wake. You may even get some air while cutting back in!

, Don't go too long without slaloming if you can help it. Continually practice cutting, balance, and other important skills. After a lot of practice, you might even be able to jump, do one-eighties, and other cool tricks. Remember, there's always something else to learn. Go out there and find it!

, Build a good cardiovascular base.


Starting in August, during a regular training week, you should be running at least 5 miles a day at a decent fast pace, a hills workout on Saturday (8-10 miles in the hills is a good workout), and at least 2 tempo runs (20-40 minutes).

, If you feel yourself burning out or getting injured, rest is your friend. During the season, every week you should be taking at least 1 day of rest.

, Learn how to take deep breaths to get the most oxygen to your lungs.

, To prevent soreness and injuries, remember to warm up and stretch before you begin training or a meet. Cool-down by jogging slowly for at least 7 minutes, then stretch.

, Be sure to eat a healthy, balanced diet, and consume an adequate amount of protein within an hour of working out. The night before a race it is traditional to have pasta, as has lots of energy for your body to use during the race.

, Usually meets start in September and run through October and November.

, Be sure to have a fast enough start that you won't be slowed by the pack, but not so fast that you run out of energy. As you run pace yourself don't speed off too fast at the start so your out of breath by time you're halfway. Go at the same pace through out your race until you see the finish line, then go into an all out sprint (if you can't go any faster near the finish line keep your pace).

, It's fine to push yourself in a race, but listen to your body during training.

, Have fun running and don't get all ""I need to beat you!"" This will get people annoyed and it's not a very healthy mindset to be in, anyway.

If you put your left foot forward, you have a regular stance.,
If you put your right foot forward, you have a goofy stance.",How to Tell if You Snowboard Regular or Goofy1," It's easy to tell which stance you have by strapping in and riding (or even just by looking at your bindings). A regular stance leads with the left foot and places the right foot in the rear for steering. In this stance, you turn your neck to the left to see where you're going.;
, On the other hand, the goofy stance has the right foot leading and the left foot steering in the rear. In this stance, you turn your head to the right to see where you're going."

When you're ready, get a running start and jump forward. Try to land on both feet. Let yourself slide forward and come to a stop. Look at your feet — the one you put forward should be the one you put forward on your board.


For example, if you put your right foot forward while sliding, you probably have a goofy stance.
This test has a small risk of slipping and falling, so only do it someplace that's clear of furniture, obstacles, and other people. If you're worried, you can always wear a helmet or try one of the other tests.

, Tell a friend that you want her to come up behind you in a few minutes and surprise you with a gentle shove. Your friend should pay attention to which foot you step forward with. The foot that you stick forward to catch yourself should be in the front when you ride.


For example, if you step forward with your left foot, you probably have a regular stance.

, After a few seconds of pulling as hard as you can, have everyone freeze. Look at your feet. The foot that you put forward should be the one that you put forward on your snowboard as well.


For example, if you tend to put your left foot forward while playing tug-of-war, you probably have a regular stance.

, Walk to the bottom of a set of stairs. Stand close enough so that your next step will be on the first step. Now, start walking up the stairs. The foot you step with first should be in the rear on your snowboard.For example, if you step with your right foot first, you probably have a regular stance.
The tricky part of this test is that it's easy to think about it too hard and use a different foot than you would naturally. Try not to focus too hard on the test — for instance, you may want to bring a magazine so you can read it for a minute to get your mind off the test, then step suddenly.

, Grab a good-sized ball like a soccer ball or a rubber kickball. Hold it in front of you and kick it hard as it falls to the ground. The foot you use to kick should be in the rear when you're on your snowboard.For instance, if you find that you naturally kick with your left foot, you probably have a goofy riding stance.

, If you skateboard or surf, the stance you use for these sports is almost always the same one that will naturally suit you when snowboarding.


For instance, if you put your left foot forward when you ride your longboard, it's very likely that this regular stance is what you should use for snowboarding as well.

Make sure that you know where all the flat spots are before you go on a particular run.,
Gather some speed before you reach the flat spot so you don't have to push, but be sure not to go faster than you can ride safely.

,
Approach the flat spot while riding lightly on either your heel or toe edge, whichever is more comfortable for you.,
Do not let the board go completely flat on snow; once you are no longer gliding on your edge, it is very easy to lose control and crash.

,
Keep your weight centered over the board as your ride and do not twist your upper body, as this can cause you to turn.

,
Switch to the opposite edge (e.g., from heel edge to toe edge) as needed for steering or to relieve fatigue, but be sure to transition quickly and smoothly from edge to edge to avoid losing control.

There are two main styles of standing on the snowboard, both of which are based on your naturally preferred leading leg. Find your dominate leg and plan on using the stance that matches it.If you prefer to lead with your left leg your stance will be considered “regular” stance.
If you prefer to lead with your right leg your stance will be considered “goofy” stance.
If you have a skateboard, then the leg which you push the skateboard with will be the one that will be in the front.
Think about which leg you use first when putting your pants on. Chances are that leg will be your lead leg.;
, Part of staying safe during your snowboarding sessions will require you to wear the best protective gear you can. Wearing protective gear will help shield you from any injuries that can come with falls, collisions, and the cold.Helmets should always be worn no matter how skillful you are at snowboarding.
You will need a snowboard that matches your stance.
A good pair of snowboarding boots will help protect your feet and ankles.
You will need bindings to properly attach the board to your feet.
Goggles or sunglasses can help keep the sun and snow out of your eyes.
Wrist guards can help protect your wrists from injury during a fall while you are learning how to snowboard.

, Because snowboarding necessarily takes place in cold temperatures, you should equip yourself with adequate cold-weather gear. Some essentials include:Having a warm hat that fully covers your head and ears will help keep you warm.
Try wearing thermal socks and underwear.
Have a warm jacket. Many snowboarders like to wear down jackets.
Wearing a scarf or gaiter can help keep your neck warm.
Snowboard pants can help keep you warm and are generally water resistant.
Wearing layers of clothing can help keep you warm., Not all snow is equally suitable for snowboarding. In fact, some types of snow can be more difficult and dangerous to snowboard in. When learning to snowboard always check weather and snow forecasts to make sure you practice in the optimal type of snow.Frozen or icy snow can be difficult and dangerous to learn in. This type of snow will have a layer of ice that is hard and compacted compared to the ideal powdery snow.
Fresh powdery snow is the ideal type for beginners to practice in. This snow will be loose and not compacted, easily moving under your board.
Check the weather forecasts for the slopes that you plan on visiting.

, Ski and snowboard slopes and resorts can be popular places during the winter season. The more people that are on the slopes the more difficult the environment becomes when learning how to snowboard. Try going midweek to avoid large crowds, giving you plenty of open space to learn in., Before you actually hit the slopes for the first time it can be a good idea to learn the trails. Knowing what to expect and which trails or areas to avoid can help you stay safe as you practice your skills. Always take a few moments to orient yourself before snowboarding in a new area.Pay attention to any signs that the course has placed.
Knowing the beginner routes can help keep you out of dangerous situations.

, Snowboarding with a friend can be more enjoyable and make it a safer experience for a beginner. Try asking a friend who has some experience with snowboarding to come with you, offering to supervise you and maybe teach you a few techniques.


Even if your friends are all beginners, having partners can make your first trip snowboarding a safer one

, Your snowboard will have two areas that your feet will strap into. These areas are called bindings and there are a few different styles of bindings available. However, many bindings will have some common elements to them that you should become familiar with.Bindings will have a back plate that will support your ankle and the rear of your boot.
Most bindings will have a strap at the top that covers the upper portion of your boot.
It's common for bindings to have an additional strap at the bottom which will secure your toes to the board.
Always make sure to fully tighten your straps to your boots to ensure you are safely secured to your board.

, Before you can work on snowboarding down any large slopes you should practice simple motions with your board. The first technique you might want to learn is how to “skate” with your snowboard. Practice the following motions in a relatively flat area to “skate” your board and get a feel for the moving with your board:


Strap your front foot onto your board.
Leave your rear foot out of the bindings.
Push with your rear foot like you would using a skateboard.
You will begin to move forward and can put your rear foot back in the binding.

, Many ski and snowboarding resorts will have areas specifically designed with the beginner in mind. When you are ready to try and go down a slope always look for slopes that are marked for beginners as this will help keep you and other snowboarders safe as you learn.Beginner slopes will be very small in size.
Most beginner courses will have very gradual slopes that will let you move slowly and maintain control.

, Once you get a feel for skating your board you can move on to tackling small slopes. Find the beginner courses or areas at your ski resort and start practicing what it feels like to go down hill successfully.Start on a very small slope or hill when first attempting snowboarding.
Keep your point of balance low by slightly crouching.
Try to lean onto your front leg instead of your rear.
Avoid leaning too far to one side or the other.
Don't be afraid to use your arms to keep yourself balanced.
Be ready to fall. Try to spread your weight out over your entire body if you need to fall down.

, Although you should have a good awareness of your total surroundings, keeping your eyes directly on where you want to go will help you control your board. Keep in mind that wherever you are looking your body and board will tend to steer towards., A key part of maneuvering your board while you are snowboarding is managing your body weight. You will need to properly shift your weight in order to turn and stabilize your board. Practice moving your weight while going downhill to get a better feeling of where your weight needs to be when maneuvering your snowboard.Many times your weight will be on your heels, especially when you are going straight.
When turning you will need to shift your weight in the direction you want to turn.
It can help to swing your arms to add extra weight and momentum to your turn.
Commit to the motion. Leaning only a little bit will simply put you off balance and cause you to fall.

, It's very important that you pay attention to those around you when snowboarding. Part of controlling your board is maneuvering safely around other people enjoying their time on the slope. Knowing the rules of who has right of way on the course can help keep everyone safe.Anyone in front of you has right of way over you.
Running into anyone in front of you would be considered your fault.
If you need to pass someone close by you should announce which side you are passing on.
Never stop on the hill or in a place that would make you hard to see.

, Part of learning how to control your movements while snowboarding involves learning to fall. When beginning your practice you can expect to fall down. Learning how to fall properly can help you prevent injury and keep you practicing safely.The most common injury will be to your wrists and hands when falling.
Making a fist when you fall can help prevent your hands from bending too far backwards.
Try to spread the force of the fall throughout your whole body instead of a single area.

, One of the best ways that you can quickly and effectively learn how to snowboard is to take some lessons. Professional instructors are available and can offer their teaching and training techniques to you. Look around your local ski or snowboard courses for either group or personal training lessons to get a good head start with your snowboarding skills., Part of learning any skill is getting in enough practice. Regular practice can help you to maintain your skills and to improve them. Try to get at least some practice in daily to maximize the benefits of your work.Even at home, you can practice strapping into the board and shifting your weight.
Taking your board out into your backyard can allow you to practice basic techniques.
Going to the slopes as often as you can will give you the best opportunity to practice your skills.

, Learning a new skill can be difficult and snowboarding is no exception. When you first begin you may fall often, have a tough time staying upright for a large distance, and may be surround by people who seem to be doing very well. Don't let yourself get discouraged when first learning how to snowboard and keep enjoying your practice time., Once you feel comfortable on the beginner slopes you can start trying more advanced courses. You might also try to increase your speed. Constantly work to develop your skills and comfort level by snowboarding more challenging slopes.


Work slowly when attempting more difficult courses.
Try to increase your speed gradually over time. Don't be in a hurry to snowboard faster.
Always keep your safety in mind when trying some new aspect of snowboarding.

, Once you start to learn the basic movements and skills of snowboarding you can start to learn some tricks. Start by learning some of the simpler tricks, allowing yourself time to work up to more difficult or potentially dangerous moves. Try some of the following tricks to get started:


Do a wheelie by first leaning back on your rear leg. Lift up your front foot and the nose of the board. Hold this position, keeping your balance before lowering the nose of your board.
To perform an ollie crouch down and lean back on your rear leg. Pull your front leg up, lifting the board into the air and begin to move your back leg up to meet it. Land with your board's nose first and use your knees to absorb the impact.

Start practicing snowboarding exercises 6 to 12 weeks before the snow arrives.,
Complete 10 to 15 triceps dips daily to improve upper body balance and strength.,
Do 20 to 30 calf lifts several times a day.,
Strengthen your stomach muscles when you prepare for snowboarding.,
Work your thighs and legs when you prepare for snowboarding.,
Get your heart and lungs in shape to prepare for snowboarding in higher altitudes.",How to Work out for Snowboarding," This will give your body time to build up muscles so you will be ready when the ski resorts open.;
, Getting in shape to snowboard may take some time, so plan on exercising at least 3 times a week for 30 minutes.


Triceps are the muscles located between your shoulders and elbows. You will use your triceps muscles to help you get up or flip your board from heel to toe edge when you are sitting on the ground.
Sit down on the floor. Place your feet flat and bend your knees when you do triceps snowboarding exercises.
Put your arms behind your back with your fingers flat and facing forward.
Lift your bottom off the ground using your arms. When you prepare for snowboarding, you may feel some stiffness or get sore. Better to feel the pain now so you can feel strong on the snow.

, Your calf muscles are located between your ankle and knee, and you use these muscles to help you stop and turn a snowboard.


When you are getting in shape to snowboard, you may hold weights in your hand while you do calf lifts.
Stand up tall and straight, and lift your heels off the ground so you are standing on your toes. Count to 10, and then release.

, You will need strong stomach muscles to get from a sitting to standing position when you snowboard.


Lay on the floor on your back.
Keep your head and arms on the ground, straighten your legs, and raise them 5 inches (12.7 cm) to 10 inches (25.4 cm) off the ground. This snowboarding exercise will strengthen your abs while decreasing your waistline.
Hold this position for 10 to 20 seconds.
Try doing 30 to 100 sit-ups every day to help strengthen your abs.

, To carve down the slopes, you need to have strong legs.


Lean against a solid wall and act like you are sitting on an invisible chair. Hold this position for 1 to 5 minutes. To get in shape for snowboarding, you want to strengthen your thigh and back muscles.
Do 8 to 10 squats every day. Stand up straight with your feet flat on the ground. Lower yourself into a squat, hold for 5 to 10 seconds, and slowly stand back up.

,


Try jump roping. Jump roping is a great snowboarding exercise that can be done inside or out, while increasing coordination and cardiovascular endurance.
Ride your bike, walk or jog outside to prepare for snowboarding.
Training your heart and lungs can be accomplished with plenty of fun activities, including swimming, soccer, skate boarding and hiking.

Once you have strapped in, flip over onto your stomach to stand up.,
Find your balance point, you should have most of your weight on your toes.








,
Slowly drop your heels so that you start moving downhill, never let your heels touch the ground or you will catch an edge.,
Try to shift your weight over each foot to move in that direction, riding a few runs where you just traverse back and forth.








,
Let your dominant foot lead and point directly down the hill, riding for a short distance, and then turn (looking back up the hill) to slow or stop yourself.








,
When going from straight to a stop, don't panic if it does not happen right away.,
Once you have your toeside turns and stops down, start linking with your heelside edge.

The full rundown of snowboarding equipment available is a long list, but these are the basics every snowboarder should have:

A snowboard leash, to prevent runaway boards
Snow pants or a snow bib, which is basically a pair of snow overalls
A snow coat, not too loosely fit
Snowboarding boots, which are specially designed to strap easily into the snowboard
A crash helmet, to protect your head
Thermal layers, such as long johns and wool socks
Snow gloves with gauntlet cuffs
Skiing or snowboarding goggles, to reduce glare and protect your eyes from particulate matter.

;
, In particular, wear your helmet and boots properly. The helmet shouldn't move around on your head, or ride low on your eyes. It should be snug but not too tight. Boots should be tight but comfortable.









If your boots are too big, you can end up over-tightening them and losing circulation in your feet.
Wear thick socks that come up past the top of your boots to prevent the boots (or your pants) from chafing around your ankles.

, This is a grip pad that goes on your snowboard, just above the binding for your back foot. It gives you a place to put your back foot temporarily, for times when you need to move a little ways but you haven't bound both of your feet to the board yet.








, Most snowboards are designed for general use, but if you're more interested in one or another specific aspect of the sport, there are specialized boards that can maximize your experience.










All-mountain or freeride boards are the standard snowboards you'll see everywhere on the mountain. They're great for speed and carving (turning) on a downhill slope, but still short and wide enough to excel at tricks, spins, and catching big air, as well.

Freestyle or technical boards are a little bit shorter and wider than all-mountain models. They're more flexible as well, which gives them superior control for precise movements. Freestyle boards are preferred for riding pipes and technical courses, but are also a good choice for many beginners because of their responsiveness.

Alpine or carve boards are longer, thinner, and less flexible than the other two types. They're built for high speed and smooth carving down the side of the mountain. If a fast downhill experience is what you're after, consider an alpine board.

, Even more important than the type of board you buy is the fit of the board to your body. As a general rule of thumb, your board should come up to about the height of your chin or nose when stood on end. Any lower may be too short; taller is probably too long. The type of board you choose will have some small impact on this.









If you're on the heavy side, pick a board that's stiffer and less flexible to better distribute your weight. Lighter boarders should choose a more flexible board to maximize the amount of control they have over it.

, The only really important consideration for board width is keeping your feet completely on the board. Be sure the board you choose is wide enough that your feet don't jut off the sides of the board. Even a bit of heel sticking out could catch on the snow and mess up your ride.








, As a beginning boarder, price is probably a big concern for you. Rest assured that although there are definite differences in performance between a top-of-the-line board and something basic, you can learn just as well on one as you can on the other.









To save extra money, consider buying a lightly-used snowboard at a swap, or buying a previous year's model of the board you want. These are basically just as good as their current equivalents and can often be had for a much lower price.
Consider what graphics, if any, you want on the underside of your board. If it's something you care about, choosing the right design can help you make a fun personal statement on the slopes.

, You should know which foot you'll be leading with before you head up to the slopes. This will help you know how to set the bindings when you snowboard. An easy way to check your lead foot is to run and slide across a very smooth floor, such as polished concrete or hardwood. Whichever foot ends up sticking out in front of you is your lead foot. Another way to find your lead foot is to stand with your feet squared and have a friend push you from behind. The foot you step forward with first should be your lead foot.









Don't guess. Your lead foot won't necessarily match up with the side of your body you prefer for anything else. Being right- or left-handed, or sliding into base with a particular foot in baseball, doesn't necessarily mean your lead foot will follow suit.
Don't worry. If you find that you prefer not to lead with your lead foot, nothing's stopping you from doing so. Finding your lead foot is just a useful way for most people to figure out which way to stand on the board. It's not set in stone.

, There are two common types, strap bindings and speed entry bindings.









Strap bindings are the most commonly seen snowboard bindings. They consist of a base for the bottom of your boot, and a set of secure synthetic straps (usually two straps) that are tightened over the boot to lock it into the base.
Speed entry (or convenience entry) bindings look similar to strap bindings, except the back of the boot base (called the “highback”) has a hinge that allows you to slide your foot in quickly. Speed entry bindings are common, but tend to be a bit more expensive than strap bindings.
There are other, rarer types of bindings available, but these are not often seen except on high-end boards and particular brands.

, Put your lead foot in the front binding. Fasten your bindings tightly and be sure the base of the binding fits your boot snugly, then repeat for your other foot. Move and bounce around a bit to get a feel for the board.









If the board seems to be on backwards when you look down at it, you may need to have the bindings turned to match your stance. If you're buying a new board, the shop will probably be happy to do this for you for free.
If you feel unstable, your bindings may be too close together or too far apart. Check to be sure your feet are roughly shoulder-width apart to ensure a proper stance.
Check the angle for the lead binding. It should be at least 15 degrees off your line of sight as you stand on the board, to reduce the risk of spraining your ankle when you fall.

, Secure your lead foot in place, but leave your back foot free for now. Once your lead foot is securely bound to your board, put on your snowboard leash to keep your snowboard from escaping down a hill when you step out of it. Leashes come in varying lengths; the most common type is long enough to strap below your knee.









Secure the leash to your snowboard, if it's not already integrated into the binding.
Wrap the leash around your lower leg and secure it snugly. For short wire leashes, attach the other end to your boot lace instead.
Be sure your leash is clearly visible. Many resorts won't allow you to snowboard without a visible leash.

, Push off the snow with your back foot to slide forward on the board like a skateboard, and let the lift chair sync up with you to get on it smoothly.









Your snowboard will dangle a bit from your lead foot as you ride up. This is fine.

, Once you reach the top of the lift, slide off the chair on your board. You'll be on a little hill where you can then turn and make your way to the larger hill. Ride down to the flat area.









If you equipped your board with a stomp pad, it should be easy for you to stay balanced for this part.

, Go to the edge of the hill and sit down with your board perpendicular to the slope. This makes your board act as an extra “brake” to keep you from sliding.









Put your rear boot into its binding. Make sure the bindings are snug and secure.

If you can move your foot while in the binding, or pull your heel up from the base, it's too loose.


Double check your lead foot and leash, and ensure they're secure as well.

, Now that you're strapped in, you're ready to ride. Stand up and turn your snowboard so that the lead end of the board is pointing down the hill and apply some pressure to your lead foot to encourage the board to move forward. Gravity should take care of the rest.









To properly apply pressure, pretend that you're squashing a bug under your lead foot. There's no need to lean forward with your body.
Keep your knees slightly bent and your back straight to maintain balance as you gather speed.

, It's important to know how to control your speed, and turning is the only way to do this while you're on the slope. Besides, you can't really have fun on a snowboard until you can turn on it.









Lean your body into the side of the slope to put weight on one edge of your snowboard. The edge your feet are pointing towards is the “toe edge;” the edge behind them is the “heel edge.”

Try both heel and toe edge turns. Most people have a preference for one type over the other, but eventually you'll learn to use them both.


Redistribute your weight as you turn. Use your arms and torso to further control the weight you're using to turn your board. Maintain a straight back and bent knees as you do this, for safety reasons.

, Come to a near-stop, if you prefer; the important thing is to know how to do it. Being able to stop and restart is key to staying safe on the slopes.









Turn your snowboard so that you're perpendicular to the slope of the mountain. Be sure nobody is bearing down on your position from further up the hill.
Lean back into the slope of the hill as far as you can without falling over. This will put almost your entire weight on one edge of the board, forcing it to slow quickly.
As you lean into the hill, lean back on your rear foot at the same time. This further reduces the effective surface area of the board. The more you lean back, the faster you'll stop.

Don't lean forward onto your leading foot; if you lose your balance in this position, the fall will be much more troublesome than if it happens on your rear foot.


Once you're ready to continue, simply shuffle the board so that it's pointing slightly downward and apply pressure to your lead foot again.

, To turn with both feet in, start your turns with your front foot, then let your back foot follow. This means you go onto either your toes or heels with your front foot first, and then as you get into your turn, you do the same with your back foot.

Be sure not to wipe out.",How to Ollie on a Snowboard," The hill should be large enough that you can build up a comfortable speed, but not so large that you'll lose control. Start at the top and stake out a clear, straight path to the bottom.;
, Point your board in the direction that you want to go, then start down at a moderate speed. Get comfortable with your pace and stay relaxed as you make your way down the hill., To prepare for the jump, make sure your back foot is squarely behind your front, and that your board is still pointed down your chosen route. Once your board is straight and you're moving at a comfortable speed, mentally prepare for your jump.

, Lower your hands and arms as well, making sure to keep your hands parallel to the ground. Make your lowering motion slow and steady, to maintain your balance. , When you jump, you'll be doing most of the pushing with your back foot, so the more of your weight that you distribute to your back leg, the more power you'll get. Also, your front foot will be guiding the board, so you'll want to keep weight off of it for lift.

, Since the board is flexible, bend the tail back when shifting your weight to your back foot. This will create extra springlike energy that will be released when you jump off the ground., Use as much force as possible to ""pop"" yourself upward with your back foot. Lift your front foot first, and lift your arms up high to force more momentum upward. Once you start to leave the ground, pull your knees hard to your chest to gain more height and extra momentum as well.

, Use both feet to level out the snowboard, and make sure that your front foot is still squarely in front of your back foot. If not, adjust in a smooth, careful motion: do this too quickly and you may wipe out. , While it was helpful to have one foot carry more weight in the beginning of the trick, now you'll want both feet to absorb the shock of the landing equally. If not, you risk falling over while you land.

, Let yourself fall to the ground naturally, while staying as relaxed as possible. Let your body absorb the shock by bending your knees and letting gravity pull your body close to the ground. Stiffness or quick movements here may cause you to wipe out, as you may accidentally change your direction or become unbalanced., Carefully raise back up to your starting stance and get your bearings back. Correct for any changes in the direction you're moving and continue down the hill.

, The easiest way to wipe out on an ollie landing is by digging nose of your board into the snow. Correct this by making sure that your board is parallel to the ground as you land, and that you land with the whole length of the board."

Finish strong.",How to Improve Your Chipping," Far to often you see amateurs pull out their sand wedge or lob wedge when they have endless amounts of green to work with. Learning to bump and run with a pitching wedge or even a 9 iron pays off quickly. Obviously, when you have less green to work with go with that SW or LW (even open up the clubface and flop it).;
, For right handed golfers, address the ball in your normal stance, then move your left foot back 6 inches (15.2 cm). Keep your club face aimed at the target (this will make your club face slightly opened). The idea is to open your hips allowing the ball to rise and land softly.

, A golfer may have the right stance but will have bad balance from leaning on his back leg. You need to put 60-70% of your weight on the front leg when chipping. This gives consistent solid contact and avoids 'thin' or 'fat' chips.

, Depending on whether you are playing a bump and run or flopping it, how you finish with the club dictates how the ball will fly. A low finish will cause the ball to fly lower and run further while a high finish accelerates through the shot creating a high, soft ball flight.

Loosen the bolts on your bindings.,
Secure the snowboard in a well-ventilated area with the base facing up.,
Get an iron made specifically for waxing your snowboard.,
Choose a wax that best suits the weather conditions you're riding in.",How to Wax a Snowboard1," Use a screwdriver to loosen the bolts on your board and bindings in order to prevent divots from forming in the board when you run the iron over the base. You do not have to unscrew the bolts completely, just create a level base. This is because the tight screws make a small dimple on the board area and you want a smooth board ares.






;
, You need a flat surface preferably covered in rubber to prevent the board from sliding.








, You can purchase an iron from a snowboard shop. Find an iron with a wide range of temperature settings.









While you can use a regular clothes iron to wax your snowboard, be advised that you will only be able to use the iron for waxing after you use it once. If you try to use it to iron your clothes, you will ruin them.
Additionally, the holes in clothes irons can make melting the wax onto a smooth surface difficult.

, The various temperatures are hot, cold, warm, etc. You can always use an all-temperature wax if you are not sure which type is best for the conditions you are riding in. A cold temperature wax will allow your board to go faster in cold conditions than a warm-weather wax would, for example.








"
"
Clean your snowboard.,
Hold the hot iron above the base of your snowboard and press the wax into it.,
Drip the wax evenly across your board.,
Apply the iron directly to the snowboard base and spread the wax evenly across the board.,
Once you've spread a thin layer evenly over the base, allow the wax to cool for 30 minutes.,
After the wax is dry, use a scraper to remove excess wax and smooth any bumps.,
Use a medium-hard nylon bristle brush to create structure.,
Use a cloth to polish the base.",How to Wax a Snowboard2," Use base cleaner and a rag to remove dirt and debris from the snowboard. You can purchase base cleaner from any snowboard shop.









Any non-polar solvent or citrus oil will work fine for cleaning your board. Some of these include: Orange degrease solvent, Citra Kleen, citric-naptha wax remover, lighter fluid, paint thinner, and kerosene. Use caution when working with hazardous materials and do not smoke around flammable products like kerosene and lighter fluid.
If your snowboard is extremely dirty and in need of a deep clean, you can swipe the hot wax iron over the bottom of the board, rub a thin layer of wax on the board, and immediately scrape it off using a scraper tool.
The hot scrape technique deeply cleans your board and removes any trapped debris.
It is often a good idea to hot scrape your board during or after the spring season as plant debris start to creep onto the snowboard runs.

, Check the wax packaging to make sure that your iron is set at the correct temperature. If no temperature is provided, just be sure that the wax doesn't start smoking when you rub it on your iron. If smoking occurs, turn the temperature down. The temperature should be lower for softer







, Move the iron around as the wax melts so that it drips thoroughly across the bottom of the board. Start by outlining the edges in wax and then filling in the center.








, The wax should be a bit thicker around the edges of the board, however. Be sure to keep the iron moving continuously as you spread the wax. Avoid keeping the iron stationary as this can cause damage to your snowboard.








, Make sure the room your board is drying in is well-ventilated to assist in the drying process.








, Hold your scraper at a 45-degree angle and scrape in long stripping motions from the tip to the tail. Do not scrape horizontally across the short length of the board. You will remove most of the wax during this step, but don't be alarmed. Your board absorbs much of the hot wax and a thin layer produces the best performance.








, Brush from the tip to the tail to structure the base with long, vertical grooves. These small grooves encourage forward momentum when you're riding.








, A shammy works well for buffing a newly waxed surface. Buff in small, circular motions.

,, Soak the rag and give the base a couple of good wipe downs until you don't see any more dirt, wax, etc. being lifted. ***WARNING!!!*** Base cleaner is VERY VERY VERY flammable stuff. DO NOT use anywhere near ANY type of open flame or ignition source. It is best to do all of this outdoors or in a very well ventilated area. Base cleaner will also damage plastic, so keep it away from any plastic, like your snowboard's sidewalls and bindings. Light cleaning such as removing sticker glue, etc., on the board’s top sheet will usually be okay and not cause any damage in my experience.








, from the base. Try NOT to dig all the way down to the wood core because that's an all together different repair that involves a different type of p-tex wax with an adhesive or using epoxy to repair the core damage before applying the p-tex. Re-wipe it down with acetone. Wait a good 10 minutes before proceeding to ensure there are no lingering base cleaner fumes.








,, (Remember to watch your torch so nothing catches fire accidentally.) Hold your metal scraper under the candle's flame and continually scrape all of the black soot from the melting candle before applying it to the repair area. Now, contrary to what you may have been taught, instead of dripping the candle into the repair, it is better to ""paint"" the molten Ptex wax into the repair area using a paint brush, all the while striving for a BLUE flame, and again, continually scraping all the black soot from the burning candle before painting into the repair area. If you DO get black soot in the repair, you can usually just paint it out of the repair. Repeat until all your gouges are filled. Let board cool at least 20 minutes.








, Angle the scraper's bottom edge AWAY from you at about 45 degrees (with the top edge leaning back TOWARDS you) and PUSH it AWAY from you with even pressure, until the repaired areas are all flat. (You can PUSH or PULL the scraper, whichever works best for you, as long as it doesn't jitter, leaving ""speed bumps"" in your repaired area.) Don't worry about any minute scrapes made by the scraper. They are taken care of in the next step.








,,, But, if no tool is available, then hold your file against the side edge at a 90 degree angle (remember, the snowboard is still base up) and use long strokes with an even pressure (not too hard) and use the file from tip to tail(as always with a metal file). Now place the file on the base, across the edge, at a 45 degree angle, making sure the teeth are in the proper position to cut against the base's edge. Again, the key is to use even pressure with long strokes as opposed to short ones that will leave an uneven pattern on the edge. ***Also make SURE you clean the file every 2-3 strokes so no new base damage is created.***








, created by filing. You may have to lightly dig out any filings left in the base to ready it for the second waxing.








, ***IMPORTANT*** Adjust the temperature until any wax wiped on it melts BUT DOES NOT SMOKE!








, Place the iron on the base and start spreading the wax evenly until the base is evenly coated with no dry spots. ***IMPORTANT*** DO NOT leave the iron in any one spot for over one second as the heat buildup will damage your board. When finished let the board cool for a good 30 minutes.

Wear a helmet whenever you are pushing yourself.,
Consider goggles to keep the wind out of your eyes while riding down the hill.,
Dress in layers.,
Keep your hands warm with gloves or mittens.,
Wear warm pants.,
Put on ski or snowboard socks.,
Choose your board and bindings.",How to Dress for Snowboarding," Many snowboarders choose not wear helmets but they are often making a big mistake. While snowboarding, you may catch an edge and you could slam your head on the snow very hard, potentially causing brain injuries. If you're just learning, you're going to fall and you should protect your head. If you're pushing your skills in the terrain park, you're going to fall, and no one wants to bang their head on the rail or land on it after falling twenty feet out of the sky. If you're on a steep trail, there are likely rocks, and if you're in the glades, you really need to keep your head up. If not wearing a helmet, definitely bring a wool hat.






;
, Different lenses are useful for different times of the day. For bright conditions during the day, you want a dark lens or a mirrored lens so that it protects your eyes from the sun. If you like to go fast, or it's windy or snowing (or they are making snow), a clear lens works well at night. If you aren't wearing goggles, you'll find it very difficult to snowboard behind people, as they pick up snow with their skis and spray it in your face.








, Layers are the key to matching the environment around you. Bring at least one extra in a bag to the ski area. If you're hot, take one off, conditions can and will change while you're on the mountain. A breathable waterproof shell is also very helpful.








, Cold days demand thick gloves or mittens. On warmer days, thin gloves will work much better.








, Though not too attractive, thermal underwear works very well. Over that, you should wear breathable waterproof snow pants. Waterproof is a big asset, because if you are a beginner boarder you will spend a lot of time with your butt in the snow, which will cause an uncomfortable wetness on your behind.








, This is one case where layers don't work. One pair thick socks is ideal. Two pairs of socks actually makes your feet colder in tight-fitting snowboard boots (which your boots should be). Consider boots with a removable lining for the most warmth. Remember to pull your socks up as high as they can go, or the top of the snowboard boot will irritate your skin.








, Your board size will vary by weight and preference. If you're renting, there will be someone there to help size you; if you're buying, the clerk will help you out too.

Check for boot-binding compatibility.,
Measure your stance width.,
Choose your stance style: Stances includes the duck, alpine, or forward stance.,
Place the bindings on the board.,
Set the front binding in the direction you are riding at an angle.,
Screw the bindings in hard.,
Set your forward lean on the highback.,
Strap your boots in.",How to Mount Bindings to a Snowboard," If you mix Burton bindings (3x3 holes), with a non-Burton snowboard (4x4 holes) you may need a special plate that comes in the box with Burton bindings. Burton uses a 3-hole pattern, while other brands use a 4 hole pattern. The plate will make sure your gear will mount correctly.






;
, Typically, you will want to have your feet shoulder width apart. For the average male, this is around 1/3 of your height or 20 inches (51 cm).








, This wikiHow assumes you are using a standard, regular stance.








, Locate them your measured stance width apart. While most people will want the bindings centered, you may modify this as you see fit.









On a powder day, you may want to move your bindings back towards your rear foot so that your nose tilts slightly up allowing you to float above the powder without needing to lean back.

, For example, if you are riding regular (i.e. right foot in back), you can set the front (left foot) binding facing forward to an angle usually 15-20 degrees. The rear (right foot) binding is usually set to 0 degrees.








, Tighten the screws. Return to tighten all the screws again. Loose screws will give you a hard time or even cause an accident.








, In order to do so, you have to play with the tab at the base of your binding. While there is no rule how to set this, forward leans of 10-15 degrees are common. Use trial and error to find an angle comfortable for your knee and that still lets let you bend enough to keep your balance.








, Check your straps for safety. Tighten your straps to ensure that your boots don't move. The goal is to tighten the straps as much as possible without constricting your blood or hurting your feet. You are now ready to ride.

Choose boots that fit comfortably without constricting your feet.,
Choose an ""all-mountain board"" for beginners or riders who want a bit of everything.,
Choose a ""freestyle board"" if want to do a lot of tricks.,
Choose a ""freeride board"" if you do a lot of downhill riding.,
Choose a ""powder board"" to ride smoothly in fresh snow.",How to Choose a Snowboard," Snowboards are usually measured from tip to tip in centimeters. To size a board, place the tip on the ground and stand the board up to your face. -- the top of the board should reach your chin.However, there are a lot of benefits buying a shorter or longer boards. In general, shorter boards are more maneuverable and longer boards are faster.


Beginners should choose a board on the longer end -- one that reaches their nose when stood up, for example.
Heavier riders should consider slightly longer boards to distribute their weight.;
, On the back of every board is a weight classification, so get the right board for your body. If you're too heavy you could break the board, too light and you will have trouble maneuvering.

, The width of a board needs to fit your body, and most people will be fine with a normal board width of 246-255 millimeters. Your snowboarding boots should barely hang over the edges of the board when you stand on it, with no more than an inch of your toes and heels sticking out on either side. Generally, those with a US men's size 11 or US women's size 11.5 shoe and larger should get a ""wide"" board (250+ millimeters). If your foot is smaller then a men's 7 or a women's 9 you should choose a narrow board (235-245 millimeters)., These two measurements tell you how easy it is to turn a board, and you may see them listed on some boards. In both cases, the smaller the number, the easier the board is to turn. Beginners can ignore shortcut radius at first, as basic boards usually sit somewhere in the middle.



Shortcut Radius: This is the measure of how big a circle you board would make if the curve of the edge was extended to a complete circle. The smaller the number, the smaller the circle.

Waist Width: This is the measure of the board at it's thinnest point. The smaller the waist width the faster the board reacts to your turning motions., Boards are either directional or twin-tip. Directional boards are built with one front end and are made for speed and stability going down hills. Twin-tips have identical front and back ends -- perfect for stringing together tricks at the terrain park. It is easiest for beginners to get twin-tip boards to eliminate mistakes.


There are also ""directional twin-tips,"" which are hybrid shapes designed for any rider.

, Once upon a time, all boards came in the same shape. No more. Today, there are a variety of designs for different riders known as camber. This corresponds to the profile of the board, or what parts touch the ground. Consider renting 2-3 types of board before buying to see what camber you prefer. (Note: Camber refers to the general style of the board (camber type) and a specific style of board.) Different camber types include:



Camber Board: The most common board, cambers touch the ground near the tips but curve up in the middle. When you stand on the board you push the center down, but it retains some of the pop for jumps.

Rocker: The opposite of camber boards, rockers curve down. This keeps you tips out of the snow, increasing maneuverability.

Flat: Exactly what it sounds like, flat boards curve up slightly at the tips but are flat throughout. While flat boards are vulnerable to caught edges in the snow, this shape is the easiest to turn and floats well on fresh powder.

Hybrid: Many companies have started to mix and match the camber, rocker, and flat boards, making shapes for any rider. Boards like the ""rocker/camber/rocker,"" for example, can handle a variety of situations and terrains., There is no consistent rating system for flexibility, so a 5 from Burton might not be as stiff as a 5 from Evo. Still, most companies use a 1-10 rating system, where 1 is the most flexible and 10 is the least. The stiffer the board is the faster it moves, but flexible boards are easier to turn.Soft, flexible boards are best for beginners and trick riders because of their maneuverability.
Stiff boards hold edges, speed, and turns better and have greater stability at high speeds.

, There are several types of binding mounts, differentiated by their placement on the board. The most common are 2x4 and 4x4, which are simply 2 rows of spaced holes for mounting bindings. More complex systems, like the Burton 3D insert pattern, can help you attach any type of binding to your board. Check you bindings to see how they attach and match this to your board.


Standard bindings attach to any 2x4 or 4x4 pattern.
Specialized bindings like the Burton 3D Disk or Burton EST are made to only attach to the Burton 3D pattern., Newer riders should aim for short, flexible binding backs (the part behind your heel). This allows them to feel comfortable and in control. However, performing precise maneuvers or turning at high speeds is much easier with high, stiff bindings.


Freestyle riders and trick riders usually like flexible bindings because they make landings easier on jumps.
Racers and riders who prefer thick, fresh powder prefer stiff bindings for control in deep snow., There are a variety of methods to securing your feet to bindings, from straps and cranks to quick-entry speed bindings. Neither method affects your riding very much, so choose the system that your prefer.

, You want to shop for snowboard boots much like you shop for any other shoe. Make sure that you have room to wiggle your toes and your heel stays firmly in the shoe as you move around. If you feel any rubbing or pain, try a new size.


Make sure you try on snowboard boots with appropriate, thick winter socks. These will add up to an inch around your foot, which will make a big difference as you try to squeeze them on at the mountain.

, All-mountain boards are equally at home heading down the mountain and hitting jumps at the terrain park. They blend speed and maneuverability well, and are thus the perfect board for beginner riders or someone who wants to board downhill, half-pipes, or backcountry in the same day.



Size: If you stand the board up on it's end, the top should reach between your nose and chin.

Directional Twin-Tip This hybrid shape can comfortably ride with either direction facing forward, but the front end is often tapered up slightly to make it faster downhill.

Camber Type: All-mountain boards usually come in camber shapes which curve upward. However, beginner riders should try a rocker-style because of the added maneuverability and turning forgiveness., Freestyle board are usually smaller so they don't get in the way during tricks. They are highly maneuverable and light, but they have less speed and stability when going downhill. That said, they can still be used to to bomb down a mountain in a pinch.Size: Since freestyle boards are usually smaller, choose one that feels comfortable to you. Stand the board up and look for something that reaches between your shoulder and chin.Twin-tip: Freestyle riders will almost always want a twin-tip design, as this allows them to comfortably board in either direction after jumps or tricks.

Camber Type: Most freestyle riders prefer a ""camber"" shape, where the board curves slightly upward between the tips. This spring-loads the board to give you maximum pop on jumps.

, These boards are made to be quick and stable at high speeds. They are generally stiffer and have the bindings slightly set towards the back of the board.



Size: Usually the longest board type, a freestyle board will often reach near your forehead when stood on end.

Directional: All freeride boards are directional, meaning there is a designated front end to increase speed.

Camber Type: Freeride boards come in a variety of shapes, but one of the most common is a rocker/camber/rocker hybrid that curves down near the tips and up in the center.

, Powder boards are usually made for downhill riders who encounter a lot of fresh, soft snow. They have longer or tapered noses and raised ends to help stay on top of powder. The bindings are generally set towards the back of the board to keep the front end up.



Size: Generally longer to increase surface area and speed, since powder boards are not often used for tricks.

Directional: Most powder riders prefer directional boards, since the design allows them to sail smoothly over fresh snow.

Camber Type: Powder boards usually have a rocker-shape, which is when the entire board curves slightly upward. This keeps the tip and tail elevated so it doesn't get caught in the deep powder.

Know what it is and when to use it.,
Tee the ball and position your feet.,
Grip the left side of your club firmly.,
Stand the correct distance from the ball.,
Aim left and complete your normal backswing and downswing.,
Emphasize your backswing.,
Focus on a descending strike by slightly leaning the shaft forward.Average golfers often come over the top of the ball when attempting a power fade as they hit from out to in, which creates a weak pull-slice.,
Swing along your body lines.,
Use a coat hanger to correct a megaslice.",How to Hit a Power Fade," A power fade is when you purposely drive the ball and the ball curves from left-to-right from the tee. The ideal time to use it is when there is trouble on the left of a hole, forcing you to turn to the right. A power fade may be easier than hitting a straight drive.A shot may have the same movement because the clubface was accidently left wide open upon impact or when you slice the ball, accidentally cutting across its face.You may also use the power fade when your tee shot already has a left-to-right curve but, during the curve, the ball loses momentum. You may also use the power fade for a consistent shot off the tee.;
, Place the ball on the right of the tee box. Give yourself more room for your drive to move to the left before curving towards center. Place the tee one ball width ahead of your normal stance. Align your stance to a location between the troubled section on the left and the center of the fairway.This alignment is going to be the line your shot will follow before it moves towards center.Your body, feet, hips and shoulders should be in the direction where you want the ball to start off, which is towards the left of the green. Your club should be aimed toward the pi, which is where you want the ball to end.Keep your tee low. Line the equator of your ball with the sweet spot of your club. Keeping the tee height low encourages your swing to stay level through impact and discourage a pull hook.
Placing the tee slightly ahead of your stance and lower than normal forces you to hold your release which keeps the face open., You do not want the club face closing over on impact. Use the last three fingers to create a strong grip on the left side. This grip ensures your swing stays open as the swing goes through passed impact., The distance between you and the ball determines whether your swing will be flat or upright. As you move away from the ball, your swing will be flat; in contrast, your swing will be upright the closer you are to the ball. If you want to drive the ball a greater trajectory, stand further away from the tee.The difference in your swing plane and the degree that you rotate your clubface determines the shape of your swing. Choke down on your club if you're standing closer to the the tee. This will lower its trajectory., Your setup determines the movement of the ball so employ your backswing and downswing as your normally would. Aim for the left quadrant outside of the ball. This increases your chance of having it fade back to the center line.Don’t try to hit the ball with all your force and focus on technique. You may be prone for more mistakes, like hooking the ball, the harder and faster you swing., Keep your shoulders at 90 degrees to your target line to create a lot of torque in order to increase the distance of your shot. Improve the turn in your backswing to create separation between your shoulders and hips during your downswing, which creates the torque needed for increased speed. After you complete your backswing, first unwind your lower body and then whip your club through impact., Hit from the inside by rotating the clubface a few degrees to keep it open., Your setup should have your club face aiming straight at your target while your body -- feet, waist, shoulders -- is shifted to the left. Keep your clubface where it is and swing as if you’re trying to hit the ball to the left.


Because you’ve kept the clubface facing straight towards the target, the ball will move back on your line. Your setup produces your ball flight, not your swing., Beginner golfers often create a ballooning megaslice because their clubface is open upon impact. Correct this issue by practicing with a coat hanger on the lead side of your grip so that it touches your forearm. Make sure the coat hanger remains touching your wrist during your backswing and all the way through impact.You cannot get rid of a slice without working on the open face of your club. It doesn’t matter how much you work on other factors like flight path.Cupping your wrist causes the coat hanger to move away from your forearm and for the face of your club to be facing forward at the apex of your backswing. You want to correct this issue. Flex your wrist so that the coathanger remains touching your forearm throughout the full range of motion prior to impact. The clubface should also be facing the sky and parallel to your forearm at the apex of your backswing.Go slowly to focus on your technique as you practice this drill. Rehearse as many times as you need in the driving range until you no longer need the coat hanger."

Make sure you either use a Pitching Wedge or a Sand Wedge to practice your pitching with.,
Hit down on the ball to get the ball up in the air.

,
Make sure that when you address the ball, the end of the grip, or the ""butt"" of the club as it's called is pointing left of your belly-button and the ball is positioned opposite your left breast.,
On the backswing, create a good 90 degree angle between the left arm and the shaft of the club as soon as possible.

,
Try to get the clubhead higher than the hands as early as possible, then when you swing the club back to the ball, try to hit down on the ball with the shaft leaning towards the target.

,
The Law of Opposites will come to your rescue.,
At impact you should try to keep both arms fairly straight until you feel yourself being pulled round towards the target.

,
Try to move the club and arms together.,
Try not to force your body into the shot.,
You should find your shots flying up in the air and hopefully landing on the green.",How to Hit a Normal Pitch Shot," These have lots of loft. If the ball doesn't go as far as you would like it to, then you could also use a 9 iron.;
,, (With a slight lean of the shaft towards the target, you will be able to hit down on the ball much easier than if the end of the club was leaning away from the target or more towards your right leg.)

,,, If you can remember to hit down on the ball, then the ball will go up in the air. If on the other hand you try to ""scoop"" or ""lift"" the ball up into the air, the ball will not go up, rather it will go down!

,, Let the body respond to what the arms do. Provided you have a good posture, your weight shift will go over to the inside of your right foot and then when you start to swing back towards the target you should find your weight going over onto the left leg.

, If you find your body moving too much during the swing, simply try to swing the arms faster. This will at least give you a better chance of maintaining your balance.

, Keep practicing and hit it with passion!

"
"
Use your highest lofted club (60 degree wedge is ideal).,
Execution: The length of your swing will be in proportion to the distance you need to hit the shot, but in general, this stroke needs to feel long and smooth (as opposed to sudden or quick).,
The pace of your swing should be constant.,
Keep the clubface open throughout the swing.,
Swing left (if you are a right-hander).",How to Hit a Flop Shot in Golf," Pre-shot preparations: The ball position for this shot is forward in your stance. You'll need to experiment but play it as far forward as you can stand. Open the clubface and open your stance. Light grip pressure is best.;
, The swing doesn't need to be extremely upright.

, Feel as though your through-swing is moving at the same pace or tempo as your back-swing.

, Make sure the clubface is pointing toward the sky after impact. Monitor the back of your left hand (if you are right-handed) and make sure it points to the sky after impact.

, Do not try to swing at the target. Your stance is open so your body-lines are all aiming well left of the target. Swing in relation to your body lines, not toward the target.

Be prepared for a day of not playing golf!,
Explain the rules, namely golf etiquette.,
Realize they won't look at the ball when they swing at it, so they sure won't see where it goes.,
Expect questions.,
Avoid keeping score.,
Always tip the cart girl.,
Be compassionate.",How to Golf With a Beginner," If you are an avid golfer who doesn't care about a beautiful day, exercise, or just getting some fresh air, this is a waste of a day. So just be prepared. As an avid golfer one knows or should know, you play to the level of your opponent, so on this day your game will suffer. If you don't have much patience then you are in for a long day. Use a course with a beverage cart, or stop by a package store before you begin.;
, Speed of the round being the most important topic. Hopefully you will get to explain this before the first tee. With their excitement, nerves, and anxiety; they will not retain much if anything so stress on the speed of play.

, Keep a close eye on where their ball goes. When this inevitably occurs, have them drop the ball out in the fairway, or better yet up by your ball. The closer you can get them to your ball, the faster the round will go. Four or five hacks till they get to your ball will definitely slow the round.


Don't make them hit the ball where it lies, always let them improve their lie. Avoid trouble at all cost.

, Another certainty is ""what am I doing wrong?"" Two things that are useful to say are ""keep your eye on the ball"", and ""just whack it"". Or, ""get some lessons"". Much more than that will clog their mind and end up making things worse.

, Score is of no avail in this outing. Your own will be higher than normal and there is really no need to keep the beginners at this stage of the game. Try to get them to concentrate on making a few good shots and be happy about that for now. Have fun.


If they insist on a score, then triple bogeys are the highest they should ever get. Not only will that make them feel better, but it will influence them to pick up rather than hacking 12 or 15 shots a hole.

, You want her to follow you around for the day. And she could literally round the course for each hole you play, at the pace you will be playing.

, The biggest thing to remember is some schmuck had to sit through your beginnings and look where you are today. And who knows, if they take to it like you did, in a couple of years you might have a fun golf partner.

Determine how good / bad you are.,
Determine a realistic goal - and commit to it.,
Putting is the skill that will separate an advanced player from a recreational player every time.,
Keep score next time you play.,
Take a look at the numbers.,
Practice now - whether you need to practice drives or putts - go do it.,
Take a measuring tape and mark off 10 feet (3.0 m), 15 feet (4.6 m), 20 feet (6.1 m), 25 feet (7.6 m), and 30 feet (change your scale as to your skill level).,

Disc Golf - The only Sport You'll Ever Need!

",How to Get Better at Disc Golf," A good resource for this would be the PDGA (Professional Disc Golf Association) website. Look under membership / classification. The key here is to look and see where you may rate. A recreational player will make 30% - 50% of 20 feet (6.1 m) putts, and drive 150 to 300 feet (45.7 to 91.4 m). An intermediate player will make 50%-70% of 20 feet (6.1 m) putts, and drive 200 to 350 feet (61.0 to 106.7 m).;
, Perhaps you have an underpowered 150 foot (45.7 m) drive. This is a significant disadvantage over an average player who will launch the disc 250 feet (76.2 m). If this is you - focus on improving the distance of your drive. If you can drive over 200 feet (61.0 m) - then you need to become an expert putter.

, It is the single best area to focus on to take strokes off of your game. To determine what the impact could be on you game - do some tracking.

, When you record your stroke count, put beside it the number of feet to pin you were away when for the stroke before you made it in the basket. So, unless you make a deuce or an ace, every hole should have a distance in which you missed what could have lowered your score by 1 stroke.

, Do you have any at all below 20 feet? This you can correct in a week or two of practice. What about below 30 feet? A good player will make over 70% of putts below 30 feet (9.1 m). Are you really good?

, Make yourself go out to a vacant field or soccer field, and practice 100 drives. Before going - go to You Tube and check out the instructional help videos created by Discraft. (search for disc golf)

, Use rocks or discs or minis to mark the distances. If you feel really brave, take a hoe and some bricks and install permanent markers.

Choose your bindings.",How to Buy a Snowboard," There are three basic skill levels of snowboarding: beginner, intermediate and expert. A pro might also be considered a fourth level in terms of experience. Many snowboards are made for specific experience levels and the description will usually tell you which level the board is made for.


Beginner snowboarders are those who have never snowboarded previously or are still moving slowly down a run.
An intermediate snowboarder is one who is more solid on their feet, can ride toe and heel edges, might be starting to ride switch and might be beginning to ride a little in the park or advance their riding in other ways.
An expert snowboarder will have strong confidence while boarding, can adapt to elements and conditions and can ride the steepest terrain while maintaining control.
A pro is someone who has been snowboarding so much that they are more comfortable on a snowboard than they are walking on their two feet.
Factor in your progress when purchasing a snowboard so that you do not progress past that experience level too quickly.;
, Types of snowboarding styles include freestyle, freeride, all mountain, powder riding and backcountry. The style of riding has a major effect on the type of snowboard that should be purchased.


Freestyle riding includes tricks in the terrain park or on the mountain such as jumps, riding rails and boxes and the halfpipe. Freestyle boards will be a bit shorter with a soft flex.
Freeride means snowboarding around the runs with long, deep carving, higher speeds and natural terrain. Freeriders will typically choose a positive camber board for more edge control and a board with a directional shape.
All mountain riding is freestyle and freeride combined. Boards for all mountain riding should have a twin directional shape, a 5 flex and length according to which style of riding you do more often.
Powder riding is for those snowboarders who hike in the backcountry to find big mountain lines. This type of riding is done only by experts or with the supervision of an expert. Boards for powder riding will be stiffer and longer with different cambers specifically designed to get better float on top of the snow and for more control.
Split boards  are designed for backcountry use because they break down into two separate halves for touring and uphill travel but can be reconnected for normal downhill riding. They require special bindings., There are four types of shapes of snowboarding boards: twin, directional, twin directional and tapered. The shape descriptions are based on the length and width of the nose and tail.


Twin boards are symmetrical on each end of the board, meaning that the nose and tail are the same length and width. They are designed for beginners and freestyle riders because they can be ridden in both directions, or regular and switch. These will also be good for kids.
Directional boards are for one-way use with a longer and wider nose than tail, giving more suspension and performance in that direction. This type of board would be more useful for a freerider.
Twin directional boards are a mix in terms of shape between twin boards and directional boards. They are designed for all mountain freestyle riders because they provide stability at higher speeds and for carving but also allow for switch riding and freestyle terrain use.
Tapered boards are more extreme versions of a directional board. The nose will be much wider than the tail in order to give the board more float in powder. This type of board is designed for powder riding.

, Flex is what determines the softness or stiffness of a board. The correct flex for your board depends on your ability and riding style. Flex is measured on a scale of 0-10 scale with 0 being very soft and 10 being extremely stiff. Some boards will also have variable flex throughout the board for particular uses.


Beginners (including kids) and freestyle riders will use a board with a softer flex because they are easier to press and will not catch edges as quickly. They will be more responsive to your body movements, making it easier to switch edges and control your board.
All mountain riders will use a board with a mid-range flex for all types of snowboarding.
A stiff board is useful for high-speed snowboarding, freeriding, powder riding and in the halfpipe. They are used for greater stability, preserving energy on powder, higher speeds and big air maneuvers.
Freestyle boards will sometimes have more flex in the center of the board with more stiffness at the nose and tail.
Freeride boards will sometimes have a stiffer tail to help the rider through uneven terrain and give the board a little pop. The same is true for halfpipe boards.

, Boots are the most important aspect of your snowboard in terms of comfort. They are also designed for performance and can enhance your riding if you choose the correct ones. Boots vary according to their flex and are chosen according to your riding ability and style.


Soft flex boots are the most flexible boots and are perfect for beginners and kids because they are easy and comfortable.
Medium flex boots provide more power in turns and quicker reaction times so they are better for more experienced riders.
Stiff flex boots are used in the halfpipe and by freeriders for carving fast and hard. They provide excellent turn initiation and extra power and protection for use in the halfpipe.

, Boards are measured in length from tip to tail and this length has a big effect on performance. In general the height should be between your shoulder and nose when standing. There are a few characteristics that determine the exact length your board should be within this range.


If you are a heavier person, you should choose a board that is a bit longer. If you are lighter then you should get a shorter board.
If you are a freestyle rider, a beginner or a kid then you should choose a shorter board because they are easier to control, spin and turn. A shorter board would come up about to your Adam’s apple.
If you are a free-rider  or powder rider then you should choose a long board that comes about to between your chin or nose. Some might even choose longer boards. A longer board will give more stability at high speeds and more surface area on top of the powder.
Shorter boards are better for kids because they are easier to control. However, kids are also always growing so it may help to choose a board that is a bit on the longer size for their height so that they can grow into it instead of growing out of it too quickly. For kids, choose a board that is closer to the chest for those who are beginners, are cautious, are lightweight and/or like to make short quick turns without riding fast. Kids who are riding fast and aggressively, weigh more for their height or are growing quickly should choose a board closer in length to their nose. Do not choose a board longer than this or it can hamper their learning and the amount of fun they have.

, Once you have your boots you can determine the width of board you would need. Ideally your shoes should extend over the edges of the board by ½-1 inch (1-2.5 cm). This way you can control the board easily when changing edges but will not have your toes and heels dragging in the snow as you carve.


Most people with a US men’s size 10 (Euro size 43) will be fine with a regular width board.
Those wearing US men’s size 10-11.5 (Euro size 43-45) will probably need a mid-wide board.
Those wearing US men’s size 12 (Euro size 45) or larger will probably need a wide board.
If your feet are US men’s size 14-15 (47-48) then you will need an extra-wide board.

, A snowboard plus boots and bindings will cost from $450-$1000 and up depending on the style, materials and design. The cost of your board will depend on your budget and ability level so it is a good idea to figure your budget out before heading to the store.


Entry level boards will cost in the range of $150-$250, with boots costing around $140 and bindings costing around $150.
Mid-range boards will cost between $250 and $450, with boots costing around $200 and bindings costing around $200.
Top end boards will cost $450 and up, with boots costing $300 and up and bindings costing $250 and up.
Kids boards can be purchased used to save on costs but the board should be good quality without nicks or damage.

, Most snowboards are made out of wood, although some high-end boards are made of synthetic materials such aluminum, honeycomb or fiber base. The wood core will then be surrounded by fiberglass and topped by a sheet containing the graphics.


Cores can be constructed in different ways with higher quality boards using several layers of wood to strengthen them. The core can also be made with wood grain running in different directions in different areas of the core to increase strength and promote edge grip. All cores are vertically laminated and most are laminated from tip to tail. However, some less expensive boards will use plastic spacers at the tip and tail instead of having wood go all the way through the core.
The fiberglass surrounding the core determines the stiffness of the board. Beginner and freestyle rider board will have a single layer of fiberglass weaved in a single direction for more softness and flex. Stiffer boards will have fiberglass laid in multiple angles to increase stiffness and durability. Higher quality fiberglass will also be lighter weight than lesser quality fiberglass. A snowboard should be as lightweight and strong as possible.
The top sheet contains the graphics and can be made out of wood, fabric or a material made out of beans. They can protect the fiberglass and core from damage but should not be integral in your choice of a board., Snowboard bases are either extruded, meaning the polyethylene pellets have been melted down before being forced together under pressure, or sintered, meaning the polyethylene pellets are forced together under extremely high pressure without being melted first. The graphics can be applied to bases using screen-printing, sublimation or the die-cut method.


Beginner, intermediate and freestyle boards will usually use extruded bases because they are cheaper and easier to repair in case of damage. Extruded bases can be waxed using rub-on wax or a hot wax every 8 times out on the mountain.
Sintered bases have pores in between the pellets, meaning they can absorb more wax and are therefore much faster. They will need to have hot wax applied every 3-5 times out on the mountain. Sintered bases especially need to be waxed often to maintain their performance.
Screen-printed graphics have been applied directly onto the base in layers from the bottom up to the core. This is usually used on extruded bases.
Sublimation is when the graphic is printed onto paper and then uses heat and pressure to transfer the ink from the paper to the base. A second layer is then applied in the same way and then the base is attached to the board with epoxy.
Die-cut is when the colors are cut out and inlaid next to each other. Because there is no ink added this makes for a lighter weight board and crisper graphics.
Most boards will have a number assigned to the base indicating the number of pores per square inch. These can run from 500-8,000 with more pores meaning a faster board that needs to be waxed more often.

, This is the amount of curve in the board between the nose and the waist and differs by brand to brand. Side cut is measured in meters by the radius of the circle that would be created if it were continued all the way around.


Freestyle riders and beginners may want to choose a board with a lower side cut measure (deeper curve), which affords greater ability to turn quickly.
A larger side cut measurement smaller (more shallow) is best for longer, slower turns and provides more surface area on the ground, making it better for freeriders and powder riders.
There are many new side cut technologies that offer bumps or areas in the side cut that offer additional contact points to grip better in the snow. These are good for icy hard-packed terrain.

, Side walls are the edges of the board between the base and the top. They hold the board together and protect the edges of the core from damage. They can be made with a cap construction or sandwich construction.


A cap construction is where the top sheet wraps over the edges of the board and will hold better in icy and hard-packed conditions. They are more durable but more difficult to repair.
A sandwich construction is more common and easier to produce, making it cheaper and easier to repair. This is when a sidewall is inserted at the sides to protect the core. The side wall is sandwiched between the top layer and base of the board.

, A camber board is one that has an arch at the center with the nose and tail being the main contact points of the board with the ground. The other type, a rocker board, is the reverse of the camber.


Traditional camber has been around since the beginning of snowboards and provide more pop for freestyle riders, more responsive edge changes for all mountain riders and a smoother ride through uneven terrain because it can flex more. They hold their shape and flex for locker than rocker boards.
Rocker boards are liked by freestyle riders because they won’t catch edges on rails, by backcountry riders because they float over powder and by beginners because they make it easier to roll from edge to edge.
Some boards will simply be flat, which is in between a camber and rocker board, providing better turning ability than a fully camber board and more precise edging capability than a fully rocker board.
Different brands have different versions of camber and rocker boards so read the descriptions to see what that particular style was designed for.
Some brands are now experimenting with mixing the rocker and camber arches together on boards. For example, a board might have rocker in the center and camber at the nose and tail or camber in the center and rocker in the nose and tail. These are designed for different purposes and have a wide range of opinions.
There are no rules in terms of camber or rocker. Choose the version that works best for you., Some boards will have a particular layout of binding attachments for mounting the bindings to the board. In general most boards and bindings will be interchangeable but there are some that will not work together. There are four different types of mounting patterns: 2x4 disc pattern, 4x4 disc pattern, 3D pattern (Burton) and the channel system (Burton).


The 2x4 disc pattern has two rows of holes 4 cm apart. In each row the holes are separated by 2 cm. this allows for many different options when mounting bindings.
The 4x4 disc pattern has two rows of holes 4 cm apart and within each row the holes are separated by 4 cm.
The 3D pattern has holes shaped in a kind of a diamond pattern which are compatible with most bindings but offer more limited options in terms of stance. This pattern is common for Burton boards.
The channel system is a rail that allows the rider’s feet to have an extremely close connection to the board for a better feel on the board. These are common on Burton boards and it is best to use EST bindings by Burton. These bindings have many stance options. You can purchase a special plate to use non-Burton bindings on a board that uses the channel system.

, Choose your bindings according to both your boots and your board. They should be able to mount to your board and fit your boots inside. They come in three sizes (small, medium and large) and two different styles (strap-in and rear entry). They also differ according to flex, the straps, the highback and baseplate.


Choose your size by trying on the bindings with your boots. You can also check the manufacturer’s binding chart for the different sizes that will fit with small, medium or large bindings.
Strap-in bindings are the most common and have two straps, while rear-entry bindings have a highback that drops down to allow you to slide your boot in. Strap-ins offer the ability to make many adjustments for support and cushioning while rear-entry bindings make it very quick to bind your boots and go. Rear-entry bindings are usually preferred by more comfort-oriented riders.
The flex of a binding can vary between 0-10. Freestyle riders will choose a more flexible binding with a flex of 1-2 for greater room for error, easier landings and the ability to tweak grabs. All mountain riders will choose a medium flex of 3-5 for all types of riding while freeriders will choose stiffer bindings with a flex of 6-8 for better response and energy transfer to the snowboard.
Strap-in will generally have a toe strap and a larger ankle strap over the ankle. The toe strap can either be a traditional toe strap over the toes or a toe cap strap that goes over and in front of the toes for gaining more response from the board. A one piece strap will be one strap over the foot that is most common on rear entry bindings.
The highback is the plate from the heel cup to the lower calf and controls the heelside edge of your board. Softer and shorter high backs give more flexibility and ease to freestyle riders and beginners while stiff and taller highbacks give greater control and speed. Your highback can also be adjusted at an angle according to your preferences.
The baseplate is your connection between the binding and the board and are made of different materials. Higher-end bindings will have stronger and more flexible baseplate materials to optimize board flex, power transmission and durability. Some baseplates are also tilted at a slight angle (called canting) to angle your stance and knee position slightly forward for a more natural feel.
Kids may get frustrated by bindings that are difficult for them to secure. Step-in bindings or rear-entry bindings are often easier for kids to use but strap-in bindings may be ok as well. Have your kid test out securing the bindings while wearing boots and a snow jacket to make sure they can use them properly.

Think about how much time and space you have.,
Start with the equipment.,
Decide what kind of ground you will have the course on.,
Mow the fairway.,
Mow the green.,
Create 2-3 sand traps/hazards.,
Finally, maintain your course!",How to Design a Golf Course in Your Backyard," It will be more work than you think to design the course, maintain it, and depending on how complex it is, you may not be able to tear it down if you don't want it anymore. You will need a fairly large backyard in order to do this.




Of course, it's just going to be one hole. It's not an entire nine or eighteen hole course.

;
, Make sure you have a pitching wedge/sand wedge and a putter. These are the only clubs you will really need if you're just golfing in your backyard. Make sure to have multiple balls, since you may lose some. Also make sure you have a good grass mower that can cut the grass nice and short.

, If you own a very large piece of land, and are willing to spend lots of time maintaining the course, maybe you could make a par four or five. But if you just have an average big backyard, it should be a par three, definitely. Make sure that on the land you are designing the course on, that it is rather flat and not too bumpy; that is, it doesn't have many hills or slopes.




If you have a fairly sized backyard, your course should be about 15 yards (13.7 m) long.



, It would be neat to mow every other row, so it's striped like a real fairway. You should mow the fairway every 3-4 days. Depending on how big your backyard is, you should make the fairway about 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m). across.




Make sure the grass around the fairway is rather long (3-4 in.) so you have a rough. Also, always make sure the fairway is a little longer than the green.



, To mow the green, set your mower blades to the lowest setting so the grass is extra short. Try to place the green on the flattest surface of your yard. You should mow the green every 2 days. Sort of try to line the green up with the fairway, but don't connect the fairway and green directly. Leave a few feet in between for the rough. The green should be, depending on the size of your course, roughly around 8 feet (2.4 m). x 8 feet (2.4 m).




Try to make the green about the same width as the fairway.



, Buy 2-3 large sandbags at a hardware store. You shouldn't need any more than three sand traps throughout your course. Try to have at least one along the side of the fairway and at least one in front, behind, or alongside the green. The sand traps should be no bigger than 5 feet (1.5 m). x 5 feet (1.5 m). While sand traps are not necessarily, they make a good touch and reputation for a golf course.

, At real courses, they have crews come out every day to maintain the courses. While you may not need to mow your course every day, just every 3-4 days, just take about 15-20 minutes from your day to check up on your course. Invite some friends over to play together, this will make it a lot more fun!

Understand golf carts.,
Use the key.,
Put your seat belt on.,
Accelerate.,
Use the brake.,
Drive backwards.",How to Drive a Golf Cart1," Golf carts are classified under Neighborhood Electric Vehicles. Despite the vehicle's name, golf carts are used off golf courses for a variety of reasons. Golf carts fall between 15-35 mph top speed by regulation standards. You must be 14 years of age or older to drive a golf cart.


You don’t need a license to drive a golf cart.
Depending on what state or county you live in, you may need a permit to operate a golf cart.Most state's allow an unlicensed driver to drive on private roads, but not on main roads for long distances. It's okay to cross an intersection of a main road.
You'll need a license to drive on public roads.;
, Like the golf cart’s older cousin, the automobile, you will need a key to start it. Insert the key in the key slot and turn it to the right. You probably won’t hear a loud startup like you would for a car. Most golf carts run on electricity and the key merely turns the battery on.


You may also see a reverse setting, but set the key to forward motion.
Some golf carts run on gasoline and electricity. These carts will start up with a familiar engine sound.

, Although the golf carts do not run too fast, it’s still a good idea to buckle up. Some carts won’t exceed 14 mph and therefore don’t have seat belts. Be sure that any young children riding with you know to remain seated.

, Once everyone is seated, you’re ready to accelerate in the golf cart. Use your foot to press down on the thin, right pedal.The pedal is sensitive to the amount of pressure you use. Start with mild pressure using your foot to get a feeling for the handle of the golf cart. Once you understand how the cart operates, add more pressure to the pedal.


Do not floor the acceleration pedal upon startup. Increase the pressure and speed with your foot on the pedal gradually.

, Take your foot off the acceleration pedal and press it on the wider pedal.This is the same setup for automobiles with the left pedal, usually the widest pedal, activates the vehicle's brakes. Don’t slam on the brake unless you absolutely have to.


For normal use, ease onto the break much like you use the acceleration pedal.

, To go backwards, pull or turn the switch on your cart and use the acceleration pedal. Most golf carts will not go as fast using the backwards setting. Turn your body by putting your right arm around the back of the passenger seat. This position will allow you to see everything behind you.

Drive at night.,
Understand the rules of the road.,
Use the horn.,
Slow down when turning.,
Consider insurance.",How to Drive a Golf Cart2," It is important to take extra precautions when driving at night. Before driving at night, make sure your golf cart is equipped with headlights, brake lights, turn signals and reflective devices.If you don’t have these safety measures on your vehicle, reconsider driving at night or consider investing into your cart.

, Golf carts are not allowed on any road with a posted speed that exceeds 35 mph. This is for the safety of the golf cart and the other cars on the road. Aside from safety measures, golf carts can cause unexpected traffic which could lead to aggravated drivers. Over half the states don't allow golf carts on public roads.


For safety measures, golf carts cannot be on roads above 35 mph. Your golf cart needs to be able to go 25 mph to access public roads.
These are the current list of states that allow golf carts on public roads: CA, NV, AZ, NM, CO, WY, IL, MN, IA, FL, GA and TX., The horn is another practical safety measure. It is especially efficient used at intersections. While the horn isn’t encouraged on the golf course, it is great for off the course. This can help pedestrians and other golfers to watch out for your cart.Try not to use the horn with malice towards another player.

, Just like with automobiles, you need to slow down when turning your cart. Even turning at a speed of 11 mph can project a passenger from the golf cart. Golf carts don’t have doors and some don’t even have seatbelts. Keep your passengers and yourself safe by slowing down significantly before turning.

, There is never a guarantee you won’t injure someone if you own a golf cart. Many insurance agencies will offer a wide insurance plan that covers vehicles like segways, golf carts and snowmobiles. Insurance will help you pay for medical bills and damage to your vehicle."

There are a couple of features that club companies try to maximize for each club. These features include things like center of gravity, moment of inertia, sole design and grooves.


Since manufacturers are trying to optimize the same things, it really makes clubs very similar. Also, technology has come so far that club performance is very comparable. The only real changes between clubs are the slight differences in the way each company designs and manufactures the club. These slight differences give each club a slightly different feel.;
, While manufacturers try to optimize a club's center of gravity, moment of inertia and other aspects to give a club increased performance, making these changes comes at a price. Technology such as cavity backs make clubs more forgiving on off center hits and help player's hit the ball straighter, but they also make the club a little bit of a one-trick-pony.


Skilled players want much more control to bend the ball left and right and hit it at different height levels. They are willing to trade forgiveness for control because they do not need that forgiveness. While a skilled golfer can play well with forgiving clubs, they might find it a little difficult to hit big draws and fades. An unskilled golfer will find it very difficult to play with clubs designed for a skilled golfer, though.

, Before you can pick the best set of clubs for you, you have to come to terms with what your golfing skill level is. You would probably fall into one of these four categories.


Low Handicap: 0-5 Handicap; You are a able to hit both draws and fades and have a good understanding of the proper mechanics involved in the golf swing. You consistently hit the ball in the center of the club face.
Mid-Low Handicap: 5-15 Handicap; You are an avid golfer who loves to play the game in your spare time. You get out most weekends and usually play well mostly on your own natural ability. You are comfortable hitting most of your clubs but you do miss-hit the ball every once in while.
High-Mid Handicap: 15-25 Handicap; You are a recreational golfer who likes to play casually every now and then with friends. You still miss-hit the ball and probably have a hard time keeping it around the fairway and hitting the green. You need clubs that are forgiving.
High Handicap: 25+ Handicap; You are new to the game or a senior who has a hard time moving like you used to. You need clubs that are very forgiving. You also want clubs that will help you lift the ball off the ground by having a sole that won't dig into the turf.

, Club manufacturing companies generally make clubs that fit into each category. You can go to their websites and look at the different clubs and probably pick out which clubs are which. The thinner, compact, blade-like clubs are for the more skilled players while the the larger cavity-back or hybrid type clubs are for players who need maximum forgiveness. The clubs that are in-between are for the avid and recreational golfers.

, Once you have picked out a couple of clubs from different manufacturers that you think might be geared toward your skill level, go out and hit a few balls with them. As mentioned above, each club's performance is going to be relatively comparable; so after you've picked some club's designed for your skill level, the only real difference is going to be how they feel to you. This is why it is important to hit each club.

, After hitting each set of clubs, pick the one that you liked the best. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable, your swing will take care of the rest.

Swing with your full upper body.Use your entire upper body to facilitate the chip.,
Swing downward.Your initial contact with the ball should be in a downward strike.,
Raise the club as it makes impact with the golf ball.While you'll be able to maximize your force and control by swinging downward, scooping up when your club meets the ball will give the ball the air it needs to escape the grass.,
Follow through with the motion after the ball has made contact.,
Watch where the ball ends up.,
Decide if the situation warrants chipping the ball.,
Choose a club with the right ratio.A ratio refers to the distance you want the ball to fly compared to the distance you want it to roll after.,
Hold your club firmly.With any shot, including chipping, you should hold the golf club firmly.,
Align the ball with your sternum.Much of a good chip in golf revolves around proper stance and positioning.,
Keep your chest up.Keep your arms back and your chest up throughout the course of your swing.,
Place your feet closely together.Your feet should be planted firmly on the ground while you execute a chip.,
Open up your hip.A proper swing will disperse the exertion throughout your upper body, rather than packing the strain into one area.,
Get lessons.Lessons will accelerate the learning process.,
Train using an elongated club.If you're having any issues with footing and stance, an elongated club will act as a helpful indicator of when you go too far.,
Make phantom contact with the ball as you work out your stance.,
Practice every week.,
Experiment with different chipping stances.Although there are certain rights and wrong when it comes to golf stances, part of the fun of learning involves figuring out your personal style.",How to Chip a Golf Ball," Avoid swinging with your wrists, as this movement will limit your force and control. Swing so that you're able to feel the movement in your hips.


While your upper body should be limber throughout the movement, keep your feet and legs relatively stable.;
, The most common mistake beginners make is to hit up. Rather, the first part of a successful chip swing will aim down, only moving up once the club makes contact with the ball.

, Both the downward swing and upward scoop should be accomplished in a single, fluid motion.


When you become more experienced with chipping, you may control the chipping force to accommodate the distance you want the ball to sail.

, A proper chip won't end with the ball's impact. In order to maximize your force, you should see the swing through, leaving your club back up in the air. Complete the swing in the same fluid motion you started with.

, After a chip, the ball should fly a short distance and proceed to roll. As with any golf shot, you should keep your eye on where the ball lands. Keeping an eye on the ball is important during practice, as well. It can teach you how much force you need with each club to go a given distance.

, Chipping the ball is a more strategic move than a regular golf shot. It is meant to get your ball out of a tricky situation, such as if you're caught in the grass or trying to navigate past a hill. Chipping the golf ball should not be used in instances where a normal shot can easily be employed.


This rule doesn't apply if you're trying to learn the shot. If anything, you should practice the basics of chipping on a smooth surface before you move on to its usual application.

, Because chip shots are used to get your ball out of the grass and back on course, you can estimate the distance from the grassed ball to the green, plus the distance you want the ball to go on the green. You can measure the distances by using footsteps. For instance, if your ball is five steps away from the green and the hole is ten steps following that, you will have a 1-to-2 ratio.


A sand wedge is good for a 1-to-1 ratio from the grass to the green.
A pitching wedge is good for a 1-to-2 ratio.
A 9-iron is a 1-to-3 ratio.

, Because chipping the ball successfully requires so much control, make sure your hands are placed properly on the club before you attempt to chip the ball.

, You should aim your body slightly ahead of the ball, with your sternum drawing a parallel line with the location of the ball.


The sternum refers to the middle of one's chest.

, Arching your chest will result in a skewed chip because it will change direction of the club. If you're having any difficulty with achieving a proper stance, get someone else to watch you.

, There should be a space between your feet roughly equivalent to one of your feet. Your feet should be parallel with one another, both aimed directly forward.

, Letting your hip on the other side of the club move around will take some of the stress off your wrists.

, Although some golf instructors can be quite pricey (ranging upwards of 100 USD per hour), getting a few lessons in will help you to unlearn bad habits you may have picked up on your own.

, If you swing too far or change your back position, the back of the club will clip you in the back. This slightly painful reprimand will remind you that you're doing it wrong.


Holding a pool stick alongside the club also works in lieu of a long club.

, With a ""phantom swing,"" you will execute the swing, stopping right before the ball itself. This movement will allow you to practice the motion of chipping a ball without having to retrieve the ball each time you go through with it.

, As with any skill, you need to commit to regular practice in order to polish your chipping technique. You should try to golf at least once a week, and when you do, include chipping as part of the skills you practice. Once you figure out the foundation, you can treat it as you would any other skill.

, Experiment with different footings, swings, and warm-ups. Although it's important to have a firm learning foundation in place before getting creative, it should be seen as a natural part of the learning process to find your own style.

Play a few games with golf clubs that you have borrowed from others or perhaps second-hand clubs.,
Invest in a set of beginner golf clubs.,
Explore complete golf club sets to invest in when you have used these clubs for at least a year.,
Build up your set of clubs.,
Understand, over time, your game and the golf components you will need to enhance your game.",How to Choose the Correct Golf Club," Make sure you have a 3-wood, a mix of irons and a putter in your set. These clubs will help you familiarize yourself with the game and better understand the style you have.;
, Don’t go in for the expensive, top-of-the-line products immediately, rather work your way up. Here is where you pick a set based on the side you play on and your gender. You can also choose between steel and graphite shafts, though if you are a beginner, steel shafts are wallet-friendly and durable. Your set should have a 3-wood, driver, and clubs in odd numbers of 3, 5, 7 as well as 9. A putter and bag will complete your set.

, The idea is to try to improve on your game, so you will be looking for clubs with lower workability and forgiveness to match your style of swing. These sets will include a driver, woods of 3 and 5, 3-through pitching wedge irons and your choice of a putter. Don’t invest in specialty clubs at this stage.

, Get specialty irons like a useful 60-degree lob wedge or a sand one only when you are ready to do so. A long iron can prove to be quite useful. This will also be the time to replace one of your 3-irons with a 7-wood, especially if a long iron is not helpful.

, This is the stage where brand and unique models should be considered.

Look for a pair that is lightweight and flexible, but also sturdy.,
Find golf shoes with built-in memory foam - these can be especially comfortable.

,
Make sure that you get a pair of shoes that are waterproof and include moisture-wicking material on their exterior.

,
Walk around in the shoes and make sure that they feel absolutely comfortable for you!

,
When purchasing your shoes from a golf store, see if they have a little putting green and try out the different positions you would normally stand in when hitting your shot - this will let you feel how the shoes will conform to your foot at various angles and pressure.

,
If you are the type that likes to look good, be sure that the style fits your personality and your wardrobe - did you know that some athletes actual perform poorly when they do not feel the look their best?

,
Can't find a pair of shoes that are comfortable out of the box?,
Take advantage of any maintenance / additional warranties that a golf store may have to go with your shoes.",How to Choose Comfortable Golf Shoes," You want your shoes to be comfortable, but also supportive.;
,,,,,, Look for some supportive insoles. Some sports stores have a machine you can stand on to see which part of your feet have the most stress and have custom insoles to support those areas specifically.

Play golf!,
Determine your adjusted gross score.,
Find the course slope.,
Determine your handicap differential.,
Repeat these steps for every score.,
Select your best handicap differentials.,
Average your best differentials.,
Determine your handicap index.,
Multiply your handicap index by the slope rating.,
Divide the product by the standard slope rating.,
Find your course handicap.",How to Calculate a Golf Course Handicap," To determine your handicap differential and index, you will first need some golf scores to work with. For the best results, work with at least five scores, but using 20 scores is preferable.Tally your gross score from every individual game. The gross score is the actual number of strokes taken over an entire course.;
, On any hole where you’ve exceeded the maximum allowable strokes, deduct the necessary number of strokes. For instance, if you took nine strokes on a hole but have a maximum allowable score of seven, subtract two from your score for that hole. Recount your total for the course using the adjusted numbers. The United States Golf Association’s equitable stroke control uses the following guidelines for a course handicap of:Nine or less: maximum score per hole is a double bogey
10 to 19: maximum score is seven
20 to 29: maximum score is eight
30 to 39: maximum score is nine
40 and above: maximum score is 10 (use this default if you haven't yet determined your handicap)

, While the course rating is the difficulty rating for a golfer who shoots par (on average), the course slope is the difficulty rating based on a bogey golfer. A bogey golfer is a player who shoots 18 strokes over par, on average.The course rating and slope for a particular course are usually found on the score card. You can also check at the clubhouse, or on the course's website.

, This is a calculation involving the difference between your adjusted gross score and the course rating. The equation to determine this is:


(Adjusted gross score - course rating) x 113 ÷ slope rating
Round this number to the nearest tenth., Always use your most recent scores, up to a maximum of 20.

, Choose your 10 best (lowest) differentials if you are working with 20 scores. If you don’t yet have 20 scores to work with, select:Your top differential out of five or six
Your top two differentials out of seven or eight
Your top three differentials out of nine or 10
Your top four differentials out of 11 or 12
Your top five differentials out of 13 or 14
Your top six differentials out of 15 or 16
Your top seven differentials out of 17
Your top eight differentials out of 18
Your top nine differentials out of 19

, Add all the scores together, then divide that number by the amount of scores you're working with. For instance, if you’re working with 10 scores, add all 10 together and then divide that by 10; if you’re working with three differentials, divide the sum by three.

, Multiply your differential average by 96 percent, or 0.96. Then, without rounding any of the numbers, delete all the numbers after the tenths decimal place. This number is your handicap index.There are maximum default handicap indexes, and they are:


36.4 for males on an 18-hole course.
40.4 for females on an 18-hole course.
18.2 for males on a nine-hole course.
20.2 for females on a nine-hole course.

, Now that you have your handicap index, this portable number can be taken to any course and used to calculate your course handicap for any set of tees. Again, the slope rating should be listed on your score card, at the clubhouse, or on the course's website.

, This is an average difficulty rating for courses, and the USGA has determined that this average slope is 113.So, after you multiply your handicap index by the slope rating, divide it by 113.

, Round that number to the nearest whole number. Any number ending in .4 or below is rounded down, and any number ending in .5 or above is rounded up. This rounded whole number is your course handicap.

Prepare the golf bag.,
Anticipate your golfer's needs.,
Learn everything you can about golf.",How to Be a Golf Caddy1," There are certain items that your golfer will need for every round, and it's your responsibility to make sure the bag is properly stocked. If your golfer doesn't have everything required, it could adversely affect the game.Check your golfer's bag for the appropriate golf clubs, new golf balls, extra gloves, towels, a yardage finder, a yardage book, bug spray, sunscreen, an umbrella, and a medical kit. You might also want to include a rain suit for both of you if the weather is questionable.;
, The best caddies know what a golfer requires. Keep the golfer hydrated, as cool or dry as possible, and know which club is necessary for the next hole. Be able to distinguish each club and be ready to offer a couple of different solutions for each of the golfer's obstacles throughout the game.


Be sure to carry a towel at all times, since it will be your responsibility to clean the golfer's clubs and balls during a game.

, The more knowledgable you are about the game, the more of an asset you will be to your golfer. Watch golf, read about golf, play golf, and breathe golf. Visit various courses and talk to other caddies about their experiences.You can use networking experiences as a resource for learning more about golf and becoming an overall better caddy.
Ask caddies questions such as: ""How comfortable are you with that club?"" Offer suggestions, but get to know your golfer's communication preferences. Some golfers will want your advice often while others prefer to make their own calls and have very specific preferences.

"
"
Be assertive.,
Remain positive.,
Give pep talks.",How to Be a Golf Caddy2," Caddies need a certain amount of confidence in their knowledge of the game. It's acceptable to stop a golfer from swinging if you disagree with a club choice or if you sense the wind about to change. A golfer will be more at ease if he or she knows they can rely on their caddy.Never speak during a golfer's swing. Offer advice before they are teeing up and say something along the lines of, ""I think this club would be very effective here"" or ""Stay wary of this sudden breeze."" Some golfers will prefer that you stay out of the way and let them play, but others will love your words of encouragement.

, Golf is a game that requires intense concentration and a positive attitude on the part of the player. If your golfer is experiencing a few bad holes, it's your job to boost morale, help the golfer stay focused, and offer words of encouragement when they are most needed. If a golfer blames you for a poor game, you must remain calm and collected.If your golfer hits above par, say: ""Your next hole will be better. Just stay focused. You've got this."" Even if you need to critique your golfer or offer advice, try to stroke their ego so they can become more confident in their strokes!

, When a golfer is hitting over par, they may become frustrated. In order to ease their tension and keep them focused on their game, offer them words of encouragement and motivation. Learn how to communicate with your golfer in the most effective way; each golfer responds differently to advice. Never talk during their backswing."

Get to the course early.,
Learn the yardages of the course.,
Join the Professional Caddies Association (PCA).,
Stay alert to changing weather patterns.",How to Be a Golf Caddy3," If you are one of the first caddies to show up to the course, you are far more likely to get the chance to caddy for a golfer hitting the course early in the morning. Promptness indicates to the golfer that you are professional and prepared. You never know who could be getting ready to tee off, so never miss out on such an opportunity., A caddy needs to know the yardages of the holes, referring to the yardage book when necessary in order to help the golfer choose the right club for each hole.Knowing the yardages isn't always enough, and the caddy has to take the distances into account with weather conditions, course conditions and lie.

, If you are serious about your role as a caddy, this program can help you become professionally trained and certified. You will be able to learn your local course along with other major and nearby courses. There are also special benefits that come with such an exclusive membership, such as the potential to meet and work with exciting professional golfers at the top of their game , The wind and the elements can affect the golfer's game, so be ready to provide any information that is relevant. Play in various weather situations yourself to get a better idea of how this can affect one's swing."

Offer to work as a golf course caddy for local golfers at your area country club.,
Learn as much as you can about caddying and the sport of golf in general.,
Contact the European Tour, the Nationwide Tour and the Hooters Tour, either but email or telephone, and explain your experience to the contact person.,
Volunteer at any golf events within a two-hour drive of your home.,
Network with everyone you meet.,
Hand out business cards wherever you go.,
Remain positive.",How to Become a PGA Caddy," Being a hard worker will definitely get your further in the world of golf and you never know what professional golfer may hear your name.;
, No professional golfer will ever hire a caddy who has no experience or does not know anything about the sport. It is important to understand not only every aspect of the game, including rules and scoring, but also how the clubhouse operates.

, Express interest in working as a caddy to any available golfer. Granted, it's a long shot but many caddies got started this way.

, Most states host not only amateur events but also at least one professional event each year. Get involved in these events as often as possible regardless of what your job might be.

, Stay away from conflict with golfers and club staff as much as possible. Having a bad reputation in the golf world is the quickest way to ruin your chances in the professional sector.

, Give them to anyone you know in the golf world and leave a stack in every clubhouse you enter. These cards should have your name, what you are seeking, and a contact number and email. Even if you think one person at the golf course does not need it, she may know who can fulfill your dream.

, Nobody gets into professional caddying on the first try. You will be rejected many times before being accepted, but it's very important you take each rejection as a step toward your ultimate goal. You never know when you will get the call and all your dreams will come true.

Choose a location.,
Excavate the area of your golf green to a depth of 20 inches (51 cm).,
Design the green.,
Install the drainage system in 8-inch (20 cm) trenches to ensure that water will drain away from the center.,
Put in an irrigation system if necessary.,
Cover the area with a 4-inch (10 cm) layer of pea gravel.,
Add 2 inches (5 cm) of sand on top of the gravel and compact it.

,
Top the sand with about 14 inches (35 cm) of topsoil that consists of 60 percent sand and no more than 20 percent clay.,
Seed or sod your green.,
Mark the edges of your green by sodding the perimeter with rougher grass.,
Buy your cups, pins and flags from a supplier of golf course equipment.",How to Build a Golf Green," Your green should be built on a spot that has sandy soil, plenty of sun and good drainage. The location must also allow for breezes to come through in order to keep the grass healthy.;
, Be sure to remove all the existing sod so you don't have to contend with weeds.

, It should have a variety of slopes to challenge you, but ultimately slope away from the center. This will prevent puddles from forming after it rains.


If you want to have a depression in your green, you must install a drain pipe beneath it to carry away the water. However, this won't work if you build a green in a climate where the puddle will freeze during winter.

, Duct tape the connections and wrap the pipes so they won't come apart or you'll have to dig up your green to make repairs later.

, Keep in mind that adequate, even irrigation is the key to keeping turf healthy. Watering your green with a garden hose is time-consuming and tends to irrigate unevenly.


It's easiest to use your municipal water source if you do not live in an area that restricts water usage during droughts. If you choose a different water source (well, rainwater, gray water, etc.), you will have to more carefully monitor the effect of the water on your turf and irrigation system. Some water sources may clog sprinkler nozzles or introduce harmful chemicals.
You can water your green with garden sprinklers or drip lines connected to timers, but you will spend a lot of time moving them on and off the green. An underground system with pop-up sprinklers can be fully automated.
Install a residential sprinkler system rather than one designed for a golf course. Golf course irrigation systems operate at higher pressures in order to spread the water over a wider area. However, since you only have one green to irrigate, a residential system will work well and is less expensive.

, The gravel will hold water near the roots when you irrigate the green, but will allow water to pass through quickly during heavy rain so the grass doesn't drown. Compact the gravel layer.

,, It's best if you buy the right soil and bring it in, but you can test the soil you've got to see if it meets USGA standards. Compact this layer.

, Sodding often results in an uneven green, so seed instead if you have the time and patience to care for the grass until it matures. The variety of grass you will use for your green will largely depend on your climate.

, You may want to add a vapor barrier around your green before sodding to keep the surrounding area from sucking water away or adding water to your green.

, You may also want a cup changer that will allow you to change the position of your cup. You will also need to buy a special mower and mow your new green every day. You might be able to pick up a used one for less than $5000.00

Start your own business.,
Coach at the professional or national level.",How to Become a Golf Coach," Before you think about coaching players, you have to make sure your technique is as perfect as can be. For that, you need to ensure you have the right knowledge. The best way to do this is to get your own coach as you learn the game, as they can correct any mistakes or bad habits as you make them. You can find a golf coach at your local golf course or country club, as well as a directory for Professional Golfers Association certified instructors on their website.Alternatively, you can find plenty of golf training online. For instance, you can find numerous Youtube videos delving into the finer parts of the golf swing.;
, The best instruction will only get you so far if you don’t compound it with consistent practice. While you don’t necessarily need the skill level of a professional golfer before you can coach, you want to ensure you have a complete understanding of every aspect of the game.


Go to the driving range often to fine tune your swing, work on your short game and practice your putting.
Play as many rounds of golf as you can; this gives you the chance to encounter many of the potential problems your clients will need help with.
Play with a variety of players, and don’t be afraid to ask for pointers and guidance.

, There are many facets to golf beyond the swing, which you should expect to learn if you hope to become a coach. Learning the game of golf takes a lifetime of study and practice, but you need to make an active decision to learn. A skilled coach or instructor can help you with the finer points of golfing, as can reading books and online publications on the sport. The following are a few examples of what you need to learn if you hope to master the game of golf:


Golfing stance: The positioning of your feet can have an important effect on your swing, and understanding this effect can help you guide your students away from common mistakes.
Physics of golfing: Several physics concepts, such as rotational inertia and mass distribution affect the design of golf clubs and the gameplay itself.How to strike the ball: Where you strike the ball affects its spin and flight path, concepts that must be understood if they’re to be explained.
Adapting to the course: Be it wind or the sand traps, players must learn to do more than simply hit the ball as straight and as far as possible. Sometimes these adaptations have to be made on the fly.

, If you want to master the game, you need the best competition. At the amateur level, you’ll initially start playing at tournaments held by local golf courses and clubs. If you perform well enough, you might then be eligible for regional and national tournaments. International tours are usually played by elite professional golfers, though you may be able to get to this level with enough dedication and practice!


You can ask about local tournaments at the clubs where you play, while larger competitions will be featured on the websites of various golfing associations, such as the United States Golfers Association or the Professional Golfers Association.
Take these opportunities to network with other players, but not while they’re trying to line up a shot.

, While not necessary for employment, a Bachelor’s degree in Golf Management can help you find work as a golf coach. These degrees usually cover management and business practices as well as coaching, preparing you for every aspect of this career. Make sure to look for a program sanctioned by the Professional Golfer’s Association (PGA), as these offer higher quality instruction and internship possibilities. There are 18 universities with PGA accredited program; the complete list can be found on the PGA website., Individual amateur players might not necessarily ask for a certification before using your services, but many employers will require certification. Certification programs can be relatively short, with 5 and 7 day courses available. A quality course will offer training beyond golfing practices, such as golf psychology, biomechanics, nutrition and the differences involved in coaching at different competition levels.Some associations offering golf coach certifications are:


Professional Golf Teachers Association of America: This association offers certification second only to the Professional Golfers Association. Completing this certification allows you to find work in various settings, from golf clubs to universities.United States Golf Teachers Federation: While not as prestigious as other organizations, certification with this federation still qualifies you to teach golfers at any level., Obtaining certification from the PGA identifies you as a professional golfer. As such, it’s a lengthy and expensive process, but can give you access to better paying employment opportunities and the ability to coach elite professional players.Obtaining certification from the PGA can be done in three ways:


The PGA apprentice program: this requires a certain level of ability with golf as well as being employed full-time in a golf-related occupation to apply, and involves a professional golf management program.Completing a PGA Golf Management University program: Several universities accredited by the PGA offer their own golf management program, which typically lasts 5 years. Graduates earn a Bachelor’s degree and can apply for PGA membership.Class A members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association can take advantage of the Test-Out option, allowing them to transition to member status within the PGA., It might not be as prestigious or pay as much as a country club, but teaching golfers in high school can still be incredibly satisfying. Even if you see yourself coaching professional players, starting in high school or college clubs can give you the experience you need to reach your goal.

, These employers typically look for certification in the coaches they employ, though this is not always the case. Begin by looking for golf courses and country clubs in your city. They might not initially hire you as a coach, but keep in mind many professional golfers start as caddies to gain experience in the sport before coaching or playing themselves.

, If you have the necessary mindset for business, you might want to start your own coaching business rather than relying on job openings. As you develop your client base, you might find yourself coaching from home, or at your client’s home. Keep in mind that it’s particularly important to be certified if you decide to start your own business.

, Unlike employment at golf courses, having professional golf clients almost always requires professional certification with the PGA. Professional golf players typically seek out their coaches, which is different from applying to a job opening at a golf course or program.Continue coaching the most you can and playing the best game you can, and you might be chosen to coach a professional player or the national team.

The kickturn basically involves leaning back on your board to lift the front wheels off the ground and do a 180 degree turn.
This gives you a very quick and precise turn, which can be done on the ground or on a ramp.
It is a good building block for more advanced tricks.;
, The ollie is perhaps the most important trick you can learn, as it's the starting point for a huge array of more advanced tricks.
/images/thumb/2/2b/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-2-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-2-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/2/2b/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-2-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-2-Version-8.jpg









An ollie is basically a jump while the board sticks to your feet. To do an ollie, you need proper foot placement, along with good balance and timing skills.
Basically, you need to bend your knees in a crouched position as you roll, then jump up, popping the tail of the skateboard off the ground as you jump. Make sure to bend your knees as you land to absorb the shock.
As you get better, you can practice doing higher and longer ollies., A nollie is a variation of the ollie, which basically involves popping the front of the skateboard off the ground as you jump, rather than the back. Once you've mastered the ollie, the nollie should be easy to learn.
/images/thumb/7/7a/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-3-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-3-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/7/7a/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-3-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-3-Version-8.jpg









To do a nollie, shift your front foot to the nose of the board and place your back foot in the middle of your trucks. Crouch down, then jump up, popping the front of your board hard off the ground. Level the board in mid-air, then bend your knees as you land.
You might feel slightly awkward while learning to nollie, as learning how to pop the board with your non-dominant foot can be tricky. Don't worry if you can't get the same height with your nollies as you can with your ollies. - This is normal., A manual is kind of like doing a wheelie on your bike, where you lean back and lift the front wheels of the skateboard off the ground, while still rolling.
/images/thumb/2/28/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/2/28/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg









Manuals are all about balance, so take some time to get your foot position right. Place your back foot on the tail of the skateboard (almost covering the whole thing) and place your front foot just behind the front trucks.
Now lean your weight backwards until the front wheels come off the ground and try to hold that position while rolling. Don't lean too far back though or the tail will drag across the ground, damaging your board.
When learning to manual, it is very common for skaters to lean too far back, shooting the board out in front of them. When this happens, it is easy to fall back and knock your head on the ground, which is very dangerous. Therefore, it is important to always wear a helmet while skating., A 180 is basically an ollie where both you and your board spin 180 degrees in the air, landing switch or fakie. This is one of the more difficult basic tricks, so you should have your ollies and kickturns down before attempting it.
/images/thumb/c/c1/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-5-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-5-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/c/c1/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-5-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-5-Version-8.jpg









You can 180 frontside or backside -- this basically refers to which way you spin. Spinning forwards (backside) is considered easier than spinning backwards (frontside). *The words are opposite for flat ground tricks, spinning frontways will be backside and vice versa.
To do a frontside ollie, place your feet in ollie position. As you crouch down in preparation to jump, wind your body by turning your shoulders toeside towards the back.
Pop the back of the board off the ground, then rotate your shoulders frontside as you jump. The rest of your body and your board will follow your shoulders.
You can land fakie or switch: fakie means rolling backwards, while switch means riding with your non-dominant foot forwards. , The vast majority of skateboarding tricks are simply variations on these basic tricks. The more variations you add, the more impressive your skateboarding will look.
/images/thumb/4/4e/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/4/4e/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg










Kickturn variations: frontside kickturn, tic-tac, fakie kickturn and kickturn on transition.

Ollie and nollie variations: Once you have learn how to ollie, you can start ollieing off curbs, ramps, down stairs, etc. You an also do 180s, 360s (or more rotations) both frontside and backside. In addition, any tricks you do with an ollie can also be done with a nollie, for variation.

Manual variations: For variations on the manual, you can do nose manuals (rolling on two front wheels instead of two back wheels), one foot manuals and one wheel manuals.

, The kickflip is another fundamental trick to learn.
/images/thumb/6/61/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-7-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-7-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/6/61/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-7-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-7-Version-8.jpg









It is basically an ollie where you kick the heelside edge of the skateboard while you jump, so it flips around in the air before you land.
Once you have learned the basic kickflip, you can practice some variations, such a the varial kickflip, the double kickflip, the kickflip body varial and the kickflip indie.

, A pop shove-it is another variation on an ollie, where you use your feet to rotate the board 180 degrees before landing.
/images/thumb/2/23/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/2/23/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg









To do a backside pop shove-it (which is much easier than the frontside variation), you will need to scoop your back foot backwards as you pop the tail, as if you were wiping something nasty off the sole of your show. This give the board the slight backwards spin it needs to complete the 180 rotation.
Lift your front foot off the board as you jump, so your feet hover over the board as it rotates. Catch the board with both feet before landing.
To perform a frontside pop shove-it you will need to scoop your back foot forwards as you pop it, so it rotates in the opposite direction. With this trick, you should allow you back foot to do most of the work, otherwise the board will flip over as it rotates., A heelflip is kind of like the opposite of a kickflip; instead of using your front foot to flip the board heelside, you use your back foot to flip the board toeside.
/images/thumb/5/55/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/5/55/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg









Start in an ollie position, then pop the board off the ground with your back foot. As you jump, slide your front foot diagonally towards the front toeside edge of the board, then use your heel to flick the skateboard.
Jump backwards slightly to keep the board directly beneath you and tuck your legs to give the board time to flip. Once it has completed one full flip, catch the board with your feet and bend your knees while you land.
Once you've mastered the basic heelflip, you can try double and triple heelflips, where the board flips multiple times before you catch it.

, 360 flips (also known as tre-flips) are sometimes referred to as ""the best trick in skateboarding"" because they look so sweet.
/images/thumb/1/15/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/1/15/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg









A 360 is basically a combination of a kickflip and a 360 degree shove-it. They can be a little hard to get the hang of, as the timing needs to be just right.
Put your feet in the kickflip position, then move your front foot back so it's in the center of the board. Hang the toes of your back foot over the edge of the board.
Pop the board hard with your back foot to get a high ollie, then simultaneously scoop your back foot backwards to rotate the board (like a shove-it) and kick your front foot forward (like in a kickflip) to flip it.
Tuck your knees high to give the board room to spin and flip. Keep an eye on it and try to watch for the grip tape, as this is your signal to catch the board with your feet.
You probably won't get this move on your first try, or even the second or third. Just keep trying and make sure you have a clear mental image of what the board and both of your feet are supposed to be doing., A hardflip is a pretty difficult trick, as the name would suggest. It is essentially a frontside pop shove-it kickflip.
/images/thumb/1/1c/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/1/1c/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg









Start with your front foot behind the bolts, with your toes pointing almost straight ahead. Place your back foot on the tail, with your heel hanging off the back edge. Try to balance on the balls of both feet, as this will make executing the trick easier.
Pop the board off the ground, then simultaneously scoop your back foot forward to rotate the board frontside (like a frontside shove-it) and use your front foot to flip the board (like a kickflip).
Make sure to keep your front foot out of the way, as it's easy to get it caught in the board as it flips. If you're having difficulty catching the board with both feet, try landing the trick with just your front foot first, until you get better., A 50/50 grind is the first grind trick most skaters learn. It involves grinding on a curb, ledge or rail with your weight evenly distributed across both trucks.
/images/thumb/d/d5/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d5/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg









Roll up to the curb or ledge you intend to grind at a good speed, almost parallel to the surface. Ollie onto the ledge, using your front foot to guide the board into position.
Make sure the ledge is centered between your trucks and keep your knees bent as you grind.
At the end of the ledge, pop the tail of the skateboard to jump off and try to land on all four wheels at the same time., A nose grind involves grinding on your front trucks, potentially letting the nose of the deck touch the ledge/curve for added balance.
/images/thumb/c/cd/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/c/cd/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg









Roll up parallel to the ledge at a good speed with your feet in an ollie position. Pop an ollie, then shift your front foot towards the nose of the board and your back foot towards the center of the board, so the back is tilted upwards.
Land on your front truck, and touch the nose lightly off the ledge. Keep your weight centered on the front truck; if you lean too far forwards, the nose will stick and your grind will come to an abrupt stop.
Pop out by shifting your weight backwards, so it's weighted evenly across the board.
When you start trying nosegrinds, slam down the nose of the board right as it gets as high as the curb and it will automatically balance., A boardslide is the most basic sliding trick you can do. It involves popping an ollie onto a curb, ledge or handrail, so that the board is parallel to it, then sliding along between the trucks.
/images/thumb/f/fe/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/f/fe/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg









It is a good idea to start small with boardslides (like on a curb), as handrails can be dangerous to your groin with this trick! However, if you're using a concrete curb to start out, make sure to wax it up well first, so your board can slide easily.
Ride up alongside the curb with your feet in an ollie position. Ollie and turn your body and board 90 degrees, landing with the curb in the center of the skateboard. The skateboard should be perpendicular to the curb.
Bend your knees and keep your weight evenly balanced as the board slide along the curb. When you reach the end, place more weight on the back of your board, as you want your back wheels to land first., Dropping in isn't really a trick as such, but it's essential if you want to start using ramps and half pipes  seriously.
/images/thumb/b/bc/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-15-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-15-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/b/bc/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-15-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-15-Version-8.jpg









The hardest part of dropping in is overcoming your fear -- the technique itself is quite easy. Position your skateboard so that the tail is resting on top of the coping with the wheels sitting snugly against the ramp.
Position your back foot on the tail, placing most of your weight there in order to keep the board from moving too soon. Place your front foot lightly (but securely) at the top of the skateboard.
When you're ready (try not to think too hard about it or you will psych yourself out), tip your wheels and body forward until your body is perpendicular with the ramp. Don't lean forwards or backwards -- keep your body position the same as when you are riding on flat ground.
When the wheels hit the ramp, bend your knees and continue rolling as normal., Rock to Fakies and Rock n' Rolls are two great ramp tricks to learn. However, they should be practiced on mini ramps first before you attempt them on any larger ramps, otherwise you could get hurt.
/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-16-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-16-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-16-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-16-Version-8.jpg










Rock to Fakies: Roll up to the coping with enough speed to get the front half of your skateboard over the edge. Push down with your front foot until the front wheels touch the deck, then lift your foot off to allow the front wheels to clear the coping as you start rolling backwards. Once the wheels have cleared the coping, set them back down and roll away fakie.Rock n' Rolls: Rock n' Rolls start off the same way as rock to fakies. Roll your front wheels over the coping until they touch the deck, but instead of rolling away fakie, do a 180 degree kickturn and roll away facing the opposite direction., The lipslide is a cool trick which is also called a ""disaster"", as it has been known to snap boards clean in two!
/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg









Skate up the ramp, popping a 180 ollie as you rise over the coping. Land with the middle of the board on the coping, crouching to absorb the shock.
Take the weight off your back foot to allow the back wheels to clear the coping and switch rock back in. "

Start rolling at a comfortable speed.,
Position your feet.,
Initiate the shove it.,
Practice until you perfect it.",How to Do a Shove it on a Skateboard," One of the best ways to practice a trick before trying it out is to hold onto something for support. You can still go through the motions of a trick without rolling on cement. Practice somewhere like a garage and use a railing to hold onto.


You can also practice tricks while sitting down. You just need to make sure that your board has enough space to move.;
, Place your front foot directly above the front wheels with your toe pointed slightly out. Next, place your back foot on the edge of the board with your toe slightly overhanging the tail, also with your toe pointed slightly out. Last, center your body weight above the board., The shove it is a simple trick that relies on the friction created from your feet. The idea is that you move each foot in the opposite direction. With enough force from your feet, the skateboard will spin at 180 degrees. If done correctly, the board should rotate and land on an even line. It is best to practice while holding onto something because you jump off your skateboard while the board spins.









You control most of the spin, or the ""shove,"" with your back foot. Your back foot has more influence than your front foot.
You are definitely at risk of hurting yourself once you land on the board after it spins., Once the board is spinning, it is important to land on the board when after a 180 degree rotation. Pay attention to where your feet land. If you do not balance your feet onto the board after the rotation, you could fall. Watch how the board spins and practice getting the board to land as close to where you started.









On the landing, attempt to balance your feet by placing each foot on the opposite end of the board.

, Use the same location you attempted the trick with railing, but this time don’t hold onto anything.


If you fall, you are learning. Falling is a requirement for learning how to skateboard.
Practice until you land the trick without holding onto anything for support.
Eventually move on to practicing the trick while rolling. This will be the true test of whether you can do the trick. Many skateboarders think that you’ll get better faster the sooner you begin practicing your tricks on the move.

, Try to find a patch of concrete that is smooth. The best way to undergo this trick, at first, is at a slow speed. Start with two pushes and then prepare to do the trick.









Wear a helmet if you are scared of jumping on and off your skateboard.

, Place your front foot over the front bolts or even a little farther forward. Have your back foot between the back bolts and the tail. Before a trick, it helps if you crouch down and bend your knees. There isn’t one position you should take for this trick. All skaters perform tricks in their own style.









If your footwork is different from the recommended setup, then try it out. You should strive for comfort.Once you get used to it, start to place your front foot closer and closer to the middle of your board.

, Without stomping the tail, use your back foot to shove the tail to your heel side. Use your front foot to help turn the board. Jump in the air as the board starts spinning. When you see the tail come around (i.e., when the board has spun 180 degrees), extend your legs and land on the board.









Try not to land both feet on one side of the board or you will fall.
While in the air make a conscious effort to place each foot on different sides of the board.

, Skateboarding takes hard work and determination. You probably won’t be able to land the trick after trying 10 or more times. Eventually you will find a way to modify your technique to land the trick. The goal is to land the trick 4 out of 5 attempts. You should expect to fall when practicing a new trick.









Use your weight to balance the impact of landing.Wear knee pads, elbow pads, and any other protective equipment you think you may need.

",How to Do a Hardflip Doubleflip on a Skateboard," The backfoot should be set up like a hardflip. The front foot should be placed like a hardflip, except you want to move it down the deck a little more.;
,, Right now, it's just like executing a regular Hardflip.

, It won't require any more or less force than a plain Hardflip.

, Remember the footing, it will require to time it differently.

, This part requires a little more force.

, Watch as the board goes nuts under you.

, This may be confusing at first, but at this point you should be a good enough skateboarder to sort this out.

Test how your dominant foot performs.,
Stick to your confirmed stance.,
Practice a stable riding stance.,
Get comfortable with pushing off.After practicing your stable stance like that for a few sessions, it should start feeling a little more natural.,
Avoid being a mongo foot.",How to Determine if You're Regular or Goofy Foot," These terms refer to the two stances used in board sports.Your stance is which foot is in front of the other when you’re riding. Regular means to stand on the board with your left foot forward. Your right foot will be behind it, near the tail of the board.Goofy is the opposite of regular – your right foot is forward and your left foot is back near the tail.The foot you choose to put in front affects which direction you’ll be facing on the board.
For example, if a regular skater and a goofy skater were riding side by side, they’d be facing opposite directions.;
, When standing on a board, you’ll want your dominant foot to go in the back, since it’s stronger and does most of the pushing, turning, etc. If you are right-handed, it’s highly likely that your dominant foot is your right foot. This would mean your left foot goes in front and your stance is regular. This is usually how it works out, but not always.Some people who are right foot dominant prefer riding goofy (right foot forward). Some people who are left foot dominant prefer riding regular (left foot forward). It's uncommon, but it does happen.
Try a few simple tests to determine or confirm your dominant foot.

, One of the easiest and most reliable ways to determine your dominant foot is the “slide” test. Put on a thick pair of socks and find a smooth, hard-surfaced floor. Take a running start and gain a little speed. When you’re ready, switch from running to sliding. Take the final stride and then land flat-footed on both feet, balancing yourself as you slide across the floor in your socks.Usually, the foot that lands in the front will be your dominant foot on the board.Make sure you are in a room with enough open space to perform this test properly.

, Stand naturally with your feet even and close together. Ask a friend to gently push you from behind. Try your best not to anticipate the push. You’ll feel like you’re falling, and one of your feet will naturally try to brace your fall. The foot that you catch yourself with is usually your dominant foot.If you don’t have a friend around, you can perform the “lean” test by yourself. Stand with your feet together. Slowly lean forward.
Keep leaning until you feel like you’re going to fall. The foot you use to catch yourself is probably your dominant foot.Be sure to perform this safely. Your partner should push you gently. Wear knee pads, just in case you aren't able to catch your fall.

, Have both of your feet flat on the ground and side by side. Have someone yell “go” and then start running up the stairs. The foot that lands on the bottom stair first will most likely be your dominant foot.Try it a couple of times in a row to see if you react the same each time.


You can also try this by approaching a flight of stairs at a normal walking pace. The foot you instinctively use on the first step is your dominant foot.
Try it both ways to see which foot is more comfortable.

, A basketball or football will work fine too. Hold the ball out in front of you with both hands. Imagine that you have to kick this ball to score a goal. Drop the ball out in front of you and then kick it. The foot that you instinctively kick with is probably your dominant foot.Repeat the exercise a few times to see if you get the same results.

, Have a friend stand in front of you. Get on the board and stand with one foot in front of the other. Put the foot you think is dominant in the back and the other forward. Once you’re on, grab your friend’s hands to steady yourself. Have them slowly roll you in the direction of your lead foot to see how it feels.Then switch feet and try out your other foot as the lead.
Do this several times until you’re sure which stance is the most comfortable for you.

, Make sure to wear a helmet and protective gear. Find a nice, open space where you can work easily. Mount your board very carefully, putting what you think is your lead foot in its position at the back of the deck. Slowly lower your back foot to the ground. Use your back leg to push yourself forward slowly and cautiously.Roll a few inches and then stop. Then try it again.


How does it feel? Are you comfortable? Does it feel natural or awkward?
Now switch the position of your feet and try it the other way. Does that feel more or less comfortable?

, Once you’ve figured out your stance, avoid switching back and forth during practice. Make that your official stance and start learning how to ride. After you’ve worked out your stance, the learning part can really begin because you are able to get comfortable.


Your stance for one board sport will most likely be your dominant stance for all other board sports, such as windsurfing, snowboarding, wake boarding and so on.If you already know your stance, it makes learning another board sport that much easier!

, Start out on a level surface. Get into your dominant stance and practice pushing off. Put your front foot on the board, right behind the front bolts. Think of pushing off as taking a very slow step – lift your (dominant) pushing foot, then shift your balance to your front foot, which is still on the board. Place your pushing foot down in front of your board foot and then push back at the ground.At first, try pushing off and lifting your back (dominant) foot into position at the back of the board. Stay there and ride out the skateboard until it stops on its own. How does your stance feel now?
When you first start out, being on the board feels a little awkward no matter how you’re standing on it. Once your stance is stable, you’ll start feeling more comfortable.

, Once you feel stable after pushing off once, carefully start putting your back foot down when you run out of speed and then pushing off again. Work your way up to ten small pushes.


When you feel you’ve mastered that, add a few longer pushes to gain a little speed.
Make sure you are pushing smoothly and with confidence. You should now feel absolutely sure about whether you are regular or goofy foot.

, Mongo foot is when you use the front foot as dominant and then push off with it while the back foot stays on the board. This is exactly the opposite of how it should be. Your front foot should stay on the board, and your back (dominant) foot should push off. Sometimes when people are first learning, it feels more comfortable to do it the opposite way. If you catch yourself being a mongo foot, try to break yourself of it before it becomes too habitual.
Improper form aside, pushing mongo foot can hinder you in setting up tricks and make you less stable on your board.

Use your back hand to level the board out.,
Place your front foot back on the board once it's level.,
Roll away clean.,
Try some more boneless tricks.",How to Do a Boneless on a Skateboard," Put your front foot in front of the front trucks and place your back foot a bit further back than you normally would, more near the bolts. Ideally, you should have some momentum going before you try the boneless, so it's easier for you to lift the board up in the air and to land back on it. It'll be more tricky to get the board to pop up if you're just standing in place.;
, Bend down a bit and use your back hand, which will be the hand on the same side as the foot on the tail, to grab onto the board just behind the front trucks, and a little bit behind your front foot. Make sure to get a nice strong grip on the board, which is what you'll need to actively lift it up.

, Place the foot on the ground and use the foot and your hand to pop the tail of the board as you would in an ollie, making sure to catch it with your hand. The board should reach midair before you lift your front foot off the ground. You'll have to do some work, using the strength in your front foot and actively lifting the board with your hand to get the board to pop up. You'll have to practice to learn how to quickly slide off that front foot.

, Move your body up along with the board, using your free hand to lift up and help you get some good height going. Keep your other hand in the middle of the board, keeping a firm grip on it, while also keeping your back foot firmly planted on the back of the board as you sail through the air. If you're just starting out, realistically, it may be a bit hard to keep your whole back foot on the board, but you should try to keep at least your toes and the ball of your foot on there if you can.

, Keep your grip on the board and use your hand to straighten it if it starts to veer away from the direction of your front foot. You'll need to position it pretty straight, so you can easily put that front foot back on it.

, Once you get the board level and it's still a few feet off the ground, place that front foot on the board just as you release that back hand, so you can hit the ground clean. When you plant that foot on the board, you'll still be crouched down, with knees bent, which will help you absorb some of the impact when the board hits the ground.

, Once you land on the ground, straighten out by getting out of that crouched position and moving your arms, which should be out away from your sides, to get them closer to your sides while staying balanced. Once you feel steady on the board, you can even try another boneless!

, Once you've got the boneless down, you can try a few other tricks with it. You can try doing it off a ramp or adding some other variations to the regular boneless. Here are some moves you can try:

Cover your ramp with a tarp to give it an extra layer of protection.",How to Build a Skateboard Ramp," Take a look at the space you have available not only for when the ramp is in use but also when it’s not. If you choose to build a portable ramp, make sure you take into consideration any storage issues. Conversely, you may not want to build a ramp if your yard doesn’t have adequate surrounding area for other activities.


The first thing you have to consider is where will you place your ramp when it is in use. Consider the terrain, if there are any obstructions, and if there are any issues that may arise with your neighbors or the city. Depending on how large you plan to make your ramp, your place of residence may have ordinances on measurements or noise so it’s best to check with anyone you may think will be affected.
Consider what happens when your ramp is not in use. For example, will you need to store it and, if so, how will you transport it to and from different locations. If you don’t plan to store it, how much more resources will you have to spend in order to keep it maintained. Most likely you will have it outdoors so you have to consider how weather will affect its use. Moreover, when left outside, will it prevent you and your family from utilizing that space for anything else other than skateboarding.
Some common places to use a skate ramp are the driveway, carport, and backyard.
Ramps can be stored in the open when properly lifted off the ground, sealed and covered with a tarp. Increase your ramp’s longevity by shielding it from the elements;
, Once you’ve got a good sense of the space available to you, plan out how involved you want your ramp to be. Whether you’re a beginner or an expert creating new tricks, the possibilities are endless.


Don’t be nearsighted. Just because you may only be focused on a single trick now doesn’t mean you won’t want to learn new ones. Try to keep your ramp as versatile as possible; however, start small if this is your first woodworking project.
A small mini ramp is good for a limited amount of space and can be built into any shape. A ramp strictly for jumps can be limiting but is great for beginners. A standard ramp conventionally has ten foot transitions, a small staircase and can be used in millions of different ways as you hone your craft., Getting your ideas on paper is the best way to get a sense of how involved this project will be. It will also allow you to work out any practical issues concerning measurements.


Find pro ramp plans online.
Don’t buy expensive design software. Look for free blueprints online, consult friends skilled in design, or go to your local hardware store to start you off on the right foot.Don’t be afraid to be creative with your design; however, be sure not to start building unless you’re truly satisfied with the final design. Repeatedly starting and stopping can bleed your resources and cause unwanted frustration.
When you’re customizing, some experimentation may be needed but be careful not to act without intention. For example, if you experiment and hastily cut off several feet rather than an inch at a time, you may need to start the entire project all over again. This can especially be true when building curved ramps.If you’re on a budget or a beginner, pick a blueprint that matches most of your needs and, after a successful build, consider building a second ramp with customization.

, Use your blueprint as a guide for what tools are needed. Consult your local hardware store in case they have better alternatives. For example, certain types of wood may provide a better surface for skateboarding but may not hold up well to the autumn rain.Purchase screws and wood at any hardware store. Ensuring the length and type are best suited for your measurements and plans.
Consider renting, borrowing, or using your own power tools to reduce time. For example, a power drill with assorted bits would be helpful but not necessary if you just want to use a regular screwdriver. Likewise, a jigsaw would also reduce time if you are cutting any wood down.
If you choose steel plating in conjunction with wood or instead of it, you’ll need to find a local steel fabricator or scrap metal centre in your area. This may be difficult to find in your area, so start your design and customization around what steel is available to you.
Stick to a budget especially if this is your first build. A beginner ramp commonly costs approximately $200 to build after all building materials are purchased but this can easily sky rocket if you factor in power tools, customization, or top-of-the-line materials., While some stores will cut it for you, be prepared to shape your wood to your specifications yourself. Getting a professional will save you time and the hassle of working with power tools so weigh that possibility into your overall budget to help manage your expectations.


Use pressure treated wood. This material is chemically treated for protection against the growth of mould and is fairly waterproof. Consult the retailer for all possible alternatives.Pressure treated wood comes in two colors: a copper green-ish tinge and a natural tone. The only difference is the preservative so choose whatever looks best to you. , Before cutting or shaping anything, remember the old adage.If you’re unsure, do a faux set-up by drawing it out because it’s better to make the mistake on paper rather than ruin your project and start over. Don’t be afraid to ask someone for help.
Don’t be embarrassed about mistakes. You might need to pick up extra pieces of wood, but don’t give up because woodworking is a skill that needs to be developed over time.

, Safety should be your number one priority both when in the process of building your ramp and for the final outcome, when your ramp is in use.


Wear goggles to deflect wood chunks and protect your eyes from sawdust.Wear clothes that fit because loose clothes can easily be caught by tools., Wood won’t last forever, so protect it with a skate-friendly sealant such as Skatepaint, which is a polyurethane sealant that protects from water. Protect your ramp from rain and the elements by giving it a smooth finish with sealant.

, Initially, you’ll be cutting out two side pieces from plywood. These will be flimsy but will be the outer sides of the ramp.Use a pencil to draw out the lines and a jigsaw to cut along these lines if you haven’t had your wood cut at the hardware store.

, Starting with the back support, nail in the four supports found in the blueprint. Be generous with your nails because each nail adds more support to the ramp. After all four supports are attached securely, line up the second side and secure it into the bottom of the supports.Attach the sides of the ramp to a front anchor. It’s vital to make sure, at this point in time, that the frame is level because if it’s not level now, it won’t be after completion.

, Starting at the top, attach your 2x6 and 2x4 eight inches apart, with the 2” side facing up. Attach the 2x6 first, as the removed length from the 2x4 will help maintain a ramp that is flush to the ground. You can also double up on the 2x6 boards approximately four inches from the top of the ramp for additional support for the ramp.
You can also attach a support (two longer 2x4) underneath the 2x6’s because, while it's unlikely they will break, the added support will truly strengthen the structure., Take the two 4” x 6” and place them atop the highest 2” x 6”. This gives your ramp a short but safe edge to stand on. After nailing securely, take your two plywood sheets and attach the upper one first. After it’s securely attached with screws, attach the lower sheet. The bottom sheet should slightly overhang the ramp to create a smooth transition from the ramp to the pavement.Remember to drill the screws from the top down to prevent anything from catching, making the ramp unsmooth.Put screws in every foot starting at the top to ensure a smooth transition between panels.

, Take two sheets of masonite or sheets of skatelite and lay them down atop the previous sheets of plywood. This will be the finished, exposed top of the ramp. After careful alignment, secure them in by using screws approximately every six to eight inches. Remember to start at the top and always screw down into the ramp.


If possible, don’t put the seam of the masonite or skatelite directly atop the seam of the two plywood boards in order to add strength to the ramp.

, When drilling steel, use a drill bit to first drill a hole for the screw. Next, drive in the screw. this will help ensure the screws are flush with the metal. , The first two layers should be ⅜” untreated plywood but the top layer can be Skatelite, Masonite, or you can simply skate directly on Plywood. Choose the top layer based on your budget and climate.Skatelite is the most costly surface as it is used by professionals and is weather resistant.
Masonite is a smooth tempered hardboard that is reasonably priced but is not resistant to the sun and rain so it must be protected.
Plywood is not weather resistant and is unforgiving when you fall but is the most cost effective choice for your surface.

, This particularly needs to be done when just using plywood. Plywood comes in different grades depending on the quality. The quality of the plywood indicates its durability. Plywood is made up of layers and each layer is given a grade. For example, the first letter is the grade of the top layer while the second letter is the grade of the bottom layer.Grade A is the highest grade of plywood with no knots, splits, or cracks.
Grade B is solid with minimal knots and splits. It usually is sanded smooth but may need you to give it another sanding.
Grade C has knots up to 1 ½” in diameter as well as cracks and splits that affect the wood’s integrity.
Grade D will have many splits and cracks. Knots can be as large as 3” and the surface will need to be sanded. Grade D is the lowest grade but the most cost effective.
Finnish Birch is high quality plywood but is expensive and may be difficult to find.

, Whether you are using the highest quality skatelite or more cost effective plywood, always protect your material from the weather.


Skatelite is resistant from the sun and rain but laying tar paper underneath it will protect the plywood base from any water that gets in through any cracks.If you’re using masonite or plywood, protect your surface from the rain with water resistant paint. Use Spar Urethane or Polyurethane Paint. Spar Urethane is the most heavy duty but also the most costly. Polyurethane does not protect as well as Spar Urethane but comes in a variety of colours., Be sure to shovel off any snow during the Winter to make sure the moisture doesn’t seep through and warp your wood.

Think about your experience and interests.,
Pick an appropriately shaped board.,
Pay attention to width and length.",How to Choose a Longboard1," Expect different styles of longboarding to require different levels of skill. If you’re reading this, chances are you’re new to longboarding, so stick with “cruising” for now. This simply means using your longboard as an easy means of transportation over relatively level and smooth ground. As you become more accustomed to this level, you can progress to more advanced forms like:Freestyling, which focuses more on doing tricks rather than traveling distances.
Freeriding, which incorporates more hills and technical maneuvers while traveling.
Downhill longboarding, which utilizes high hills and high speeds and requires very precise maneuvers.;
, Don’t be overwhelmed by all the different shapes that longboards come in. Narrow down your search right away by choosing between designs that are most ideal for the style of longboarding that you’re interested in. If you’re a beginner starting with cruising, you have the most options upfront. However, think ahead and consider what other styles you hope to advance to in order to make life easier, since many designs are ideal for multiple styles.Ideal shapes for cruising include bamboo, commuter, cruiser, drop down, drop through, and pintail.Drop down and drop through are also both ideal for freestyling and freeriding.
Cruisers, speed boards, and top mounts are best for downhill.

, Treat width as the primary concern when considering the board’s dimensions. Make sure the board’s width is no less than your shoe size, since your feet will most often be placed with your toes and heels pointing to either side, rather than its front and back. After that, decide how long you want your board to be. Keep in mind that:The longer the board, the more stable your ride, generally speaking. However, your height is a factor, too. So while taller people will benefit from the longest boards, shorter riders and young children will benefit more by scaling back.
Midsize boards are generally the most versatile and a safe choice for beginners.

",How to Build a Skateboard," Find a large, flat workspace where you can assemble your skateboard. You’ll be dealing with a lot of small parts like nuts, bolts, and washers.


A large work table, or open space on the floor works well. Just make sure that you have enough room to lay out all your parts and tools so you can easily find what you need.
Keep your hardware in the original boxes or packaging until you need a particular piece to prevent losing anything.;
, You can use a regular set of tools such as a screwdriver, socket wrench, and Allen wrench/hex key. The easiest method is to use a multitool made for skateboards which includes a variable size socket wrench, screwdriver, ratchet system, and allen wrench.


You will also need a razor blade to cut your griptape, and a file.
Some skateboard tools come with a razor and a file. If you don’t have one that does, use a straight edge razor or box cutter, and a metal file or sandpaper.

, The deck is the curved wood (sometimes plastic) part of your board that you stand on. The grip tape is the black/gray (sometimes other colored) material that goes on top of your deck to help you maneuver your board without slipping. There are many brands and types of both decks and grip tapes. Some decks come with the grip tape already applied, if your deck doesn’t you will have to apply it yourself.Decks come in different widths and lengths. Most street skate decks are around 7.5” while park decks are around 8.5”. Decide if you plan on using your board more on the street or in a park. Then consider your stature. Shorter skaters with smaller feet don’t need as wide of a deck, while taller skaters could benefit from the extra room.
Some grip tapes are less grippy than others. Grip tape is like sand paper and made of different grains. If you are new to skating, you may want a medium grip and coarseness so that your feet can move easily without slipping., Like decks and griptape, you have plenty of options when it comes to your trucks, wheels, and bearings. The size, width, and height of these components will differ for everyone’s preferences.


A good rule of thumb for trucks is to get ones that fit your board size. You don’t want trucks that are too wide for your board, or vise versa.Wheels are typically made of polyurethane that allow you to grip, slide, and move fast. There are different options for the hardness of the wheel as well as the size. Cruising wheels, like the ones for longboards are the biggest and softest. Small, harder wheels are better for street skating and tricks at the park as they allow for sliding. Then there are wheels that fit in between for versatile skating. Wheel sizes typically range between 49-75mm. Street wheels are typically around 50-55mm. Vert wheels are closer to 55-60mm, and longboard wheels are about 64-75mm.Inside each wheel is a groove where the bearings go. The bearings allow the wheels to spin around the metal axle, which is fixed on a truck. Different bearings will also affect how fast and far you can go. The most common bearing size is the “608”. These bearings fit most wheels as the industry standard. Bearings come in steel and ceramic options. Ceramic bearings typically improve the performance of your board and movement, but are more expensive. If you’re new to skateboarding, there are plenty of steel bearings that will be more than sufficient.Note that trucks are often sold in singles. If you are purchasing trucks online, make sure you are getting a pair.

, Putting grip tape on your deck isn’t very hard, but can take some practice to get it looking great. Start with your deck laying on a flat surface, right-side up.


The nose and tail of your board should be pointing up with the flat part of your board resting on the surface.
Your board may not lay completely flat due to its design.

, Your grip tape will come in a rectangular sheet that is longer and wider than your board. Lay it over the nose and tail of your board before peeling to make sure it covers the whole board. Then, peel off the back portion revealing the adhesive side.


Be careful to touch as little of the grip tape as possible once you’ve peeled the paper away so you don’t accidentally get the tape stuck to anything and ruin it.
Peel all of the back paper off at once.

, Pinching the the ends of tape between your forefinger and thumb, pull the tape taught. Find the nose and tail of your board with your middle fingers. You won’t be able to see the ends with the tape hovering over. Then, find the edge of your board and line the length of the griptape along it so you can lay the tape down straight.

, Make sure to press down hard and remove any air bubbles. Start in the middle of your board and move outwards towards the ends.
It’s normal to have excess grip tape around your deck. Because your tape is a rectangle, and your board is more of an oval, you’ll have to remove the extra tape.

,


If you don’t have a file, use the edge of your Allen wrench.

, Grab a straight razor or box cutter to cut away any extra grip tape. Start in the center of your deck and cut a small incision that’s perpendicular to your board. This incision will make it easier to cut away extra grip tape. Then cut around the entire circumference of your deck.


The easiest way to get a smooth cut is to angle the razor slightly toward the top edge of the board, hold the outer portion of the tape and slide the razor toward you.
Be very careful when doing this as the razor is very sharp and facing you.
Take your time and move slowly.

, Tape a portion of the tape that you cut away and fold it over on itself so the sticky part is on the inside. Then, like with sandpaper, run the tape around the edges to sand the edge of the tape down.


Sanding your grip tape helps to prevent it from peeling up.

, Take your screwdriver or Allen wrench and punch holes through your grip tape. Hold your deck upright and locate the holes on the bottom of your board. Take your screwdriver and punch holes so that you can see where to place your screws. Then, insert your screws down through the top of your board.


Some sets of trucks come with the proper size screws to attach the trucks to the board. Most of the time, however, you will have to purchase screws and nuts separately. Some sets will have two screws which are a different color. Use these screws to differentiate between the tip and tail of your board.
When punching holes, keep the grip tape in place by holding it down with two fingers around the the hole.

, Now place the trucks onto your board. Hold the screws in place with one hand and align your trucks. The trucks attach to your deck at the baseplate. The baseplate is the flat square portion of your truck that has four holes for the screws. If placed correctly, the hanger, the “T” shaped part of your trucks will be facing down. Take the nut that came with your screw and screw it on over the baseplate with your hand until you can’t tighten it anymore. Then use your socket wrench to tighten it further. Once your trucks are attached, hold the wrench in place over the bolt with one hand, and tighten the screws further with a screwdriver from the other side.Make sure your trucks are facing outward. The front of your trucks is the flat part of the hanger. It usually has the logo of the brand stamped on it. You can also tell which way is forward by the bushings. The bushings are the colored rubber parts under the kingpin, the top nut of your trucks.
Both trucks should be facing outward. The flat sides should be facing away from each other with the bushing facing toward each other.
If your trucks don’t come with hardware, you can buy hardware packs specifically designed for skate trucks.
The heads of your screws should be flush with the grip tape when you are done, and you shouldn’t be able to jiggle the trucks at all.

, Your bearings and wheels go on together. Remove the nut and washer from the axle of your truck first. Then grab a bearing. You’ll see a flat side and a ridged side on your bearings. You want the flat side facing out. Put one bearing on the axle, flat side facing up. Take your wheel and press it down over your bearing until you feel the bearing slide into the center of your wheel. Remove the wheel from your axle and slide a second bearing on. Repeat the process, flipping the wheel over.


Place your board on your flat surface and stand the board on its edge for leverage.
When putting the second bearing on, face your wheel out, with the graphic side exposed. This isn’t necessary, and some wheels may have graphics on both sides.
If you have a bearing press, you can attach the bearings to the wheels without using your trucks.

, Place your washer down on top of your bearing, then add the nut. Screw the nut down as far as you can with your hands then grab your skate tool or wrench and continue to tighten the nut. If you have new wheels and bearings, tighten the nut down as far as you can. This will push the bearings down further into your wheel securing the bearing in place. Once everything is tightened all the way, loosen the nut a bit so the wheel can actually spin.


Loosen the nut a few turns and spin your wheel, making sure that it can spin sufficiently.
Grab the wheel with your fingers and pull on it. You should be able to feel and see it move or jiggle slightly.

, With everything in place, place your board on the ground stand on it. Rock back and forth slightly and even skate around a bit. Test the tightness of your trucks and see how well the wheels spin while riding.


If your trucks are too loose and the board feels wobbly, tighten each one. Grab your skate tool and rotate the nut on the kingpin clockwise about half a turn for each truck.
If your trucks are too tight and you have trouble turning or carving, loosen each one. Turn the nut of your kingpin counterclockwise.
Jiggle your trucks again to make sure each one is screwed in tightly to the deck.
Adjust the tightness of your wheels. If you aren’t rolling as well as you should or feel resistance you may need to tighten your wheels further.

,,,,, Stand on the board for leverage.

Pick the right profile for your deck.,
Decide on flexibility.,
Choose whether or not to have a kicktail.",How to Choose a Longboard2," The “deck” is literally the board that you’ll be standing on. Once you settle on what shape and size you want, check how each deck looks in profile. Expect decks to come in either one of three profiles: flat, camber, or rocker. Cambered decks (which rise in the middle) are well suited for cruising, but if you’re interesting in doing more than that, also consider:Flat decks, which are perfectly level from front to back (not including kicktails). These are best for freestyling.
Rockers, which dip in the middle and are better for freeriding and downhill.

, Check whether the deck’s flexibility is rated as either soft, soft/medium, medium/stiff, or stiff. Expect “soft” to be the most shock absorbent (and ideal for cruising), with each rating growing gradually less so. However, if you intend to move beyond cruising, choose:


Soft/medium for cruising and freestyling
Medium/stiff for cruising and freeridingStiff for downhill, Expect some decks to include a kicktail in back, while others don’t. Either one is perfectly fine for beginners, so go with your gut rather than knock your brains over trying to decide between each one. Just know that:Kicktails enable you to make faster turns and more useful if you’re interested in learning tricks.Having no kicktail makes your ride more stable, which may make this ideal if you’re a beginner who’s worried about maintaining balance.

Learn your hardware.,
Match your deck’s width with the right truck size.,
Choose your wheels’ size.,
Pick the wheels' shape.,
Choose a hardness.",How to Choose a Longboard3," Remember that “deck” and “board” can be interchangeable when talking about the literal board in your longboard. However, realize that there are other parts to consider when you’re talking about boards as a whole, rather than a single part. These include:Trucks, which are the T-shaped objects mounted to the bottom of your deck.
Wheels, which are attached to the axels of each truck

, Once you’ve picked out a deck, pick out a pair of appropriately sized trucks to mount to the bottom. Hold the truck upside down so it resembles a T. You want to know two measurements, which are usually expressed in millimeters: the axel’s width (the total distance from one end of your T’s cross-piece to the other, including where the wheels will be) and the hanger’s width (the axel's total distance minus where the wheels will be). Match the following truck sizes to the corresponding deck widths:130 mm hanger / 195 mm axel for decks between seven to eight inches (18 to 20 cm) wide.
150 mm hanger / 220 mm axel for decks between 7.5 and 8.5 inches (19 and 22 cm) wide.
180 mm hanger / 250 mm axel for decks measuring 8.5 to 10 inches (22 to 25 cm) wide.
185 hanger / 265 mm axel for all decks ten inches (25 cm) and wider.

, As with the trucks, base your decision on your deck’s dimensions. Only now, instead of the width, go by its length. Exact length will vary by board, but generally speaking, the shorter your board is, the smaller your wheels should be. As a guideline, consider:60 to 65 mm wheels appropriate for decks roughly 34 inches (0.86 m) in length
65 to 75 mm wheels suitable for decks measuring about 42 inches (1.06 m) long.
75 to 100 mm wheels ideal for decks that are 50 inches (1.27 m) long.

, Select from one of either two wheel shapes: square lip and round lip. Opt for square lip if all you’ll be doing is cruising. Otherwise, go with the round lip.Square lips have more grip on the ground, which makes them more ideal for simple cruising, especially if you’re a beginner.
Round lips are better for more advanced styles because they respond faster when making tight turns or similar maneuvers.

, Look for a rating expressed by a number followed by the letter “A,” like “70A.” This indicates the wheel’s durometer, or the wheels' hardness. Expect softer wheels to absorb more shock and provide more grip, and harder wheels to give you more speed. Depending on your interests, go with:A durometer around 78A for simple cruising and downhill longboarding.
An 86A durometer or thereabouts for freestyling and freeriding.

You would need to make a full size template of the quarter-pipe so that you can use it to mark all of your end supports the same size. 1/4"" plywood works very well for this.


You can hold the pieces together with duct tape, but it's better to cut scab plates out of 3/4"" ply where the seams join together and use 3/4"" wood screws to hold the pieces together.
Rip one sheet of ply in half the long way, well actually rip it to 23 and 3/4"" so you can get two rips from one sheet.
Cut two feet off of one of the rips and scab it to the full length piece. That should give you a 2 feet (0.6 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m) rectangle.
Now scab together a 5 foot (1.5 m) square and hook it to the rectangle so that it looks like a giant boot.
Drive a nail in the top corner of the 5 by 5 square that is not connected to the rectangle.
Using that nail as a pivot, mark the radius from the top corner (where the 5x5 meets the rectangle) to the bottom corner directly below the nail.
Cut this radius out using a jigsaw.(**Caution--use the plywood method for drawing the radius only if you have material to waste. Tip: put a nail or screw at the bottom of your radius, extend your tape measure to the desired length of your radius, use you tape measure as a pencil guide when drawing your radius**);
, To make the end panels, use two layers of 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) plywood which you will laminate together. To laminate the layers, pour wood glue into a paint tray and use a roller to roll a thin even layer of glue over the entire surface of the bottom layer of ply. Lay the top layer down over the glue, turning the grain 90 degrees. Line up the edges. Screw the two layers together with 1 1/4"" coarse thread wood screws. When the glue is set (overnight) use your template to mark out the end panels. Cut them out with a circular saw and or a jigsaw.

, These can be single layer 3/4"" ply, scabbed together using 2 by material. Keep scab plates about two inches in from the edges.

, Use a stop block setup to make sure that they are all cut to identical lengths.

, Nail the other end to the intermediate panel using the same spacing. Stagger the 2x4s between intermediate panels (so that you can nail/screw them). Use as many intermediate panels as necessary to get the overall length you want, and then use the other end panel at the opposite end. You will have to taper the bottom 2x4 to a profile that will fit to the ground.

, Now you need to get this framing anchored to the ground so that it won't tip over. Depending on your situation, you can anchor the back side of the platform to a building, or support beams poured with footings. Consult a professional on how to do this. Sandwich the intermediates with framing and run a carriage bolt through.

, 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) CDX plywood should be flexible enough. You will have to run two layers, in the same direction. Break the seams by running a full course across the length, then run a 2 foot (0.6 m) rip with the grain running the same way on top. Be sure to stagger the end joints as well for added strength. Screw it to the 2x4s.

Avoid the cheap, all plastic boards, which are difficult to learn and skate on.,
Chat up your local skateboard staff for personal recommendations.,
Don't forget the grip tape if it isn't already installed.,
Purchase a helmet.",How to Buy a Skateboard1," Want to shred the skate park or just cruise around town? Looking to grind every bar you find or drop into a halfpipe? Or are you still unsure, and just want to start skating? Your desires as a skateboarder make a big difference on the type of board you buy:



Riding Around Town: Consider a longboard, or an over-large traditional board (8.25"" wide or larger).

Halfpipes, Bowls, and Ramps: If you want to get into big air, look into ""Vert"" boards, which are on the wider side and have a lot of stability. They often have more stylish or unique shapes.

Flat-land & Street Skating: Also known as ""standard"" boards, they are well balanced and have the classic popsicle shape, which is speedy, balanced, and low to the ground for grinds and flip tricks.

All-Around Skating: Usually similar to street boards, all-around skaters tend to use standard boards as well, though different shapes and hardware can be swapped in and out as you get more experienced. For beginners, they may be a tad bigger than a street board.;
, You have two options when you buy a board -- you can get a stock model, with all the components already installed, or you can buy the parts separately and assemble it yourself. Assembling your own board is not difficult, but choosing from the multitude of different components, all of which lead to a slightly different ride, is not possible until you've learned a bit more about your own style.

, The width of a board should fit between a designated range based on your size. Don't worry much about the board's length yet -- this has more to do with style than fit. Almost all adults will want something with a width of 7.5"" or larger, but there are boards for every size:


Under 3'4"" tall -- Get a 6.5-6.75"" board.
Between 3'5"" -- 4'4"" tall: Get 7"" board
Between 4'5"" -- 5'2"" tall: Get a 7.3"" board
Above 5'3"" tall: Get a 7.5"" board or larger., Even pros have trouble skating around on the bottom-barrel, all-plastic boards found at supermarkets and big-box stores. These boards won't be responsive or sturdy enough to comfortably learn on, even at the price they're marketed for.A decent beginner board, with all the components, should run between $50-125. Long boards are on the more expensive end, traditional boards a bit cheaper., Every skater is different, and getting personalized help is as easy as asking. No matter what your experience level or style, getting to know you local shop crew is always a good idea. Many will let you test out different boards or styles before buying, which is particularly helpful if you're lost in the world of trucks, bearings, and wheels and aren't sure which you'd like best.


While you can always buy boards online, it's usually best to buy your first board in person, which makes it much easier to get the right fit and style.

, Grip tape is the black, sand-paper like coating on the top of the board that gives you the necessary control and friction to skate. Not all boards will come with it attached, but it usually comes free and most skate shops will help attach it if you're confused. That said, adding your own tape is easy:


Peal off the backing to expose the sticky side of the tape.
Starting from the side, slowly lay the tape onto the board, pushing out any air bubbles with a stiff credit card.
Use a razor blade to cut away any excess tape so that it fits your board exactly.

, It doesn't matter what kind of skateboarding you're doing, you should be doing it will a helmet. Skateboard helmets are designed for protection from all angles in the case of a fall, and come in a limitless style and color options. When you're buying your first board, don't forget to buy your first helmet, too. When buying a helmet, think about:


The fit. The helmet should sit snugly 1-2"" above your eyebrows, not tilted back on your head.
If you plan to bike, too. Dedicated bike helmets aren't safe for skating and vice-versa. There are, however, hybrid helmets. Any helmet made for both sports will advertise itself as such.
If the helmet is comfortable. If you live in a hot area, get extra vent holes to cool off, and make sure it feels good to actually wear the helmet before buying it."
"
Choose your deck shape based on your preferred type of riding.,
Consider the board's concavity, or how much it curves.,
Choose a wider board if you're a heavier skater and/or want to hit ramps and halfpipes.,
Get a wider wheel base if you're tall, heavy, or want a wider turning radius.,
Get a thicker board for more stability, or a thinner board for a lower weight.",How to Buy a Skateboard2," There are hundreds of different deck shapes, from the classic popsicle to strange, artistic shapes, but they can generally be broken into a few simple categories.


Traditional boards, with two rounded ends, generally have a thicker nose and thinner tail end, helping for flip tricks and jumps. They tend to be the shortest boards.
Long board are generally pointed up top, with a flat bottom to rest your feet on while cruising downhill. This allows you to keep your weight back.
Vert boards, those made for ramps and halfpipes, tend to be longer and wider, and may have unique nose and tail designs or styles., A flatter board is better, in general, for pulling off tricks, whereas a deeply concave board is more stable and easier to ride at high speeds. That said, the biggest factor is your personal riding comfort, so try out a few different concavities as your local skate shop before buying. There are several options not only for the amount of concavity but the shape of it:



""Radial:' The most common concavity, it is a simple and shallow U-shape. Works for any type of skating. ""Progressive"" is a similar shape, but with a more dramatic curvature.

W-Concave: The back of the board is a W-shape, which provides a sharper, more precise board that can turn on a dime.

Flatcave: Allows you to keep your feet flatter, which allows for a smoother, more relaxed ride.

Asymmetric: These boards have an uneven concavity, which usually puts more power in the back of the board for tight or high-speed turning., If you're an adult taller than 5'3"", your board must be 7.5"" wide or larger. But how much larger is generally a matter of style. If you're significantly taller than the average person (over 6"" feet, larger than 225lbs), you should test out a few widths near 8"" to find your comfort zone. Similarly, vert riders almost always prefer something closer to 8"" wide.


Street riders need thinner boards, as there is less board you need to spin when pulling off flip tricks., The wheelbase is the distance between the two sets of wheels (not the two wheels on the same axle). Longboards, which are made for higher speeds and cruising, have wheels that are highly spaced to provide turning support, and street boards tend to be closer together for more control when flipping and grinding. However, there is variation in every board style depending on your personal preferences, so try out a few to get comfortable.


Borrowing friends' boards is one of the best ways to quickly try out a lot of options and styles.
In general, most boards have a wheelbase between 13-15""., Most skateboards are created by pressing seven sheets of wood together, usually North American Maple. However, some companies will use more or less sheets (known as ""plys"") to get either a thicker, sturdier board or a smaller, lighter deck.


Thicker boards (8 or 9-ply) will last longer, and have more stability when cruising.
Thinner boards (5 or 6-ply) are easier to maneuver, especially for ollies and flip tricks."
"
Know the basic components needed to assemble your board.,
Buy trucks within 1/4"" of the width of you board.,
Get higher trucks for cruising and lower trucks for tricks.,
Understand the ABEC system for buying bearings.,
Get harder wheels for tricks and jumps and softer wheels if you love to cruise.,
Get larger diameter wheels to go faster and smaller wheels for more control.,
Consider installing risers to raise the board off the ground and absorb some vibrations.,
Purchase the hardware needed to assemble the board.",How to Buy a Skateboard3," Once most skaters get used to riding and develop their own style and preferences, they need more customization than a complete board can provide. Luckily, assembling your own board isn't difficult, and the complete control over your board's characteristics is worth the bit of extra work.



Trucks: The metal, T-shaped rods that attach your wheels to the board. The width and height of them will depend on your personal skating style.

Bearings: These allow your wheels to actually roll. Bearings come in steel and ceramic varieties. While steel is the most common option, the more expensive ceramics are a bit smoother and tend to last longer.Wheels: The size and hardness of a wheel determines how it rolls, lands, and turns.

Hardware: All hardware sets are is a packet of screws and bolts needed to install everything. This packet generally costs $2-$5., If you have a 7"" wide deck, you should get trucks between 6.75-7.24"" wide. This is measured by the axle width of the trucks. In general, heavier riders will prefer a slightly wider axle, while lighter riders or those who want the lightest possible board (to help get height on flip tricks) will err 1/4"" thinner than the board. If you're not sure, just get the same width -- 7"" trucks for a 7"" wide board.


Some trucks are measured by axle length, and some are measured by hanger width, which is slightly smaller than the axle length. Make sure you double check the specs before purchasing., This is often referred to as the ""truck profile."" These terms are relative, and often depend on your wheel size. In most cases, you should start with mid-level trucks, as they can handle just about any scenario. However, if you do more specialized skating, buy your trucks accordingly.


If you have small wheels (50-53mm), you should go with lower trucks. These provide a shorter board that flips faster.
If you have larger wheels (56mm and up), you'll want to get trucks with a high profile. This provides more stability and smoothness at high speeds., The ABEC rating system tells you how fast and smooth a set of bearings are. They are simple ratings, with five grades: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The higher the rating, the faster and smoother the ride, but the more expensive the bearings will be. All bearings are an identical size, so they will fit any board.


In general, ABEC 5-rated bearings are the best speed for the price. ABEC 7 and 9 are for those that really prize a quick board.
There are companies that don't use ABEC ratings, like Bones Bearings, but they all have their own easy-to-find rating systems to help you out., A wheel's hardness is measured by a durometer rating. This is simply a number and letter, usually ""A,"" with higher numbers indicating harder wheels. A harder wheel is more responsive to tricks, where softer wheels are more comfortable at high speeds.


All-around skaters tend to prefer 90A-97A wheels.
Street skaters tend to prefer 95A wheels or harder. Some companies make B grade wheels, which indicate the wheel is 20 points harder than its A counterpart (ie. 80B are the same hardness as 100A).
Cruisers and longboarders tend to prefer 75A-90A wheels., A wheel's diameter must change depending on your style. The size of a wheel is measured by the diameter across it, in millimeters. They range from 48mm for street riders to 75mm for long boarders. Larger wheels are faster, covering more ground per rotation, whereas smaller wheels sit lower to the ground to make flip tricks easier.


A good starter or all-purpose wheel is between 52-60mm.
Smaller wheels also accelerate more quickly, meaning they are good for combination or trick skating where you need speed quickly.
Testing wheel sizes is always recommended. At the very least, try out a few friend's boards and find out what is most comfortable., Risers are common for longboarders and cruisers, as the make the ride smoother and more comfortable. They can make tricks, especially flip tricks, more difficult, however, because you have to get a taller board over obstacles.


In general, any wheel size larger than 55mm should have a riser attached.
The longer the board and the bigger the wheel, the more height is needed in a riser.

, This simple bag of screws, nuts, and bolts isn't too complicated -- just buy a pack with the rest of your components. If you don't have a riser, you should get 7/8""-1"" length hardware. If you have riser pads you'll need longer hardware to ensure everything can be screwed in. Simply add the length of the riser to your hardware pack.


If you have a 1/2"" riser on your deck, you should get 1 1/2"" hardware instead of the typical 1""."

If you know you can do the trick, do the trick.",How to Become an Amazing Skateboarder," This is the most important thing. If you get scared, chances are you won't do the trick. And half the time, you would have landed the trick the first time had you just committed. So don't ever wuss out. How, you ask? Well, for starters, when you go up to a trick, come up with a word you can use to get yourself to commit. Some good ones are ""Balls Out,"" ""what is so hard about this trick anyway,"" ""Be a Man,"" or ""Just do it."" These should really help you.;
, You will get very bored very quickly by doing the same old stuff every day, just riding, say, a Factor X ramp, or a small flat bar in your garage, or even a set of stairs near your house. Try to go out and do a new spot every day. Get your friends or even parents to drive you and some friends to different skate spots or parks--this way, you can get used to skating a bunch of different things.

, Most skateparks don't have the best street obstacles, and you'd be lucky to have a stair set at the park. Instead, look for skate spots at places like supermarkets and schools. (Namely, Jewel Osco's Shipping Docks work good, and most mini malls have some good stair sets.)

, It doesn't matter if you slam while trying something cool; chances are, you can get back up and try it again. If you break your leg while skating, your friends will respect you for it. Every slam gets you tougher.

, You never know when you'll get bored, and you never know when you'll see a good spot. Better safe then sorry.

,, When you think to yourself ""what if i fall off and hurt myself"" or ""what if i break my board"". Well, chances are you won't hurt yourself and your board's gonna get wrecked (eventually),so get over it. Just think to your self ""I can do this"" and then just do it. And anyway, why be scared of pain? It only lasts for a few minutes, then it's all good again.

Adjust your trucks to however you feel comfortable, especially when you first buy a new board.,
Don't go too far outside your comfort zone.,
If you lose control over your board, either jump off or stop.

,
If you start falling off your board, there are a few immediate things you must do.,
Protect your head at all costs - preferably by using your arms.Owning a bike helmet or specialized skateboarding helmet is preferred for beginners.,
Do not extend your hands to try to prevent the fall.,
Try to not land on your knees unless you're wearing knee pads.

,
Attempt to roll or keep in a controlled falling motion instead of full forced impact.,
After a few hard falls try moving on to something else.",How to Avoid Injury on a Skateboard," The most common mistake is to over tighten trucks. Loosen them up to the point where when you step on your skateboard it doesn't strain or make squeaky sounds (a spot of synthetic grease on the rubber bushings will improve this). Wiggle each truck to check that the wheels cannot touch the board during hard turns - this will cause a sudden stop. Softer wheels are better for cruising the streets, they give a lot of grip, but will distort on heavy landings. Harder wheels will distort less and create less friction with the ground, allowing more grip between your shoe and the deck, so harder wheels are more popular in mainstream skating.;
, A new skater attempting to switch 360-flip on a half-pipe is begging for an injury. Also, try whatever you like... but always be careful.

,, These will come instinctively with time.

, Especially if your brain is still developing.

, This has a tendency to cause long term wrist problems. Try to land on a body part that is most padded.

,, This will help prevent broken bones though it's no guarantee.

Understand the need for bailing.,
Know how to bail when getting a feel for the trick.,
Know how to safely get out of an accidental bail.",How to Bail out of Skateboard Tricks Down Stairs," Sometimes you just bail a trick down sets to get a feeling of what you need to do, other times you really goof up and bail by mistake. The following steps dictate how to bail in multiple cases.;
, Roll up to the stairs ready to attempt whatever trick you want. If you just bail out and kick the board away, then be ready to squat and roll. If the concrete at the landing is smooth, like a skatepark, then you can slide out but be sure that you roll over onto your side or back, because that's more comfortable.

The squat and roll is what saves you from injuries resulting in shock, and from cuts or bruises. The squat absorbs shock into your legs rather than just your feet, and when you roll you should roll onto your side or do some kind of flip over your shoulder, but make sure you're not going to hurt yourself. Practice the roll on flat ground or in the grass.

, If you caught the trick, but kick out for some reason then do the squat and roll, it's your best bet. But sometimes you stick your trick and you feel like you're going to fall off. If this happens, start crouching down so you don't have so far to fall. You may be able to stop yourself with your hands but be careful, your wrists aren't shatter proof. If you stop yourself with your hands try to spin and slide out.

Sometimes during flip tricks or tricks involving 180s and spins you may land primo or land sideways and slam. It's best to spot your landing and make sure you've caught the flip before you stick it. Try not to stop your falls with your hands if you can help it. You don't want a broken wrist.

Talk to your coach about what you want to practice. Remember to start with the basics and work your way up to more difficult moves if it is your first time throwing.
Research each type using YouTube videos or other websites to see some professionals do it. This will help you understand what you are doing.

Get a race belt for your race number.",How to Get Started In Triathlon," You'll very quickly figure out why tri shorts are so popular: if you try to run in your bike shorts it feels like you are wearing a diaper, and biking in your running shorts is no better. A good pair of tri shorts will be well suited for all three stages of the race, keeping you equally comfortable in each without necessitating changes., Goggles will help protect your eyes and make it easier for you to swim quickly with your eyes open. Choose goggles for fit, and consider getting a few pairs with different lens colors to wear when you need more or less shading from light.Wear a swim cap to help reduce your drag through the water and can keep your hair dry. You'll likely receive a free cap from race organizers at your first triathlon.

, Most running shoe companies pretty much produce the same three kind of shoes: a neutral shoe, a stability shoe, and a cushioning shoe. If you are thinking about motion control/stability shoes, work on your running form along with the shoes, although they will help. Having good form and using proper technique while running will save your body a lot of strain. If you're unsure about what kind of shoes to get, visit a local running store. Employees there are generally very knowledgeable about the pros and cons of each type of shoe. They can also help you choose shoes to fit your particular feet.

, New triathletes find this to be the most significant and cost-effective way to save yourself some time.Stretch laces make for a much easier transition off the bike, and you won't have to worry about your shoelaces coming untied during your run.

, If you're just starting triathlons and will be doing no more than a few a year, get a good road bike first - this will carry you through your training as well as your triathlons and be a little cheaper. If you want a triathlon bike, get a good entry-level carbon bike like the Felt B16. While the carbon frame is a significant investment, it offers a huge weight difference from other frames and absorbs much more shock, making for a more comfortable ride. As you get more serious with your triathlons, you can upgrade the components for just a couple hundred bucks, and because you started with such a light frame, smaller upgrades like this can keep your bike competitive for years.

, When you're powering through your bike stage, the last thing you want is to be stranded with a flat tire. Be sure to keep spare tubes and a flat kit on your bike so that if you blow a tire you aren't left stranded. A CO2 cartridge, a lever, and a multi-tool to do on-the-fly seat adjustments or small repairs are also helpful. Keep this kit stocked and ready during your training rides as well as your races.

, As in any sport, safety is your top priority. Get a good helmet to keep yourself safe during the bike stage. There's no need to break the bank - you can get a high-quality helmet for a moderate price - but make sure to get something well-ventilated so that you can stay as comfortable as possible.

, The stiffness and shape of bike shoes will make riding much easier, and using shoes and pedals that allow you to clip into your pedals provide the best pedaling efficiency. Try a couple different styles of shoe and clip before making your purchase, and practice using the clips to get comfortable with them before your first race.

, This might seem unnecessary at first, but it makes all the difference in training. Many training programs use heart rate to monitor effort and stamina, particularly over long distances. You can use this to make sure you're pushing your body enough and training with enough effort to actually get faster, so having a watch or bike computer that measures this can significantly improve how you train. Additionally, monitoring your daily heart rate is a great way to tell when your body needs rest. The bike computer can also help you keep an eye on your speed, which can optimize both your training and your racing.

, Get a couple of cheap water bottles to throw on your bike so that you can drink while you ride. For longer rides, add sodium supplements like The Right Stuff to your water bottles for increased hydration, and make sure to pack some electrolyte drinks for when you are recovering or transitioning between stages of the race.

, If you're uncomfortable, you won't compete as well and you certainly won't enjoy it nearly as much. Use an anti-chafing product like Chamois Butt'r to lube your body and any gear that will be rubbing against you at each stage of the race - for longer races, this can make a huge difference.Pay attention to hot spots in the swimming and biking phases, especially while training, and treat blisters before they become a significant problem.

, Rather than taking time to mess with safety pins at each transition, get a simple clip-on belt that will display your number. Clipping this on is much faster, and this way you won't have to poke holes in your tri kit.

Gear up!,
Work up to the season.,
Be open to finding your strengths as you go.,
Be prepared to work hard!,
Don't be afraid to fail.,
Eat right.,
Don't neglect other responsibilities.",How to Enjoy Indoor Track Season," While athletic equipment and clothing can be expensive, it really is worth the investment to buy a good pair of running shoes and athletic clothes that conserve heat. Invest in hoodies, pants, and tops specially made to keep you warm.


Thermal wear (even ones that are non-athletic) are also very good at conserving heat.
Don't forget gloves and hats.
While most people assume they'll warm up in the cold while running, what often happens is that you may start sweating, and the wetness will become cold because you're running outside. Other parts of your body like your ears or hands may remain cold while every other part is warm, therefore it's best to dress appropriately.;
, If you don't play a fall sport or are out of shape, go running a few times before the season starts. It will be a little easier and a lot less daunting to start running for track if you're already used to a bit of exercise.


Don't run a mile the first day if you haven't ran in months or have never ran a mile at all. Start with short runs and longer jogs. Also alternate between running, jogging, and fast walks.
Practicing a little before the season can also prevent soreness. If you're not used to running so much, your body will be more sore because it's not used to exercise its muscles so much.

, You don't have to know what event you want to do the minute you join track. This applies to you even if you've ran track before or are just beginning, but especially for beginners. You may have the idea that you'll be a good sprinter until you realize you just can't move your legs that fast.

, Hard work sounds gross, but get pumped because that's exactly what you'll be doing for the next few months. Track is the most mental sport in the world, which can make it one of the toughest sports, but the mental toughness you'll acquire will last you a long time. In the end, it is worth it.


Try to like practice because it's the only way you will get better. No special sneakers, music, or coach will automatically make you an amazing runner, only you will. No one likes practice, but you need to not hate it.
Maintaining a positive attitude and trying to get your friends involved in track will help get through the grind.

, Some people never join track or simply quit because they feel they're not good enough. Of course running comes more naturally to some than others, but most people are successful because they've trained to be that fast. Sure, you're behind them, but who says you can't catch up? What you're going through now is what they've probably gone through, you just never got to see it.


Don't compare yourself to others to begin with. Work on bettering yourself first before trying to be better than others.
Track is a very individual sport. That means two things:

You can only rely on yourself,
You don't need to worry about letting anyone down because your performance only affects you So if you do suck, there's no need to have others affect your conscience.


It may help to ease the pressure to know that in many schools, indoor track is not as serious or competitive as outdoor track in the spring. So if you're a great runner, it'll be a lot easier to wipe out the competition. If you're not-so-good, well, no one really cares.

, Your diet completely depends on your body type and even what event you're doing. In general though, always drink water (as in 3 to 4 bottles a day)!


Most people don't eat enough fruits and vegetables, but most people don't play sports. Always aim for a balanced diet.
You will need to eat more than usual when you play sports. More vitamins (mostly from fruits and vegetables), more protein, and more carbs! If your goal is to lose weight, you still need to eat as many calories as you burn or else you will not perform as well.

, Track is a great way to challenge yourself and give yourself a break from academics, but it's supposed to create balance in your life, not a distraction.

Understand javelin.,
Practice running.,
Practice throwing.,
Follow through.,
Run hard.",How to Be Good at Javelin," In javelin you run a length on track while wielding a javelin. You throw a javelin before you pass the white line. The javelin sticks in the air where it lands.;
, Try running a 10 meter (32.8 ft) dash 20 times a day. long-distance running can be used but also makes you want to run past the white line.

, Throw a 10 pound weight as far as you can 10 times a day. You may lower and heighten the weight as you wish. Do overdo it, as the javelin only weighs 2-3 pounds.

, Without proper follow through, the javelin won't go as far and you are likely to pull a muscle.

, When running, remember to run your hardest. You will only need to do this for short while.

;
, Sit sideways so that your board is straight out in front of you to clear ramp. Stand up slowly when your snowboard can touch the ground.








, Allow the chair to push you from behind to give you a boost. While being pushed, lean your entire body slightly forward (the front tip of the board), about 3-5 degrees, just enough to actually put some of your weight forward. This will keep you from falling backwards while moving down ramp of the lift. Look UP and straight ahead. Do not look down at the floor, look where you are going. Don’t try to move on your own. Go straight to clear the ramp.








, Don't hit your head on the chair. Duck a bit and move away from it. If you do fall try to move out of the way as fast you can.

Keep practicing.",How to Throw a Javelin," To hold the javelin properly, you have to place it in the crease of your hand. You need to keep the point of the javelin pointed in the direction you want to throw in. Keep the javelin lined up with your eyes. When running up and transitioning to throw the javelin, look in the direction you are throwing. It has to lie along the length of your palm instead of across from it. You have to hold the javelin at the back of the cord, which is the grip placed around the center of gravity of the pole. One finger needs to be placed beyond the edge of the binding. Just make sure to keep your fist nice and relaxed, not tensed. Beyond that, there are three main grips that you can choose from.The American grip: For this grip, you have to place your thumb and the first two joints of your index finger behind the cord. Think of it like wrapping your hand around the pole normally, except that your index finger is extended a bit more in comparison to your other fingers.

The Finnish grip: For this grip, you have to place your thumb and the first two joints of your index finger behind the cord, while the index finger supports the shaft of the pole. This is like the American grip, except that the index finger is extended further away, and the middle finger is a bit removed from the ring and pinkie fingers.

The ""V"" grip: For this grip, you should hold the javelin between your index and middle fingers, behind the cord. Think of it like making a peace sign and then placing it below the pole.;
, Before you begin running, lift the javelin up above your shoulder so that it is about even with your head. The tip should point down towards the ground slightly, but otherwise the javelin should be parallel to the ground.








Point your elbow slightly forward, while keeping your bicep parallel to the ground.
Turn your palm toward the sky, creating a natural platform for the javelin to rest on.

, After you have the javelin in position, you can start the approach. Begin running towards your target with the javelin. If you are a beginner, then you can just take about 9 to 14 steps. If you are more experienced, then take 14 to 20 steps.As you take your approach run, make sure that you:









Keep your hips high and run on the balls of your feet.
Let your free arm swing across your body.
Flex the arm carrying the javelin to fix its position.

, The withdrawal phase is when you get your body into the proper throwing position. When you're ready for the withdrawal, speed up a little bit and allow the arm that is holding the javelin to extend fully behind you.








Keep your head facing in the direction of your target.
Turn so that the left side of your body is facing your target as well.

, This is also known as the ""cross-over"". This is where you get into the javelin tosser's ""lean-back"" position by putting your right foot ahead of your center of gravity. As you do this, pull the javelin back a little further so that the tip is lined up with your eyebrows.








Keep the right foot close to the ground.
Let the right heel touch the ground.
As the right foot moves forward, move the left foot up and lean your trunk back at a 115-degree angle. This phase is finished when your right foot is on the ground and your left leg is forward and elevated.

, This is the step you take just before you throw the javelin. Move your left leg forward and direct your shoulders and hips towards your target.








Wait for your left foot to touch the ground.
Straighten your torso.
Turn your face toward the direction of the throw. The javelin should be parallel to your shoulders.
Position your throwing hand above shoulder level.

, Throw the javelin when your arm is up as high as possible. Once the left foot hits the ground, your left side must be ready to hold the weight of your right leg, which drives up and forward and brings the hips into a right angle with the throw. You should plant your left heel and thrust forward with your right.








After the hip thrust, pull back with your left arm keeping it parallel to your right shoulder. This will help to keep your right shoulder and chest moving forward and aligning with your hips. As this is taking place, continue following through with the throwing arm with the elbow leading.Move your throwing shoulder over your left leg. Your hand should follow through (the entire shoulder, elbow, and hand should move through similar to a bullwhip acting as one with each section following one after the other.
Lift your left leg and move your throwing arm, with the elbow placed high and close to the mid line. The javelin release angle should account for aerodynamic lift and drag. Experts recommend 33 degrees as the optimum angle.
When your arm reaches the top of its arc, let go of the javelin. Your arm should be over your head, in front of you, and not behind your back, when you release the javelin.

, You have to make sure to follow through after you throw the javelin, allowing your throwing arm to travel diagonally across your body. If you're throwing with your right hand, the hand should end up in front of your left side. The left foot is on the ground. The right leg passes it and then stops you. How quickly you stop depends on how much momentum you built during the run-up. Usually, it can take as much as seven feet (2.1 meters).








You should end up standing on your right foot, with your left leg up behind you. Your right shoulder will turn left, with your chest facing to the left.
People who throw the javelin on a professional level sometimes even fall forward due to the extreme momentum they build up from throwing the javelin and following through.

, If you want to become an expert at throwing the javelin, or just to place in a track meet at your high school, then you've got to keep at it. Training for the javelin means more than just throwing over and over again, which can actually hurt your arm and shoulder; you'll also have to commit to a strength training routine that will build muscle, giving you even more power to throw the javelin.









Remember that it's not the strongest or biggest people on the field who can throw the javelin the farthest. It's the people with the best technique. That said, building up your strength can only help you.

,How to Train for a Triathlon1,
"
Decide what kind of race you want to participate in.,
Sign up.,
Get your gear.To do well in a triathlon, you need decent gear.",How to Train for a Triathlon2," For your first triathlon, you may want to stick with a sprint distance. It's still hard! When you go to sign up, know what you're going in for; the distance varies greatly.Sprint Triathlons: The shortest (though still arduous) varies in specific length, but many of them have around a 0.5-mile (0.8-kilometer) swim, 15-mile (24-kilometer) bike ride and 3-mile (5-kilometer) run.The distances are not as concrete as longer triathlons that have set parameters.

The Olympic Triathlon: This is the most common triathlon out there. It's a 0.93 miles (1.5 kilometers) swim, a 24.8 miles (40 kilometers) bicycle route and a 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) run.

The Half Ironman: This one is a 1.2 miles (1.93 kilometers) swim, a 56 miles (90 kilometers) bike ride and a 13 mile (21 kilometers) run.

The Ironman Triathlon: This 2.4 mile (3.9 kilometer) swim, 112 mile (180 kilometer) bike ride and 26.2 mile (42.2 kilometer) marathon is probably the most famous.

, There are several websites and magazines that can use to search for and register for triathlons, including TriFind.com, Active.com, RaceTwitch.com, LAVA Magazine, and Triathlete Magazine (the magazines are great resources for finding out all sorts of interesting things about triathlons in general).


Before you sign up for a race, you should look into the race details, which you can usually find on the triathlon’s website. For example, is the race extremely hilly or flat? Is the swim in a choppy ocean or flat lake? If you’re a new swimmer, you might want to choose a body of water that is easier to swim in. Some triathlons are off-road, which may appeal to you if you prefer to mountain bike rather than ride on a paved road

, You could go running, biking and swimming in an old Peter Frampton t-shirt and gym shorts, but 10 minutes in and even your skin is going to start putting up a fight. Do yourself a favor and get the right equipment. You'll need:


Swim suit, goggles, and cap. If you will be swimming in cold water, consider a wetsuit. A wetsuit will help keep you warm in cold water temperatures.Be aware that the tradeoff of wearing a wetsuit is that it may hinder your range of motion or swimming stroke. If you’re going to wear a wetsuit in a race, be sure you practice in it ahead of time.
A helmet that fits you and bicycle that is reliable. Road bikes, mountain bikes, and hybrids all work swell. A special triathlon bike or time trial bike isn't necessary, though if you have one, by all means, use it.
Cycling shorts for training. Worn without undies, these will keep your woes from piling up (your legs hurt enough as it is -- why add your butt and skin into the mix?)

Cycling shoes and clip-less pedals have their purposes, but you can make do without them just fine.


A water bottle. This will be your best friend.
A nice pair of running shoes. Don't spend your entire paycheck on them, but do go to your local running store and get a pair that fit your feet properly. The folks will insist on helping you and let them. They know what they're doing."

Know the training stages for building an effective triathlon training plan.,
Plan out your timeline.,

Practice some ""brick"" sessions about a month ahead of your event.,
Consider joining a Masters swim program to become more proficient in the water.,
Build practice triathlons into your training.,
Start with some sprint races.,
Train over the winter using a bike trainer.",How to Train for a Triathlon3," You are going to swim, ride and run. Therefore, each week, you should swim, bike and run. It's simplest to do each activity twice a week, saving one day for rest.


Rest is imperative. Your body needs time to heal. Don't think of it as slacking -- you're just being smart about training.

, There are several training stages that will help you reach maximum success in your triathlon training. The stages are what an athlete Builds a training program around relative to where they are in their training progress. Based on your fitness level, the stages will dictate the kind of intensity and distance that you will engage in. Individuals who are new to triathlon training should at the Base stage and go from there. The training stages include:The Base stage has increasing distance, low intensity
The Build stage has distance maxing, moving toward moderate intensity
The Peak stage has decreasing distance, moving toward high peak intensity
The Race stage has decreasing distance, decreasing intensity from high toward moderate
The Taper stage has decreasing distance, decreasing intensity from moderate to low

There is some taper pre- and post-race, depending on the racing schedule.



, Different types of triathlons require different training schedules and timelines. Your timeline is also dependent on your fitness level and personal lifestyle (for example, if you work a lot or you have a family to care for).


Sprint distances may take 4-6 weeks to train for, while Olympic distances may take 3-6 months.
If you are training for a 70.3 or 140.6 race, be sure to adopt the training stages (base through taper) to ensure that you train properly and safely. Training for these can take 6 months to a year.

, Swimming often constitutes 10-20% of a race, biking often constitutes 40-50% of a race, and running often constitutes 20-30% of a race. When you're training, keep this in mind.


Also, think about the type of race you're running. What kind of water will you be in? Are you biking and running on hills? What kind of terrain? If you can train in a similar state, the race will be a lot less surprising.

, A brick is where you do two disciplines back to back. An example of a brick session is a 45-minute cycle ride followed by a 15- to 20-minute run. This gets you used to changing muscle groups.


Even if you can swim like a fish, run like you're being chased by wolves, and cycle like there's no tomorrow, if you can't do them back to back, you won’t do well in a triathlon. Doing brick sessions will teach your body how to cope when the actual race comes around.
You can change what you’re doing based on the day of the week; you may want to devote one day to swimming, one day to running, one day to biking, one day to stretching, one day to rest, then two days to brick sessions that combine the types of exercise.

, These programs generally accept all levels of skill in the water. Having access to a pro instructor certainly never hurts.


Ask your swim coach where he/she would train and what open water is available for you to practice in. Pools are good, but they're just not the same as a lake or river.
If possible, swim in squares in the pool or do not push off of the walls; you won’t have the chance to rest ever 25 yards when you are in the open water.
Becoming a proficient swimmer will help your triathlon performance overall, but keep in mind that the swim is the shortest (and some would say least significant) portion of the triathlon.

, You may spend a lot of your training time working on the sports one at a time, but you do not want your actual triathlon race to be the first time you bike, swim, and run all at the same time. You can work on transitions ahead of time by doing practice triathlons.


It’s also a good idea to eat and drink while you are training. You can get a snack in after your swim and before your run. Stay hydrated and be sure to keep up your carbs while you are in training.

, This is usually around a ~700 meter (765 yard) swim, ~15 mile (24 km) bike and a 5K (3.1 mi) run. You do not need to set a land-speed record, just use the races as a learning experience. You can use sprint races as a building block for longer races (international, half-ironman, and ironman), or you can choose to focus on sprint races. But you need to race to put all the training together.


Sprints are a good jumping off point. You can never start at the top of the ladder for anything, so a smaller triathlon is a good place to begin. It's also safest for your body.

, In the off-season, you can do a lot of long, steady distance work that will build a strong network of capillaries in your legs that will serve you well in the summer during race season.


As soon as you can, get outside. You'll want to be able to get accustomed to the handle of the bike. Cycling outside is a very different experience than cycling indoors, stationery.

Establish your training in weeks 1-3.,
Increase your distance in weeks 4-7.,
Focus on speed and distance in weeks 8-12.,
Have an off day.,
Taper before a race.,
Listen to your body.",How to Train for a Triathlon4," Your first weeks should be about getting started, establishing a routine, and familiarizing yourself with your equipment. A sample schedule for your first weeks, which are suitable for 12 weeks of training for an Olympic distance race, may be:


Monday: Rest day
Tuesday: Bike 30 minutes
Wednesday: Swim 750 yards

Increase to 1000 yards in week 3


Thursday: Run 30 minutes
Friday: Do yoga for 30 minutes
Saturday: Bike 15 miles and swim (brick training)
Sunday: Run 3 miles and swim (brick training)

, After you begin to be comfortable in your workout routine, you should push yourself by increasing the distance gradually. A sample schedule for weeks 4-7 could be:


Monday: Rest day
Tuesday: Bike 30 minutes

Increase to 45 minutes in weeks 6 and 7


Wednesday: Swim 1500 yards

Increase to 2000 yards in week 7


Thursday: Run 30 minutes
Friday: Do yoga for 30 minutes

Increase to 60 minutes in weeks 6 and 7


Saturday: Bike 20 miles and swim (brick training)

Increase to 25 miles in week 6 and 30 miles in week 7


Sunday: Run 4 miles and swim (brick training)

Increase to 5 miles in weeks 6 and 7



, Now is the time to step up your training by trying to make your swimming, biking, and running faster while you continue to increase distance. In the case of timed workouts, this will mean that you’re covering more distance. For the distance workouts, you will get done faster as you increase your speed. A sample schedule for weeks 8-12 might look like this:


Monday: Rest day
Tuesday: Bike 60 minutes
Wednesday: Swim 2000 yards

Increase to 2500 yards in weeks 10-12


Thursday: Run 30 minutes
Friday: Do yoga for 60 minutes
Saturday: Bike 35-40 miles and swim (brick training)
Sunday: Run 6 miles and swim (brick training)

Increase to 7 miles in weeks 10 and 11 and 8 miles in week 12



, It is good for your body to rest, so even when you’re in intense training mode, try to give yourself one day every week to rest. It may be easiest to have it be the same day every week.

, The one to two weeks before your race, you should work on tapering your training. This means that you will continue to train with the LESS intensity AND for shorter distances or times. If you do a 2-week taper, you should aim for about 20% less workout volume the first week and 25% less volume the second week.You should take the day before the race totally off from any training and stay off of your feet as much as possible.

, When you are training for such an intensive competition, you need to listen to what your body is telling you. This will help ensure that you stay in good health and train safely. Monitor your heart rate. As you get into better shape, your resting heart rate slows down. It should be its slowest in the morning right when you wake up. Try counting your heart rate for 10 seconds first thing in the morning. Keep track every day so that you know your normal rate. If your heart rate is higher than normal, you may be getting sick or your body may not have recovered from the previous day’s training. If your rate is too high, skip training for the day.
Don’t exercise if you have a fever or other symptoms of illness such as muscle aches or chills.
Pay attention to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fainting, lightheadedness or chest pain. These can be indicative of heart issues. Stop exercising right away and see a doctor if you are concerned.
If you’ve been sick, make sure you return to training with patience and reasonable expectations until you are fully well.

However, if you feel that the weight suggested for you is too heavy or light, you may need to adjust the weight to suit your needs. The following list should help you choose a suitable discus:








Women (all levels) - 1 kg Discus
Boys (up to age 14) - 1 kg Discus
Men (high school, 15-18) - 1.6 kg Discus
Men (college) - 2 kg Discus
Men (masters to 49) - 2 kg Discus
Men (ages 50-59) - 1.5 kg Discus
Men (ages 60+) - 1 kg Discus;
, This is one of the most important steps to throwing a discus well, along with holding the disc correctly. Your feet should be a little wider than shoulder width apart. Your arms should both be extended to their full length.









The ideal stance will also have a slight bend in the knees and waist. Think of yourself as a coiled spring, getting ready to release.Throughout your throw, keep your head relaxed and stationary. Your core, especially your torso and shoulders, are key to a good delivery.Practice the chin-knee-toe technique, where you ensure that the knee of your left leg is in line with your toes and chin as you stand.

, If you're right handed, your left foot will be pointed out of the ring at the ring exit. Your right foot will be pointed 90° clockwise from your left one. So, the left foot will be at 12:00 and the right at 3:00.








The stance for left-handed throwers will be exactly the same as right-handed throwers, only in reverse, with the right foot at 12:00 and the left at 9:00.
Try not space your feet too far apart; this could block your wind-up. Think of the foot position like an ""L,"" with your right foot in line with the L’s bottom, and your left with the L’s top.

, The discus cage is a U-shaped net that surrounds the discus thrower.Avoid throwing a disc in an open area if there are people around. Anyone who is watching you should stand safely behind the net.









Even pros sometimes loose their grip on discs at competitions. You should be the only person in the ring and no one should be in the throwing area, otherwise you risk injuring other people.

, Stand inside of the discus circle, which is a 2.5 meter (8.2 ft) diameter circle, towards the back of the cage.Face away from your target. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder width.









As you wind up, your weight should be distributed so that about 60% - 70% is on your right foot., Hold onto the discus with one hand. Place your palm down on the top of the discus so that it is facing the ground. Then spread out your fingers along the outer edge of the discus so they are evenly spaced.








This may go without saying, but if you are right handed, use your right hand. Left-handed throwers will use their left hand.
Don’t grip the discus too tightly. Your fingers should not wrap all the way around the edge of the discus.This will make it easier to throw.
Use your free hand to support the bottom of the discus until you are ready to throw. However, throwing with both hands is considered a foul., Maintain the position of the discus in your right hand so it is face down, with your other hand supporting the bottom. Remember to remove your bottom hand before you start your throw.







, Swinging the arm that is holding the discus and then spinning your body around will help you to gain momentum for the throw. The more momentum you can build, the better.









Most discus throwers spin around one and a half times before releasing the discus.Some throwers, though, prefer to keep their feet stationary., It may feel natural to lead with your left arm, but resist this urge. Lead with your right leg. As you do, drive with your left leg. Keep the discus at shoulder level, your body leaning forward, and your eyes up mid-spin.

You should pick up your right foot to step before your shoulder passes over it. Try to keep your right shoulder behind your right hip.
To keep your left arm in position during this part of the throw, hold it above your left leg as though you’re reading the time.
As your left foot sweeps through the last part of the turn (between 6:00 and 5:00), your arm should stall the discus at about 4:30. At this point, the discus should be at least head height., On the final arc of your spin, ground your left foot in the direction you are throwing. Your right foot will continue to pivot, adding momentum. When the disc is directly opposite the release point, lower your left heel.








At the start of the final rotation of your spin, the disc will be at head level or higher. Turning into the release, the disc will dip low to about your hip. On release, the disc should be as high as possible., This may sound silly, but it may help your release if you pretend you are slapping a person taller than you who is standing directly in front of you. As you come around to the opening of the cage, release the disc.During the throw, never go over the ring line because this will result in a foul. Your feet may touch the inside of the ring, but must not go over it., Check the landing position of your discus. If it's not as far as you had hoped, keep at it. Frequent practice, discus drills, and training will improve your distance. A well-thrown disc should travel parallel to the ground.








, Even if you’re practicing with other throwers you trust, do not stay in the ring with the next thrower. While you’re waiting for your next chance to throw, practice the motions of the wind-up and release. Rock solid form will only improve your performance.








, Follow through with your motions. Interrupting yourself mid-throw may create a stutter in your form. When you’ve got a good feel for the stance and delivery, repeat this exercise with your eyes closed.

Be careful when practicing with your eyes closed. Even if you know your practice area well, a misstep could be painful.
Practicing this motion with your eyes closed will improve your body awareness and help the motion become a more natural reflex., Medicine ball back exercises may be the best place to start, since you can adjust the weight of the balls to meet your needs. Include pullups in your discus training, as these are an excellent back and upper body workout. If you’re really struggling with pullups, get a workout buddy to help you with some assisted pullups until you can do a few on your own.
Even if you can only manage one or two pullups at first, keep including this exercise in your training routines. Before you know it you’ll be a pullup pro.
There are many dumbbell back exercises, like bent over reverse flys, that you can easily do at home.

, Sit ups are a classic core workout, but if you find this exercise uncomfortable, try out medicine ball core exercises. Lunges are a great for core strengthening and will improve balance, too. Other exercises you might try include:


Squats, which will condition your core and legs. The sturdier your core and legs, the better your balance during your wind-up and delivery.Planks will work your entire core and improve stability.Hold planks for at least 30 seconds. Hang in there through the burn. You can do it!

, Running will improve your stamina, allowing you to practice more and longer. As an added bonus, running should also encourage a smoother, more balanced form. Good balance is necessary to keep your throws consistent."

Cable rotations with a side switch —jumping-Every time the hands reach to the high side, jump and rotate 180 degrees, then perform the chop on the opposite side, a degree jump turns landing in stance (performed with or without an agility ladder)



,, Try to find a gymnastics training facility around you that offers a snowboarding program, or just jump with your friends strapped in practice spins flips etc.

, this will help keep your snowboarding muscles working throughout the off-season, and can be extremely helpful. (most summer snowboard camps are fairly expensive but if your serious about snowboarding they may be worth it.

, It sounds silly but it will keep you hyped through the summer, give you ideas of new tricks to try next season, and watching others snowboard will help you learn some awesome style on the hill.

, Wakeboarding is the best board-sport to assist your snowboarding skills. Basically because it still involves carves and being strapped in. water is a lot more forgiving then an icy park landing plus wake boards are way lighter then snowboards helping you learn to form of flips much easier. (Wakeboarding is pretty expensive to but again its highly recommended)

, Skateboarding helps to so try it out. Skating keeps you into the whole boarding mind frame, and helps tons with your ollies and many rail tricks.

Work in strength training into your training schedule.,
Get a physical assessment by a trainer.,
Try circuit training.,
Work on your agility.",How to Train for a Triathlon5," Strength training is a key element in preparing your body to compete in a triathlon. It’s also one of the most overlooked elements. For an endurance race like a triathlon, you need to build muscle strength as well as muscle endurance.Strength training is also important for preventing injuries.
Work in 15-20 minutes of strength training at least 1-2 times per week. Increase this frequency by 10% every week as you work through your triathlon training schedule. Decrease your strength training every 3 weeks for a week to allow your body time to recover., A trainer can help you identify muscle areas of your body that might be weak or that are giving you unnecessary resistance. This person can help you come up with a program for strength training., Circuit training is a series of short, intense exercises that work various muscle groups. This will help you build muscle endurance and muscle strength.


To build muscle endurance, focus on doing higher repetitions with lighter weight or resistance. Do 5-10 repetitions of each of the following exercises at first, building to 20-30 reps as you get stronger: sit-ups, push-ups, squats, reverse lunge, side lunge, and plank hold. Do this circuit 10 times.To build muscle strength, try lifting free weights or machine weights. Perform 15 reps of the following: bench press, triceps dips, pull-ups, seated dumbbell shoulder press, seated dumbbell bicep curl, leg press, standing/lying hamstring curl, standing calf raise, and stability ball abdominal crunch. Try this circuit 2-6 times., You want to make sure you’re performing at your maximum coordination when you’re competing in your triathlon. This helps you move faster and more strongly.Try agility drills to increase your speed and movement, such as box jumps, side touches, and side high knees.


Get an agility ladder to help you with these drills. An agility ladder is a flat rope ladder that is placed on the ground. You can also make one by drawing on the sidewalk with chalk or laying out string or rope on the ground."
"
Fuel up.,
Plan your post-workout meals.,
Have your main meal at lunch.,
Stack on snacks.,
Don't go overboard on fat and carbs.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Train for a Triathlon6," You're doing some pretty intense workouts -- by anyone's standards. It is absolutely imperative that you stay hydrated and you get enough energy (carbs) to stay powered. Always, always, always, carry a water bottle with you in addition to eating the right energy foods.


Calculate the necessary carbs and fluids you will need. Then determine how many carbs are in the drinks and foods you’re consuming. You try to consume 30-60g (1-2 oz) of carbohydrates per hour, but remember that your size, gender, and age may alter what you need. Talk to your doctor and tell him/her what you're doing; they'll be able to point you in the right direction.
Carefully monitor your diet. You need whole grains, vegetables, fruits and lean meats. Stay away from processed foods! You want to carefully control any weight loss to a pound or two a week in order to maintain energy.

, If you don't, you'll probably end up not getting the right nutrition. Generally people fall into two categories: those who don't want to eat anything post-workout and those who want to eat everything in sight. Neither are good for you.


Make sure you have the right nutrition at hand at the finish (pre-planning makes this simple). Chocolate milk, salted nuts, or a peanut butter sandwich are good options to see you through until the next meal., If you're training in the afternoon or into the evening, the last thing you want to do is sit down to a big meal at 9 PM and have it churning away in your stomach as you sleep. Not only will it make it harder to get that much needed shut eye, but it'll lead to increased fat production and weight retention.


Eat a bigger meal for lunch and a smaller meal in the evening. Your evening meal could be:Beans
Eggs on toast
Vegetable bean soup with bread
Sushi and a fruit smoothie



, Don't go more than 4 hours without eating -- you are a calorie-burning machine and thus need (deserve, really) the energy. You also avoid the post-workout binging this way and your insulin doesn't spike needlessly (never a good thing).


Plan your snacks so you never go without food or drink for longer than four hours. Good snacks include low fat yogurt, a small handful of mixed nuts, fruit smoothies, fruit salad, good-quality bars such as Eat Natural or Nature Valley Chewy bars, malt loaf or Ryvita with cottage cheese and tomato.

, You definitely need energy, but a huge part of energy is nutrition. Make sure you're getting the right carbs and the right fats -- not piling slabs of butter on white bread.


Calculate your daily calorie requirement, but be sure to think about the calories you are burning while training., As with all physical exercise programs, make sure you stay hydrated. Strive to drink AT LEAST eight 8-oz glasses of water a day. Soda doesn't count! It actually dehydrates you.

Pick out a good spot to try it out, and probably fall.,
Put on a helmet, just in case.,
Strap yourself in.,
Decide how you will stand going off the jump.,
Go for it.,
Thrust your hands forward (this may be clockwise or counterclockwise, it depends on which way you are standing) as you jump.,
Prepare for landing!,
Start to stop after you completely regain control.,
Once you master the frontside 180, try a backside spin .,
Show off!",How to Frontside 180 on a Snowboard," After a good powdery snow is a good time to try it out, because you will have a soft landing if you fall. Avoid crowds and look for the ability to unstrap and walk up again. In general, avoid ski hills, because you will be in everyone's way. A backyard with a not-too-steep hill is good, just build a small kicker jump on it with a shovel. A ""kicker"" jump is good for learning. This is the kind of jump that is a basic, small ramp.






;
, You could quite easily fall and injure your brain. If you have friends that snowboard, bring them over for support, tips, and for someone to call emergency services in case you can't after an accident.








, Line yourself up to go over the jump, and hit it. Hit it a few times before you actually try the trick. Practice getting a ""pop"" out of your tail as you go off. Do this stuff until you are relatively comfortable going off of the kicker. Make sure you have some good fresh snow next to the direct path, because if you fall, you don't want it to hurt. Also, try going off of it switch footed (backwards in contrast to how you normally stand), because a 180 will spin you halfway around.








, It may be wise to go off of it switch footed and land the way you would normally. Recovering from the jump is when you are most likely to lose your balance, and you have more control when you stand in the way you are comfortable in.








, Strap in, and tell your mother you love her. Move your hands towards the back of your board as you approach the kicker. Now visualize yourself in midair, and imagine how much force you will need to exert to spin exactly 180 degrees. (Don't overdo it! Over spinning will lead to nasty wipeouts onto your back.) Prepare for takeoff!








, Spin your front foot heel-ward, with your back foot moving toward. During the first 90 degrees of rotation, it will be feel kind of like doing a heel-edged stop at first. Make sure that you do not get in front of your board. Instead, stay directly above it, and/or behind it a little, but not too far!








, Finish off spinning, and remember that your board is the thing that needs to be facing downhill when you land, your torso position isn't as crucial. Put your feet down firmly, but don't slam them. Keep your knees bent as you land, locking them will hurt. Put a little bit of weight on your heels to make your board turn a little to counter your momentum from spinning when you touch down. Now is when you could actually fall.








, Be careful, you are probably switch foot right now.








, Backside 180s are harder, because they require you to be temporarily facing uphill. Practice some grabs and try throwing them in too. The sky's the limit now!




, Why did you do this in the first place? Exactly. Now go to an actual ski hill and show 'em what you're made of!

Construct the core block - (a rectangular block of vertically laminated wood strips);
,
Slice strips of wood off the wood planks using a circular saw or bandsaw, all the same thickness and as wide as necessary.

,
Using a suitable wood glue - glue the strips together all the way down the length, evenly lined up together.

,
Use clamps to hold the wood strips together.

,
Remove the excess glue if any, once the wood strips are glued together and dried.

,
Cut it down to the size using the thickness planer.

,
Cut inserts into the core using the centre drill bit in a 4x4 pattern.

Build your kicker on a downward slope.,
Make sure you have plenty of snow.,
Check your landing zone before building.,
Shovel snow into a pile the size you want your jump to be.A snow shovel works best for this.,
Stomp on the face of the jump or whack it with the shovel occasionally as you work.,
Shape the pile.,
Wait for the snow to solidify.,
Smooth out your in-run.,
Groom the takeoff ramp to get rid of any bumps.A grooming rake works best, but you can also use your board, a shovel, or even your hands.,
Add tiny bits of pine branch to the edges of the ramp.",How to Build a Snowboard Jump," Make sure there is enough room to gather speed for the jump. The slope will also make for an easier landing.If building in a flat area, you will need to also build a ramp to gather speed. You can use the same instructions as for the jump.;
, Choose an area with lots of powder. You’re going to be doing lot of shoveling, and it will be much easier if you don’t have to carry the snow very far.

, You’ll want an area with plenty of powder for soft landings. Make sure there are no rocks or boulders buried beneath the snow. Poke at it with your shovel to make sure., As the mound gets bigger, you can interlock two or more snowboards and use them as retaining walls for the sides and back of the jump. For really big jumps, you can make retaining walls from plywood sheets held in place with sticks., This will help to consolidate the snow and expose any weaknesses in the pile., You can use your shovel or snowboard to shape the takeoff ramp. You’ll want an angle between 25 and 30 degrees. The sharper the lip at the end of the ramp, the more air you will get. A moderate lip is better for rotational jumps (360s and 540s). A radical lip (i.e. sharply sloped upward at the end) is better for corks and flips., If you ride on your jump before it has firmed up, it will crumble beneath you. The time it takes for your jump to solidify will depend on the moisture content of the snow. It might set up in only a few minutes, or in cold, dry areas, it might take all night.There are several ways to speed the process:


Occasionally sprinkle on calcium chloride (salt) as you build the ramp. This will help melt the snow so it holds together more solidly. Add just a little as you build: you don’t want your pile to melt. Add more at the end to create a hard surface for your ramp.Make snow bricks and use them to strengthen the walls of the jump. You can use a mould for the bricks, or use your shovel to trim the sides and tops. As you build the walls, fill in any cracks between bricks with snow., Start thirty to fifty feet up the slope and slipslide (slide down with your board perpendicular to the slope) several times until you have smooth, compacted path leading to the jump. A smooth in-run with few bumps will allow you to better set yourself up for the jump.,, Especially in flat light, this will increase visibility and allow you to better judge the jump."
"
Come to the mountain prepared.,
Rent a pair of boots and a board at your local board shop if you've never snowboarded.,
Strap your one foot into the front of the board.,
Push yourself to the ski-lift or bunny slope with your non-dominant foot.,
Get ready for the lift by bending your knees and shifting your weight back.,
Buckle in your opposite foot on the lift so that you can get off easily.",How to Be a Snowboarder Girl1," Snowboarding is not something you can just run out the door and start practicing. You'll need a fair amount of gear to stay safe, warm, and stylish. While the style part is entirely up to you, there is some essential gear you need to have on hand to board. Remember that when getting dressed you can always remove a layer if you get hot. But a day at the mountain is going to get unpleasant quickly if you're cold and underdressed. The basics you need include:


Snow pants or a snow bib.

A snow jacket, waterproof and well-fit but not tight. It should go past your waist to keep snow out.

A crash helmet for protection and warmth. On extra cold days you could put a hat underneath as well.

Thermal layers, such as long johns, sports wear, or thick sweaters, underneath the jacket and pants.

Thick, warm socks. Many people like a thin pair of moisture-wicking athletic socks under a thicker pair of warm socks.

Snow gloves that can be tightened around your wrist to prevent snow from entering (gauntlet cuffs).

Skiing or snowboarding goggles, to reduce glare and protect your eyes from particulate matter.

Boots and a board, though these can be rented at the mountain if you're new to boarding.;
, Nearly all mountains have a rental center as well, and they will fit you to the right board and boots. Snowboarding is not difficult, but it is expensive, so it is best to rent a few boards and try them out as you learn before spending money on a board.


There are many different boards and styles on the market, so picking out one now, before you know what you want out of a board, may end up in wasted money.
Let the rental center know that you are brand-new to the sport. They will take the time to measure you up, ensuring your first board fits you well.

, If you're right footed, usually your left foot goes into the front binding of the board so that your toes are pointing to the right. Make sure your heel is all the way back in the binding, then tightly clasp the bindings. Your dominant foot will be used to push you around, much like you were skateboarding, but you will lock it in before you start really snowboarding.


If you're confused about what foot to put forward, put on a pair of socks and slide on a wood floor. Or jog up to a set of stairs and see what foot you step up with first. The foot you put forward here should be forward foot on your board.There are a variety of binding styles, but most of them use clasps or buckles and are easy to figure out. For beginners, try and get the bindings angled slightly forward.

, Unless you're taking a break, you will rarely need to unbuckle your front foot. Simple push off your free foot to ""skate"" around the mountain, getting you to the lifts so that you can head down the mountain.


If you have a stomp pad, which is a grip-y, small rubber patch in the middle of your board, you can rest your free foot on this if you need to glide down small hills without buckling it.

, Getting on the lift is a bit intimidating at first, but all you're really doing is letting the lift scoop you up. Once you're in line, just bend your knees slightly, transferring your weight towards your butt like you're about to sit down. Once you feel the lift hit the back of your knees, just drop down like you're about to sit.


Many beginner slopes have a ""Magic Carpet"" instead of a lift. This looks like a flattened escalator, and all you do is step on it so that it drags you up the mountain with ease.

, While riding up buckle your free foot in, even if it is only lightly. As you approach the top, angle the board so that it faces forward, then simply stand up once the lift reaches the top. The momentum of the lift will push you forward and out of the way, then you can just let yourself glide down the slope at the top of the lift towards the top of the mountain.


If you have a stomp pad you can use that instead of buckling the back foot.
You might unbuckle again after you've gotten off the lift, then ""skate"" your way to the top of the slope."

Before you attempt a backside 360, make sure you are very comfortable hitting jumps on a snowboard and being able to do a backside 180 would help too.,
Find a jump on which you can do your backside 360 on.

,
Hit the jump a couple times so can get a feel for it and know what speed you will need to clear it.

,
Once you are ready, get totally committed mentally and physically to doing this trick.

,
Approach the jump with enough speed to clear it.

,
As you approach the jump bend your knees and wind up your shoulders.

,
As you are about 3/4 up the jump start to release your shoulders to give you spinning momentum and pop your board.

,
At this point, you'll be in the air.

,
Keep your head and shoulders pointed in the direction you want to spin.

,
While doing your 360, throw in a grab.,
As you are finishing your 360 rotation look towards the ground and spot your landing.

,
Get your board parallel to the ground and stomp your landing.

,
Ride away with style.

",How to Backside 360 on a Snowboard," Also it would be very helpful to practice doing 360s off small bumps on trails, so you can get used to the motion. Make sure to check out videos of people doing backside 360's, by checking out my website. So lets begin.;

Adopt a comfortable, athletic stance.,
Learn to edge.,
Push down on your front foot to head down the slope.,
Practice basic stops.,
Turn by leaning into an edge with your feet and torso.,
Practice until you can edge on a dime.,
Remember that your first day of boarding is all about comfort, not looking impressive.",How to Be a Snowboarder Girl2," When boarding you want to make sure you are always in full control. While you'll bend and lean as you ride, you need to start all of your movements from a strong and athletic position to really act like a snowboarder girl. To do so:


Bend both knees slightly, like a soccer or basketball player in a defensive stance.
Keep your shoulders down and over your feet.
Have your spine straight and your torso upright., Edging is the most important skill for a snowboarder, and it is simply when you dig one edge of the board into the snow, as this is how you turn and control speed. Most of your time going down the mountain will be spent on edge, so get used to this now. To practice the balance needed for edging:


Shift your weight forward, over your toes.
Stand up a bit, like on tip-toes, so that you can feel the heel side of your board picking up.
Hold your balance on the edge as long as you can. Switch sides and try it on your heel edge.
This can be done on flat ground or gentle, beginner slopes. If you're worried about balance, unbuckle your back foot and use it to catch yourself when you fall., Once you're comfortable with some edging it's time to ride. Set up on top of the the beginner slope, which is generally wide, slow, and has a large flat bottom to help you stop slowly. A lot of riders like to sit on the edge and bind in, then stand up with the board facing down the hill. Push down on your front foot, like you were smashing a bug, and let gravity do the rest.


Keep your athletic stance as you head down the mountain. Knees slightly bent, torso straight, head up.
For the first 1-2 runs, don't worry too much about turning. Simply get used to heading down the mountain., As you come down to the end of the mountain, put light pressure on your heel or toe edge. Feel yourself start to turn and slow down. Practice on both edges, using the flatter part near the bottom of the slope for the most comfortable practice.


Get used to both edges. How long does it take to stop when on your heel edge? What about your toe edge?
As you get comfortable, start edging further and further up the mountain. Edging takes you across the slope, naturally slowing you down, and is the building block of sharper turns., Once you feel good edging on both sides, it is time to start turning. As you head down the mountain, lean into the edge you want to turn towards (leaning towards you heel will turn you towards your heel). As you do, rotate your shoulders towards the turn as well, which opens up your body and moves some weight over to the side you're turning.


Start on one side of the mountain and practice heading down diagonally, working on this turn as you feel comfortable. Practice on both sides.
Once you feel comfortable with both sides, try changing direction. Slowly lean off your heel edge and lean towards your toes, rotating your shoulders along with you., As you get more comfortable you'll pick up speed on your turns and stops, quickly shifting from edge to edge. You should be able to zig-zag down the hill eventually, showing that you have the control to turn and stop on a dime.


A full stop is just an extreme ""heel-edge."" You lean so hard into your heel edge, so quickly, that you whip the board around horizontally. This digs the heel edge of your board into the snow to stop it.

, Very few people look good on their first day of boarding. The sport can be incredibly frustrating if you expect to look like a life-long snow bunny on your first runs. Focus, instead, on board comfort, getting used to basic riding, turning, and stopping so that you can move fluidly anywhere on the mountain. The tricks, speed, and flash will only come after you've mastered these basics.

Know that a snowboard girl is simply a girl who snowboards.,
Buy your own board.,
Find amazing snowboarding role models.,
Learn some snowboarding styles.,
Avoid makeup on the mountain.,
Watch snowboarding videos to get ideas for tricks, styles, and subculture.",How to Be a Snowboarder Girl3," That's it. While the snowboarding world is typically male-dominated, there is nothing special you have to do or wear that makes you a snowboard girl. Just go snowboard. Get to know the trails on your mountain, find a board you love, and spend time out on the snow whenever possible. If you get out there and ride, you're a snowboard girl.


Snowboarding is slowly becoming a more accessible culture to join into. That said, most snowboarders still have little time or respect for ""posers,"" or people who wear snowboard styles but never actually board., Get an ""all-mountain board"" if you are a beginner. All-mountains can be used for slopes and terrain parks, and they blend speed and maneuverability well. This makes them perfect for new riders.



Size: Stand the board up on its end, so that the top reaches between your nose and chin.

Directional Twin-Tip Both ends are almost identical, rounded tips.

Camber Type: Beginner riders should try a rocker-style board (the profile of the board curves upward) because of the added maneuverability and turning forgiveness., There are many amazing women of snowboarding that can carve a mountain with the best men any day. Watching snowboarding and finding women you can look up to is a great way to see snowboard girls in action.


Watch the Winter Olympics and X-Games, where snowboarders of both genders are often some of the main attractions.
Check snowboard blogs, specifically those revolving around women boarders like Burton Girls., Though it is almost completely cosmetic, snowboarders and skiers have traditionally worn different styles on the mountain. Snowboard style is directly influenced by skateboarding and street styles, often featuring brighter colors and bold, graffiti/urban-inspired designs. You should, of course, wear what you like, but snowboarders typically aim for alternative or youthful clothing.


Snowboarding initially adopted a lot of influences from punks and rock culture but has since involved to include a lot of hip-hop influences.Check out the latest styles from brands like Burton, O'Neill, Thirty Two, and more., Snowboard girls aren't there to pose, they are there to ride and enjoy themselves. Makeup is not only unnecessary, as it will be mostly covered up by goggles and hats, it will more than likely be smeared off within 1-2 runs. Sweat, snow, and the occasional fall are going to get you a little dirty, but that's half the fun. Save the makeup for the after party and focus more on your boarding than your looks., There is a rich snowboarding culture out there, and most of it is shared through videos and compilations. At one time, this involved sharing and copying old VHS tapes, but today's snowboarding girls can run to YouTube to watch amazing boarders at work. This is the best way to inundate yourself in snowboard culture. Watch and share your favorite videos with friends, try and replicate some of the tricks as you get more advanced and take style tips when you see something you like.

Approach with the proper stance.,
Regulate your speed.,
Pop your board if necessary.,
Stick the landing.,
Exercise for endurance and flexibility.,
Stretch for safety and better execution.,
Try yoga for snowboarders.,
Take up an aerobic exercise.",How to Freestyle Snowboard," As you develop your skills, you'll likely learn tricks for the park, the pipe, or even extreme park tricks that make use of extra large jumps.But each of these areas can benefit from specialized boards, so it may be best for you to choose a single area in the beginning and branch out.


As extreme park tricks can be both intimidating and dangerous for a novice, you may want to begin with park or pipe tricks.;
, The main qualities most freestyle boards share are soft to medium flex, a true twin (perfectly symmetrical) shape, a shorter than standard length, a wider width, and a centered stance.However, depending on what tricks you'll be pursuing, there is some variance.


Freestylers who enjoy tricks in a half pipe will probably want to consider a board with medium flex.
Boarders in the park (especially those who prefer jib tricks) might benefit from medium-soft to soft flex in their board., Doing a little bit of reading beforehand can accelerate your learning, and may give you important tips on weight distribution, approach, and execution of various tricks. Basic tricks include jumps, grabs, and spins.A more complete list of tricks, including diagrams and judging specifications, can be found in the United States of America Snowboard and Freeski Association's freestyle manual, available here.

, Imagining yourself performing the move, considering how your weight might shift and your muscles work to execute the move you have chosen, will help prepare the muscles in your body for the real thing.Utilizing this ability can not only help your boarding improve quickly, but it will help calm inner doubts you might have when approaching new tricks.

, Having the right stance when performing a jump/jib will give you better control when you leave the ground. Your trajectory through the air is determined mostly by your launch. If you go into a jump or jib unbalanced, it will be difficult for you to regain your balance.Make sure that your body is relaxed, with your knees slightly bent and your back straight.
Keep your knees, hips, and shoulders aligned in the same direction as your board.
Equally distribute your weight between both of your feet.
Keep your hips central, your head up, and your view on your intended path.
Point your leading hand slightly in the direction you are traveling to maintain your upper and lower body alignment.

, Take note of the speed at which other riders hit the feature you want to approach and try to attack it at a similar speed. You should plan an approach to the feature that doesn't require you to make significant speed changes.


While learning the body physics behind a jump or jib, you should try to keep your body movements to a minimum to avoid throwing off your balance.
It's important you carry enough speed to clear the flat section of the feature before landing on a transition. This will help to minimize your impact.

, To pop your board, you should bend your knees slightly more than you normally would and push back with both legs evenly as you ride up to the lip of the feature. If you are performing a jump, once you are airborne, keep your eyes focused on where you will land, bringing your knees in to make your body more compact so that you have greater control.When you pull your knees in for a jump, try grabbing your board. This can help reduce movement in your upper body that might throw you off balance.

, Your ideal landing will be even, with both feet on a flat base. You should make a small turn onto your edge to help you regain control and curb your momentum. Your impact can be absorbed by flexing down with your knees and ankles at the moment of impact.You should avoid sliding a turn down down your landing or slowing down too much as you land. This can create ice or rough snow for other riders. Maintaining enough speed will also help prepare you for the next feature or the rest of your run.

, Your ability to do tricks will rely a great deal on your flexibility, so bulking up unnecessarily in the off season with strength training might hinder your ability. Improving your endurance will help you hit the slopes for a longer period of time, resulting in more practice which, in turn, will lead you to better freestyling.To prevent injury and improve performance, it is recommended you train the following areas in the off-season:
Flexibility
Core Strength
Leg Strength
Balance
Shoulder Strength, The bending, twisting, impact, and tension you experience while on your board, especially in your legs and core, can leave you sore or give you muscular tightness. It can also result in injury if you're not properly warmed up.Help prevent these by stretching out before you spend a day on the slopes.

Do some jump squats, Yoga, being a system of poses and postures aiming at giving you both awareness and control over your body, is an ideal exercise for snowboarders of all types.Some poses you might want to try:



Horse Riding Stance: spread your legs so that your hips drop into a squatting position, point your feet outwards, keep your spine erect and your pelvis slightly tilted while trying to maintain a right angle between your thigh and lower leg.

Hero Pose: bend your knees and recline your body to lay flat on the ground, keeping your feet to close to but on either side of your body and placing your arms above your head until your shoulders and upper back rest on the floor., This will help with stamina and keep you in boarding form while waiting for snow season. Something as simple as jogging or cycling can make your return to the slopes seamless and easy.

"
"
Start out on your heel side with your knees bent outwards.,
Keep your hands out to your sides.,
Slide down the hill a bit on your heel until you are comfortable with the trail.








,
Flatten board by removing weight off of your heels and let board start to point downhill (Regular: Left, Goofy: Right).








,
When board is pointing downhill look where you want to go and transfer weight to front foot toes first then back foot toes and look up the hill as turn is made toeside.








,
Your edge will come around so that you are now on your toe edge, facing up-hill.








,
Now that you are on your toe edge, you need to make another turn to bring you back to your heel edge.,
Your edge will come around onto your heel side and you will be looking downhill.








",How to Do a Snowboard Turn," Not too much though, or you'll have a tough time riding. You should be leaning on your heel a comfortable amount; not too much to inflict painful pressure on your legs.






;
, This will help you balance. Lean your weight on your back leg.








,,,,, Slowly transfer weight off of your toes and bring board flat and pointing downhill. When board is pointing downhill look to where you want to go and transfer weight to front foot heel side first then rear foot heel side.









To turn left, you slowly lean on your heels lifting your toes in the air slightly. To turn right, you lean slowly on you toes and lift your heels slightly.

The deck is the horizontal platform at the top and edges of the halfpipe.
The entry ramp is a sloped area from where you will start riding the halfpipe at the very top.
The flat is the center flat area of the halfpipe.
The lip is the top edge portion of the wall of the halfpipe.
The verticals are the areas right below the lip. They are straight up and down on the sides of the halfpipe.
The transitions are the area between the flat and the verticals where the flat begins to slope upwards.;
, The best snowboard for use on the halfpipe will have a couple key characteristics that are different from snowboard for freestyle. Both the snowboard and snowboard boots for the halfpipe should be a bit stiffer than typical freestyle boards.


The tail should also be particularly stiff to create a bigger pop off the rim.
Snowboard boots should be stiffer to provide extra power and protection in the halfpipe.
Set up your bindings so they are a few centimeters back from where they usually are so that you have more nose than tail. This will help you get more power from your back foot when attempting jumps.
Lean your bindings forward by angling your ankle cups forward slightly. This will keep your knees bent and help you to better hold and edge while in the halfpipe.Wax your board so you land your tricks cleaner.

, There are some terms to learn with regards to snowboarding in the halfpipe. These include backside spin, frontside spin, frontside wall, backside wall, switch and grab.


A backside spin is when a snowboarder turns their back into a spin first. His shoulders will close so that his/her backside is the first side of his/her body going forward off the jump in the first 90 degrees of rotation.
A frontside spin is when a snowboarder turns their chest into the spin first. In a frontside spin the snowboarder will open up their shoulders so that the frontside is the fist side of their body going forward off the jump in the first 90 degrees of rotation.
The frontside and backside wall will depend on which way the rider is going up a wall. When a snowboarder goes up a wall on their toe side then the wall they are currently ascending is the frontside wall. The backside wall will be the one that the rider goes up while on their heel side (backside).
Switch refers to riding backwards from the direction a snowboarder typically rides. This is also called fakie or switchfoot. For example, if a snowboarder usually rides with their left foot forward then riding switch will mean that their right foot is forward.
A grab is when a snowboarder grabs their board while in the air., A “falling leaf” involves going back and forth like a pendulum while going down a hill. You should be able to do this on both your heel side and toe side. As an intermediate snowboarder, you should have already learned to do this.


If you are a beginning snowboarder you should practice this before attempting the halfpipe.

, You must be able to carve properly in order to try the halfpipe. Beginner snowboarders will make skidded turns that make a wide path through the snow. These turns where the tail is being dragged significantly slow down the snowboarder. Carving will cut a clear path from front to back without this lateral slide, making the rider faster and more powerful.


Carving a turn will create a “C” in the snow.
Practice carving by imagining you are on very narrow runs and cannot make wide turns. Halfpipes are very narrow so being able to cope with this narrowness will help you feel more comfortable.

, You should be able to ride comfortably both with your regular foot in front as well as switchfoot, or with your other foot in front. Therefore, if you normally ride with your left foot in front, make sure you can also snowboard and keep your balance with your right foot in front.


In the halfpipe you will be changing your front foot from time to time so it is important to be able to snowboard both directions.

, Ollies are basically jumps while on the flat or slight hill. These will teach you how to gain power for jumps in the halfpipe as well as help with maintaining balance while landing. Ollies should be performed when you are on the flat of your board rather than an edge so that you do not fall.


To do an ollie you should first lean backwards while lifting up your front foot.
After your front side is slightly in the air you will push off when your back foot. This will pop you into the air by releasing the flex of the board that you created while lifting your front foot.
Pull up your back foot to make the board level once again. Your knees should be pulled up towards your chest.
Bend your knees while landing to cushion the fall. You should land with your front foot first and your weight slightly forward.

, Wear a helmet while learning how to use the halfpipe. The halfpipe can be quite difficult to learn and you will fall many times while practicing. Keep yourself safe by wearing a helmet.


You can also find additional body armor if you are particularly worried about injuring yourself. Use your judgment with regard to protecting your health and body.

, There are certain considerations regarding etiquette in the halfpipe. You should wait your turn and never cut off another snowboarder who is riding through the halfpipe. Be nice to other people and don’t tease others who may be struggling.

, Take a run or two at least before trying the halfpipe. You want to be limber and warmed up before attempting the halfpipe.

, While you can usually take the lift, it is better to hike because this will strengthen you and your legs. You will need strength and power to ride the halfpipe so hiking will help you get in shape.

, This protects you from injury because you can seriously injure yourself if you drop in from a wall improperly. Most halfpipes will have an entry ramp at the top, which makes it easier to get into the pipe safely.

, Traversing means that you will go back and forth down the halfpipe while keeping your shoulders facing uphill. Face the direction that you are going, using your arms to keep your balance. This is very similar to the way you first learned how to snowboard.


Stay on your heel edge and go right and left up the walls while swinging your arms in unison like a pendulum of a clock. While in the flat you should let your board remain straight and flat.
Don’t try to get air the first times you try the halfpipe. Simply try to move right and left while keeping balance and stability.
Make sure to maintain your balance and stability by keeping your knees bent while landing.
This will be similar to the falling leaf exercise except you will be going up the sides of the halfpipe.

, Going straight across will make you lose speed but to gain height in the halfpipe you will need a bit of extra speed. You can also get extra speed on the flat by pumping your legs. This means you bend them then straighten them into the wall. Extra speed means extra height.


Speed is everything in the halfpipe so make sure you keep your speed up while snowboarding the halfpipe.

, The halfpipe is quite difficult so you must be patient with yourself and stay relaxed. Being relaxed and loose is one of the most important aspects of riding correctly in the halfpipe. Be patient and don’t get upset if you can’t get above the lip at first.


Start out by going only slightly up the walls of the halfpipe. Don’t expect to get above the lip on the first day.
While it is good to push yourself you also do not want to cause injury. Know your limits.

, Once you are feeling comfortable traversing the halfpipe you can try making slide turns. Slide turns mean that you will be going up the wall on one edge and coming down on the other edge. Go higher and higher when you are feeling more comfortable.


For example you will be turning from heel edge to toe edge, keeping your same foot in front.

, Once you are starting to feel comfortable you will likely begin to get a little air off the lip of the halfpipe. Let this air come naturally when it happens and keep working on making a turn in the air to land with the same foot forward. Allow your body to move downhill naturally while in the jump.


A common mistake made by beginners is to land straight below where they take off on their downhill edge and readjust to angle their board slightly downhill on their uphill edge, creating a double turn. You rather want to allow your momentum to carry you forward while in the air, landing downhill from where you took off. This will create a rounded line for your path through the halfpipe.
When you are in the air bring your knees to your chest for optimum balance and landing ability., Keep your knees bent in the landing and pay close attention to where you land. You do not want to land on the deck or the flat, where you can easily injure yourself. You should land instead as high in the transition as possible to maintain speed into the next wall of the halfpipe.


You want to land with your body weight on your front foot to help carry you properly into the next side.
The most important aspect in landing is confidence. You must be aggressive to land properly with your weight on your front foot. Be confident and let the transitions carry you up and down each wall.

, An air to fakie means that you do not turn in the air to land your jump with the same foot in front. This a bit like when you did you traverse, except you are getting air off the lip of the halfpipe. This trick is harder than it looks so start with very small jumps when just beginning.


Approach the lip straighter than if you would when turning to land with the same foot in front (the frontside air, like when you were doing slide turns).
Turn your head back past your tail before you land to figure out when you need to extend your legs to make contact with the wall.
Practice grabbing either the tail of the board or between your feet on the front edge while you are in the air. This is called a grab and requires some height before it can be completed easily. Do not grab between your rear foot and the tail on the front edge of the board (tindy)., An alley oop basically refers to any spin (180 degrees or larger) in which the direction of spin is back up the halfpipe. Try a backside alley oop at first. This will be when you are going up the wall on your toe edge and turn uphill 180 degrees before landing with your same front foot forward.


The backside alley oop is similar to when you do a normal air except you are turning your body in the opposite direction.
Rotate your head and shoulders to initiate the spin and try to land downhill as normal rather than uphill or right below the jump.
Grabbing the board will help you turn easier, but do not grab tindy (between your rear foot and the tail of the board).
Release the board and make sure it is flat again when approaching the lip on the descent.

, This will be easiest from your toe edge and is not much more of a spin than your normal frontside turn from your toe edge to heel edge. As you approach the wall on your toeside and leave the lip, rotate your head and lead shoulder extra far. This will initiate the frontside 360.


As you turn your head and shoulders make sure you are looking directly down the pipe so that you can land nice and straight into the transition.
Try to land very slightly on your toeside edge if possible.
You will land with your opposite foot forward (switchfoot or fakie).

, A cab 360 is basically a switch frontside 360-degree turn where you land facing forward. As you are coming up the transition pre-wind your shoulders slightly up the pipe and then unload that rotation as you leave the lip, rotating your shoulders in the opposite direction, frontside.


Try not to spin too early or else you will lose your pop off the lip. Hold your edge all the way up the wall and then only spin once you are in the air.
You can add a grab into your cab 360 for extra flair if you are comfortable. For example you can grab the tail of your board.
The benefit of this trick is that you land facing forward so it is great for getting your regular foot back in front after another trick.

, This is basically the same as a frontside 360 but with an extra half-turn. Turn into the jump with your shoulders moving downhill (frontside) and do one and a half turns, landing with the same foot forward.


You will need more pop off the lip with extra air and a bit more snap with your shoulders and core compared to the frontside 360.

, Backside 540s are much more difficult than frontside 540s because they are completed from your heel edge, which is harder to pop off of than your toe edge. As you are going up the wall on your heel edge, pop off your heel edge with your shoulders snapping you around backside and complete one and a half turns.


You will land back with the same foot forward.
Go into the jump with a good amount of speed for extra pop and a little straighter than for a frontside 540 so that your board can flatten out and give you more of an area to pop off.
This jump is much more difficult than the frontside 540 so make sure you are comfortable with all the other jumps before attempting.
The backside 540 is actually a bit easier than the backside 360 because with the backside 360 you land switch, meaning you will be ready for a backside switch hit on the next jump. Backside switch hits are quite difficult to accomplish so it is better to try the backside 540 than a 360 first.

Make sure you're comfortable riding switch.,Find a small jump which has just enough rise for you to pop off of

,
Approach the jump straight.,
Just before reaching the lip of the jump, apply slight toe-side pressure.,
Pop off the lip, going straight.,
You'll be flying through the air backwards, but don't freak out.,
Look between your bindings to spot the landing.

,
Once you spot your landing, rotate the final 90 degrees.,
Land switch, bending your knees.,
Practice, practice, practice!

",How to Do a Backside 180 on a Snowboard,"  You should be able to land straight-airs while riding switch.;
,,  You may do some set-up turns before hitting the jump, but once you're on the ramp, make sure you're heading straight.

,  Be sure not to turn (i.e., keep going in a straight line!), just apply a small amount of toe-side pressure. The 180 is a small rotation, so you don't need to load the rotation before you leave the lip as some people do with larger rotations.

,  Your first split-second after leaving the lip should feel like a straight air. Turn 90 degrees towards your backside (clockwise for regular, counterclockwise for goofy), keeping your knees sucked up as high as you can. Tip #1: just after you pop off the lip, keep looking straight for a split second. This will help give you a sense of the trajectory of the jump and the timing of your landing so that you're not flying through the air entirely blind.

, If you kept looking straight the split second after you left the lip, you should have some sense of the timing of the jump (how long you should be in the air before landing). Tip #2: Hold your rotation at 90 degrees for a split second. This will give you more control over your rotation so you can dictate when to put the landing gear down (versus having inertia dictate the rotation).

,,  For starters, it will help to land slightly on your toes to avoid either washing out or over-rotating.

, It helps to imagine putting your butt down.

Finish the golf swing over your left shoulder (for right-handed golfers) or right shoulder (for left-handed golfers).",How to Drive a Golf Ball," Today's equipment and golf balls are not necessarily tailored for older 7-8 degree drivers. Those are a thing of the past. Getting the ball up in the air on a good trajectory is the first step to driving the ball longer. Many touring pros regularly use 9 and 10 degree drivers and drive the ball 300 plus yards. However, today's average driver loft for amateurs is 11.5 degrees.A higher lofted driver will give you more carry which can help you stay more consistent in your shots.


The loft of your driver affects carry and roll. A higher lofted driver will carry your ball further, which is where you get the most distance off your drive, and is better in wet conditions. However, if you are looking for lower drives that get a lot of roll, say if you play on courses with long, straight fairways, you may want a lower loft for more distance off the bounce.;
, While you mostly use a driver off the tee, you have options of another other wood, or iron. You won’t always use a driver when driving a golf ball. Some holes will be set up so that you have to use a 3, 5, or even 7 wood, or one of your irons, say if you are on a par 3.









You can use your swing speed to help determine which club you need off a tee shot. Say you hit your 7 iron 150 yards, your swing speed is most likely around 95-104 mph. An 8 or 9 iron will be around 105-115 mph.Irons have a higher loft than woods and in the case of a par 3 hole, you’ll be aiming directly for the green, which means you want more carry and less roll. If the green is less than 200 yards (183 m) away, you’re going to want to use an iron.

, Picking the right golf ball for your game can be a bit of a headache. You have to factor spin, hardness, distance, and most importantly, feel. Unfortunately, there’s no “golden ball” that has all the answers for you.


The best way to determine the right ball for you is to go to your local golf shop and talk to a professional about what you want in your shot. Hit a few balls and rely on how they feel. Golf is one the most mental games out there and feeling comfortable in what you’re hitting can greatly affect your shot.
Additionally, you can have a few different types of balls in your bag for different shots.

, Nowadays everything in golf has multiple options to choose from, including the tee you use. With a lot of modern drivers having large heads, the need to make taller tees arose, resulting in tees of varying lengths.


If you’re on a long par 4 or par 5 and need to crush the ball to hit the green within par, a taller tee for your driver is usually the way to go. However, a taller tee isn’t always the best option when using an iron as you could tee the ball too high and cut under the ball.

, If done correctly, your arms should form a ""V"" shape with both arms fully extended.


If you have a tendency to bend your left arm early, that will hinder distance; keep your ""V"" as long as possible before it bends at the finish of your swing and you will find yourself getting much more distance.
For a lot of golfers, it’s easy to pick some sort of marker that’s inline with where you want the place the ball on the fairway. You’ll know roughly how far you're going to hit the ball, so pick a spot and then look for a tree or something past your target to aim for, as an object is easier to aim for than a spot on the ground.

, Getting a straight drive starts with teeing the ball properly.


On average, you want a tee that will give you the best chance at hitting the ball squarely in the sweet spot of your club. If you are using a driver a with a large head, a tall tee is usually a good option. A high tee will allow you to hit the ball on your upswing, which can give you more carry and distance, but this can also backfire on you as if you place it too high you could end up hitting low on the ball and popping it up.
When you tee up a ball you’re preventing grass from coming between your clubface and the ball, thus giving you more control. For an iron shot you don’t need a tall tee. When teeing up for an iron shot, you want to give your ball the best lie. Tee the ball up just off the ground.For a hybrid club shot, tee the ball up about half an inch off the ground.

, A lot of golfers think that the ball should be inline with your front toes, but this can cause you to have an out-to-in swing resulting in a slice. While positioning the ball in front of your stance will give you more loft, you want to put the ball inline with the heel of your front foot, or where the pocket or logo is on your shirt (if you’re a righty).








set your back foot about hip-width, or slightly wider apart from your front foot.

, You want your arms to be straight and form a “V” shape when you set up your stance. For a drive, think of your body as making a reverse “K”.Your front arm should form a straight line with the shaft of your club. Think of your arm and the shaft as the shaft on an arrow with the club head being the arrow head.

, This doesn’t just entail measuring your distance from the ball, though. With your arms in place for your swing you should stand about eight-inches from the butt of your grip at address.









This is a pretty standard stance but won’t work for everyone. Go to the range and use this stance as a starting point. Practice hitting the ball and make adjustments until you are satisfied, changing the width of your stance, ball position, and distance from the ball.

, Even though you may think that gripping harder and swinging harder produces better results, that is isn’t the case. A grip that’s too hard can hinder your ability to achieve consistent distance. Instructing legend, Phil Galvano first introduced the idea that you will find that the great players indicated that the grip pressure should resemble holding a bird without crushing it, but also not letting it go. The tighter you hold the club, the less it will release throughout the ball. Your hands should be free of tension.Try different grip strengths at the range and watch for the results. Notice when your club doesn’t connect well because you grip too loose, or you skull the ball because you’re gripping too tightly.
If you’re a righty, you want to grip the club with your left hand where your fingers meet the palm of your hand. If you’re a lefty, do the same with your right hand.
Curl your fingers around the club and then without moving the grip, roll your hand over so your thumb is on the on the top of the grip.
Do the same with your other hand (right hand if you’re a righty, and left if you’re a lefty). Position the club between your fingers and palm, and place your pinky on the knuckle between your index and middle fingers. You can also interlock them if you prefer.
Roll your thumb over the thumb on your other hand.

, You should have two swings, one for power and one for control.Not every hole is going to allow you to crush the ball as far as you can. Some holes may have a water hazard cutting through it or dogleg to the right or left, so you have to be able to control the distance of your shot as well.


For a power swing, you want to position your head and the shaft slightly back behind your ball with a slightly wider stance.
For a control shot, narrow your stance slightly, position the ball slightly further back in your stance, and choke down on the club a bit.

,


When you go for your backswing, you should shift your weight backward. This will give your swing more power.
A lot of times your instinct might be to have a fast backswing thinking that it will give you more power to crush the ball. This is a trap as swinging too fast will take you out of alignment.
Stay flat. Your driving wood should stay along the ground, or just kissing the grass-you don’t want to drive it into the ground-for at least the first 20 to 25 percent of your swing. If your club is lifting up, you will pop the ball up and not get that long, smooth drive that you see the pros hit regularly.
Take a steady backswing and pause at the top to reset before begin your downswing. This doesn’t mean stopping as that will throw off your momentum. Think of it as hovering slightly before going down.

, This enables you to build up speed so that the golf club is still accelerating when it reaches the ball.









Your downswing should be one single movement that utilizes your entire body at the same time. But don’t rush here as you’ll go off plane if you do.
One very important factor on your downswing is to keep your head down and in place. This all happens very quickly and you may be excited to see how far you’ve hit the ball. But moving your head will move your whole body and ruin your shot.
You may be tempted to try and help the ball up by raising your arms. But keep your swing consistent and trust that your club will do the work.

, Many amateurs tend to flip the hands forward in an effort to get the ball in the air, which defeats the purpose of having good equipment and a proper setup. The leading hand (left hand for most players, right hand for lefties) should be angled down towards the ball on the downswing.


Think of it like hitting the ball with the back of leading hand. If your hand is flipping down on the downswing, your contact will not be solid and you will see consistent misses with your wood. Keeping the angle starts the ball low and lets it climb on its own through your generated power.

, Again, don't be in a rush to look up and see where the ball went. If you did this correctly, the ball will travel where you want it to.

A week before the competition, check to see if your costume/s fit you, break in any new dance/baton shoes, check that your stockings have no holes or ladders in them and see if you need any more dance/twirling supplies like make-up, hair spray, bobby pins, baton tape etc.

,
The night before the competition, make sure your batons are intact i.e.,
Also the night before the competition, get plenty of rest.,
Wake up early so you can do your hair and make up, but just remember not to stress too much about this (unless you are first up to compete) as you could always do your hair and/or makeup at the venue.

Challenge yourself.",How to Calculate Your Golf Handicap," To calculate your Handicap Index, you’ll first need a minimum of five golf scores (and no more than 20).


Gather at least five scores 18-hole scores or ten 9-hole scores and use them to calculate your Adjusted Gross Score.
To determine your Adjusted Gross Score (AGS), total up the number of strokes taken during a round, then adjust for the maximum per-hole scores (determined by the USGA’s Equitable Stroke Control guidelines). Most golf courses make the information on maximum per-hole scores available to the general public. Check the course’s website or inquire at the clubhouse.
For example, if you took 8 strokes on a hole whose maximum-per hole score is 5, you would count 5 strokes (not 8) for that hole when adding up your total number of strokes for the game.;
, Once you have your AGS, use it to determine your handicap differential.


The equation for a Handicap Differential is the Course Rating minus your AGS, multiplied by 113, and divided by the Slope Rating, or (AGS - Course Rating) x 113 / Slope Rating.
The Course Rating is the numerical value given by the UGSA to each set of tees on a course. It approximates the number of strokes it should take a scratch golfer to complete the course. Most courses make this information available via the course website or at the clubhouse.
The Slope Rating shows the difficulty of a course for an average golfer and is calculated by comparing the Course Rating to the scores of bogey golfers. Most golf courses make the Slope Rating available to their guests; again, check their website or at the clubhouse.For example, say your AGS is 85, the Course Rating is 69.3, and the Slope Rating is 117. You would have the equation (AGS - Course Rating) x 113 / Slope Rating, or (85 - 69.3) x 113 / 117, which results in a Handicap Differential of 15.2.

, The formula for your Handicap Index is the sum of your differentials divided by the number of differentials, multiplied by 0.96, or (Sum of Differentials / Number of Differentials) x 0.96.


The figure of 0.96 in the equation represents the “bonus for excellence” that the UGSA has figured into the Handicap Index.
Determine the number of differentials to be used. If you’re using 5-6 scores, use the lowest differential; if you have scores from 7-8 rounds, use the lowest two differentials; if you have scores from 9-10 rounds, use the lowest three differentials; and so on). You can use up to 20 scores (for which you would use the 10 lowest differentials). For more detail on how many differentials to use, see the UGSA Handicap Differentials Chart.
For example, if you’re using 8 scores, you’ll be using the lowest two differentials. Let’s say your two lowest differentials are 10 and 11. To average them, add them together, and then divide the resulting number by 2. Then multiply the result by 0.96, and drop any digits beyond the tenths place. The equation would look like this: 10 + 21 = 21; 21 / 2 = 10.5; 20.5 x 0.96 = 10.08. Dropping the digit beyond the tenths place gives you a handicap index of 10.0 (remember not to round up).

, If you haven’t already done so, you’ll need to calculate your Handicap Index in order to determine your Course Handicap (see previous section).


Your Course Handicap takes into account your ability and the course’s difficulty in order to show you your handicap for that particular course, or, in other words, how many strokes--based on your Handicap Index--you can deduct from your final score for this particular course.

, Most golf courses make this information available to players at the club house.


Look for the course’s Slope Rating on the course website or ask an employee at the course’s clubhouse.

, Once you have your Handicap Index and the course’s Slope Rating, you can total up your Course Handicap using the formula: (Handicap Index) x (Slope Rating) / 113. Round to the nearest whole number.


You divide by 113 because it represents the Standard Slope Rating established by the UGSA.
Many courses offer conversion charts that allow you to skip the formula altogether when looking up your Course Handicap. The UGSA also offers a comprehensive listing of Course Handicap conversion charts specific to the course you’ll be playing on.
For example, if you have a handicap index of 10.0 and a slope rating of 117, you would use the following equation: (10.0 x 117) / 113, which results in a course handicap of 10.3.

, The more practice you have with your strokes, the better your performance on the links will be.


Make it a habit to frequent the range regularly and often.
Use your practice at the range to perfect your stroke, which will translate into better form when it counts.

, Having ill-fitting or over-used equipment can have a noticeably negative impact on your game.


Check that your equipment is still in good working order (no disintegrating grips, no worn-down grooves, etc.). If it isn’t, invest in replacements.
Get your equipment properly fitted to you. Having equipment properly sized to your body can make a significant difference to the quality of your game., Challenging yourself will help keep your skills sharp and diversified.


Play different courses. Don’t get stuck only playing at your home course--challenge yourself by playing on new and different courses that will help you practice a variety of skills.
Play in less-than-ideal conditions. If it’s windy, rainy, or otherwise less-than-ideal outside, don’t stay home--instead, challenge yourself by playing in the more difficult conditions. Doing so will help you develop a broader, more diverse range of skills that you can then use to your advantage when playing in comparatively easier conditions.

Learn baton terminology.,
Select a baton that is the correct size for your height and wingspan.,
Learn to hold a baton.",How to Twirl a Baton1," A baton has three parts: the ball, shaft, and tip. The ball is the bigger end of the baton. The shaft is the baton’s metal or plastic middle section. The tip is the baton’s smaller end.These three terms are frequently used to describe hand position and twirls.;
, When choosing a baton, it is very important that you select the correct size. Using a baton that is the wrong size, increases your risk of slip-ups and injuries.


Stand straight and extend one arm in front of yourself parallel to the floor.
Ask a friend to measure from the base of your neck to the tip of your middle finger.
Purchase a baton that is made for a person with your measurement.
If you are unusually small or tall, remove or add 1 to 2 inches to the measurement.
If you are in between sizes, purchase the next size up.
Batons come in 1 inch increments.

, Before you can twirl a baton, you must learn how to hold one. Stand straight with your dominant arm along your side. Wrap your four fingers around the center of the baton’s shaft—the ball should be in front of you. Place your thumb along the top of the shaft—it should point towards the ball. Raise your arm 45° with your palm facing up. The shaft should be parallel to the floor.Occasionally, a specific twirl may require that you hold the baton with your thumb facing the tip.

As you rotate the baton so that the ball points directly at you, bring the ball over your arm.
Complete the horizontal circle—point the ball to the left., Once you have mastered the pattern, speed up the twirl and adjust your hold on the baton.


Pinch the baton between your thumb and index finger.
Use your remaining fingers—your middle, ring, and pinky fingers—to turn the baton.
As you speed up the twirl, keep your wrist loose., As a baton twirler, you must be able to execute moves with your dominant and non-dominant hand. The left horizontal twirl follows the same pattern as the right horizontal twirl.Although it may feel more natural to rotate the baton in the opposite direction (front, right, back, left), you must execute the move with a counterclockwise rotation.

, Test your horizontal twirling skills by passing the horizontally twirling baton from hand to hand.


Place the baton in your right hand and begin to twirl it horizontally.
Carefully move your left hand towards the center of the shaft and encircle the baton with your left hand’s thumb and pointer finger.
As the left hand gains control of the baton, continue to execute the horizontal twirl. Make sure the baton continues to rotate in a counterclockwise direction.The baton should remain horizontal the entire time.

While you rotate the ball towards yourself, bring the ball over your forearm. Complete the horizontal circle by rotating the ball to the left.Complete 3 to 4 horizontal spins.

, Throughout the horizontal twirl, the turn of your wrist causes your palm to face up and down. When the ball points left your palm is down; when the ball points right, your palm is up. Just before the ball points to the right, open your hand to create a flat, steady surface. The baton will continue to spin in a counterclockwise circle on the top of your palm and fingers.


Keep your fingers flat and out of the way.
As the baton slows, subtly move your palm as though it were a teeter-totter.

, When the ball is just about to point to the right, close your hand around the baton. Secure the baton between your thumb and index finger. Complete another series of horizontal twirls.Try the Palm Spin with your left hand!

Know the rules.,
Get your supplies together.,
Get the players together.,
Find a place to play.,
Pick your target ""holes"".,
Commence play.,
Resolve what to do about stuck and lost balls.,
Perfect your shot.",How to Play Urban Golf," The rules for urban golf aren't set in stone and you can modify golf rules as you wish. The rules that do matter are The Golden Rules. These are:Show respect – Don't play where it harms other people or their property. If you're asked to move away by residents or police, do so without being bothered. Don't spoil urban golf for everyone who is playing it fairly.
Everybody sucks – This is a game where anyone can join in and have fun. It's not about competitiveness. If it becomes about competitiveness for you, you're playing the wrong golf.
Don't be a control freak – There is no leader, no one person in charge who insists how the game is to be played. All players have a say in the progress and outcome of the game and if you don't handle this so well, again, you're playing the wrong game.;
, You'll need a few basics, some of which will fit neatly tucked into a day pack, golf caddy, or can be easily carried:


Get a golf club. Any cheap ""Big-Mart"" club or a club out of a friend's bag will do. As long as it's fit for hitting the ball, it's worthy of playing urban golf.
Find a few balls. Racket balls or tennis balls are the most effective and traditional for urban golf. It's not recommended to use real golf balls because they're hard and can break things. If you are a better player, there are off-course golf balls that don't break windows or dent cars that are new to Urban Golf. Callaway makes a mediocre one, but the best is an almost golf ball. They fly true and out perform racket balls and tennis balls. It's a good idea to mark each ball for each player so that every player knows which balls belong to which player. Have a few extras, in case some end up down a drain pipe or somewhere else you can't retrieve them from. It's a good idea to have at least three balls per player.
Make or download a scorecard. To keep scores, either write down the scores as you go on a piece of paper, or use a prepared score sheet.Each player is responsible for keeping a tally of his or her scores; or, ask a player good with numbers to keep the tally. Honesty is essential, you're all friends, and this is not a competition.
Pack snacks and drinks. When you get the munchies, take a break and enjoy the snacks together.

, Keep the group small, 10 players or less. Large groups become hard to manage, slow down the progress of the game, and can attract negative attention if things get too rowdy or out of hand. Of course, this doesn't mean you can't have a few spectators carrying the clubs and snacks for you! As long as everyone's having fun, watching is fine too.

, This is where it can be interesting, as the places to play can vary from a series of alleys and streets in an industrial section of town, or on the green areas of a city park. Just be sure that the area is not too crowded when you want to play; the tradition is to try to avoid most residential areas unless your play won't annoy residents.


Industrial or business areas can be great on weekends when the workers aren't around and the place is deserted.

, You're going to need to know what you're aiming for and this should be decided by all players. The holes can be something as simple as just hitting the side of a garbage can, tree, rolling over a manhole, or rolling under a car. Any round ball will roll a long way on pavement or asphalt. It's going to take some getting used to.


Space the areas far apart so that there is ample hitting space and it's reasonably difficult to get a ""hole-in-one"". The size of a standard city block works well as an idea for measurement.
Choose any amount of holes that suits your needs; around 9 target holes makes for an even and fun pace.
You can also pick spots as you go, especially if you're keen to keep on the move rather than to remain in one area.
Make sure everyone in your group is in agreement as to what the holes and course consist of before play commences.

, While there are no hard and fast rules, there are some basic guidelines to put into action so that the play is enjoyable and action-packed. Here are some suggestions (and you're perfectly entitled to change any of them as long as you keep within The Golden Rules):Select the holes as suggested earlier. Aim for the target hole and hit the tennis ball toward it.
Take turns in hitting the ball toward the target hole. After the first tee-off, the player with the ball furthest away from the target hits next.
A successful hit for a large hole is where the ball hits the target or passes through, under or in it. The larger the hole, the more accuracy required. If it's easy to hit, don't allow for ""near enough"" hits; make sure they're exact! For example, hitting dumpsters, trucks, and storage sheds means actually hitting them, not rolling close by.
A successful hit for a small or narrow hole is where the ball passes within a 3 foot (0.9 m) radius or 1 club length of the small target hole. For example, fire hydrants, manholes, poles, and mailboxes are harder to hit.
Award points. Each normal stroke is one point and a ball has to travel a few feet to be called a stroke. Loss of the ball counts as a 3 point penalty.

, Stuck and lost balls have the ability to slow down play and make things tedious. The following suggestions will help keep the game flowing fast:


Limit the search time for lost balls. This will keep the game moving well.
If the ball ends up in a pothole, or somewhere else challenging, each player is allowed to move the ball one club length in any direction to make it easier to make the next hit. The idea behind this is not to hold up the game.
Replace a lost ball by a new ball in the place where the other ball went out of bounds. Finding the lost ball means that you can remove 1.5 points from your score.
If the ball lands anywhere that could cause damage, the ball must be moved at least 3 club lengths away, or more if needed to avoid harm.

, Remembering that the aim of the game is to have fun, not be competitive, and to revel in your inability, there is one thing you can do to help yourself keep the game moving. Basically, try to keep your ball low to the ground. High flying balls are more easily lost and have poorly controlled trajectories that could hit something you don't want hit, resulting in damage.

"
"
Keep it safe.,
Maintain a good pace.,
Be kind to the course.,
Wear proper golf attire.,
Shake hands and be congratulatory at the end of the game.",How to Have Good Golf Etiquette," Do not swing your club until you know that others in your group are at a safe distance. Likewise, keep your distance when others are swinging. When practicing your swing, never swing in the direction of another player. There may be pebbles or twigs or other matter in the grass that could fly up and injure a playing partner.


Do not hit the ball until you are certain that the group ahead of you is out of range. If your ball appears headed toward another player or another group, give them a warning by yelling out, ""Fore!"" (an internationally recognized alert).
Also, observe the safety suggestions posted in golf carts and drive carefully. Golf etiquette requires keeping your cart off the grass as much as possible.
Another important rule is to never throw clubs in anger. In addition to being rude and childish, it could also be dangerous to fellow players.;
, Keep the round moving by being prepared to hit your shot when it is your turn. You probably don't like waiting on other groups, so don't make other groups wait on you. The player who is furthest from the hole hits first in a group. However, in friendly matches (as opposed to tournament play), this rule can be ignored in favor of ""ready play"" - players hit as they are ready. All players should agree to ""ready play"" before it is put into effect.


Do not spend too much time looking for a lost ball, particularly if there is a group behind you ready to play. If you insist on taking the full five minutes allotted in the rulebook to look for lost balls, golf etiquette says wave up the group behind to allow them to play through.
Always try to keep pace with the group ahead of you. If space opens in front of you, allow a faster group to play through.
When two players in a cart hit to opposite sides of a hole, drive to the first ball and drop off that player with his club, then drive to the second ball. After both players hit, meet up farther down the hole.
When walking from your cart to your ball, take a couple of clubs with you. Taking only one club, then having to return to the cart to retrieve a different club, is a huge time-waster.
Always leave the putting green as soon as your group has finished putting.

, Observe cart rules. Some courses will post ""cart path only"" signs; others will ask you to observe the ""90-degree rule."" Do as you are told. Keep carts away from greens and hazards. The wheels on carts can damage these sensitive areas.


Always remember to repair your divots in the fairway, and ball marks on the green. Avoid taking divots on a practice swing. Be sure to always rake sand bunkers after hitting to erase your footprints and damage to the area where your ball was.

, Shirts should be collared, and men's should be tucked into their shorts or pants. Women's shirts do not need to be collared, but tops with plunging necklines, bare backs, or anything revealing should not be worn.


Shorts are acceptable but they should be rather upscale. No gym shorts or cut-offs. Shorts should be no shorter than just above your knees. Conservative skirts are acceptable for women, or skorts (a combination of shorts and skirt). Men should wear pants or shorts with belt loops, but no cuffs since they trap dirt. Men should wear a leather belt.
Wear proper golf shoes. Running shoes or sandals are not appropriate. Also be sure that you wear soft spiked golf shoes, since most golf courses do not allow metal spikes.
Hats are a good idea. They shield the sun from your face and may improve your vision.
If playing in cooler weather, a jacket or sweater is appropriate.

, Good sportsmanship is demonstrated by shaking hands with your opponents at the end of the game and congratulating both the winner and those showing great improvement. Any disagreements should end at this point and a drink or meal to talk over anything in a civilized way is a fine way to end the game.

Always end with a smile.",How to Nail a Horizontal One Turn," When doing the box, literally sweep tip of the baton in your underarm, very lightly. It might sound a little nasty, but this makes it easier to toss the baton and it looks better than a sloppy preparation and/ or toss.;
, Toss the baton straight up. Always follow the baton with your eyes.

, When spinning, spot your spin by looking up at the baton, that way you're more likely to catch the baton and you won't get dizzy.

, If you have your arms out, it increases wind resistance, which slows down your turn.

, Do so whether you dropped the baton or not. Judges would rather see you smiling with confidence and drop the baton than to see you nail it but look unenthusiastic.

,
Ride away and just wait for praise from all your buddies.

,
Remember to visualize the trick throughout the takeoff to the landing.

,
Don't be scared and try a new trick after you master this one.

",How to Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard," Before attempting this trick, you should be at least an intermediate level rider. If you are not comfortable riding fast and in varied conditions, both forward and switch stances, you should work on your riding skills first. Learn to walk before you learn to fly.;
, Before attempting any trick over any jump, you should ride through the park inspecting all the jumps. Choose a jump within your ability range that will allow you to complete the frontside with confidence. After riding through the park and choosing a jump that you would feel comfortable trying the trick on you should go through the mental process of the trick.

, During the mental process, you have to visualize every aspect of doing the trick, the ride up to the jump, the take off of the jump, what you are going to see in the air, and the landing. If you can mentally picture all of these aspects then all that's really left is trying it.

, First make sure that there are no other riders trying to do the same jump as you. Keep the board flat by staying off your edges. This helps you maintain the speed you will need to make it to the landing of the jump.

, At this point shift your weight to your toe side edge, which should send you into a small toeside carve. Don't let this slight toeside carve slow you down, it is intended to keep you balanced as you approach the lip of the jump.

, This is the most crucial point of the jump, if you catch your edge or don't have enough speed to clear the jump the landing is going to be a long painful fall. When you reach the lip, get good pop into your rotation by shifting your weight to the heel side edge before reaching the end of the jump. Your weight should be equal on both feet, and you should be compressing into the transition of the jump. Think of standing and jumping off the ground - before you leap, you crouch - this point of the snowboard trick is the crouch.

, When the nose of the board is at the end of the take off you will want to pop off the jump. Do this by lifting up your front leg first then following with the back leg. Do this quickly, just like an ollie on a skateboard, you lift both legs almost at the same time, but lead with the front leg.

, While popping you want to throw both your arms in the direction of your rotation(regular footed counterclockwise, goofy footed clockwise), putting you into a frontside spin. *CRUCIAL* look over your leading shoulder to look where you are going! If you keep looking down the hill instead of in the direction of your spin, your body will not rotate, and you are going to land sideways on the snow - a prelude to a lot of pain.

, As you pass the first 90 degrees of the rotation (facing completely forward) grab your snowboard. An easy first grab to do is a frontside, indy grab (back hand grabs board between both of you legs), your hands should already be in place to grab the board if you throw your arms in front of you to initiate the rotation. When you grab, it allows you to have better control and style. You should be able to do different grabs once the indy becomes easy.

, Hold the grab and keep following through with the rotation about another 180 degrees (facing the take off of the jump.) At this point let go of the grab and start to look for the landing.

,, Suck up your knees to absorb the impact of the landing.

Keep skating.",How to Skateboard (Beginners)," There are lots of styles and brands of boards available for all skill levels and interests. Visit a local skate shop to browse the selection and get advice from more experienced skaters in choosing a skateboard that's appropriate for your size and desires from your board:










Longboards are great for cruising and easy for beginners to maneuver. If you're interested in something that will be easy to hop right on and go, or something to get you from place to place, a longboard is definitely the way to go. They're not great for tricks, so if you're interested in popping ollies, it's not the best option.

Skateboards are what you think when you think ""skateboard."" With tapered ends perfect for kicking tricks and jumps, and an easy soft maneuverability, these boards are excellent for skating around at quick speeds, though they'll take a little more practice to get balanced when you're first starting out. If you want to eventually drop into a half-pipe, though, this is the board for you.

Custom boards are built and assembled yourself with basic tools. Generally, more experienced skaters will choose their wheels, trucks, bearings, and deck separately  from the options available. This is good to choose the best brand of each component, whereas a pre-built board may have one or two bad components in specific.;
, You don't want a super-curved board and loose trucks when you're first starting out. While those kinds of features might be great for doing tricks, they're much more difficult to stay balanced while riding upon, making it unlikely that you'll stick to it, if you can't learn to stay on the board. You want a relatively flat board with tight trucks to learn on. You can loosen the trucks later, when you can control speed wobble.








, Trying to hop on your board with combat boots or flip-flops is a good way to hurt yourself or twist an ankle. Skate shoes have the right kind of sole to grip the board and ensure both protection and support, making them ideal for learning to skate. Vans, Airwalk, DC's, and Etnies are all signature skate shoes, though plenty of athletic companies now make shoes perfect for skating.









If you're not able to find a particular skating brand, what you want is a flat sole. Avoid the kind of textured tread common for tennis or running shoes, and instead go for something more like a deck shoe, with an even and flat surface on the bottom.

, It's absolutely essential that you get a skating helmet, which features a smooth surface and a snug chin strap to protect your head. It's likely you'll fall a lot, so it's very important that you ensure your safety and wear a helmet. Some even look pretty cool!









Additionally, knee pads, wrist guards, and elbow pads are also common protective gear to wear, especially when you're first getting started. When you get more comfortable on the board, you'll probably not need to wear all the pads every time you want to skate, but anytime you're learning a new trick, and especially when you're first learning to stay on the board, extra pads are a very good idea.
There's nothing dorky about avoiding expensive trips to the emergency room, especially when you're first starting out. Don't let anyone tell you that ""real skaters"" don't use protective gear, which is an immature, foolish, and flat-out wrong. Besides, a helmet is cooler than permanent brain damage.

, Ideally, you'll want smooth concrete, without many bumps and cracks that'll jostle you as you're trying to learn to move. Eventually, you'll be able to skate over uneven surfaces safely, but it's easiest to learn in a parking lot or driveway that's mostly flat and even.









It's unfortunately harder and harder to find places that welcome skateboarders, given the unfair reputation skateboarding has in some towns. Don't be a skater that gives law-abiding boarders a bad name: make sure you've got permission to skate when you're skating, and avoid scuffing up property that doesn't belong to you.

, The biggest thing that keeps beginners from actually learning how to skate is wanting to jump straight to performing ollies before learning the fundamentals. You'll get there, with practice, but like you've got to learn to play a simple guitar chord before you learn to melt faces with tapping solos, you've got to learn to push the board and ride it comfortably. You've got to learn to stay on the board before you start jumping with it.







, There's no right way to stand on the board, so set the board on stable ground, like the grass or even carpet, where it won't roll easily, and figure out what feels most comfortable for you. Put one foot in front of the other, lined up roughly with the truck screws.










Regular foot means you've got your left foot forward your right foot. Generally, this means you'll push with your right foot and ride with your left.

Goofy foot means you've got your right foot forward, meaning you'll push with your left. Despite the name, there's nothing ""unusual"" about this stance. It's just as common as regular footedness.

Mongo foot is more unusual, and refers to a riding stance in which the forward foot is the foot used to push. It may feel natural for you at first, but don't make it a habit. Riding mongo creates an awkward motion of swinging your foot forward which can limit your capabilities with tricks. You also run a much higher risk of the board slipping out forward from under you.

, On some level concrete, stand on the board with your forward foot and use a long, even step with your back foot to create momentum.









When beginners start, they often tend to take several short ""stabs"" before getting started, rather than long pushes. You want to use a longer sweeping push off, which will make the ride smoother and ensure that you'll stay balanced.

, When you get moving, you need to shift your riding foot sideways, more like how you were standing when you had the board still on the grass, and bring your pushing foot up to rest lightly on the fishtail at the back of the board. Your knees should be slightly bent, but you should be generally standing upright, with a straight back, to learn to balance correctly.








In a proper riding stance, your forward foot should be just behind or on the front truck screws, and your back foot should be near the back of your board, near or on the tail. This is the most stable and safe riding stance, and having your back foot already on the tail makes a quick kickturn easier.
This is the most difficult thing to learn when you're first getting started, but the good news is you'll be riding successfully when you get it figured out! No fear!

, To turn, you'll shift your weight forward or back from the ankle, depending on your stance and whether or not you want to go right or left. The amount of pressure you'll use will depend on how tight your trucks are and how far you want to turn. Practice on level surface, getting started, shifting into your riding stance, and then executing a turn safely without falling off. This type of turning is the most common and is referred to as carving.









To quickly avoid something or make a tight turn that carving can't reach, kickturning is a very valuable skill. With your back foot, apply a slight pressure to the tail (to lift the front wheels slightly off the ground) and pivot your body in the direction you want to turn. This should be done in one motion. Be careful to not to put too much pressure on the tail or you risk the board slipping out from under you. Also, it's probably not a very good idea to do this while speeding downhill.

, There are lots of different ways to stop a skateboard, and many of them are more advanced. For the beginner, the easiest way is usually to either gradually slow down, and stop by putting a foot to the pavement, or to execute a tail stop.









To tail stop, you'll shift most of your weight onto your back foot, standing on the tail of the board, and grind the board to a stop with the tail. Some people don't like doing this because it wears down the back tail, but many skateboards, especially flat cruising models, have a plastic stopper designed for helping you stop, making it a good option for beginners.

, No skater has ever not fallen off the board. It can be discouraging, but learning to fall properly can help make sure you don't seriously hurt yourself. Always wear a helmet, to keep your head safe, and try to use wrist guards, which you can use to take the brunt of most falls and avoid the nasty scrapes that are part of the skating world.









The most common problem is usually running over small pebbles that jam up the wheels, or hitting a crack that suddenly causes you to lose your balance. Keep a close eye on the terrain as you're skating, but keep your eyes up to stay balanced as much as possible.

, Like music and other sports, skating is easiest to learn when you have good people to learn from. Hook up with more experienced skaters to watch and learn all you can, picking up tips and tricks along the way. Ask for advice and be honest about your experience.









Make sure you don't get suckered into trying something you're not ready for. If you go out skating with a bunch of dudes ollieing down a flight of stairs, you could wind up seriously hurting yourself if you're just trying to learn how to stop without falling down. Go slowly. You'll get there eventually.

, Skating videos are at the heart of skating culture. Compilation videos and tutorials are widely available for free on the Internet. You can find virtuosic displays of skating prowess, as well as helpful hints and tips for the beginner. For example, Aaron Kyro and Andy Schrock have good tutorials and information on their channels. Learn how to do more advanced technical things and tricks with videos., Letting gravity help you along the way is an important step in beaming a more advanced skater. It can be scary the first time you start going downhill and don't have to push, so learning to work with it and stay in control of your board is a good thing to learn early on.









To stay balanced, crouch lower on the board and use your arms to stay from swaying side to side. Keep your ankles as still as possible, because at higher speeds smaller movements create bigger swings, making it more likely you'll lose your balance.

, When you start getting comfortable on the board and can stay on it regularly without falling down, you might be ready to start trying a trick or two. It's what you've been building toward after all! The best and easiest tricks for beginners are:









Shove-it (not a pop shove-it because you don't pop into the air)
Ollie
Grinding
Kick-flip

, Stick with it! Learning to skateboard well takes time and effort. It's not something you'll be able to learn overnight, but by taking it slowly and practicing as much as you can, you'll improve and get more comfortable on the board. Try not to get discouraged.

Classic skateboards have curved noses and tails, and have a concave to help with tricks. They come in a variety of sizes, most about 31"" or 30 in length long and 8"" wide. These are the boards to buy if you want to skate at the skatepark or on the street and to do tricks, eventually.

Longboards or cruisers have a longer and flatter body. The length of the board varies, but they can be up to twice as long as a classic skateboard, making them much more stable and rideable for beginners. You can't really do tricks, but if you're interested in skating as a way of getting around or bombing hills, it's a great option.
A beginner skateboard should cost between $50-$150. Try to have your board set up for you at the skate-shop with the right kinds of trucks and wheels for what you'll be doing. Just remember, NEVER buy a Walmart or Toys R Us board. They will snap quickly and are hard to learn on. Go to a real skate shop.;
, Skate shoes are typically sold by brands such as Vans, Airwalk, Converse, or Etnies. They have sturdy sides and flat bottoms, perfect for gripping the board. While you can always skate with regular sneakers, it's a lot easier to maneuver around the board with skate shoes.


Never try to skate in sandals or flip-flops. You need to be able to move your feet around easily and feel comfortable. Without these, you can hurt your ankle easily and are a lot more likely to fall.

, When you're first starting out learning to skate, you're going to fall down. Probably a lot. Consider investing in safety equipment such as a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads to protect you from falls and accidents. This is especially important for beginners. Some states, like California, require all skaters to wear helmets on the street.Make sure to get a helmet that fits your head properly. Before you go to the store, use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your head, just above your eye brows, in a straight line around your skull. Buy a helmet that fits snugly.
There's nothing lame/childish about pads. It's important to protect yourself from serious head injuries.

, A level, concrete driveway or parking lot is a good place to start getting comfortable on the board. Make sure there isn't anything in your way and be wary of cracks, loose stones and potholes. Running over a little pebble can account for a whole lot of crashes, especially with hard wheels.


Skateparks are great places to skate once you've got some experience. If you're just trying to get the board to stay under you without falling down, parks might be a little intense. If there's one in your area, go watch some skaters for tips, but stay on the sidelines.

, Your dad probably can't shove it or anything, so ask someone from a local shop or park if you can watch them. Bring some beginners and ask if what he's doing is intermediate to advanced skating, if it is, perfect. You have a teacher.


Skating with friends is a big part of what skating is all about. If you've got some skater friends, get help learning from them. Learning from friends is infinitely better than learning on your own or on the internet.

, Put the board flat on the ground and stand on it to learn to place your feet properly, and get your balance without falling down. Stand with your feet angled sideways on the board, your feet lined up roughly with the truck screws that attach the wheels to the board.


Regular foot means that you've got your left foot forward and your right foot in the rear. This usually means that you'll use your right foot to push.
Goofy foot means that you've got your right foot forward and left in the rear. Usually, this means you'll use your left foot to push.
Rock back and forth a little to see how the wheels move and how much sway you've got on the trucks. Just get comfortable.

, Turn your front foot slightly so it's more straight with the board, instead of sideways on the board. Use your other foot to gently push off, going very slowly at first. You don't want to have an accident just because you were going too fast before you were ready.


After you get some momentum, practice putting your back foot into place on the back of the board, just ahead of the tail curl, around the trucks. Get your balance and ride, bending your knees some to keep your balance.
Mongo foot means that you feel more comfortable pushing off with your lead foot, and riding with your back foot. Some people see it as acceptable, but it will hinder you later and it's an awkward motion to swing your front foot around. If you find yourself pushing mongo, try switching from regular to goofy or vice-versa.

, Keep practicing, making little push-offs, and pivoting your feet to ride on the board until you slow down. Then pivot your riding foot straight, push off with your other foot, and pivot back. The more you do this, the more comfortable you'll become at riding the board.


Try speeding up, but just a little. Like a bike, some riders find it actually quite a bit easier to keep your balance when you're moving a little quicker.
If you start speed-wobbling, you can tighten your trucks. This will make it harder to turn but you can practice with tight trucks until you get your speed wobble under control. Shifting your weight forward usually helps.

, Once you've got the hang of pushing off and riding some, try turning the board gently by shifting your weight. Ride with your knees flexed, keeping your center of gravity low to the ground. Then, shift your weight forward some to turn right (if you're riding regular foot), and rotate your ankles back to turn the board left.


Depending on how loose your trucks are, you may have to only shift your weight very gently, or really bend into it. You can loosen your trucks by turning the large bolt in the center of each truck (lefty loosy, righty tighty). This puts more (tight) or less (loose) pressure on the bushings and makes turning easier (loose) or harder (tight).
If you have trouble balancing or falling while turning, shift your upper-body weight in the opposite direction. What really matters is that your feet pivot the deck so the trucks do the turning.

, To stop, you can simply put your pushing foot down when you've slowed down some, and halt your momentum. However, don't just jam your foot down hard at a fast speed. Start by dragging lightly and drag harder when you're going slow. Keep your riding foot on the board, or it'll just keep going.


You can also shift your weight back and scrape the tail against the ground if you want to stop. Some longboards have built-in plastic ""brake"" pads along the back lip of the board, while others won't. This is usually a bit more difficult, and will scrape away at the back of the board. An alternative that won't damage your board is to put your heel behind with your toes still on the tail when you do this. Your heel will drag on the ground instead of the tail.

, Once you get very comfortable just riding your board, try switching around and riding with your back foot in front and your front foot in back. If you want to be a really good skater, you'll learn to skate equally comfortably from both directions, if you get switched around for a trick. This comes in handy when you try a half-pipe, or any number of different types of skateboarding tricks.

, All skaters fall early and often. It's a part of skateboarding. It's important to wear the proper safety gear at all times, and learn to fall properly. To keep yourself from getting injured more seriously than the regular scrapes and bruises that are the skaters calling card, you can learn a few little tricks to keep yourself safe.


Put your arms out, but keep them loose. If you're very rigid, you risk breaking wrists and ankles more seriously than if you use them to cushion your fall.Roll out any time that you fall. You might scrape yourself up, but it'll hurt a lot less than if you're landing with a splat.
Bail out if you see something going bad. If you're going too fast and can't control your board, just jump off and land on your feet, or roll into the grass. Don't stick on a board that you've lost control of.

, Find some other skaters to skate with. It helps you to learn from their styles or different skill levels. If you don't know anyone, just talk to some other skaters at the local skate park. They are usually friendly, and will help you out. Experiment, make a higher ollie, read about how to do another trick, whatever your heart desires. Your teacher is more a friend than an instructor now, share skills with him, and anyone else you want to show off to.


For tips on how to do the moves, you can always watch a move in a video in slow motion and pay attention to the foot movement. Sequential photos are another great way to learn.
The more you practice, the better you will be. Don't get discouraged because you can't land a trick the first or second try. Just practice and have fun, and you will get the trick eventually.

, An ollie involves popping the board up into the air and landing on it safely. The first part of this trick is to get comfortable shifting your back foot for the tail of the board to hit the ground, so you can pop it up and into the air. Get used to this motion, it can't be stressed enough.


As you stand on the board, practice rocking back, popping the nose up into the air and staying balanced. You can even try it in motion if you work up the nerve.
Before you even try the first motion of an ollie, it might be a good idea to just stand beside the skateboard and practice popping it up into the air. Use your foot to stomp on the tail and see how much pressure it takes to pop it up in the air. This is also useful to pop it up to your hands and pick it up easily.

, Stand on the board and flex your knees quite low, shifting your center of gravity down over the trucks. Shift your back foot back so it's on the tail. Pop the tail back, as you would while you're doing a manual, except all the way to the ground. Then pop it up into the ollie.


Don't start in motion just yet. Before you can nail an ollie on the ground, it's quite dangerous to try one while you're skating. You'll probably wipe out.

, To get the board to pop, you want to simultaneously slide your front foot backward just a little and leap into the air, bringing your knees up to your chest, while you stab down on the tail with your back foot.


This needs to be done in one swift motion, and it's somewhat difficult to get the hang of at first. You want to jump up into the air and off the board at the same time as you pop down with your back foot.You'll leap with your front foot just a little before you leap with your back foot. Imagine you're running sideways and trying to jump over a cone. You want to do that kind of motion.

, After the board pops up in the air, drag your front foot forward to flatten the board back out and keep it under control. You'll need to start doing this pretty much as soon as you jump into the air.

, After you've straightened the board, push it back to the ground by straightening your legs and landing on the board in riding position. The most important thing to remember is to land with your feet over the bolts and knees bent, this improves your chances of rolling away successfully and keeps the board from breaking as often, as well as avoiding injury.


No shame in bailing out. If the board hasn't stayed straight, or it just doesn't feel right, don't try to land on it. Land on your feet instead.
In fact, it's probably a good idea to practice your first ollie by just jumping off the board and landing beside it.

, Once you can land ten stationary ollies in a row, try doing one in motion. Push off and start skating at a low to moderate speed, then crouch down and pop the board up just as you would when you're standing still.


This is the fundamental skill to learn, which most other popping style tricks are based on. For more information and links to specific trick articles, check out the next section.

, Do an ollie as high as you can, then as you level off your feet, give a nudge with the front foot on the board so it spins 180 degrees. You may want to use a little ""scoop"" motion with the back foot to make it spin easier.

, Do the same thing as a pop shove it, except when you nudge the board, kick the little area where the side of the board rises. Try out a few different motions until you get it to spin. This is not an easy trick, so practice and don't give up.

, Start with a fairly low rail (equal to or less than one foot.) This is not easy, so take it in steps.


Start out simply rolling up to the rail, then jump off of your board and land with just your feet on the rail, letting the board roll away.
Next, practice popping the board up as you jump, but don't worry about where it goes after that. Just make sure that your feet land on the rail.
Make sure you roll up to the rail at a slight angle, not completely straight. This way, there's less risk of one truck getting caught on the start of the rail.
Now it's time for the real thing. Ollie as high as you can, in the direction of the rail. Land with your feet on the bolts and the board balanced on the rail.
If the deck is sliding sideways on the rail, it's a board-slide. If you stay in the direction of the rail so your trucks lock in and grind it, it's a 50-50 grind.
Once you get to the end of the rail, turn the board around if you're in a board-slide (so it faces the right direction) and land over the bolts. If you're doing a 50-50 grind, lift the front wheels slightly (by pushing on the tail, again slightly) to the front of the board doesn't plummet down. An alternative is to ollie off.

, Dropping in takes guts, but it's worth it.


Start with your tail on the coping (the metal on the top of the half-pipe) and your foot just behind the bolts, but far enough back to balance.
Put your front foot over the bolts, and slam the board down. Don't hesitate, or you will fall. It takes confidence and power.
Be sure to lean forward in this motion. If you don't, the board will slide out from under you. Your shoulders should always be parallel to the board.
Don't worry about coming down on the other side, just hop off of your board at the top.

, Some good ones are a Rock to Fakie, Axle Stall, and Nose Stall. These look impressive, but are not that difficult to learn if you have several months of experience. When you go to the skatepark always be aware so you don't get hit. Trust me it hurts.

Determine your preferred stance.It is important to find and use your preferred stance to balance on a skateboard.,
Place your feet just behind the bolts.,
Stand on your skateboard on carpet or grass.,
Work on your balance by shifting your weight.",How to Balance Yourself on a Skateboard1," The two main positions that skateboarders use are called regular and goofy. Try out both positions to see what feels the most natural to you.


If your left foot is forward, or you are facing to the right you are in the position called ""regular"". If your right foot is forward, or you are facing to the left you are in the position called ""goofy"".;
, Make sure that when you stand on the skateboard, your feet are positioned just behind the bolts.This is the best way to position your feet for good balance. Placing your feet in the middle of the board will not give you as much control and it also makes it easier to break your board.


The bolts are what is securing your skateboard’s wheels to the board, so your feet should be just behind the wheels on your board.

, Before you try to balance while riding your skateboard, start by balancing on your skateboard while it is standing still. The easiest way to keep your skateboard from moving around too much is to place it on some carpet or grass. Then, stand on your skateboard and work on your balance.You can also try placing an object in front of and behind the wheels on your skateboard to keep it from moving around too much. Try placing a block of wood on either side of your skateboard, or position the board between two cinder blocks.
If you still find it difficult to stand on the board even when it is not moving, then you might try holding onto a railing or a wall to steady yourself and work up to standing on the board without holding onto anything.

, You do not need to lean back and forth or move much at all to work on your balance. Just try to keep your body weight centered and shift your weight slightly from your heels to your toes to stay stable on the board.








Keeping a slight bend in your knees is also a good idea. This will help to keep your center of gravity lower to the ground, which will make it easier to balance.
To improve your balance, you will need to practice balancing on the board often. Try to practice for at least 15 minutes every day.

Practice pushing off on a level surface.,
Place the other foot on the board.,
Stay on the board until it stops.,
Use your heels and toes to turn the board.",How to Balance Yourself on a Skateboard2," When you feel ready to try balancing on a moving skateboard, start with something easy such as a level stretch of concrete. Position your front foot on the board and place the other foot on the ground just in front of that foot. Then, use your foot to push on the concrete and move your board and body forward.








Keep a low center of gravity as you push. Bend your knees and balance your body weight over the foot that is on the skateboard.
Find a flat sidewalk or visit your local skate park to find a flat surface that is away from traffic.
If you do decide to try skating on a surface with an incline, make sure that the incline is low to avoid losing control of the board.

, After you push off, you will need to bring your pushing foot up and onto the board.Remember to place this foot behind the bolts on your board and keep it turned sideways. This will make it easier to balance on the board because you will be able to rock back and forth on your foot in a more stable way.









Keep your front foot planted as you bring the back foot onto the board if you push ""regular""
Keep your back foot planted as you bring the front foot onto the board if you push ""mongo""

, After you get positioned on the moving board, ride it and do your best to stay balanced until it comes to a stop on its own.If you are on a flat surface, then this should not take very long.









If you have decided to try riding your board down a hill, then this may take a little longer and you may even need to stop yourself if you start to feel unstable. To stop the board, use your back foot to step on the tail of the board. This will cause the tail to grind against the ground and come to a stop., You can experiment with turning the board while you are practicing riding it. To turn the board, simply shift your weight slightly from one side of the board to the other.








For example, if you shift your weight to your heels, then the board will shift to the right or left depending on which direction your heels are facing. If you shift your weight to your toes, then your board will turn in that direction.

Wear skate shoes.,
Consider getting a custom made skateboard.,
Wear a helmet and protective padding.",How to Balance Yourself on a Skateboard3," You can skateboard in sneakers, but skate shoes are specially designed to help you stay on the board. Skate shoes are wider than regular sneakers, so they make more contact with the board. The width of skate shoes may also make it easier for you to keep your balance on the board.You can find skate shoes in most sporting good stores and department stores.

, Skateboards are widely available, but you may want to consider getting a custom made skateboard, or at least purchasing one from a skateboard shop. This will allow you to ask questions and get help from people who are knowledgeable about skateboarding and skateboards. You can get advice on the best type of skateboard for your abilities and needs.For example, you may prefer a skateboard that can be used on dirt rails for mountain boarding, or you may just want one that can be used in a skate park and on sidewalks.
By getting a skateboard that is customized for your needs, you may have an easier time of balancing on your skateboard.

, Skateboarding can be a dangerous sport, so it is important to protect yourself by wearing the proper gear.Always wear a helmet, wrist guards, and elbow pads when you are skateboarding. Wearing these special items will help to protect you when you fall, which happens often when you are first learning how to skateboard.Make sure that you wear a helmet that meets the ASTM F1492 standard for skateboard helmets. Check the tag on the helmet to be sure.
While wearing protective gear will not help you to balance on the board, it may help you to feel more confident because you will be less likely to get a serious head injury or a broken wrist.

Build your leg muscles.,
Strengthen your calves.,
Build your core muscles.,
Build your arm muscles.,
Find workouts that help and motivate you.,
Find inspiration through partners, trainers, and music.",How to Jump Higher for Volleyball1," Your legs are the powerhouse of your jump. The stronger your leg muscles are, the harder you can propel yourself upwards to a maximum vertical leap. The type of exercises you can do will depend on the equipment you have available to you. Consult a health or fitness specialist to ensure your body is able to strengthen itself in a healthy manner.


Focus on exercises that mimic the jumping motion. A good way to do this is by doing squats, which can be done with or without equipment. Squats can be done by simply standing with your legs shoulder width apart and lowering your body towards the ground with your back straight and knees bent at a 45 degree angle as if you were sitting down on a chair. Stand up straight and repeat. Increase the intensity by adding weights, being careful to incrementally increase weights as your strength increases.Lunges strengthen your glutes and can be done with or without equipment. Lunges can be done by simply standing up straight and taking one step forward with your back straight and knee bent at a 45 degree angle. Step out farther for a more difficult lunge. Stand up straight and repeat, making sure to alternate legs. Increase the intensity by adding weights, being careful to incrementally increase weights as your strength increases.Before using any equipment, consult a specialist to ensure its proper use.;
, This muscle group is essential to jumping higher. Calf raises are an easy and effective exercise that can be done with or without equipment.


Calf raises can be done by standing up straight with your feet on the ground and then moving up onto your tippy toes. Stand at a ledge to increase the range of motion to your muscles. You can also do one leg at a time making sure to alternate between each leg to ensure balance. Increase the intensity by adding weights, being careful to incrementally increase weights as your strength increases., Contrary to popular belief, jumping isn't just about the muscles in your legs. Your core muscles in your back and abdominals are a big part in your body movement and are engaged for balance and coordination.Many core workouts can be done without equipment. Some good workouts to build these muscles are crunches and supermans.
There are many variations of abdominal exercises, one of the simplest is the crunch. Lay down with your back and feet on the ground with your knees bent. Keeping your feet and glutes on the ground, crunch your abdominal muscles as you move your upper body toward your knees. You can keep your hands behind you or out in front of you. Lower yourself back down to the starting position and repeat. Be careful to move with purpose, isolating your abdominal muscles and being careful to avoid any jerking movements that could be harmful to your lower back.Supermans are a great compliment to crunches as they strengthen your lower back. Lay face down with your hands above your head to mimic a flying “Superman”. Raise both your upper body and legs simultaneously and hold for a beat to isolate the muscles of your lower back. Lower back down to the starting position and repeat as necessary., Arm muscles are also a big part in jumping higher as they provide momentum as you explode upwards. Arms are also a big part of your approach (when you go up to hit a ball or block).


Many good workouts for your arms can be done with weights or equipment. Push ups and pull ups can be done with minimal equipment while bicep curls and tricep pushdowns need weights or equipment for resistance.
Push-ups can be done without any equipment by laying down face down with the palms of your hands on the ground and your arms extended, perpendicular to your body, but bent at the elbows. Push down onto the palm of your hands, lifting your body off the ground and straightening your arms. Lower yourself back down to the starting position and repeat. Change the positioning of your hands to target different muscles.Pullups need to be done with a bar high enough to lift yourself off of the ground. Simply grab the bar above your head and lift yourself towards the bar. It may be difficult at first but try to keep your body straight and allow yourself to rise and fall at the full range of motion of your arms. You can either keep your palms facing away from you or towards you, varying the distance between them. Changing the positioning of your hands will target different muscles.
Try not to let your arms fall straight down and lock. It is better to keep some bend in them between pullups. Bicep curls can be done with weights or equipment by simply keeping your arm straight at your side and lifting the weight toward your bicep, bending at the elbow. Alternate between arms. Changing your grip targets different areas of your bicep and forearm muscles.Tricep pushdowns are done with specialized equipment, usually with cables used to move weights. Usually ropes, bars, or handles are attached to the end of the cable. Utilizing different attachments focuses on different areas of your triceps. Stand straight with your feet shoulder width apart and pull the cable down by the attachment starting with your elbows at 90 degrees and extending downward, moving your hands towards the ground. Consult a fitness specialist for the proper use of each attachment., Lifting weights and exercising as a whole can be repetitive and boring. Find exercises that help workout your muscles or get you jumping without losing motivation. There are many free resources online to help you vary your workout and find exercises that work for you., Jam out to some of your favorite tunes to keep your mind distracted from the repetition. High energy music can also keep your energy up. Find a trainer, training partner or a workout video for support.


Trainers can be expensive but worth the investment to ensure your safety and maximize your potential.
Choose your training partners wisely as you want to support each other. It’s easy to create a social atmosphere and get distracted from the task at hand when you workout with friends who don’t have the same goals as you.

Avoid the ugly cousin of complaining, as well: the humblebrag. Don't use complaints as a way of secretly working in details that make you sound good. Instead of saying, ""'I'm super-stressed that they really just made a mistake and I didn't actually get into Harvard"" just be genuine. Say, ""I'm feeling really fortunate. It's pretty unbelievable to get into a school like Harvard."";
, Remember how excited you were for that toy you got when you were five years old? How excited are you about it now? Lame people treat everything as if it were that toy. Try to pull back some and look at the bigger picture, so you don't sound out of touch with others.


It's fine to get excited about things, and it's normal to get down in the dumps about other things. The difference in people who say lame things is that they're over-emphasizing the excitement or the negativity. Try to keep things in perspective.
Lame statement: ""I'm literally going to die if I don't get to go to the prom with someone this year. I feel like my life is going to end on prom night if I'm not there."" Normal statement: ""I hope I get to go to prom. It'd be fun to go.""

, There's nothing more lame than flaky behavior. If you tell your friend that you're down for a lunch date, then cancel at the last minute, that's lame. If you promise your brother you'll hang out with him on Friday night and then ignore his texts and go on a date instead, that's lame. If you want to avoid being lame, make your words mean something by backing them up with action.


Some people have a hard time saying no, and over-commit to people. If you already have plans with a friend and get asked on a date, it's not going to be the end of the world to find another time for dating. Be honest and have the bravery to tell the truth.

, What we call ""lame"" is often the result of low self-esteem. People who need constant reassurance from others, or need to be complimented on a regular basis to keep their self-esteem levels up can come off as being somewhat lame to more confident people. Even if you're not confident, stop looking to others for reassurance and look to yourself.


You don't have to the be the most confident person in the room to avoid being a needy friend. Nobody feels confident and assured all the time, but it's lame to constantly ask other people to reassure you that you're ok.
For more on cultivating your own confidence, read the next section.

, It's easy to tell the truth when things are going right for you, but what about when you're in the wrong? What about when you messed something up at work, and the boss is looking for someone to blame? What about when your parents are looking for an answer to how the car got scratched? Lying to escape trouble is lame.


Sometimes teenagers develop a tendency to stretch the truth or embellish stories as a way of making themselves sound better. Instead of making up what you did last weekend, decide to make your next weekend exciting, so you'll have something better to say next time.

, If you're a stick in the mud, it'll be hard for others to think of you as being anything other than a lame-o. Lame people always come up with excuses to avoid doing things, rather than coming up with reasons to act, reasons to have fun, and reasons to take a risk. Instead of coming up with reasons you can't do something, come up with reasons that you can.


Being more agreeable doesn't mean being reckless. It's lame to compromise your core values and become someone you aren't to impress others. Don't experiment with alcohol or drugs just because other kids at your school are, or get pushed into doing something you don't want to do. That's lame.

, Learn to listen to others and to respect other people for who they are. Try being genuinely interested in what other people have going on in their lives. Ask them questions and pay attention to the answers. When you're listening, don't just wait for your turn to speak. Really listen to other people and learn everything that you can from them.


Lame people are often self-obsessed and ego-centric. If you want to avoid this kind of behavior, learn to empathize.

, When you mess up, you can make a million excuses for why what you did was wrong, why you failed, or what you didn't have that would have helped you succeed. But that's lame. Even if the world is against you, even when the cards are stacked to favor others, you need to take responsibility for yourself and own up to your actions, and do the best that you can.


Don't make excuses after you do things, and definitely don't come up with excuses beforehand. If you end up thinking that you're going to fail a test because you're not good enough at math, you're probably going to fail before you even start. It's lame to not even try.

, You can display confidence, even if you're feeling lame and not especially confident, simply in the way that you speak. Use a room-appropriate volume, and speak loud enough so that everyone will be able to hear what you have to say. Speak as clearly and as succinctly as possible.


Don't couch what you say in negating language. Never start a sentence with, ""I mean, I don't really know what I'm saying, but..."" or ""This is dumb, but..."" or ""Sorry, but...""Speaking confidently has two effects. It makes you feel good, even if you're faking it, by taking a stand for yourself and making your voice heard. Other people will respect someone who speaks up for themselves, as well, meaning that they'll be more respectful of you in the future, which will make you more confidence in turn. Win-win.

, Everyone's been in a meeting, a classroom, or a group conversation with someone who doesn't know when to button up, and feels the need to contribute constantly, every time there's an opening. It's lame to talk if you don't have anything to say. Learn to pipe down if you have nothing to contribute to a conversation and choose to listen instead.It's also important to recognize when it's time for you to contribute. Conversation needs to be a two-way street, and anyone who doesn't recognize the need to speak and the need to listen is being kind of lame.

, Aside from being an unhealthy way to spend your time, constantly putting yourself up against others will only have the effect of pushing your ship into lamer waters. If you don't have an inner sense of self and your own confident mindset, but choose to compare your accomplishments and skills to other people, you'll do everything you do for the wrong reasons. And that's lame.


""They have more advantages than I had,"" is the mantra of the lame-o. Instead of focusing on what you don't have and what others do have, focus on overcoming your obstacles. Position yourself as a success story, not as a failure. Assume greatness.

, Everybody needs some assistance sometimes, but if you constantly need to ask other people for help, it can make you feel incapable and lame. Make a goal of learning as much as you need to know to comfortably negotiate your world by yourself. If you want to know how to do something, learn to do it, then do it yourself.


This especially applies to your parents. Do you need them to pay your phone bill for you, or might you take on a part-time job and take that responsibility for yourself? If you're capable of doing something, do it.
It's also lame to try to do things you know you don't know how to do, because you're too proud to ask for help. Instead of stumbling into a car repair job you don't understand, just because you're too proud to admit you don't know how to do it, be brave enough to get the help you need, so you'll know how to do it next time.

, If you want to feel proud in your own skin, start using your body in ways that make it work for you, and ways that make you feel proud. From the way you dress to the choices that you make, you want to treat your body as a thing that you have control over, not something that you're discouraged about or disappointed by.


If you're using your body in ways that don't make you happy, ways that don't make you proud, be brave enough to make a change. If you want to get active, find a physical activity that you enjoy doing and get outside and start sweating. If you drink too much or abuse other substances, take the big step of stopping. You're bigger than your vices.

, Trends and styles change so often, that there's no one way you can dress to avoid being ""lame"" at all times. Styles might be cool one season and lame the next. But isn't it kind of lame to chase after fads? To hit up the mall every couple of weeks to make sure you're as ""in"" as possible? Better to position yourself above these kinds of concerns and wear the kinds of clothes that make you feel good.


If it makes you feel good to wear what's in style, go for it. If you don't get how high-waisted pants or flat-brim caps could possibly be cool, then don't wear them.

, Confident people walk through the halls like they feel comfortable in who they are, and like they belong. Lame people walk through like they'd rather be anywhere but there. Even if you're not feeling super-confident, train yourself to walk upright, like the humans were meant to walk. Keep your shoulders back and your chin up. Walking like it'll get better will help it get better.

, Everyone's body is different and capable of different things, but it's good to know your limits and shift your limits to where you want them to be. If you want to spend a long life playing video games and working on your computer, you probably don't need to be able to bench 475, but you do have to look after your diet, make sure you get enough exercise to live long enough to see the 50 year anniversary of the Sony Playstation.


If you want to play sports, but don't want to run, you're going to be pretty lame (literally) come the sports season. Get in the kind of shape you need to be in to do what you want to do.
There's no shame in wanting to avoid the pool if you're not comfortable in a bathing suit. But if you really want to go to the pool, have the courage to go as you are and be comfortable, or make the changes you want to see.

, Any time you're nervous, you'll tend to rush. From public speaking to interpersonal interactions, people who are feeling unconfident are likely to want to get through the experience as quickly as possible. So, if you want to build confidence in yourself and get others to see you as a confident, cool person, fake it till you make it.Speak slowly and clearly, taking the time to enunciate all your words and to structure your words as accurately as possible.
Breathe. Take a minute when you're talking to take a breath, to process what is being said, and think.

, When was the last time you made eye contact with someone, and the other person broke it first? While it might seem incidental, training yourself to make more eye contact can alter people's perception of you and make you appear more confident in your one-on-one interactions. Don't be a shoe-gazer. Look people in the eye and have the confidence to keep your gaze locked. This helps to make you more confident and give other people the impression that you're a confident person.


This can, of course, be taken to creepy levels. Which would be lame. Don't stare.

, Again, there's no one way to look that's cool, and one way that's lame. It's usually lame to spend either too much time or too little time cultivating your appearance, but it is important to take pride in the way you look, and use your appearance as a confidence building tool, rather than a weight that you're constantly grappling with.


If you obsess over your wardrobe, your body, and your beauty routine, maybe you need to take a step back and build up your confidence in other areas of your life. Looks aren't everything.
If you're not a clothes horse and can't remember the last time you had a hair cut, that's fine, but basic grooming and care are important. You need to make sure to groom yourself in basic ways, to take care of your body and keep yourself clean and confident. Brush your teeth twice a day and wash your clothes, shower a few times a week, and you'll be fine.

Research and develop a plyometric routine that works best for your schedule and space.,
Integrate plyometrics into a weight lifting program.,
Practice jumping.,
Utilize box jumps.",How to Jump Higher for Volleyball2," Plyometrics are great because they require minimal equipment and require various explosive movements; however, they can be a challenge to commit to if you only have limited amount of space and time available to you. Choose exercises that will challenge you in the time you have scheduled for yourself.Here is an example of a plyometric routine specifically made to jump higher for volleyball.Do each exercise for 15 repetitions, completing the entire routine 2-3 times through.

15 Minutes of Cardio to warm up.
15 Knee Tuck Jumps: jumping straight up as you raise your knees and tuck them toward your chest.
15 Lateral Jumps: jumping side to side keeping your feet together.
15 Mountain Climbers: starting at a plank position (the top part of a pushup), quickly move your feet towards your hands, as if you were running in place with your hands securely pushed against the ground.
15 Broad Jumps: jumping forward as far as you can, from a stationary standing position, focusing on distance rather than eight.
15 Burpees: starting from a plank position, quickly move to your feet and explode into a jump (it’s a combination of a pushup and vertical jump).
15 Squat Jacks: squatting down with your feet shoulder width apart and legs bent just above a 90 degree angle, move your feet in and out, quickly moving your inner thighs towards each other.
15 Agility Dots: trace an imaginary square on the ground and jump sideways and diagonally towards each corner of the square, keeping your feet together, to create an X pattern.
15 Squat Jumps: get into a squat position and explode into a jump. Cool Down and Stretch.



, To keep yourself from getting bored and your muscles and gains from hitting a plateau, you can add plyometric workouts 2-3 times a week in conjunction with cardio and bodyweight exercises in order to jump higher. To make the plyometrics even more effective, wear a weighted vest while you do the exercises.


These plyometrics exercises should only be done on even ground to avoid sprains and injuries.
Never do the exercises on concrete as the impact can be rough on joints.

, Practice makes perfect. To increase your vertical, find a tall empty wall, grab a pack of sticky notes and start jumping. Label your first sticky note as '1st Jump' and whenever you reach the highest point of you first jump, slap the labeled sticky note onto the wall. Then grab the next sticky note, label it, and try to get that sticky note higher than the first one you put on the wall.


Jump ropes are also an excellent way to get to jumping higher and faster (after all, volleyball relies on reflexes as well).Use ankle weights, a weighted vest, or tension bands to provide resistance as you jump towards the mark. Consult a health or fitness specialist for proper technique and guided weight resistance as landing with added weights can cause injury and stress to your joints. Ideally, use specialized equipment or tension bands that provide resistance as you explode up but do not add any weight when landing back on the ground.
Make sure you're bending your knees and mimicking the movements you will be using in the game. Imagine that the wall is the net and you need to maintain the vertical plain without touching it.

, Box jumps are a common exercise for utilizing plyometrics to increase your vertical leap. Doing box jumps increases your explosion and coordination by training your muscles to explode upward.As the name states, box jumps are simply jumping up onto a box from a stationary standing position using a single step approach. Many fitness facilities have specialized boxes specifically built for this exercise. Keep doing box jump repetitions for about 10 jumps x 3 sets, 4-5 times a week for the best results.


Ensure there is enough room for you to jump without hitting your head on anything.
Ensure that the box is stable and does not slip out from under you as you land on top of it.
Slowly increase the height of the box as your vertical begins to increase.

Time your steps.,
Coordinate both arms with your footwork to generate force.,
Engage your core.",How to Jump Higher for Volleyball3," Whether you’re attacking for a spike or defending with a block, the correct footwork will maximize the height of your jump. Your footwork will depend on your dominant hand. If you are going up to spike the ball, plant your second foot facing sideways and take off facing parallel to the net. Making your last two steps fast and explosive will significantly help your vertical leap.Use 3 steps to explode into your jump to improve your accuracy. For right-handed players, use a left, right, left, jump technique.
Your spike approach should include one big step and one small step to bring your trailing foot in line with your leading one.

, The height you get on each jump partly comes from the timing of your arms. Accelerate your arm swing as you bring your second foot forward - remember, you're not swinging forward, you're swinging up. The combination of planting your second foot a little bit in front of your first and then swinging your arms upwards will stop your forward momentum and transfer it to upwards momentum. A quick, aggressive approach with your arms swinging completely back and up will drive your body into the air.Move your arms in the direction that you want to go. Force your arms downward as you squat to initiate your base. As you explode into your jump, reverse the direction of your arms and push them above your head as fast as you can. As you reach the apex of your jump, your hands and body will have uncoiled into the highest point of your jump.
If you are following the left, right, left, jump technique, throw your hands back and turn your palms to the ceiling on the right step. While you are in the air, come through with your non-dominant hand. The hand you're hitting with will usually be the dominant hand.
As you advance in the sport, adjust your footwork and coordination for different attacking and defending positioning.

, Turning your body to hit the ball will allow you to engage your core when you spike creating greater force upon impact. By using your whole body this way, you will be able to hit harder than you ever would with just your arm.Flex your core as if it were a bow about to release an arrow with your back and abdominal muscles working in unison. Working on the technique of your approach and arm swing is very important to maximizing the movements of your core.

Clean the skateboard.,
Remove parts of the skateboard.,
Attach the hat hanging hooks to the board.,
Create the mounting system for your skateboard hat hanger.,
Map out the areas where you will place the screw posts in order to mount them to the wall.,
Drill the screw posts into the blocks in order to create a ½” pre-drilled hole.,
Secure the deck to the blocks using the 3-4 inch (7.5cm-10cm) screws.,
Check for studs.,
Install the screw posts into the wall.,
Test the strength with a hanging hat.",How to Turn Your Skateboard Into a Hat Rack," Remove the skate park grime and grease from the board, as you don't want this transferring to the wall. Gentle mild detergent and warm water should do the trick. Also decide whether you'd like to keep stickers intact or not and remove or touch up any stickers or emblems on the bottom of the board. The bottom of your board will be on display so if you have any rad stickers you wanted to display or new artwork, add them now.;
, You won't need the wheels, so remove them using an electric drill. Also remove all screws from the deck as you'll be adding new screws when mounting it to the wall.

, Plan where the hats will best fit (perhaps an even three or four hooks across the board will work well). Attach as instructed by the hook packaging, either by screwing in or adhering to the board. Avoid placing hooks over the deck holes, as these are going to be needed for the mounting process.


If drilling holes to add the hooks, take care to find areas of the board firm enough to handle the drilling without breaking the board.






Another alternative to attaching hooks is to use hooks that are usually hung over a door or similar high spot. Such hooks could simply hang over the top of the board and can be easily shifted for adjusting the weight and placement of hats as needed. This leaves the board intact too. On the downside, these hooks might not be as stable as ones firmly attached to the board.







, The idea is to drill a longer screw through the deck hole and into a wooden block. This block will then be mounted to the wall. To make the block:


Obtain mounting blocks that will be used for the skateboard deck. You can either head to the hardware store and explain that you need two or three 2” (5cm) chunks of wood for mounting a skateboard, or you can grab some scrap wood for your project and measure it for yourself.
Ask the hardware employee to cut three 2” (5cm) x 1.5” (3.8cm) chunks from the piece of wood you choose. Either way, confirm that you have 2” (5cm) pieces of wood, which tend to be the best size for mounting.
Sand the blocks. If the hardware store doesn’t do this for you, use sandpaper to sand down the blocks until smooth before proceeding.

, Typically you will need two or three holes for the most secure fit.

, You will need to create holes on one side of the mounting block in order to screw them into the wall.

, Drop the screws through the deck holes and drill them into the wooden blocks. Be sure you drill them into the side that does not have the pre-drilled area.

, Use a stud detector, or knock on the wall. If you knock to hear hollow sounds, then it's good. The stud detector will beep if there is a stud. If you come across a stud, move your wall placement out or in accordingly.


Check the wall for before mounting the board for stability beams or other areas of construction that may impede mounting the board on the wall.







, Match up the pre-drilled holes to the area where you will mount the board.


Using the same screws, line up where the blocks will be located on the wall. Use a pencil as your guide and a level to ensure they aren’t crooked.
Drive the screws approximately 3/4” into the wall so they are slightly protruding. This will provide a shelf to hang your blocks.
Push the skateboard up against the blocks into the wall. Use a hammer to gently tap the board into place. For extra hold, consider placing one drop of liquid nails inside each block hole for a more permanent fit.

, Go and find a favorite hat and hang it up. The result should be a firmly held hanging hat and your wonderful old skateboard on display for all to see.

Find a local thrift store.,
Decorate your home with recycled items.,
Vacation at home.,
Walk, walk, walk.,
Have a potluck meal.,
Rent a movie from the redbox.",How to Penny Pinch Your Way to a Simpler Life," Instead of paying ridiculous amounts of money at a name brand store for a pair of pants or a new blouse that you hardly ever wear, trying shopping at a thrift store. Although not all thrift stores are exactly ideal, most offer clothes that are unique and cannot be found anywhere else. Then, not only will you wear an outfit that you found for a good deal, but you will be wearing something that no one else has.;
, You don't always have to have money saved in order to be able to update the look and style of your home. If you are wanting to add zest and personality to your home without lightening the load in your wallet, look for recycled materials to enhance your home. For instance, decorate picture frames with shells, paper mache jars, and use empty glass pop bottles as flower holders. These simple changes can take your home from blah to ooo-la-la!

, Instead of spending tons of money on a vacation that may end up classifying as an episode good enough to appear on family feud, try vacationing near home. All you need to do is borrow a tent, find a friend who lives near a wooded area, and buy some smores ingredients and viola! You can camp in your own backyard! If you do not like to camp, travel within your own state and find hotel deals so you can enjoy your vacation and still remain debt free.

, Gas these days is definitely on the high end and one alternative that remains cheap and good for you is walking. Walking allows you to on save gas while getting a good amount of exercise that we often deny ourselves of. Walking also gives you the chance to enjoy the scenery and take a breather from the chaos of your daily agenda. So take a walk today and give your wallet a break

, As the price of gas rises, the price of food becomes more and more expensive. Instead of having your own family dinners that force you to either eat too little on little money or eat too much on too much money, have a potluck dinner instead. Potlucks give you a chance to make only one dish, which saves you more money in the long run. It also allows you to try different kinds of foods that your friends make.

, When seeing previews for a movie that is coming out, our first reaction is to want to go to the theatres the minute it comes out. However, going to the movies is not always the best choice to make, especially if we are trying to save money. a cheap alternative would be to wait until the movie is released to the redbox. Redboxes allow you to rent a movie for a night for only $1 and, even though you have to wait for the movie to come out, you can save a whole lot more than if you went to the movies.

Wear lingerie that covers the spots that worry you.,
Be in control of the lighting.,
Don't undress all the way.,
Wrap yourself in a blanket or towel when leaving the room.",How to Not Be Seen Naked1," Feeling self-conscious about your tummy? Try a corset to cinch your waist and push up your breasts, or a babydoll top for coverage and support. The important thing is to find something you like that highlights your best assets.Branch out beyond the usual lingerie styles, too. Consider burlesque-inspired, tomboy, and indie designers for new takes on sexy underthings.Costumes and role-playing may also help you stay covered while ramping up your bedroom activities.;
, It's helpful if your partner can come to your house, so you can feel a little less anxious and have more control over the environment. While you can simply turn the lights off, you may want to try a few candles or installing a dimmer switch. Low lighting is more flattering, and you and your partner can see enough of each other to feel intimate and connected.Use soft light bulbs in the bedroom, which can also provide more flattering light.
If you're having sex in the morning, wait to open the blinds or curtains, and leave the lights off. It may still be dark enough for you to feel comfortable.

, Leave your bra or t-shirt on. Or keep your skirt on but nothing else. Or even slip into your partner's shirt. Covering up a little can help make you feel comfortable enough that you still enjoy yourself.Some types of sex are perfect for staying clothed. If you initiate a sudden, passionate ""quickie,"" you may not even have time to get your clothes off.

, If you're self-conscious about getting up to use the bathroom, keep a nice, fluffy robe within reach of your bed. If you don't have a robe available, pull a sheet or blanket off the bed and wear it under your arms like a towel.


This is another opportunity for you to pop on your partner's shirt, especially if he or she is a little larger than you are or about the same size.

Gather the items that you will need to measure yourself.,
Choose the right spot to measure yourself.,
Get yourself ready to measure your height.,
Follow these directions to start measuring yourself.,
Mark the position above the top of your head on the wall with a pencil.,
Measure from the floor to the pencil mark with a measuring tape.",How to Measure Your Height by Yourself1," Make sure that you have the following:


A measuring tape, a ruler or a yardstick
A mirror
A pencil
A small box or thick book;
, Pick a location that meets these requirements:


Find a flat, open space of floor next to a wall.
Find a place where you can stand with your back to the wall.
Find a place where you can make a small pencil mark on the wall.Stand on a hard floor made of concrete, title or hardwood. Avoid floors covered by carpets or rugs.
Try to find a space next to a door or in a corner to help guide your measuring tape.
Try to find a location that faces a mirror to eliminate the need for a hand mirror.

, Make sure to do the following:


Take off your socks and shoes. Measure your height when you are barefoot because flip flops, slippers, and even socks will affect the measurement.
Remove anything from your head. Don’t wear a hat, a headband or a ponytail. Keep your hair flat.Stand with your back against the wall and your feet together. Stand up as straight as possible with your heels, back, shoulders, and head all touching the wall. Tuck in your chin and look straight ahead., Make sure that can easily reach anything that you might need while measuring yourself.


Hold the box in one hand, and the mirror and pencil in the other.
Raise the small box to the top of your head, and press it against the wall.
Use the mirror to make sure the box is horizontal to the floor and perpendicular to the wall, forming a right angle.Do not tilt the box as this will cause an inaccurate measurement.

, Make sure not to move the box or your finger as you do this.


Mark the place on the wall where the bottom of the box is resting. Hold the box in its position and slide out from under it, if possible.
Try putting your finger at the bottom of the box and hold it in position as you slide out of position.
You may be able to make the mark without sliding out of position at all.

, Keep the measuring tape flat against the wall.


If your measuring tape is too short to measure your full height, measure as high as you can and make a pencil mark on the wall.
Note the measurement.
Keep measuring this until you reach the pencil mark you made using the box.
Add the individual measurements together to get your height.

Find a full length body mirror.,
Take off your clothes.,
Place your feet together.,
Know the difference between your waist and hips.,
Find the widest point.,
Hold a cloth tape measure on one hip.,
Go around the back.,
Check in the mirror.,
Make it snug.,
Read the measurement.,
Write down your hip measurement.,
Add a few inches when making clothing.",How to Measure Hips," Although the hips are easier to measure by yourself than other areas of the body, a mirror will help you ensure the tape is not twisted or uneven. Therefore, stand in front of one to get your measurement., Remove your outer garments, such as your pants and shirt. You can leave on thin underwear and still obtain an accurate measurement. Wearing jeans or anything else too bulky will change the measurement.If you always wear the same bulky clothes, you can leave them on if you're just measuring to judge how much weight you've lost.
However, if you're measuring for a pattern or clothes, it's important to be as accurate as possible.

, Having your feet apart can create a measurement that's actually larger than your hip area. Put your feet together to take the measurement. At the very least, your feet shouldn't be wider than your shoulders, but together is better., Your natural waist is the smallest part of your torso, where your body dips in. Your hips are below that, and they are usually wider than your waist. Your hip measurement includes your butt and your hips., Your hip measurements should be taken at where your hips are the widest. That's because when you're taking measurements, you're trying to get an accurate representation of your body, and the hips represent the widest point on your bottom half. For clothes to fit accurately, you need to find the widest point.Once you have your tape measure in place, you may need to move up or down an inch or two to find the widest spot.

, Hold one end on one hip. It doesn't matter which side you start with. You can also pull it more towards your middle if that's easier for you. Just make sure you hold on to that end as you bring the other end around.Cloth measuring tapes are soft and flexible tools you can find in sewing kits and craft stores. Most measuring tapes go up to 5 five or so. Most big box stores and drug stores will also carry sewing kits.You can also print a tape measure off the internet. You can find these with a simple search online. You simply cut them apart, align the edges, and then glue or tape them together.Of course, you need to be careful with this type of tape measure, as it can rip easily. However, don't try to use card stock, as that can be too stiff to get a good measurement.
Don't use metal measuring tapes. Metal measuring tapes, the kind you use for do-it-yourself improvement projects, are not good for taking measurements of your body. They aren't flexible enough, so they won't give you an accurate measurement., Wrap it around your backside, being careful to make sure it doesn't twist. Pull the tape around to the other end from the other hip. Make sure you are getting it around your rear end at the same time.You can also start out holding both ends and step over the tape so it's on your back side. This movement can help if you have trouble wrapping it around the back.

, Now that you've got it wrapped around, check to make sure you've got it right in the mirror. The tape should be parallel to the floor all around, and it shouldn't be twisted at all. Make sure it looks even.You'll need to shift around to check out the back side of the tape. Turn to the side so you can see.

, When measuring, the tape should be snug around your hips. However, it shouldn't be cutting off circulation. It should be tight enough that you can only fit a finger underneath it, no more., You can look down to find out your measurement. You measurement is where the end of the tape meets a number as the tape measure comes around. You may need to look in the mirror to read the number more easily.

, Now that you've figured out what your hip measurement is, write it down so you can save it for later. You'll also need other measurements to make clothing, such as your bust, hip, thighs, waist, and inseam, depending on what you're making.Like your hips, you measure your thigh at the thickest part of your leg.
The inseam is the inside of your leg from your crotch to where you want your pants to fall. If you have a pair of pants that are the length, you can measure the inseam on them instead of your body.

, When you make clothing, you don't make it to your exact measurements because then it would be skin-tight, which would mean it would be difficult to move. Therefore, you must add a few inches to make it more wearable.You add inches for two reasons. One, as already stated, is to make the clothing more wearable. However, you might also add inches to create a design. For instance, if you want a really flowing, poofy skirt, you might add more inches at the hip than for an a-line skirt.
How much the cloth gives also affects how many inches you add. That is, if it is especially stretchy, you probably don't need to add as many inches.
Most patterns will help you determine how many inches to add. However, if you are doing it yourself, you should add 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10 cm), depending on how tight or loose you want your clothing.
Also, if you're a bit curvier, you may want to add more inches to allow for better movement.

Use disinfectant wipes instead of showering.,
Wear a towel to and from the shower.,
Try to shower when very few people are around.,
Rearrange your schedule if you're a student, making gym your last class of the day.,
Get a letter from your parents if you can't get comfortable.",How to Not Be Seen Naked2," If you haven't worked up a major sweat, a disinfectant wipe may be sufficient to get yourself clean.Some schools are even handing these out to students in gym class instead of requiring a shower. Just bring a pack in your gym bag and wipe down your armpits and other smelly spots.


If you're self-conscious about this, you can wipe yourself down in a bathroom stall.

, Stop at your locker to pick up a towel. You can secure the towel around your waist and then slip out of your pants. Remove your shirt next and quickly slide the towel up under your armpits if you want to cover your chest.


You can bring your towel into a bathroom stall and change out of your clothes in the stall. Then emerge already wearing the towel and no one will have seen you change.

, If you're going to a neighborhood gym, try not to go during peak hours. During lunch or right after work, there's bound to be tons of people at the gym, and so it's more likely the locker room (and showers) will be crowded. Ask a trainer or the person at the desk when the gym is least crowded, then try to fit your work out in during those hours.


If you're in gym class and trying to avoid showering with your classmates, talk to your teacher and ask if you may shower after everyone else has done so.
You can also try to wait the other students out, taking your time so that most other people are finished showering by the time you are ready.

, If your school insists on students showering after gym class, talk to a school administrator and see if you can take gym during final period. It will be much easier to talk your teacher or coach into letting you skip the shower if you assure him or her that you're going to rinse off when you get home.


Part of the reason your school wants you to shower is that if students don't clean off after exercising, they may spread serious diseases like MRSA.If you're going straight home after gym, however, the chances of that are slim.

, If you are experiencing bullying or terrible anxiety because you have to shower at school, ask your parents to write a note to your teacher.You may have to meet with your gym teacher or a guidance counselor, with or without your parents, but if the situation in severe, you may be excused.

Practice being nude.,
Move your body in ways that make you feel good.,
Connect to a time when you felt accepting of yourself.,
Remember that you're your own worst critic.",How to Not Be Seen Naked3," It sounds weird, but when you think about it, most people only spend a few minutes a day in the buff. You can't get better or more at ease with something if you don't practice. Lock your door and add five minutes of nudity to your morning ritual.


If you're a girl who wears makeup, delay getting dressed while you apply your makeup.
Do something that makes you feel good and pampered while you're having naked time. Rub a nice-smelling lotion all over your body, brush through your hair, even close your eyes and meditate.You want to start creating a positive connection with being naked.

, Do you like to dance? Swim? Practice yoga or hike? People who exercise for fun improve their self image while improving their bodies.If you hate running, don't hit the treadmill! Try a Zumba dance class or playing a sport instead.


Focus on making your body strong and capable, and not on how it looks.

, For some, you may have to go all the way back to childhood, but try to remember a time when you weren't self-conscious about your body.Try to find a picture of yourself from that time and refer to it when you need a reminder that you don't need to be so hard on yourself.


Even if you had a rough childhood, focus on the fact that you had enough strength to survive it and get where you are today., If you're terribly self-conscious about your partner seeing you naked because you think they'll lose interest, think again. Your partner isn't checking out your stretch marks or cellulite. You partner isn't thinking you're to big or skinny. They're just psyched to be getting naked with you!


Focus on being present with your partner. Instead of tearing yourself down, allow yourself to feel and enjoy the moment.
Your partner has his or her own insecurities and imperfections, but does that stop you from loving them or wanting to be intimate with them? Try to remember how good and generous feel toward them, and imagine that they feel the same way about you.

Find a stadiometer to help measure your height.,
Get yourself ready to measure your height.,
Adjust the horizontal arm on the stadiometer so that it is resting on the top of your head.,
Find your height on the stadiometer.",How to Measure Your Height by Yourself2," Look for a stadiometer at a doctor's office or a gym.Find a digital stadiometer if possible. Using a digital stadiometer will yield a more accurate result.
Look for a stadiometer that is constructed out of a ruler and a sliding horizontal headpiece that you can adjust to rest on the top of the head.
Consider asking your doctor to measure your height with a stadiometer.

, Make sure to do the following:


Take off your socks and shoes. Measure your height when you are barefoot because flip flops, slippers, and even socks will affect the measurement.
Remove anything from your head. Don’t wear a hat, a headband or a ponytail. Press down on the stadiometer to keep your hair flat.Stand on the stadiometer platform with your back against the wall and your feet together. Stand up as straight as possible with your heels, back, shoulders, and head all touching the wall. Tuck in your chin and look straight ahead., Be aware that you can move this arm up and down. Make sure that vertical arm works properly before trying to measure yourself.
Keep in mind that you may need to fold or flip the horizontal arm up so that it is perpendicular with the floor.

, Step out from underneath the horizontal arm once you have adjusted it correctly and look for the measurement.


Keep in mind that your height will be displayed on the vertical pole of the stadiometer.
Look for an arrow pointing to the measurement at the base of the horizontal arm.
Be aware that digital stadiometers will display your height on a small screen instead.

Choose a soundtrack.",How to Film Skateboarding," Primarily, the most cost-effective and high-quality cameras that you can use easily are Mini-DVs that record digitally to tape. The quality is high enough, the tapes are easy to store, and the cameras are widely available and cheap enough that it's usually the best option.


A small Panasonic or Sony camcorder usually runs between $300 and $500. Sony premiums are the most popular Mini-DV cameras among skaters, useful for their portability and quality. More expensive options might include the Sony vx1000, vx2000 or a vx2100, which are professional-quality, but probably excessive for the beginner.
Make sure you have a Firewire 400 port on your computer. Ideally, Mini-DVs should also use LP mode for maximum quality of the footage.;
, Fisheye lenses is useful for keeping both the skater and the obstacle in the frame, allowing the lens to maximize the width of the field of vision, giving the impression that we're both very close to the action and far enough away to see everything happen. It also helps smaller objects appear somewhat larger, or taller. It's a common trick that's both practical, psychedelic, and just plain cool.

, You're not going to be able to edit on the fly while you're trying to skate around, do tricks, and finding an easy-to-use editing software will help make your video professional and straightforward. Before you film anything, make sure you'll have an easy way to edit it.


There are lots of free editing options, like iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, Avidemux, all of which are standard or available for free. While not necessarily as professional, these programs are simple to use and should result in high-quality videos that are perfect for beginners.
Professional options, like Final Cut Pro, VideoStudio Pro are available if you want a wider variety of options during the editing process and a higher-quality video product in the end.

, Before you go out filming, do some scouting to find good places to shoot video. It's no use to waste time carrying around a camera while you and your friends look for a place to make a video. Do that work ahead of time. Find a good spot with good easy-to-film, but challenging obstacles, so that you'll have something worth remembering.


Ideally, it would be good to find a place with several different varieties of obstacle. A good grinding rail? A good set of concrete stairs? A gap? Try to find a park or a plaza with everything you'll need for some good tricks and enough space to do them in.
Make sure that wherever you're planning on filming is skater friendly and that you're not trespassing on private property. It's more traditional to film in locations that aren't full-on skateparks, to illustrate your ingenuity and creativity, but a skate park would be a fine place to film, as well.

, It'll be more time-efficient to film many skaters at once, who are all trying to do the same, or different, tricks. If you're trying to film your friend do a 360 hard-flip, it might waste a lot of camera battery and space to keeping waiting for re-starts and recoveries. If you can keep filming different people, though, you'll end up with a lot more good footage that you can edit together in the end.

, Try to always buy and bring two of everything to a filming session. Get two batteries, two tapes, even consider getting an extra lens if necessary. Because it can be so difficult to coordinate getting a bunch of skaters together and getting the trick worked out to a filmable quality, you don't want to have to cut the day short because you've run out of batteries. Never miss that critical shot by staying prepared ahead of time.

, If you're the designated camera-person, make sure that you focus on your own skating and stay safe, regardless of who you're filming or how many skaters you're filming. Don't look through the camera lens and pay too much attention to your camera work, focus on staying on your board and balancing.


If you're filming yourself, consider setting up your camera on a tripod. Mark the spot on the concrete that's the center of the frame with sidewalk chalk, so you'll know where to pull your trick.
If you're skating and filming others, don't try to get too fancy with your footwork while you're doing it. Just focus on smooth skating and keeping the camera steady to give their tricks the camerawork they deserve.

, Whether you're standing still or skating along with the people you're filming, you want to make sure you don't get too caught up in the fun of filming and lose track of where you're going. Becoming an obstacle between you and your buddies pulling off a trick is a good way to get your camera cracked, your face busted, and to lose some skater buds.


Even if you're posted up at the bottom of a set of stairs, toward which your friends are jumping, stay curled up and stay in one place. Don't move elsewhere to Try to find another spot. Stay steady and let them work around you. Stay far enough back from the staircase to give them room enough to land the jump and roll for a few feet without hitting you, giving yourself enough time to get out of the way if necessary.

, Start filming early and keep filming late. When someone stomps something big, always keep the camera rolling. You’ll never have too much footage. You always want to do this to avoid missing those rare moments of brilliance because you're too concerned about your tapes. If you go out with a blank tape, make sure you come back with a full one.


Don’t try to edit on the fly. Worry about editing together the footage later. Just think of yourself as a collector of moments for the time being. Your job isn’t to finish the video today, it’s to make sure you get all the best shots.
Film the fails, too. Don't just worry about filming the tricks. A roll full of nothing but spinning boards get dull after a while, so it's a good idea to film your friends talking smack, comparing scraped knees, and joking around. Perform for the camera.

, Footage of disembodied feet doing a trick isn't much fun to watch. It'll look jerky, confusing, and less impressive to only see half of your friend pulling off a sick trick, so it's important to set up your camera to keep the whole skater in the frame during the entirety of the trick. Let the viewer appreciate the full range of motion and athleticism necessary in pulling off a trick.


Try not to zoom while using a fisheye. Most are designed to be used in the telephoto position and zooming will cause it to go out of focus. Messing around with the zoom too much will also make the film appear super-shaky. Don't try to get too fancy with it, just be there to document the tricks and catch the magic.
Don't film with a fisheye for everything. Specially, fisheye lenses should be used for big gaps or sets, not more compact tricks. If the trick is going to be big, use a wide angle or fisheye of .63x - .3x is suggested for an added wide-angle flavor and for making sure that you get the full range of side-to-side grinds and other things that will require a big range of motion.
Use manual focus. Don't turn the option of steadyshot on with a fisheye, it will distort the vignetting.

, A common mistake that beginners make when trying to film tricks is moving the camera too much to Try to focus on the skater, rather than letting the trick come into the frame. Focus the camera on the stairs or whatever other obstacle will be involved in the trick, until seconds away from executing the trick.


Point the camera up so you have both the body of the skater and the entire stairs in focus.
A common successful angle is at 3 feet (0.9 m). from the bottom of the stairs, out of the passing way with you crouched down so camera almost touches the ground. Start recording when the skater is about 5 or 10 feet (1.5 or 3.0 m). away from the top of the staircase.

, Leave as little ground in the frame as possible, if you can, to make the trick look much better. If your bud’s having some trouble sticking the jump, having less of a reference point for the after-trick wobbling and balance-grabbing will make the footage look that much better. Frame it so that we see the skater upon landing, and not much else.

, Another classic shot will require you to move while you film, preferably skating. If your friend wants to try a long grind, or a set of tricks along a line, you'll need to hop on your board and run parallel to the trick. Set the camera to focus on the skater, setting the depth of the field so it won't be blurry. Try to maintain the same distance from the skater as you film.


It's important to film instead of jogging or walking quickly, since the footsteps will jostle the camera and make it difficult to watch. Skating will help the footage to stay nice and smooth.

, There are the common ways to film, but the choice of the angle, the way you want to edit, and the shots you choose to keep is up to you. Practice until you get it right. Keeping track of the distances you are using, and the distance that gives the best picture.Try filming at different times of day. This will give you more footage to work with later when trying to add diversity to a full length film.

, Use the Firewire port to hook up your camera to the computer and upload the footage. The specific process will depending upon the type of editing software and the camera that you use, but you'll always need to upload the footage to the computer first and save a copy. Never start editing away footage until you save the footage. If you make a mistake, or decide that you want to use another take of a certain trick, you want to make sure that you've got the original to work form.


Alternatively, you might leave the raw footage on the tape until you've edited it thoroughly, before clearing it off the tape itself. This will help you to save hard drive space., The first and most important part of the process involves trimming out the repeats, the dull bits, and the otherwise unusable footage. Start trimming the fat and cutting everything into the best bits. Save the funniest parts, the most successful tricks, and some intro footage of all of the skaters involved just skating around, looking cool.


The best skate videos will have a mixture of different types of scenes and tricks, high spots and low spots to create drama and tension to the video. A skate video of all insane tricks will be hard to watch.Save some epic fails to edit in, as well. If your friend face-plants, it can be a good scene to include, reminding viewers what skaters risk each and every time they hop on the board.

, For the most part, skate videos are given soundtracks to be played with music, rather than featuring the found-sounds during the filming process. Since the sounds are mostly repetitive whooshes and wheel-on-concrete noises, it's not the most interesting stuff to listen to. It's good to vary the sound, though, and keep a bit of the natural sounds around to cut in if you want to. Especially big cheers when a trick hits, helps to make a video seem cool and fun.


Probably don't worry about including external microphones and other types of recording. Just let the camera record natural sound.

, Lots of skate videos are too dark or washed out, which means the colors and contrast will need to be adjusted in the editing process. You want to make sure that a viewer can see all the details clearly and the video quality is sharp and high-quality as possible.


Don't mess around with goofy filters or other effects in the editing software. Using silly transitions make videos look amateur. Even if all you're going to do is put it on YouTube, it's worth making it look great.

, You don't have to stick to the order that the tricks happened in originally. Put them in whatever order you want to make the video seem exciting, dramatic, and fun. Start slow and work up to the biggest, most dramatic tricks. Let us see some big fails and scraped knees before finally hitting a big jump, or nailing a kick flip. Make the viewer want to see you succeed.


Be careful not to make your video too jerky, or too quick. Beginning editors have a tendency to want to cut off the trick immediately when it ends, or just as it begins, which can make the viewer feel a bit nauseated. Leave a bit of lead-up to the trick and let the scene go a beat farther after the skater lands the trick. This will help to build up the suspense more, and the viewer will appreciate what we’ve seen much more easily.

, A good skate video needs a great soundtrack, and most editing software makes it super-easy to cut in your own music and back the video. What were you listening to that got you all psyched up for skating originally? You might go with the originals, or go with some standbys of the skate genre. Pick what you like.


So-Cal punk, instrumental hip-hop, and thrash-metal would all be perfect skater soundtracks. There's no perfect record, but you can't go wrong with some OFF! or Gizmos. Skate videos should be rebellious, humorous, and fun in equal measure. Pick a soundtrack that'll make that clear.

Choose a hair color that is within one or two shades of your natural color so that it is easy to maintain, and won't look ridiculous once your roots grow in. If you want to go lighter, consider adding subtle highlights rather than a new overall color.
Take your face shape into account when finding the right haircut. The idea is to play up your natural features and avoid exaggerating the face shape. Consider the following hairstyle suggestions: Women with round faces look good with asymmetrical hairstyles with a side part.Women with square faces should try angled bobs, long or medium-length layered cuts, or side-swept bangs. Women with long, thin faces look good with short or medium-length hair with subtle waves, and should avoid getting blunt, straight-across bangs.Those with oval or heart-shaped faces can pull of pretty much any hairstyle (lucky them). The key is to experiment!;
, Not only will this improve your overall appearance, it will help prevent the development and spread of infections and other illnesses. Brush your teeth every morning and evening. This will help keep your teeth white, leave you with fresh breath, and most importantly, keep your teeth and gums healthy.
Shower every day, even if you don't want to wash your hair. If you don't have time to shower, be sure to at least rinse your face and underarms with a washcloth and soap.
Shave, tweeze, wax and/or pluck when necessary. If you're going for a ""natural"" or ""rugged"" look, that's fine too, but do it consciously, not out of laziness.

, Feeling confident about your skin is key, because it is the first thing everybody sees when they look at you. If you are worried about blemishes, scars, or sunspots, then talk to your dermatologist to find the appropriate treatment options. There are various creams and ointments out there to help fade dark spots or scars.


Wear sunscreen or a hat if you plan on being out in the sun for an extended period of time. This will prevent sunburns and dark spots, and even more importantly, will protect your skin from the harmful effects of sun exposure.
Drink water. Staying hydrated keeps your skin looking healthy and radiant, and gives you the energy you need to stay healthy. , This doesn't necessarily mean losing weight; it means whatever you want it to mean. If you would like to drop a few pounds, then reduce your caloric intake and incorporate cardio exercises into your daily routine. If you want to gain muscle, then do resistance training and be sure to eat a protein-rich diet.


Eat fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. These foods are rich in the vitamins and nutrients your body needs, and will keep your body looking and feeling great.
Watch out for extra sugars. Be sure to read food labels and beware of extra sugars that are added to dressings, breads, and sauces.
Cut down on alcohol. Not only will this improve your skin by preventing dehydration, it will save you from consuming unnecessary calories. Join a gym or find an exercise buddy. Exercising with others will help keep you motivated.

, Regardless of the occasion or what's ""in"" at the moment, looking your best means wearing clothes that look good on you. Trends come and go, and not all of them are figure-flattering.


Show off your best assets, and cover up your worst ones. For example, if you have an hourglass figure, wear form-fitting dresses that show off your curves and avoid bulky or boxy clothes.
Ignore the size on the label. Many women go out of their way to squeeze into a pair of jeans that are too small for them out of fear of ""going up a size."" In reality, how you look in the clothes matters more than the number on the tag. Plus, nobody needs to know what size your pants are!

, Constantly pouting makes you look intimidating, serious, and boring. What's the point of looking beautiful if everybody is afraid of talking to you?

, If you want to attract others, you will have to put yourself out there. Try not to cross your arms, avoid eye contact or stand in the corner of the room. These are signs that you don't want to be bothered.

, Even supermodels have insecurities. The key is to have a sense of humor about your imperfections, and not let them drag you down. Even if you don't believe it, get in the habit of telling yourself you are beautiful, and that you look great. Eventually, you will trick yourself into genuinely believing it.

, Everybody wants to be around people who make them laugh. This doesn't necessarily mean cracking jokes every five minutes; even having the ability to laugh at other peoples' jokes shows that you are a happy, fun-loving person.

, If your skin is on the shinier side, choose a makeup with a matte finish, or use a powder. If your skin tends to be dry, choose a liquid foundation.


When testing foundation colors, be sure that you are in a well-lit area, using natural light if possible. Test a few different colors on your jawline, gently rubbing the foundation in. Use a hand mirror to determine which color is best. The perfect color should blend evenly into your skin so that you can no longer see it.
Ask an associate at the makeup counter to help match you with the right color if you are having trouble doing it yourself.

, Having an even complexion will make you look younger and more attractive. Examples of problem areas include dark under-eye rings, blemishes, scars, and/or dark spots.


Your concealer should be a shade or two lighter than your overall foundation, and of a thicker consistency.

, The key is to enhance your beauty without looking as though you've piled on makeup. Choose a routine that only takes a few minutes so that you can do it everyday. Use the following guidelines to achieve a natural, radiant face:


Moisturize your skin. This will help set the makeup and remove any dryness.
Apply overall foundation and concealer, if necessary.
Wear mascara. Even if you wear no other makeup, a touch of mascara will instantly enhance your eyes and make you look more feminine.
Add some pink. Shades of pink match all skin tones, since we all have a little natural pink in our skin. Applying a subtle blush to your cheeks will give you a warm, sun-kissed glow.
Apply a subtle lip color. Choose a color that is one to two shades deeper than your natural lip color.

Add more high heels and platforms to your wardrobe.,
Wear shoes that are close to your skin tone.,
Match your shoes with your pants or stockings.,
Avoid ankle straps.,
Wear long boots.,
Go for a pointed toe.",How to Make Your Legs Look Longer1," The most obvious way to make your legs seem longer is to wear shoes that add inches to your height. High heels will also force your feet to extend, which makes your calves look longer and more shapely.


Avoid wearing heels too often. Over time, high heels can damage your joints and cause chronic back pain.;
, A shoe that blends in with your skin will create a long, uninterrupted line when you're wearing skirts or shorts. Both the solid color and added length from your feet will create the illusion of longer legs., You can also create that same uninterrupted line by coordinating your shoes when wearing tights or pants. For example, try wearing black hosiery with black heels. This monochromatic look creates a clean line as the eye travels from the top of your leg straight down to the floor without stopping., The horizontal straps cause the viewer's eye to pause early, making your legs look shorter. Ankle straps have the opposite effect of high heels and v-shaped cuts. If you love ankle straps, consider wearing tights in the same color as the strap to prevent the line of your legs from being broken up., Over-the-knee boots create a clean, uninterrupted look from your lower thigh down to the floor. Knee high boots have a similar but less exaggerated effect. Ankle boots, on the other hand, cut your leg off just above the foot. Like ankle straps, they make your legs look shorter than they are.


An ankle boot with a v-cut at its top instead of a horizontal line is exempt from this rule. A pointed v-cut ankle boot can even make your legs look longer in its own right, as they extend the line of your legs downwards., A pointed toe will extend your feet (and your legs) twofold: First, shoes with pointed toes typically have at least an inch or two of extra space making them physically longer than a round-toe shoe in the same size. Second, the tapering point also creates the illusion that your feet (and consequently legs) are even longer."

Know why hand circumference is useful.,
Ask a friend for help.,
Hold your hand up.,
Measure the hand.,
Record the measurement.,
Find your glove size.",How to Measure Hand Size1," This is the standard metric that manufacturers use for glove sizing. Circumference is measured around the meat of the hand, from where the pinkie meets the palm to where the pointer finger meets the palm. If you have access to the gloves in person, you can simply try them on – but it may be useful to have your measurements on hand if you are ordering gloves online or getting them custom-tailored.;
, This measurement will be much easier if you have someone to assist you. If possible, measure your dominant hand to get an accurate hand size for gloves.

, If someone else is measuring for you, hold your palm out like you are going to wave to them. If you are measuring your own hand circumference, it might be easier to look at your palm. Keep your fingers extended, and let your thumb rest in a normal, comfortable position.

, Wrap a fabric-measuring tape around the hand at the fullest part, where your fingers meet your palm. This usually stretches around from the outer side of the palm (just below the pinkie finger) to the inner crook of the hand (between the index finger and thumb). Do not measure the outside of the thumb – just the palm.


If you don't have a fabric-measuring tape, just use a string or a long strip of paper. Wrap the string (or other loose length reference) around your palm as you would use a measuring tape, and be sure to mark off where the end of the string meets the looped length. Now, unfurl the string and measure the marked portion with a ruler.

, Read the number at the point where the end of the fabric-measuring tape overlaps with the rest of the length. Adult hands are usually between 6 inches (15.2 cm) and 11 inches (27.9 cm). Kids generally have a hand size between one and six inches. The number of inches of circumference directly correlates to the glove size., Once you've measured the circumference of your hand, you can compare the number against the ""standard"" measurements in order to find your glove size.Review the hand circumferences that guide the standard glove sizes:


XS: 7 inches (17.8 cm)
S: 7.5–8 inches (19.1–20.3 cm)
M: 8.5–9 inches (21.6–22.9 cm)
L: 9.5–10 inches (24.1–25.4 cm)
XL: 10.5–11 inches (26.7–27.9 cm)
XXL: 11.5–12 inches (29.2–30.5 cm)

Have fun!",How to Make Your Appearance Reflect on Who You Are," Consider what colors interest you, what kind of style you like and what simply makes you feel good about yourself.;
, Most people's natural hair color matches their skin tone anyway, but if it doesn't you should think about dyeing it a color slightly darker than your skin tone. You should also take good care of your hair by bathing every day, grooming hair and using a good shampoo and conditioner. It is also nice to trim your hair with a pair of scissors once a week in between your hair salon appointments. Use a heat protecting spray before straightening and drying hair to keep it healthy. Brushing hair regularly will also help.

, Drink as much water and eat as much fruit and vegetables as possible. Exfoliate gently before going to bed and then dry with a face towel, not the one that you wipe your hands with. You should also exfoliate the rest of your body about 3+ times a week and invest in a foot exfoliator and some moisturizer which will keep your body fresh and clean. Buy a pot of face mask, and then use it a few times a week to cleanse your pores.

, When going shopping, you should be in the right mood first. You will want to choose clothes which are the same sort of pattern and style, which is why you should think carefully about it before going. The style of clothing you choose should embrace your personality whilst suiting your skin tone and complementing your figure. When buying shoes make sure you have comfy ones like pumps which will match your style, also think about investing in some Converse as they up your cool factor and are amazingly comfy. Even consider buying some classy heels if they go with the look you are going for, but make sure they don't look trashy.


When in the shops you should buy essentials but also buy a jacket which excites you to add a splash of personality to your wardrobe, remember the phrase 'I wear what I like so I like what I wear'. This is to remind you not to wear anything you have not fallen in love with yet. Also go shopping with a friend who can get you started.

, If you feel you need foundation and powder, buy one which is the exact color of your skin tone. This way it'll cover up your pores but your makeup won't look so cakey. Wearing mascara and eyeliner is great if your skin is dark toned as it can look amazing, just make sure it's not a cheap one and you don't overdo it. If your skin is light or fair toned, it may be best not to wear any, but a splash of eye shadow that complements your skin tone won't hurt. And finally, for your lips, you should buy a lip exfoliator and use it in the morning or night, or even both! You can also use Vaseline throughout the day and if you have dark skin, a sexy red lipstick will look great!

, Maybe taking a brisk walk once or twice a day, or even joining a fitness or swimming class. Dancing can be great for appearance and can help your posture, rhythm and exercise also releases endorphins making you instantly happy and feel great. And remember, beauty begins on the inside.

, Making friends and having fun, being happy. It can prove amazing for your appearance. Being happy makes you care about detail and makes you eager, having friends who take care of their appearance can be a great influence on you and even give you extra ideas.

Combine the beeswax and olive oil.,
Melt the mixture on the stove.,
Pour the mixture into a container and let it cool.",How to Make Vaseline1," Add 1 ounce (28 g) of beeswax and ½ cup (118 ml) of olive oil to a small sauce pan. There’s no need to stir the ingredients because they won’t combine until the beeswax begins to melt.It’s usually easier to use beeswax pellets instead of a block. They’re easier to measure and usually melt more quickly.
Be sure to choose yellow beeswax pellets rather than white pellets. White pellets have undergone a refining process so many of their natural properties have been stripped away.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to low. Allow the mixture to heat until the beeswax melts completely, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.As the beeswax starts to melt, stir the mixture occasionally to ensure that the ingredients combine fully.

, Once the beeswax has melted and combined with the olive oil, remove the pan from the heat. Carefully pour it into a glass jar or container, and allow it to cool for a couple of hours. That will allow the mixture to solidify slightly so it has the same texture as Vaseline.Choose a container for the mixture that has a lid so dust, dirt, and other debris don’t wind up in your “Vaseline.”

Identify the scale of the decision you need to make.,
Get rid of the bad options.,
Place a dollar value on your decision-making time.,
Find a strategic objective.,
Aim for an adequate choice.,
Don't wait for the perfect choice.",How to Make a Quick Decision1," You should put your decision into either a small, mid-term or big decision category. Differentiating the relative importance of the decision in your life or business will allow you to put an appropriate amount of time and effort into it. If you are trying to determine which vacuum cleaner to purchase, for instance, you should put less time and energy into the decision than if you were deciding whether to marry someone. A small decision would be deciding what to eat for dinner or which shampoo to purchase.
A mid-term decision would be figuring out whether to work with someone on a new project.
A big decision would be deciding whether to pursue a new career.;
, When you look at your decision, you may notice a number of options that your gut tells you will be bad for your life or business.Cross off these options right away. Now that you have them off your list, you can focus on choosing from amongst the better options., Break each hour into ten slots of six minutes. Based on how much you make per hour, determine the dollar value of six minutes of your time. Don’t spend more time and money on decisions that will not have a big impact on your work or finances.To determine how much time and money to spend on a decision, you may also find it helpful to consider the following:The impact of the decision on other people.
The impact of the decision on your place of work.
The financial impacts of the decision.
Your level of responsibility for the decision.
The outcomes of a poor decision.

, You may find it helpful to reduce the number of criteria that bear on your decision. Although you may have multiple criteria to fulfill with the decision, you should try to distill the key criteria into a strategic objective. Your strategic objective should fulfill one or two of the most important criteria. , Although it would be fantastic if there were a choice that fulfilled everything we were looking for, life rarely presents us with this situation. So, you may as well figure out what you need in order to make an adequate choice. An adequate decision will be one that meets the minimum criteria that you set for yourself, as opposed to the ideal conditions. Once you have found a choice that meets your minimum criteria, make the decision and move on with life.If you are looking for a new car, figure out the most important criteria that you need to meet in order to find a car that will work for your life. Once you have found a car that meets these criteria (price, color, model, year), make your choice and move on with life.

, If you find yourself waiting around for a choice that meets your ideal set of conditions, you could end up doing research or contemplating the decision for a very long time. Instead of waiting for an ideal choice, figure out which criteria are the most important for making an adequate decision."

Tailor your clothing.,
Wear monochromatic outfits.,
Cover your legs with dark colors.,
Add vertical stripes to your wardrobe.,
Choose jackets that are a little on the short side.,
Wear skirts and dresses with the right cuts.,
Look for high-waisted pants and skirts.,
Tuck your shirt in.,
Avoid low-rise jeans or pants.",How to Make Your Legs Look Longer2," A streamlined silhouette will make you look taller overall, lengthening the appearance of your legs. Clothes that fit poorly can bulk up your silhouette, making you look shorter. Meanwhile, well-fitted clothes will look sleeker. If you can't find clothes that fit perfectly off the rack, bring your garments to a tailor or learn how to alter hems at home., Try creating outfits made up mostly or entirely out of a single color. When your clothing is all one color, it can be harder for someone to tell where your legs start and end.


While all colors work for the leg-lengthening monochromatic look, very dark colors like black will have the greatest effect., Black has a slimming effect, making your legs look longer. You don't have to go monochrome to benefit from black's leg-lengthening power. A pair of black tights or skinny jeans will go with anything., Vertical details draw the eye up and down, creating the illusion of additional length. This is why vertical stripes are well-known as a ""slimming"" pattern. Use this to your advantage by wearing pants, stockings, and skirts that feature vertical stripes.Piping, sharp creases, and vertical rows of buttons can create the same effect.

, A cropped jacket will have an overall lengthening effect when worn on a shorter frame. They will also balance out a longer torso, making the legs look longer.


While cropped jackets will make your legs appear longer, stay away from midriff-baring shirts if you have a long torso. A crop top will further elongate your trunk.Jackets with only slight taper instead of a full crop can also give the illusion of longer legs., If you're trying to balance out a longer torso, A-line skirts will make your waist appear higher and your legs longer.

Empire waists are also good for this body type, as they create the illusion of a raised waist by shifting focus up. This cut also works well for those with overall petite figures, as an empire waist can also elongate one's frame., The eye naturally assumes that your leg starts where your waist starts. By wearing high-waisted bottoms, your legs will appear to start higher on your torso. Consequently, they will look much longer than they actually are., Just like a high waist makes your legs appear longer and your torso shorter, a long shirt will do the opposite. To keep a loose blouse from making your legs look shorter, be sure to tuck it in. Pair a tucked-in shirt with a high-waisted bottom for extra leg-lengthening power., As you may guess, low-rise pants have the opposite effect of high-waisted ones: They make your legs look shorter. If you're trying to make your legs look longer, you should ditch the hip-huggers. If you don't like the high-waisted look, don't go to the opposite extreme. Instead, simply wear pants that rest at your natural waist."

Keep your hems high.,
Wear skirts with asymmetrical hemlines.,
Avoid skirts that fall at your calf.,
Consider pants that are low-hemmed and wide-legged.",How to Make Your Legs Look Longer3," A simple way to make legs look longer is to show them off. Wear shorts and short skirts often. The shorter the cut, the longer your legs will look.

, Straight, horizontal hemlines interrupt the eye as it travels down your leg. Maximize the amount of length you can get from wearing a skirt by choosing an asymmetrical hemline. An asymmetrical hemline will soften the break, allowing the eye to follow smoothly down your legs., Because calves are large muscles, they tend to be the thickest part of a person's legs. When a skirt ends at the calf, it can make even the tallest person look stumpy. Instead, stick to skirts that fall either closer to the ankles or at the knee or above., Wide pants that just graze the top of your foot will make your legs look slender in comparison while creating that long solid line that lengthens their appearance. On the other hand, shorter pants will cut the line equally short. Likewise, pants that touch the ground are a bit too long and will make you seem shorter."
"
Exfoliate your legs with a scrub or body wash. Just like many people contour their faces with makeup, others use contouring to make their legs look longer and more shapely.,
Moisturize your legs.,
Apply self-tanner over your legs.,
Use an ""instant glow"" moisturizer or shimmer lotion for highlights.",How to Make Your Legs Look Longer4," Before you begin contouring, you will need a smooth canvas to work from. An exfoliating scrub will remove dead skin cells, leaving you with smooth, clean, blemish-free legs., Smooth some of your favorite lotion onto your legs. Moisturized legs will be much easier to work with than dry dusty ones. The smooth, satiny finish will also catch natural highlights better, creating a lengthening effect of its own., Follow the directions on the bottle of your self-tanner of choice. Spread only a thin layer over your legs, focusing on areas near muscles and joints. Use an applicator mitt to perform this step in order to get an even finish and reduce staining your hands.


For a less permanent contour, you can use bronzer or a slightly darker foundation instead of self-tanner. When using this type of makeup, be sure to blend it into your skin well with your fingers using small circular motions., Select a second moisturizer containing a lightening shimmer. Apply it to where light would naturally hit your legs: along the shins, down the center of your thighs, and around your calf muscles."

Measure hand length for large hands.,
Hold your hand up in the air as though you were about to wave.,
Measure from the top of your middle finger to the base of your palm.",How to Measure Hand Size2," If your hands are especially large or long, you may need to use the hand length instead of the hand circumference to find the right glove size. Most gloves are made for hands that are relatively even in length and width. Thus, if your hands are significantly longer than the average hands, you may only fit into the largest glove sizes even if your palms are not especially thick.

, Point your fingertips toward the ceiling.

, The base of your palm is the meaty part where your hand meets your wrist. Write down the measurement. If the length of your hand is longer than the circumference, use this size in inches over the hand circumference. The number of inches corresponds to the size of the glove.If you are measuring your fit for a baseball glove, measure from the tip of your index finger down to your wrist. This number, in inches, corresponds to the listed size of the glove.If you are measuring for tennis racquet grip size, measure from the tip of your ring finger down to the lowest lateral crease of your palm. This is where your palm folds along the thumb-line."

Consider measuring your hand span.,
Place a ruler on a flat surface.,
Flex your hand.,
Place the left side of your dominant hand at the zero point of the ruler.,
Record your hand span.",How to Measure Hand Size3," This number is typically used as a gauge of natural advantage for sports that involve catching, throwing, tackling, or gripping – notably, for quarterbacks in American football. Hand span is also used to choose the correct size of cello, violin.


If your finger span is six inches or wider, then you should buy a full-sized 4/4 cello. If your span is 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm), choose a 3/4 cello; if 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm), pick a 1/2 cello; if 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm), a 1/4.Bear in mind that height, arm length, age, skill level, and other indices may also be used to decide between cello sizes.
Sports camps and sports statistics analyzers use hand span as a handy heuristic. If you are trying to make a name for yourself in competitive football or basketball, you may be asked to report your hand span.

, Tape it to a table if the surface is slick. Make sure that you can comfortably stretch your hand across the space.

, Hold out your dominant hand, and stretch the fingers as wide as possible. Focus on your thumb and pinkie finger, each pulling at your palm.

, The measurement can be taken from your left or right hand, so this can be either your pinkie finger or your thumb. Lay your hand palm-down. Your middle finger should run perpendicular to the ruler., Measure the point at which the right side of your hand falls on the ruler. You should be able to see the ""span"" or width of your hand, measured across the thickest point from left to right. For your grip width, measure from the tip of your thumb to the tip of your outstretched little finger."

The mixture will melt more quickly if you use beeswax pellets rather than a block of beeswax.
Stir the mixture periodically as it’s melting to ensure that the coconut oil and beeswax combine completely.

, Once the coconut oil and beeswax have melted, remove the pan from the heat. Stir the mixture again so it’s smooth. Next, stir in ⅛ cup (30 ml) of olive oil and whisk the ingredients until they are creamy but you can still pour them.


If you want to give your “Vaseline” a pleasant scent, you can whisk in two to three drops of tea tree, peppermint, or another essential oil.

, When you’ve finished whisking the “Vaseline” mixture, carefully pour it into a glass jar or container with a lid. Let the “Vaseline” cool for two to three hours so it has time to solidify before you start using it.


The homemade “Vaseline” will stay fresh at room temperature for up to a year.

By prioritizing the project, you can get the key decisions made and executed quickly., You should always assign clear and realistic due dates at meetings. All too often, vague due dates are set for important action items and related decisions.

In this way, you can get some perspective on how the important decision could impact your short, near and long term future., Although you may feel you have a good grasp of the problem you are trying to solve with your decision, it can really pay off to describe it in more depth. You will benefit from describing the underlying problem or situation to a friend. You could also write it down in your journal. At the end of the day, it is a lot easier to make a decision that solves a well-defined as opposed to a poorly understood problem.For example, if you are trying to decide whether to quit your job, try writing down your reasons for wanting to quit. If the problem is that you like your vocation but not your boss, this understanding of the problem can help inform your decision-making. In this case, you may want to find a job that allows you to do the same thing but with a better boss.

, If you feel stuck between two choices that both feel inadequate in terms of meeting your goals, you may want to generate a list of alternatives. Give yourself five minutes to brainstorm a list of alternative solutions to your problem., You may want to consider what your life or career will look like if you choose a particular path. Go through all of the alternatives you have considered for your important decision and think about the future consequences.For instance, you could think about how much money you would make or what opportunities the choice could open up for you.

, Although it may seem obvious, you may want to figure out the priorities that you want to honor at the end of the day. You may want to honor a goal of making more money or living in a particular place, which could help you come to a decision.For instance, money, balance between life and work, location and recognition are a few of the things people commonly want to achieve through career transitions.
If you are trying to decide between staying in your current position or pursuing a new job opportunity, consider what you want to achieve at the end of the day. Once you have determined your underlying goal, such as money or location, you will be better equipped to make a decision.

, Important decisions often involve some tradeoffs, such as between making more money and living in a desirable location. If you feel like you are comparing apples and oranges, you may want to revisit your objectives and related priorities. After looking at your main objectives and the priorities you want to honor, the decision may be a little easier to make., On a blank piece of paper, make a column for “pros” and a column for “cons” of a particular choice. Take a few minutes to write down all of the possible “pros” and “cons” of a particular decision. Look at your list and see which column is the longest. This process should help you come to an appropriate decision.If you don’t have time to make a list, you can visualize a pros and cons list.

, Chat with a close friend or colleague about the decision. Explain your strategic goals and criteria for making the decision. Ask for their opinion on what you should do. By talking through the decision and explaining your overall goals, you should be able to get some worthwhile perspectives on the issue."

If your cleanser is too harsh, it will be stripping your skin of its natural oils, and therefore drying out the skin and causing it to age more quickly. Look for ones that are aimed at your age group, or ones that describe themselves as gentle or moisturizing. Women should moisturize their faces any time before they wear make-up.It is still important to cleanse your face as you get older, as it removes traces of chemicals from your environment or any make up which can cause aging if left on the skin.;
, It's important to give your skin a moisture boost so that it can look after itself. Dry skin ages more quickly if it's not moisturized. Look for anti-aging moisturizers with a high percentage of their active ingredient. If in doubt about which to buy (there are hundreds on the market), try looking at reviews or try to find scientific research supporting the product. Make sure that the product you decide on is rich and deeply moisturizing, unlike the ones you may have used in your younger years.


And remember, moisturizing is not just for women, there are plenty of similar products on the market aimed at men.

, There are many moisturizers which already contain SPF protection in them, and this is because it is vital to protect your skin from harmful UV rays every day in order to avoid sun-damage. The sun is one of the main things that causes premature aging, so dermatologists recommend that you should wear at least SPF 15 daily to avoid wrinkles, brown spots and a dull complexion. As well as this, it will protect you from skin cancer.You can put sun screen not just on your face, but on your chest and the tops of your hands, if you're just going to be out in the sun for a little while. This will prevent those spots on your chest and hands. If you're going to really be out in the sun, though, then you'll need to put sunscreen all over your body.

, Gently exfoliating encourages skin cell renewal, therefore encouraging younger looking skin. Choose something that is aimed at older skin as they are more gentle and less likely to dry out or damage the skin. Exfoliation is also good to do as it leaves your skin feeling softer and looking brighter. For men, exfoliating before shaving your face can make the shaving process easier as it exposes more of the hair.

, For men, this will make you look better groomed and less scruffy allowing you to look good with age, and for women this will hide this side effect of aging. Here are some things to keep in mind for each gender:



Men: Keep your face clean shaven or neatly trimmed, and always trim your nose and ear hair. You can buy nose hair trimmers at your local pharmacy and it’s completely simple and painless to use. Letting this hair grow wild adds age and also makes you look more scruffy. Make sure to pluck those nose hairs too, if you want to avoid that old man look.

Women: Facial hair can sometimes appear in women after the menopause due to a change in hormone levels. To get rid of this, and therefore hide your age a little better, there are a few easy ways to keep it away including laser removal, waxing, depilatory/hair removal cream and threading.

Women should also make sure to keep their eyebrows looking pretty thick. As you get older, your eyebrows may start to thin out, so make sure to color them in with a pencil that matches the color of your eyebrows so you continue to look youthful.



, There are dozens of make-up tricks that can help women make their features continue to stand out as well as to hide the signs of aging. The trick is to hide those blemishes while emphasizing your best features, such as your eyes. Here are some tricks to try:


Make sure you use a creamy concealer. Any concealer that is waxy or that can get cakey can actually make you look older.Put a dab of blush at the height of your cheekbones, but don't use blush in the hollows of your cheeks. As you get older, your face will actually lose fat, and your cheeks will naturally get a little hollower. This can make you look a bit older, so there's no need to emphasize this further with too much blush.Start using brown eyeliner instead of black. As you get older, black will start to look too stark in contrast to the rest of your face. Brown will create more gentle frames around your eyes.
Show off your lashes. As you get older, your lashes will naturally get thinner and will straighten out, so counteract that by curling your lashes or even wearing thickening mascara when you can.
Minimize the drama around your lips. A nice pale shade of lipstick can be a great addition to your face, but don't line your lips too much or wear bright lipstick; your lips will thin out as you get older, and there's no need to overcompensate.

, Good teeth can immediately make you look younger and more attractive. Make sure you have a good tooth-care routine, this should include brushing, flossing and using mouth wash. If your teeth aren't white enough, or if you have problems with your teeth, go to your dentist for advice. You could have professional whitening, or if you have problems such as decay, wonky teeth or stained teeth you could get these things treated.


There are also over the counter whitening products which can also be effective, although you might want to talk to your dentist for advice beforehand.
Teeth can give away your real age more than any other part of your body, so start early with your total teeth care routine.

, This isn't for everyone, as some people love to rock their grey or peppery hair. However, many people want to get rid of grey hair, and there are many hair dyes on the market that can tackle it. It's best to choose a color that is fairly similar to what your natural hair color was so that it appears more natural. You could choose to get your hair dyed at a salon, or you could choose the cheaper option and buy an at-home hair dying kit. You must remember, however, that all hair dye is damaging to the hair, so avoid dying it too often, and use products designed to care for damaged or dyed hair.


As a way of avoiding dying your hair too often, you can apply hair dye primarily to the roots where your real hair color is showing, leave it there for longer, and then work the rest through the hair for the last few minutes. Another alternative is to buy root touch-up kits that match the hair dye you used.
Women should consider getting highlights along with dying their hair, to add a softer edge to their new look.
Try using natural or organic hair dyes free from harmful chemicals. You will have better hair and it will be better.

, Have you been rocking ""The Rachel"" for the last twenty years? If so, then you're overdue for a trendier haircut that can make the most of your youthful face and features. Check out some stylish magazines or even some celebrity gossip magazines and see what hairstyles are popular these days. You don't have to go for something ultra-trendy if that's not your thing, but getting a haircut that suits you better than your old one can make you look a decade younger. Here are some things to consider when you go for a new haircut:Women:

Consider getting bangs if you have a larger forehead and if they fit your face shape. They will make you look more youthful.
Layers can also take years off the age you look. They'll make your hair look more textured, airy, and voluminous, and will get rid of that flat, stringy look your hair might be suffering from.
Chop off your hair so it frames your face and falls above your shoulders. Cutting a few inches off your hair will make you look years younger. Just make sure you don't cut it too short so you end up looking like you're rocking the Grandma look.



Men:

Let your hair grow out just a bit so your features look less harsh. But don't let your hair get too shaggy or you'll look a bit more haggard and old.
If you're going bald, consider shaving your head. This will make you look younger -- and sexier -- instead of just letting your bald spot show.



, Wearing clothes that flatter your figure can make you instantly look slimmer and more trendy, without having to try too hard. This applies to men as well, although men's' body shapes have less variety than women's body shapes. You won't look any younger if you dress like a person half your age; in fact, this may make you look even older. Instead, focus on clothing that is right for you.


Women don't need to show additional cleavage to look younger; instead, wear flattering shirts that emphasize your best features without calling too much attention to your chest.
If you've been wearing the same things for the past decade, it’s time to update your wardrobe. If you don't know what to buy, try asking a friend or family member with good style to go to some shops with you, or if you are uncomfortable doing this, have a look in magazines and see what kinds of things you like on models in there and see how you can apply it to yourself.
If you are still unsure, either go to a shop and ask a sales assistant for advice, or just go and pick up all the items of clothing you like the look of, even if you think they might not suit you, take them to the changing rooms and have fun trying new things. Eventually you'll be pleasantly surprised with something and will have something new and fresh.

, Bright colors will make you look more youthful, fun, and vibrant. Wearing vibrant colors will also make you feel more youthful and energetic. Get rid of all of those black, gray, and neutral-toned clothes and spice up your wardrobe with some red, orange, green, and other festive colors. Though black and darker colors may be slimming, they also make you look a bit older than you really are.


You don't have to get rid of your darker colored clothes completely. But if you do wear a black shirt, for example, spice it up with a colorful tie or a bright piece of jewelry.

, Women should put away those matching necklace and earring sets that make them look dignified, but a bit older, in favor of trendier jewelry. You'll look a lot younger if you have cute, stylish earrings instead of wearing that matching pear earring and necklace set you love so much. Women who wear colorful rings are also said to look younger, because the rings add some spice to their outfit.


Additionally, it helps to get manicures and pedicures regularly. This extra hand maintenance will make you look even younger.

, Studies show that wearing pink-grapefruit scented perfume -- or even lotion -- makes women give off a younger vibe than any other scent. Don't overdo it, of course, but just a dab behind the ears can work wonders.

, Drink at least 10 8 oz. glasses of water and you will help keep your skin moist and will continue to look as fresh and young as can be. Hydrating will keep your insides healthy and will make you not only feel better, but look healthy on the outside. Make drinking water a regular part of your daily routine. Don't just drink it with meals, but make sure to have a glass every hour or two, even if you're not feeling particularly thirsty.You don't have to over-hydrate, but make a point of drinking enough water to stay healthy and look young.

, This can be difficult, some people are too busy, unsure of what to do or think they are too unfit to start exercise. However, even small but regular amounts of exercise will help to keep you energetic and lively, which won't only keep you looking young, but will keep you feeling young too! Combine this with a healthy, well balanced diet and you'll be in better health for longer, have more energy and prevent illnesses which can add years onto your appearance.Make a goal of exercising for at least 30 minutes a day.
If it's really hard to work exercising into your daily routine, aim to walk as much as you can. Walk to the grocery store for 20 minutes instead of driving, walk when you're chatting on the phone with your friends, or just try to walk for at least two hours a week.
Though staying in shape is important, losing weight drastically or yo-yo dieting may make you suddenly lose a lot of weight, but it can actually make you look older. Losing weight quickly can make your facial and neck skin look a bit saggy, so it's better to take things in moderation and lose weight gradually. Low-carb, high-fat diets can actually assist with weight loss.Some great exercises for older people include yoga, Pilates, biking, easy hiking, and tennis.

, Though there is no one magical food that will take ten years off your face, there are some foods you can eat regularly that can make you look and feel more youthful. Here are some foods that you should incorporate into your diet if you haven't already:Oranges. The vitamin C in this delicious fruit is guaranteed to make you feel younger.
Broccoli. This vegetable has vitamin C and properties that help keep your liver strong.
Low-fat yogurt. It can help your skin and give you the calcium you need for healthy teeth.
Berries. The antioxidants in any kind of berry can help keep your skin fresh.
Sweet potatoes. These are great for your complexion and hair.
Carrots. These are another fantastic food for your skin.

, It is a water-soluble vitamin that is an antioxidant. This means that it protects your cells from damage that is caused by free radicals. Vitamin C is known to help the skin heal, protect from the sun's harmful UV rays, and support the rest of the body (not only the skin) in other ways. Don't take more than 2000 mg per day as it can increase your chance for kidney stones.., This fat-soluble vitamin helps keep our bones strong, prevent cancer and autoimmunity, and support healthy aging of the skin. There are receptors for Vitamin D all over your body., It's shown that these vitamins help to repair the skin and possibly prevent Alzheimer's disease., That's right. Studies show that having sex at least three times a week makes you look ten times younger than people who don't. This is because sex leads to the production of a human growth hormone that prevents aging. This doesn't mean that you should go out looking for a good shag three nights a week just to look younger, but if you have a partner that you love (or like), then make a point of getting it on a bit more.You may be telling yourself that you're too busy, tired, or just have too much on your mind to have sex. But hey, now you can think of having sex not as a fun way to pass the time, but as a means of looking younger. Now that's productive!

, Nothing will make you look older faster than slouching over like your grandmother. Having good posture will make you look much younger; all you have to do is make a conscious effort to keep your spine straight, your shoulders up instead of slouching, and your face looking ahead instead of down at the floor, and you'll instantly look ten years younger. Keeping your spine straight will also make the nerve cells in the spine fire more efficiently, giving you more energy and making you look and feel younger throughout the day.It may be tempting to slouch when you're sitting down, but remember that good posture is something you can maintain whether you're sitting down or standing up.

, You shouldn't go for 10-12 hours a sleep every night just to try to look younger. That won't work. However, you should aim to be well-rested as often as you can. As you get older, your body will begin to show signs of tiredness more and more, especially around the eyes. You may even find, as you age, that you need less sleep than you did a decade ago, and that's fine too. Try to stick to whatever magic sleep number works for you, whether it's seven hours or even a little less., Getting a massage at least once a month, whether it's done professionally or administered by a loving (or begrudging) significant other, can make you feel relaxed and ease up on some of the tension that makes your body look older. It also stimulates the secretion of anabolic hormones, which reduce aging.


Make a goal of getting a massage at least once a month, or even more frequently, if you're feeling particularly tense.

, Doing yoga is a lower-impact way of taking care of your mind and body, relieving stress, and making yourself feel more grateful for the life you're given. Take a look around the yoga studio and see how youthful and energetic all of the women are; surely going to yoga at least once or twice a week couldn't hurt how young you look. Yoga is also a great way to get exercise, heal injuries, or to work out as a beginner (if you take a class for beginners, that is.)Doing yoga also generally promotes a healthy lifestyle that will help you look younger.

, It's a fact that a stressful lifestyle will make you tired and unhappy, and will give you wrinkles. Try to reduce the number of responsibilities you have, and find new ways of coping with life's demands. Try taking at least an hour a day to chill out and do something such as relaxing in the bath with a good book, or to watch your favorite TV program. Though it's impossible to fully eliminate stress from your life, even if you live on a tropical paradise and have found a bag full of money, you can take steps to minimize the stress you're feeling.


This means avoiding situations that bring you great stress, like going to loud parties you don't even like or getting in your car during the peak of rush-hour traffic.
Make a list of the ten things that stress you out the most. Now, write down five ways that you can reduce your exposure to each thing, if you can.
Of course, there are some stressful things you can't avoid, such as an aging parent or a spouse who lost his job; however, you do have the power to develop a more positive attitude toward these things.

, If you're a smoker, make a concerted effort to quit smoking as soon as you can (easier said than done, eh?). It's one of the worst things you can do if you're trying to avoid looking old. It makes your lips thinner, your skin dryer and more wrinkly, and dull and your hair and nails discolored. As well as this, quitting will make you much more healthy and less likely to get a serious disease in the future.


Smoking obviously also makes you smell like cigarettes. This is not a smell associated with people in the first bloom of youth -- not in 2013, anyway.

, Add laughter to your life. As you age, happiness and laughter are an essential element of your well-being. Surrounded by good friends with funny stories keeps you young and vibrant. Don't worry about giving yourself wrinkles from laughing too much -- just laugh your heart out. Be around people who make you laugh and feel ten years younger, and you will begin to look it.

, The side effects of alcohol drinking are less widely known than the effects of smoking, but it is just as harmful. Alcohol can cause premature aging as well as being linked with disease later in life. Alcohol also dehydrates you, which will make your skin look more dry. Alcohol can also create puffiness around your eyes the day after you drink it, and that does not create a youthful effect, either.


Of course, part of looking young is feeling young and having fun. And for some people, alcohol is a fun social lubricant. So, if you like to get crazy and have a few martinis now and again, don't cut the drinking out of your life completely.

, Seriously. Part of looking young is having a fun, carefree attitude. This doesn't mean that you should be immature, dance on tables, or make fun of people like you're in the sixth grade. It does mean that you should be positive, friendly, and avoid jealousy, resentment, or any other feelings that make you feel like you're turning into an old lady.Stop worrying as much as you can and go out there and enjoy the world. You'll be too busy having fun to worry about how you look.
Be proud of your age. Stay positive about how you look, even if you wish you could look a little younger, and other people will see your looks in a more positive light.

Understand how gout affects the body.,
Completely avoid certain high-purine animal products.,
Limit your consumption of all meat and fish.,
Avoid vegetables, fruits and legumes high in uric acid.,
Eat less fat.,
Avoid high-fructose corn syrup.,
Keep your weight down.,
Keep your stress in check.,
Cut back on alcohol, especially beer.,
Drink lots of water.,
Assess your vitamin and pain medication intake.,
Ease the pain of flare-ups with pain relievers.,
Get treated for underlying causes.,
Look into new therapies for gout.",How to Lower Uric Acid to Get Rid of Gout," A gout attack occurs when uric acid levels get too high, leading to the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints and other areas. Increased levels of uric acid can lead to a number of painful issues throughout the body.


Since these crystals are heavier than the blood carrying them, they begin to create deposits throughout the body. However, due to gravity, these heavy crystals are usually pulled to the lower part of the body, including the large space between the joints in the big toe.
Kidney stones happen when uric acid crystals form in the kidneys.
Crystal formations called tophi can form under the skin.;
, Certain meats, fish and other animal products contain high amounts of purine, which converts to uric acid. When too much uric acid builds up in the joints, it leads to gout.Completely avoiding the following high-purine foods will help ease the impact of your gout:


Organ meats
Herring
Anchovies
Mackerel

, All meat, fish and poultry has some amount of uric acid. While you don't have to become a strict vegetarian, cutting back on meat and fish is an essential step to treating the disease.Limit your consumption of the following foods to 4 to 6 ounces (1 serving) daily:


Poultry
Red meat (pork, beef and lamb)
Tuna
Lobster
Shrimp

, Some non-meat products are also naturally high in purines. These foods tend to contribute to the formation of uric acid in the blood. The following vegetables, fruits and legumes have high uric acid:


Mushrooms
Beans
Peas
Lentils
Bananas
Avocado
Kiwi fruit
Pineapple

, Eating a lot of saturated fat has been shown to inhibit the body's ability to process uric acid. Avoid fried foods and foods with a high fat content, like full-fat dairy. Low-fat foods like fruits and vegetables, legumes, and whole grains will help you manage gout.

, Fructose increases uric acid, so avoid beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup as well as desserts and other items that contain this substance.It's important to read food packages carefully, because HFCS is present in a lot of different foods, even those that don't necessarily taste sweet, like bread or snack foods.

, People who are overweight or obese are at greater risk for developing gout. Losing weight can help keep gout in check and move you closer toward getting rid of it for good. Talk with your doctor about constructing a healthy weight-loss plan that involves limiting foods high in purine. It should be constructed around the following foods, in addition to plenty of exercise:


Lean protein options (excluding organ meat and fatty fish)
Whole grains
Low-purine fruits and vegetables
Nuts and other healthy snacks

, A high stress level can lead to gout flare-ups, so it's important to take measures to keep your stress under control. Exercising and eating well can be a big help. In addition to keeping your body healthy, work on achieving sound mental health by doing the following:


Take time to yourself as often as necessarily. If you're feeling pulled in a million directions, that'll take a toll on your body.
Meditate, do yoga, or spend some time outside. Start regularly performing an activity that brings you inner peace.
Get plenty of sleep every night. Aim for 7-8 hours, and try to stick to a schedule.

, Beer is known to increase uric acid, and it should be completely avoided to combat gout. Wine, however, shouldn't increase uric acid if it's consumed in small quantities. Drinking just one or two 5-ounce servings a day does not increase your risk.

, It helps to flush uric acid from the system, relieving your joints of buildup. Drink more than you normally would - at least 8 to 16 8-ounce glasses every day., People who take a lot of vitamins containing niacin as well as some over-the-counter medicines are at an increased risk of developing gout. If you tend to take a lot of vitamins and medicines, meet with your doctor to discuss how they might be affecting your gout.The following supplements and medicines may put you at risk of having flare-ups:


Niacin
Aspirin
Diuretics
Cyclosporine
Levodopa

, Gout is one of the most painful types of arthritis, and when flareups happen, medication can be a big help. It's important to talk with your doctor about a medication plan that will be healthy for your body. Your doctor may present the following options, depending on your pain level:


Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These are available over-the-counter.
Corticosteroids, such as prednisone.
Colchicine. This medicine works best when taken within the first 12 hours of an acute attack.

, Gout isn't always a result of eating too much meat and other purine-heavy foods. Sometimes it's a result of the body's inability to get rid of uric acid for other reasons. If you've been affected by one of the following issues, you'll need to get proper treatment to keep your gout in check:Some people with gout have an enzyme defect that makes it very difficult for the body to break down purines.
Some people have gout as a result of being exposed to lead in the environment.
People who have had an organ transplant are particularly susceptible.

, Since gout is on the rise, new therapies and medications are always being tested.If gout is affecting your quality of life and conventional ways of treating it aren't working, talk with your doctor about exploring all of your options.

Reflect on people that made an impression on you.,
Consider what you bring to the table.,
See things from other peoples' perspectives.,
Decide what your goal is.,
Dress to suit your environment.As you might imagine, there's no single outfit that will leave a great impression on everyone.,
Be well rested.,
Give yourself a makeover.,
Exercise regularly.,
Be punctual.Whether you're meeting someone for business or pleasure, there's no quicker way to ruin someone's impression of you than to be late.,
Use assertive body language.,
Be a good listener.Considering you're the one who's wanting to make the big impression, it may seem counter-intuitive to quiet down and let the other person take the reins for a while.,
Speak well.The art of oration isn't one that can be learned overnight.",How to Make a Good Impression," Following the example of others works in many cases when it comes to self-improvement. There are no doubt at least a few people you've crossed paths with that left a heft impression on you, whether through their talents, charms or unique qualities.Think about what made these people so likeable and memorable. Do you see any of their traits in yourself? Whether you do or don't, these examples are a good model to start with.;
, Everyone is different, and everyone has something unique to offer. If you can pinpoint what makes you special, highlighting those best traits of yourself in your behaviour will make you stand out in peoples' minds. Are you funny, smart, charming, fashionable? Knowing where you stand realistically and knowing how to emphasize those best traits will make you more memorable in the eyes of others.


The most memorable people are usually only remembered for one or two things. Only closer friends will have time to see you for who you really are. If you're intent on making a big impression with someone, you should focus on emphasizing one or two of your boldest qualities.

, If you try to look at a situation through someone else's eyes, you'll be that much closer towards knowing exactly how to act and leave a good impression on them. This is especially helpful if you already know the person you'd like to impress. By knowing them, you'll be able to tap into their train of thought more easily.


Even if you don't know the person personally, any fact you know about someone can help in predicting what they'll look for in you. For instance, most prospective employers will be looking for a lot of the same things: punctuality, politeness and professionalism., Why do you want to make a good impression? Asking for a specific reason why may seem like an unnecessary question, but taking the time to consider the reasons why will help you decide how you'd like to be memorable. If you want to make a good impression on someone you're not planning on having a close friendship with, you can rely purely on surface charm. A more enduring connection (like a new romantic partner) may be worth letting see your true colours.


There's nothing wrong with putting on a mask for other people, just as there's nothing wrong with truly being yourself. It all depends on the intent you have in mind.

, A nice dress may seem perfect for an evening gala, but it wouldn't be received nearly as well on a subway or at a doom metal concert. If you know the sort of environment you're expected to be in, you should have at least a vague idea of what you'll be expected to wear. Dress to impress.If you don't know what kind of clothing or formality you should be going for, it's always best to air on the side of caution and take the dressier route. People may look at you funny for dressing up to a casual event, but it's not nearly as bad as the looks you'll get for going casual to a formal event. What's more; if your clothing stands out enough, you'll risk taking a hit to your self-confidence in the situation.

, Getting enough sleep should be a given, but you may be surprised how many people try to forego this essential step. If you're running on less than 6 hours of sleep, you cannot hope to be at your best.A lack of sleep will result in mental cloudiness and irritability.


If you need to make a good impression, refrain from any afternoon or evening caffeine the night before. Doing so will make it harder to fall asleep, and make it nearly impossible if you're worried about your performance the next day.
Melatonin is a great natural supplement that helps ease you into sleep. Take it 20 minutes before you would like to fall asleep., Everyone can do with a good makeover. When it comes to leaving a good impression, changing up your look forces people to reconsider your appearance. This is great if you're trying to get a second chance at making an impression. It doesn't have to be too drastic to get people looking your way in a new light. Women might try applying a different technique of makeup, or a new hairstyle. Men could try changing up their outfit, or trying a different style of facial hair.


It should be noted that those who give themselves makeovers tend to enjoy boosted self-confidence. After all, walking around with a bold new look proves to yourself that you're daring, and more than worth someone's attention.

, On top of improving the look and function of your body, moderate to rigorous exercise encourages endorphins in your brain, which in turn improves mood and reduces mental fogginess. All of these things play a big role in making a good impression on people.If you want to maximize the impression you'll make later on in the day, wake up with a glass of fresh water and go for a long run. It will increase your potential throughout the rest of your day.

, Instead, you should try to get wherever you need to be a few minutes early. Not only will this prove to the other person that you're a go-getter, you'll also alleviate stress on yourself. This will ensure you're as clear-headed as can be for the interactions ahead.

, Using positive, confident body language can demonstrate to everyone around you that you have confidence in yourself and your abilities without ever needing to open your mouth. Demonstrating assertive body language has a bonus effect of actually making you feel more confident as a result, even if you're only faking it at first. Try practicing in the mirror if it doesn't already come naturally to you. It may be tricky at first, but it does come with time.


Eye contact is a powerful technique in body language, and for good reason. Making eye contact shows confidence.A firm handshake is crucial, particularly in business settings.As always, solid posture will show everyone that you respect yourself.

, All the same, people tend to be more impressed by someone who demonstrates a sincere, vivid interest in themselves and what they do.Demonstrate effective listening skills: reiterate what the other person is saying to you, ask questions, and don't interrupt until there's a natural break in the conversation.

, All the same, knowing how to speak well and confidently can sometimes leave an impression all on its own. No matter whether you're on a date or at a board meeting, speak in such a way where none of your words are rushed. Speak with slightly greater volume than you'd normally be comfortable with. Breaking out of your comfort zone in ways like this will set you apart from the crowd no matter where you are.


Don't forget to use the person's name whenever it feels natural. People love hearing someone say their name, and the same can be advised if you're trying to make them remember you.

Dress for your body type.",How to Look Skinny1," Be sure that you are wearing the best clothing for the shape of your body. Everyone is shaped differently. This is normal. To look your best, you should be sure to dress in a way that flatters your natural shape.This will make you look naturally thinner. Whatever your shape, remember to wear clothing that fits. Oversize and baggy clothing will make you appear to be fuller figured, regardless of shape.


Circle: This is when you tend to gain weight around your stomach but not so much elsewhere. With a body type like this, it is best to accentuate the chest and limbs while hiding the stomach. Wear clothing that is loose-fitting around your stomach but tight-fitting elsewhere. An example of this would be be an empire waist shirt paired with skinny jeans.
Rectangle: This is when you have hips, waist, and shoulders that are roughly the same width. With this body type, you will want to create the impression of curves. This will make your waist seem smaller. Wear clothing that fits closely at your waist but flares at the bottom. An example outfit would include a fitted top with a belt and circle skirt.
Triangle: This body type is when you have broad shoulders but narrow hips. While this body type tends to look naturally slim, you may still wish to wear clothing which gives the appearance of hips. This will make your shoulders look narrower. Avoid shirts with puffed shoulders and wear skirts which flare or are full.
Hourglass: This body type includes a narrow waist but wide hips and large bust. With this body type, it is best to emphasize your waist and keep your upper and lower body proportional. Form-fitting tops with skinny jeans or a skirt look good on this body type and belts are key to emphasizing your small waist.
Pear: This is when you have a small waist and chest but large hips. With this body type, it is best to draw attention and add volume to the upper half of your body and de-emphasize the lower half. This will create a more balanced look which will draw focus to your small waist. An example outfit would include a jacket with a structured shoulder and pants with a straight leg and no pockets.;

Understand that glitz pageants are controversial.",How to Win a Child Glitz Pageant," Visit the pageant’s website and get a copy of the guidelines and judging criteria. Review what is and isn’t allowed for the pageant you’re entering. You should know this before planning outfits and styling.For example, some pageants don’t allow flippers or wigs, whereas some expect them.
Find out how many different performances each child will make so that you know how many outfits and routines to plan for.;
, Use a glitz pageant photographer. Prepare your child’s outfit, hair and makeup before taking the photos. These photographers edit and enhance headshots with special software in keeping with glitz pageant expectations.


Read reviews online to find a good photographer. Ask to see examples of their work before deciding on the right photographer for you.
Send the headshots to the pageant organizers as per the rules of the pageant.

, Look for a pageant coach who is familiar with child glitz pageantry. Expect to pay about $100 an hour for lessons from an experienced coach. Ask the coach for advice on a stage walk, cute poses, and all-around styling.You may also want to enroll your child in specific talent classes, such as voice or dance lessons.

, Use your creativity to come up with props, and make sure they are allowed at the pageant. You may want to incorporate backdrop pieces into the routine. Make the prop(s) relevant to the song or routine.


For example, if the routine is about a fairy tale, you may want a large cardboard castle or a fake carriage.
Pageants may ban props that can affect the stage or audience, such as bubble machines or live animals.

, Come up with music, dances, and poses for each performance. Have your child practice about an hour a day, beginning a month before the pageant.Don’t pressure your child to practice, or the idea of the pageant can become a chore instead of a fun pastime.
Consider making a practice chart with stickers and potential rewards for practicing, to encourage preparation in a positive way.

, Begin looking for outfits as early as six months before a pageant. Choose outfits with color and style that compliment your child. Make sure that the outfits are age-appropriate. Have your child try on the outfits ahead of time to ensure they aren’t too long, short, tight or loose.Consider which colors look best with your child’s eyes, hair color and skin tone.
For example, dresses and gowns should be sweet and cute, not sexy or revealing.
Girls under ten wear cupcake dresses with ruffles and lots of shiny stones. Girls over ten wear long ball gowns. Boys wear suits or tuxedos.
Shop online or visit a prom or pageant dress shop. Expect that you will probably need to have alterations made, which can take weeks.

, Visit a dentist or orthodontist who can make a flipper for your child. Have your child try the flipper on ahead of time in case it needs to be adjusted. Keep the flipper well cleaned, and don’t allow your child to eat or sleep with it on.A flipper is made of acrylic resin and costs about $300 to $500 for a full set. Alternately, you can purchase just a top or bottom flipper for half the cost.You may want a flipper if your child has missing, damaged or very crooked teeth.

, Purchase false lashes and hairpieces, if desired. Look for a hairpiece with real hair, as synthetic hairpieces tend to look fake. Have your child try on the hairpiece beforehand to make sure its shade blends well with their natural hair color. Hire your own hair and makeup artist, or make plans to utilize one who is working for the pageant.


Keep in mind that makeup and hair professionals working for the pageant are on a tight schedule and may have issues getting everyone prepared on time. If you want to avoid that stress, bring your own artist who is informed about glitz pageant makeup and hairstyles., Get your child’s nails done before the pageant, if desired. For glitz pageants, contestants usually get a spray tan as well. Alternately, you can do your child’s nails and tan yourself.

, Book a room in the hotel where the pageant is being held. Even if you live nearby, it’s a good idea to have a room where your child can prepare, as well as take a nap if needed. Plan to arrive early or the night before so that you can set up your child’s stuff in the room and take your time.


Find out what the hotel’s check-in and check-out times are.

, Understand that pageant schedules are intense. Prepare to begin getting ready early in the morning and continue pageant activities until well into the afternoon. Bring water and healthy snacks like bananas.Have your child go to sleep early the night before the pageant.
Allow your child to nap during breaks if he or she is tired.

, Expect judges to give better scores to kids who are truly enjoying themselves on stage. Emphasize happiness and animation more than moves and cues.If your child messes up, don't be angry. Try saying, ""You were great! You look so nice, and I’m very proud of you.""

, Avoid making obvious gestures or statements while your child is on stage. Judges often deduct points when they notice obvious coaching, and/or a child focusing solely on a coach.


You and your child can agree upon a subtle signal to boost confidence, such as a thumbs up.

, Applaud for other contestants. Keep a positive attitude. Give other families and contestants the same respect and encouragement you would want for your child.

, Expect to pay at least $400 to $500 for a glitz pageant. You could pay over $3,500 to prepare for such a pageant. Consider entering a natural pageant or involving your child in a different activity if the cost of a glitz pageant will put you into debt.Glitz pageant entry fees alone range from $50 to $500.
Additional costs include travel expenses, outfits, styling and coaching/talent lessons.
Glitz pageant dresses are expensive and often custom-made., Don’t place unrealistic expectations on your child, such as to perform perfectly or to win the top title. Make sure that your motivation isn’t to satisfy your own need for success through your child. Focus on goals that will promote good mental health for your child. Evaluate whether you are able to instruct your child with positive, gentle encouragement.Healthy goals for children are unconditional love, play time with other kids, self-confidence, and encouraging teachers.It’s unhealthy for parents to desire financial benefits or social recognition through their child’s performance., Expect that you may encounter critics.

Use makeup.,
Get a tan.",How to Look Skinny2," Makeup can be used to create the appearance of depth or emphasize the best features of your face. For example, it can be used to create shadows under your cheekbones (making a fuller face appear slimmer) or to brighten lips (drawing attention away from a round jaw). These methods require skill and practice but can be very effective.


Be sure not to overuse makeup, as this can give you a plastic or unnatural appearance. Use foundation and cover-up only sparingly. Choose colors that are more natural in appearance, as bright colors and too much color will look clownish. Also, be sure to use colors that complement your clothing, hair, and skin.

, Get a tan to emphasize or create shadows and highlights on your body. This will make you look thinner and more fit.Where the shadows and highlights on clothing are difficult to control (which is why wearing black helps hide problem areas), you can control the shadows and highlights on your skin easily with skillful use of tanning products.


Don’t go overboard. Be careful in how you apply self-tanner to avoid streaks and be sure not to use too much. You don’t want an unnatural or orange appearance. The goal is to create shadows and highlights, which means that being an overall dark color will not help.
You may want to go to a tanning salon if you are inexperienced with tanning. Putting on self-tanner can be difficult and knowing where to put shadows and highlights takes time to learn. See how a professional does it first before trying it yourself.

Accessorize.,
Use color and pattern wisely.,
Draw attention where you want it to go.",How to Look Skinny3," Accessories are important to creating a slimmer appearance. These pieces can reduce the appearance of extra weight or give you a longer appearance which will make you look proportionally thinner. Remember that a higher quality item will generally do a better job at this than a lower quality one.


Use shape wear. Shape wear, a popular brand being Spanx, will help distribute bulges while holding you in. This will make you look significantly slimmer. When purchasing, remember that they are meant to be tight fitting. These go best under dresses and skirts but they also can be worn under pants. They also come in a variety of shapes, in order to provide support where you need it for your particular body type.
Wear a well-fit bra. Many women wear bras that are incorrectly sized. If too small, this can create bulges which make you appear fuller figured. If wearing a bra that is too large, this will create a drooping chest which can lead your waist to appear wider. An appropriately fit bra will make you look slimmer and also be more comfortable. Stores such as Macy’s or Victoria’s Secret will do fittings for free, over your clothes or in the privacy of a fitting room.
Wear heels. Heeled shoes will make your legs, and your body as a whole, appear longer. This longer appearance will make your body appear proportionally thinner. Heels also lead many women to have better posture, as well as tucking in the hips to create a rounder bottom. Brightly colored shoes can also draw attention to slim legs and away from a fuller belly.
Wear appropriate jewelry. Long-chained necklaces can create the appearance of length, which will make you appear slimmer in much the same way as wearing heels. Avoid big or wide earrings if you have a wide or full face, as this will lead your face to look fuller.
Wear a belt. If you have a waist which is smaller than the other areas of your body, it is a good idea to emphasize it as this will lead you to appear slimmer overall. Belts are a great way to emphasize your waist. They can be wide or thin, depending on what is best for your outfit.

, The colors and patterns on our clothes play a big part in how others perceive our bodies. You can use how the human eye works to create a slimmer appearance by choosing colors and patterns that are right for your body type.


Wear black. When you wear black, you reduce the ability for others to see shadows on your clothing. Seeing shadows is how our eyes perceive depth, so in doing this you will reduce the appearance of bulges and create a slimmer silhouette. Be careful not to overuse black, however as this can create a depressing appearance.
Wear bright colors. You can use bright colors to emphasize the thinner sections of your body while drawing attention away from fuller sections. A brightly colored belt can emphasize a small waist or a brightly colored top can draw attention away from full hips.
Choose stripes wisely. Stripes can create a thinner or fuller appearance, depending on their direction. Vertical stripes create the appearance of length, whereas horizontal stripes create the appearance of width. Avoid horizontal stripes in areas you want to appear slimmer. Instead, use them strategically to create balance, such as to make narrow hips appear wider (in turn narrowing the appearance of your waist). Use vertical stripes on items like pants, leggings or tights to make your legs look long and lean.
Choose polka dots and other patterns wisely. Patterns can be fun and flirty but they must be chosen carefully. Busy patterns such as polka dots draw attention, so use them only in areas you want to emphasize. Larger patterns also create a fuller appearance, so use smaller prints in areas you want to appear thinner.

, As discussed in the section on body shapes, attention should be drawn to your best features. You can use a variety of methods to direct the eye where you want it to go, including the use of color and pattern, makeup, hairstyle and shoes.


Use bright colors and bold patterns. As discussed above, colors and patterns can draw the attention of those around you. Use this to emphasize your best features, such as a small waist, great legs or a full bust. A bright belt can draw attention to a small waist. A close-fitting, patterned top can draw attention to a well-portioned upper body. Brightly colored high heels can show off great legs. Make sure to carefully choose colors and patterns that are right for your body. Colors should be chosen to compliment the natural colors of your skin, eyes and hair, as well as express personal style.
Carefully choose your hairstyle. Your hair will significantly change how your face appears, so be sure to choose a style which emphasizes your best features. Avoid blunt bangs, as the horizontal line makes your face wider. Also, avoid chin-length styles as this will draw attention to a double chin. Do use side sweeping bangs and long layers, as these both create a slimmer appearance by drawing the eye away from the width of your face.

Get healthy.,
Never starve yourself.,
Consult an expert.",How to Look Skinny4," You may wish to achieve a slimmer look by losing weight. Make sure that this is what is best for you and only undertake the task if it is something you want for yourself. Losing weight and getting healthy is a long, challenging process and should only be done to make you feel better, not everyone else. Your happiness matters most!


Eat right. You hear it all the time in regards to losing weight but it’s true: eating healthy is the best way to lose weight. Calories are really just your body’s way of getting and storing energy, so make sure that you don’t get too many. Most people consume too many calories for the amount of energy they exert because the food they eat has too many things their body doesn't need and too little of the things is does need. When you don’t get enough nutrients, you feel tired and hungry because your body doesn't have the fuel it needs. Eating healthy, well-balanced meals will make you feel less hungry and give your body what it needs to get through the day. Avoid foods that have little nutrients, like chips, candy and soda. These are empty calories that do nothing for your body and serve only to increase your weight.
Exercise. It’s not always fun, especially when you’re out of shape, but exercise will go a long way to getting you healthy. It helps to ensure that the amount of calories you take in is proportional to the amount of energy your body uses in a given day. It doesn't need to be complicated, either. Just doing things like walking more or taking the stairs instead of the elevator will help. Find small ways throughout your day to increase your activity level. You can do squats while waiting for food to cook and a few minutes of planks before taking a shower in the morning will go a long way.

, You need some fat on your body! It’s not just a matter of keeping you warm, either. Fat is how our body stores nutrients, which it distributes during times when we’re not eating or when we can’t eat (due to sickness or lack of food). We need to nutrients in food to keep our bodies running, so it is important not to starve yourself. Doing this will make you tired and lead you to feel sick.


Eat healthy snacks. In order to keep yourself full while still eating healthy and helping to lose weight, eat snacks throughout the day that are high in nutrients but low in bad fats. This works best if you find foods that are high in protein, as protein will give you the most energy. Fresh cut vegetables and fruit, cottage cheese, or nuts make great healthy snacks.
Starving yourself is also counterproductive. When we don’t eat for long periods of time or if we do not consume enough food to power our bodies, our metabolism will change. Our body sees constant hunger as a response to famine or situations where food is scarce. It will then respond by creating more fat, in order to store more nutrients.

, There’s nothing wrong with getting a little expert help. You can discuss your weight with your doctor to find out the healthy level for your body. You can talk to a dietitian to find good ways to eat healthier and tailor your food to your needs. You can also talk to a physical fitness trainer and learn when and how to get the right kind of exercise.

For example, some married women, looking to participate in a beauty contest, can not only enter the beauty pageant aimed towards married women but may also be eligible to enter beauty pageants such as ‘beauty after 30’ and so on.
Compare and contrast different pageant details to measure which options offer the most opportunity. Make sure that the pageant you are eligible for and trying to enter offers prizes and/or scholarships you deem worthy before you pay any entry fees.;
, There are some pageants that are only open to participants that have won pageants and held titles previously. There are state pageants who require you to have never participated for a previous national title. Some pageants consider contestants who have been married, had a marriage annulled, or who have ever been pregnant ineligible for competing. So make sure you are applying to pageants that align with your status., Similarly to what a resume does for people in a workforce, pageant resumes explain to pageant judges why you should be considered for the state or national titleholder. Follow the formatting instructions for your resume to a t, making sure that it all fits on one page.Be prepared to include your platform issue, your talent, your scholastic honors, leadership roles, accomplishments, interesting facts about you, and employment on your resume.


Margins should be set for 1” for all four sides of the Word document. The font has to be Times New Roman in the font size 10-12.
Set the justification to “left,” type “Name:” in bold, followed by hitting the space bar twice and then typing your name as you want the judges to know it. For example, Name: Candace Young.
Move to the next line and type “Title:” in bold. Hit the space bar twice and then type your state title. Repeat this action when you move to the next line and type “Hometown:” in bold as well.
Depending on the pageant, you may be asked to include answers to 2-3 open-ended questions in your resume. Those questions might be, “How has the world you come from shaped your dreams and aspirations?” or “What social issue, other than your platform, will have the greatest issue on your generation and why?”

, Keep in mind that your platform statement is the cause or issue that you choose to dedicate your time and bring awareness to. An example of a platform statement is America’s need to embrace cultural diversity and inclusiveness.Another sound example of a platform statement is poverty levels and homelessness. Think of efforts you hope to align yourself through volunteering and implementing strategy to resolve.
Choose an issue you see your nation is facing or one that affects lives globally that really resonates with you.

, This one page, single-spaced document explains to the judges what your chosen platform will be and why it is important for someone vying for the title to embrace your platform. Also explain how the platform you stand by will further the brand of the overall pageant to the public.The word document should have margins set to 1” on all four of its sides and have a font style Times New Roman with a size between 10 and 12 inches. Set the justification to the left.
Focus on what you think is critical that the judges know about your platform and why it’s necessary that you are the person who does the job and promotes the issue.
Also consider elaborating on a plan on creating awareness of the platform, your marketing strategy, media plans, and/or the way you will change behaviors regarding the issue.

, The first step to entering the beauty pageant is submitting your application (submission form, platform statement, and pageant resume), a photo (typically a headshot), and an entry fee.Applications can be written or electronic.


Pay special attention to the photo that you submit to pageants because it is the photo that will end up in the pageant program book and will represent you to judges as their first impressions of you.
The pageant director will review the application you send over and decide whether or not to consider you as a finalist to compete in the pageant alongside the other participants.
Be sure to include all of the components of your application at one time to ensure that everything is submitted by the deadline.

, After reviewing your application and doing your phone interview with the judges, you will be contacted if you’re chosen. When you’re officially accepted to compete, your entry fee is due. Pageant fees can be as much as $1800 depending upon the state or level of beauty pageant you’re entering., Once you have been approved to enter the contest and have been named a finalist, you must start preparing for the pageant. Keep it simple and don’t go overboard by spending a lot of money.


Incorporate a dance class once or twice during the week and workout to tone and strengthen your body for the competition.Take care of your nails by getting them cleaned and manicured regularly, especially before the pageant. Judges will notice your nails during the interview portion of the pageant so it is important that they are polished and well-kempt.Consider whitening your teeth. It doesn’t have to be an extensive or expensive dentist office visit; there are plenty of over the counter options that will add sparkle and whiteness to your smile as well.

, Choose age appropriate options, but if you find yourself stumped about where to go, err on the side of caution and go the traditional route. For example, a great evening gown color choice is white. Choose hair, makeup, and shoes that coordinate with that palette.Decide on a hairstyle for the pageant. Hairstyles should be neat, polished, elegant, and away from the face. Have a trim before the competition and make sure your hair is the lustrous picture of health.Practice different makeup looks and settle on one that best fits your features and your look. The goal for your makeup look should be “less is more”. Appearing too caked on will make you look false, but appearing on stage completely bare faced may make you look washed out underneath the lights.
Stay away from wearing lots of jewelry, accessories, and/or hats because it draws attention away from you instead of toward you., A strong emphasis is placed on beauty and believe it or not, beauty is health. A daily beauty regimen, focused on diet and exercise, will increase your chances of success at any beauty event.Participating in a beauty pageant is as competitive as any other sport or contest. This requires equal amount of hard work and determination to succeed.

, Have confidence in yourself and your ability to give the pageant your all. Preparation is the key to feeling confident about your capabilities.Practice the interview portion of the pageant with sample questions with friends and family members to get comfortable with answering questions on your feet with ease. Be creative and positive when you make your answers to put your best foot forward.Read up on current events so that you are not afraid to voice your opinions on certain topics. Stand firmly behind your beliefs as you answer some controversial subject matters.
Memorize your introduction so that it will become second nature to you when you introduce yourself to the judges. Most of the time, your introduction is your name, age, and hometown. Add personality by including a famous quote by someone you admire or something witty., You want to be sure that you speak loudly and clearly and that the judges hear your confidence and your passion for the title you’re trying to win. Know why you want the title and how you will use it to make your community better.Be prepared to answering questions about what makes you a great role model, your favorites, ambitions, and your career goals.
Whenever you’re asked a question, follow it up by offering a brief explanation of why you feel the way you feel. This adds another layer to your answer and infuses it with your character and beliefs.

, Hiring a coach is the quickest way to give you the upper hand in a beauty pageant. Coaches are not only well-versed in knowing the traits and qualities that judges are looking for, but they are adept at the ins and outs of pageantry., Practice your talent, walking, public speaking, your modeling stance, and facial expressions. Practice smiling in the mirror to understand the look of your facial expressions.

, Make sure that all of the components of your look are presentable for competition. The dress/outfit should look good and feel good while you’re wearing it. When you’re comfortable in what you’re wearing, you see it on your face and it helps maintain confidence.Inspect your outfit for snags, sag, bulges, or dragging. Make sure that everything fits like a glove.
Inspect your hair and makeup to make sure that there are no flyaways, strands out of place, or makeup on your teeth.

, It is important to maintain great posture while you walk because bad posture can ruin your chances of winning a pageant. Walk with your shoulders back, take appropriately sized steps, and lightly swing your arms as you glide against the stage. Focus on looking relaxed, but not too relaxed.The pageant director will provide further detail about what pattern you’re walking on, so get the foundation of a great walk and the rest will surely follow.
Always smile as you walk and be aware of where the judges are stationed to make eye contact with them as you hit your marks while you walk.

, A pageant is usually preceded by a production number, or an opening dance number. Although you are certain to have ample rehearsal time to get the routine down, if you are still feeling shaky about it, enroll in a dance class to help you improve so that you’re confident when it’s time to perform., There might be a point in the pageant where you model your favorite outfit, model a casual outfit, perform a dance routine, memorize a speech, etc. These are typically optional because they don’t add or subtract from winning the actual pageant title, but they do offer different prizes., Walking around in front of a large crowd of people agreeing to be judged for the sake of owning a coveted title can be a scary moment, but feel the fear and do it anyway. The more you participate in pageants and own the room you’re a part of, the more confident you will be because pageantry will be second nature."

When applying makeup, only wear enough so that the first row, which will typically be the judges, can see your face well. Avoid bright makeup, dark eyeliner, and frosted cosmetics. Look for matte makeup in shades that are slightly more colorful than natural shades you would wear as everyday makeup.If the pageant will be on TV, you can go a shade brighter than usual for the lipstick and blush.;
, You want the judges to see your natural beauty. Your natural beauty may be hidden if you go to face-to-face interviews wearing makeup meant for the stage. Avoid wearing a lot of foundation and false eyelashes. Instead, choose natural shades for your eyes, lips, and cheeks., A soft up-swept style is a classic for pageants that will likely not go out of style. An up-swept style could mean a French twist or bun. This style is especially great for those with very fine hair, coarse hair, or people who are aiming for a classy look.A soft up-swept style means you have your hair up, but it is not tight or slicked back. You still have some body in your hair, although it is pulled up.

, Full, wavy, and long hair is a classic style for pageants—especially the evening gown portion of the pageant. This is a look that is flattering on most and will likely not go out of style. Lately, a sleek and straight style is becoming popular as well., If a sleek or wavy style isn’t ideal for you, go for what makes you feel the most confident. Show off your natural, curly hair if that is what is most flattering for you. Or, put a little gel in your short hair and rock a pixie cut. Beauty pageants do have certain standards, but ultimately, you should feel comfortable showing off your individuality., An ideal gown accentuates your best features and camouflages your flaws. Aspects of the gown such as fabric and design can help draw the eye to the features you feel most confident about. Try on gowns that are best for your specific body type.If you have a short body type, wear vertical lines and solid colors. Avoid skirts, hip sashes, and contrasting solids.
If you have wide hips and thighs, wear flowing, tailored, or flared skirts. Avoid low waistlines and mermaid gowns.
If you’re thin, wear a fitted waist, a draped style, or a fishtail gown style. Avoid dark, strapless gowns.
Go for a straight gown or V-shape waistlines if you have a thick waist. Avoid wearing belts or hip sashes.

, The evening gown is an important part of the pageant. You should try your best to make the evening gown convey who you are to the best of your ability. Are you a loud and flamboyant or classy and conservative type? A red, sequin dress would show that you’re flamboyant. A black or white dress in a simple style would show that you’re classy.Check to see if your pageant has rules about gowns before choosing a gown.

, The wrong bra and underwear can ruin the look of your gown. Long-line bras and bust-to-hip bustiers are commonly worn under pageant gowns. These options may not be possible if your gown is made of a thin fabric. If that’s the case, sew brassiere cups into your gown. As far as underwear, panties are not recommended. Instead, try sheer-to-waist pantyhose., There are some general guidelines when it comes to picking a swimsuit for a pageant. Lined, two-piece swimsuits in a solid color are the typical choice. You can and should, however, get more specific than that. Look for a swimsuit that flatters your specific body type.If you have a small bust, wear a push-up bra, top with ruffles, or sewn-in bra to portray fullness.
If you have a large bust, try a moderate V neckline with good support. Avoid a bikini top with too many details.
If you have a straight body, go for a halter top, curved seams, and details like bows and buckles.
If you have a wider torso, try a simple suit in a muted color.

, You shouldn’t go on an extreme diet, but physical fitness is usually considered in beauty pageants. Physical fitness does not mean skinny. Maintain a healthy diet and eat enough to have energy to work out. Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, and grains daily. Make sure to drink enough water. Consult with a nutritionist if you aren’t sure how you should be eating for your physical fitness goal., The athletic look is the preferred body type in pageants lately. You should work out at least 3 or 4 times a week, though people competing in pageants will often exercise almost every day. Engage in physical activities you enjoy—like swimming, biking, or dancing for cardio, but don’t overdo it. You should also use challenging weights at the gym 3 to 4 times a week to build muscle.

Overdoing cardio would mean intense cardio sessions for an hour, but the right amount of exercise varies from person to person.
Challenging weights means something different for every person. Use whatever weights that are challenging, but not nearly impossible for you.

, Look over yourself in the mirror while wearing your swimsuit. Make sure that the top is not too tight or loose. The seat of the swimsuit should smoothly cover your bottom without wrinkles or too much exposure. The fabric should mold against your torso, even as you move., The swimsuit portion of the competition is partially judged by how you walk in your swimsuit. It is important to walk like you are absolutely confident with your body. Keep your head up and back straight as you walk. Walk at a fast pace and try to glide instead of bounce. A cat-walk style of walking is ideal., Certain talents are common in pageants—like dancing and playing instruments. It’s great if you’re a talented dancer or musician, but if you’re not, don’t try to force your talent. Choose a talent that you’d feel confident performing. For example, the talent could be something fairly unusual like ventriloquism or karate.The talent shouldn’t be something you learn right before the competition. Choose something that you’ve been practicing for at least a year.

, Practice makes perfect is a common phrase, and that’s because it’s true. Don’t wait until the pageant is just days away to practice your talent. Develop your routine and then spend time working on it every day. You should be able to go through your routine effortlessly so that you can focus on the performance aspect of the talent.If possible, get help from a coach to help you perfect your routine.

, If you’re doing a tap dance to upbeat music, you may want to choose a brightly colored costume. If you’re singing an emotional song, a long, black dress may be ideal. No matter what you’re performing, consider how you want the audience to perceive your performance when choosing a costume.Make sure your costume fits properly and doesn’t have any rips or tears before going onstage.

, You may feel nervous before going onstage, but that’s completely normal. Take a few breaths and visualize the routine you’ve worked so hard on before going performing. Go on stage with a smile and keep your head up. Even if you make a mistake, continue on and do not stop until the routine is over., A suit or dress will be appropriate for the interview stage of the pageant. Consider what you will be most comfortable wearing, and how you would like to be perceived. You don’t have to have an outfit made just for the interview. A department store outfit will be fine. Just make sure the outfit it professional and youthful.A good dress for an interview would be knee-length or slightly above, slightly conservative, and not too flashy in design. A solid color is ideal.

, The judges will almost certainly throw unexpected questions your way, but there are some questions that can be expected during the interview process. For example, you can watch past pageants to get an idea of how the interview will go. You can also ask former contestants what the interview process was like. Make sure to keep up with the news before the pageant to stay well-informed by keeping a notebook with everything you’ve learned.For example, questions about world affairs, your goals, who you are, who you admire, and your best and worst qualities are common for pageant interviews.
Some other subjects that may come up are friends, family, travel experiences, favorite music and movies, your biggest disappointments.

, You might think there is a typical “pageant personality,” but pageant winners have all sorts of personalities and interests. Don’t try to be anything other than who you are. You should be professional and kind, but sincere. Have fun with the questions and think about them carefully before answering., A question may be difficult because the answer could easily be controversial or simply because you don’t know the answer. When in doubt, go with your gut feeling. Don’t try to give an answer that sounds intellectual or “right.” Instead, tell them how you honestly feel. The judge may not personally agree, but you will be respected for having the courage to be honest.For example, if you are asked about a war you don’t agree with, don’t tell them about your opinion of the war. Instead, tell them about how you feel or would feel about a loved one being away at war.
Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” if you genuinely can’t think of an answer.

Practice.",How to Be Confident During a Beauty Pageant Interview1," It’s hard to be confident when you don’t know what to expect from the interviewing process. One of the best ways to prepare yourself is to watch the pageant interview section from past years. There are many recordings of major beauty pageants on online sites like Youtube or pageant websites.You can also try to get in touch with the organizers of the pageant if you are competing in a small or local pageant and see if they can connect with recordings.
If you can’t find footage from your particular pageant, watch interviews from similar pageants to see the kinds of questions that are posed to the contestants.;
, No one knows what the interview process is like better than people who have already been through it. Get in touch with former contestants either through contacts you may have or by connecting through email or social media. Ask them what interviewing was like for them and request advice.Ask the former contestant if there was anything about the interview that they didn’t expect, and ask them what goes on behind the scenes.
Ask the contestant if they were asked any challenging questions, and what advice they would give you for answering more difficult questions.

, Every pageant does the interviewing process slightly differently. Make sure that you understand exactly how the pageant you are competing in does the interview.


Make sure you know the length of the interview, as well as the number of questions usually asked.
Also know what time the interview is and how the interviewing process fits in with the rest of the day.
Finally, make sure you understand the judging system of the interview. Many beauty pageants have a panel of judges that assess your answers based on multiple criteria. See if there is a copy of a rubric or scorecard that judges will use that you can view to prepare for the interview.

, Many pageants require their contestants to submit paperwork to compete in the pageant. The paperwork is often the first resource that judges turn to when formulating questions for individual contestants. The judges draw information from the paperwork and ask questions relating to what the contestant wrote about themselves.Because paperwork is often used as a tool for formulating questions, it’s good to review what you wrote. This can give you a good idea of what questions you may be asked to answer.
For instance, if you wrote that you love working with animals in your bio, you may be asked in your interview what laws or regulations you think there should be in place to stop cruelty to animals.
If you wrote that you love painting, you might be asked a question about why the arts are important to society.

, Beauty pageants aren’t all glitz and glamor: contestants have to prove that they are up to date and knowledgeable about politics and current events. Follow all the major stories in the news, both nationally and internationally, as well as major issues of the past decade. Doing so will make you feel more prepared and confident as you head into the interview.Make sure you know your opinion on controversial subjects like gun control and national security.
Also be informed about local issues and politicians, especially if you are competing in a local pageant.

, Think about what differentiates you from your competition. Decide what parts of your personality and talent you want to emphasize. Then think about how you can incorporate these points into answers to common pageant questions.For instance, maybe you are a sporty girl who was a tomboy growing up. Emphasize how sports helped you grow as a person, and aim to talk about how critical sports and other extracurriculars are in school systems.

, Many beauty contestants hire a coach to prepare them for the pageant interview. In large competitions like Miss America, practically all contestants have a coach. Even if you’re competing in a small or local contest, a coach can be an invaluable resource that can be a source of comfort., Practice your answers to common interview questions. Hold mock interviews with your coach or with a trusted mentor. Even though it’s only practice, speak and hold yourself as you would for the real interview. Practicing will make the real interview feel more familiar and less scary.Record yourself answering mock interview questions, then review the tapes. With each practice round you do, try to improve on aspects of your performance.

That being said, beauty queens always wear some makeup. Learn how to apply makeup too. You could just go to a cosmetics counter at the mall, and ask to be shown a few tips.


Always wear lipstick at the pageant. You can go for a subtle look – say nude liner and a non tinted gloss – but beauty queens don’t let their lips stay bare. For a more vibrant look, line your lips with color, like pink or red, and then fill them in with matching lipstick.
It’s good to take care of your brows. Make them look natural, not overly exaggerated, but well groomed and arched. Get this done at a salon. Don’t try to do it yourself. Save the heavy makeup for the actual pageant or you could end up clogging your pores, which leads to acne.
Other makeup that is commonly worn by beauty queens includes, primer, foundation, concealer, powder, blush, eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara. Buy high-quality makeup. With a little research, you should be able to find quality makeup that doesn't break the bank. You want highly pigmented eyeliner that doesn't smear. Look for face powder that is triple milled so it doesn't become chalky.;
, Most people look better with a little color to their skin. However, using tanning beds is really risky. It can lead to melanoma and premature wrinkling. So if you’re naturally really pale, try a spray tan instead. They look pretty natural these days.


Test out the spray tan a few weeks before the actual pageant so you can make sure it looks good on your skin, and figure out the amount you want.
A good bronzing powder can also give you a glowing tan look. You want a bronzer that's not too dark. You should also invest in a bronzing brush so it applies evenly. , Pageant hair follows a certain look. You don’t want your hair too short, for example, and you want it to look elegant and to have some volume.


Pageant hair should have some style to it. It shouldn’t just hang there limply. To get volume in your hair, use a round brush. Divide the hair into sections. Work a section at a time. Try spraying a little dry shampoo into your roots. Then, use large Velcro rollers before you style your hair. Put hair spray on them, and leave them in for 20 minutes. You also may need a hairpiece. Choose one that isn’t too over-the-top. You could also add a few hair extensions if you want fuller hair. Make sure they don’t look obvious. Hairpieces can be a good idea when your hair needs some length or volume. Make sure they match your hair color and texture. They can also make your updo look better.
For nails, you want to make sure they are not chipped or with peeling paint. Instead, go for an elegant look at a nail salon, like a French manicure. Don’t forget your toes! Get a pedicure.

, Beauty queens are not low maintenance. They accessorize, and they usually do so with fine jewelry. You want to go for an elegant look.


A thin necklace with crystal or a layered necklace give you a beauty queen look. A choker will too.
Bracelets and earrings will complete the look. Choose jewelry with small gem stones. Earrings should not be too big or gaudy. The rule is to not wear jewelry that attracts more attention than your face. , Beauty queens are positive and vibrant, and so you aren’t going to see them wearing darker colors much, like black, brown or gray. Instead, wear clothing in pastels.


Wear clothes in lilac and pale blue or soft neutral shades with rose undertones. In the winter, when pastels don’t work as well, wear clothes with white, navy blue, tomato red, and green.
Think bright. It looks good on camera. Pink, red, orange and blue are colors that work well in pageants. The most common winning pageant gown color is white. , You need to go to the pageant with the right stuff in your suitcase. You will need a bling-covered dress, for example. Think quality over super trendy; try a nice department store.


Make sure your clothing matches your age. If you’re a teenager, for example, you wouldn’t want to do a too-cute routine in a cupcake dress. If the pageant participant is your young toddler, you don’t want to cake on makeup or put them in too mature of a dress because judges won’t like it, and you child is too young for that anyway.
Try to pick an evening gown that matches your personality but is not too eye popping, trashy, or bubbly. For example, a gown that is too low cut or too short or has too much bling might be seen as trashy by some judges. Gowns that are too bubbly would include those with excessive feathers or tulle. You want an elegant look. For a swimsuit, pick a solid color two-piece bikini. Don’t make it too low cut.
For an interview, you should choose a classic dress with a belt, a sheath, or a skirt suit. Don’t show cleavage. , Don’t forget the shoes to go with the dress! And you definitely need heels, not flats. Heels will make your legs look better. Pageant heels are usually 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) high.


For your evening gown, choose any length of heel you want, but make sure it matches the color of your dress or is black. Usually, pageant shoes are brightly colored.
For the swimming suit, wear heels on the lower side that match the color of the suit. For the interview, you also want to choose lower heels.

, It needs to be a talent that is appropriate, and it needs to be something you are comfortable doing. Choose something you're good at, not something you think they want.


Good choices include tap dancing, playing an instrument, baton twirling, or singing. Whatever you pick, you need to know your routines perfectly so you can let your personality shine through instead of just trying to remember the moves.Avoid anything that seems at all vulgar or otherwise inappropriate. Practice your talent. Some beauty queens say they train for two hours a day at dance. You’re not going to be good at your routine if you don’t practice it.
Unless you’re really, really good at it, stay away from the usual routines in things like dance or gymnastics. There will be a lot of competition, and if you’re not advanced at it, you might look poor in comparison and score low. Write a list of things you’re great at and things you’re not to help you settle on a talent.

, Usually pageants require an interview with the judges, often off-stage first and maybe a question on stage during the pageant. Sometimes these are one-on-one interviews, and sometimes a panel of judges will interview you.


You should write down common questions, such as “if you had one wish for the world, what would it be?” and plan your answers in advance. Practice with a friend or parent, so you get used to having an audience.
You can also purchase books that list common pageant questions to prepare in advance. , It doesn’t matter how pretty you are if you don’t have the correct training. A good coach can help you understand the ins and outs of competing in a pageant. Be aware that there are a lot of scam agencies out there. Be very wary of modeling agencies that try to make you pay them, for example. As for coaches, do your homework. Ask competitors and check professional pageant directories for references.


A coach will help you learn what to wear, what to expect, what not to do, what to pack and so on. If you've never done this before, choosing a pageant coach could give you an edge.
A good coach will help you research pageants. You want to choose a pageant that fits well with you and that you will qualify in, too. If you don't place the first time, try again. Getting pageant experience can make all of the difference.
Joining a reputable modeling agency will help you in a number of areas, including poise and confidence.

, You should hire a professional photographer to do a variety of shots for a professional photo shoot.


You want to wear your pageant wardrobe for this shoot. This won’t come cheaply, though. It's worth it. You don't want photos taken by a friend. They need to look professional.
Make sure the photographer takes headshots. These are common in pageant portfolios.

, You need to be in good shape to succeed as a beauty queen. But never starve yourself or engage in harmful dieting. Not only is it not worth it, but you won’t look healthy, and it will harm your chances.


Instead, join a gym or start attending yoga classes. Any exercise routine will work, although you want to avoid workouts that build too much muscle. Beauty queens look athletic and healthy, but they also look feminine.
Eat a sensible diet. That means drinking a lot of water, eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, keeping your portion size in control, and avoiding junk food. It’s a good idea to drink a lot of water throughout the day to get a natural glow.

, If that’s too intimidating, try staring at their forehead or nose. It will look like you’re looking them in the eye without the pressure of eye contact.


Establishing brief eye contact with the judges will draw them in and show them you are a good performer. It conveys confidence, which is so important in beauty queens.
Don’t maintain eye contact for longer than a few seconds, though, or it could come across as intentional or even creepy.

, No one wants to choose a grouchy beauty queen or one who seems inaccessible, arrogant, or who lacks confidence. Smile! It will immediately give people a good impression of you.


Show your teeth when you smile. This brings out the best in you. Get your teeth whitened before the pageant so that your smile dazzles as much as possible.
If you put petroleum jelly on your teeth at home as practice, you won’t be able to stop smiling.

, Beauty queens have great posture. This is absolutely crucial. You need to walk regally, with your shoulders back and head straight (never looking down).


Show confidence at all times. You can walk with confidence, too. If you show any awkwardness or nervousness, you’re unlikely to get a great score.
Don't crunch your back. Stand up straight! Not only will you feel more confident and beautiful, standing up straight helps improve your mood, memory, and boosts creative thinking.

, You don’t want to come across like a robot. You need to be confident enough to show your personality. Hopefully it’s sassy and fun. You need to come across like a good role model.


People get in trouble when they go negative. Stay positive at all times. Become a happy person, and show that in all you do. Be nice to the other contestants. Don’t act like a snob.
Think about the personality trait you want to showcase before the pageant. Maybe do some volunteer work before the pageant. If you win, you will be representing the pageant organization., The interview is something you should take very seriously. Beauty queens need to be more than beautiful; they need to be poised, smart, and good communicators.


If you don’t know much about the question, don’t say nothing. Find something to say even if it's not the best answer. Just do your best, and perhaps repeat part of the question at the beginning of your answer to give yourself more time. As in, ""The best way to achieve world peace is to.... etc.""
Answer honestly and from the heart. You want to be genuine. Avoid clichéd answers like “world peace.” It's helpful to get some public speaking experience first.
If you get asked a really controversial question be as diplomatic and tactful as possible - try to stay positive - but still answer honestly. "

Have confident body language.,
Smile.,
Give your answer while looking at the judges.,
Be yourself.,
Think of the interview as a chance to share yourself.,
Don’t feel like you have to know all the answers.,
Don’t dwell on the last question.,
Keep your answers short and sweet.",How to Be Confident During a Beauty Pageant Interview2," Positive body language not only makes you look confident; it can also help you to feel more at ease. Stand up straight, keep your chin up and push your shoulders back. Even as you step into the spotlight, if you hold yourself with confidence you will feel the part too.If you are sitting during the interview, sit up straight in your chair or even lean slightly forward. If you lean back, you will look too casual.

, Even if you’re nervous, remember to smile during your interview. When you first walk into the room, smile and make eye contact with each of the judges. Like your body language, a smile can actually make you feel happier and more confident., When answering questions, make eye contact with the person who asked you the question and talk to him or her. This will make it feel more like you are having a conversation than giving a speech, and should make you feel more comfortable. The judge may even respond by nodding or smiling as you are talking, which are encouraging gestures that will help you feel less nervous.It will also make you look more personable and natural if you speak to the judges.

, Don’t put pressure on yourself by trying to act like someone you’re not. Being authentic and real will make you more memorable than saying the things that you think the judges want to hear. Still, try to show yourself in the best light, but do so in a way that stays true to yourself.For instance, if you are asked what your favorite book is but you're not a big reader, give an answer that allows you to segue into a topic that interests you more. For instance, you could say, ""I love reading classic plays like A Streetcar Named Desire because theater is a passion of mine. I see plays around my city whenever I can, and I especially like musical theater.""

, You can gain a lot of confidence by shifting the way that you think of the interview. Instead of think of it as an interrogation or a way to judge you, think of the interview as a way for the judges and audience to learn more about you., One of the most common fear about interviews is being asked something that you don’t know the answer to. Remember that if you are asked your opinion about a subject you don’t know very much about, it isn’t the end of the world. You can still form a reply that leaves the judges impressed, as long as your answer shows a level of intelligence and thought.


For instance, if the judges ask you for your opinion on a conflict or war you don’t know that much about, talk about it in a general sense by saying something like, “That’s a good question. This is a topic I’m still researching and learning about, and it's upsetting to hear about the devastation that this conflict is inflicting on this part of the world. All I can hope for is that each side of the conflict can put aside their differences and compromise with each other to stop the cycle of violence.""

, Even you feel like you botched a question, don’t let it get to you. Move on mentally and give your whole attention to the question at hand. If you keep thinking about how you messed up or could have done better, the rest of your performance will suffer.If you mentally move on and give great answers to the rest of your questions, it’s likely that no one will even remember the question you messed up.

, The longest answer isn’t necessarily the best answer. The fact that a few succinct sentences are enough will help you to keep focus and stay calm throughout your interview."
"
Choose the right outfit.,
Get there on time.,
Try to relax.,
Take deep breaths.,
Don’t compare yourself to the competition.",How to Be Confident During a Beauty Pageant Interview3," Dressing to the T can give you an enormous confidence boost. Pick an outfit that you know you look good in and that is also comfortable. In general, wear an outfit that is fashionable but isn’t overly glamorous. For instance, wear a tailored blouse and a skirt instead of a low-cut evening dress. If in doubt, dress as though you are going to a job interview.Don’t wear something like a dress with straps that fall down, or extra high heels that you’re not comfortable walking in. You don’t need the anxiety of having a potential wardrobe mishap on top of your nerves about the pageant.
Make sure that your hair and makeup is also foul proof. Don’t use eyeliner that smears or put your hair up in a style that isn’t secure.

, Nothing can make your heart race like being late to something important. Even if you are feeling fine about the interview, if you get there late you may feel flustered and anxious, which will affect your performance and drain your confidence. Make sure to give yourself enough time to get to the interview, and even try to arrive a little early., Before something nerve wracking like an interview, it’s common for your mind to race out of control. Once you arrive and are waiting to go on stage, do something calming like listening to music or doing meditative exercises.Decide what is most relaxing for you. Some prefer to keep to themselves when nervous, while others like the distraction of talking to others.

, In the few minutes before the interview, try to relax. Take deep, slow breaths, thinking about the fact that you are thoroughly prepared for the interview and have done everything you can.You can also try thinking positive and empowering thoughts. Examples of these are: “This interview is going to go well” and “I am an impressive contestant.”

, Right before your interview, you may hear other contestants interviewing and answering questions. Don’t psych yourself out by comparing yourself to them or questioning your interviewing strategy based on their answers. Stay focused on your plan and try to keep a clear head.


Remember that all contestants are usually asked different questions, so don’t obsess about how you would answer one of their questions."

You want to prepare your skin as best as you can so your makeup brings out your best features.To wash your face properly, follow these steps:


Wash your face with lukewarm water and a cream cleanser. You want to avoid using too hot of water as it will dry out your skin, and too cold water will make your skin look red or splotchy. A cream cleanser will hydrate your skin and wipe off any lingering oils or makeup.
Dab your face with a towel; do not rub. Rubbing may damage your skin.
If the skin around your eyes is particularly dry, use an eye cream to moisturize.;
, Exfoliating your skin will remove the top, abrasive layer of your skin. Exfoliating too much may damage your skin, so be careful not to scrub too hard!To properly exfoliate your skin, do the following:









Concentrate on the rough and dry patches of your skin. Find the dull, flakey, or uneven patches of your skin.
Gently exfoliate upward, in smooth round motions. Do not be too heavy-handed as it may damage your skin.

, The type of moisturizer you apply will depend on your skin and the look that you are trying to achieve.








If you have oily skin, look for a moisturizer that will combat the oil and not leave your face shiny.
If you have dry skin, look for an oil based moisturizer with natural ingredients. This will help your makeup look clean and smooth as opposed to cracked and scaly.
Some moisturizers may be tinted. If you have a favorite tinted moisturizer, you can use this as a primer. If not, consider using a non-tinted moisturizer as you want your primer to act as a neutral base for your make up.

, A good primer is essential to building a blank canvas before applying makeup. It helps to hydrate and to smooth out the skin on your face. It will combat shininess or unevenness. This is similar to using a base coat when painting your nails; some may see this as an unnecessary step, but you will find it will elevate your makeup.








Primer is essential for pageant wear; you are going to be judged under harsh light and with intense scrutiny. A primer will help create a smooth surface and hide any imperfections in your skin that might otherwise not be hidden with regular makeup.Use your fingertips to apply a primer. It will help you really work the formula into your skin.
Primers come in gel, cream, or powder form. You can pick a primer based on what you want it to do for your skin.There are a number of primers on the market that advertise different effects such as smoothing, evening, covering, etc.

, You will want to pick a foundation will work with not only your skin tone but also your skin type. Generally, foundations come in powder, stick, gel, or cream form.Follow these tips to pick the right formula for your skin:


If you have dry skin -- Choose a foundation that is specifically designed for hydration. Liquids and stick foundation are creamier and may help moisturize your skin. Be careful; your skin may become sticky after application, but you can use a powder foundation to mask this.
If you have oily skin -- Choose a foundation that is oil free. Oils in foundation may cause your skin to become more oily. Using a powder foundation may help absorb your skin’s natural oils, letting your skin have a matte, healthy look.
If you have a combination of oily/dry skin -- Choose both a creamy and a powder foundation! You can strategically apply both foundations to help create an even and healthy skin tone.
Pick a foundation that looks well under harsh lighting conditions. Try out foundation looks before applying it for a pageant. You want to pick something that will look good through pictures, interviews, and stage lights. Since pageant makeup is an overall coverage, you want to start with a strong foundation to apply color and more unique details.

, You can find foundation in just about every shade imaginable; finding the perfect match should not be too difficult. Keep in mind that you are looking for a color that is more dramatic than everyday wear. You want something that will make you stand out on stage and hold up to stage lighting. Follow these tips to find what tone will work with your skin:


If you can, dip a cotton swab in your desired foundation and apply it on your jaw line. If it does not stand out and looks invisible, you have found your match.
Determine if you should use cool, neutral, or warm tones. You can decide if you should use a cool tone if the veins on your wrists stand out as blue, you burn easily, and you easily flush pink. Pick a foundation with a reddish or blueish base.
Pick a warm tone if the veins on your wrist appear a greenish color and if you quickly bronze or tan in the sun. Pick a foundation with a yellow or gold base.
If you have an equal number of green and blue veins on your wrists, you should use more of a neutral tone. You can pick either a warm or a cool foundation.
A quick tip about foundation colors: if gold looks good on you, you’re more than likely “warm.” If silver looks good on you, you’re a “cool.” If both look great on you, you are a lucky “neutral.”

, You want to apply your foundation evenly over your face. Makeup artists argue which tool to use when applying foundation.Some argue that brushes are the best with liquid foundations, while others suggest sponges for blending. Use your favorite application and apply these tips for best coverage:









Apply heavy foundation on blemishes. You want your face to look even and healthy. Apply a heavier layer on pimples or discoloration. Do not worry if it looks uneven on the first pass through, you will be going back to smooth and blend these spots out.
Blend the foundation around hairline and jawline. You definitely do not want to appear to be wearing a mask of foundation. Make sure to blend the foundation so it looks natural and smooth.

, Just like primer will create a healthy canvas for your face, foundation will apply a canvas for your eyelids. This will help your eyeshadow and eye makeup stand out and stick to your skin.









Be careful when applying foundation around your eyes. Do not get the makeup in your eyes! This can be quite painful. Use a small brush or your fingertips to apply it in these delicate locations.
Buff out any creases caused by the foundation. Once you have applied the first layer of foundation, go back through with a sponge and use a sweeping motion over your skin to smooth out any creases or uneven lines. Pay particular attention to where the makeup cakes over blemishes, creases, lines, etc. Try and make the foundation look as smooth as possible.

, You can use your foundation to help combat dark circles or other blemishes on your face. However, for extra coverage for stubborn areas, you must pick a good concealer. You want to choose one that blends well with your foundation.









When picking and applying a concealer, you want one that will blend smoothly. If not, the stage lighting will show ""layers"" to your makeup and accentuate, not hide, your blemishes. When buffing creases, be sure to look at your skin under different types of lights to catch any of these issues., By now, your face is probably feeling a bit sticky but for a pageant you will need a matte finish. Take a foundation powder, around the same shade as your first foundation, and dust it lightly over your face using a brush.









This will help your foundation stick to your face longer, and help with the “stickiness.” This will also help your makeup look more natural and less like paint.

, You will use a light, a medium, and a dark color. The colors you pick are entirely up to you. You can pick colors based on your eye color or you can pick colors depending on what type of event you will be attending.For example, if you are participating in a night event, you may want to consider darker, bolder colors with a sparkle or shimmer.
You may want to consider different looks for different parts of the pageant. For an interview, you probably do not need a very dramatic look. Instead, consider using more neutral colors for a more professional look.

, Divide your eyelid in thirds. Use each color on a third of your eyelid, starting with the lightest shade.









Using the lightest shade, create a triangle on the inside corner of your eyelid, nearest to your nose. Brush a line of the lightest powder along your brow bone. This is the first step to creating a bold eye look.
Apply the medium color to the middle of your eyelid. Make a medium-sized rectangle in the middle of your lid.
Use the darkest shadow and make a triangle on the outside of your eyelid. This should cover the last third of your eyelid, on the outside of your lid.

, Now you want the colors to pop but look like they belong together. Take a small brush and use the medium color to blend light to medium and then dark to medium. Blending is important! You want the colors to blend into one, not look like three separate parts. Using the medium color will make the color change look more natural. It bridges the two colors together.









Add a finishing touch using the darkest color. Use a thin eye shadow brush to contour your eye shadow. Swipe the brush from the outside corner of your eyelid crease to the inside corner of your eyelid.

, Pick an eyebrow pencil that is slightly darker than your natural eyebrow color. Determine what shape eyebrow you are going for. Do you want a thicker look or a more arched look? Again this depends on what look you want.








Using short strokes, form the desired eyebrow shape on your eyebrows. This is dependent on your face and eyebrow shape. Do not go against the shape of your eyebrow. Instead, use your eyebrow bone as a guide for a more natural shape and always follow the direction of your hair.
It is important to fill out your eyebrows well and make them bold. They need to stand out on stage. There is a fine line between bold and gaudy, so try and stick with a color that fits your hair and skin tone.

, If you are comfortable using eyeliner and have applied it before, you may go for a liquid or gel eyeliner. If you are new to using eyeliner, you may use a pencil eyeliner as it is easy to fix if you make a mistake.








If the liquid or gel eyeliner comes in a small pot, apply it using an eyeliner brush. If you are using a pencil eyeliner, hold it like you would a normal pencil in your dominant hand. Apply a thin line on the top inside of your eyelid, forming a thicker line as you move outward.
For your bottom lid, make a line on the inside of your eyelid (also called the water line). This is not beneath the lash line, but on the inside the lid itself. Be careful not to poke yourself in the eye as you do this.

, You can even layer two different mascaras to get your desired effect. For example, some mascaras are great for volume while others are great for color. Use both for a fuller, darker look.









Slide the brush out of the tube slowly, making sure there is an even amount of mascara on only sides of the brush. Apply the mascara to your eyelashes, starting with your top eyelashes. Move the brush from the bottom of your lashes to the ends of your lashes in one fluid motion. You can apply several layers of the mascara, but avoid overdoing it as you do not want the mascara to clump to your eyelashes.
You can also apply mascara to your lower lashes. You will likely have less lashes on the bottom of your eye so apply the mascara carefully, applying one to two layers on your lower lashes.

, Your choice of lipstick with depend on your skin tone and your look.Identify your skin undertone. Is your undertone more yellow or pink? Yellow is warmer, and pink is cooler. This is very similar to picking the right foundation color; you want to pick a lip color that goes with your undertone.
Once you have identified your skin tone, you can look for lip liner, lipstick, and lip gloss in colors that will complement your skin tone. For example, if you have a cooler skin tone, you may choose reds that have some blue in them, while warmer skin tones often look good with orange based reds. You can ask a beauty consultant at your local make up counter for more advice if you have trouble determining your skin tone.

, Using short strokes with the liner pencil, fill in your lips. This will help the lipstick pop and stick to your lips. Think of the lip liner as adding foundation to your lips, preparing them for the lip color.









Make your top lip look a bit bigger that your bottom. Use your lip liner and gently shape your desired lip shape. You want to make this look bold, but natural. Do not exaggerate this too much or it will look unnatural.
You can also play around with the liner to make the shape that you want. Experimenting is key here!

, Follow your lip liner and apply the lipstick to your lips. Try to do this in a fluid motion, running the lipstick over your top lip and your bottom lip.









Once you apply the lipstick, you should fold a piece of clean tissue in half and close your lips over it. This will help to seal in the color on your lips.
You should also check that there is no lipstick on your teeth. Open your mouth and smile to confirm this.

, Avoid putting gloss all over your lips; instead, you want to contour your lips with the gloss.









This tip is very similar to how you can contour your nose to look different. Applying lip gloss on the center of your lips will make them look fuller.
Lip gloss will also help your lips photograph well and make them noticeable from the stage.

, Highlighting powder can be a good final touch for your face and help to bring attention to your stand out features. You should select a highlighting powder based on your skin tone.








If you have fair skin, you should use a pearl colored pressed powder. If you have a fair to medium skin tone, you should select a champagne toned highlighter or a pale pink highlighter. For medium to dark skin tones, go for a highlighter in a neutral peach shade and avoid highlighters with any yellow in them. Darker skin tones should go for a highlighter with a gold shimmer.
Start by lightly running the highlighting powder underneath the arch of your eyebrows and in the inner corner of your eyelids. You should also apply it on the bridge of your nose just between your eyes. Make sure you brush the powder away from your nose and eyes.
You should also run the brush on the high points of your cheeks. This line of contour powder will help your cheekbone pop and add dimension to your face.
Finally, put a small amount of highlighter above your lips, at your Cupid's bow. Always brush out, moving away from your nose and mouth to avoid getting powder on your lips.

, This will help to thin out your cheeks. Apply a small amount of bronzer; you do not want to make it look unnatural or out of place.









Next you can finish your look by applying blush right above your bronzer. The color is dependent on how bold of a look you want. The darker color you use, the bolder the look will be. You want to emphasize the apples of your cheek.
If you want a thinner nose, use a brush and brush the bronzer down the sides of your nose. This will highlight your nose and manipulate the way it looks.

, Go over your face and add more color if you need to. Or, you can go back and buff out any trouble spots that you notice.Because you have applied this look in layers, you can easily touch up any spots that you are unhappy with by repeating the steps of this process.

Keep in mind the cost of alterations when planning your budget- this cost is many times overlooked, but is very important. Also budget in for accessories you will need- shoes, jewelry, undergarments, etc.


Do you have a very small or no budget? Prepare to get creative! You may have to compromise on some points depending on how stringent your resources are, but you can still pull off a fabulous look. Check out the tips section for more ideas.

, To do well in the Evening Gown competition, the key is knowing yourself well enough to find your ideal signature style, then revealing to the judges your poise and confidence. To do that, you must first establish a gown style that is unique to you.


To reveal your gown style, ask yourself these questions:

Which of my physical features make me feel great/unique/special and how can I make them pop? Have great shoulders? Choose a strapless or one shoulder gown! Amazing legs? A gown with a higher slit would be gorgeous on you! You get the idea- choose your favorite features and plan to play them up. Take into consideration your skin tone, hair style, and preferred make-up combination as well.
What are some circumstances of competition that may affect my gown choice? Are you competing in a Teen, Miss or Mrs. pageant? Teens may be more trendy, Mrs. may remain a little more conservative, where the Miss may be more fashion forward and risk taking. If you are unsure, don't be afraid to ask your pageant director or mentor for his or her thoughts on this.
Take into consideration the atmosphere when choosing your gown-

Where is the pageant being held- an auditorium, banquet hall, or outside? A bright color or white may be a good choice for on stage- black curtains can make a dark gown disappear, or nudes could wash out your skin tone.
Think of the season and time of year. Is it a Spring pageant? Winter? Try to choose a gown to fit the general mood as well as your style and attributes.
Consider your back-stage needs and make it as easy on yourself as possible. Pageants usually have very quick changes with little room and few hands to help. Dresses with a complicated corset or special requirements end up stressing you out and could even cause a last minute wardrobe malfunction. Choose a gown that is ""easy-in, easy-out"" or be sure of your ability to recruit the help you need to make the smoothest transition on stage.


Do your homework. Arm yourself with the information you need to make the best decision. After you've narrowed down your budget, atmosphere, and features to flaunt,  it all comes down to your own personal sense of style to make your ""gown profile"". Need help narrowing it down? Here are a few ideas:

Think of your ""signatures."" Do you have certain aspects of your style that make you you? A favorite flattering color? A penchant for sparkle? Choosing something meaningful in your dress gives you that one-of-a-kind feeling and will give you that ""it"" factor on the big day.
Poll your Mom, Sister, friends, or whoever else may give you some insight into your style. Ask them their impression of your style and what flatters you. Remember to stay true to yourself, but honest, straight forward advice from people you trust may open your eyes to things you may not have considered. Chose one or two of these confidantes to go gown shopping with you! Supportive, patient helpers are a godsend!
Get to your style source! Choose celebrities whom you admire for their style and search for photos of them at award shows or red carpet events. Search actresses or models who have similar features as you, and see how they accentuate their look. Browse blogs or fashion magazines for inspiration.
Google it! That's right- time to browse! Search around for the options that fit your gown profile. Depending upon your above-mentioned stipulations, many websites selling gowns have handy search features to filter your choices by price, color, style, and trend. Don't be afraid to browse a little outside of your profile- you may be surprised by a color or cut you hadn't thought of. Locate stores near you that carry prom, bridal, and occasion wear. Most of these stores have online inventories or have links to the designers they carry.


Go shopping around. Take your confidant or go solo and actually put some gowns on. Feel how different styles and fabrics fit you. Move in them- walk, sit, stretch- make sure they are comfortable and fit correctly. Most importantly, bring with you heels and a bra and undies you may possibly wear the day of. Good undergarments make all the difference! Make notes of your experiences, and take note of the dress size, designer, and style number, located on the tag. Make yourself a master list of dresses and try to narrow them down to your top two choices. Remember to be a confidant, considerate shopper. You have come prepared, and you are the one ultimately wearing this gown!

 In the experience of some, sales ladies and gents can be extremely helpful or hurtful, and everywhere in between. It is suggested only working with those you are comfortable with. You are well within your rights to say ""No thanks, I think I am okay browsing on my own for now. Is it alright to ask for you when I find something I like?"" A good salesperson will give you your space and attend to needs like helping you find another size, color, or style you like. They can also use dressing clips to show you how a dress might look if altered or give you suggestions.
Never feel pushed or pressured into a gown you aren't head-over-heels about. Chances are, this is an investment for you. Why let someone else spend your money for you on something they aren't wearing?
Always be polite and courteous to everyone who (tries to) help you- you may even make a new friend or great contact for future wardrobe purchases!





, Choose that gown that makes you feel the most special, fits your body correctly, and emulates your style and best features. Shop around online and in-store to find the best value for your budget and go for it!

, At least once per week, get in that dress to check for fit, and take it for a walk in a clean, flat surfaced environment. Be aware of a long train, floating skirt, or anything that may impede your pageant walk. Practice walking at a much slower pace than usual. When you are finally on stage, it feels like an eternity up there, but you are giving the judges the MOST time to admire you! Also, train your feet in your heels by wearing them whenever possible and practicing walks and turns. This is to make you feel as at ease as you possibly can be come pageant time!

, Once your gown is purchased, you are probably nearing the one month marker for pageant day. You are amping up your fitness routine to look your very best for the competition. This means that your size is likely to change between now and then.


Search around your area for a seamstress who is knowledgeable about formal wear alterations and schedule an initial fitting to speak about where the dress will need altered closer to the pageant day. Remember to bring your undergarments and heels!
Make the last minute changes to your gown at your last fitting within 5-7 days of pageant day. Pick up your final fitted dress, pressed and ready, and lay it flat when transporting it to the pageant. Hang it up immediately upon arrival and bring a steamer with you to get out last minute wrinkles.

, Seriously, you put so much care and effort into looking like your very best you- present yourself as if you were born to wear your dream gown and take their breath away! Give the judges your best eye contact and smile. Breathe and begin your slow, confident, graceful walk, sweeping your dream gown effortlessly across the stage. Don't forget to look over your shoulder while turning and exit, knowing you did your ultimate best!

A nice, professional-style dress or a silk blouse with a pencil skirt will do just fine. Be sure that whatever you wear touches or goes past your knees, as anything shorter may make you seem ""floozy"".;
, This is a surefire way to get the judge to remember you, and will also allow a little bit of your personality to shine through. Be yourself in choosing this one splash of life.

, There's no need for the heavy makeup you wore on stage -- judges will see right through this. Brush on a little eyeshadow and some light lipgloss to make your lips appealing, as these will be your most looked-at features.

, You may have to practice a pretty, convincing smile that makes you seem genuine.

, After being on stage, it will be hard to make make your hair seem too natural. If the interview round is the last one, it's okay to unpin your hair. Brush it out once and then pin your bangs away from your face.

, Also, avoid simple yes-or-no answers. Back up yes-or-no questions with a reason. For instance, if the judge says: ""I see on your application that you are involved in a large number of service organizations. Do you feel service work is important?"" You should reply something like this: ""Yes, I feel service work is important because I feel it can change lives for the better and make our community and even greater place.""

, Of course, preparation is good, but it's nearly impossible to know EXACTLY what any judge is going to ask you. Write down a list of basic questions that you feel you may be asked, and practice them. Don't focus too much on what you say though. Focus on how you say it: in a clear, level tone, with proper enunciation and a bright smile.

It can be hard to speak about yourself to someone you don't know, especially when you know they're giving you a score based on your answers! Focus on taking deep, slow breaths and talking in a level tone. Avoid tapping your feet, drumming your fingers, biting your lip, or doing anything else that expresses anxiety or compulsion, or this will be a dead giveaway.

, Nothing is more beautiful than a confident young woman who knows who she is. When your answers come straight from your heart (with a little bit of polish, of course) you'll seem real, genuine, and an overall shoo-in. This means saying the first answer that pops into your head (as long as it's not too rough!).

Research your topic.,

Ask other people for their experience and ideas.,
Take notes.,
Add a little something to your oral report.,
Use layout to your advantage.,
Look over and review your written report.,
Practice the report before giving it.",How to Prepare for an Oral Report," If your topic initially seems quite boring, it means that you have taken a fairly superficial approach to it. There is always a story behind every topic and there are always things to discover that you didn't know. Look for the unusual, the untold and the unknown behind even the most commonplace and well known of topics. Plan to bedazzle your classmates with interesting facts that they didn't know.;
, Don't presume that all there is to know is available on the internet. A lot of it is yet to make it online, and much of what is online is often opinion rather than fact. So get down to the library, haul out some good books and learn different angles and greater details than simple web trawling will return.

, Some topics will be perfect for you to do real world research on. Family, friends, local businesses, professionals and experts are good people to ask questions of. Note the time and date of your interviews with them and keep a written record of the key points so that you can reference these if classmates or the teacher ask. Oral evidence of your topic can often be the most engaging, as it comes from people who know the subject-matter well and can bring to light real life examples. Practical examples that relate to real life can help everyone to learn better.

, Don't be afraid to jot down details.


Make your writing interesting. Be sure to use better words than the standard and obvious ""nice"" or ""big."" Rather opt for words such as ""gigantic"" or ""fantastic.""

, Perhaps add pictures or make a life size model from the topic. Drawing a time line, especially if it's a history report, can also work well to help others visualize the period or occasion to which you're referring.

, Put the report together in such a way that you can find the information with ease, keep your place and learn as much of the material by heart as possible.


Make bullet points. These are easier to memorize and read from quickly.

, Add details where needed and exchange words with those that would fit the report better. If you have made statements that are bold or controversial, do you have sound references to back them up? Make sure that you have easy access to these.

, Look at yourself in the mirror and talk as if you're in front of people. Make sure that you're not leaning or fumbling around when you talk. With a bit more practice, you will be able to ace that report and look good at the same time


Don't try to say your oral word for word; this will make you nervous and queasy if you try to remember everything word for word. It can also look a bit over-the-top unless you are engaging in your delivery; avoid simply reciting something learned off-by-heart.
Tell the story; it doesn't have to be said exactly the way you wrote it––you just need to tell the story. That said, your oral presentation should reflect some of the things you wrote in the report.

It's best to leave yourself ample time to write and revise the essay, ideally giving yourself time for a break between drafts. If you're approaching a deadline, however, you may need to make the best use of the time you have.;
, While it's important to prepare to write, when it comes down to it, you just have to start putting content on the page. Remember that you can always go back and ""fix"" things later and that substantive revisions are part of the writing process.

, Your thesis is one of the most important elements of your essay. A thesis statement summarizes the main argument or position of your essay in one sentence. It lets readers know what the essay will attempt to show or prove. Everything in your essay should be connected to your thesis in a straightforward way.Your instructor will expect to see a well-crafted thesis early on in your essay. Place your thesis at the end of your first paragraph.
If you do not understand how to write a thesis, then ask your instructor for help. This is an important concept that will keep coming up in other English courses as well as any other courses where you have to write papers.

, Once you have a compelling thesis statement, you can craft the rest of your introduction around it. You can also save this step for after you've drafted the body of your essay if you feel intimidated by the introduction. The best introductions ""grab"" the reader and make them want to keep reading. Some effective strategies for creating an introduction include:Telling a personal anecdote
Citing a surprising fact or statistic
Overturning a common misconception
Challenging the reader to examine her own preconceptions

, Outlining can help you to develop a basic structure for your essay and you can use this when you are ready to draft your essay as well. Look over your notes and invention exercises and think about how you can organize this information in an outline. What should come first, second, third, etc.?You can create a numbered outline using a word processor or just put it on paper.
Don’t worry about being too detailed when you create your outline. Just try to get the basic ideas on paper.

, Before you start to write, gather together all of the notes, books, and other materials that you will need to draw on to answer the essay prompt. Support is essential for an effective English essay, so do not try to write your essay without these materials. If you have time, read through your notes before you begin.


Make sure that you have your outline handy as well. You can build on the outline that you created to help you as your draft your essay. Just try to expand on each of the points in your outline in the order that you have placed them.

, Topic sentences signal to readers what a paragraph will discuss. Start each of your paragraphs in an essay exam with a topic sentence so that your instructor will be able to see that your ideas progress in a clear, direct manner.Think of the topic sentence as way to tell readers what you will talk about in the rest of the paragraph. You don’t need to summarize the whole paragraph in a topic sentence, just provide readers with a taste.
For example, in a paragraph that describes Okonkwo’s rise and fall in Things Fall Apart, you might begin with something like: “Okonkwo starts out as a poor young man, but then rises to a position of wealth and status.”

, Make sure that you include as many details as possible for your answers. Remember that padding (filling in with meaningless text or using extra wordy sentences) is not an effective strategy for writing essays because instructors can see right through it. Your instructor has probably read hundreds, if not thousands of student essays over his or her career, so she will know when an essay has been padded. Fill your essays with details that make your essay useful and insightful instead. If you get stuck, some good strategies for developing your ideas include:



Returning to the invention stage. To develop your ideas as much as possible, try returning to an invention exercise such as freewriting, listing, or clustering. You can also revisit your notes and books to see if there is anything that you missed or forgot.

Visiting your school’s writing lab. If your school has a writing lab, then pay a visit to them with your essay in hand. You can find a writing lab on most college campuses. Writing labs are free to students and they can help you to improve your writing at any stage in the writing process.

Talking to your instructor. Some instructors are happy to meet with their students and help them with their essays. If your instructor holds regular office hours or allows students to make one-on-one appointments, then take advantage of this resource. Meet with your instructor and discuss ways that you can improve your essay before you hand it in.

, If you use any sources at all in your essay, then you will need to cite them using the style that your instructor prefers. MLA style is the most common citation format used in English courses, so you will need to know how to use it. You will need to provide in-text citations as well as a works cited page at the end.


An MLA style works cited page starts on a new page at the end of your paper. In a works cited page, you will need to provide entries for each of the sources that you used. These entries should provide enough information that the reader could locate the source with ease. For example, a works cited entry for a book would include with the Author’s last name and first name, title of the work, publication information, year published, and the format.MLA style in-text (also called parenthetical) citations provide readers with the author’s last name as well as the page number for the information. It is necessary to include an in-text citation for any information that you quote, summarize, or paraphrase from a source. The in-text citation comes right after the information form the source and it includes the Author’s last name and page number in parentheses.For example, an in-text citation for a quote from Things Fall Apart would look like: ….” (Achebe 57).

, The general structure of an essay usually goes from broad to specific. You could visualize this tendency as an upside-down pyramid or as a funnel. By the time you get to your conclusion, it should feel as though the information in your conclusion is inevitable. It's essentially a recap of everything you've spent your whole essay trying to prove.However, there is also potential to use your conclusion for other purposes. You may find that you want to use your conclusion to:


Qualify or complicate the information in your essay
Suggest a need for further research
Speculate on how the future will change the current situation

, Leaving your essay to the last minute is not a good idea. Try to allow yourself at least a couple of days to revise your work, or more if possible. It is important to take a one to two day break from your essay after you have completed it. Then you can come back to it and revise with a fresh perspective., Some people only focus on the grammar and punctuation when revising an essay, but this is less important than the content of your essay. Answer the essay question in as much detail as possible. Reread the essay question or assignment guidelines and ask:Have I answered the question in a satisfactory way?
Do I have a clear thesis? Is my thesis the focus of my essay?
Do I include adequate support for my argument? Is there anything else I could add?
Is there a logic to my essay? Does one idea follow the next? If not, how might I improve the logic of my essay?

, Having a friend or classmate take a look at your work can be helpful as well. Someone else may catch simple errors or notice something else that you missed because you have been looking at the document so much.Try swapping essays with a friend from class. You can read and comment on each other’s essays to make sure that both of you have done the best work possible.
Make sure that you swap papers at least one day before the paper is due so that you will have time to correct any errors that your friend finds.

, Reading your essay aloud can help you to catch simple errors that you might not have caught otherwise.Read your essay out loud slowly and have a pencil nearby (or be prepared to edit on your computer).


As you read, correct any errors that you find and underline anything that you think could be improved, such as by adding more details or clarifying the language.

, Take time to read over the essay question or guidelines and think about what the assignment is asking you to do. You should underline any keywords such as describe, compare, contrast, explain, argue, or propose. You should also underline any central themes or ideas that the assignment asks you to discuss such as freedom, family, defeat, love, etc.If you do not understand what an assignment is asking you to do, then ask your instructor. It is important to make sure that you have a clear idea of what your instructor wants before you start working on the assignment.

, Your instructor is your primary audience for the essay, so you will need to consider your instructor’s needs and expectations before you write.Some basic things that your instructor will need and expect from you may include:


a well-detailed answer that satisfies the assignment requirements
a clear and direct piece writing that is easy to follow
a polished paper with no minor errors, such as typos or misspellings

, After considering your instructor’s expectations, take some time to think about how you can accomplish these broad goals. Consider what you will need to include in your essay.


For example, if you are tasked with writing about a character in a book, then you will need to provide lots of details about that character. This will probably require rereading some passages of your book as well as revisiting your notes from class.To make sure that your paper is easy to follow, you will need to make sure that there is a logical order to your essay. You can accomplish this goal by taking time to create an outline and checking your work for logic when you are through.
Having a polished paper will be easier if you start early and allow yourself lots of time to revise before you have to turn in the final draft. If possible, try to complete your first draft about one week before the paper is due.

, Invention exercises can help you to draw out details that you already know, which can give you a great jump start on writing your essay. Some useful invention exercises include:Freewriting. With this exercise, you simply write as much as you can without stopping. Even if you can’t think of anything to write, write “I can’t think of anything to write,” until something else comes to mind. After you finish, read over what you have written and underline or highlight any information that might be useful for your essay.

Listing. Listing is where you make a list of all of the details and information that are relevant to the essay prompt. After you have listed everything that you can think of, read over it and circle the most important information for your essay.

Clustering. Clustering is where you connect ideas using lines and circles on a piece of paper. For example, you might start with your topic written at the center of the page and then branch out from this central focus with other connected ideas. Keep branching out and drawing connections until you cannot do any more.

, If you have been asked to conduct research for your paper, then you will want to do this before you begin drafting as well.Use your library’s databases and other resources to find the best information possible for your paper.


Good sources to use for English essays include books, articles from scholarly journals, newspaper articles from trustworthy news sources (NY Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.), and government or university sponsored web pages.
Many instructors include “research quality” in their grading criteria, so including poor sources such as blogs and author less web sources, may result in a poor grade.
If you are not sure if a source is of good quality, ask your instructor or a librarian.

Use transitions to move smoothly between multiple characters.,
Alert your reader to a transition before you shift to another character’s perspective.,
Have a character take the lead in the action.,
Experiment with the third person omniscient POV in shorter work before trying it in longer work.",How to Write in Third Person Omniscient," Any point of view, or POV, whether its first person or third person should provide the reader with insight into that character’s thoughts, feelings, emotions and knowledge.


Point of view should let the reader know how your character feels and thinks, as well as what they see around them, within a certain setting.;
, In this POV, the narrator has access to all the thoughts and feelings of the characters in the story and is not limited to only one character’s point of view. So as the author, you can shift from one character’s POV to another character’s POV, and the same events can be interpreted by several different character voices.Because the POV is omniscient, it has a “god like” distance from the characters and can have a bird’s eye view of the events, actions, and thoughts of the characters.
As the author, this POV gives you a lot of freedom to inhabit many character voices and perspectives., Unfortunately, being god like has its downsides. Because you are viewing your characters from above, you are also presenting them to your readers at a distance and this can lead to more telling than showing in the story. This may not allow your reader to connect as deeply with the characters and can lead to a dull or stiff narrative.If you are writing a more character driven story, the third person omniscient POV may not be ideal, as it does not allow you to embody one character’s perspective in detail, including their thoughts and emotions.
If your story is more plot driven and wide in scope, the third person omniscient POV may work better for you, as it allows you to move through scenes with multiple characters, as well as through time and space fairly easily, when done right.
Regardless of which POV you use, you want to always ensure the reader can relate to the characters and is never lost or confused., Another advantage this POV has over other POV is that as the author, you can talk directly to your reader, creating a more intimate, direct relationship with them.This could be as simple as stating, “Dear reader, it was a hard decision to kill off Alice. Let me tell you why.”
Or a less direct address to the reader, such as, “Don’t worry about Alice. She’ll have some hard times but eventually, she’ll recover and live happily ever after.”

, This point of view can be categorized into two types: objective and subjective.The objective version is the “fly on the wall” POV, where the narrator is present but invisible in the story. They will relate the events as they happen, but do not offer any opinions on the events. This POV is like a camera that follows the characters around, showing their actions and dialogue, and not entering into the internal thoughts of the characters.
The subjective version has a strong narrative voice that discusses the characters’ internal thoughts within a scene. So all the emotions and thoughts of the characters are filtered through the narrator’s voice, in their own words.

, If you are trying to explore an idea through multiple narrators, but want to show their emotions through action and dialogue, rather than internal thoughts, the objective third person omniscient POV may be right for you.


If you want to write a story with a strong narrator who frames the characters with their narrative voice, the subjective third person omniscient may be a better fit for your story.

, Rather than using “I”, which is first person POV, or addressing the reader as “you”, which is second person POV, address the characters by their names or by the applicable pronoun, such as: he, she, his, hers, him and her.


For example, instead of writing: “I arrived in town on a cold, windy morning,” you would write, “She arrived in town on a cold, windy morning” or “Alice arrived in town on a cold, windy morning.”

, When you write in this point of view, remember that the narrator is usually an unknown entity as it is acting as an all seeing eye. So you do not need to give the narrator a name or provide any information about them to the reader.


This is different than the first and second person perspectives, where the narrator plays a starring role in the work and dominates the point of view.

, The most well known example of this type of narrator is the “Lemony Snicket” character in “A Series of Unfortunate Events.” The “Lemony Snicket” narrator identifies himself as “I”, but also addresses the reader directly and shifts into different character perspectives throughout the novel., Not doing this can lead to a point of view breach.A POV breach occurs when a character knows something that he or she couldn’t possibly know from his or her point of view. For example, even though the narrator may know that Paul hit John from behind, John won’t know Paul hit him, unless he discovers this information from outside sources or by process of elimination.
A POV breach can also take away from the believability of the story as a whole, and undermine the character voices you have worked so hard to create. So watch out for any breaches of point of view.
Another issue that can arise is head hopping, where you hop around from one character’s thoughts to another character’s thoughts within one scene. Though technically a correct way to do third person omniscient POV, this technique can be confusing for the reader and lead to too many thoughts crowding up the scene., To avoid confusing your reader and head hopping around, focus on creating a bridge or smooth switch to another character in the scene.

, Do this by drawing the reader’s attention to the character and describing the actions or movements of the character in the scene.


For example, if you are shifting from Paul’s perspective to John’s perspective, you could note: “John rubbed his lower back, where he had been hit. He noticed Paul standing beside him. Could Paul have bumped into him? John thought.”

, This is a good way to transition to a new viewpoint. Once the new character takes the lead in the action, continue into his or her thoughts or feelings.


For example: “John slammed his drink down hard on the bar. Who is the jerk who hit me? he yelled. John noticed Paul, standing beside him. Who is that guy? John thought.”

, The third person omniscient can be difficult to master on your initial attempts, especially if you are not used to writing in the heads of many different characters and are still learning how to transition from one character to another.Sit down and write out several scenes in this POV to get a feel for it. Reread and edit your work to see where you are head hopping or where there are POV breaches and correct them.

Put a pot of water on to boil.,
Hold the envelope over the boiling water.,
Apply constant light pressure on the flap.",How to Steam Open an Envelope1," You don't really need much water, but try to put an inch-and-a-half in the bottom of the pot, and put it on the heat. If you use too much water, it will take forever to boil, but don't use too little, or it'll evaporate before you can open the envelope. As you wait for the water to boil get ready with your envelope.;
, With the side of the envelope with the opening flap facing down towards the water, find a spot where you can gently ease your thumb under the flap. A good spot is at the very end of either side of the flap, because some envelopes don't have any glue there.

, Be gentle, you don't want to tear the paper. Once the steam saturates the envelope (it will feel hot, damp and limp), the glue will melt, and the envelope will open.


Don't hold the paper in the steam for too long. You'll get it all soggy and give the game away. Hold the envelope over the steam for about 15 seconds, then start trying to open it, returning to the steam if it is still stuck.
Consider using a skewer instead of your thumb or finger to peel the flap up. It allows for more precise control and is especially effective if you place the skewer vertically underneath the flap at one end and twirl it along the length of the flap.

Use the active voice.,

Use “and” to join two statements.,
Use a semi-colon to create a more complex sentence.,
Link two ideas with a transition word.",How to Write Declarative Sentences," A declarative sentence is a statement made directly by the speaker to the listener. It conveys information directly. For example, the following are examples of declarative sentences:


The cat sits on the mat.
I started to laugh.
That cloud looks like a fish.;
, Declarative sentences are different from other types of sentences. In order to better understand grammar and writing, learn to identify other common types of sentences. Some of these include:Interrogative: This type of sentence is used to pose a question (e.g., “Will you drive me home?”)
Imperative: This type of sentence is used for delivering orders or directives (e.g., “Get on the bus.”)
Exclamatory: This type of sentence is expressed in such a way as to convey excitement or exclamation. It is usually indicated by the punctuation at the end of the sentence, typically in the form of an exclamation point (e.g., “How nice you are!”).

, At its core, the declarative sentence is very basic. There is a noun and a verb in the sentence. The sentence can have other elements, such as adjectives, adverbs and other words. But the simplest form is just a noun and verb.


The verb in a declarative sentence can be in any tense form (present, future, past, etc.).

, Declarative sentences can be any length. They can convey very basic, simple information (such as: “I ate a hot dog.”), or they can convey lots of complex information (such as: “The movie represented women in a positive light, particularly when the main female character defused the bomb in the car.”).


The sentence is declarative if it makes a statement, rather than asking a question, giving an order, or making an exclamation.

, A simple declarative sentence conveys information directly. Figure out the essence of what you want to communicate.How will you state this information in a simple way? When writing a simple declarative sentence, use one idea and eliminate excess phrases and words.

, A declarative sentence is made up of two basic elements: the noun, or subject, and the verb, or predicate. Convey information directly and simply by choosing the most basic information. Some examples include:


“Jane eats.”
”The cat meows.”
”The car moves.”

, The active voice is a style that directly conveys information. It uses descriptive verbs that gives the reader substantial information in few words.In contrast, the passive voice relies on words like “is” or “was” in a way that conveys information less directly. You can still use the passive voice for a declarative sentence. But the whole point of a declarative sentence is to be direct and to the point, so the active voice is preferred.

, One way to recognize different types of sentences is to examine the punctuation at the end of the sentence. A declarative sentence uses a period at the end of the sentence. In contrast, an interrogative sentence typically uses a question mark at the end of the sentence. An exclamatory sentence uses an exclamation mark.

, A declarative sentence doesn’t need to be a simple sentence. Create a more complex statement that conveys more information. Build upon one idea by using the word “and” to join it with more information. Include a comma before “and.”For example: “I caught a fish, and I threw it back into the water.”

, Another way to build upon the idea in your declarative sentence is to use a semi-colon. This creates another clause in your sentence, or a related idea that contributes more information to the message you’re conveying.For example, “Mary had a little lamb; its fleece was white as snow.”

, A transition word, known as a conjunction, links two ideas that are related. They can be used to build upon an idea, or they can be used to contrast an idea. Examples of transition words or phrases include: “however,” “in fact,” “nevertheless,” “moreover,” and “besides.”


For example: “I am moving to a new house next week; in fact, I’m buying my first house.”
“I’ve gotten used to sleeping outside when I go camping; however, I really like sleeping in a feather bed.”

Put the kettle on to boil with plenty of water.,
Hold the envelope a little away from the spout.,
Ease open the envelope.",How to Steam Open an Envelope2," Instead of using a stove, you can use a kettle. This technique tends to create a greater quantity of steam that is hotter. It also avoids the possibility of scorching the edges of your envelope if you have a gas stove.

, Don’t hold it too close and try to get an even distribution of steam across the seal. You can place a spoon into the spout of the kettle to try to have control over the direction of the exiting steam. If it looks like it is getting too wet, move it away and be patient, you don’t want to have wrinkles give the game away.


As the steam from a kettle is more intense, it might be a good idea to wear an oven glove or something similar to protect the hand holding the envelope.

, Wait for a few seconds after removing it from the steam and then, in much the same way as with the stove method, gently slide a flat blade under the seal to open and release it. Be very careful not to tear it, and if it doesn’t come easily give it a little more time in the steam and try again.

Put some water in your iron and plug it in.,
Put the envelope on a suitable surface.,
Iron your letter.,
Using a flat blade, break the seal.",How to Steam Open an Envelope3," An alternative way to steam open an envelope, with less steam, is to use your clothes iron. It works in a similar way, but can be less messy and easier than using a kettle or a stove. Simply heat up your iron as if you were ironing some shirts and get your sealed envelope ready.

, Check the surface is clean with nothing that might mark the envelope. Place your envelope on a surface that will not burn or scorch under a heated iron, an ironing board is ideal. Be sure that you have the side of the envelope with the opening flap and seal facing up towards the iron.

, With the iron on a medium-low temperature, pass it over the envelope backwards and forwards gently pressing down. The heat from the iron will melt the adhesive that holds the envelope's sealing flap down. If the iron temperature is high the glue will melt quicker, but you risk burning or scorching the envelope, so don’t rush it.

, As with the other steaming techniques, once the glue has been melted you can carefully slide a dull knife under the flap and ease the envelope open. It’s best not to use a sharper knife as there is a greater risk of you tearing or damaging the envelope. As always, don’t force it open if it is still sticking, instead give it some more time in the heat.

Wait for the envelope to dry.,
Lick the glue and seal it as normal.,
Re-seal with steam.,
Gently push the sticky strip back down.,
Take it out of the steam and hold it closed.,
Use a little glue.",How to Steam Open an Envelope4," If you are trying to steam open an envelope, you probably want to know how to go about re-sealing it again. First of all wait for the glue melted by the steam to cool and re-gain it's stickiness.

, The first thing to try is simply licking the adhesive strips and closing the envelope as you would normally. The glue should have re-gained it's tackiness and you should be able just press it closed.


Bear in mind that you may have to hold the strip down for a little longer than usual to get it to stick.

, Another way to reseal the envelope is to put the adhesive side of the flap back in the steam briefly. Get your water back to the boil and hold your envelope over the boiling water for around twenty seconds.

, While you hold it over the water, run your finger along the adhesive strip to close it down. Be careful not to crease it or allow too much stream to wet the envelope.

, Now remove the envelope from above the water and place down on a table or surface and apply pressure to the adhesive strip. You may have to hold it down for thirty seconds or so, or you could put something heavy like a book on top of it. Soon it should be re-seal and ready to go.


If it does not all reseal on the first try put it back in the steam briefly and press it together lightly. Make sure not to rub the envelope, because when it is damp it may rub and tear.

, If all else fails, don’t panic! You can use some Elmer's glue, but make sure that you spread it around very well so that it looks like a normal envelope. You don't want to have some areas with glue marks staining the envelope, or soggy gluey patches. A light even covering should do the trick.

,How to Calculate Slope and Intercepts of a Line1,
"
 Pick two points on the line.,
Determine the rise between the two points.,
Determine the run between the two points.,
Make a ratio using the rise over the run to determine the slope.",How to Calculate Slope and Intercepts of a Line2," Draw dots on the graph to represent these points, and note their coordinates.

Remember when graphing points to list the x-coordinate first, then the y-coordinate.

For example, you might choose the points (-3, -2) and (5, 4).
;
, To do this, you must compare the difference in y of the two points. Begin with the first point, the point that is the farthest left on the graph, and count up until you reach the y-coordinate of the second point.

The rise can be positive or negative; that is, you can count up or down to find it.If the line is moving up and to the right, the rise is positive. If the line is moving down and to the right, the rise is negative. For example, if the y-coordinate of the first point is (-2), and the y-coordinate of the second point is (4), you will count up 6 points, so your rise is 6.


, To do this, you must compare the difference in x of the two points. Begin with the first point, the point that is farthest left on the graph, and count over until you reach the x-coordinate of the second point.

To run is always positive; that is, you can only count from left to right, never right to left. For example, if the x-coordinate of the first point is (-3), and the x-coordinate of the second point is (5), you will count over 8, so your run is 8.


, The slope is usually in fraction form, but it can also be a whole number.

For example, if the rise is 6 and the run is 8, then your slope is 68{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{8}}}, which can be simplified to 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}.

Set up the formula m=y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}.,
Plug the x- and y-coordinates into the formula.,
Complete the calculation and simplify, if possible.",How to Calculate Slope and Intercepts of a Line3," In the formula, m = the slope, (x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} = the coordinates of the first point, (x2,y2){\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})} = the coordinates of the second point.

Remember that the slope is equal to riserun{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}}. You are using this formula to find the change in y (rise) over the change in x (run). , Make sure you place the coordinates of the first point ((x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})}) and the second point ((x2,y2){\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})}) in the correct positions in the formula, or else you will not calculate the correct slope.

For example, given the points (-3, -2) and (5, 4), your formula will look like this: m=4−(−2)5−(−3){\displaystyle m={\frac {4-(-2)}{5-(-3)}}}.


, This will give you the slope as a fraction or whole number.

For example, if your slope is m=4−(−2)5−(−3){\displaystyle m={\frac {4-(-2)}{5-(-3)}}}you should calculate 4−(−2)=6{\displaystyle 4-(-2)=6} in the numerator (Remember when subtracting a negative number, you add.) and 5−(−3)=8{\displaystyle 5-(-3)=8} in the denominator. You can simplify 68{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{8}}} to 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, so m=34{\displaystyle m={\frac {3}{4}}}.

Check your work.",How to Calculate Slope and Intercepts of a Line4," In the formula, y = the y-coordinate of any point on the line, m = slope, x = the x-coordinate of any point on the line, and b = the y-intercept.


y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b} is the equation of a line. The y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis.


, Remember, the slope is equal to the rise over the run. If you need help finding the slope, see the instructions above.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and on point on the line is (5,4), then the formula will look like this: 4=34(5)+b{\displaystyle 4={\frac {3}{4}}(5)+b}.


, First multiply the slope and the x-coordinate. Subtract this number from both sides to solve for b.

In the example problem the equation becomes 4=334+b{\displaystyle 4=3{\frac {3}{4}}+b}. Subtracting 334{\displaystyle 3{\frac {3}{4}}} from both sides, you end up with 14=b{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}=b}. So the y-intercept is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}.


, On a coordinate graph, plot your known point, then draw a line using the slope. To find the y-intercept, look for the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and one point is (5,4), draw a point at (5,4), then draw other points along the line by counting to the left 3 and down 4. When you draw a line through the points, you should see the line cross the y-axis just above the (0,0) coordinate.

",How to Calculate Slope and Intercepts of a Line5," In the formula, y = the y-coordinate of any point on the line, m = slope, x = the x-coordinate of any point on the line, and b = the y-intercept.


y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b} is the equation of a line. The x-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the x-axis.


, Remember, the slope is equal to the rise over the run. If you need help finding the slope, see the instructions above.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and the y-intercept is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, the formula will look like this: y=34x+14{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{4}}x+{\frac {1}{4}}}.


, You are looking for the x-intercept, the point at which the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate will equal zero. So if we set y to 0, and solve for the corresponding x-coordinate, we will find the point (x, 0), which will be the x-intercept.

In the example problem, the equation becomes 0=34x+14{\displaystyle 0={\frac {3}{4}}x+{\frac {1}{4}}}.


, First subtract the y-intercept from both sides. Then divide both sides by the slope.

In the example problem the equation becomes −14=34x{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{4}}={\frac {3}{4}}x}. Dividing both sides by 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, you end up with −412=x{\displaystyle {\frac {-4}{12}}=x}. This simplifies to −13=x{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{3}}=x}. So the point at which the line crosses the x-axis is (−13,0){\displaystyle ({\frac {-1}{3}},0)}. So the x-intercept is −13{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{3}}}.


, On a coordinate graph, plot your y-intercept, then draw a line using the slope. To find the x-intercept, look for the point where the line crosses the x-axis.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and the y-intercept is (0,14){\displaystyle (0,{\frac {1}{4}})}, draw a point at (0,14){\displaystyle (0,{\frac {1}{4}})}, then draw other points along the line by counting to the left 3 and down 4, and to the right 3 and up 4. When you draw a line through the points, you should see the line cross the x-axis just left of the (0,0) coordinate.

Divide the hexagon into six congruent, equilateral triangles.To do this, draw a line connecting each vertex, or point, with the vertex opposite.

,
Choose one triangle and label the length of its base.,
Create two right triangles.,
Set up the formula for the Pythagorean Theorem.,
Plug the length of the right triangle’s base into the formula.,
Plug the length of the hypotenuse into the formula.,
Square the known values in the formula.,
Isolate the unknown variable.,
Solve for a{\displaystyle a}.",How to Calculate the Apothem of a Hexagon1,", This is equal to the side length of the hexagon.

For example, you might have a hexagon with a side length of 8 cm. The base of each equilateral triangle, then, is also 8 cm.


, To do this, draw a line from the top vertex of the equilateral triangle perpendicular to its base. This line will cut the base of the triangle in half (and thus is the apothem of the hexagon). Label the length of the base of one of the right triangles.

For example, if the base of the equilateral triangle is 8 cm, when you divide the triangle into two right triangles, each right triangle now has a base of 4 cm.


, The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.

For example, if a right triangle had a hypotenuse of 2{\displaystyle 2} inches, one leg of 1{\displaystyle 1} inch, and another leg of of about 1.732{\displaystyle 1.732} inches (3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}}), the Pythagorean Theorem would state that 12+32=22{\displaystyle 1^{2}+{\sqrt {3}}^{2}=2^{2}}, which is true when you complete the calculations: 1+3=4{\displaystyle 1+3=4}.


, Substitute for b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the length of the base is 4 cm, your formula will look like this: a2+42=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}.


, You know the length of the hypotenuse because you know the side length of the hexagon. The side length of a regular hexagon is equal to the radius of the hexagon.The radius is a line that connects the central point of a polygon with one of its vertices.You’ll note that the hypotenuse of your right triangle is also a radius of the hexagon, thus, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.

For example, if the side length of the hexagon is 8 cm, then the length of the right triangle’s hypotenuse is also 8 cm. So your formula will look like this: a2+42=82{\displaystyle a^{2}+4^{2}=8^{2}}.


, Remember that squaring a number means to multiply it by itself.

For example, squaring the known values, your formula will look like this: a2+16=64{\displaystyle a^{2}+16=64}.


, To do this, subtract the squared value of b{\displaystyle b} from both sides of the equation.

For example:a2+16−16=64−16{\displaystyle a^{2}+16-16=64-16}a2=48{\displaystyle a^{2}=48}


, To do this, find the square root of each side of the equation. This will give you the length of the missing side of the triangle, which is equal to the length of the hexagon’s apothem.

For example, using a calculator, you can calculate 48=6.93{\displaystyle {\sqrt {48}}=6.93}. Thus, the missing length of the right triangle, and the length of the hexagon’s apothem, equals 6.93 cm.

When given an expected value, subtract the value you got from the expected value to get the Absolute Error.,
Alternatively, when measuring something, assume the absolute error to be the smallest unit of measurement at your disposal.,
Always add the appropriate units.,
Practice with several examples.,
Understand what causes error, and how you can work to eliminate it.",How to Calculate Relative Error1," An expected value is usually found on tests and school labs. Basically, this is the most precise, common measurement to come up with, usually for common equations or reactions. You can compare your own results to get Absolute Error, which measures how far off you were from the expected results. To do so, simply subtract the measured value from the expected one. Even if the result is negative, make it positive. This is your absolute error!Example: You want to know how accurately you estimate distances by pacing them off. You pace from one tree to another and estimate that they're 18 feet apart. This is the experimental value. Then you come back with a long measuring tape to measure the exact distance, finding out that the trees are in fact 20 feet (6 meters) apart. That is the ""real"" value. Your absolute error is 20 - 18 = 2 feet (60.96 centimeters).;
, For example, if you're measuring something with a meter stick, the smallest unit marked on the meter stick is 1 millimeter (mm). So you know that your measurement is accurate to within + or - 1 mm; your absolute error is 1 mm.

This works for any measurement system. Many scientific tools, like precision droppers and measurement equipment, often has absolute error labeled on the sides as ""+/- ____ ""


, Say your Absolute Error was ""2 meters."" This tells your viewers exactly how far off your error was. But if you write that your error was simply ""2,"" this doesn't tell your audience anything. Use the same unites as the ones in your measurements., The best way to learn how to calculate error is to go ahead and calculate it. Take a stab at the following problems, then highlight the space after the colon (:) to see your answer.

Jill is studying chemical reactions. After mixing and matching, her test tube contains 32 grams of substrate. The accepted value for her experiment was 34 grams. Her Absolute Error is: +/- 2 grams

Clive is testing reactions in chemistry. It takes 10ml drops of water to cause a reaction, but his dropper claims it is ""+/- .5ml."" The Absolute Error in his measurements must be: +/- .5ml


, No scientific study is ever perfectly error free -- even Nobel Prize winning papers and discoveries have a margin or error attached. Still, understanding where error comes from is essential to help try and prevent it:Human error is the most common. This is from bad measurements, faulty premises, or mistakes in the lab.

Incidental energy/material loss, such as the little fluid left in the beaker after pouring, changes in temperature due to the environment, etc.

Imperfect equipment used either for measurement or studies, such as very small, precise measurements or burners that provide uneven heat."

Shape a pen with polymer clay.,
Use a piece of cane.,
Make a quill pen.",How to Make a Pen1," Take out a pen's ink cartridge and cut a bamboo skewer to the same length. Wipe the skewer with petroleum jelly and use it to pierce a small ball of polymer clay. Roll out the clay until it extends along the whole skewer, seal it over one end, and bake according to clay's label instructions. Let cool 5–10 minutes, remove the skewer, then glue in the ink cartridge once the clay has cooled completely., A thin piece of bamboo is ideal, but any sturdy hollow cane will do. Cut off a cane segment underneath one joint, and just below the next. Drop an ink cartridge from an ordinary pen into the hollow end. Gradually make an angled cut into the solid end, until you can poke through with the ink cartridge tip. Seal the end with clay or putty to prevent ink leaking out.


If the cartridge is too loose, hold it in with strong glue. If it's too long, hold it in place with tape.

, Choose a large tail feather, and trim away enough feathers to comfortably hold the tip. Sand the tip smooth, then cut it away at a steep angle. To let the quill pick up ink, cut a slit from the tip inward, and chop off the extreme tip to make a flat edge.For best results, before you begin cutting, soak the feather in hot water until it bends easily, then harden it again in hot sand."

Put down a layer of corrugated cardboard or other protective material.,
Place your booklet face down over the cardboard.,
Pull the two arms of the stapler apart.,
Align the stapler head over the booklet's center.,
Push down on the stapler head to deploy the staple.,
Lift the booklet carefully and inspect the staple.,
Push the staple prongs down over the paper.,
Repeat with remaining staples.",How to Staple a Booklet1," This method involves stapling your booklet against a soft material, then manually pushing the staples down against the booklet. You may use corrugated cardboard, foam, or any other material soft enough for the staples to dig into without attaching. Only use material you don't mind damaging.


If you have a large number of booklets to staple, you'll probably prefer the Specialized Stapler method.
If you don't have any suitable material and your booklet is thin, try the Two Books method.;
, Make sure all the pages are in order and aligned with each other. The outside cover should be visible, not the inner pages, or you will have more trouble folding the booklet after stapling.

, Grasp the upper arm near the joint, not next to the staple-deploying head. Use your other hand to hold down the base, and pull up on the arm. The two sections of the stapler should swing apart.

, The center of the booklet should receive 2–4 evenly spaced staples to form the spine, depending on how large the booklet is and how sturdy you would like it to be. Each staple should run in the same direction as the spine (vertical when the finished booklet is held for reading), so you can fold the sheets of paper in half around the staples without tearing them. Align your stapler head according to these guidelines.

, Because you are stapling the paper against corrugated cardboard or other soft material, you may not hear the distinctive stapler sound you're used to. Push down firmly, then release and pick up the stapler.

, Most likely, the staple is partially attached to the cardboard beneath. Lifting the booklet slowly and gently should pull the two prongs of the staple out of the cardboard, but you may need to bend the staple straight with your finger before pulling.


If the staple is firmly attached to the material, the material is too thin to use for this purpose. Detach the staple with a staple remover, then try again with thicker, corrugated cardboard.

, After detaching the staple from the material beneath, you should see the two prongs poking through the paper, but not folded down. Fold these down toward each other along the spine's length. You may use your fingers, approaching carefully from the side to avoid the sharp point, or lay the paper flat and gently hammer them down with any hard object.

, Place the booklet over the cardboard again and align the stapler head over the next portion of the spine to be stapled. Try to line up the staples as evenly as possible.

Press down firmly and quickly on the top of the stapler.,
Check to make sure that the staple has bound the papers.,
Unjam the stapler, if necessary.,
Open the stapler.,
Hold up the paper you are trying to staple.,
Push the stapler ejection gap firmly down on the part of the paper you want to tack.",How to Use a Stapler," Most staples are top load staplers. To open these, grip the base of the stapler, then pull the top of the stapler until it lifts open and the staple tray is revealed. Back load staplers usually have a button on the back, so to open these, push the button until the stapler tray pops out slightly. Then, pull on the staple tray until it is fully extended.


Electric staplers will also have a release button on the back.
Hold the base steady when opening a stapler.
Some models may vary, but in general, you can open a stapler by pulling it open or by pushing a back button.;
, Insert the recommended staples, placing the pointy legs first into the staple tray. To close top load staplers, push the top of the stapler down until it clicks into place. For back load staplers, push the stapler tray in to close it.








, This is the amount most manual desktop and electric staplers can bind, but heavy-duty staplers can handle up to 100 or more pieces.Be sure your papers are all facing the same way and are in the order you want to bind them in.

, The staple is going to come out of the stapler ejection gap (located at the very end of the stapler tray), so place the part you want to staple under it.


If you are using an electronic stapler, the staple will shoot out immediately.
If the electronic stapler does not shoot the stapler out immediately, push your papers further back, and be sure it is plugged in.
You will hear electronic staplers “click” when the papers are bound.

, Then, let go of the stapler’s top, and your papers should be bound.








, You can remove the staple if it is not in the location you wanted, if it is loose, or if it is bent. Pry open the staple legs, then pull the staple out, and try stapling it again.

, Staplers often jam if you try to staple too many papers or if a staple bends in an unexpected way. Open up the stapler, and use tweezers, pliers, or a similar tool to pull out any jammed staples. Unplug electronic staplers before fixing any jams.







, Hold the base of the stapler firmly in one hand, then pull back the top of the stapler where the staple tray is.Other stapler models include a silver tab on the bottom of the stapler, toward the back. Press it, and the stapler will automatically pop open, enabling you to use it for tacking purposes.









Let the base hang as you use the stapler tray end for tacking.
Do not use electronic staplers for tacking.

, You may need to ask a friend for help since you do not want to tack a crooked piece of paper to the wall, and using the stapler to tack will require two hands. Tape the paper in place while you staple it if a friend cannot help you hold it.

, You will hear the staple enter the wall. Repeat this tacking process as necessary. If the tacking function is not working, do not force it. Your walls may simply be too thick for staples, and you will have to use screws or hooks.

If you’re feeling adventurous, reshape your paper clip into a heart-shaped holder. It’ll lend a little love and excitement to your bundles.;
, If the bottom edge of your skirt or pants is coming undone, paper clips make for an excellent temporary fix. Just fold the rough edge under and pin it in place by securing paper clips around the circumference.


This is also a useful way to prepare a hem to resew it. Using paper clips around the edge will help ensure that your hem is even all the way around.

, It’s really difficult to zip and unzip clothing when there’s nothing to hang onto. If you’re missing the pull for a zipper, simply loop a paper clip through the eyelet where the original pull was attached., If you unbend a paper clip, its ends can be very useful for clearing up household items that are stopped up. The paper clip is an especially useful tool when the job calls for precision, such as fine drains or clogged glue bottles.

, Some small items, like jewelry or electronics, are difficult to clean using your hands. If you loop some tissue, paper towel, gauze, felt, or cotton around a paper clip, it can create a mini cleaning tool that’s perfect for dusting hard-to-reach crevices.

, When you need to reset your modem or router, a paper clip is the ideal tool for pressing that tricky-to-reach reset button. Bend it into a key-like shape, that is, a long wire with a handle at the end. You hold the handle and use the extended wire to press in the internal reset button., A paper clip can serve as a simple bookmark. Just clip it to the page you are on in whatever you’re reading, and you won’t lose your spot.

, You can either hang an object using the paper clip alone or hang it from a string tied to the paper clip with the object on it if you’d like a longer loop.


This is an easy and cheap way to hang everything from ornaments to strings of lights to wall decor. Just be sure that whatever you’re hanging is light enough that it won’t break the paper clip with its weight.
You can even reshape the paper clip into a miniature clothes hanger.

, If you’re constantly annoyed about losing where you are in a roll of duct, scotch, or painters’ tape, why not wrap the edge around a paper clip to create an easy tab. The end will not only be easy-to-find, it’ll also be easy to pull when you need it., Lots of items in your cupboard and fridge come in bags. Ensure it all stays fresh by using a paper clip to seal each package.You can either fold the open edge of a bag over and clip it closed or unbend your paper clip to use it like a twisty tie.

, This is definitely not advice to do anything illegal, but sometimes you lock yourself out of an old trunk or locker, and paper clips can be quicker and more cost-effective than a locksmith.To open a padlock, you’ll need two paper clips, one unbent to be completely straight and the other bent into an “L” shape.
Insert the straight clip into the very top of the keyhole (where the jagged edge of your key would normally go), and the L-shaped clip into the bottom. Then, you need to swiftly and firmly pull the top clip out while firmly twisting the bottom clip in the same direction as you would your key. It’s tricky to get the action exactly right, so it may take a few tries.

Set up the formula for finding the apothem of a regular polygon.,
Plug the side length into the formula.,
Plug the number of sides into the formula.,
Complete the calculation in parentheses.,
Find the tangent.,
Multiply the tangent by 2, then divide the side length by this number.",How to Calculate the Apothem of a Hexagon2," The formula is apothem=s2tan⁡(180n){\displaystyle {\text{apothem}}={\frac {s}{2\tan({\frac {180}{n}})}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the side length of the polygon and n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of sides the polygon has., Remember to substitute for the variable s{\displaystyle s}.

For example, for a hexagon with a side length of 8 cm, the formula will look like this: 82tan⁡(180n){\displaystyle {\frac {8}{2\tan({\frac {180}{n}})}}}.


, A hexagon has 6 sides. Remember to substitute for the variable n{\displaystyle n}.

For example: 82tan⁡(1806){\displaystyle {\frac {8}{2\tan({\frac {180}{6}})}}}.


, You are finding the degrees you will use to calculate the tangent.

For example, 1806=30{\displaystyle {\frac {180}{6}}=30}, so the formula now look like this: 82tan⁡(30){\displaystyle {\frac {8}{2\tan(30)}}}.


, To do this, use a calculator or a trigonometry table.For example, the tangent of 30 is about .577, so the formula will now look like this: 82(.577){\displaystyle {\frac {8}{2(.577)}}}.


, This will give you the length of the apothem of your hexagon.

For example:apothem=82(.577){\displaystyle {\text{apothem}}={\frac {8}{2(.577)}}}apothem=81.154{\displaystyle {\text{apothem}}={\frac {8}{1.154}}}apothem=6.93{\displaystyle {\text{apothem}}=6.93}So, the apothem of a regular hexagon with 8-cm sides is about 6.93 cm.

Divide the Absolute Error by the Actual Value of the item in question to get Relative Error.,
Multiply the answer by 100 to get an easier to understand percentage.,
Calculate Relative Error all at once by turning the numerator (top of fraction) into your Absolute Error equation.,
Always provide units as context.",How to Calculate Relative Error2," The result is the relative error.

Note that in most cases the unit of measurement of the absolute error will be the same as the unit of measurement of the actual value, and the units will cancel each other. This leaves the relative error without any units of measurement. 

This simple equation tells you how far off you were in comparison to the overall measurement. A low relative error is, of course, desirable. To continue the example of measuring between two trees:

Your Absolute Error was 2 feet, and the Actual Value was 20 feet.


2ft20ft{\displaystyle {\frac {2ft}{20ft}}}


Relative Error =.1{\displaystyle =.1}, Leave the relative error in fraction form, complete the division to render it in decimal form, or multiply the resulting decimal form by 100 to render your answer as a percentage. This tells you what percentage of the final measurement you messed up by. If you are measuring a 200 foot boat, and miss the measurement by 2 feet, your percentage error will be much lower than missing the 20 foot tree measurement by 2 feet. The error is a smaller percentage of the total measurement.2ft20ft=.1{\displaystyle {\frac {2ft}{20ft}}=.1}


.1∗100=10%{\displaystyle .1*100=10\%} Relative Error.


, Once you understand the difference between Absolute and Relative Error, there is really no reason to do everything all by itself. Simply substitute the equation for Absolute Error in for the actual number. Note that the vertical bars are absolute value signs, meaning anything within them must be positive.


Relative Error =|Measured−Actual|Actual{\displaystyle ={\frac {|{\mathrm {Measured} }-{\mathrm {Actual} }|}{\mathrm {Actual} }}}

Multiply the whole thing by 100 to get Relative Error Percentage all at once., Let the audience know the units you're using for measurement. However, the relative error does not employ units of measurement. It is expressed as a fraction or a percentage, such as a relative error of 10%. "

Assemble the pen.",How to Make a Pen2," You'll most likely have to place an online order, as these are difficult to find even in craft stores. These include the ink cartridge and metal pieces.


See the Things You'll Need section below for additional tools before you buy. The same source may be able to sell you those tools.
This guide will work for any type of pen kit. Rollerball pens are slightly easier to assemble, but twist pen kits are usually the cheapest option., A pen blank is just a rectangular block with a hole drilled through the center, usually made from wood or Corian. You can practice on homemade scrap lumber blanks, then move on to pre-cut blanks with more attractive wood and ""stabilized"" treatment for a better fit.


Line up the two brass tubes from your pen kit. Cut the blank a bit longer than this length. The other dimensions don't matter, as long as the blank is significantly larger than the desired pen size. A 5"" x ½"" x ½"" (12.75 x 1.25 x 1.25 cm) blank should fit most pen kits., Line up the brass tubes next to your blank. Cut the blank into segments, each one slightly longer than a single brass tube.


Most pen kits come with two brass tubes, but some use three. These may be different lengths, so use a different tube for each measurement.
Draw a pencil line across the blanks so you can easily line up the grain., If you cut your own blank, hold each part in a drill press and drill through the center. The drill bit must match the outer diameter of the brass tubes in your pen kit. Drill slowly, in ½"" (1.25 cm) increments, to avoid fracturing the material.Set the drill press' depth stop so the point just barely touches the opposite side. If it emerges fully, it will often ""blow out"" the whole blank, making you start again.Saw off the tip of the blank so the hole goes straight through.


The most common sizes are 7mm (roughly J bit or 9/32"") and 8mm (roughly O or 5/16"").If using imperial drill bits, you may want to test on scrap wood first to find the best fit. A slightly loose fit should turn out fine if you use extra glue., Scuff the exterior of the brass tubes with rough sandpaper, about 120 grit.Optionally, plug the end with Play-Do or dental wax to avoid getting glue inside the tube.Apply glue and stick each brass tube into the blank of the same length. Wear gloves to minimize cleanup.


Cyanoacrylate (CA) glue and 5-minute epoxy are popular choices.If you use polyurethane glue, wait until the final stage, when you're ready to assemble. This glue foams up as it cures, which can ruin the fit. (This is a possibility with all glues, but most pen makers prefer the convenience of gluing at this stage instead of leaving the tubes loose.), Wait for the glue to cure, according to the glue's label instructions. Fit the pen mill rod into one of the tubes, and turn clockwise so the cutting edge squares the end. Repeat with each end of each blank, until every surface is flush with the end of the brass tube.


Now's a good time to check the inside of the tubes for glue. Scrape it out using any tool.
You can use a sanding jig instead, but it may take quite a bit of setup., Line up the pen blanks in the order they fit together, on the mandrel rod. Place a bushing in between them, and another bushing on either end. Fit the two ends of the mandrel to hold the pen in place.


Check the kit instructions for recommended bushing size.
If you really don't want to buy the pen mandrel you can mount each blank separately on a 60º live center instead.Shaping each piece separately will be much harder for a beginner, however.

, Mount the mandrel onto your lathe. Shape the blank down to the diameter of the bushings, using gouges, skews, or any other lathe turning tools. Stop the lathe after the initial rough shaping, and loosen the mandrel nut and tailstock before you continue. These usually tighten during turning, which can lead to misshapen pens.Continue turning until you've achieved any shape you like.


If you don't have a lathe, mount a sanding drum onto your drill press and hold the blank against it.You'll have much less control, but no one wants to buy a $300 lathe for a $2 pen.

, Remove the pen from the lathe. Sand the blanks with dry, 220 grit sandpaper. Repeat with 320, 400, and 600 grit to get a progressively smoother surface.


There are plenty of variations on this exact sanding process, so don't feel that you have to use these exact grits. High-quality pens may be sanded up to 1200 grit at this stage, using mesh abrasive cloths., You can use any film finish, lacquer, or wood polish to give the pen a glossy, protective coating.Complete the blank by wetting it and sanding with finer grit sandpaper. Try polishing with 400 grit, 600, 800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2400, 3200, 3600, and 4000 (using abrasive meshes for the highest grits).This can get a little tedious, but this is the bare minimum of sanding most pen-makers use. Some go as high as 12,000.Rub on paste wax for a shinier pen., Your pen kit should include instructions for which pen components attach to which blanks. Use a pen assembly press or a simple bench vise to press on each metal component. Once all parts are firmly pressed on, your pen is complete. Here's a typical process for a twisting pen:Press the pen cap into the upper brass tube.
Press the twisting mechanism into the lower tube. Before you press, lay the mechanism next to the blank, and twist to extend the tip. Note how far you'll have to press it in order for the tip to just barely protrude.
Press the pen clip and cap onto the upper blank.

Use this method to staple thin booklets.,
Place two large books next to each other.,
Lay your stack of paper face down over the books, with the center over the gap.,
Pull the two arms of the stapler apart.,
Hold the paper in place and align the top arm over the spine.,
Push down on the stapler head swiftly.,
Bend down the staple prongs.,
Repeat with remaining staples.",How to Staple a Booklet2," This method requires no specialized materials, but it is only suitable for thin booklets made from a few sheets of paper. Your stapler needs to be powerful enough to deploy a staple through the booklet when there is no supporting surface behind it, so do not use a stapler that is rusty or jams easily.


If you have a large number of booklets to staple, you may wish to save effort by using the Specialized Stapler method.

, Select two books that are exactly the same height when laid flat on a table. Place them flat on a table or other hard surface, leaving a tiny gap between them. The gap only needs to be wide enough to staple the booklet over it without attaching the staple to the book; 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25–2.5cm) should be plenty.

, Make sure all your pages are in order and aligned, then lay the stack of paper over the two books. The center of the outside cover should be directly over the gap.

, Pull the arms of the stapler apart. If only the cover comes off (revealing the staples), put it back and on and try again while holding the sides of the upper arm more firmly.

, Hold the booklet in place with your hands or by placing a heavy object on top of each side. Align the stapler arm so the head of the stapler is oriented in the middle of the booklet, where you'd like the first staple to be. Depending on how large the booklet is, you will probably want somewhere between 2 and 4 staples, spaced evenly down the spine.

, Because there is nothing but air underneath the spine, you will have to push down quickly to get the staple to deploy. Hold the paper in place as you do this to make sure it is not dragged down with the stapler. Do not push so hard that the paper tears; the motion should be firm but over quickly.

, Pick up the stack of paper and see if the staple went through the paper. If it did, all you need to do is bend the two prongs of the staple flat against the paper, pointed toward each other. You may do this with your fingers, avoiding the sharp point, or by gently hammering them down with any hard object.


If the staple did not pierce through the whole stack of paper, your stapler may not be strong enough for this method, or you may not have pushed hard enough. Try again after pushing the two books closer together, and make sure the paper is held down firmly when you apply the staple.

, Continue until the spine has enough staples to hold the paper in place firmly when folded to form a booklet. 3 is enough for most projects, while a particularly thick or tall booklet may require 4 or more staples.

"
"
Purchase a centerline or rotating-head stapler.,
Assemble your booklet.,
Decide how many staples are required down the spine of the booklet.,
Position your booklet with the outside cover facing upwards.,
Push the stapler arm down on the spine where you want to place each staple.,
Check that all staples have been properly inserted and sit flat.",How to Staple a Booklet3," If you staple booklets together frequently, it may be worth investing in one of these two specialized stapler varieties. Centerline staplers are simply oversized staplers which can reach the booklet spine from the correct direction to orient a staple. Rotating-head staplers are shorter, but have a stapler arm that can rotate to apply the staple with the correct orientation. Either variety is suitable for booklets.


Centerline staplers are sometimes referred to as booklet staplers or long reach staplers.
For centerline staplers, check that the ""throat depth"" can reach across the full width of your booklet's page.
Check the maximum number of sheets the device can staple. Keep in mind this is the number of pieces of paper, not the number of numbered pages in your finished booklet.

, Make sure that all the pages are in order and that the paper is evenly aligned before inserting into the stapler.

, Usually two will suffice (this is standard) but depending on the size of your booklet, one staple may suffice or you may need three or four. If you need more than one or two staples, it can be helpful to make small pencil marks in advance that show you where to position the stapler. With practice, this will likely become easier.

, Place it into the specialized stapler so that the center portion is aligned underneath the stapling mechanism. Make sure the booklet is aligned with the stapler, and that the margins on either side of the stapler are as close to the same width as possible.

, Once the stapler arm is aligned, push down on the end of the upper arm until you hear the staple go through the paper. Repeat the process above to align your stapler on a different place on the spine, and staple until the booklet has as many staples as you choose. Two or three staples are generally enough.

, If any of them failed to puncture the paper, or did not close properly, remove them so you can try again. Do this by carefully unbending each arm of the staple until it is straight, then pushing it out through the hole made by the stapler.

"
"
Keep in mind these instructions are best suited for removing a staple from a stack of paper that has been stapled only at one end and preferably towards one of the corners (usually most people staple the left top corner of the stack).,
Get a rough count of the number of pages in the stack.

,
Separate the stack into two stacks, starting at the bottom end of the stack.,
Hold the two stacks of paper, one in each hand while they are connected to each other by the staple.

,
Move your hands towards the crevice formed by the two stacks of paper joined together by the staple.

,
Insert both your thumbs into the crevice (each thumb approaching the deepest part of the crevice from each side) and with slow,controlled force try to pull the two stacks apart.,
If you do this right, you will feel a slight give as the staple ends begin to straighten out.

,
At this point you can increase the force you apply to complete the process.,
To remove the right half of the staple you can insert a pencil or some other sharp instrument under the staple on the topside of the stack and lift the staple.",How to Remove Staples with Your Bare Hands," This technique works best with a stack containing between ten and 50 pages.;
,, Gently peel the top stack from the bottom stack until you can no longer peel the stacks without applying substantial force and/or ripping the stacks apart.

,,, This will loosen the joint and allows for the sharply turned ends of the staple to become more rounded and ultimately straighten out.

,, Some of the pages in your left hand (for a right-handed person) will fall off of the staple and you can ease the left stack off of the pin.

, If you have have long fingernails you can lift it easily with your nails.

Make a charm or pendant.,
Make a ring.,
Create a wind-chime or a mobile.,
Build a sculpture.,
Dye eggs.,
Make an ornament.,
Use it as florist wire.",How to Use a Paper Clip in Many Ways2," If you wrap a paper clip twice around a cylindrical object, like a marker, it can serve as the base for a key ring. Make it more exciting by attaching homemade decorations like ribbons, beads, or origami.Be sure that you're using a paper clip made from a substantial wire that it can hold the weight of your key(s).
You should also be sure that the two loops of wire are as tight or close together as possible so that your key will not slip off. If you are worried about losing your key, twist the two ends of your paper clip around the loops a few times to prevent them from opening up.

, Use craft glue to attach buttons, cloth flowers, felted shapes, googly eyes, or other small decorations to the end of a jumbo paper clip. After your creations are thoroughly dried, slip the non-decorated side over the top of a page to mark your spot in style.You can also add colorful flare and help mark your spot by tying a tassel to the end made from knotting together a bundle of ribbon, string, or sewing floss.

, Connect many paper clips together creatively to fashion colorful adornments for your neck and wrists.The easiest style is a chain necklace or bracelet made from linking together multiple clips to achieve the length you want. Either attach the open ends together or twist together your clips into interlocking spirals.
Experiment by making long necklaces and bracelets with multiple loops of different colors.
Try decorating your jewelry with beads, ribbons, colorful paper wrapped around each clip with glue, or whatever else strikes your fancy!

, You can also try making a charm to attach to a bracelet or pendant for the end of a necklace by reshaping the paper clip into a different shape. If you twist the ends of the paper clip together, you can even add beads to decorate your design. Or, make a shape like a heart and then wind ribbon or colored string around it., You can make a ring with as little as a single clip. Either loop it around your finger of choice as many times as you can, or loop it once, twist the two ends together to form the size of ring you want, and bend the remaining length of wire into a shape of your choosing.

, Attach multiple paper clips together to form a chain, then hang a bell or other objects, like a small stuffed animal or wooden ornament, from it. Use your craft to decorate a child’s room or string it up outside to make music in the wind.

, The bendable wire of a paper clip makes a great building block for imaginative art. Unbend your paper clips before reshaping them into whatever your imagination desires. Twist paper clips together to create any size of structure.Try using multicolored paper clips to introduce multiple hues into your sculpture. Doing so can make it more vibrant or help you better represent the object you’re portraying, like a flower with red petals and green leaves.

, Use a paper clip to hold your Easter eggs securely as you dip them into dye. Simply twist it into a spoon-like shape with a circle that’s big enough to hold your egg stable., Reshape paper clips into fun shapes to hang up around the house or on Christmas trees. Attach some twine, string or ribbon to your paper-clip creation, and it’s ready to go.


Try out designs that take advantage of the typical shape of a paper clip. For instance, the shape of the paper clip works really well to form the body and wings of an angel with a bead for a head.It also lends itself perfectly to being the blades on a pair of ice skates cut out from paper or felt.Paper clips are likewise ideal for attaching ornaments to ribbons so that they can be easily hung up for display.

, There’s to need to purchase a roll of specialty wire when you can just as easily tie together bouquets and fasten flowers to wreaths using paper clips. Just unbend the clips and twist them around bunches of stems to hold your artful arrangements in place."

Learn the standard covariance formula and its parts.,
Set up your data table.,

Calculate the products for each data row.,
Find the sum of the values in the last column.,
Calculate the denominator for the covariance formula.,
Divide the numerator by the denominator.",How to Calculate Covariance1," The standard formula for calculating covariance is Σ(xi−xavg)(yi−yavg)/(n−1){\displaystyle \Sigma (x_{i}-x_{\text{avg}})(y_{i}-y_{\text{avg}})/(n-1)}. To use this formula, you need to understand the meaning of the variables and symbols:Σ{\displaystyle \Sigma } - This symbol is the Greek letter “sigma.” In math functions it means to add up a series of whatever follows it. In this formula, the Σ sign means that you will calculate the values that follow in the numerator of the fraction, and add them all together, before dividing by the denominator.xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - This variable is read as “x sub i.” The i subscript represents a counter. It means that you will perform the calculation for each value of x that you have in your data set. 


xavg{\displaystyle x_{avg}} - The “avg” indicates that x(avg) is the average value of all of your x data points. The average is sometimes also written as an x with a short horizontal line drawn over it. In that style, the variable is read as “x-bar,” but it still means the average of the data set.


yi{\displaystyle y_{i}} - This variable is read as “y sub i.” The i subscript represents a counter. It means that you will perform the calculation for each value of y that you have in your data set.


yavg{\displaystyle y_{avg}} - The “avg” indicates that y(avg) is the average value of all of your y data points. The average is sometimes also written as a y with a short horizontal line drawn over it. In that style, the variable is read as “y-bar,” but it still means the average of the data set.


n{\displaystyle n} - This variable represents the number of items in your data set. Remember that for a covariance problem, a single “item” is comprised of both an x-value and a y-value. The value of n is the number of pairs of data points, not individual numbers.
;
, Before you begin working, it is helpful to collect your data. You should make a table that consists of five columns. You should label each column as follows:


x{\displaystyle x} - fill this column with the values of your x-data points.


y{\displaystyle y} - fill this column with the values of your y-data points. Be careful to align the y-values with the corresponding x-values. In a covariance problem, the order of the data points and the pairings of x and y are important.


(xi−xavg){\displaystyle (x_{i}-x_{\text{avg}})} - Leave this column blank in the beginning. You will fill it with data after you calculate the average of the x-data points.


(yi−yavg){\displaystyle (y_{i}-y_{\text{avg}})} - Leave this column blank in the beginning. You will fill it with data after you calculate the average of the y-data points.


Product{\displaystyle {\text{Product}}} - Leave this final column blank as well. You will fill it as you go along.


, This sample data set contains 9 numbers. To find the average, add them together and divide the sum by 9. This gives you the result of 1+3+2+5+8+7+12+2+4=44. When you divide by 9, the average is 4.89. This is the value that you will use as x(avg) for the coming calculations., Similarly, the y-column should consist of 9 data points that coincide with the x-data points. Find the average of these. For this sample data set, this will be 8+6+9+4+3+3+2+7+7=49. Divide this sum by 9 to get an average of 5.44. You will use 5.44 as the value of y(avg) for the coming calculations., For each item in the x column, you need to find the difference between that number and the average value. For this sample problem, this means subtracting 4.89 from each x-data point. If the original data point is less than the average, then your result will be negative. If the original data point is greater than the average, then your result will be positive. Make sure that you keep track of the negative signs.For example, the first data point in the x column is 1. The value to enter on the first line of the (xi−xavg){\displaystyle (x_{i}-x_{\text{avg}})} column is 1-4.89, which is -3.89.

Repeat the process for each data point. Therefore, the second line will be 3-4.89, which is -1.89. The third line will be 2-4.89, or -2.89. Continue the process for all the data points. The nine numbers in this column should be -3.89, -1.89, -2.89, 0.11, 3.11, 2.11, 7.11, -2.89, -0.89.


, In this column, you will perform similar subtractions, using the y-data points and the y average. If the original data point is less than the average, then your result will be negative. If the original data point is greater than the average, then your result will be positive. Make sure that you keep track of the negative signs.For the first line, therefore, your calculation will be 8-5.44, which is 2.56.

The second line will be 6-5.44, which is 0.56.

Continue these subtractions to the end of the data list. When you finish, the nine values in this column should be 2.56, 0.56, 3.56, -1.44, -2.44, -2.44, -3.44, 1.56, 1.56.


, You will fill in the rows of the final column by multiplying the numbers that you calculated in the two previous columns of (xi−xavg){\displaystyle (x_{i}-x_{\text{avg}})} and (yi−yavg){\displaystyle (y_{i}-y_{\text{avg}})}. Be careful to work row by row, and multiply the two numbers for the corresponding data points. Keep track of any negative signs as you go.On the first row of this data sample, the (xi−xavg){\displaystyle (x_{i}-x_{\text{avg}})} that you calculated is -3.89, and the (yi−yavg){\displaystyle (y_{i}-y_{\text{avg}})} value is 2.56. The product of these two numbers is -3.89*2.56=-9.96.

For the second row, you will multiply the two numbers -1.88*0.56=-1.06.

Continue multiplying row by row to the end of the data set. When you finish, the nine values in this column should be -9.96, -1.06, -10.29, -0.16, -7.59, -5.15, -24.46, -4.51, -1.39.


, This is where the Σ symbol comes into play. After conducting all the calculations that you have done so far, you will add the results. For this sample data set, you should have nine values in the final column. Add those nine numbers together. Pay careful attention to whether each number is positive or negative.

For this sample data set, the sum should be -64.57. Write this total in the space at the bottom of the column. This represents the value of the numerator of the standard covariance formula.


, The numerator for the standard covariance formula is the value that you have just completed calculating. The denominator is represented by (n-1), which is just one less than the number of data pairs in your data set.

For this sample problem, there are nine data pairs, so n is 9. The value of (n-1), therefore, is 8.


, The final step in calculating the covariance is to divide your numerator, Σ(xi−xavg)(yi−yavg){\displaystyle \Sigma (x_{i}-x_{\text{avg}})(y_{i}-y_{\text{avg}})} by your denominator, (n−1){\displaystyle (n-1)}. The quotient is the covariance of your data.For this sample data set, this calculation is -64.57/8, which gives the result of -8.07.

Recall the previous price of an item.,
Check the item's current price.,
Research historical cost information.,
Locate modern cost figures.",How to Calculate Cost Increase Percentage1," The simplest way to locate previous cost data is with your own memory. Perhaps there is some item at the grocery store or shopping mall that you've been buying for years at the same price. This could be a staple of your weekly grocery shopping trips or a clothing item you buy regularly. For example, imagine that the price of a gallon of milk has been $2.50 for a number of years. This represents the previous price for the purpose of your cost increase calculation.

, If the price of an item you've purchased in the past has increased, you can now calculate a cost increase percentage for the item. However, you will need the item's current cost first. Check the store for the current price of the item in question. For example, imagine that a gallon of milk, that has always gone for $2.50, is now priced at $3.50. You can now calculate the cost increase percentage to know just how much you are being charged at the new price in relation to the old price.

Before comparing, make sure both values (your previous and current values) refer to the same product. If one is better in some way, your costs are not directly comparable., In some cases, locating previous cost information is not as simple as remembering the former cost of an item. For example, when comparing costs from long ago to now or finding cost increases on an item you've never purchased you'll need to locate cost information elsewhere. The same is true for cost measures (rather than items), such as the consumer price index (CPI), a measure of average consumer prices in the U.S., or the purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar.In these cases, you will need to do some online research to locate previous cost figures. Try typing in the item and year you are interested in, along with ""cost"" or ""value,"" to locate cost information for that time.

For example, cost information for various consumer goods from 1900 until the present can be found at http://mclib.info/reference/local-history-genealogy/historic-prices/.


, For all historical cost information you locate, you will also need a modern figure to compare it with. Try to locate the closest modern version of whatever item or measure you are comparing. Make sure to avoid comparing items that are different due to different levels of quality or additional features, for example. Use the most current information from the current year in your calculations."

Find the covariance.",How to Calculate Covariance2," Covariance is a calculation that you should perform a few times by hand, so you understand the meaning of the result. However, if you are going to be using covariance values routinely in interpreting data, you will want to find a faster and more automated way to get your results. You should notice by now that for our relatively small data set of only nine pairs of data, the calculations included finding two averages, performing eighteen individual subtractions, nine separate multiplications, one addition, and a final division. That is 31 relatively minor calculations in order to find one solution. Along the way, you risk dropping negative signs or copying your results incorrectly, thereby ruining the result.
, If you are comfortable using Excel (or some other spreadsheet with calculation abilities), you can easily set up a table to find covariance. Label the headings of five columns as for the hand calculations: x, y, (x(i)-x(avg)), (y(i)-y(avg)) and Product.To simplify your labelling, you could call the third column something like “x difference” and the fourth column “y difference,” as long as you remember the meaning of the data.

If you begin your table in the top left corner of the spreadsheet, then cell A1 will be the x label, with the other labels going across to cell E1.


, Enter your data values in the two columns labelled x and y. Remember that the order of the data points matters, so you need to pair each y with its corresponding x value.Your x values will begin in cell A2 and will continue down for as many data points as you need.

Your y values will begin in cell B2 and will continue down for as many data points as you need.


, Excel will calculate the averages for you very quickly. In the first vacant cell below each column of data, enter the formula =AVG(A2:A___). Fill in the blank space with the number of the cell that corresponds to your last data point.For example, if you have 100 data points, they will fill in cells A2 through A101, so you will enter =AVG(A2:A101). 

For the y data, enter the formula =AVG(B2:B101).

Remember that you begin a formula in Excel with an = sign.


, In cell C2, you will need to enter the formula to calculate the first subtraction. This formula will be =A2-____. You will fill in the blank space with the cell address that contains the average of your x data.For the example of 100 data points, the average would be in cell A103, so your formula will be =A2-A103.


, Following the same example, this would go into cell D2. The formula will be =B2-B103., In the fifth column, into cell E2, you will need to enter the formula to calculate the product of the two prior cells. This would simply be =C2*D2., So far, you have only programmed the first pair of data points in row 2. Using your mouse, highlight cells C2, D2 and E2. Then position your cursor over the small box in lower right-hand corner until a plus-sign appears. Click your mouse button, hold it down, and drag the mouse downward to expand the highlighted box to fill your entire data table. This step will automatically copy the three formulas from cells C2, D2 and E2 into the whole table. You should see the table automatically fill with all the calculations., You need to find the sum of the items in the “Product” column. In the vacant cell immediately under the last data point in that column, enter the formula =sum(E2:E___). Fill in the blank space with the cell address of the last data point.For the example of 100 data points, this formula will go into cell E103. You will enter =sum(E2:E102).


, You can have Excel perform the final calculation for you as well. The last calculation, in cell E103 in our example, represents the numerator of the covariance formula. Immediately below that cell, you can enter the formula =E103/___. Fill in the blank space with the number of data points that you have. In our example, this will be 100. The result will be the covariance of your data."

Search the Internet for covariance calculators.,
Enter your data.,
Calculate your results.",How to Calculate Covariance3," Several schools, programming companies or other sources have created websites that will very easily calculate covariance values for you. Using any search engine, enter the search term “covariance calculator.”
, Read the instructions on the website carefully to make sure that you enter your data properly. It is important that your data pairs are kept in order, or you will generate an incorrect covariance result. Different websites have different styles for entering your data.

For example, at the website http://ncalculators.com/statistics/covariance-calculator.htm, there is a horizontal box for entering x-values and a second horizontal box for entering y-values. You are instructed to enter your terms, separated only by commas. Thus, the x-data set that was calculated earlier in this article would be entered as 1,3,2,5,8,7,12,2,4. The y-data set would be 8,6,9,4,3,3,2,7,7.

At another site, https://www.thecalculator.co/math/Covariance-Calculator-705.html, you are prompted to enter your x-data in the first box. Data is entered vertically, with one item per line. Therefore, the entry on this site would look like:

Look for a positive or negative relationship.,
Interpret the magnitude of the covariance.,
Understand a lack of relationship.,
View the relationship graphically.",How to Calculate Covariance4," The covariance is a single statistical figure that represents how one data set relates to another. In the example mentioned in the introduction, height and weight are being measured. You would expect that as individuals grow taller, their weight would also increase, leading to a positive covariance figure. As another example, suppose data is collected representing the number of hours someone practices golf and the score he or she may earn. In this case, you would expect a negative covariance, which means that as the number of practice hours increases, the golf score will decrease. (In golf, a lower score is better.)Consider the sample data set that was calculated above. The resulting covariance is -8.07. The negative sign here means that as the x-values increase, the y-values will tend to decrease. In fact, you can see that this is true by looking at a few of the values. For example, the x-values of 1 and 2 correspond to y-values of 7, 8 and 9. The x-values of 8 and 12 are paired respectively with y-values of 3 and 2. 


, If the number of the covariance score is large, either a large positive number or a large negative number, then you can interpret this as meaning that the two data elements are very strongly connected, either in a positive or negative way.For the sample data set, the covariance of -8.07 is fairly large. Notice that the data values range from 1 through 12, so 8 is a pretty high number. This indicates a strong connection between the x and y data sets.


, If you wind up with a covariance equal to or very near 0, you can conclude that the data points are relatively unrelated. That is, an increase in one value may or may not lead to an increase in the other. The two terms are almost randomly connected.For example, suppose you are comparing shoes sizes against SAT scores. Because there are so many factors that affect a student’s SAT scores, we would expect a covariance score of near 0. This would indicate almost no connection between the two values.


, To understand covariance visually, you can plot your data points on the x-y coordinate plane. When you do that, you should see fairly easily that the points, although not in an exactly straight line, tend to form a cluster that approximates a diagonal line from the upper left to the lower right. This is the description of a negative covariance. Also, notice that the covariance value is -8.07. This is a fairly large number compared to the data points. The high number suggests that the covariance is fairly strong, which you can see by the linear appearance of the data points.

To review plotting points on the coordinate plane, see Graph Points on the Coordinate Plane.

Understand the percent increase formula.,
Subtract the previous cost from the new cost.,
Divide the difference by the previous cost.,
Convert the answer to a percentage.",How to Calculate Cost Increase Percentage2," The percent increase formula calculates the percent increase in a cost as a percentage of the previous cost. Written out in full, the formula is Percent Increase=(New Cost−Previous Cost)Previous Cost×100{\displaystyle {\text{Percent Increase}}={\frac {({\text{New Cost}}-{\text{Previous Cost}})}{\text{Previous Cost}}}\times 100}. The ×100{\displaystyle \times 100} at the end converts the difference from a decimal to a percentage., Start your calculation by putting your variables into the formula. Then, simplify the part of your equation in parentheses by subtracting the previous cost from the new cost.For example, if you bought a gallon of milk a month ago for $2.50 and, today, it is $3.50, subtract $2.50 from $3.50 to get the dollar amount of the change, or $1.00 in this case.


, Your next step is to divide the result of the last step by the previous price. This essentially converts the different between the new and old costs to a proportion of the previous cost.In the example, this would be $1.00 (the result of the previous step) divided by $2.50 (the previous cost). 

The result is 0.40, which is expressed as a number rather than a dollar amount.


, Multiply the answer by 100 to get the percentage increase. The result will be the percentage that the previous cost has been increased by to arrive at the new cost.In the example, this is 0.40×100{\displaystyle 0.40\times 100}, which is 40 percent. 

So, the cost of a gallon of milk has increased by 40 percent between the previous and new costs.

Calculate an increase in your expenses.,
Track business expense increases.,
Determine appreciation on collectibles.,
Use the same process for other types of percent increase.",How to Calculate Cost Increase Percentage3," You can use the results of your cost increase calculations to calculate increases in cost for all of your expenses. You can then track these increases over time and see if some items are increasing faster or slower than other costs. Then, compare the increases to increases (or lack thereof) in your income to see whether your pay raises are keeping pace with your cost of living., Businesses can use cost increase percentages to determine the increases' effects on projected or actual profit margins. This information can then be used to weigh the savings from a change in suppliers or justify a selling price increase. For example, if a business sees that the price of one of its inputs to production is rising regularly, it may choose to seek an alternative input or supplier of that input. Alternately, the business might choose to raise prices accordingly., Collectibles, like vintage cars, watches, and art, might appreciate in value over time. This appreciation can be measured using the cost increase percentage calculation process. Compare previous prices of the collectible with current market prices to assess the increase. For example, if a watch sold for $100 in 1965, but is now resold on the used market for $2,000, this represents a 1900 percent price increase., The same formula and process used to find percent cost increase can be used to perform a number of other calculations. You can use the same formula with different terms to calculate the percent error (between an expected value and actual value), to find the percent difference between two amounts of time, or any number of other comparisons between two numbers."

If you have more than 6 categories, certain sections of a pie chart may be too small to effectively read and interpret.Nominal data is data that has no specific order or scale, but is categorized only by a name or category type.Examples of nominal data include favorite dessert or college major.

Ordinal data is data that is based on position or scale.Examples of ordinal data include level of satisfaction or education level.
;
, This is the total number of data points that you have. If you conducted a one-question survey, the total number of data points would be the total number of responses you received.

For example, if you surveyed 100 American millennials on who their favorite Beatle is, you will have 100 data points.


, To find a ratio, place the number of responses a particular category received over the number of data points. Turn this into a percentage by dividing the numerator by the denominator.For example, you might have found the following data from your survey:Who is your favorite Beatle?George=27100=.27{\displaystyle {\text{George}}={\frac {27}{100}}=.27}John=31100=.31{\displaystyle {\text{John}}={\frac {31}{100}}=.31}Ringo=20100=.20{\displaystyle {\text{Ringo}}={\frac {20}{100}}=.20}Paul=22100=.22{\displaystyle {\text{Paul}}={\frac {22}{100}}=.22} 


, Attach a sharpened pencil and hold the point firmly while you swing the compass to create a circle. It doesn’t matter how large the circle is, but the larger the circle, the easier it will be to create and read your pie chart.
, Use the decimal form of the percentage in your calculation. This will give you the size of each category’s section in degrees. Each section needs to be represented as a proportion of 360, since there are 360 degrees in a circle.You might need to round decimals up or down. Make sure your total number of degrees adds up to 360.

For example:George=.27×360=97.2=about97degrees{\displaystyle {\text{George}}=.27\times 360=97.2={\text{about}}\;97\;{\text{degrees}}}John=.31×360=111.6=about112degrees{\displaystyle {\text{John}}=.31\times 360=111.6={\text{about}}\;112\;{\text{degrees}}}Ringo=.20×360=72degrees{\displaystyle {\text{Ringo}}=.20\times 360=72\;{\text{degrees}}}Paul=.22×360=79.2=about79degrees{\displaystyle {\text{Paul}}=.22\times 360=79.2={\text{about}}\;79\;{\text{degrees}}} 


, Place the protractor’s origin hole in the center of the circle. Create the first angle by drawing two points, one at the 0 degree line, and one at the line showing the number of degrees of your angle. Remove the protractor, and use its straight edge to draw the borders of the section. Each line segment should begin at the circle’s center point, end at the edge of the circle, and pass through either point you drew with the protractor.

For example, the John category should be a section that is 97 degrees. So you would draw a point outside the protractor at the 0 degree line, and another point at the 97 degree line. Then you would finish drawing the section by drawing lines through these points.

Take care when  using a protractor to read it correctly. Most protractors have two sets of of numbers. Think about the size of the angle you are making to ensure you are looking at the correct numbers.


, For each new category, place the protractor’s 0 degree line over the edge of the previous section. Draw the sections using their degree measurements, just as you did the first section.
, By making each section of the pie chart a different color, it makes it easier for readers to interpret its information. The colors you use don’t matter, but if they are too dark or vibrant, reading your chart may be difficult.
, Your chart should be properly labeled so that anyone looking at it can interpret what its sections mean. Usually the category if each section is written directly on the chart. If a particular section is too small to write clearly inside of it, draw a line connecting the section to an area outside of the chart, and write the category title there.

Another option is to make a key. Instead of labeling directly on your pie chart, you can make a small box below it, denoting which color indicates which category. 


, Even though the pie chart’s section indicate their relative size, it is helpful to give readers the exact size by labeling each category’s percentage. Write the percentage above or below the category title so that it is clear which percentage applies to which section of the pie chart.
, Every chart should have a title that tells the reader what information it is displaying. Your title should be descriptive, but not too long.

For example, you might name your chart “Favorite Beatle Among American Millennials.”

,, Subtract the original number from the increased number.


For example, write on your piece of paper ""the new amount"" - ""the original amount."" If you had 12 job prospects in 2007 and you have 64 job prospects now, then the actual increase would be 52 job prospects.

, You may want to use your calculator to get an accurate number.


In our example, you would take 52 and divide it by 12. The answer in decimals would be 4.33.

,


You will want to keep between 2 and 7 decimal points in your decimal answer. The larger your change is, the more likely you will need extra decimal points for an accurate figure.

, This is how you convert a decimal to a percentage. This percentage is your percent increase.


For example, with our figure, you would multiply 4.33 times 100 to get a percent increase of 433 percent.

, Also called expansion by minors, this process involves taking a row or column of numbers, multiplying them by the determinant of the ""minor"" matrix (the matrix formed by omitting the row and column of the number that you are multiplying the minor with), and summing the results. The exact way on why this process works stems from the formal definition of the determinant, which is extremely awkward to phrase. 

While the above discussion sounds complicated, the process is really not. Let's see how cofactor expansion works. 


, Look out for 0's and 1's, as they will make calculating the determinant slightly easier.


A=(abcdefghi){\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{pmatrix}}}


, While not an actual matrix, this sign matrix tells us what sign to assign to the product.


(+−+−+−+−+){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}+&-&+\\-&+&-\\+&-&+\end{pmatrix}}}

Sign matrices do not just apply to 3x3 matrices - they apply to any number of dimensions, and the same checkerboard pattern holds.


, While any would suffice, this row or column ideally should have some 0's for ease of calculation. The reason is that during the cofactor expansion, 0 multiplied by the determinant of any minor matrix is 0, and thus does not contribute to the determinant of the matrix. This will make calculations much easier. If there are no 0's, the next easiest number to avoid arithmetic mistakes would be 1. 

Let's choose the second row (def).{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}d&e&f\end{pmatrix}}.} The corresponding sign matrix will be (−+−).{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}-&+&-\end{pmatrix}}.}


, The minor matrix is the smaller matrix created by omitting the row and column of the number. The result is a matrix with its dimension reduced by 1, hence the term ""minor.""

In our example, we chose the second row. Notice that the sign matrix says that d{\displaystyle d} must have a negative sign when doing the multiplication.


−d|bchi|{\displaystyle -d{\begin{vmatrix}b&c\\h&i\end{vmatrix}}}

Here, |bchi|{\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}b&c\\h&i\end{vmatrix}}} is the minor matrix of d.{\displaystyle d.} Compare this matrix to the original matrix - we have omitted all of the elements in the row and column of d.{\displaystyle d.} 


, 

The corresponding sign for entry e{\displaystyle e} is positive. 


e|acgi|{\displaystyle e{\begin{vmatrix}a&c\\g&i\end{vmatrix}}}


, 

The corresponding sign for entry f{\displaystyle f} is negative.


−f|abgh|{\displaystyle -f{\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\g&h\end{vmatrix}}}


, With practice, you will proceed immediately to this step and evaluate. 


detA=−d|bchi|+e|acgi|−f|abgh|{\displaystyle \det A=-d{\begin{vmatrix}b&c\\h&i\end{vmatrix}}+e{\begin{vmatrix}a&c\\g&i\end{vmatrix}}-f{\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\g&h\end{vmatrix}}}


,


B=(345910298){\displaystyle B={\begin{pmatrix}3&4&5\\9&1&0\\2&9&8\end{pmatrix}}}


,

The second row has a 0 and a 1. Use this row.


, Pay attention to signs.

Notice that the third entry in our chosen row is a 0. There is no need to calculate the determinant of its minor. 


detB=−9|4598|+1|3528|{\displaystyle \det B=-9{\begin{vmatrix}4&5\\9&8\end{vmatrix}}+1{\begin{vmatrix}3&5\\2&8\end{vmatrix}}}


,


|4598|=(4)(8)−(9)(5)=−13|3528|=(3)(8)−(2)(5)=14{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\begin{vmatrix}4&5\\9&8\end{vmatrix}}&=(4)(8)-(9)(5)=-13\\{\begin{vmatrix}3&5\\2&8\end{vmatrix}}&=(3)(8)-(2)(5)=14\end{aligned}}}


,


detB=−9(−13)+1(14)=131.{\displaystyle \det B=-9(-13)+1(14)=131.}


, We want to verify that this process works by obtaining the same value for the determinant.
, Pay attention to signs.

The second entry in our column is a 0, so don't calculate the determinant of its minor!


detB=5|9129|+8|3491|{\displaystyle \det B=5{\begin{vmatrix}9&1\\2&9\end{vmatrix}}+8{\begin{vmatrix}3&4\\9&1\end{vmatrix}}}


,


|9129|=(9)(9)−(2)(1)=79|3491|=(3)(1)−(9)(4)=−33{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\begin{vmatrix}9&1\\2&9\end{vmatrix}}&=(9)(9)-(2)(1)=79\\{\begin{vmatrix}3&4\\9&1\end{vmatrix}}&=(3)(1)-(9)(4)=-33\end{aligned}}}


,


detB=5(79)+8(−33)=131.{\displaystyle \det B=5(79)+8(-33)=131.}

The determinant obtained in Example 2 is the same as in Example 1. Notice the slightly more difficult arithmetic in Example 2, however. This reflects our choice of row/column, with such numbers as 5 and 8 multiplying by inconveniently large determinants.


, Look for rows or columns that are nearly the same as each other, or not quite a linear combination of the others.
, Column reduction applies here because the determinant does not prefer either. 

Beware that row/column reduction may change the determinant of a matrix. For example, replacing a column with a multiple of itself causes the determinant to change by that multiple, so multiplying by the reciprocal is needed to compensate. Swapping any two rows or columns will negate the determinant.


, The same process used to find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix also generalizes to higher dimensions. However, this process is long-winded and inefficient for hand calculations - even a 4x4 matrix requires 3x3 minors, which requires 2x2 minors as well. However, textbook problems that ask you to find the determinant of higher dimension matrices may have the properties outlined in step 1 of the section. Therefore, if you are clever with your reduction process, you may obtain a matrix that is easy to calculate the determinant of. 
,


B=(27−586622414−1014341−1){\displaystyle B={\begin{pmatrix}2&7&-5&8\\6&6&2&2\\4&14&-10&14\\3&4&1&-1\end{pmatrix}}} 

If we are naive about calculating the determinant of this matrix, we would simply choose any row or column (most likely the first row) and expand by minors twice. However, notice that the third row is almost a multiple of the first row, and the fourth row is almost a multiple of the second row. 


, Perform the row operations R3→R3−2R1{\displaystyle R_{3}\to R_{3}-2R_{1}} and R4→2R4−R2.{\displaystyle R_{4}\to 2R_{4}-R_{2}.}


detB=12|27−586622000−2020−4|{\displaystyle \det B={\frac {1}{2}}{\begin{vmatrix}2&7&-5&8\\6&6&2&2\\0&0&0&-2\\0&2&0&-4\end{vmatrix}}} 

While row-reducing, we replaced row 4 with twice itself, minus a linear combination of the other rows (here, just row 2). The determinant of the matrix then doubles, and thus, we must multiply by a half to compensate. 


, The entries in rows 2-4 can all be divided by 2. By factoring out a 2 from each row, the determinant of the matrix is halved, so write a factor of 2 on the outside to compensate. Since we divided three rows by 2, there will be a factor of 8.


detB=12(8)|27−583311000−1010−2|{\displaystyle \det B={\frac {1}{2}}(8){\begin{vmatrix}2&7&-5&8\\3&3&1&1\\0&0&0&-1\\0&1&0&-2\end{vmatrix}}} 


, Our row-reduction has allowed us to ""climb down the steps"" to a more manageable matrix. Pay attention to the sign. 


detB=(4)(−(−1))|27−5331010|{\displaystyle \det B=(4)(-(-1)){\begin{vmatrix}2&7&-5\\3&3&1\\0&1&0\end{vmatrix}}} 


, 


detB=4(−1)|2−531|{\displaystyle \det B=4(-1){\begin{vmatrix}2&-5\\3&1\end{vmatrix}}}


,


|2−531|=17,{\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}2&-5\\3&1\end{vmatrix}}=17,} so


detB=4(−17)=−68.{\displaystyle \det B=4(-17)=-68.}

Note that the software doesn't have to lay the information out in a straight line to come up with the answer.

, These numbers indicate that if this was a room full of children (24 of them), that the average age (the mean) is 5.5 years old. The mode of six would indicate that there are more six year old children than any other age in the room. The median is indicated by taking the set of (1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9) and counting 12 in from each side.

In the 2000 census, Thurston County, Washington had a median income of $46,975, compared to a national median income of $41,994. By dividing 46,975 by 41,994, you can figure out that Thurston County's median income is 11% higher than the national median income.
Also in the 2000 census, McDowell County, West Virginia's median income was $16,931 and the national median income was $41,994. Divide 16,931 by 41,994 to see that McDowell County is 40% below the national median.

, Since A−AX{\displaystyle A-AX} is invertible, so is A(I−X).{\displaystyle A(I-X).} Then both A{\displaystyle A} and I−X{\displaystyle I-X} are invertible. Furthermore, X−1B{\displaystyle X^{-1}B} is invertible because when we take the inverse of both sides, A−AX=(X−1B)−1{\displaystyle A-AX=(X^{-1}B)^{-1}} is well-defined, as A−AX{\displaystyle A-AX} is invertible. Then the inverse of X−1B{\displaystyle X^{-1}B} is invertible, and so is X−1B.{\displaystyle X^{-1}B.} Finally, we can deduce that B{\displaystyle B} is invertible.
, All that is left is to perform the standard algebraic manipulations, taking care to recognize that matrix multiplication is not commutative.

Begin the process of randomizing the group.,
Document your groups as they are created.",How to Randomize1," Simple randomization uses a single sequence for random assignments, so an ordinary object is acceptable for use.The only need is to be sure that it has two sides or that it can somehow be distinguished for two separate groups.


Coin
Deck of cards
Dice
Spinner;
, If you are creating groups for a study, for example, you might have a control group and a treatment group. Other uses might be in the classroom, where you are splitting a class into two groups for a game or activity.


Coin—heads to one group, tails to another
Deck of cards—evens to the first group, odds to the second group (note: remove all non-numbered cards, including face cards, aces, and jokers in order to have an even 50/50 split)
Dice—3 and lower to one group, above 3 to the other group
Spinner—left half to the first group, right half to the second group

, This means that you will start using your tool of choice to randomize the whole group into two smaller groups.


Toss the coin for each person or thing in the group.
Pull a card from a shuffled deck of cards for each person or thing. Remember to pull out non-numbered cards, including face cards, aces, and jokers.
Roll the die for each person or thing, assigning him/her/it to whichever group applies based on the number rolled.
Flick the arrow on the spinner and designate each person or thing to a group based on where it lands.

, In many cases, you will need to know who is in each group. It is important to somehow document the groups as you randomize them, and whatever method you choose, you will want to make sure that it can be saved.


Use a tool like a table in a word processing document or a spreadsheet to create the lists.
Write down the names by hand on paper, with two columns representing the groups.
Type the names into each list using a notepad app on your smartphone.

Capitalize the first letter of a direct quote from a source.,
Put a comma before a full quote.,
Lowercase quoted material that appears mid-sentence.,
Include punctuation in the quote inside the quotation marks.,
Put quotation marks around common sayings.,
Use quotation marks to emphasize a word or phrase.",How to Use Quotation Marks2," If you are quoting directly from a source, such as a book, article, or journal, always use one pair of quotations around the quote and capitalize the first letter of the direct quote. Do this if you are quoting a complete sentence. For example, you may write:Pollen states in his book, “You can eat whatever you want as long as you make it yourself.”
In Othello by William Shakespeare, Iago says in Act II, scene iii, “Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit and lost without deserving.”

, Whenever you use quotation marks around a full quote, place a comma or a colon before the first, or open, quotation mark. The comma or colon does not go in the quotation mark, just before it. This will let the reader know a quote is coming. For example:

Shakespeare notes in his diary, “I am the poor man’s playwright.”
Pollen recommends, “Eat food. Mostly plants.”

, If you are quoting a source within a sentence, not at the end of a sentence, lowercase the first letter of the quote. You can do this if you are using a partial quote of a longer quote in a sentence. For example, you may write:Pollen advocates for taking responsibility for one’s food choices, for eating “whatever you want as long as you make it yourself,” a tall order for some.

, Commas, periods, exclamation marks, dashes, and question marks that appear in the quote should all go inside the quotation marks. For example:Othello notes, “For she has eyes and she chose me.”
Pollen asks the question, “Why don’t we get to know our food?”
The last line of the poem “Sestina: Altaforte” by Ezra Pound states, “Hell blot black for always the thought ‘Peace’!”

, Familiar sayings should be demarcated with quotation marks. Cliches can also go in quotation marks. For example:Everyone knows the saying, “What goes in must come out.”
One is reminded of the familiar phrase, “It takes one to know one.”

, These are also known as scare quotes. Scare quotes are not used often. But they can be used to emphasize a word or phrase in a sentence in a mocking or annoyed tone. For example:She did not want to bring up his “issue” in mixed company.
The “in depth discussion” of the problem felt insufficient at best.

"
"
Put quotation marks around the dialogue only.,
Lowercase the word after the quotation mark.,
Use a comma before a speaker attribution.,
Include commas and periods in the quotation marks.,
Put single quotation marks around quotes within quotations.",How to Use Quotation Marks3," Quotation marks are essential for notating dialogue, as they signal to the reader the words are being spoken. You should use quotation marks around dialogue in a novel, short story, or poem. For example:“Where is my cat?” the woman screamed.
I demanded, “Let me see her.”

, Always lowercase the word that follows the close quotation mark, or the second quotation mark. Do this if the speaker attribution appears after the quoted phrase. For example:

“What time is it?” the man asked.
“Chop, chop,” she said.

, Place a comma before speaker attributions like “he said,” “she said,” “they said,” “we yelled,” etc. This will signal to the reader there is about to be dialogue. For example:He said, “I can’t make ballet class tonight, son.”
They yelled, “You hooligans!”
“We’re late,” she said to her sister.
“Tell me you love me, “ he said to his lover.

, Any commas or periods that are part of the sentence should be included in the quotation marks, even if the original quotation does not have a comma or a period. For example:“The best way to eat food,” Pollen argues, “is to make it yourself.” (From the original quote, “The best way to eat food is to make it yourself at home, whenever you can.”)
“The best investments today,” according to Smith, “are commodities and emerging-market stocks.” (From the original quote, “The best investments today are commodities and emerging-market stocks, not domestic stocks and bonds.”

, If you are quoting a phrase that already has quotation marks, change the quotation marks in the phrase to single quotation marks. Single quotation marks appear as ‘’. For example:

“So he said to me, ‘You’re going to be a great success,’ and I believed him.”

"
"
Use quotation marks for the titles of poems, short stories, and chapters in a book.,
Put quotation marks on the titles of articles and essays.,
Use quotation marks for television episodes and song titles.,
Apply quotation marks to the title of a play.,
Do not include punctuation in the quotation marks when quoting a title.",How to Use Quotation Marks4," Put one set of quotation marks around these titles to off set it properly. Only put quotations around the title, not the author’s name.For example, if you were citing the poem One Art by Elizabeth Bishop, it would appear as “One Art” by Elizabeth Bishop.
If you were citing the short story Ironhead by Aimee Bender, it would appear as “Ironhead” by Aimee Bender.
If you were citing the chapter The Boy Who Lived from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling, it would appear as “The Boy Who Lived” from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling.

, Always use quotation marks when citing the title of an article or essay in a journal, magazine, or online publication. Capitalize all of the words that are not articles in the title and use one set of quotation marks around the title only.For example, if you were citing the article The President Wants to Keep Us in the Dark by Marc Decosta, it would appear as “The President Wants to Keep Us in the Dark” by Marc Decosta.
If you were citing the essay The Fourth State of Matter by Jo Ann Beard, it would appear as “The Fourth State of Matter” by Jo Ann Beard.

, For example, if you were talking about an episode of Friends called The One With the Blackout, it would appear as “The One With the Blackout.” If you were discussing the song Tangled Up in Blue by Bob Dylan, it would appear as “Tangled Up in Blue” by Bob Dylan., Plays should always be cited with quotation marks. For example, if you were discussing the play The Crucible by Arthur Miller, it would appear as “The Crucible” by Arthur Miller.

Do not use italics or underline the title of plays. If you are citing a collection of plays by the same playwright, for example, The Collected Plays of Arthur Miller, you would use italics for the title, not quotation marks: The Collected Plays of Arthur Miller.

, Do not put punctuation that is part of the sentence in the quotation marks with the title. Only include punctuation that is already part of the title in the quotation marks. For example:Did you like “The Crucible”?
I read “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” by Edward Albee on the train today.

Write a sentence that contains a complicated list.,
Use the semicolon as a ""super-comma"" to separate the items of the list.",How to Use a Semicolon2," Each item in the sentence should contain commas, and each item should also be separated by commas.



Ex: ""I have a sister in Columbus, Ohio, another sister in Palm Springs, Florida, and a third sister in Oakland, California.""

, This will make it easier to distinguish between the items in the list.Ex: ""I have a sister in Columbus, Ohio; another sister in Palm Springs, Florida; and a third sister in Oakland, California.""

Write one sentence with internal punctuation.,
Write another closely related sentence with internal punctuation.,
Connect the sentences with a semicolon.,
Note that you can also use a semicolon to connect one sentence with internal punctuation and one simple sentence.",How to Use a Semicolon3," This sentence can use a colon, dash, or a comma. Sentences with internal punctuation tend to be longer. Using semicolons to separate sentences with internal commas is the most common method.



Ex: ""My cousin, Martha Mary Louise, is the most talented and original cook I have ever met.""

,



Ex: ""She is very resourceful and can make almost any old food taste delicious, but she does specialize in the following items: cod, fruitcake, and squash.""

,



Ex: ""My cousin, Martha Mary Louise, is the most talented and original cook I have ever met; she is very resourceful and can make almost any old food taste delicious, but she does specialize in the following items: cod, fruitcake, and squash.""

Write a sentence.,
Write another closely related sentence using a transitional phrase or a conjunctive adverb.,
Connect the two with a semicolon.",How to Use a Semicolon4," You can keep it simple.



Ex: ""I ate an entire apple pie last night.""

,



Conjunctive adverbs are words that show a relationship between the two sentences, such as cause and effect, contrast, or comparison. Some examples include: however, besides, finally, and hence.


Transitional phrases are used to move from one sentence to the next in a logical and smooth way. Some examples include in other words, moreover, and in addition.


Ex: ""As a result,' I felt sick when I woke up."",



Ex: ""I ate an entire apple pie last night; as a result, I felt sick when I woke up.""

Do not use a semicolon instead of a comma.,
Do not use a comma instead of a semi-colon.",How to Use a Semicolon5," Commas can be used to connect two simple sentences and a coordinating conjunction (but, and, nor, or so, for example), while a semicolon cannot.Example of correct usage: ""I love my cat, but he drives me crazy.""
Example of incorrect usage: ""I love my cat; but he drives me crazy.""

, A comma can never be used to separate two independent clauses (complete sentences). This is called a comma splice and should be avoided at all times.


Example of correct usage: ""My kitty is cute; he loves to cuddle.""
Example of incorrect usage: ""My kitty is cute, he loves to cuddle.""

Gather the number of envelopes you need for the number of participants.,
Stuff the envelopes with the paperwork for each participant and seal them.,
Shuffle the envelopes so that the original order of participant names is mixed up.,
Store the envelopes in a drawer or container.,
Document to which group each participant is assigned when he/she opens the envelope.",How to Randomize2," This is fairly straightforward, as each participant will be randomized, and his/her allocation will be noted on paperwork inside the envelope.


Envelopes should be opaque, meaning that they cannot be seen through. This is important to help reduce bias. However, opaque envelopes can sometimes be seen through if they are held up to bright light.Have a method for sealing the envelopes. Licking envelopes with your tongue is fine with a very small number, but when you have a larger number of envelopes, another method is preferred. Look for envelope moisteners, small sponges, a wash cloth, a glue stick, or double-sided tape.

, Whatever information you need to give them about the trial, activity, game, et cetera should be included inside. Names should not be included on paperwork inside the envelopes, because the names could be seen through the envelope if it is held up to a bright light.


Plan to keep track of the participants by documenting their group, based on the information in the envelopes they randomly receive, once they have opened their envelopes.
You will need to give further information about what the participant needs to do, to whom they need to report, and other such important information.
The information in each envelope will vary slightly depending on which group is assigned (i.e. control or treatment).
Remember to use whatever method you chose for sealing a large quantity of envelopes.

, Depending on how you plan to store the envelopes, this can be done a couple of different ways.


Shuffle the envelopes like you would a deck of cards. You could also “cut the deck” multiple times.
Lay all of the envelopes out on a table or on the floor and pick them up randomly.
Ask someone else to shuffle the envelopes, someone who never saw the stuffing process or the participant list.

, As you get participants for your trial or activity, pull the next envelope in the front or at the top for each participant. This helps to keep the assignment of participants random, because you do not know what information will be in each envelope.

, As you go over the information in the envelope with the participant, you will know to which group he/she has been assigned.


Document the names in a table or spreadsheet in a word processing program or Excel.
Write the names down in lists or columns on a piece of paper.

Know what your groups are for the lottery.,
Assign participants a number for the lottery.,
Create a container for the lottery system.,
Choose a system for drawing the numbers.,
Run the lottery on the assigned day.",How to Randomize3," A lottery system can be used for a variety of reasons; it has gained attention in recent years because of its use in school enrollments, for example. Whatever your reason is for using the lottery, be sure you know the groups to which participants will be assigned.


Treatment and control groups
Teams for a game
Programs for a learning experience
Groups for a project

, As each participant enrolls in your program or study, you will assign him/her a number. These numbers help to keep track of the participants and will be how you identify participants when you pull numbers from the lottery later.


Keep track of the numbers with something like numbered blocks, numbered balls, or simply pieces of paper with the numbers written on them in pen or marker.
Document each participant and his/her assigned number. You can do this by hand on a piece of paper with a list or table on it, or you can do it on the computer in a spreadsheet or word processing program. It would also be helpful to include a column to document to which group each participant has been assigned when the lottery is run later.

, This container will need to hold all of the numbers, however you decide to record those (e.g. numbered blocks, numbered balls, et cetera).


A machine blower, which is what is used in bingo games, could be an option. It is a cage that can hold numbered balls; when you turn it on, it blows the balls around to mix them up.
You could use a box or plastic container. As participants sign up and you assign them numbers, drop their numbered item into the box or container until the lottery. You will just have to mix them up before the lottery.
A bowl is another option. This could work for pieces of paper with the numbers written on them, as the bowl will keep them more confined and less likely to be lost.

, You are drawing the numbers in order to assign participants to some kind of group, so you need a system for doing that.


You can draw numbers by the group. For example, you will declare that you the first 10 numbers you draw will all be assigned to the control group, and the next 10 after that will be assigned to the treatment group.
You can assign by the drawing. In other words, if you have three groups, you might assign each number drawn to one of the three groups as you go and then start over again with the first group. For example, you draw #11, which you assign to Group 1; then you draw #2, which you assign to Group 2; next, you draw #17, which you assign to Group 3. Then, you start back over with Group 1 for the next number.
You could also assign by odds and evens. If you draw an even number, then it is assigned to one group, and if you draw an odd number, then it is assigned to the other group.

, After your period of participant sign-up has ended, be sure to run the lottery on the day that you announced. This will help keep the timeline on track.


If your lottery requires the audience to be in attendance, then set up in a space large enough for the participants to sit and view it, such as an auditorium or gymnasium.
Avoid bias in drawing the numbers by not looking into the container, whatever it may be, as you draw the numbers. You can close your eyes or look away as you reach into it to pull each number.
Document the group assignments as you draw each number. You can use the same document that includes each participant's name and assigned number from the beginning of the process.

Click the button to generate your random number.",How to Randomize4," Most online random generators use a numbering system, so it will be helpful if your participants are each assigned a number. Simply write a number, starting with 1, next to each name on your list.


This tool is especially useful in classrooms, where teachers can assign their students numbers and then use this tool to call on them to answer questions or read aloud.
It is also helpful in choosing winners for giveaways, as it removes any human bias or error in choosing a winner (in the case that the winner is to be chosen randomly).

, There are a variety of websites available for this.


Random.org
Random Number Generator/Picker
Random Choice Generator
Research Randomizer
Random Number Generator by Intemodino Group

, Most of these websites simply ask for your first and last numbers, and it will generate a number from within that range. Others might ask for more information, like the Research Randomizer, which is helpful in research studies.

, When you click it, the program will run an algorithm, which will randomly select a number for you within the range you entered.


Document the number(s) generated as you need to. If you are using this tool to randomly assign numbers to participants, then have a document ready on which to add each number generated.

Let’s imagine that you have planted a dozen sunflowers and are keeping track of how tall they are each week.
All of your flowers started out 24 inches tall. Most of your flowers grew about 8-12 inches, so they’re now about 32-36 inches tall.
But a neighboring child accidentally threw his ball into your yard, and when he ran in to get it, he crushed one of your sunflowers!
When you measure your flowers at the end of the week, the crushed one is only about 3 inches off the ground. Since the others are so much taller, you might consider this crushed flower an outlier.;
, This will help you find the median or mid-point later.


In order, your sunflower heights in inches are 3, 32, 32, 33, 33, 33, 34, 34, 35, 35, 36, 36.

, For the sunflower example, the halfway point is between 33 and 34.

, To find Q1, determine the median number in the first half your data. The median is the number that falls in the middle of the data.


In our sunflower example, the first half of the data is 3, 32, 32, 33, 33, 33.
The middle is between 32 and 33, so the median is 32.5.
Call this Q1.
Q1=32.5

, To find Q3, determine the median number in the second half of your data.


In our sunflower example, the second half of the data is 34, 34, 35, 35, 36, 36.
The middle is between 35 and 35, so the median is 35.
Call this Q3.
Q3=35

, This number is the interquartile range (IQR).


Q3-Q1=IQR
35-32.5=2.5
IQR=2.5

, Outliers are any number that is larger than Q3+1.5(IQR) or smaller than Q1-1.5(IQR). Start with your upper limit.


Q3+1.5(IQR)
35+1.5(2.5)
35+3.75=38.75
38.75 is your upper limit. Any number higher than 38.75 is an outlier.
In the sunflower data set, no number is higher than the upper limit.

, The process is similar to finding outliers beyond the upper limit, but the formula is a little different.


Q1-1.5(IQR)
32.5-1.5(2.5)
32.5-3.75=28.75
28.75 is your lower limit. Any number lower than 28.75 is an outlier.
In the sunflower data set, 3 is less than 28.75, so it is an outlier. You can justify your decision to eliminate it from your data., This will help you determine whether the outliers are causing problems with your data.


Perhaps the heights of your 10 sunflowers, in inches are: 34, 32, 33, 33, 34, 3, 35, 35, 36, 36, 33, and 32.
If you include 3, the average height of your sunflowers is 31.3 inches.
If you disregard 3, the average height of your sunflowers is 33.9 inches.
If you wanted to make generalizations about your flowers sunflowers, (such as calculating the average amount that they grew over a week’s time) you may want to reject the outliers.

, If human error caused a very high or very low number (as it did in the sunflower example), this data point isn’t very useful to you. Ask yourself whether this number is really a part of the data set that you intended to study.


Since someone stepped on your sunflower, the outlying data point doesn’t actually tell you anything about how your sunflowers grew. , Base your decision on whether including the number in your data set gives you helpful information or not.


In the case of the crushed sunflower, you would probably reject the 3 inch sunflower.
You might also reject outliers if you think you measured wrong or wrote down the wrong number.
On the other hand, if your sunflower was much shorter than the others because it was planted in a place where it did not receive direct sunlight, you may decide that this is useful information and include this number in your data set.

, Eliminate this number from your data. From this point forward, do your calculations without this number.

, Rejecting outliers makes your data “impure.” You should only reject data points if you have a very good reason. If you need to write up a report of your data, be prepared to explain why you rejected the outliers using the formulas Q3+1.5(IQR) and Q1-1.5(IQR). "

Remember this: the clause that precedes the punctuation mark should be able to stand on its own as an independent clause.,
Don't use the colon in the following situations:


When a clause includes an introductory word such as for example, or namely.,
Remember this as well: Do not use a colon to introduce a list that is the complement of a verb or the object of a preposition.",How to Use a Colon in a Sentence," A colon, technically speaking, is a punctuation mark consisting of two equally sized dots in a vertical configuration (see the image above). It is used to mark a major division in a sentence, to indicate that what follows is an elaboration, summation, implication, etc., of what precedes it. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on. Want to know more? Read further:

Indicate plural nouns.,
Specify an acronym.,
Mention significant dates.,
Use parenthetical citations.In academic writing for both the MLA and APA styles, parenthetical citations need to be included in the text whenever you directly or indirectly cite another work.,
Place punctuation outside of the parentheses.Ordinarily, parenthetical information falls within a broader sentence.,
Punctuate inside the parentheses for full sentences.,
Enclose other punctuation as needed.Commas, colons, or semicolons that appear in the middle of parenthetical text should be included in the parentheses.,
Only use punctuation when called for in the sentence.",How to Use Parentheses," By setting it off in parentheses, you de-emphasize its significance so that it does not detract from the main point of your text.


Example: J. R. R. Tolkien (author of The Lord of the Rings) and C. S. Lewis (author of The Chronicles of Narnia) were both regular members of a literary discussion group known as the ""Inklings."";
, Oftentimes, when you spell out a numerical figure, you may find it useful to note the numerical form of that figure, as well. You can specify that numerical form by placing it in parentheses.


Example: She owes seven hundred dollars ($700) in rent by the end of this week.

, You should place the numbers or letters used to highlight each point in parentheses.


Example: The company is looking to hire someone who (1) has a great work ethic, (2) knows everything there is to know about the latest photo editing and enhancement software, and (3) has at least five years of professional experience in the field.
Example: The company is looking to hire someone who (A) has a great work ethic, (B) knows everything there is to know about the latest photo editing and enhancement software, and (C) has at least five years of professional experience in the field.

, Within your text, you may end up speaking about a singular form of a specific noun while realizing that the same information would also apply to a plural form of that noun. If the reader would benefit from knowing that you are speaking to the plural form as well as the singular form, you can note this intention by placing an “s” in parentheses following the noun that could be pluralized.


Example: The organizers of this year's festival are hoping to have a big crowd, so bring along your friend(s) when you come.

, When writing about an organization, product, or other object that is usually referred to by an acronym, you need to write out the full name of the object the first time you refer to it in your text. If you intend to refer to it by its standard acronym after that point, you should make a note of that acronym in parentheses so that readers will know to look for it later on.


Example: Employees and volunteers with the Animal Protective League (APL) hope to reduce and eventually eliminate cases of animal cruelty and mistreatment within the community.

, While it is not always necessary, in certain contexts, you may need to indicate the birth date and/or the death date of a certain individual who you are mentioning in the body of the text. When this happen, you need to enclose these dates in parentheses.


Example: Jane Austen (1775-1817) is best known for works like Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.
George R. R. Martin (b. 1948) is the man responsible for the popular Game of Thrones series.

, These citations contain bibliographic information and should be included in parentheses immediately after the borrowed information.


APA Example: Research suggests that a link exists between migraine headaches and clinical depression (Smith, 2012).
MLA Example: Research suggests that a link exists between migraine headaches and clinical depression (Smith 32).
For more information regarding the proper use of in-text parenthetical citations, please see How to Write In-Text Citations.

, If the parentheses appear at the end of the sentence or immediately before another form of punctuation, that punctuation mark must be placed on the outside of the closing parentheses and not on the inside.


Good example: J. R. R. Tolkien (author of The Lord of the Rings) was good friends with C. S. Lewis (author of The Chronicles of Narnia).
Bad example: J. R. R. Tolkien (author of The Lord of the Rings) was good friends with C. S. Lewis (author of The Chronicles of Narnia.)

, Occasionally, an aside or similar information enclosed in parentheses will be phrased as a complete sentence, rather than merely being part of a broader sentence. When this happens, you should punctuate the sentence inside the parentheses by placing the period on the inside of the closing parentheses.


Good example: A new church was built on the grounds of the old one. (This took place 14 years after the old church had been torn down.)
Bad example: A new church was built on the grounds of the old one. (This took place 14 years after the old church had been torn down).

, Similarly, if you need to include a question mark or exclamation point at the end of the statement in your parentheses, rather than at the end of the broader sentence that parenthetical text falls inside, you can include those two punctuation marks on the inside of the closing parentheses.


Good example: J. R. R. Tolkien (author of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and more) was a member of a literary group known as the “Inklings.”
Good example: My sister's husband (remember him?) is planning a surprise for her birthday.
Bad example: My sister's husband (remember him)? is planning a surprise for her birthday.

, Parentheses can appear by themselves within a broader sentence. You do not need to introduce them with any other punctuation mark, nor do you need to finish them with another punctuation mark. The only time you should place a punctuation mark before or after your parentheses would be if the sentence would have included that punctuation mark there without the parenthetical information included.


Good example: Contrary to her previous rationale (or lack thereof), she decided to change her stance on the issue.
Bad example: Contrary to her previous rationale (or lack thereof) she decided to change her stance on the issue.

Write a complete thought using both a subject and a verb.,
Write a second complete thought that closely relates to the first.,
Connect the two independent clauses.,
Insert a comma before the coordinating conjunction.,
Write a compound sentence.,
Construct a dependent clause.,
Connect a compound sentence and dependent clause with a comma.,
Use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.,
Avoid a comma splice.,
Use a comma when the dependent clause comes first.",How to Use a Comma in a Compound Sentence," This is called an independent clause, as it is a group of words that has both a subject and verb and forms a complete thought.For example, “Mom makes me breakfast before school.” In this example, “mom” is the subject and “makes” is the verb. It also forms a complete thought or sentence.

, Your second independent clause should also contain both a subject and a verb, but it should relate to your first independent clause.For example, “I don’t have enough time to eat it.” This independent clause closely relates to the first clause you wrote and contains both a subject, “I” and a verb, “have.”

, To form a compound sentence, you will need to connect your two independent clauses together with a coordinating conjunction. There are seven commonly used coordinating conjunctions or words.Coordinating conjunctions include: and, but, yet, nor, or, for, so.
One of the easiest ways to remember the coordinating conjunctions is to form an acronym. The most commonly used acronym is: FANBOYS (F-for, A-and, N-nor, B-but, O-or, Y-yet, S-so).For example, “Mom makes me breakfast before school, but I don’t have enough time to eat it.”

, A comma is used to add clarity. Therefore, it’s important to use a comma when connecting two independent clauses, as you want to ensure your readers know the two are related.For example, “Mom makes me breakfast before school, but I don’t have enough time to eat it.”
Make the beginning of the second independent clause lowercase. Now that you have both a coordinating conjunction and a comma in place, you need to make the first letter of your second independent clause lowercase.
In the above example, you would need to keep the “I” capitalized as it is a proper pronoun. However, another example would be, “Mom makes me breakfast before school, but my dog always steals the food before I can eat it.”
In this case, the “m” in “my” was capitalized when it was an independent clause - “My dog always steals the food before I can eat it.” Now that it’s part of a compound sentence, connected by a comma and a coordinating conjunction, the “m” is lowercase.

, Join two independent clauses, or complete thoughts, together using both a coordinating conjunction and a comma.


For example, “Mom makes me breakfast before school, but I don’t have enough time to eat it.”

, Unlike an independent clause, a dependent clause does not form a complete thought because it begins with a subordinating word (when, if, because). However, make sure the dependent clause still relates to your compound sentence, as your goal is to connect the two, by forming a complex compound sentence.For example, “Because I am always hungry in the morning.”

, When the dependent clause comes before the compound sentence, you can use a comma to connect the two, to form a complex compound sentence.


For example, “Because I am always hungry in the morning, mom makes me breakfast before school, but I don’t have enough time to eat it.”
Notice the “m” in “mom” becomes lowercase, once you’ve connected the dependent clause with a comma.

, When forming a compound sentence, make sure the comma is always placed before the coordinating conjunction and not after it.


For example, “Mom makes me breakfast before school, but I…”

, A comma splice occurs when you use a comma with two independent clauses, without using a coordinating conjunction.


For example, “Mom makes me breakfast before school, I don’t have enough time to eat it.” This is incorrect, as a coordinating conjunction wasn’t used. The two independent clauses should have been formed into two complete sentences using a period. “Mom makes me breakfast.” “I don’t have enough time to eat it.” Another option is to use a semicolon: ""Mom makes me breakfast before school; I don't have enough time to eat it."" You could also use a coordinating conjunction: ""Mom makes me breakfast before school, but I don't have enough time to eat it.""

, When forming a complex compound sentence, if the dependent clause is before the compound sentence, you can use a comma. Otherwise, if the dependent clause comes after a comma isn’t needed.


For example, “Because I am always hungry in the morning, mom makes me breakfast before school, but I don’t have enough time to eat it.” You would not use a comma if the complex compound sentence was, “Mom makes me breakfast before school, but I don’t have enough time to eat it because I don’t wake up early enough.”

Punctuate dialogue that carries over into multiple paragraphs.,
Punctuate dialogue using dashes as tags instead of commas.,
Consider using verbs other than “said” to tag dialogue.",How to Punctuate Dialogue," When you’re writing dialogue, the most important thing to remember is to put the dialogue that was said in quotes, and to end the dialogue with a comma within the quote if you’re going to tag it, or attribute it to a speaker. Using a comma followed by an end quote and then a verb and the name or pronoun of the person who said it, or followed by the name and then the verb, is the most common way to punctuate dialogue. Here are some examples:“I want to spend all day reading in bed,” Mary said.
“I wish I could do that, but I have to go to work,” Tom said.
“You can get some rest over the weekend,” said Mary.;
, When you start a sentence with a dialogue tag, then the same rules apply, except you’ll be using a verb and a noun at the beginning of a sentence followed by a comma, an opening quote, the dialogue, a period or another form of closing punctuation, and another quote. Here are some examples:Mary said, “I think I’ll have cupcakes for breakfast.”
Tom said, “Do you think that’s the healthiest option?”
She said, “Absolutely not. Which is exactly what makes it appealing.”

, Another way to punctuate dialogue is to write a sentence with a dialogue tag in the middle. This is a way of creating a pause while continuing the sentence. To do this, you should tag the first part of the sentence as you normally would, except that you don’t put a period at the end and use a comma to introduce the second half of the sentence instead. The thing to keep in mind is that you shouldn’t capitalize the second half of the same sentence or thought. Here are some examples:“I’d like to go running,” Mary said, “but I’d rather just sit in this rocking chair.”
“There are few things more appealing than sitting in that rocking chair,” Tom said, “but sometimes running may be just the thing you need.”
“I need running about as much as I need…” Mary said, “a stone in my shoe.”

, Another way to punctuate dialogue is to tag one sentence as you normally would, using a period at the end, and then starting a new sentence without attributing the dialogue to anyone. It should be clear from the context that the same person is speaking. Here are some examples:


“The new girl in school seems nice,” Mary said. “I’d like to get to know her better.”
“I thought she was a little bit stuck up,” said Tom. “That’s pretty generous of you.”
“I don’t know about that,” Mary said. “I just like to give people a chance. You should try it.”

, A lot of dialogue doesn’t need to be tagged at all. It should be obvious from the context who the speaker is. You can also mention the people who are speaking next to the sentences they speak, so it becomes more clear who is talking. You don’t want your readers to go line chasing, or trying to work backwards to figure out who is speaking in a two-person conversation with unattributed dialogue. At the same time, you don’t want to get redundant with saying “she said” or “he said” every time someone speaks. Here are some examples:“I just don’t think this is working anymore.” Mary fiddled with her pen.
Tom looked down at the floor. “How can you say that?”
“I can say it because I feel it. This isn’t working, Tom. How can you not see it?”
“I guess I must have been blind.”

, To punctuate dialogue with a question mark, simply place the question mark before the end quote, replacing the usual period you would use. The tricky part is that, though it may look strange, you should tag the dialogue with a lower-cased “said” or another speaking verb, because this will still technically be part of the same sentence. Alternately, you can tag the question at the beginning of the sentence or leave out the tag altogether. Here are some examples:“Why didn’t you come to my birthday party?” Mary asked.
Tom said, “I thought we were broken up. Aren’t we?”
“Since when is that a good excuse to ditch someone’s party?”
“What better excuse can there be?” said Tom.

, To punctuate your sentences with an exclamation mark, follow the same protocol you’d use to punctuate a sentence with a period or a question mark. Most writers would tell you that exclamation marks should be used sparingly, and that the sentence and story itself should convey excitement. Still, an occasional exclamation mark never hurt anybody. Here are some examples:


“I can’t wait for summer to be over so I can go back to school!” said Mary.
“Me too!” said Tom. “I’ve been so bored at home.”
Mary said, “You’re telling me! I’ve started three ant collections in this month alone.”

, This can be a bit tricky and won’t be used very frequently, but it can be useful to know how to punctuate dialogue with quotes inside of it. Just use a single quote at the end and beginning of the quoted phrase, which could be the name of a work of art, or a quote attributed to another person. Here are some examples:


“My favorite Hemingway story is ‘Hills Like White Elephants,’” Mary said.
“Didn’t our English teacher say it was ‘the world’s most boring story’?” asked Tom.

, If you’re writing dialogue between two characters, then if you want to be believable, they won’t always politely wait their turns to speak. Sometimes they may interrupt each other in mid-sentence, just as real people often do. To show this interruption, you can use a dash at the end of the interrupted sentence, provide the sentence that is interrupting the original speaker, and consider using a dash at the beginning of the sentence if it is picked up again. Here are some examples:Tom said, “I thought about calling, but I got too busy and —”
“I’m tired of your excuses,” said Mary. “Every time you don’t call —”
“This is different,” Tom said. “I promise.”

, Not all dialogue has to be explicitly stated or placed in quotes. Sometimes, it’s not important to state exactly what each character said, but to get across the general idea that it was stated. This can offer some relief to readers who are tired of reading dialogue and it can also be a way to avoid directly stating something that is better off explained indirectly. Here are some examples:He told her he didn’t feel like going to the park.
She said she didn’t care whether or not he came with her.
He said she needed to stop being so sensitive all the time.

, Another thing you can do is break up a sentence with a dialogue tag to indicate a pause or to show that the character is thinking or struggling to find something to say. This can help add tension to a conversation and can also make it feel more realistic at times; not everyone can come up with the perfect statement on command. Here are some examples:


“Well,” Sarah said. “I guess there’s nothing left to say.”
“I knew that,” said Jerry. “But I wanted you to figure it out for yourself.”

, You don’t need to tag every single sentence of dialogue or to make it so every character only says one sentence before another character speaks. Sometimes, a character will speak at greater length, and you can show this simply by quoting one sentence after another until the character is done talking; then, you can either just place end punctuation on the end of the last sentence or attribute the dialogue to a character using a tag. Here’s how it will look:“I’ve had such a long day. Who wants to go see an improv troupe with me?” said Mary.
Jake said, “I’d rather hang out with my dog than go to work any day. He’s so helpless without me.”

, Sometimes, a character may speak for multiple paragraphs without stopping. To indicate this through correct punctuation, you should open the quote for the first paragraph, write down what the character says, and end the paragraph with either a period, a question, or an exclamation mark. Then, start the second paragraph with an open quote and keep going until the character is done speaking. When this happens, just close the quote with end punctuation as you normally would. Do it like so:(Paragraph 1:) “I’ve really wanted to tell you about my friend Bill...he’s such a crazy guy.

(Paragraph 2:) “Bill owned a cactus farm but sold it to live on a sailboat. Then he sold the boat to start building a castle, but he got tired of that and decided to swim across the Atlantic ocean instead.”


, Not every country uses quotes to indicate that characters are talking. Some countries, such as Russia, France, or Spain, rely on using the dash to indicate that someone is talking instead. In this method, you don’t need to tag the dialogue and need to trust the reader to understand who is speaking. If you use it, you have to use it consistently throughout the piece of writing. This can take a bit of practice, but it can create an interesting effect if you’re committed to it. Here is an example:


—I guess I’ll have to get going.
—That’s fine by me.
—So long, then.

, Though writers such as Hemingway or Carver rarely use any dialogue tag but “said,” you can occasionally use a different tag if it feels more appropriate. While there’s no need to weary your reader with elaborate or overly-fancy sounding verbs such as “inquired” or “questioned,” you can occasionally use other verbs for a breath of fresh air. Here are some examples:


“I have such a crush on my yoga teacher,” Lacy told her.
Mary asked, “Isn’t he a little too old for you?”
“Age is just a number,” Lacy replied.

Use semicolons to clarify lists.,
Semicolons are used for related but complete (independent) sentence clauses.,
Unlike commas, semicolons almost never use conjunctions.,
Colons can be used to start lists.,
Colons are used to offset a phrase and an explanation or an elaboration.,
Colons can be used to offset independent introductory clauses.,
Think about what kind of pause basic punctuation denotes.",How to Learn to Use a Colon or Semicolon," You can think of semicolons like super commas in this case. For example, if you were to list towns in states, you might type ""Albany, New York, Dallas, Texas, Boise, Idaho"". See all of those unnecessary commas causing confusion? It's neater to simply write ""Albany, New York; Dallas, Texas; Boise, Idaho"";
, Instead of saying, ""I walked the dog. She chased a car"", you would say ""I walked the dog; she chased a car."" If you use a comma to fix it, make sure you don't do this: ""I walked the dog, she chased a car."" Note that a semicolon is not just a replacement for a comma: it is more like a replacement for a period. Though you could say, ""While I walked the dog, she kept chasing cars,"" you would not say ""While I walked the dog; she kept chasing."" This is not acceptable because the first clause is not a complete sentence.

, When using a comma, you sometimes need a conjunction, as in ""Sarah was hungry, but she didn't want to eat."" In contrast, because each clause is capable of being a complete sentence, do not use words such as ""and"" or ""but"" after a semicolon. The only case where it is appropriate to use a conjunction is at the end of a list, such as ""Phoenix, Arizona; Sacramento, California; and Seattle, Washington.""

, If you are going to list objects, it can be helpful to separate the list with a colon, e.g. ""I like four colors: red, yellow, green, and blue.""


You can use colons and semicolons in the same list, but they have different purposes: ""He had visited three cities: New York, New York; Miami, Florida; and Los Angeles, California."" Be careful when adding both, however as it can appear complicated.
A colon is typically used for lists that are explicit: you have said he visited three cities, and now you are going to list them. You typically wouldn't use a colon in ""I like red, yellow, green, and blue,"" though it is allowed.

, This is a common usage seen on wikiHow, and has been used within this very article: ""a colon is typically used for lists that are explicit: you have said he visited three cities, and now you are going to list them.""

, This encompasses the above uses, but is harder to explain. Think of a long sentence like this one: each half is a separate sentence, but the first half sets up the second.

, A comma is the weakest pause, and a period the strongest. A semicolon is stronger that a comma, and weaker than a colon. This can help you decide in cases where the distinction is not clear.

”Apples are yummy.” In this independent clause, “apples” is the subject, “are yummy” is the verb. The sentence, as a whole, provides the reader with enough information for it to make logical sense.
”The student’s backpack was filled with heavy textbooks.” In this independent clause, “the student’s backpack” is the subject. “Was filled” is the verb. “With heavy textbooks” gives the sentence meaning and provides extra description.
”Sebastian’s coffee was too hot to drink.” In this independent clause, “Sebastian’s coffee” is the subject. “Was too hot” is the verb phrase. “To drink” is an infinitive (a verb in its most natural form, before it is changed to show tense); this infinitive adds additional information.
”The long and winding road took us to the spooky, derelict, run-down castle high above the city.” In this long independent clause, “the long and winding road” is the subject and “took” is the verb. Just because it is long and has a lot of commas does not make it a comma splice or run-on sentence!;
, A dependent clause, in contrast to its independent brother, may contain both a subject or verb but does not express a complete thought. For example:


”When the sun set over the horizon.” In this case, “the sun” is the subject and “set” is the verb, but the reader is left to wonder what the actual meaning/action is. This is an example of an adverbial clause, which is a dependent clause that begins with a subordinating conjunction.”If the singer doesn’t show up for her concert.” Again, the reader is left to wonder “what happens” At the end of the clause. “Singer” is the subject and “does not show” is the verb phrase.
”Why you did that.” This is a nominal dependent clause that starts with an interrogative (who, whom, what, which, whoever, when, where, how, and why). It contains a subject (you) and a verb (did), but still is missing information to allow it stand on its own.

, Now that you can identify an independent clause and a dependent clause, you must now be able to recognize when two independent clauses are joined together with a comma. For example:


”I went to the store, I had to buy groceries for dinner.” In this case, identify the two subjects. In both independent clauses, it is “I.” Then, identify the verbs. In the first sentence it is “went” and in the second, “had to buy.” Now you can clearly see where the comma shouldn’t be; in between the two subjects!
”When the sun set over the horizon, the penguins went to sleep, they were quite tired.” In this comma splice, it may be a bit trickier to decide where the comma splice begins because there is a dependent clause acting as an introductory phrase. “When the sun set over the horizon” is the dependent clause with the subject, sun, and the verb, set. However, it cannot stand on its own. Therefore, the comma splice appears between “the penguins went to sleep” and “they were quite tired.”
”The mountain climbers, if they can make it out alive, will be worldwide heroes!” In this case, we can identify the subject as “the climbers” and the verb “will be.” The dependent clause in the middle “if they make it out alive,” is extra information. In this case, even though there are two commas, there is no comma splice!

, To fix a comma splice, you can insert a period, exclamation point, or semicolon where the comma splices the two independent clauses. Remember to capitalize the first word in second independent clause if not using a semicolon. For example:


”The dancers were beautiful, they were very well-coordinated.” This can be fixed by “The dancers were beautiful. They were very well-coordinated.” Or “The dancers were beautiful! They were very well-coordinated.” Or “The dancers were very beautiful; they were very well-coordinated.”
”When I sip coffee, I think of my mother, she made the best coffee.” This can be fixed by “When I sip coffee, I think of my mother. She made the best coffee!” Or “When I sip coffee, I think of my mother. She made the best coffee!” Or “When I sip coffee, I think of my mother; she made the best coffee.”
”I never thought about my career, when I was your age, I only thought about dating.” You can fix this by “I never thought about my career. When I was your age, I only thought about dating.” Or “I never thought about my career. When I was your age, I only thought about dating!” Or “I never thought about my career; when I was your age, I only thought about dating.” This comma splice is a bit different, however. You can put the punctuation on either side of the dependent clause “when I was your age.” For example: “I never thought about my career, when I was your age. I only thought about dating.” Or, you can change up the sentence all together by saying: ""When I was your age, I never thought about my career. I only thought about dating.""

, An easy way to remember coordinating conjunctions is with the acronym “FANBOY.”This stands for: for, and, nor, but, or yet. To fix a semicolon, you can add a coordinating conjunction after the comma in the splice.


”My sisters and I went to the beach, we had a great time.” You can add a coordinating conjunction to fix this comma splice and to give additional information. For example: “My sisters and I went to the beach, and we had a great time.” Perhaps if you and your sisters do not get along or do not like the beach, you might say: “My sisters and I went to the beach, yet we had a great time!” Each coordinating conjunction adds subtle meaning, so be careful on which you use.
”The large dog jumped the fence, he was chasing the cat.” You can fix this by adding: “The large dog jumped the fence, for he was chasing the cat.”
”The coffee house’s music was very hypnotic, it distracted me from studying.” You can fix this by: “The coffee house’s music was very hypnotic, but it distracted me from studying.” Or “The coffee house’s music was very hypnotic, and it distracted me from studying.”

, Subordinating conjunctions are used to add complexity to two independent clauses.Subordinating conjunctions include: because, therefore, after, although, as, as if, even if, since, that etc. There are many more subordinating conjunctions! To fix a comma splice with a subordinating conjunction, remove the comma and replace it with the conjunction.


”The movie was quite boring, we both fell asleep halfway through.” You can fix this with a subordinating conjunction such as: “The movie was quite boring as we both fell asleep halfway through.”
”The food was bland, it had no seasoning.” To fix this, you might write: “The food was bland because it had no seasoning.”
”The table was wobbly, our drinks slid off of it when the waitress hit it.” To fix it with a subordinating conjunction, you might say something like: “The table was wobbly therefore our drinks slid off of it when the waitress hit it.” Or, you can add the subordinating phrase somewhere else in the sentence, such as: “Our drinks slid off the table when the waitress hit it, therefore, our table was wobbly.”

, A good tip for revising is to not worry about fixing punctuation issues until you have a draft. Worrying about punctuation while you write may frustrate you and interrupt your writing flow. While your goal is not to write a comma splice, you can always go back and fix mistakes. Focusing on each and every comma placement may cause more stress and worse writing., When you want to revise your draft for comma splices, start reading. Read one sentence at a time and read it out loud. This will help you slow down and to read what is actually on the page. It is easy for your brain to insert words that aren’t there or automatically fix mistakes.Even professional writers have this problem!


Another tip is to read your draft backwards. That is, start with the last sentence in your draft and read it (forward). Then, move to the next to the last. This will help scramble your brain a bit to help you read what is there. You are more likely to see mistakes this way.
You can use a pointer (such as the tip of your pencil) to pick out your commas. Read what you have written on either side of the comma. Ask yourself: “Are these independent clauses on either side of this comma?” If yes, then you have a comma splice.

, If you want to find every comma in your digital writing, you can use shortcut commands to pick out each comma. In most writing programs, you can press Ctrl+F to pull up the “find” command.


Just type in the comma symbol , and hit “find.” Your document should pull up every instance a comma appears and highlight it. You can more easily read what is on either side of the comma this way.
There are usually controls (or arrows) to navigate back and forth between comma uses.

, To highlight all of your commas in your writing at once, you can conditionally format your writing to highlight or change the color of every comma in your writing. This is a great way to look over your whole document at once.To do this, pull up the find command (Ctrl+F). Then, find the advanced options. In Microsoft Word, it is the down arrow on the right hand side of the box. In Google documents, it is the ellipsis ... to the right of the box. You will be looking for the “find and replace” tool.
In the find box, write the comma symbol ,

In the replace box, write the comma symbol but change the font. You can change it to a bright color, like red, so you can see it more easily. In most word processors, you can also highlight it or make it bold, italicize it, etc.
Click okay and every comma in the document should be changed! It should be very easy to review your commas this way.

Begin by setting up the first part of the sentence.,
Add the colon after the first part of the sentence.,
Finish the sentence by adding the list.,
Notice you can rearrange the sentence so it doesn’t need a colon.,
Remember you always need a complete sentence before the colon.,
Introduce a complete idea in the first part of the sentence.,
Add the colon after the complete idea.,
Finish the sentence with an idea that is a continuation of the beginning of the sentence.,
Keep in mind you don’t always need to have an independent clause after the colon.,
Introduce a speaker in the first half of the sentence.,
Add the colon after the first half of the sentence.,
Finish the sentence by adding in the quotation.,
Don’t confuse colons with semi-colons.",How to Use a Colon to Extend a Sentence," What kind of list are you going to write down? Perhaps you want to make a list of the kinds of fruit your pet parakeet, Ricky, likes.So, introduce this idea in the first half of the sentence: “My parakeet Ricky likes the following types of fruit.”;
, So your sentence will now look like this: “My parakeet Ricky likes the following types of fruit:”

, Remember to always put commas between each item, and before the “and.” The comma before the “and” is called an oxford comma and its use is debatable.But for our examples, we are going to use it.


Your completed sentence should look like this: “My parakeet Ricky likes the following types of fruit: strawberries, kiwis, and pineapple.”

, For instance, you can rearrange this sentence so it looks like this: “My parakeet Ricky likes strawberries, kiwis, and pineapple.”


In the sentence without a colon, the pieces of fruit become the direct objects of the verb, and complete the sentence.
But, you wouldn’t just say “My parakeet Ricky likes.” by itself because it doesn’t make sense alone and is not a complete sentence., In our example, “My parakeet likes the following types of fruit.” can work as a complete sentence, though not a very detailed one.


Whatever information follows the colon does not need to be a full sentence. So, make sure you always have a whole idea before using a colon.

, For example, you may begin your sentence this way: “John favors sweet snacks over salty ones.”

, It will now look like this: “John favors sweet snacks over salty ones:”

, So the example sentence will look like this:“John favors sweet snacks over salty ones: he likes pie, cake, and cookies.”


Notice how this independent clause is a completion of the first part of the sentence.

, It can simply be a phrase or a word, such as: “John made himself a snack: chocolate chip cookies.”, For example: “Mary Rogers makes the case for ice cream this way:”


Now, the reader is aware that May Rogers is the one who is going to be quoted.

, The example will now look like this: “Mary Rogers makes the case for ice cream this way:”

, For our example, we are using single quotes but in your paper or writing, you will use double quotes.


The final sentence will now look like this: “Mary Rogers makes the case for ice cream this way: ‘Ice cream is a delightful snack that is creamy and delicious.’”

, Semi-colons are meant to join two related independent clauses. Colons, on the other hand, show that what follows after the colon is an extension of the beginning of the sentence.


Also, unlike semi-colons, the second part of the sentence does not have to be an independent clause with colons.
Just remember, you always need to use a full sentence before a colon.

Use an apostrophe to indicate ownership by a proper noun.,
Be consistent when you use apostrophes after words that end in ""s."" When someone's name ends with an ""s,"" it is acceptable to use an apostrophe without an ""s"" to show ownership, but linguists with the Chicago Manual of Style, along with others, prefer to add an ""s"" after the apostrophe.Note the difference in usage:

Acceptable: Jones' house; Francis' window; Enders' family.,
Don't use an apostrophe to indicate ownership when using ""it"".,
Use apostrophes to indicate ownership by a plural noun.,
In general, don't use an apostrophe to indicate a plural.,
Know how to use apostrophes for acronyms and years.,
Use apostrophes in contractions.,
Be aware of the its/it's trap.,
Avoid using contractions that don't exist.,
When writing in cursive, always connect letters after an apostrophe to the rest of the word.",How to Use Apostrophes," An apostrophe with an ""s"" after a proper noun indicates that the person, place or thing owns whatever noun follows his or her name. For example, ""Mary's lemons."" We know the lemons belong to Mary because of the 's. Other examples include ""China's foreign policy"" and ""the orchestra's conductor.""

Ownership with certain proper nouns can be tricky. ""Sunday's football game"" is not technically correct (because Sunday is incapable of ownership) but it's perfectly acceptable to say and write. ""A hard day's work"" is likewise perfectly correct, even though the day is incapable of ownership.

,

Preferred: Jones's house; Francis's window; Enders's family.


Whichever style you prefer using, be consistent with it. It doesn't really matter which policy you adopt, as long as you adopt it consistently.

, ""China's foreign policy"" is correct, but say your reader already knows you're talking about China, and you start referring to the country as ""it."" If you were to reference something China owned in this way, you'd say ""its foreign policy.""

The reason for this is to avoid confusion between ""its"" used for possession and ""it's"" used as a contraction of ""it is."" If you're not sure whether to use an apostrophe or not, try saying the sentence with ""it is"" or ""it has."" If it doesn't make sense (the way that ""it is foreign policy"" cannot substitute for ""China's foreign policy""), then drop the apostrophe.

, One common trip-up on apostrophe usage for a plural group occurs when people want to discuss what a family owns. For instance, say the Smart family lives across the street from you and owns a boat. The boat is ""the Smarts' boat,"" not ""the Smart's boat."" Because you are talking about all of the members of the Smart family, you would start with ""Smarts."" Because all the Smarts (presumably) own the boat, you add the apostrophe after the ""s.""

If the family's last name ends in ""s,"" make it plural before adding an apostrophe. For instance, if you wanted to discuss the Williams family, they would become ""the Williamses"" in a plural sense. If you wanted to reference their dog, you'd say ""the Williamses' dog."" If the last name seems awkward to say that way, sidestep the issue by saying ""the Williams family"" and ""the Williams family's dog.""
If you're listing who owns an object, know where to put the apostrophe. For instance, if both John and Mary own a cat, you would write ""John and Mary's cat"" — not ""John's and Mary's cat."" ""John and Mary"" is a cohesive noun phrase, and therefore only needs one apostrophe.

, The wrong use of an apostrophe to form the plural is called the greengrocer's apostrophe, since grocers are often the worst (or at least the most visible) offenders.If you have more than one apple, then write apples, not apple's.

An occasional exception to this use is in the case of making a single letter plural. Therefore, Why are there so many i's in the word ""indivisibility""? is correct, depending on who you ask.This is simply for clarity reasons, so the reader does not mistake it for the word ""is."" However, in modern usage, the preference is to avoid inserting an apostrophe and instead surround the single letter in quotation marks before pluralizing it: Why are there so many ""i""s in the word ""indivisibility""?

Avoid the problem altogether with small numbers by spelling out the word: ""ones"" instead of ""1's,"" ""fours"" instead of ""4's"" or ""nines"" instead of ""9's."" Only spell out words of numerals that are ten or lower.

, Say you use an acronym for a noun, like CD. To make CD plural, use ""CDs,"" not CD's."" The same logic goes for years — instead of writing ""Spandex was popular in the 1980's,"" use ""1980s.""

The only time an apostrophe should be used in a year is if it's standing in for omitted numbers. For instance, if you wanted to shorten the year 2005, you could write '05. In this case, the apostrophe is essentially acting like it does in a contraction and serving as shorthand.

, Sometimes, especially in informal writing, apostrophes are used to indicate one or more missing letters. For example, the word ""don't"" is short for ""do not""; other examples include ""isn't,"" ""wouldn't,"" and ""can't."" Contractions can also be made with the verbs ""is,"" ""has,"" and ""have."" For example, we can write ""She's going to school"" instead of ""She is going to school""; or ""He's lost the game"" instead of ""He has lost the game."", Use an apostrophe with the word ""it"" only when you want to indicate a contraction for ""it is"" or ""it has. It is a pronoun, and pronouns have their own possessive form that does not use an apostrophe. For example, ""That noise? It's just the dog eating its bone."" This may seem confusing, but it follows the same pattern as other possessive pronouns: his, hers, its, yours, ours, theirs.
, Many people use informal contractions such as ""shouldn't've"" or ""'ought."" These contractions aren't real contractions, so avoid using them in formal writing.  Another mistake to avoid is using people's names in contractions. For example, if you use ""Bob's"" as a contraction of ""Bob is,"" then that's not correct. ""Bob's"" is supposed to be a possessive, not a contraction. It's okay to use pronouns in contractions such as ""he's"" or ""she's."", Example: You are trying to write she's. Write shes first and then add the apostrophe."

Use em dashes to substitute for missing information.",How to Hyphenate," One of the most common, important uses of hyphens is to string together related words and concepts to form single words and unified phrases. For example, terms like ""state-of-the-art"", ""first-timer"", and ""penny-pincher"" all use hyphens to create a single idea from multiple words.


Here are a few examples of hyphens being used correctly in compound words:

The singer was infamous for his over-reliance on autotune.


That ten-year-old is remarkably mature for her age.


As a general rule, you should never put spaces around a hyphen (e.g., write ""ten-year-old"", not ""ten - year - old."";
, Most words with prefixes, like ""predetermined"" and ""evermore"" don't need hyphens. However, some prefixes (namely, ""ex-"", ""self-"", ""all-"", and sometimes ""cross-"") need hyphens to separate them from the word they're modifying. Note that ""cross"" doesn't need to be hyphenated in words like ""crossword,"" where it is part of the word itself, nor in terms like ""cross purposes,"" where it is a separate word, as it's not being used as a prefix in these cases.


Here is an example of a hyphen being used for prefixes:

She frequently accused her ex-boyfriend of being completely self-absorbed.



, Similar to the way they are used for compound words, hyphens can also be used to create descriptive, colorful terms that may not be found in the dictionary. Hyphens used in this way allow you to create your own words from scratch. However, it's important to remember not to rely too heavily on unique hyphenated words, as this can become distracting. If you can convey your ideas just as well with one or more normal words, do so.


Here is an example of a unique hyphenated word used well:

Kim took time off from her job and became a professional couch-sitter in the days just before giving birth.


Here is an example of a unique hyphenated word being used in a way that's not necessary. In this case, the hyphens don't make the term any easier to understand.

I couldn't decide what to get at the pizza place, so I ordered my usual three-cheese-no-meat combo.



, Some words are hyphenated when neglecting the hyphen would make the meaning of the word unclear. For instance, to convey the idea of a duplicate or replica, a writer may use the word ""re-creation"" in place of ""recreation"" because the latter can also mean ""fun"" or ""entertainment"". Hyphens can also be used in a similar way to make compound words more visually appealing in cases where the first word ends with the same letter that the second starts with.


Here are a few examples of hyphens used for clarity. In the first, ""re-signed"" has a different meaning than ""resigned"" and ""foreign-film theater"" has a less ambiguous meaning than ""foreign film theater"". In the second, the hyphen separates the first ""e"" from the second.

Jeremy re-signed his contract, then took the train to the foreign-film theater to celebrate.


After the convicts passed a compulsory period of good behavior, the re-education program began in earnest.



, Though the rules for when to use numerals and when to spell out numbers can vary from style guide to style guide, many grammatical sources will recommend using a hyphen for two-word numbers below one hundred. In other words, use hyphens for the numbers twenty-one through ninety-nine, with the exceptions of thirty, forty, fifty, etc. This also means that after one hundred, you'll still use hyphens between the numbers in the ""tens"" and ""ones"" places (e.g. ""two hundred twenty-two"").


Here is an example of correct number hyphenation:

The wedding reception had eighty-eight guests, but the cooks only prepared seventy-nine entrees.



, When writing fractions out as words, rather than writing them as numerals, you should separate the two numbers in the fraction with a hyphen. This rule is true even for mixed fractions (fractions preceded by a whole number, like ""three and five-sixths"").


Here is an example of hyphens used correctly in two fractions:

The snickerdoodle recipe calls for two and two-thirds cups of flour and two and one-quarter cups of sugar.



, When someone has two last names (usually because his or her parents kept their own last names after marriage), the names are hyphenated. In rare cases where someone has three or more last names, all of the names are hyphenated.


Here is an example of hyphens used correctly for last names:

When Suzie Sanders-Johnson and Tim Rodriguez-Lyle had their first child, they weren't sure what his last name would be.



, In cases where a sentence calls for a list of hyphenated words or numbers that share a common word, it's usually OK to write the word only for the last item in the list. For the other items in the list, write the word or number followed by a hyphen. Separate each item with a comma as you normally would in a list.


Here is an example of hyphens used in a list:

For this construction project, we're going to need plenty of ten-, twenty-, and fifty-inch boards.



, If you're ever unsure of when (or when not) to use a hyphen, consult a reference source for guidance. A wide variety of grammar references are available both in print, in libraries or book stores, and online. Be sure to choose a reference source that's well-qualified and professional. It's hard to go wrong with the ""big three"" style guides: APA Style, MLA Style, and Chicago/Turabian Style.


Note that minor differences may exist between the style guides you consult. For instance, the MLA style guide allows you to use hyphens for expressing number ranges (e.g., 350-400 degrees), while the Chicago style guide recommends an en dash., Some words which are technically compound words have become so commonplace and well-known that hyphenating them can actually make their meaning less clear. For example, ""lunchtime"" and ""roommate"" don't need to be hyphenated, as these common words' meanings are perfectly clear without hyphens. Note that in some cases, hyphens are optional: both ""high school"" and ""high-school"" are generally considered acceptable.


Here is an example of compound words that don't need hyphens:

I will read you a story at bedtime, but only if you correct the misprints in your book report .



, As noted above, except in some exceptional cases, most words with prefixes don't need hyphens and will look cumbersome if an unnecessary hyphen is added. There are too many of these ""normal"" prefixes that don't require a hyphen to list, but here are just a few: ""pre-"", ""post-"", ""non-"", ""un-"", ""anti-"", ""re-"", ""bi-"", ""di-"", and ""de-"".Here is an example of words with prefixes that don't need hyphens:

The recycled paper was strangely unaffected by the heat of the fire.



, When a compound word or phrase can be used as both a verb and a noun or adjective, you generally shouldn't include a hyphen if the word is used as a verb. For instance, the term ""back up"" can be used as a verb and a noun to mean both ""to make a copy of something for safekeeping"" and ""a copy of something"", respectively. Thus, you would write ""back up"" as a verb like this: ""Please back up your hard disk data,"" and write it as a noun like this: ""He is our back-up plan if the other candidate doesn't want the job.""


Here is an example of a verb that doesn't need a hyphen:

Tell the repairman to fix it.


However, the same phrase can use a hyphen when it becomes an adjective:

Call our usual fix-it guy, please.



, Some words, like ""today"" and ""tonight"", were once hyphenated like normal compound words. This is generally not done in modern writing, so you shouldn't feel any need to include these superfluous hyphens unless you're specifically trying to mimic an old-fashioned tone or style.


Here is an example of words that once used hyphens but do not today:

I shall meet you tomorrow at sunup when the cock crows and not one moment sooner.



, Though hyphens are used to construct many compound words and phrases, you shouldn't use them after adverbs that end with ""-ly"", like ""softly"", ""strongly"", and ""deftly"", and after the word ""very"" when it's used as an adverb. Note, however, that you can use hyphens after words that end with ""-ly"" if they aren't adverbs, like ""family"", ""barely"", and so on. As a reminder, adverbs are words that modify or qualify a verb, adjective, or another adverb.Here is an example of adverbs that don't need a hyphen:

The quickly drying paint was bone dry within the hour.


Note that hyphens can be used correctly after a word ending in ""-ly"" that is not an adverb:

The little boy reached toward the friendly-looking rabbit without fear.



, When you use a compound adjective to compare two or more things or ideas, you shouldn't use a hyphen. This rule stems from the fact that the meaning of these types of adjectives is clear without the aid of a hyphen. For instance, you would never say that one house is ""better-constructed than the other"", but saying that a house is ""better constructed than the other"" is just fine.


Here are a few examples of comparative and superlative adjectives that don't need hyphens:

After the boxing match, one fighter was clearly more bruised than the other.


Even the best laid plans sometimes go awry.



, Though it's usually somewhat rare that a person with a non-technical background might have to write at length about chemistry-related topics, it's still useful to note that the names of specific chemicals don't contain hyphens. This is true even for chemicals with long names containing multiple prefixes, like monochloroacetic acid.


Here is an example of chemical names where hyphens are not needed:

After adding the cyclopentane to the Erlenmeyer flask, the scientist stirred in 5 milliliters of hydrochloric acid.



, Two symbols called the en dash and the em dash resemble the hyphen but are used for different purposes. En dashes (""–"") are slightly longer than a hyphen, while em dashes (""—"") are even longer. In informal writing, you can usually get away with using hyphens and dashes interchangeably, but in formal contexts, you'll want to keep the uses of each distinct, as it can be considered a grammar error to do so. Following these general rules can help you keep your use of hyphens and dashes distinct. Below are a few of the situations in which you'll need to use dashes:


Ranges of dates, numbers, times, and values (en dashes)
Prefixes for words which don't usually have them (en dashes)
Substituting for blank or missing content (em dashes)
Abrupt sentence interruptions (em dashes)
Punctuating a sentence with extra information (em dashes)

, En dashes are often used to express the idea that two or more words or numbers are connected by a range of values in between. For instance, in the sentence ""We just delivered the Jan–Apr issue,"" the dash implies that the magazine is for January through April, not just January and April. Note that when using en dashes for ranges, you shouldn't put a space on either side of the dash.


Here is an example of an en dash used to express a range:

Would you please schedule me an appointment for 1:00–2:00 PM?



, In general cases, you shouldn't use any sort of punctuation mark for common prefixes like ""pre-"", ""post-"", ""re-"", and so on. However, when connecting this sort of prefix to a word like a proper noun, a complex phrase, or a word that would look awkward or cumbersome without some sort of separating mark, it's acceptable to use an en dash. Obviously, however, en dashes shouldn't be used for words like ""preselect"" or ""postgame"" where the meaning is already clear.


Here are a few examples of en dashes used to attach prefixes:

The professor's degree in the pre–Cold War history of Russia qualified him to teach his course on Czar Nicholas II.


Post–Andy Kaufman, the comedy landscape just didn't seem as vivid.



, Em dashes can be used to abruptly break the flow of a sentence to convey related information, add commentary, and more. Em dashes used in this way can either come before the words inserted into the middle of the sentence or before and after them if the original sentence continues after the interruption. Unlike typical hyphen and dash usage, some grammatical resources allow you to separate em dashes from the rest of the sentence with spaces when used this way.Below are a few examples of em dashes used to interrupt sentences:

Deborah — who was nineteen — still loved the swings at the local park.


There's no need to lock the door — I'm coming out after you.



, Em dashes can also be used at the end of a sentence to show that the flow of words has abruptly ceased before the sentence would normally have ended. In this case, you shouldn't end the sentence with a period, question mark, or exclamation point as you normally would. This is an especially useful tool for written dialog, as it allows you to show when one character interrupts another by speaking over him.


Here's an example of an em dash being used to show someone's speech being interrupted:

Where are we going? The police are right --—"" ""Shh! They'll hear you.""



, In some cases, when information is intentionally left out, it's acceptable to use one or more em dashes to substitute for the missing words or letters. Often, this is used in citations: some style guides call for three em dashes to be used in place of an author's name when it needs to be listed many times in a row.This can also be used to ""censor"" the names of people or places to keep them confidential.


Here is an example of an em dash being used to substitute for missing information:

The paranormal incident took place in the night sky just outside of the rural town of N——.

Use the slash when quoting lyrics and poetry to denote a line break.,
Also use the slash to replace the word and when joining two nouns.,
Use the double quotation mark ( "" ) to enclose a direct quotation derived from either a spoken or written source.,
Use parentheses to clarify.,
Use parentheses to denote an afterthought.,
Use parentheses for personal comments.,
Use brackets to signify an editor's note in a regular piece of writing.,
Use braces to denote a numeric set in mathematics.",How to Use English Punctuation Correctly," Unless you're an avant-garde poet or you're starting a sentence with a brand name like ""wikiHow"" or ""iPod,"" you will need to capitalize the first letter of every sentence.


Here is an example of proper capitalization at the beginning of a sentence:

She invited her friend over after school.



, In addition to starting sentences, capital letters should also occur at the start of proper nouns and titles. Proper nouns are the names of specific people, places, and things. Titles, which are a type of proper noun, are the names of works of art (books, movies, plays, etc.), institutions, geographical areas, and much more. Titles can also be honorifics (Her Majesty, Mr. President, etc.).

Titles and proper nouns consisting of more than one word should have every word capitalized, except for small words and articles like ""the,"" ""an,"" ""and,"" etc. The first word of a title should always be capitalized (with the above ""brand name"" exception).
Here are a few examples of capital letters being used for proper nouns and titles:

Genghis Khan quickly became the most powerful man in Asia, if not the world.


In her opinion, Queen Roberta's favorite museum in the world is the Smithsonian, which she visited during her trip to Washington, D.C., last year.



, An acronym is a word (or a ""coined"" word) formed from the first letter of every word in a long proper noun or title. Acronyms are frequently used to shorten long proper nouns that would be awkward to reprint in their entirety every time they are mentioned. Sometimes the letters of an acronym are separated by periods.

Here is an example of acronyms made from capital letters:

The CIA and the NSA are just two of the USA's many intelligence agencies.



, Also after initials, as in Alfred D. Smith. Every sentence contains at least one punctuation mark -- the one at its end. The most common of these sentence-ending punctuation marks is the period (""."", also called a ""full stop""). This simple dot is used to mark the end of a sentence that is declarative. Most sentences are declarative. Any sentence that states a fact or describes or explains an idea is declarative.


Here is an example of a period (full stop) being used correctly at the end of a sentence:

The accessibility of the computer has increased tremendously over the past several years.



, The question mark ( ""?"" ) used at the end of a sentence denotes an interrogative sentence -- basically, a question. Use this punctuation mark at the end of any question, query, or inquiry.

Here is an example of a question mark being used correctly at the end of a sentence:

What has humanity done about the growing concern regarding global warming?



, The exclamation point (""!"", also called an ""exclamation mark"" or ""shout mark"") suggests excitement or strong emphasis. The exclamation point is used to end exclamations -- short expressions of intense emotion that are often only one word long.

Here are two examples of an exclamation point being used correctly at the end of a sentence:

I can't believe how difficult the exam was!


Eek! You scared me!



, The comma ("","") is a very versatile punctuation mark. There are dozens of situations that might require the use of a comma. One frequent case is the appositive -- a break within a sentence that supplements and adds information to the subject.

Here is an example of commas being used to create a break in a sentence:

Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft, is the developer of the operating system known as Windows.



, A common use of commas is to separate items that are being listed in a sequence. Usually commas are written between each of the items and between the second-to-last item and a subsequent conjunction.

However, many writers omit the comma before the conjunction (called a serial comma or ""Oxford comma""), as conjunctions like ""and"" will signal the end of the list even without the final comma.
Here are two examples of commas used in listed series -- one with an Oxford Comma and one without.

The fruit basket contained apples, bananas, and oranges.


The computer store was filled with video games, computer hardware and other electronic paraphernalia.



, Sometimes consecutive adjectives are used to describe a single subject with multiple qualities. This use of commas is similar to using them to separate items in a series, with one exception: it is incorrect to place a comma after the final adjective.

Here are examples of correct and incorrect comma usage when it comes to separating adjectives:

CORRECT: The powerful, resonating sound caught our attention.


INCORRECT: The powerful, resonating, sound caught our attention.



, Specific geographical places or areas are usually named by starting with the smallest location's name and then proceeding to the larger area. For instance, you might refer to a specific city by naming the city itself, followed by the state or province it is in, followed by the surrounding country. Each geographic name (except the last) is followed by a comma. Note that a comma is used after the last (largest) geographical area if the sentence continues.

Here are two examples of correct comma usage when it comes to naming geographical areas:

I am originally from Hola, Tana River County, Kenya.


Los Angeles, California, is one of the largest cities in the United States.



, An introductory phrase (which is usually one or more prepositional phrases) briefly introduces the sentence and provides context but is not part of the sentence's subject or predicate. Therefore, it should be separated from the main clause by a comma.

Here are two examples of sentences with introductory phrases separated from the rest of the sentence by commas:

After the show, John and I went out to dinner.


On the back of my couch, my cat's claws have slowly been carving a large hole.



, Having two independent clauses in a sentence simply means that you could split the sentence into two shorter sentences while preserving the original meaning. If your sentence contains two independent clauses that are separated by a conjunction (such as and, as, but, for, nor, so, or yet), place a comma before the conjunction.

Here are two examples of sentences containing independent clauses:

Ryan went to the beach yesterday, but he forgot his sunscreen.


Water bills usually rise during the summer, as people are thirstier during hot and humid days.



, When calling one's attention by saying his/her name at the start of a sentence, separate the person's name from the rest of the sentence with a comma. Note that this comma is somewhat rare in writing, because this is something normally done while speaking. It's more common for a writer to employ other methods to indicate who is speaking to whom.

Here is an example of a direct address:

Amber, could you come here for a moment?



, A comma should occur after the word immediately preceding a quotation that is being introduced with context or a description. On the other hand, it is not necessary to use a comma before an indirect quote (where you are paraphrasing someone's words without quoting them exactly). Additionally, a comma is usually not necessary if you are not quoting an entire statement, but only a few words from it.

Here is an example of a direct quotation that requires a comma:

While I was at his house, John asked, ""Do you want anything to eat?""


Here is an example of an indirect quotation that does not require a comma:

While I was at his house, John asked me if I wanted anything to eat.


Here is an example of a partial direct quotation, which, due to its brevity and its use within the sentence, does not require a comma:

According to the client, the lawyer was ""lazy and incompetent.""



, The proper use of a semicolon is similar, but not identical, to that of a comma. The semicolon marks the end of one independent clause and the start of another within a single sentence. Note that, if the two clauses are very wordy or complex, it is better to use a period (full stop) and form two sentences instead.


Here's an example of a semicolon being used correctly:

People continue to worry about the future; our failure to conserve resources has put the world at risk.



, Usually, the items in a series are separated by commas, but for cases in which one or more items require comment or explanation, semicolons can be used in conjunction with commas to keep the reader from becoming confused. Use semicolons to separate items and their explanations from one another. To separate an item from its own explanation, use a comma.

Here's an example of semicolons being used correctly in a list whose meaning might otherwise be ambiguous:

I went to the show with Jake, my close friend; his friend, Jane; and her best friend, Jenna.



, Be careful, however, not to use a colon when stating an idea that requires naming a series of items. The two are similar, but distinct. Often the sentence-ending words ""the following"" or ""as follows"" will call for the use of a colon when they are followed by new, explanatory information.

Here's an example of a colon being used correctly in this fashion:

The professor has given me three options: to retake the exam, to accept the extra credit assignment, or to fail the class.


Here, on the other hand, is an incorrect example:

The Easter basket contained: Easter eggs, chocolate rabbits, and other candy. In this case you would simply omit the colon.



, Colons can also be used after a descriptive phrase or explanation to imply that the next piece of information will be the thing being described or explained. It can help to think of this as introducing a list containing only one item.

Here's an example of a colon being used properly in this way:

There's only one person old enough to remember that wedding: grandma.



, Some works of art, particularly books and movies, can have long, subdivided titles. In these cases, what follows the main title is called a subtitle. Use colons to separate them.

Here's an example of colons being used in this way to subdivide lengthy titles:

Fred's favorite movie was The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, though Stacy preferred its sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.



, The purpose of this hyphen is to make the word easier to read. For instance, if you were to leave the hyphen out of the word re-examine, it would be reexamine, where the double ""e"" could be confusing. Many words do not require a hyphen to separate the prefix from the word, such as restate, pretest, and undo. Let a dictionary be your guide for when to use the hyphen after a prefix.


Here's an example of good hyphen usage:

Cara is his ex-girlfriend.



, If you've ever written about anything that's gold-plated, radar-equipped, or one-size-fits-all, you've used a hyphen in this way. To build a long, descriptive word out of two or more component words, use hyphens to separate the ""pieces"" from each other.

Here's an example of a hyphen used to build a compound word:

The up-to-date newspaper reporters were quick to jump on the latest scandal.



, Separate the two words of any number under one hundred with a hyphen. Be careful with spelling out numbers above one hundred — if the number is used as an adjective, it is completely hyphenated, since all compound adjectives are hyphenated. (This is the one-hundredth episode). Otherwise, a hyphen should occur only if a number lower than 100 is embedded within a larger number, e.g., He lived to be one hundred twenty-one.

Don't use ""and"" when writing numbers, as in ""The amount is one hundred and eighty."" This is a common error in the US and Canada, where the ""and"" is usually omitted. Elsewhere in the English-speaking world, however, the ""and"" can be included.
Here are two examples of hyphens being used in numbers below and above one hundred, respectively:

There are fifty-two playing cards in a deck.


The packaging advertised one thousand two hundred twenty-four firecrackers, but it contained only one thousand.



, The dash (""--"" or ""—"") is slightly longer than the hyphen and is used to convey a sudden change of thought, an additional comment, or a dramatic qualification within a sentence. It can also be used to add a parenthetical statement for further clarification, but this should still be relevant to the sentence. Otherwise, use parentheses. Keep in mind that the rest of the sentence should still flow naturally as if the dashed material were not there.

To judge whether a dash is appropriate, try to remove the words between the dashes. If the sentence appears disjointed or does not make sense, you may need to revise it instead of using the dashes.
There should be spaces before and after a dash in British English.
Here are two examples of proper dash usage:

An introductory clause is a brief phrase that comes — yes, you guessed it — at the beginning of a sentence.


This is the end of our sentence — or so we thought.



, Though this use is not as common today, the hyphen (""-"") was once a common punctuation mark on typewriters, used when a long word had to be split between two lines. This system is still seen in some books, but the justification capacity of computer word processing programs has made this rarer.

Here's an example of a hyphen being used to split a word that's cut into two pieces by a line break:

No matter what he tried, he just couldn't get the novel's elec-
trifying surprise ending out of his head.



, The apostrophe ("" ' "") has a variety of uses for conveying the concept of possession. Be aware of the difference in using an apostrophe with singular or plural nouns. A singular noun will use the apostrophe before the ""s"" ('s), whereas the plural version of that noun will use the apostrophe after the ""s"" (s'). This use comes with several stipulations discussed below.

Be mindful of nouns that are always considered to be plural, such as children and people. Here you should use 's even though the nouns are plural.
Also be aware of pronouns that are already possessive and do not require apostrophes, such as hers and its. (It's means it is or it has). Their is possessive without apostrophe or s, except as a predicate adjective, where it becomes theirs.
Here is an example of an apostrophe used to show possession with a singular noun:

The hamster's water tube needs to be refilled.


Here is an example of an apostrophe used for showing possession with a plural noun:

In the pet store, the hamsters' bedding needed to be changed.


Here is an example of an apostrophe used for showing possession with a plural noun that doesn't end with ""s"":

These children's test scores are the highest in the nation.



, Contractions are shortened combinations of two words. For example, cannot becomes can't, ""it is"" becomes ""it's"", you are becomes you're, and ""they have"" becomes they've. In every contraction, the apostrophe replaces the letters that are omitted from one or both words.

Be sure to use the possessive pronoun your and the contraction you're appropriately. It is a common mistake to interchange them.
Here is an example of apostrophes used for a contraction of it is and a singular noun with possession, while correctly being omitted for possessive pronouns (hers, theirs, its):

Friends of hers explained that it's her idea, not theirs, to refill the hamster's water tube and change its bedding.



, Single quotation marks, which look almost identical to apostrophes, are used to separate quotations from other quotations which surround them. Use these carefully: always make sure every quotation mark used to start a quote is paired with a corresponding one at the end of the quote.

Here is an example of a quote-within-a-quote:

Ali said, ""Anna told me, 'I wasn't sure if you wanted to come!'""



, This is a very common mistake. Remember that apostrophes are not used to show the simple pluralization of a noun.

Here are examples of correct and incorrect apostrophe usage:

CORRECT - apple → apples


INCORRECT - apple → apple's



, Slashes ( "" / "" ) in phrases like and/or suggest that the options described are not mutually exclusive.


Here is an example of good ""and/or"" usage:

To register, you will need your driver's license and/or your birth certificate.



, Slashes are especially useful when it is impractical to recreate the original formatting of a poem or song. When using slashes in this way, be sure to include spaces before and after the slashes.

Here is an example of slashes used to mark line breaks in a song:

Row, row, row your boat / Gently down the stream. / Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, / Life is but a dream.



, By replacing and with a slash, you suggest that there is equal importance in both options listed. Use these replacements in moderation to place greater emphasis where and may not do so, as well as to avoid confusing the reader. You can also do the same for or, as in his/her. However, you should not use the slash to separate independent clauses.

Here are examples of how to use and how not to use a slash in this way:

CORRECT:""The student and part-time employee has very little free time."" →""The student/part-time employee has very little free time.""


INCORRECT:""Do you want to go to the grocery store, or would you prefer to go to the mall?"" →""Do you want to go to the grocery store / would you prefer to go to the mall?""



, Generally speaking, quotation marks are used to denote that the information is a quote. In other words, whether you're recreating someone's verbal speech or simply re-writing something that they wrote elsewhere, you'll use quotation marks.


Below are two examples of quotation mark usage:

""I can't wait to see him perform!"" John exclaimed.


According to the article, the value of the dollar in developing nations is ""strongly influenced by its aesthetic value, rather than its face value.""



, Parentheses are often used to explain something that can't be deduced from the rest of the sentence. When using parentheses ( "" ( ) "" ), be sure to include the sentence's period after the closing parenthesis, except in the case that an entire sentence is within parentheses. Note that sometimes parentheses and commas can be used interchangeably.


Here is an example of parentheses used for clarification:

Steve Case (AOL's former CEO) resigned from the Time-Warner board of directors in 2005.



, Parentheses can also be used to contain information that is supplementary to the sentence they are part of. In this case, the line between using parentheses and starting a new sentence instead can be somewhat murky. A good general rule is to use parentheses for short additions and quips, not complex ideas.

Here is an example of parentheses used for an afterthought. Note that the period (full stop) follows the last parenthesis — not before the first. Also note that replacing the parentheses with a comma may not be entirely suitable here, while a period or a semicolon may work:

You will need a flashlight for the camping trip (don't forget the batteries!).



, One additional usage of parentheses is to contain the writer's direct comments to the reader. Usually, the comments contained in parentheses refer to the preceding sentence. As above, the shorter and simpler the better. If you have to expound at great length or reference several disparate pieces of your writing, it's usually best to start a new sentence.

Here is an example of parentheses used for a personal comment:

Most grammarians believe that parentheses and commas are always interchangeable (I disagree).



, You can also use brackets ( "" "" ) to clarify or to revise a direct quote. Brackets are often used to encompass the word ""sic"" (Latin for thus), indicating that the previous word or phrase was presented ""as is,"" retaining an error in the original version.

Here is an example of brackets used for clarity in a direct quote. (Note that the original quote was, ""It was absolutely devastating!"")

""'was absolutely devastating!' said Susan Smith, a local bystander at the scene of the incident.



, Less commonly, braces ( "" { } "" ) can also be used in regular writing to indicate a set of equal, independent choices.

Here are two examples of brace usage. Note that the second is exceedingly rare:

The set of numbers in this problem is: { 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 }


Choose your favorite utensil { fork, knife, spoon } and bring it to me.

Note the point of using a question mark.,
Use the question mark as an indicator of interrogation.,
Use question marks for rhetorical questions.,
Know how to insert question marks into a sentence.,
Use a question mark to show doubt or uncertainty.,
Use question marks in titles where the phrase is only completed by the question mark.,
Introduce a question into a longer sentence.,
Avoid misuse of question marks.",How to Use Question Marks," The primary purpose of a question mark is to indicate that the sentence is a question. It's also useful for demonstrating surprise, skepticism, uncertainty, and the unknown.

, At its most basic, if you're asking a direct question awaiting an answer, you need a question mark:


How is your sore throat?
Are the roses wilting?
When will you be home?
What is the name of the company you work for?
Where were you on the night of February 14, 2007?
Who were you with?
What were you doing?
How are question marks supposed to be used?
Why do people think that rhetorical questions don't end with a question mark?
Use the question mark for incomplete questions too, such as: ""Huh? Really? No joke?"", Although it is sometimes assumed that rhetorical questions don't require a question mark, they do. In the sentence, ""Isn't that ironic?, for example, an exclamation mark could be used instead, to emphasize the speaker's surprise. Here are some examples of rhetorical questions requiring the interrogation point:


Are you kidding me?
How should I know?
What's the use?
Who cares?

, The question mark can be used within a sentence (not just at the end of it) if wished, although you might prefer to use commas and leave the question mark for the end of the sentence – it's your choice, as both ways are correct. For example, take the situation of someone leaving their house in a hurry before a disaster and wondering what they might have time to take with them. The sentence could be written both of the following ways, noting that the second way provides a lot more emphasis:


Would I have time to take my car, my horse, my photo album, my laptop, my favorite clothes and jewelry?
Would I have time to take my car? my horse? my photo album? my laptop? my favorite clothes and jewelry? Note that you do not need capital letters as it remains one sentence.In this sentence, the question marks are known as ""interrupters"" and either emphasize each of the separate question fragments, or show the close-linked nature of them., If there is something stated in a sentence that is unknown, it is appropriate to highlight this fact using a question mark. This is useful for writing up meeting notes, birth and death dates where they are unknown or unverifiable, making editor's notes, etc. Use parentheses, use sparingly, and only use in the right context, such as about a point of fact. Here are some examples:


Fred was a feisty sailor (? - 1686). Note that this type of question mark is not an end point, hence the need for a period if you say: Fred was born in 1625 (?).His ancestor (Fred Barnstar?) was a feisty sailor who died in 1686.
Mr Barnstar said he'd pay the council (?) dollars to remove the offending graffiti from his garage door, even though he thought it was already covered by his taxes.
Editor's note: ""The cat was able to regurgitate a (?) onto the floor.""

, For example: ""How to Watch Do You Want to Be a Millionaire?"", Sometimes it's appropriate to introduce a question within a long sentence. Simply use a comma and start the question fragment with a capital letter:


The question was, What was I to do with a rotten apple?
I asked, ""What am I supposed to do with a rotten apple?"" This is the best construction for the introduction of a quote.
Where the introduction is a complete sentence, it's better to use a colon instead – The question I asked my teacher was this: How should I use a rotten apple?, There are occasions where the use of the question mark might seem appropriate but isn't correct. A question mark is not used when asking someone to do something, or to make requests. In the book ""Punctuation Pointers"", Maxwell Nurnberg states: ""We do not use the question mark when we are merely making a request or when we expect no answer."" Here are some examples where it's essential to avoid misusing a question mark:


Where the question asked is indirect, namely it implies a question instead of expressing it, or describes a question without actually asking it directly, there is no need for a question mark. For example:

We may expect word from you shortly.
He asked me why I was no longer skydiving.
She asked if she could leave her gift at the door.


Where it is a courtesy question, general practice tends to drop the question mark. Note, however, that these kinds of sentences (namely, requests in the form of a question) occur much more frequently in speech than in writing. Question marks, of course, don't apply to speech, except when it's transcribed. For example:

Would you please send us a duplicate copy of that invoice.
Will you please read the transcript back to me.
May we have the pleasure of hearing from you soon.
Can I please look at that book.


Avoid using more than one question mark unless you're texting or actively seeking to drive your reader up the proverbial wall. While writing ""Don't you like popular people?????"" seems emphatic, it's incorrect for all but the most informal of writing.

"
"
Do not use a comma just because your sentence is long.,
Avoid using commas to signify pauses.,
Do not always use a comma with a person’s name.,
Understand that commas are complex but manageable.",How to Use Commas1," This is a common mistake: sometimes, people will see a long sentence and put in commas to “break it up” even if the sentence is grammatical without them. The length of your sentence has nothing to do with whether or not it needs commas., Some writers believe that a pause or breath indicates where a comma should be placed. However, because people read and speak differently, this method is unreliable and often results in mistakes.


This technique may be acceptable to signal pauses when writing dialogue in fiction.

, This is another common comma error, but don’t be fooled: you only need to use a comma with the person’s name if the phrase serves as a non-restrictive modifier.


For example, this is common but incorrect comma usage: “Abraham Lincoln, was the 16th President of the United States.” Abraham Lincoln is the subject of that sentence and is an essential element.
An example of correct comma usage with a name would look like this: “Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was a lawyer before he became president.” In this case, the 16th president of the United States is a non-restrictive clause (meaning the sentence makes sense if it’s removed) and is set off with commas on both sides.

, Another very common comma myth is that commas are a kind of grammatical magic that is impossible to accurately predict or learn. While the logic governing comma usage can seem complicated, most of the time, it’s actually easy to learn where they go if you know a few rules."

Use quotation marks for the title of a poem, short story, or essay.,
Apply quotation marks to the title of a book chapter or an article.,
Use quotation marks to title of a song, a television episode, or a commercial.,
Add quotation marks to the title of a blog entry and any unpublished works.,
Apply quotations to in-text titles for APA style.",How to Punctuate Titles1," In MLA style, you always use quotation marks to notate the title of a poem if you are citing it as a reference in a bibliography or if you are citing your own original work. For example, “The Raven” by Edgar Allen Poe or “Today is a Good Day” by Mark Smith.You also use quotation marks for the titles of short stories. For example, “Cathedral” by Raymond Carver or “Coyotes” by Jo Ann Beard.
This rule also applies to the title of an essay. For example, “Politics and the English Language” by George Orwell.;
, If you are citing the title of a book chapter or an article from a journal, magazine, newspaper, or periodical, you will use quotation marks. This applies to original works and published works.For example, if you are citing a chapter title in Moby Dick, you would cite it as “The Carpet-Bag” chapter in Moby Dick.
If you are citing an article title in a travel journal, it would appear as “Rivers of China” or “Top Hikes in Oregon”. A newspaper article title would appear as “Woman Missing on Hiking Trail”.

, If you are trying to format the title of a song, a television episode, or a television commercial, you should use quotation marks. For example, “I Did It My Way”, “Obey Your Thirst”, or “The One Where the Monkey Gets Away”.You should also use quotations for the title of a skit or a monologue. For example, “The Bar Skit”.

, If you are trying to format a blog entry title, add quotation marks. For example, “Meet My New Cat” or “Today’s the Day”.If you have any unpublished works that you are titling, such as manuscripts, speeches, lectures, dissertations, or theses, you should use quotation marks. For example, “My Speech on Human Rights” or “A Lecture on Bees”.

, APA style is different from MLA style in that it has different rules for titles that are in text and titles that are listed in references or in a bibliography. In text, you should use quotation marks around titles of shorter works, such as articles, chapters, or essays. For example, “Breaking the Psyche in Adolescents”.In your references or bibliography, you would use plain text for the titles of shorter works, with no quotation marks. For example, Breaking the Psyche in Adolescents.

Understand what a relative clause is.,
Understand how non-restrictive modifiers work.,
Use commas with non-restrictive modifiers.,
Use commas to offset expressions that interrupt the sentence.,
Understand how restrictive modifiers work.,
Avoid using commas with restrictive modifiers.",How to Use Commas2," A relative clause is a word, clause, or phrase that modifies some element of the main clause. Relative clauses are introduced by relative pronouns. Common relative pronouns include who/whom, whoever/whomever, whose, that, and which. In general, they come in two types: non-restrictive and restrictive., Non-restrictive modifiers are relative clauses or phrases that add information to a sentence but aren’t essential to the meaning of the sentence. If you removed a non-restrictive modifier from the sentence, it would still make sense (and the main subject of the sentence would still be in place). They are also sometimes called “interrupters.”Here is an example of a non-restrictive modifier in a sentence: “George Washington, our first president, served two terms.” While the information in the non-restrictive modifier is helpful, the main clause makes sense if it’s removed: “George Washington served two terms.”
Here is another example of a non-restrictive modifier: “Fatima, who has been studying hard, will probably do well on today’s exam.” The presence of who (a relative pronoun) in a clause is often a sign that it’s non-restrictive and should be set off by commas.

, In almost all cases, non-restrictive clauses or phrases will be set off on both sides by commas. This indicates to the reader that they’re additional information, but not necessarily essential. If you can remove the clause without damaging the sense of your sentence, it is almost certainly a non-restrictive modifier.


Make sure to set off the entire modifier with commas, using one at each end. A common comma error is to set off the beginning of the modifier with a comma, but not the end.
In almost all cases, relative clauses or phrases beginning with which will be non-restrictive modifiers and should be set off with commas: “The car accident, which occurred at 3 PM, didn’t damage my car too badly.”

, Sometimes, prepositional phrases and other phrases interrupt the main sentence, serving as non-restrictive modifiers. If these interruptions are separate from the main subject and verb, separate the interruption phrase with commas to signal to the reader that this information is inessential.


For example, here is an example of a prepositional phrase acting as an interrupter: “It is, in my opinion, an excellent book.” This phrase isn’t crucial to the meaning, and can be taken out without damage to the sentence.
Here is another example: “This road, on the other hand, is well-paved and easy to drive.”
Direct address also falls into this category. For example, here is a sentence interrupted by a direct address to another person: “That's why I'm appointing you, Thomas, leader of the group.”

, Restrictive modifiers are relative clauses or phrases that are crucial to the meaning of your sentence. They cannot be removed without damaging the sense of your sentence.


Here is an example of a restrictive modifier in a sentence: “Drivers who exceed the speed limit are reckless.” This clause is essential to the meaning of the sentence and cannot be removed.
Here is another example of a restrictive modifier: “The song named “Roar"" is popular; the song named “Latte Love"" that I made up yesterday is not.’’ While these modifiers do offer additional information, they cannot be removed without obliterating the sentence’s meaning: “The song is popular; the song that I made up yesterday is not.”

, Because they are essential to the meaning of your sentence, setting off these clauses or phrases with commas will interfere with the clarity of your sentence.


In almost all cases, a clause beginning with the relative pronoun that will be restrictive and should not be set off with commas: “The car accident that I had yesterday will really raise my insurance bill.”

Use FANBOYS to help you remember the coordinating conjunctions.,
Use commas before coordinating conjunctions that link independent clauses.,
Pay attention to the grammar of the sentence.",How to Use Commas3," Coordinating conjunctions serve as connections within a sentence. The coordinating conjunctions in English are For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So., An independent clause is part of a sentence that has its own subject and verb. It can stand on its own as a sentence. You should always use a comma when a FANBOYS conjunction connects two independent clauses.


Here is an example of a FANBOYS conjunction connecting two independent clauses: “I checked out three books from the library, but now I find it impossible to read them all.” If you removed the conjunction, each clause would stand as its own sentence.
This conjunction does not connect two independent clauses: “Bai discovered he had everything he needed but a pencil.” The last part of the sentence cannot stand on its own.

, The presence of a conjunction does not necessarily require a comma. Only independent clauses need to have the comma between them.For example, if your sentence joins only two words with a conjunction, do not use a comma: “Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.”
If your sentence uses “for” as a preposition to join a dependent clause, do not use a comma: “I’m saving money for a Hawaiian vacation.”
If your sentence uses “so” to emphasize another word, do not use a comma: “The teacher was so tired of grading bad essays.”
If your sentence uses “so” in the phrase “so that,” do not use a comma: “Elena knew that she should eat her breakfast so that she would not be hungry later.”

Use a comma after most introductory adverbs.,
Use a comma after introductory words.,
Use a comma after an introductory transition.,
Use a comma after an introductory phrase more than 3 words.",How to Use Commas4," Adverbs often end with the suffix -ly and modify verbs or adjectives. Adverbs are sometimes used at the beginning of sentences to explain how something happened or felt, especially in informal writing. Common examples include generally, usually, and fortunately.For example, here is a sentence that begins with an introductory adverb: “Unsurprisingly, the one day I forgot my umbrella was the day it rained.”
Adverbs such as when and while usually introduce a restrictive modifier and should usually not be set off by commas.
Commas should be used to offset introductory adverbs that modify the entire sentence, not ones that modify a single element of the sentence (such as the verb).

, One-word introductory elements include words such as no, yes, and well, and are separated by a comma from the main clause when they begin a sentence.


Here is an example of an introductory word beginning a sentence: “No, I cannot come over this morning.”
Here is an example of well as an introductory word: “Well, I’d love a second piece of cake, but I’m on a diet.”

Why can also be used as an introductory word, but be careful: it should only be set off by a comma when it is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. The comma in the sentence “Why, that's amazing!” is correct. However, you would not use a comma in this sentence: “Why couldn’t you come over this morning?”, Introductory transitions help guide the reader from one sentence to another, and they should be set off from the sentence by a comma. Common introductory transitions include However, Furthermore, Nevertheless, and Meanwhile.Introductory transitions may also take the form of phrases, such as In addition and Despite this ___. Set them apart with commas too.

, These phrases add information to a sentence, but do not have a subject and verb that are separate from the subject and verb in the main clause of the sentence. If the introduction is less than 3 words, a comma is considered optional.Common introductory phrases include participial phrases (phrases that function as adjectives to describe something in the main clause), prepositional phrases, and infinitive phrases (beginning with infinitive verbs ).For example, this is a participial phrase: “Grasping the sword with both hands, Lancelot swung with all his might.” Grasping the sword with both hands modifies Lancelot, the subject of the main sentence.
This is an example of a prepositional phrase: “Throughout the evening, she enjoyed many pleasant conversations at the party.”
Here is an example of an infinitive phrase beginning a sentence: “To win the election, the senatorial candidate has spent more money than anyone else.”
Don't mistake gerunds (verbal nouns with -ing endings) for an introductory participial phrase. For example, you would not use a comma in this sentence: “Writing with perfect grammar is difficult but achievable.” The gerund phrase Writing with perfect grammar is the subject of the sentence.

Use a comma to separate an absolute phrase.,
Use a comma to separate an adverb clause.,
Use commas to separate things in a list or series.,
Understand the “Oxford Comma.” The Oxford comma (also known as the Harvard comma) is a comma placed before the final item in a list or series.,
Use commas between two or more adjectives of equal weight that independently modify a noun.,
Use a comma to separate dates and addresses.,
Use a comma at the salutation and close of a letter.",How to Use Commas5," An absolute phrase, also called a nominative absolute, modifies the entire sentence. While they usually come before the rest of the sentence, they may also come after the main clause. An absolute phrase usually has its own subject and is generally formed with a ""noun"" and a ""participle"" (an ""-ing"" or ""-ed"" word).


Here is an example of an absolute phrase beginning a sentence: “Her homework completed, Sujata left to meet her friends.”
Here is an example of an absolute phrase concluding a sentence: “The couple hurried home, the cold nipping at their faces.” This phrase modifies the entire main clause before it.

, Adverbial clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions, which connect the clause to the main sentence. Adverbial clauses are always dependent because of these conjunctions, and they cannot stand on their own. They may be placed at the beginning of the sentence or elsewhere.Common subordinating conjunctions include because, although, whereas, unless and since.
For example, here is an adverb clause that begins a sentence: “Because your input at the group meetings is always creative and insightful, I'm putting you in charge of the project.”
Here is an adverb clause later in a sentence: “Joe decided not to ride on the roller coaster, even though he enjoyed it, because he had just eaten a huge chili dog.”

, If you have a series of three or more items, use commas to separate each item.


For example, here is a list separated by commas: “At the store I will buy apples, oranges, pears, and bananas.”
Do not place commas before or after the list or series. This comma usage is incorrect, as shown in this example: “At the store I will buy, apples, oranges, pears, and bananas, to make fruit salad tonight.”
Do not use commas when all the items in a series are linked by and, or, or nor. For example, here is a list of items linked by and: “Kyle and Spike and Brenda and Willow all went to the concert.”
If all of the items in your series are phrases instead of single words, or if the items in your list contain commas, it is acceptable to use semicolons to separate the items instead of commas: “You have a choice of two breakfasts: granola, orange juice, and coffee, which is fairly cheap; or bacon, sausage, and eggs, which is more expensive.”, It is the topic of some debate, with some people advocating against it and others insisting that it always be used. The goal of the Oxford comma is clarity, so use it when the last two items in your series should be clearly separated.


For example, consider this sentence: “I would like to dedicate this book to my parents, my professor and John F. Kennedy.” With this punctuation, it looks as though your parents are your professor and John F. Kennedy. Using the Oxford comma will prevent this confusion: “I would like to dedicate this book to my parents, my professor, and John F. Kennedy.”
Using an Oxford comma will never be grammatically incorrect, so if you’re unsure whether you need it, use it anyway.

, Here's how to know whether the adjectives are functioning independently: If you could insert the word ""and"" between the adjectives without changing the meaning of the sentence (or producing gibberish), they are functioning independently and a comma should separate them.


For example, here is a sentence with a series of adjectives that is punctuated correctly: People who purposefully misuse grammar are brutish, irresponsible, mean-spirited troglodytes who mangle our beautiful, versatile language.

Some word pairs act as a single word (disc jockey, young man). Commas are not necessary with these.
Do not use a comma if the adjectives are joined by a conjunction!
Do not use a comma if the adjectives are of unequal weight; for example, if one of the adjectives is a color or number and the other is a quality, you would not use a comma.

For example, ""I have a big red wagon"" would not take commas, while ""I have a rusty, well-loved wagon"" would.



, Each of the elements in a date (weekday, month and day, and year) should be separated by a comma. Also use a comma to separate the elements in an address, or when referring to a city and state or country. For example, you would use a comma in this sentence: “I love to visit Tokyo, Japan.”Here is an example of correct comma usage for a date: “This WikiHow was written on Monday, May 14th, 2007, in Maryland.”
When only the month and year appear, do NOT use a comma: “I wrote this article sometime in May 2007.”
Here is an example of correct comma usage for an address: “Her new address is 1234 Main Street, Anytown, Maryland, 12345.”
When the elements of the address are joined by a preposition, no commas are needed: “It is on Highway 10 near Pensacola in Florida.”

, The salutation is the greeting at the beginning of a letter, such as ""Dear John."" The closing greeting should also be set off with a comma: ""Sincerely Yours, Hakim.""


When writing business letters, it is customary to use a colon rather than a comma: ""To Whom It May Concern: ""

Use italics for the title of a novel, a book length poem, and a story collection.,
Apply italics to the title of a magazine, a newspaper, or an encyclopedia.,
Add italics to the title of an album, a play, a film, or a television series.,
Italicize the title of a painting, a drawing, a sculpture or mixed media pieces.,
Use underlining for titles only if required by your professor.",How to Punctuate Titles2," All novels are notated with italics, such as The Old Man and the Sea or Mrs. Dalloway. Book length poems or epic poems are also notated with italics, such as Beowulf or The Odyssey. You should make sure these titles all have quotation marks, regardless of if you are citing original work in text or published works in a bibliography.Story collections and poetry collections are also notated with italics. For example, The Collected Stories of Grace Paley or The Collected Poetry of Dorothy Parker.
An anthology of essays is also italicized. For example, The Best American Essays.

, If you are citing a magazine or a newspaper, you would italicize the title. Italicize For example, Vanity Fair or The Globe and Mail. Do this for both original works in text and published works in a bibliography.The titles of encyclopedias are also italicized. For example, Encyclopedia Britannica or The Encyclopedia of Botanicals.

, If you are citing the title of a music album, you would use italics. For example, Nina Simone Live in Paris. The titles of plays and films are also italicized. For example, A Doll’s House or Raging Bull.The titles of television series or shows as a whole should be italicized. For example, Friends or The Mindy Project.

, Visual artworks, such as paintings, drawings, sculptures, and mixed media pieces, should be cited using italics. For example, Vincent Van Gogh’s Starry Night or Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure., Though underlining was once popular for titles of longer works in the past, in recent times italicizing has been used in MLA style. Some copy editors and publishers prefer titles in italics rather than underlined, as italics are thought to be more aesthetically pleasing than underlines.Check with your professor or teacher about her preference for underlying or italics before you format titles in a paper or an assignment so you do not get docked points due to formatting errors. If your professor does want you to use underlining instead of italics, follow the same steps above using underlining instead of italics."
"
Capitalize the first and last word of the title for MLA style.,
Capitalize only the first word of the title for APA style.,
Do not capitalize prepositions or articles.,
Capitalize proper nouns and names.,
Adjust the capitalization based on the length of the title.",How to Punctuate Titles3," The general rule of thumb for titles is that all “important” words should be capitalized. At the very least, the first and last words in the title should be capitalized when you are using MLA style to title your original works and works as a reference for a bibliography.You must capitalize the first and last word in the title as well as every noun, verb, adjective, and adverb. For example, the title “poem about a happy day” would appear as “Poem about a Happy Day.”
Do not use all capitals to format the title, for example, “MOBY DICK”. Instead, only capitalize the first letter of each word, for example, “Moby Dick”.

, APA style is often used for scientific writing or based on a professor’s preference. In APA style, you only capitalize the first word of the title of any books in text and in your reference list. For example, in APA style, the title would be: “The wise man on the mountain.”In APA style, you also only capitalize the first word of any subtitles in the title. For example, “The wise man on the mountain: A true story”.

, Prepositions, such as “about”, “after”, “but”,“except”, and “from” should not be capitalized in titles. You also do not need to capitalize articles, such as “a”, “an”, “and”, “the”, and “of”, in titles. This applies to MLA and APA style.For example, the title “wise man on the mountain” would appear as: “Wise Man on the Mountain.”
The exception to this rule is if the title begins with a preposition or article. The preposition or article would be capitalized in this case. For example, the title “the sound and the fury” would appear as: “The Sound and the Fury.”, A proper noun is a noun that names a specific item, rather than a common item. For example, “cookie” is a noun, while “Oreo” is a proper noun. You should capitalize proper nouns in all titles, regardless of if you are using MLA or APA style.You should also make sure you capitalize any names of persons or key historical events in a title. This could be a well known cultural or political figure, or the name of a historical event.
For example, the title “The ramifications of Mao Zedong’s cultural revolution” would appear as: “The Ramifications of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution”.

, Sometimes, in shorter titles, all of the words are capitalized. For example, “Losing My Religion” or “Why Not Me?” In titles that are longer than five words, you may capitalize only the first and last words.When in doubt, more capitalization is better than too little capitalization. You can also look up the title if it already exists in print and check to see how the author or publisher capitalizes the title.

Make sure you know what words will be in the spelling bee.,
Start studying all of those words!,
Study without a guide.,
Focus on the toughies.,
Increase your vocab.,
Play word games.,
Try other ways to build up your vocab.,
Go the extra mile.,
Relax!,
Be confident during the bee.",How to Win a Spelling Bee," The first thing you will need to do is to get the list of words that will be used in your spelling bee. If you aren't sure if your spelling bee has a study list, ask the adults or teachers running your spelling bee if there is a study guide.;
, The first thing you need to do after you receive your study guide, is to read every word aloud. Just doing this will briefly familiarize you with all of the words on the list. It is quite likely you will run into a word you do not know how to pronounce. When this happens, look it up on an online dictionary site (Merriam-Webster is a solid choice) that offers voice pronunciation. Now once you have learned how to say every word, go through the list once more and say each word aloud with confidence.

, If your spelling bee doesn't have a study guide, try asking the adults or teachers who are running the spelling bee how they would recommend studying. If they say read a certain book, totally do that. Whatever the teachers say, is the best way of studying if your spelling bee doesn't have a study guide.

, After you have read though each word twice, you should probably already know what words you already know, and which ones you need to totally learn.


Pick the top 10-20 hardest words and write them down on a piece of paper or a flashcard. Now, fold it up and put it in your pocket. Throughout the rest of your day, whenever you have the extra 5 minutes to study, take out the flashcard and look at the word, say the word, close your eyes, spell the word, and check it. You can also try writing down the word somewhere else and check it after

, In most spelling bees, after all of the words from the study guide have been spelled, and there are still two or more people in the bee, usually, the bee changes to any word from a specific dictionary. It would be quite handy to borrow or buy a copy of that dictionary. But even if you can't get that dictionary, there are still more ways you can prepare for the menacing final rounds.

, If you aren't exactly a word nerd, ""word games"" might sound yawn-inducing. However, if you really want to win a spelling bee, you already have the interest in words so you should definitely give them a try. You can play Scrabble with your friends, or download Words with Friends on your phone. You can play crosswords in your newspaper, or play some vocabulary quizzes online.

, A really great way to build up your vocab is to sign up for a ""word of the day"" E-mail list. Merriam Webster and Dictionary dot com offer this service. Reading sentences with tricky words is another good way to study. You effortlessly build up your vocabulary while having fun!

, If during the spelling bee you aren't allowed to ask for the language of origin, you can skip this step. However if you are allowed, keep reading! To go the extra mile to be extremely prepared for a word you even don't know, learn Greek and Latin roots.


If you aren't sure what that means, look at the words ""telephone"", ""headphone"" and ""homophone"". All have the mini word ""phone"" in them. The mini word ""phone"" comes from the Greek word ""phonos"" meaning sound. The word ""tele"" comes from well, the Greek word ""tele"" meaning ""over a distance"". So, the word telephone sort of means ""sound over a distance"". Since the words ""headphone"" and ""homophone"" both contain the mini word ""phone"", even if we don't know what the two words mean, we can take a good guess that it has something to do with sound. And they do, headphone(s) give well, head sound, and a homophone is when a word has 2 pronunciations. Homo is another mini word. Homo comes from the Greek word ""homos"" meaning ""the same"". You might recognize the mini word ""homo"" is words like homograph, homosexual, and homogeneous. All of which have something to do with something being the same. So far we have been calling these, ""mini words"". They are actually called roots.
There are plenty of Greek and Latin roots to learn. Some interesting ones being aqua- meaning water, and myrmec- meaning ant. Here is an example of when knowing Greek and Latin roots would come in handy. Let's say you get a word pronounced ""mer-muh-kaw-lo-gee"". You ask for the definition and the judge says ""The scientific study of ants"". Since you just learned that myrmec- means ant, that would give you a pretty good hint as to how to spell it. You also know that some words end in -ology when it's the study of something. You guess myrmecology, and you are right! All you need to do to start learning, is to do a Google search of ""Greek and Latin roots"". There is a difference between memorizing a word, and understanding a word.

, Don't forget to take breaks. If it is a big spelling bee with a big cash prize, it may seem like a bad idea to take breaks but studying too hard for too long will lead to stress, and fatigue (especially if it is taking away from your sleep time)

, It's game time, baby! All of your hard work has come down to this. Almost every first time speller will be nervous. Most people will tell you to not be nervous, but it isn't just that simple. Take deep breaths, and walk up to the microphone with confidence. Take your time with the word. It isn't a race.

Use stationary when you are referring to something being stopped.,
Use stationery when you want to enjoy your paper, letter writing and pen supplies.,
Avoid confusing the two.",How to Tell the Difference Between Stationary and Stationery," For example:


The economy is bad, interest rates are stationary.
The bus was stationary at the bus stop.
""Nary a move!"" (nary means ""not ever""/""never any"") so that object is statioNARY!;
, For example:


I collect beautiful stationery sets to write snail mail to my great Aunts.
I bought my paper at the stationery shop.

, These terms are commonly confused but there is a fun and simple trick to stop you doing the same. Whenever you mean the paper or writing supplies, think about the word ""paper"". It ends in ""ER"". The ""stationERy"" that you want to use is spelled in the latter part with an ""er"", not an ""ar"" -- just as paper ends with an ""er"", not an ""ar"". Think this and you'll be set!


As an alternative or supplement to the above, if something is ""statioNARy"" it is:

Use the informal phrase ""a lot"" when you wish to describe quantity.,
Understand that ""a lot"" is often considered slang.,
Use ""allot"" when you are referring to giving out, apportioning, dividing or granting something.,
Refrain from using ""alot"".,
Practice your usage.","How to Tell the Difference Between Alot, Allot and A Lot"," ""A lot"" is a noun phrase (an indefinite article a + a noun) that functions as an adjective to refer to the quantity of something.This makes it like any other noun phrase, such as ""a wagon"" or ""a puppy,"" and it is always spelled as two words. For example:


I have a lot of money.
I have a lot of burritos.
I have a lot of Bratz dolls.
I like you a lot.;
, ""A lot"" is often used in informal conversation to describe the quantity of something, but it is usually considered too colloquial for use in formal prose.


Some people prefer to use a lot to describe quantities for collective nouns, or things that cannot be counted individually, such as sugar or water. For example: ""There was a lot of sugar on the floor."" It may be preferable to use other words, such as ""several,"" ""many,"" or ""a great deal of"" when referring to count nouns (things that can be counted individually)., Allot is a verb, something you do, rather than an adjective that describes something. For example:


He was allotted three feet of space to set up his art stall.
I will allot these lottery tickets to my friends.

, It no longer exists as an acceptable word in English. It was taught in the U.S. school systems in the 60's through the 90's which may be causing some confusion between generations.

, If you catch yourself writing alot, even in informal situations, rewrite it as a lot"" as it is the accepted appropriate use.

Understand when it is appropriate to use a contraction.,
Use an apostrophe to make a contraction.,

Familiarize yourself with positive contractions.,
Keep in mind the double meanings of some positive contractions.,
Identify negative contractions.,
Understand the double use of some negative contractions.,
Apply only one contraction in a sentence.,
Use informal contractions in casual conversation only.,
Apply contractions to a sentence.,
Distinguish between the use of “it’s” and “its” in a sentence.,
Use contractions in a paragraph.",How to Use Contractions," From a technical standpoint, contractions are not necessary in written English. The grammatically correct way to write requires the full version of every word. Contracting, or shortening words, should only be done for stylistic purposes and for specific types of writing.If you are writing something where you are “talking” directly to your reader, you may use contractions. Writing a casual email or letter to a friend or someone you know well on a personal level would be an appropriate time to use contractions to keep your language from sounding stuffy or too formal. Contractions often create a friendly and casual tone when used in writing.
If you are writing dialogue in a play or a novel, you may use contractions to show how a certain character speaks to other characters. This also extends to assignments for school where you are creating a scene from a play or writing a short story.
If you are creating a slogan or an advertisement, you may use contractions to keep the phrase short and to the point.
Avoid using contractions in formal documents like cover letters, medical documents, or legal documents. The only time you will use contractions in an academic essay is when you are quoting sources that use contractions. Some teachers and professors may be less rigid on the “no contractions” in an essay rule. Talk to your teacher about this before you hand in an essay full of contractions.;
, When you create a contraction, you are taking two words and putting them together. You then insert an apostrophe to replace certain letters in the two words.For example: “he is” is contracted to: “he’s”. “They are” is contracted to: “they’re”.
You use contractions in a sentence to shorten the phrase and give it a less formal tone. For example: “They are playing together.” When you use a contraction, you combine “they” and “are” together. You then replace the “a” with an apostrophe. The sentence becomes: “They’re playing together.”
You can also use contractions in questions. For example, “Where did they go?” When you use a contraction, you combine “where” and “did” together. You then replace the “i” with an apostrophe. “Where’d they go?”

, One of the most misused contractions is the contraction “it’s”. “It’s” is the contracted form of “it is” or “it has”. It is never the possessive form of “it”. Use the context of the sentence to determine if you need to use an apostrophe or no apostrophe for “it”.For example: “It’s late.” You use an apostrophe because this is the contracted form of “it is”. “It’s been a lovely evening”. This is the contracted form of “it has”.
But a sentence like: “The cat licked its tongue” does not require an apostrophe for “its” because the “its” is possessive in the sentence. “It” refers to “the cat” and is possessive, so it does not require an apostrophe. “The cat licked it’s tongue” would mean “The cat licked it is tongue” or “The cat licked it has tongue” and this is clearly incorrect.

, Positive contractions are used often in common speech and in casual writing. They are often used when a pronoun, such as “I” is next to a verb, such as “is”. The most common positive contractions include:“I’m”: contracted form of “I am”
“I’ve”: contracted form of “I have”
“I’ll”: contracted form of “I will”
“I’d”: contracted form of “I would/ I should/ I had”
“You’re”: contracted form of “you are”
“You’ll”: contracted form of “you will”
“You’d”: contracted form of “you had/ you would”
“He’s”: contracted form of “he has/ he is”
“He’ll”: contracted form of “he will”
“He’d”: contracted form of “he had/he would”
“She’s”: contracted form of “she has/she is”
“She’ll”: contracted form of “she will”
“She’d”: contracted form of “she had/she would”
“It’s”: contracted form of “it has/it is”
“It’ll”: contracted form of “it will”
“We’re: contracted form of “we are”
“We’ve”: contracted form of “we have”
“We’ll”: contracted form of “we will”
“We’d”: contracted form of “we had/ we would”
“They’re”: contracted form of “they are”
“They’ve”: contracted form of “they have”
“They’ll”: contracted form of “they will”
“They’d”: contracted form of “they had/they would”

, Some contractions, such as “he’d” could be the contracted form of either “he would” or “he had”. The context of the sentence will help you determine which meaning is implicated by the contraction. Always read the entire sentence to figure out what contraction is being used.For example: “She’d like to go to the store.” This is the contraction of “She would like to go to the store” as it is the only grammatically correct option. “She had like to go to the store” is clearly incorrect.
“She’d completed the work by the time I arrived.” This is the contraction of “She had finished the work by the time I arrived” as it is the only grammatically correct option. “She would finished the work…” is clearly incorrect.
As well, the contraction “‘s”, the contracted form of “is” or “has” can be used with pronouns and it can be used with nouns, names, question words, and words like “here” and “there”. For example: “The plane’s late.” “Joan’s left.” “What’s the score?” “There’s the dog.” “Here’s your receipt.”

, Negative contractions are when you take a verb, such as “are” and combine it with “not”. The apostrophe is then used to replace the “o” in “not” so it becomes “n’t”. Examples of negative contractions are:“Aren’t”: contracted form of “are not”
“Can’t”: contracted form of “cannot”
“Couldn’t”: contracted form of “could not”
“Daren’t”: contracted form of “dare not”
“Didn’t”: contracted form of “did not”
“Doesn’t”: contracted form of “does not”
“Don’t”: contracted form of “do not”
“Hasn’t”: contracted form of “has not”
“Haven’t”: contracted form of “have not”
“Hadn’t”: contracted form of “had not”
“Isn’t”: contracted form of “is not”
“Shouldn’t”: contracted form of “should not”
“Wasn’t”: contracted form of “was not”
“Weren’t”: contracted form of “were not”
“Won’t”: contracted form of “will not”
“Wouldn’t”: contracted form of “would not”
Other negative contractions like “mayn’t” (contracted form of “may not”), “mustn’t” (contracted form of “must not”) and “needn’t” (contracted form of “need not”) are considered outdated contractions. They are not used in common speech and are often not used in written language.

, When you are using the verb “to be” in a sentence and you are trying to create the negative form, there are two possible options. For example: “we are not” could be contracted to “we aren’t” or “we’re not”. “She is not” can be contracted to “she isn’t” or “she’s not”. “They are not” can be contracted to “they aren’t” or “they’re not”.The exception is “I am not.” It can only be contracted to “I’m not”. Do not contract “I am not” to “I’m n’t” or “I am n’t”. In English, the contractions “‘s” and “‘re” usually appear after pronouns. For example: “We aren’t ready yet.” “He’s not a good man.”
You may put a contraction at the end of a question, such as: “You’ve spoken to Mark, haven’t you?” But if you are putting “am not” at the end of the question, it should be contracted to “aren’t”. For example: “I’m early, aren’t I?”

, It is grammatically incorrect to put more than one contraction in a sentence that is not a question. For example: “He’s not here”, instead of “He’s n’t free”.Keep in mind positive contractions should appear in the middle or the beginning of the sentence, never at the end of a sentence. For example: “I think we’re lost.” “Yes, I think we are.” You would not write, “Yes, I think we’re”.

, Informal contractions like “gonna” (contracted form of “going to”), “wanna” (contracted form of “want to”) and “gimme” (contracted form of “give me”) are not appropriate for formal or informal writing, and should be restricted to casual conversation only. The exception is if you are writing dialogue in a novel, play, or other work of fiction where characters use informal contractions when they are speaking to each other. Informal contractions are not considered proper English and are often frowned upon even in casual speech.Other informal contractions include “whatcha” (contracted form of “what are you”), “ain’t” (contracted form of “am not”) and “gotta” (contracted form of “got to”).

, Choose one to two sentences from a book or a piece of writing that do not contain contractions. Adjust the sentences so they have properly contracted words.


For example: “I am going to the store to buy some eggs. We are having omelets for breakfast.” If you adjust the sentences to have contractions: “I’m going to the store to buy some eggs. We’re having omelets for breakfast.”
Another example might use positive and negative contractions. For example: “You did not go to the store in time. I am making pancakes instead.” The sentence with contractions would be: “You didn’t go to the store in time. I’m making pancakes instead.”

, Tackle one of the most common mistakes in written English by testing your ability to use “it’s” and “its” properly in a sentence.


For example: “It is time to party.” The sentence with the contraction would be: “It’s time to party” as “it’s” is the contracted version of “it is”. “The horse lifted its head.” This sentence does not need an apostrophe was the “it” is possessive and not a contraction.

, Amp up your ability to use contractions correctly by making a list of things you are going to do during your school day. Use “I” or “he” or “she” to describe each action you are going to do today. Don’t use any contractions in your paragraph about your day. Then, read it over and adjust it so it has contractions.


For example: “I am going to wake up and brush my teeth. Then, I will get dressed and curl my hair. My mom is not going to be happy because I am late for the bus. She will tell me not to eat breakfast and to run for the bus instead. On my walk to school, I will see my friend Lola. Lola is one of my best friends at school.”
If you adjust this paragraph so it has contractions: “I’m going to wake up and brush my teeth. Then, I’ll get dressed and curl my hair. My mom isn’t going to be happy because I’m late for the bus. She’ll tell me not to eat breakfast and to run for the bus instead. On my walk to school, I’ll see my friend Lola. Lola’s one of my best friends at school.”

Consider the word's context and meaning.,
Ask yourself whether the word can be put into other tenses.,
Check to see if the word is being used to negate something.,
Modify other words by using no as a determiner.,
Express strong emotions using the word no.,
Provide more information about a verb, adjective, or phrase by using no as an adverb.,
Refer to a negative verbal response in shorthand by employing no as a noun.,
Practice identifying the correct spelling of the words no and know.,
Identify the correct spelling of know and no in the following sentences.,
Try these sample sentences, completing each sentence with either k-n-o-w or n-o.,
Check your understanding of the difference between know and no.,
Write 5 sentences using the word no, and then write 5 sentences using the word know.,
Ask a friend or family member to read your sentences.",How to Understand the Difference Between Know and No," Ask yourself: Is this word a verb? K-n-o-w is always a verb. A person can k-n-o-w something or someone, but they can't n-o anything.To know means:


To be aware of: I know something is going to happen.
To have knowledge of: I know it's Suzy's birthday.
To be sure or certain about something: I know that there is a cake in the kitchen.
To be familiar or acquainted with: Do Diane and Yao know Suzy?
To recognize: Diane didn't know Suzy's voice, but she heard someone coming.;
, The word know, as a verb, may be conjugated into the forms knew, known, or knowing. If the word can't be put into other tenses, it might be n-o.



Knew is the past tense, for things that have already happened: Diane knew something was not right.

Known uses ""helping"" or ""auxiliary"" verbs, such as have or do, to show shades of time in the past, or to show a hypothetical: If he had checked his watch, Yao might have known that he was late.Knowing is the gerund form, which means it can act as a subject: ""Knowing that grammar sure helped me do better on my test.""If the word is not a verb, the correct spelling might be n-o.

, No can be used as a determiner, an exclamation, an adverb or a noun, but it almost always is used to convey negative information, or to negate another word in the sentence., When no is used to modify a noun, it generally serves to negate or alter the noun in a negative manner.No can mean not any (or hardly any): No two people can come to complete agreement.
The opposite of: She is no genius.

Rules forbidding particular actions or behaviors: No smoking within 50 yards of the entrance.

, Used as an exclamation, no is an expression of strong emotion. It can be used within a larger sentence, or as a stand-alone response.A negative response to a direct question: ""Do these jeans make me look fat?"" ""No.""

An agreement with a negative statement: ""She'd never attend a friend's birthday party, oh, no.""

An expression of dismay or disappointment: ""Oh, no! I spilled my drink!""

, The word no is used here to negatively modify other words.


""She was no more able to rouse herself than a cabbage.""
""I asked Jackson what he'd seen, but he was no help at all.""

, Though this may refer to one person's response, it's frequently used in the collective.


A negative decision: ""The bond issue was decided with a resounding no.""
A negative response: ""That would be a no, then?""

, Both words are commonly used. You will easily find them in popular print or online. A great way to learn the difference between no and know is to practice recognizing the correct (or incorrect) spelling in other people's writing. Because the word sounds exactly alike, reading aloud won't help!

, This practice is an important step in learning to use the correct spelling for yourself. Remember to double-check your answers by referring to the definition of each word.


I found know relief. I found no relief.
""Do you want more cake?"" ""No, thank you."" ""Know, thank you.""
Suzy and Bob wanted know more of it. Suzy and Bob wanted no more of it.
For a while, there was no noise. For a while, there was know noise.

,


She didn't ____ how she would succeed.
Frank left us with __ choice.
There's __ business like show business!
I ____ you from someplace, don't I?

, The best way to know that you've learned to understand the difference between know and no is to use them in your own writing. Start by reviewing the two words' meanings. Remember, if the word is a verb, it is know. If not, it is probably no.

, These sentences can be short or long.You can use the sentences above as examples to follow, or you can write examples from your own life. You might recall something you've heard or said that includes the word no or know. It's a word most of us use quite often!


Carefully proofread the sentences you have written. Do your sentences make sense, given what you know now about the words no and know?
Ask yourself: could another verb (such as understand, comprehend, or recognize) be substituted for my word no/know in this sentence? If the answer is yes, you probably want to use the word k-n-o-w. If the answer is no, then your answer is n-o.

, Do they understand what you mean to say? If they know what you mean, you've achieved your goal!

Use subtlety as a noun.,
Practice.","How to Tell the Difference Between Subtle, Subtly and Subtlety"," The word ""subtle"" describes a noun that is difficult to notice or understand. Here are a few example sentences:


The dresses are all wonderful, but their colours have subtle differences between them.
My mother's warning glance was a subtle hint that I should change the topic.
The painting looks drab at first, but there is a subtle beauty in the pattern of brushstrokes.
Memory aid:
Remember that ""subtle"" is the adjective by recalling that ""subtle"" and ""adjective"" both end in e.
;
, An adverb typically modifies a verb or adjective. If something happens ""subtly,"" the action the verb refers to may be difficult to notice, or require skill to interpret. An adjective modified by ""subtly"" refers to a quality that is restrained, toned down, or hard to notice.


I began clearing dishes off the table, subtly informing my guests that it was time to leave.
We were just going out to buy groceries, but the clear sky and bright stars made the walk subtly romantic.
Memory aid:
""-ly"" is a common way to turn an adjective into an adverb. It's also common to drop the final ""e"" from adjectives that end in -ble: think of ""invisibly"" or ""fashionably"".


, Subtlety is the state of being subtle. Use it in phrases like ""with subtlety,"" ""demonstrate subtlety,"" or anywhere else a noun is required.


My loud, energetic English teacher is not exactly known for her subtlety.
We had to write with great subtlety to get past the censors, hiding our true meaning inside references and wordplay.
Memory aid:
""-ty"" is a suffix that turns some adjectives into nouns. Think of ""agility"" or ""safety"".


, Practice writing the words out in different sentences, especially to make sure that you get the spellings correct. If you're not sure you've used one of these words correctly, identify the part of speech:


Does the word describe a noun in the sentence? Then use the adjective, subtle.
Does the word modify an adjective or verb? Then use the adverb, subtly.
Is it impossible to remove the word without getting an incomplete sentence? Then use the noun, subtlety.

Look up tough words.,
Practice.,
Don't study too many words at once.,
Review your words.,
Say your words out loud.,
Use the words you are studying.",How to Study for a Spelling Test1," If you don't know how to spell a difficult word, take a few moments and look it up. Spelling a word wrong will only reinforce the incorrect spelling. It's important that you practice spelling your words with the correct spelling. This will help you remember how to spell the word the right way and pass your spelling test., The simplest way to prepare for your spelling test is to get in regular practice. If you aren't using and spelling the words you need to study, you may begin to forget exactly how to spell them. By regularly studying, using, and spelling the words on the test, you can make recalling the correct spelling much easier.Try to practice your spelling words at least once a day.
Using your study words on other projects can be a good way to get in extra practice.
Don't leave practicing your words until the last minute. Always avoid cramming before your spelling tests.

, Although you may have a long list of words that you need to study, overdoing it can actually cause problems. It's much easier for you to study a smaller section of your word list and retain that information, than it is to study all the words at once. If you have a lot of words to study, try breaking them down into smaller groups to make them easier to manage and remember., Even if you feel that you've gotten in some good practice and that you know how to spell at word, taking some time to review them can be a good idea. Reviewing the word after practice and study can help show you just how well you actually remember the spelling. A good review session can also count as extra practice and will help you do your best on the spelling test., It can be helpful to say any words you are studying out-loud. This can help give you a sound to associate with the spelling of the word. You should try to say the word, the sounds, and the letters aloud whenever you are practicing the spelling of a word. If you are unsure of how to say a word, ask someone to read it out to you.Imagine you are studying the word “cough”. Try to say the word out loud as it is normally pronounced when you are learning to spell it.
It can help to stretch the word out. Try saying something like “cawwwfff” while writing it the word “cough” down.

, Beyond getting in regular practice, using the words in everyday writing or speaking can be helpful. Try to write sentences using the words on your study list or working them into conversations. The more exposure you have to these new words, the more likely you will be to remember them during the test. You'll also be able to build a bigger vocabulary that you can put to use after your test.Try to think of some different phrases that you can use to help you recall the spelling of a word.
Knowing the meaning of the words can help you recall how they are spelled.

Know that odds tell you the likelihood of an outcome.,
Read sporting odds as the likelihood that one team, athlete, or horse, will win.,
Remember that lower odds return a higher profit.,
Learn the vocabulary of odds when betting.,
Know that odds at the track tell you amount of profit you will make per dollar spent.,
Understand that fractions greater than one mean a team is an underdog.,
Know that moneyline bets only concern what team will win the game.,
Know that positive odds indicate how much profit you win per $100 spent.,
Understand that negative odds indicate how much money your must spend to make $100.,
Notice that point spreads adjust the score for the favorite team.,
Ask your bookie about the ""vig,"" which determines your potential profit.,
Know that Over/Under bets are placed on the combined score of both teams and are much simpler to place.,
Most payouts for Over/Under bets are even, meaning that if you wager $100 you win $100 profit.",How to Read Odds," Odds represent which team, horse, or athlete has the highest probability of winning. While there are different ways to write odds, they all indicate how likely one outcome is in comparison to another.


Ex. When I flip a coin, it is just as likely that I flip heads as tails. The odds are equal, or one to one.

Ex. If there is an 80% chance of rain one day, then there is a 20% chance it will not rain as well. The odds are 80 to 20. Otherwise put, it is four times more likely that it will rain than stay sunny.
Because circumstances may change spontaneously, odds may change as well. They are not an exact science.;
, The most common use of odds is found when placing a bet on a sporting event. Betting agencies use historical data and team statistics to predict who is more likely to win.


Whoever has the highest odds is considered the ""favorite."" If the odds are low, it means that event is not likely to occur.

, Betting on the underdog is riskier than betting on a favorite, but a higher risk means a higher potential reward.


The ""longer the odds,"" or the less likely, the more money you could win.

, Many racetracks and betting establishments will have a booklet or pamphlet helping you learn terminology, but you should understand the lingo before you read odds. Some of the basic words include:



Action: A bet or wager of any kind or amount.

Bookie: Someone who accepts bets and sets odds.

Chalk: The favorite.

Hedging: Placing bets on the team with the high odds, and the low odds, to minimize loss.

Line: On any event, the current odds or point spreads on the game.

Wager: The money you pay, or risk, on an outcome or event.

, Odds of 3-5 indicate that your profit will be three-fifths of a dollar. In other words, for every $5 you bet you can win $3 in profit.


To determine profit, multiply the amount you bet by the fraction. If I spend $15, then my profit for winning is $9 (15 x 3/5).
Ex. If I successfully bet $15 on a horse with 3/5 odds of winning, the payout would be $24 ($15 + )

, This makes sense, because you would expect a bet on the underdog to have a higher payout.


If you have a hard time with fractions, then see if there is a larger number on top then on bottom. If so, that team/horse is not expected to win.
When you bet for the underdog, it is called betting ""against the odds."" For example, if odds are 3/1 for the Cowboys this Sunday, then it is three times more likely that they will lose than win.
Odds of 3-1 indicate that if you bet $100, you will win $400, the original amount of your bet plus the profit. Odds of 1-3 will win you $33 on a $100 bet, or $133.

, Odds are presented as a positive or negative number next to the team's name. A negative number means the team is favored to win, while a positive number indicates that they are the underdog.


Ex. Dallas Cowboys, -135; Seattle Seahawks, +135. This means the Cowboys are the favorites, but pay out less money if a bet on them wins.
Try out an online to check your math when you first get started. Soon enough it will be second nature, but for now ask a friend or search for a calculator that fits your betting needs.

, You also get the money you bet back. So when you bet $100 on the Seahawks, who are valued at +135, then you make $235 if they win.


If you bet $200, you will make twice as much profit. To calculate how much profit you make per dollar spent, divide the amount you are going to spend by 100.
Multiply this number by the moneyline to see your potential profit. If I spend $50, I will make .5 (50/100) of the moneyline if I win. On +135 odds, I would make $67.50 profit off of a winning bet.
Ex. If I spend $250 on the Cowboys (+135), I would earn $587.50 ($250 + $135 x ) if they win.

, When betting on the favorite, you take less risk, and thus earn less. When betting on a favorite, the moneyline is the amount of money you need to spend to make $100 profit. In the previous example, in order to make $100 of profit betting for the Cowboys, you would need to spend $135. Like positive odds, you earn back your bet when winning.


To calculate profit, divide 100 by the moneyline to find out the profit made per dollar spent. If the moneyline is -150, then you will make $.66 dollars for every dollar you bet (100/150).
Ex. If the Giants are favored to win -150, and I spend $90, I would make $150 total ($90 + $90 x ).

, This is easiest to see with an example: If NY is playing Boston, and Boston is favored to win by an 4-point spread, then a bet on Boston only pays out if Boston wins by more than 4 points. A bet on NY pays out if NY wins or if they lose by less than 4 points.


If the favorite wins by the spread exactly, it is called a ""push"" and all bets are refunded. In the example, if Boston wins 88-84, then it is a push and no one collects a profit.
If you see ""half-odds"" (a 4.5-point spread, for example), this is to make a ""push"" impossible. When the spread is small, moneyline bets are often better since the spread does not indicate a clear underdog. , Also known as the ""juice,"" the vigorish is the commission charged for placing a bet. Typically the vig is -110, and you read this number like a moneyline bet (see above).


On a vig of -110, I must bet $110 to make a $100 profit.
Continuing the example above, say I placed $110 on Boston, and they win 96-90 on a 4-point spread. Because they won by the spread, I would make $210 ($110 + $100).
Sometimes there are different vigs for each team. A line from before might look like this: Boston -6, -125; NY +6, -110. This means you have to bet $125 on Boston to earn $100 because there is less risk betting on Boston. , A bookie sets the Over/Under, and you simply choose if the combined score will be higher or lower than that mark. Over/Under bets are often less risky and complicated than other forms of betting.


If the O/U is 198.5 points and you bet over, then any combined score from 199 points and up will pay out.
If the score is exactly what the bookies set, then the bet is a push and everyone gets their money back.

,


Make sure to check this with your bookie first, however.

Say each letter out-loud as you write the word to help build familiarity with its spelling. Make sure the word is spelled correctly before moving on., Move down a few lines on your paper and write the word again. Make sure you say the entire word out-loud before writing it, speaking out each letter as well. However, you will not write the last letter of the word down for this step. Even though you are not writing the last letter down, you should still say it out loud., Keep moving down to the next line and writing one less letter every time you spell the word. You should still be saying the entire word and each letter aloud, even though you aren't spelling the entire thing. Continue removing letters until you only have the first letter of the word remaining., Fold your paper in half, hiding the original spelling of the word. Start rebuilding the word by saying the whole word and every letter aloud. Write only the first and last letters of the word. Move to a new section on the paper. Say the word and spell it out, adding in the two final letters of it. Continue in this way until you have completely spelled the word out again.For example, you would start by writing the word “tower” as 't___r”. You would then write “t__er”. Add another letter to get “t_wer”. Finish the word by writing “tower”.

For example, the word ""weird"" could be remembered by assigning a word to each letter. ""Would everyone inside read documents?"" could be the saying you use to remember how to spell the word ""weird"".
Try including difficult areas of a word in your mnemonic. For example, Sep""arat""e is ""a rat of a word to spell"" could help you remember the tricky middle section of the word separate.

, The English language is made up of words that were borrowed from many other language families. Because of this, many of the words in English can be difficult to spell. However, learning the language of origin for a word can give you some hints when you are remembering how to spell it. Take a look at some of these examples to get a better idea of how learning the origins of words can help you spell them:Many English words come from Latin. In words with a Latin origin, most ""K"" sounds are spelled with the letter C. Many ""S"" sounds will be spelled with an ""SC"" combination.
Words with Greek origins may spell the short I sound with the letter Y. For example, in the word ""symbiotic"", the ""y"" has the sound of a short i.

See if the envelope provides information about recycling.,
Check with your local government.,
Contact the manufacturer.,
Check with the post office.",How to Recycle Padded Envelopes1," Many padded envelopes may actually provide information about proper recycling guidelines. Scan the envelope for recycling information. If you find information on the envelope itself, this is probably the easiest way to figure out where to take the envelope for recycling.;
, Different communities may have different recycling rules when it comes to padded envelopes, and the rules often hinge on what the envelope's material composition. Check with your local city, village or town hall about the rules in your area.Generally speaking, padded envelopes that are entirely constructed of paper are usually recyclable. The envelopes that contain material that looks like dryer lint are recyclable in many communities.
However, paper envelopes that contain mixed materials, such as paper and plastic (like bubble wrap) may not be recyclable unless you are able to separate the plastic from the paper, and discard them separately (the paper in your bin and the plastic at a special recycling center in your community). In Seattle, for example, padded envelopes are generally non-recyclable. Check with your local government about regulations, especially if you have padded envelopes with bubble wrap inside.

, Different padded envelopes will require different recycling approaches. Check with the manufacturer. Some manufacturers' websites offer suggestions for recycling of padded envelopes, and some manufacturers have well developed recycling programs.


Some communities will not accept certain padded envelopes, such as those heavily coated with plastic film, for recycling at all. They also do not recommend that you compost them. Some manufacturers have set up custom programs that work with local recyclers in your region instead.For example, Tyvek industrial packaging contains high-density polyethylene. However, the manufacturer has set up a network of recyclers to take back the items. Contact the manufacturer directly.
Sometimes plastic coating on envelopes can be mechanically recycled into other products, such as cable protection piping, automotive parts, and blown film., The United States Postal Service has a recycling program so strong that it reported recycling 220,000 tons of envelopes, wastepaper, and other materials in one recent year alone. It’s possible the post office will take your padded envelope.The post office buys and uses some recycled materials and also provides recyclable mailers for purchase at some locations.
Many packaging stores (like UPS) may also accept padded envelopes. Check with the local office to find out for sure.If your local post office won't accept the materials, the post office may still be able to recommend other recycling locations.

Consider the definition of “definitely,” and think about other words with similar meanings spelled in a similar manner with two instances of the letter “i.” Words similar to “definitely” in meaning and spelling are:

Finite
Infinite
Infinity
Definite;
,
Add “ly” to the end of “definite” without changing the spelling.,
Use the trick of separating the syllables in “definitely” and giving each syllable a different meaning to remember its spelling.",How to Spell “Definitely”,", The word “definite” is an adjective, and can be changed into the adverb “definitely” simply by adding an “ly” to the end. The spelling and letters should not be changed or edited in any way., The word can be separated into “De-fin-it-Ely” to mean that a person named “Ely” is going to “de-fin” an object, such as a fish. Here are the meanings for each syllable:

De-fin: To cut off a tail.
It: (Referring to the subject.)
Ely: A person’s name.
Say the word out loud to put it all together for the correct spelling: De-fin-it-ely.

Use ""canceled"" in American English.,
Use ""cancelled"" in British English.,
Don't worry too much.,
Learn about the origin of the change.,
Follow the same guideline for ""cancelling."",
Apply the same principle to similar words.,
Understand when American English doubles the L. Within American English, you should double the ending L of a multiple syllable word if the stress does not fall on the first syllable.,
Know when British English drops one L. If the second-to-last syllable of a multiple syllable word ends with more than one L, you should not double the final L even if using British English.",How to Spell Cancelled," Most professional and personal literature produced within the United States only spells the word with one l: canceled.


Note that Associated Press (AP) style guidelines formally recommend the American English spelling, so if you're wondering how to spell the word in an academic essay for a U.S. school or university, or wishing to use it in a professional article, it's best to use ""canceled."";
, If you're reading something from the United Kingdom, you'll probably see that the writer doubled the l: cancelled.


Similarly, other forms of English that adhere more closely to the original British English, like Australian English and Canadian English, also use this version of the word., While each version of English has its own preference, you'll likely see both ""canceled"" and ""cancelled"" used interchangeably throughout the English-speaking world.


It's a good idea to memorize the difference for academic and professional writing purposes, but for everyday usage, either spelling works.
The swap is especially common in the United States. While ""cancelled"" is the preferred spelling by a wide margin in British English, ""canceled"" beats out ""cancelled"" by a much smaller margin in American English.In fact, there is roughly one double-L spelling for every five single-L spellings when analyzing literature written within the United States. Outside of the United States, however, the single-L spelling rarely occurs., When the American lexicographer Noah Webster created his 1898 dictionary, he dropped the double-L on ""cancelled"" and several other terms. That was likely when American English first adopted ""canceled"" as the proper form.


When Webster made his change to “canceled,” he also dropped letters from various other British spellings. That's why you'll see words like ""color"" and ""humor"" written with only an ""o"" in American English, even though they're written as ""colour"" and ""humour"" in British English.That being said, most American literature still used the double-L ""cancelled"" for several decades. The literary switch to ""canceled"" began taking hold in the 1940s and only gained dominance in the 1980s., Like ""cancelled,"" ""cancelling"" should be spelled with a double-L when using British English and a single-L when using American English.You should apply the same rule for canceller/canceler and cancellable/cancelable.
Note, however, that this rule does not apply to cancellation, which is always spelled with the double-L, or to cancel and cancels, which are always spelled with only a single-L.

, As a general rule, this principle applies to any word with multiple syllables when that word ends with L.This means that, when using British English, you should double the ending L of such words any time you add suffixes like -ed, -ing, -ist, -ize, and -ise.

In most instances, however, you would keep the single-L spelling for American English.
Examples of other words following this rule include: level (leveled/levelled), quarrel (quarreled/quarrelled), and travel (traveled/travelled).

,


For example: control (controlled), patrol (patrolled), and annul (annulled)
Note that British English maintains the double-L spelling for these words, as well.

,


The only relevant example is the word ""parallel"" (paralleled).
American English also refrains from adding another L to the end of this term.

Reuse the envelope.,
Offer them to others for use.,
Find creative uses for them.,
Give the envelopes to your older children for art projects.",How to Recycle Padded Envelopes2," Instead of throwing away the padded envelope, just use it again! You could easily cross off the address, and send the envelope out again, rather than prematurely tossing it into a garbage can.


If you don’t want the old address to be visible, cross it off, and then cover it with a shipping label or piece of adhesive paper on which you write the new address. That way you won’t have to throw it away.Use tape to reseal the envelope.If you have no reason to reuse the padded envelope immediately, store it in a drawer where you keep things like gift bags that you intend to reuse. There will likely come a time when you need to use it.
The good thing about padded envelopes is that you can save them literally for years. It will save you money to reuse the padded envelope, anyway, as they are more expensive than normal envelopes.

, Many communities have sites where people offer items for free to other people in the community. You can find such sites on social media or other websites most commonly.


Especially if you have padded envelopes in bulk, rather than trying to throw them away, offer them for free to anyone who needs them. Non-profits, small businesses, or community organizations, especially, might have a use for them.
You could also offer them up for free to other friends or family via your own social media sites. Neighbors might also have some use for them.
It’s almost always better to repurpose items than to risk clogging landfills with them. Padded envelopes are pretty durable and can usually withstand several uses. Try selling them on online auction sites if you have a lot of them.
Give the envelopes to a local business that you want to support. The envelopes actually cost a lot of money if you use a lot of them, so this could help someone out.

, Because padded envelopes are pretty strong, people have found creative ways to reuse them. Just because they’re envelopes doesn’t mean they have to be used for mail!Some people have even used padded envelopes to protect their knees when working on projects such as in the garden. You will prevent your knees from getting dirty or scuffed if you kneel on the envelopes while working.
Other people use the padded envelopes for storage. Common items stored in padded envelopes include jewelry or Christmas ornaments. Use bubble wrap to protect outside plants from bad weather conditions.
Bring them to sporting events or anywhere that a child might end up sitting on a hard chair. Use the padded envelope as a makeshift chair pad to prevent sore butts.

, Kids love to draw and color on unique surfaces. Let them use the envelopes for play. Keep them away from small children though, who might get hurt if the stuffing is plastic.


If you don't know anyone with children, you can donate the envelopes to a school or local art center.

Buy recycled padded mailers.,
Remove the plastic wrap.,
Return the envelope to the original shipper.",How to Recycle Padded Envelopes3," Although this won’t take care of padded envelopes that other people send you, it’s possibly for you to purchase recycled padded mailers if you need to send padded envelopes to someone else.Recycled padded mailers are available for sale online, and they are made out of recycled trash in the first place! Thus, they are more environmentally sound. Padded envelopes that are not made of mixed materials (like paper and bubble wrap) will be easier to discard.
Such envelopes may be a little more expensive than regular padded envelopes, but you will gain the peace of mind of knowing that you are not causing extra harm to the environment. There are sites on the Internet that sell recycled paper and green office supplies.Some padded envelopes are also biodegradable, so you don’t need to worry about throwing them into the trash. Check the back of the envelope to see if it's biodegradable.

, Some recycling programs in communities require that the plastic wrap be removed from the paper part of the envelope before it can be recycled.In this case, you would remove any plastic wrap and take it to a plastic film drop off location in your community, if it has one.
Throw away any leftover paper into your normal recycling bin, where you would place other paper items, such as regular envelopes or newspapers.
If the entire envelope is paper and it does not contain any plastic or bubble wrapping, you could put it directly into the recycling bin with other paper items.

, Sometimes, the person or company that sent you the envelope will be better able to reuse it than you are by sending it to another customer.


Used booksellers have been known to include postage that would enable their buyers to send the envelope back. Ask the sender if he or she would like you to return the envelope.

Separate the word into chunks.,
Start from simpler forms of the word.,
Draw on common spelling rules.",How to Spell a Difficult Word1," Slowly repeat the word out loud. Sound out each part carefully, one syllable at a time. Splitting the word into manageable parts will help you focus on the spelling of each individual section, which makes it easier to put the whole thing together.Try writing the word down syllable by syllable as you say it aloud. For instance, when you chunk out “aristocratic,” it becomes: “a - ris - to - cra - tic.” “Repetition” would be parsed out as “re - pe - ti - tion,” and “ridiculously” would become “ri - di - cu - lous - ly.”;
, Many words are tricky to spell because they’re compounds or derivations of less complicated words. If you think about the root of a complex word, it can give you a good starting point for figuring out the rest.


The easiest way to identify a word’s root is to remove any prefixes (like “un-,” “mis-,” “im-,” “re-,” “pre-,” or “inter-”) or suffixes (such as “-ly,” “-tion,” “-or,” “-ment,” “-ing,” “-like,” or “-less”) that may be attached to it.
For example, if you’re having trouble with “restructuring,” take away the prefix “re-” and suffix “-ing” to start from the most basic form of the word: “structure.” “Disconnection” could be simplified to the prefix “dis-” plus the root “connect” and suffix “-tion.” If ""derivation"" is too hard, think about how you would spell ""derive,"" then add the suffix.
Keep in mind that the last letter of a word’s root is often dropped or changed when combining it with suffixes to avoid awkward, overlapping, or repeated vowels or consonants. For instance, “disconnection” does not have two “t’s,” and “restructuring” drops the “e” from the root “structure"" to accommodate the suffix “-ing.”

, Even when a word is difficult to sound out, it may still follow a standard pattern of English that you can apply as a rule.For instance, a common rule like “i before e except after c” can help you figure out that words with an “ee” vowel sound will most likely be spelled “shield” (i before e) and “receive” (except after c).
Another example of a common spelling rule is that for words ending with an “e,” you generally drop the “e” when adding a suffix that starts with a vowel (like “-ing” or “-able”) and keep it when adding a suffix that starts with a consonant (like “-ment” or “-ly”). If you draw upon this rule, you can figure out that “homeless” and “homely” will both keep the “e” at the end of “home” while “moving” and “unmovable” will both drop the “e” from “move.”

Use ""gray"" for American English.,
Use ""grey"" for British English.,
Learn the Old English term.,
Understand that color differences are subjective.,
Remember the difference using a mnemonic device.,
Don't worry too much.,
Interchange ""gray"" and ""grey"" in verb form.,
Swap between spellings for most words and phrases.,
Know which forms are set to one spelling.",How to Spell the Color Gray," If you're in the United States, the most commonly accepted way to spell the term is with an a—""gray.""


In the United States, ""gray"" appears roughly 20 times for every appearance of ""grey."";
, If you're in the United Kingdom, Canada, or Australia, the term should be spelled with an e—""grey.""


In the United Kingdom, ""grey"" can be found roughly 20 times for every use of ""gray.""

, Both ""gray"" and ""grey"" were derived from the original Old English term referring to the same color: grǣg


Both spellings date back hundreds of years, so there's really no way to distinguish which is right and which is wrong.
It's worth noting that ""grey"" was more popular during the early 1700s in all English dialects, but by 1825, American English had primarily switched to ""gray."" As time passed, both versions became widely known, but the preference between British and American English still remains., Periodically, individuals, organizations, and others will refer to ""gray"" and ""grey"" as two slightly different colors, but such variations are purely a matter of preference rather than fact.


Both spellings primarily refer to the exact same neutral hue that exists between black and white on the color spectrum. Similarly, both spellings can also be used to refer to something that is dull or gloomy.
While there is no actual difference in color, there have been claims of such differences throughout the centuries. For example, the English chemist George Field attempted to differentiate the two in 1835 by claiming that ""gray"" referred to a cool or blue-tone shade, while ""grey"" referred to a strictly neutral one. His definition did not catch on in popular opinion, however, and is no longer observed., If you can't remember when to use ""gray"" versus ""grey,"" consider the following trick:


Match the a in ""gray"" to the a at the start of ""America,"" and the e and ""grey"" to the e at the start of ""England."" That should help you remember that ""gray"" is common in American English while ""grey"" is used in British English.
Keep in mind, however, that England is not the only country that uses ""grey."" Any country that uses British English will spell the word with an e, including all members of the United Kingdom. English dialects closer to British English (e.g. Canadian English and Australian English) also use the ""grey"" spelling.

, Even though the most widely used spelling varies by location, you don't have to worry if you accidentally forget or mix things up. Both spellings have historical basis, and both are generally accepted regardless of where you are.

, When using the term as a verb, you can spell it either way for all forms of the verb.


In other words, both ""graying"" and ""greying"" are correct, just as ""grays"" and ""greys"" or ""grayed"" and ""greyed"" would be.
As with the original term, the preference between a and e changes depending on the version of English used. Stick with a forms in American English and e forms in British English.

, Like the verb forms, most words or phrases that use the term as their root can also be spelled either way.


This applies to many single words, such as ""graybeard"" (which can also be spelled ""greybeard""), but it is especially true of multi-word phrases, like ""gray area"" (""grey area"") or ""gray matter"" (""grey matter"").
In these instances, you should still stick with the ""grey"" spelling when using British English and the ""gray"" spelling when using American English.

, In rare cases, certain terms or phrases that use the original term must stick to either the a or e spelling.


This is especially true of last names. If someone's surname is ""Gray,"" you shouldn't change it to ""Grey,"" and vice versa.
The tea Earl Grey should always be spelled with an e since its name comes from Charles Grey, the British prime minister between 1830 and 1834.While not a proper noun, ""greyhound"" should always be spelled with an e. Conversely, ""grayling"" should always be spelled with an a.

Look; cover; write; check.,
Identify common misspellings.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Consider the word’s linguistic origin.",How to Spell a Difficult Word2," This classic teaching method will effectively help you ingrain difficult-to-spell words in your mind. The process goes exactly as it sounds: you look at a word (for instance, in a dictionary) to see what it looks like, you hide the word from view and try to write it down from memory, and then you check to see if you got it right. Repeat this process until you can confidently and accurately reproduce the word at least three times in a row.To make this an even more sensory activity that connects the pronunciation of a word with its spelling, slowly sound out the word aloud as you are writing it down. That way, you’re activating your senses of sight, hearing, and touch, which will help with your recall and all-around understanding of a word., Because of its mix of linguistic origins, English spellings are not always consistent or rule-based. “Weird,” for instance, is a notable exception to the aforementioned “i before e” rule. That means it won’t always be possible to accurately spell difficult words just by sounding them out. Watch out for words that you consistently misspell and memorize the accurate spellings.Be sure to familiarize yourself with those words that are tough for everyone. There’s a list of the most commonly misspelled words available here: http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/misspelled_words.htm

Try creating your own crib sheet of words that you find difficult to spell. Keep it on hand when you’re writing to look up the ones that commonly trip you up.

, It’s easier to remember difficult spellings if you associate it with a vivid sentence that gives you a way to recall the right letters.For example, if you have trouble spelling a word like “rhythm,” come up with a related sentence in which the beginning of each word matches the correct order of the letters: “Rhythm helps you to hear music.”
If you have trouble with a specific letter, think of a sentence that will help you remember the part that you frequently mess up. For instance, “separate” is one of the most commonly misspelled words, but if you associate it with a sentence like, “There’s a ‘par’ in separate,” then you’ll remember that the second vowel should be an “a,” not an “e.”

, Many English words are imported from other languages. If you know which language a word is derived from, it can help you make sense of surprising letter combinations that don’t match how a word sounds. The more you familiarize yourself with patterns that are common to the languages that have influenced English, like Latin, French, and German, the more likely you are to be able to figure out the spellings of words that have foreign origins.For instance, words like “bureaucracy” and “connoisseur” seem like they would be spelled “burocracy” and “connosewer” in English. However, if you know their origin, you can recognize the vowel and consonant patterns as foreign spellings that are standard in French.
You can look up word origins in a dictionary to familiarize yourself with common patterns, roots, prefixes, and suffixes that derive from other languages. If you know that “pneu” comes from the Greek word for “breathe,” it will help you recognize that prefix in other places that it’s likely to occur, such as “pneumonia” or “pneumatic.”Download an etymology app like WordBook or Etymology Explorer to help you look up the foreign roots of tough words.

Group words by suffix. The suffix ""-OUS"" often sounds just like the suffix ""-OSE,"" so it can be challenging to remember which word ends with which suffix. Try to group ""OUS"" and ""OSE"" separately. This will help you to distinguish the difference.

, You’ve got your list and you’ve organized it, but you’re probably already familiar with a good number of those words. Try to identify which words are most challenging. This way, you’ll have somewhere to begin, and you won’t waste time on words you already know. You can do this several ways:


Read through your list, checking ones you are confident about, and marking ones you might struggle with. You might notice themes about what sort of words you miss.
Take a couple pre-tests using your organized word list. Have a friend or family member help you with this by randomly selecting words and running through them quickly. Remember, this is just a diagnostic to see what sort of words challenge you. You don’t have to get them all right, and you don’t have to spend two full minutes spelling them.
Make sure to still incorporate words you are more comfortable with into your rotation a couple of times. Just don’t focus on them as much as other, more challenging, words.

, Once you’ve figured out what words challenge you, you need to make a plan for how you will move through your list in a limited amount of time. You need to make a plan so that you can cover all of your words quickly at least three times. Preferably, you want to cover tougher words four or five times (or until you’re comfortable with those words). Consider a few things:


Your limited amount of time.
Days you might be too busy to study.
Periodic tests and quizzes.
Extra time for extra challenging words., Find yourself a good dictionary and some websites that will help you study. Your dictionary is going to be your most important study resource, so it should be one that you are comfortable using. In addition, websites will make studying a bit more fun, and perhaps easier.


Dictionaries can be bought at pretty much any book store, but make sure to get one that is recommended and/or approved by your spelling bee organization. A good dictionary will show a word’s root, phonetic spelling, common usage, and even origin. Oxford is a good choice, but Merriam-Webster’s is the official choice of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, and many smaller spelling bee organizations also recommend it.
Vocabulary.com has a very helpful word list building tool. See it at https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/vocabgrabber

Take a look at Merriam-Webster’s Word Central at http://www.wordcentral.com/. If you are a younger spelling bee competitor, you can play games and build your own dictionary of tough words!

, Make sure to get a notebook in order to store your word lists and the paper that you’ll be writing on when studying. A good organized notebook with your main word list, lists of challenging words, notes, definitions, and more, will be critical to your success.

, Go over spelling and definition for each word. Be very systematic about this process so you cover all of your words in a timely fashion. Remember, though, since you don't have much time, don't focus too much on definitions!

, Learning roots, prefixes, and suffixes will help you understand word construction and origin much better. Word spelling will make much more sense rather than being ""magic."" See a chart of common roots, prefixes and suffixes at http://www.prefixsuffix.com/rootchart.php.


Roots. When looking at your words of the day, pay attention to the roots--where the word is derived from. In your dictionary, you can see the root in the etymology section of the word entry. This will usually follow the pronunciation and part of speech, but come before the definition. Many of the words we use have Latin roots, many of the words used in science and philosophy come to us from Greek, and there are others from French, Spanish, German and more.
Prefixes. A prefix is a word, letter, or number attached to the beginning of a word that serves to create a derivative word. For instance: ""inter"" is a prefix that means between, and ""rupt"" is from a Latin root meaning ""to break.""
Suffixes. A suffix is added at the end of a word to create a derivative word. For instance, ""able"" is a suffix meaning ""capable of or tending to"" that is attached to the end of words. To demonstrate, let's take the Latin ""amicus"" which means friend. Adding a suffix of ""able"" will create the new word, ""amicable. The new word means ""having a spirit of friendliness."", Sound your words out. For instance, ""a-mic-a-ble."" You now know the root ""amicus"" and the suffix ""able,"" so this should be easier. But remember, sounding out words won't work all the time. Some words with silent vowels or certain root words will be very challenging.

, Associating the word with the definition is very important to this process. When encountering a word you don't know the meaning of, use your dictionary to look it up. Also, try highlighting roots, suffixes, and prefixes -- this will help you memorize the word better.

, Each time you see the new word, find out how it is pronounced (see your dictionary) and then practice the correct pronunciation out loud. You may want to check with someone else and have them say the word, too.

, This is a good trick that will help you visualize the word as you spell it out verbally. Spelling words out in the air will also help you focus.

, Have a family member, friend, teacher, or anyone else that you can find read off the words to you. Then write them down or spell them out verbally., Make sure to test yourself every three days so you know how you’re progressing. As with your initial test, don’t try to get every word right, and don’t use the full two minutes that you’ll be allocated in the spelling bee. Do this quickly just to see where your strengths and weaknesses lie. The Scripps National Spelling Bee also has a webpage that will help you to test yourself online, see it at https://secure.spellingbee.com/tests/publicsample/?page=word

, After you’ve tested or quizzed yourself, examine your results to see what type of words you are getting wrong. It might be words with lots of vowels, or it might be “OUS” words, or another specific type of word. Focus on these. After two or three tests, you’ll begin to get a very good idea of where your weaknesses are, and you’ll be able to spend more time on those tougher words.

, Remove words from your rotation after 3 times if you are confident you know that word. Replace those words with more challenging words. Gradually, you will cycle easy words out and hard ones in.

, A couple days before the spelling bee, hold a final test with twenty to thirty randomly selected words. Have a friend or family member read the words to you, and allow yourself two minutes to spell each word. Go through everything we’ve covered here, including spelling the word in the air. This way, you’ll have an idea of how it will feel to compete on the big day!"
"
Make up creative ways to memorize the words.,
Study daily up until the competition.,
Pick an area to study.,
During regular chores/activities, think about the words.,
Get Help.,
Relax before the competition.,
Have an interest in memorizing words.",How to Memorize Words for a Spelling Bee," For an example, the word arithmetic. It sounds fairly hard, right? Well, think of the word this way: A-rat-in-the-house-might-eat-the-ice-cream. Take the first letter of each word and you get: ""arithmetic."" Now, when that caller says, ""ARITHMETIC!"" you'll know exactly what to spell. Although this might not work if you need to learn 400 words, but it will definitely help if you are struggling with 1 or 2.;
, As soon as you get the study guide, start studying. Whenever you have free time, before you go to bed at night, it doesn't matter. But not having to cram three days before the Spelling Bee really does make a difference...if your brain learns the words slowly instead of rapidly, it will give you time to process the information--plus, your brain doesn't enjoy having to handle so much stress which is caused by impossible words and very little time.

, A nice, quiet room with good lighting would be an ideal place. Choose a day where you have nothing else to worry about, time, and your ready-to-think brain. Also, make sure there are as little distractions as possible. (TVs, the neighbor's dog barking, music, etc; should not be heard/seen at this time.)

, This can be done in any way, really. Like, while you are walking the dog, spell the word c-a-n-i-n-e in your head. Or, when you are doing the laundry, d-e-t-e-r-g-e-n-t. You should probably do this after your study--don't try to guess how to spell a word, you may misspell it. (English has some very weird rules that are sometimes not followed.)

, If you are struggling over a few words. Don't stress out. Get a reliable adult or friend to help you test on your spelling words.

, You've studied, you've worked, you've done everything you can--now it's time to shine! Study as little as possible during this time, you probably just want to kick back and watch a movie. (Try to watch Akeelah and The Bee, it has some good tips.)br>

, Interest is of importance in study. If you are lazy and want to do nothing, you won't memorize words any more.

Write it out, speak it aloud, and practice.",How to Memorize the Spelling of a Word," Breaking down the word into syllables through exaggerated pronunciation, reviewing your phonics knowledge, studying spelling conventions and patterns, and keeping a word list for repetitious practice can greatly benefit adult learners.


Keep your own spelling notebook on hand. Particularly if you are a visual learner, identifying new words to spell and practicing during free time will help you better remember how to spell the word.Consistent practice spelling your chosen words will etch the spelling into your memory.
Review the “rules” of spelling to help you become a more proficient speller. For example, did you remember that the letter ‘c’ represents the sound /k/ when followed by an ‘a’, ‘o’, or ‘u’ (think cat, cot, cut), but represents the sound /s/ when followed by an ‘e’, ‘i’ or ‘y’ (think center, city, cycle)?Utilize online resources that are designed to improve spelling ability. Websites can be a helpful tool for practicing spelling in your spare time. There are also mobile apps that can help you drill spelling.;
, Mnemonics can be helpful to memorize the spelling of tricky words. While these memory aids are probably not effective for memorizing the spelling of a large number of words, they can be extremely helpful for memorizing a small number of complex words. You can use common mnemonics, or make up your own.


Develop short phrases for complicated words. For example, “Necessary = 1 collar and 2 socks (to remember one ‘c’ and two ‘s’s).”
Try spelling mnemonics that use a phrase. For example, “Rhythm = Rhythm Helps Your Two Hips Move.” Make up rhymes. For example, “‘I’ before ‘E’, except after ‘C’, or when sounded ‘A’, as in neighbor and weigh.”
Compose nonsense stories. “In order to remember that ‘cemetery’ is spelled with three ‘e’s’, think of a lady shrieking “e-e-e!” as she walks past a cemetery.” , Many commonly used words have roots in other languages, and understanding these roots can be helpful in both improving your vocabulary and memorizing the spelling of words. Because different languages abide by different spelling conventions, knowing the origin of a word can sometimes provide assistance in spelling it.Recognizing that long words often have a base which carries a specific meaning and remains constant despite the sound we hear can help with spelling. Learn some common Greek roots to help with spelling. For example, the Greek ‘ped’, meaning ‘foot’, is present in the words peddle, pedal, pedicure, and pedestrian, and the Greek ‘poli’, meaning ‘city’, can be found in metropolis, police, cosmopolitan, and political.
Learn simple Latin roots to help with spelling. The Latin ‘ject’, meaning ‘to throw’, can be found in reject, eject, injection, and projectile, while the Latin ‘cred’, meaning ‘to believe’, can be found in incredible, credit, credible, incredulous, and credo.

, This is a fun and interactive way to advance your child’s exposure to language, expand their vocabulary, and introduce spelling. Conversing while engaging with these projects will increase language capacity, which is the foundation of good spelling. Good spellers are usually also good readers and good speakers.Speak out loud. Spelling the words out loud as you write will introduce your child to verbal spelling.
Make labeling a family activity. Encourage decoration of labels, or repetition of letters as you spell out the objects.
Have your child trace words. Hold your child on your lap (or next to you) and place your hand over his, helping him to print a word while saying the word out loud and spelling the letters as you go.
Try fingerpainting. This is a fun and involved way to learn letters and words. Fun introductions to spelling are the first step to learning how to successfully memorize the spelling of a word.

, In addition to seeing words, which develops “visual memory,” children also need to enhance their “spelling memory”, or memory for letter sequences. This memory is enhanced by a child’s recognition of various phonemes, or speech sounds, used to construct words. Begin spelling with short words that are easy to sound out (think ‘cap’, ‘bat’, and ‘sit’ instead of ‘cape’, ‘bait’, or ‘sight’0.Use words in which the letter sounds correspond to their most common sounds (think “gram” instead of “gem”).Start by pronouncing and spelling these words and have your child repeat after you, and progress to asking your child to spell these words on his own.
Introduce words in a logical pattern, beginning with words that adhere to the most basic and frequently encountered conventions. This will help your child see spelling conventions in words and learn to generalize from these words to others., In order to learn the conventions of spelling and apply these conventions to other words, it is essential for your child to learn the correct pronunciation of his spelling words.


Alternate between pronunciation and spelling. For example: “House. H-O-U-S-E. House.”
Exaggerate pronunciation to teach the correlation between pronunciation and spelling. Encouraging children to remember to “pronounce it for spelling” can help them spell the word correctly in the future.Point out that not all words are spelled as they are pronounced. Words like “stranger”, “bomb”, and “should” can be confusing.

, Be supportive of attempts at spelling. Learning how to spell and memorizing the spelling of a word will take practice. It is important to build your child’s confidence in spelling and avoid feelings of frustration or anger in association with spelling.


Practice spelling in short bursts. Require fifteen minutes of spelling review after school, fifteen minutes after soccer practice, and fifteen minutes after supper. Shorter and more frequent periods of practice are often more effective than one long review session.Introduce 12-15 new words each week from second grade (age 8-9) on.Choose these words from reading material that your child may encounter in other classes, or pick groups of words that exhibit similar spelling conventions.
Review old words as you introduce new words. Repetition is key in learning how to spell.

, Various languages sound different and look different as well. Just as you learned the ABC’s as a child, learning the alphabet of your intended language is the first place to start. You may encounter a few characters you’ve never seen before, or the language may look totally different to what you know.


Identify characters that you do not have in your native language. For example, English speakers will recognize the letter ‘n’, while Spanish speakers need to know both ‘n’ and ‘ñ’, and French speakers will have to know ‘ç’ in addition to ‘c’.
Understand the function of these characters in a word and how they are pronounced. Directly learning the sounds of the language and the letters those sound sequences represent will facilitate spelling., Just as a child learns to spell in his native language, you will need to start at the beginning. Breaking down words into syllables through exaggerated pronunciation and exploring patterns of pronunciation and spelling will help you learn to spell in any language.


Review spelling patterns and the correlation between pronunciation and spelling. Break words down and identify any root words, if possible.
Identify and pay specific attention to non-phonetic words. Understanding the spelling patterns and conventions of the language will help you identify these words.
Use mnemonic devices or repetition to memorize both these patterns and the words to which they patterns apply.
Be patient. Learning how to memorize the spelling of a word in your native language took time and effort. This will too.

, It is best if you can have your written or spoken spelling checked by a native speaker. A native speaker will have a more keen sense of how to convey the conventions of his or her language and will be able to more effectively identify patterns of mistakes that you may be making in your spelling.


Speak with a native speaker to ensure that you are pronouncing words correctly.
Read in the language you wish to learn, and identify complex words for spelling practice.
Practice spelling words by writing them in a notebook and testing yourself.
Have a friend (and if possible, a native speaker) give you a spelling test out loud. This will help you better associate pronunciation and spelling.

Start with some simple words.,
Pronounce the word out loud, how it sounds like it should be pronounced.,
Read.,
Remember the simple rules of spelling.

,
Learn the pronunciation of letters put together.,
Do not attempt a spelling once, or even twice.",How to Learn to Remember Spellings of Words," As silly as it sounds, starting with the most complicated words will not help you learn how to spell quicker and will most probably confuse you. Start off with basic words with a predictable letter pattern where the grammar is not abnormal.;
, Wednesday sounds like Wensday, so instead of pronouncing it as such pronounce it Wed-nez-day. This will help you remember how it is spelled.

, One of the greatest tools to learning spelling, grammar and punctuation is reading. By reading a variety of different books you are unknowingly reinforcing the spelling on many words over and over again as you read it.


Get someone to test you. When you think you have learned the spelling, have someone who knows how to spell it test you on your spelling. If you can spell the word correctly, you can move onto a slightly more difficult spelling.

,, Hoqe Qu, Th, Sh and Ch sound, amongst others.

, Your learning to spell a word is an ongoing process and should not just be attempted a few times. Even once you have got a spelling, don't forget to revise it every so often, as you may forget it's spelling if it hasn't stuck in your head far enough.

Teach her how to make words plural.,
Teach her when to drop the final ""e."" When adding an ending to a word that ends in ""e,"" you employ different rules.,
Look at other common prefixes and suffixes.,
Discuss silent letters.,
Talk about homophones.,
Focus on reading.,
Work on etymology.",How to Get a Child Ready for a Spelling Bee1," Breaking spelling down to the basics can help a child spell a word even if she's never heard it before. One of the basic rules you can teach her is how to make words plural.Start with the most basic, adding ""s."" Explain that most words just take an ""s"" to make them plural.Move to ""es."" Let her know that you add ""es"" with words in ending in ch, sh, s, x, or z most of the time, as in ""box"" to ""boxes.""Explain the rules for words ending in ""y."" Much of the time, when you have a vowel and a ""y,"" you simply add an ""s,"" like with ""boys."" However, with a consonant and a ""y,"" you usually add ""ies,"" like with ""babies.""Explain how words ending in ""f"" or ""fe"" can differ. Sometimes, words ending in ""f"" or ""fe"" change the ""f"" to a ""v"" and add ""es,"" as in ""knife"" to ""knives.""Watch for words ending in ""o."" Some words ending in ""o"" just take an ""s,"" while sometimes when a consonant comes before the ""o,"" it takes an ""es"" instead, as in ""heroes."";
, The rules affect whether you keep the ""e"" or not, and having your child learn the rules can help her spell variations on rules.When the word ends with a silent ""e"" and the ending begins with a vowel, you drop the ""e,"" so ""name"" becomes ""naming.""If your ending begins with a consonant, you keep the ""e,"" such as how ""advance"" becomes ""advancement."" However, if the word ends in two vowels, you can drop the ""e,"" such as when ""argue"" becomes ""argument.""

, Knowing how common prefixes and suffixes are spelled can help your kid sound out words. Start by getting a primer on the basic prefixes and suffixes, and use it to go over the basics with your child.Prefixes, such as ""dis"" or ""in,"" often do not change the spelling of the main word, making them easier to learn.For instance, ""interested"" becomes ""disinterested,"" without changing the main word.
Suffixes, such as ""ing,"" ""ous,"" and ""ed,"" often do change the spelling of the main word, so they can be a bit harder to learn. For instance, ""advance"" becomes ""advancing,"" dropping the silent ""e,"" as noted previously.

, Silent letters can be killers for new (and even old) spellers. Talk with your child about the most common silent letters that she may encounter.For instance, ""b"" is a common silent letter at the end of the word in words like ""lamb"" or ""comb.""
""K"" is often silent as well. Common examples include ""knowledge"" and ""knight.""
""P"" and ""L"" are both silent in ""psalm,"" while ""n"" can't be heard in words like ""hymn"" or ""autumn."" ""S"" becomes silent in ""island"" or ""isle,"" while ""w"" is silent in ""write.""
Other letters that can become silent include ""a,"" ""c,"" ""d,"" ""t,"" and ""u.""Go over common words with silent letters, especially ones on her list.

, Homophones are words that sound the same or similar but have different spellings and meanings. They can be very confusing to new spellers.Discuss common homonyms such as where/wear, their/there/they're, which/witch, and are/our.
While pronunciation can help in a few cases, work with your child to understand that the only way to tell some words apart is by asking for the definition.Have your kid use memory tricks to help her tell common words apart. For instance, you could use ""Witches like to scratch their itches with broomsticks."" to help her tell it apart from ""which.""

, Kids who read regularly pick up spelling more easily. The more often they are exposed to correct spelling, the more likely they are to pick up that word.


Encourage your kid to read everyday. If she doesn't like to read by herself, sit down and read with her. She'll be more accepting if she gets to spend time with you.
Make her sound out words as she goes, so she can start associating certain spellings with certain sounds.

, Etymology refers to a word's history, including the root language it came from.English has incorporated words from many other languages over the years. Latin and French, for instance, have both had a significant impact, and knowing when a word is derived from one of these languages can help give a clue about how to spell it.German is also a heavy influence.Explore words by language groupings. Many websites offer this service, and it can help your child learn how words from a particular language can have common spellings.For instance, words from German are heavy on consonants, and they often have more internal and ending ""z""s than other English words, such as ""glitz,"" ""pretzel,"" or ""waltz.""French words, on the other hand, are often heavier on vowels, to the point that consonant sounds are sometimes softened, like with the ""g"" in ""collage"" or the ""ch"" in ""chagrin."""

Understand the meaning of the word “affect”.,
Be aware of what part of speech “affect” is.,
Try using “affect” in a sentence.,
Understand that “affect” can sometimes be used as a noun.","How to Know the Difference Between ""Affect"" and ""Effect""1"," “Affect” means to make a change in something. Another way of looking at is it influences objects or things. It comes from a Latin word meaning “acted upon.”;
, Most of the time, “affect” is used as a verb. A verb is the action in a sentence. The subject (a noun or pronoun) does the action. So someone or something (the noun) is affecting (the verb) something else.

, Consider something that changes or influences something else. You could talk about rain changing water levels or a well-written novel moving someone. Sentences that properly use the word “affect” and address these topics include:


“The heavy rain affected the water levels in the local lake.”
“The tense, detailed writing affected him, moving him to tears.”

, When “affect” is used as a noun, it generally describes a person’s facial expressions. Examples include:


”The murderer took the news of the jury’s decision with little affect.”"
"
Start by saying the word.,
Count the sounds in the word.,
Place a blank for each sound.,
Help her write down the correct spelling.,
Write the word as a whole.",How to Get a Child Ready for a Spelling Bee2," Work together to figure out the sounds in a word. For instance, say the word is ""rough."" Extend the word out as you say it: ""rrrrr uuu fff."" Stutter consonants if you need to do so.Word mapping is learning to associate pronunciation with letter groupings. It shows children that a word is a meaningful group of letters rather than just something to be memorized as a whole., Once you've sounded out the word together, help her count how many sounds she hears. In the case of ""rough,"" she likely can hear three sounds. If she's having trouble hearing them, sound out the word again, more slowly., Now that you've counted each sound, you need to set up the word for spelling. Have her write a blank for each sound she hears.For instance, with ""rough,"" she'll have three blanks, one for the ""r"" sound, one for the ""u"" sound, and one for the ""f"" sound.

, For each sound, you're now going to write down the proper spelling of the sound in the blank. So in the first blank, you'd write ""r,"" while in the second blank, you'd write ""ou."" In the final blank, you'd right ""gh.""Talk about the hard parts of the word. For instance, ""ou"" makes a short ""u"" sound in ""tough"" (/u/).Also, the ""gh"" makes the ""f"" sound at the end.

, Once you've looked at the individual sounds, be sure to write the word as a whole. Have her write out ""rough"" below the three blanks.It's also important to provide context for the word by giving its meaning.
Practice with similar words. Give her words that are similar, like ""tough,"" and have her try to do the steps on her own.

"
"
Use tricks to help her remember specific words.,
Make the letters in the word into a sentence.,
Tell her to always check the spelling.,
Have her keep a journal.,
Encourage the child to look for similar sounds.",How to Get a Child Ready for a Spelling Bee3," Sometimes, a child can get hung up on certain words, never able to remember exactly how it goes. It can help to make up a silly little phrase or saying as a reminder. For instance, some people use ""there's a rat in the middle"" to help them remember how to spell ""separate.""Anything that helps her reminder the word is fine--the sillier, the better.
For instance, try something like ""That person is named Ali Ty"" for ""personality.""

, Another way to help a kid remember is to use the letters to make a sentence with each word in the sentence starting with one of the letters. This method is a common mnemonic or memory device. Once again, sillier phrases can help a child remember better.For instance, to help her to remember to spell ""dessert,"" try ""Debbie eats strawberry shakes every Tuesday."" The strawberry shake should also help trigger her memory.
For ""trouble,"" try ""Theresa rescued one unlucky beetle-like earmite.""

, Practicing the spelling of a word helps commit it to memory. However, if she's not sure how to spell it, it's important to look it up. That way, she's sure she's not practicing it the wrong way.In addition, the process of looking it up can help commit to memory.
Try using an actual paper dictionary for looking up words. Sometimes, the physical act of looking up a word can help solidify it., One way to learn more words is to keep a journal of interesting words you come across. Have your child create one. She should write words down that she comes across that are interesting or she doesn't (spelled correctly). If she doesn't know the spelling, have her look it up.


Writing the meaning down can help her remember it, too.

, Once she starts learning words, try to help her make connections between similar-sounding words. You can help her along by grouping similar words together, then try to help her find other words that fit the pattern.


For instance, you might work with ""television,"" ""telephone,"" and ""telekinesis."" While the words all have different endings, they have the same basic pattern at the beginning.

"
"
Teach the child to listen carefully to pronunciation.,
Use word spelling games.,
Identify words giving her issues.,
Make a trace, copy, and remember guide.,
Have her practice.,
Throw in a few words she doesn't know.",How to Get a Child Ready for a Spelling Bee4," Often, kids will get the pronunciation of a word wrong. In turn, they won't spell it correctly. At a spelling bee, though, the person calling the words will be careful to say the word perfectly. Teach your child to listen to the pronunciation and spell it in turn.Try working with hard words with her that are often mispronounced. For instance, ""jewelry"" is often mispronounced as ""jewelery"" or ""jewelry,"" which could lead to misspelling.
Say the word clearly and have her repeat the pronunciation before trying to spell it.

, Online, you can find a wide variety of word spelling games. Some of them even let you input a set of words, so you can focus on the words your kid needs to learn. Others will let you set words by grade level.Be sure to check out the website first to see if it's safe for kids.
These games help her practice her words over and over, solidifying them in her memory, while keeping it fun at the same time.

, When preparing, try to note which words are giving her issues in particular. Once you note which ones are making her stumble, focus on those for some of the mnemonic devices listed in this article.For instance, if she always messes up on ""cleaver,"" try making up a silly phrase for it.
Also, if your kid gets frustrated when she's having trouble spelling a word, the silly phrase can help diffuse the tension.

, Divide a piece of paper into three columns. The first column is the ""trace"" column, where your child traces over the word. The second column is the ""copy"" column, where she writes the word herself but is able to look at the first column. The third column is the ""remember"" column. Once she's done the first two, she folds the paper over on itself so the first column is covering the second column. Then she tries to write the word from memory. You can also fold back the ""remember"" column and flip the paper over to that side.In the ""trace"" column, fill in a list of words she needs to learn for the spelling bee, writing carefully.
While she's tracing the letters, have her practice spelling it as she would at the the spelling bee. For instance, if the word is ""simple,"" have her say ""simple,"" then name the letters as she's tracing them, then say ""simple"" again. Have her do it again each time she writes it., Even if your child knows all the words, it won't do her any good if she gets up in front of the room and freezes. She needs to practice her words, spelling-bee style.


Use her list of words that she needs to spell. Make sure to have definitions ready if she asks.
Gather the family or a few friends. Have her stand up in front of you. Give her a word to spell. You can even make it a family event by having a family spelling bee.
Make sure she uses the correct format of stating the word first, spelling it, and then stating it again.

, When it comes to practice, try giving her a few words that she hasn't practiced but may be able to spell because of their similarity to words she knows. She's likely to come across a word she doesn't know in the spelling bee, and she needs to learn how to work it out.


If she says, ""I don't know,"" encourage her to sound it out. If she gets it wrong, tell her it was a good try, and give her the correct spelling. Help her see how it connects to other words she knows.
Praise her for trying to work it out, whether she gets it wrong or right.
If she freezes, try to talk her through it. Say things like, ""Now what word does that sound like?"" For instance, if the word is ""night,"" another hint could be, ""It sounds awfully like another word we've been practicing that begins with an 'r.'""

Learn the meaning of the word “effect”.,
Understand what part of speech the word “effect” is.,
Try using “effect” in a sentence.,
Keep in mind that effect can sometimes be used as a verb.","How to Know the Difference Between ""Affect"" and ""Effect""2"," “Effect” means a change that has been brought about by something else. It comes from a Latin word meaning “to bring about.”

, Usually, “effect” is used as a noun. Therefore, it will often be paired with an article, such as “an” or “the.”

, Consider something that would cause something else to happen. Maybe the cat changed something on the table or the rain changed the water levels, like in the previous example. Sentences that use “effect” properly include:


“The cat’s leaping had a noticeable effect on the glassware on the table.”
“The rain’s effect was noticeable, as the lake’s water levels had risen.”

, Though “effect” can be used as a verb, it has a direct object in the sentence. A direct object is something that follows the verb that answers the question “how” or “what,” such as “I paint houses.” “Houses” is the direct object.


When “effect” is used as a verb, it always takes a direct object. In this case, “effect” means “to cause something to happen.” A sentence would be, “Our new boss has effected some positive changes”"

Break down the word.,
Identify prefixes and suffixes.,
Guess at spellings based on other words.,
Memorize extra difficult words by pronouncing each syllable.",How to Learn the Spelling of Words Quickly1," When you think of a word you don't know how to spell, don't panic. Step back and break the word into parts, either in your head or with pen and paper. Even when the spelling doesn't match the sound, this method will teach you to recognize common spelling patterns.



Example: Break ""constraint"" into ""con — strain — t."" The second and third part are spelled how they sound. The vowel in ""con"" might not be obvious from the sound, but if you keep breaking down words you'll notice that the spelling ""con"" appears many times.;
, Many English words are formed from two or more parts. When possible, break words down into a ""root word,"" a ""prefix"" at the beginning, and/or a ""suffix"" at the end. Each prefix or suffix appears on many words, and almost always has the same meaning and spelling each time.



Example: Break ""independence"" into ""in — depend — ence"":
1.""In"" is a prefix that means ""not""
2. ""Depend"" is the root word
3. The suffix ""ence"" is probably the hardest to spell, but you only need to learn it once and you'll recognize it at the end of many words.

, When you have no idea how to spell part of a word, write down other words that include a similar sound. Chances are good that the mystery word is spelled the same way. This isn't foolproof, but it's much better than choosing a spelling at random.



Example: ""Independence"" might sound like it ends with an ""s"" at first — but ""fence"" has a much closer sound than ""pens."" This makes the ""ence"" spelling more likely to be correct (which it is).

, Some words have such weird spellings that they are difficult to remember even after breaking them into parts. Try ignoring the real pronunciation and instead pronouncing each syllable as it's written.



Example: The military rank ""colonel"" is pronounced ""kernel,"" which doesn't sound anything like the spelling. To help you memorize the spelling, chant the word as it looks: ""col – o - nel.""

Example 2: This trick is especially useful for long words. Say the word ""congratulation"" as ""con-grat-u-la-ti-on."" Once you're 100% sure about the ""tion"" ending, you can shorten this to ""con-grat-u-la-shun.""
Exaggerate the vowel sounds to make sure they sound different from each other. E, I, and A are easily confused if you're not careful.

Inspect what you have written, and think about which word you are using and decide how to spell the word you are concerned of using correctly.,
Use there when referring to a certain place; compare ""there"" to ""here"" and ""where"".,
Compare there are, to ""here are"" and ""where are"".,
Use their and theirs to indicate possession.,
Remember that they're is a contraction of the phrase they are.,
Ask test questions.,
Recognize incorrect examples and learn from the mistakes.,
Practice, practice, practice!","How to Use There, Their and They're"," (Of course, your word would logically have followed information indicating or naming of whom or about what you were talking.) The chosen word would need to agree with its ""subject/topic"" to which you refer., The place can be either concrete (""over here or there by the building"") or more abstract (""it must be difficult to be there in your mind"")., There plus a ""to be"" verb such as ""are"" indicates the existence of something mentioned.


""There are antiques here -- where? Look there. Oh, and, see here we've found them!""
""Are there many of the documents stored here? Yes, see them here, where they are safe. Do you see where they are -- right over there!?""
""There will be a picnic here, and there is a monstrous campground over there across the river. There is one of the places where they are staying tonight.""

, Compare to ""heir"" -- to inherit possessions as ""an heir of their uncle who had no children."" Their is a possessive adjective and indicates that a particular noun belongs to them.""Sam and Jan are heirs of their parents' land and possessions as ""their legal heirs"".""
""Their things were broken."" Compare ""Our things were broken."" Yes, it shows possession.
""I see their flowers are blooming in their garden."" ""Yes, from the seeds their grandmother gave to them last fall.""

, It is not a modifier, but only a pronoun (for a name of who or what) plus the contraction "" 're"" of the verb ""are"" (a state of being verb).They're my friends."" Check that "" They are my friends."" makes sense. Yes!
I would go with you, but they're going to take me. Check, "" they are going to take me"". Yes!

, Ask yourself these questions, but they may not work in a few cases:

For there, will the sentence still make sense, if you replace ""there"" with here or where? If so, it's right.
For their, will the sentence still make sense -- if you replace ""their"" with our (to see whether it is a possessive sentence), but of course that test phrase would change to whom it belongs. Ours belongs to us, but theirs belongs to them. Still, if ""our"" fits logically it is right because it is possessive.
For they're, will the sentence still make sense, if you replace ""they're"" with they are? If so, it's right, but if not, then they're is the wrong word.

, By looking over others' work with a critical eye, especially by offering proofreading or copyediting help, you can become more sensitized to correct usage and practice it yourself.


Wrong: Their is no one here.
Wrong: Shelley wants to know if there busy.
Wrong: The dogs are happily chewing on they're bones.
RIGHT: I can't believe they're leaving their children there, alone!

Make a visual connection between a difficult and easy word.,
Remember the appearance of the word on the page.,
Try to write a mnemonic for each spelling.",How to Learn the Spelling of Words Quickly2," People are much better at remembering images than spelling. If you keep making a spelling mistake, come up with a simple visual idea that connects the difficult word with an easy word that has a similar spelling.



Example: The word ""gherkin"" (meaning pickle) has the same ""gh"" start as the word ""ghost."" Think of a ghost holding a gherkin, and you'll train your brain to think ""gherkin → ghost → they both start with 'gh'.""
Making connections to an unrelated idea is often helpful when you're trying to memorize any information. This technique is called a ""donkey bridge.""

, If you can't think of a word to connect it to, there's another way to create a visual idea, although it can take some creativity. Write the difficult word in large letters on a piece of paper. Focus on the letter or letters you have trouble with, and draw (or imagine) a picture that looks like those letters. It may help to include the meaning of the word in your image.



Example: If you keep spelling ""citadel"" (meaning castle) with two ""L""s, picture a citadel with a single, tall tree to the right of it. This may remind you that there's only one ""l"" at the end of the word.

, A mnemonic is a silly phrase that's easy to remember and tells you something about the word. One easy way to make a mnemonic is to write a sentence by turning each letter into a full word. Silly but simple sentences are best.



Example: To remember the spelling of ""because,"" think of ""Big Elephants Can't Always Use Small Exits.""

Learn the meaning of the word.,
Make flash cards and carry them around wherever you go.,
Write each word on a different sticky note.,
Write the word repeatedly.,
Smell something pleasant while studying.",How to Learn the Spelling of Words Quickly3," You're much more likely to remember a word if you're comfortable with its definition. This doesn't just mean memorizing the vocab list. Try to use it in a sentence, or search online for examples of how people use the word in writing.

, Whenever you have a spare five minutes, quiz yourself with them.

, Stick a spelling on every wall of your room, item on your desk, and anywhere else you run into them. Include the meaning of the word on the sticky note.


If you're studying words in a foreign language, stick the notes to the objects they describe. For spelling in your native language, just stick them anywhere.

, Think of Bart Simpson at the chalkboard. Writing out a word that many times gets boring fast, but sometimes it's the only way to make it stick in your head.


Try writing the word with your non-dominant hand (the hand you don't normally write with). This forces your brain to put in more effort, which may sharpen your attention.

, The sense of smell is closely linked to memory. If you sniff the same scent while you study and when you take the test, it may boost your ability to remember what you learned. Dried flowers or scented soap are a couple example of strong-smelling objects you can bring to school.

Read in your spare time.,
Pick a few words to learn at a time.,
Turn off auto correct.",How to Learn the Spelling of Words Quickly4," Reading will improve your spelling without you even realizing it. Each word you read is another reminder of how that word is spelled. And as the exercises above showed, even knowing how to spell simple words can help you spell words you've never seen before.


When you find a word you don't know, spell it out loud. Write down the word a few times.

, When you find a useful or interesting word while reading, in conversation, or in class, write it down. Every day, write down each word on your list three times and spell it out loud. Literally one minute of this ""studying"" each day will teach you the spelling quite quickly. Remove words from the list once you're confident you know the spelling. Add new words to replace them.

, If your phone or computer correct your spelling for you, you're missing a chance to reinforce the correct spellings. Turn off this feature so you don't reinforce bad habits by entering the wrong spelling repeatedly.

If you win the school spelling bee you will be moved onto the regional bee and then so on. The winner of that bee will be announced on February 1st.;
, The requirements are listed below, however your school will have the requirements and check before having you compete.

, Try to memorize the tougher words in the dictionary. Those words are more likely to be asked than easy words, such as versatile. Also, many schools hand out a paper with words that will be asked in the next stage of your competition. Study these for the most part as they will guide you through the first stages of the competition.

, Try the ""Spell It!"" word list. It is an excellent site for studying. It includes spelling tips, origins, and definitions.

, Try studying for two hours a day, every day.

, Avoid loud colors and sloppy clothing. Black, white, and/or grey are safe colors.

, Keep jewellery subtle, such as small stud pearls or gold studs. Pull back your hair from your face into a braid or a low bun.

, The spelling bee isn't really very dressy until the finals. Always wear black loafers. Just nicely brush your hair back, and you are set. Don't go to crazy on the tie.

, It can be hard to find comfortable dress shoes and clothes, but you don't want to be distracted by a pinching shoe.

, It seems like you are clapping for yourself, which is inappropriate.

, Ask questions as needed.

,, It's okay to be excited, though!

, Be proud of how far you went. Just to make it to the Bee is amazing!

, It can be tempting, but also tends to cause lowered performance during bee week.

, Go to sleep at 8:00 P.M and wake up 3 hours before it starts. This gives you time to study, eat, and get ready.

Watch out for homophones.,
Use apostrophes correctly:


it’s and its cause problems for many people.,
Be aware of noun and verb differences in words like:


advice/advise advice is the noun whereas advise is the verb
practice/practice practice is the noun and practice is the verb (in British English)
affect/effect - affect is a verb , effect is a noun.,
Watch out for words that look similar:


dose/does
of/off
quiet/quite
chose/choose
lose/loose
accept/except

,
Take care not to write ‘of’ instead of ‘have’ after modal verbs such as would, could, should, must, may and might.",How to Avoid Common Spelling Mistakes when Writing a wikiHow Article," These are words which sound the same, but are spelled differently: commonly confused on wikiHow are:


allowed/aloud - allowed means permitted, whereas aloud has the same meaning as out loud
bored/board - bored means to have lost interest; a board is a flat piece of wood
break/brake - break means to damage, but brake is what you do to slow down a car or a bicycle
new/knew - new is the opposite of old whereas knew is the past tense of to know
past/passed - past is earlier in time; passed can mean that you did not fail a class or that you went by someone
piece/peace - a piece is a part of something (it even has the word pie as its first three letters!); peace on the other hand means absence of noise or hostility
sure/shore - sure means certain, but shore means the beach or coastline
site/sight - site is the correct spelling when you mean the place where something sits - like a website! Sight on the other hand means something you can see.
stairs/stares - stairs are steps; stares is a verb meaning to gaze intently
steel/steal - steel is a metal, whereas steal means to take something that does not belong to you
they're/their/there They're is a shorter way to say they are. Their is possessive - it's their fault. There is a place - over there.
through/threw - through is a direction (as in straight through the door), but threw is the past tense of throw
to/too/two - Two naughty boys who went too far went to jail.
whether/weather - whether indicates a choice - whether or not, whereas weather means sun. rain, snow etc.
which/witch - Which witch is the wicked witch? (apologies to all witch's!)
whole/hole - whole means complete whereas hole means a gap or space where something is missing
right/write - right means correct or the opposite of left, but write means to compose (words or music)
your/you're - your is a possessive pronoun, and you're is a contraction, as in saying ""You're really good at writing articles.""

, it’s means ‘it is’ whereas its is the possessive form. Possessive pronouns his, hers and its are the only possessive forms which do NOT have an apostrophe - hence the confusion. The dog wagged its tail.

Other than that, use an apostrophe where one or two letters have been missed out when a word has been contracted - eg. where is becomes where's. Plurals do NOT need an apostrophe.
Plural possessives have the apostrophes after the s. The dogs' tails wagged in excitement.

, So you talk about the effect of something, but affecting someone. Another easy way to remember this is affect = affection while effect = cause and effect.

,, The confusion comes from the contraction - would have becomes would've which sounds like ‘would of’.

""There"", ""their"" and ""they're"" all sound alike, but each one means something different from the others.,
""Two"", ""to"" and ""too"" are also three different words that sound alike.,
Here's the hardest one: Which ""its"" gets an apostrophe?,
""Write""/ ""right"" and ""tried""/""tired"" are two more pairs of words that sound the same but have different spellings for different meanings.,
Dictionaries are valuable things: Invest in one!",How to Avoid Common Spelling Mistakes," These three words are a good place to start.


""There"" indicates a place. Tips: You can tell because it contains the word ""here"" that is another place. Here and there is a pair of words that indicate places. ""There"" means that something is in a certain area.
""Their"" means ""something that belongs to them"". Tips: It contains ""heir"". An heir is someone who has inherited something, so An heir is someone who owns something. 'T' plus 'heir' equals their. ""Their"" is a possessive pronoun.
""They're"" means ""they are"". In fact, it is just a compound version of the two-word phrase. The apostrophe (') shows that a letter (the letter being ""a"" in ""they're"") has been removed and replaced by the apostrophe.

,


First is ""to"". It usually indicates going somewhere, so ""go"" and ""to"" each have just one ""o"" and one different letter. ""To"" is used as a preposition and infinitive phrase conjunction.
""Too"" means an excessive amount of something, such as ""It's too hard to learn all the rules of English spelling."" Tips: You can tell it's the right ""too"" for this job, because it has too many ""o's"" in it. The ""to"" with the extra ""o"" means ""excessive"".
""Two"" is the number 2.There isn't really a way to help you remember why the ""w"" is in there, except that you can always think ""Why am I spelling this Word out instead of just using the numeral?"" When you are writing an essay or legal paperwork, spell out ""two"" unless they tell you to do specifically. However, when you are writing elsewhere, you can use two.

, By the standard rules of English, ""its"" is a possessive pronoun. ""It's"" is a contraction, meaning that it means ""it is"". Do not use ""it's"" like this: It's dog has gone."" This translates into: ""It is dog has gone.""


When the word is supposed to mean ""it is"", but you want to write ""it's"", use the apostrophe. When something belongs to ""it"", leave the apostrophe out. Using ""its"" and ""it's"" properly will make your writing look smarter and help to maintain people's attention better.

, These are homophones.


""Write"" means to inscribe or pencil in, or to write with a pencil. ""Right"" mean correct, and can also be the opposite of left.
""Tried"" means to have made an effort, and ""tired"" means being exhausted or fatigued.
Also, ""loose"" means the opposite of tight, and ""lose"" is the opposite of win and the opposite of found.
""One"" is the number 1 and ""won"" is the opposite of lost, meaning victory.

, Happy spelling!

Edit your cheat sheet.,
Pretend you don’t have a cheat sheet.,
Keep your cheat sheet.",How to Write Notes for a Math Test," You should get into the practice of adding to them every day during and after class. This way, you can write down specific things the instructor focused on. These skills, topics, and examples are more likely to be included on the test.For more information on how to take good math notes, read Take Perfect Math Notes.
If you wait until just before the test to take notes, you will likely be overwhelmed with information in the textbook and online, and you will waste a lot of time and energy.
Label notes clearly, with a date, unit, and/or chapter heading. It might also be helpful to clearly mark in your notes when exams are. This will help you remember what material might be on an upcoming test, and which material was associated with a previous test.;
, A few days before the test, look back over what you’ve written throughout the course, or since the last test. Be aware of skills and concepts you are confident about, and which you aren’t. Don’t worry about including information you know well on your cheat sheet.


Don’t think of this as “refreshing your memory.” If you need to “refresh your memory” about a concept, then you probably don’t know it very well.

, This usually includes formulas, vocabulary, rules, theorems, and other things you need to learn through rote memory.

, Determine which formulas, rules, etc., appear frequently in assignments. You can even make a chart and tally each time you use a particular formula or theorem. The ones that appear the most frequently are the ones more likely to appear on a test, and the ones you should therefore memorize. Since math is sequential, these are probably formulas you will need to know for the rest of the course, not just for the upcoming test., Rewriting your course notes is usually not helpful, because if you do not understand something, simply writing it over and over again will not lead to understanding. By rewriting your notes using different words and examples, you can help ensure that you truly understand the concepts behind the notes.


Make sure you do this well before the test, so that you can still get help from your instructor if you need to.
Use your class notes, textbook, assignments, practice tests, and online resources to help you paraphrase concepts in a way that you can understand.

, You might understand a skill in isolation, but not how it fits in with the overall concepts. Often you will learn skills and formulas first, and then use them later on for various concepts. Simply organizing your cheat sheet in the same order that you took notes will not necessarily help you understand how all the information fits together.To reorganize your notes, it is helpful to use graphic organizers, such as lists or mind maps.You can also use Venn diagrams, flow charts, or T-charts.
While reorganizing concepts, include any formulas, vocabulary, or rules associated with them in your graphic organizer.

, When you begin to create your cheat sheet, start by listing everything you remember about the test concepts. Then, go back and compare this list with your notes. Things that you forgot, or that you remembered incorrectly, should go into your cheat sheet., You might be tempted to write down things you already know on your cheat sheet, because you’re worried you’ll draw a blank during your test. Try to avoid this temptation, and be confident in your abilities. You have limited space, so you want to reserve your cheat sheet for things you have difficulty remembering.

, Think of how you can organize the information. Use each major concept that will be covered on the test as a heading. Use bullet points, colors, and your graphic organizers to help present the information in a way that you can access quickly and easily., You can hand write or type your cheat sheet, depending on how you can better present the information. Writing by hand may make it easier to incorporate graphic features, and to cram more information into tighter spaces in the page.However, you don’t want to write so small that your notes are difficult to read, or to cram in so much information that your notes are difficult to follow.


One advantage of creating your cheat sheet by hand instead of by computer is that writing by hand helps you synthesize and understand topics better., Some people like to use their computer to shrink down their notes, so that they can print four pages of notes on one standard sheet. You should first check with your instructor to make sure that this technique is acceptable. Some teachers might view this as actually cheating, and will take your notes away from you during the test.


If you feel you need to include so much information on your cheat sheet that you have to use a computer to shrink down your notes, that probably means you didn’t prepare well enough for your test.

, If possible, take a practice test using your cheat sheet. This will help you get used to using your sheet.

, After you take a practice test, edit your cheat sheet based on how you used it on the practice exam.


You might notice that there were things missing from your sheet.
You might learn that things you thought you needed to include on the sheet were unimportant, or that you remembered things on your own. You can remove these from your sheet to free up space for more important concepts., While taking the test, don’t use the cheat sheet as a crutch. Go through the test without the cheat sheet first, completing everything you can without it. Then go through the test a second time, using your sheet to help you complete those problems you struggled with.


Put your cheat sheet under your test or under your desk, so you aren’t tempted to waste time looking at it when you don’t need to.

, You can use your cheat sheets to help you prepare for final exams.Review your sheet after you get back your graded test, so that you can see how it did and did not help you. Then make revisions as needed.

You have to hit the equals (=) sign to complete a calculation using these symbols.

Use these functions the same way you would on a basic calculator. For example, to find 12/4, enter 12÷4={\displaystyle 12\div 4=}.
;
, A scientific calculator will automatically calculate using the correct order.

For example, if your problem is 2 - 4 × -3 ÷ 2, you can type 2−4×−3÷2={\displaystyle 2-4\times -3\div 2=}, and the calculator will automatically do the order of operations for you.


, This will override the calculator’s order of operations.

Hit the beginning parentheses before you hit your first number, and hit the ending parentheses after you hit your last number. The calculator will complete that calculation before you enter your next functions. 

If you need, you can also nest parentheses, though be sure that you can keep track of them.


, If you accidentally hit a wrong key, hit the DEL{\displaystyle {\mathrm {DEL} }} button. This will clear the last button you pressed, but will not clear any calculations you’ve made.
, To clear the line, hit the CLEAR{\displaystyle {\mathrm {CLEAR} }} button. Chances are, you can scroll up to see past calculations. You can hit delete with each line in order to get rid of these.
, To use some functions, you might have to use the 2nd{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }} key. These functions are listed above the button, similar to how symbols are listed above the number keys on a keyboard. To use these functions, hit the 2nd key first. Getting the syntax right for some operations may involve switching the order between the operation and the number.

For the TI-30X IIS, one of the 2nd functions is to turn off the calculator. Simply press 2nd ON{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {ON} }}.


, While there are buttons to do this, fractions are much easier to type in manually. The reason is that most scientific calculators only output in decimal format.

For example, to evaluate 4/5 + 6/7, type in 4÷5+6÷7={\displaystyle 4\div 5+6\div 7=} to get approximately 1.657. Use parentheses for more complex operations. 

To convert back to fractions, use 2nd PRB{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {PRB} }} to get the answer in mixed fractions.


, Do this using the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} button. Type in the number you want to square, then hit the that button.

For example, to square the number 12, type 12 x2={\displaystyle 12\ x^{2}=}.

To find powers of any number, use the ∧{\displaystyle \wedge } key. For example, type 3∧5={\displaystyle 3\wedge 5=} to get 243.


, Type 2nd x2{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ x^{2}} to display the square root.

To find the square root of 9, type 2nd x2 9={\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ x^{2}\ 9=}.


, There are two buttons for logarithms. The LOG{\displaystyle {\mathrm {LOG} }} is the logarithm base 10. Use whichever one is appropriate.

For example, to find the logarithm base 10 of 100, simply type LOG 100={\displaystyle {\mathrm {LOG} }\ 100=}.


, The exponential function ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} is found by typing 2nd LN{\displaystyle {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {LN} }}. If you need to use Euler's number only, use e to the first power.

For example, to find the natural log of e, type in LN 2nd LN 1={\displaystyle {\mathrm {LN} }\ {\mathrm {2nd} }\ {\mathrm {LN} }\ 1=}.


, Sine, cosine, and tangent come standard with any scientific calculator. To use these buttons, be sure that you know whether to use degrees or radians. To convert, use the DRG{\displaystyle {\mathrm {DRG} }} button to highlight DEG or RAD. Other calculators will generally have a button that converts between these two systems.

For example, if you wanted to find the sine of 60 degrees, make sure that you are in degree mode by checking the lower right of the display. Then, type SIN 60={\displaystyle {\mathrm {SIN} }\ 60=}.


, Do this using the x−1{\displaystyle x^{-1}} button. On some calculators, it may be labeled as 1/x{\displaystyle 1/x} instead. Type in the number you want to find the reciprocal of, then hit the reciprocal button.

For example, to find the reciprocal of 3, type 3 x−1={\displaystyle 3\ x^{-1}=}.

Understand that mathematics consists of a broad range of topics and is not a single subject.,
Begin with arithmetic.,
Be aware that arithmetic is everyday math.,
Learn about algebra.,
Proceed to geometry.,
Become familiar with trigonometry.,
Learn calculus.,
Understand the field of probability.,
Learn statistics.",How to Understand the Different Areas of Mathematics," The following steps detail the different areas with which you will need to become familiar as you are studying mathematics.;
, Arithmetic is the first branch of mathematics that you will have studied in elementary and middle school. It deals with the study of numbers and the use of the four fundamental processes:


Addition






Subtraction






Multiplication






Division







, It is important to get a solid grounding in this aspect of mathematics because you use it in your personal affairs, and arithmetic is the basis for most other mathematics.

, Algebra is used widely to solve problems in business, industry, and science by using symbols, such as x and y, to represent unknown values. The power of algebra is that it enables us to create, write, and rewrite problem–solving formulas. Without algebra, we would not have many of the items we use on a daily basis, for example, television, radio, telephone, microwave oven, etc.

, Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with shapes. More specifically, geometry is the study of relations, properties, and measurements of solids, surfaces, lines, and angles. It is most useful in building or measuring things. Architects, astronomers, construction engineers, navigators, and surveyors are just a few professionals who rely on geometry.

, Trigonometry is mathematics that deals with triangular measurements. Plane trigonometry computes the relationships between the sides of triangles on level surfaces called planes. Spherical trigonometry studies the triangles on the surface of a sphere.

, Calculus is high-level mathematics dealing with rates of change. It has many practical applications in engineering, physics, and other branches of science. Using calculus, we understand and explain how water flows, the sun shines, the wind blows, and the planets cycle through the heavens. Differential calculus deals with the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another, for example the rate at which an object’s speed changes with respect to time. Integral calculus deals with adding up the effects of continuously changing quantities, for example, computing the distance covered by an object when its speeds over a time interval are known.

, Probability is the study of the likelihood of an event’s occurrence. It is useful in predicting the outcomes of future events. Probability originated from the study of games of chance. It is now used for other purposes, including (1) controlling of the flow of traffic through a highway system; (2) predicting the number of accidents people of various ages will have; (3) estimating the spread of rumors; (4) predicting the outcome of electronics; and (5) predicting the rate of return in risky investments.

, Statistics is the branch of mathematics that helps mathematicians organize and find meaning in data. Anyone who listens to the radio, watches television, and reads books, newspapers, and magazines cannot help but be aware of statistics, which is the science of collecting, analyzing, presenting and interpreting data. Statistics appear in the claims of advertisers, in cost-of-living indexes, and in reports of business trends and cycles.

Use objects to count out the math visually.,
Practice your addition and subtraction tables.,
Start by adding the final digits of both numbers together.,
Play games with simple math.",How to Understand Math1," Take a bag of marbles and use these to visually see how addition works. For example, take five marbles out of the bag. Now take another three marbles out of the bag. Combine all the marbles together and count how many you have. You’ll have eight marbles. That means that five plus three equals eight. Using this tactic can help you visual subtraction too. Try taking four marbles away from your pile of eight marbles. You’ll end up with four marbles left. That means that eight minus four equals four.;
, You can buy workbooks online or visit free websites that allow you to practice. You’ll be presented with a table filled with all sorts of problems to solve – everything from one plus one to seventeen plus fifteen and so on. , If you are adding numbers that have multiple digits you can set them up on top of each other to make it easier to add. Consider the problem 21 plus 14. Draw the equation so that the 21 is sitting on top of the 14. Now draw a line underneath the 14. Adding down, add the final two numbers. In this case, those numbers would be the ‘1’ from 21 and the ‘4’ from 14. One plus four equals five, so you would write a five below the line you made under those two numbers. Now add the ‘2’ from 21 and the ‘1’ from 14. Two plus one equals three. Write the three under those two numbers to the left of the five that you just wrote. You should have the numbers 3 and 5 sittings next to each other below the line you drew. That means the answer to this problem is 35. 14 + 21 = 35.
If you add two numbers together and they make another two digit number, take the one from that two digit number and move it over to the left. For example, if the problem was 14 + 28 instead your first calculation would be 8 + 4. This would give you 12. You would still put the ‘2’ from 12 below the line underneath the 4 and the 8. However, the ‘1’ from 12 would then be moved over to the left and added to the second equation. So you would add the ‘1’ from 14, the ‘2’ from 28 and the ‘1’ from 12. That would give you the number 4 once you add all those numbers together. This means that 14 + 28 must equal 42.

, Pass the pigs is a popular game that has you roll tiny ceramic pigs on a table. Based on the way that they land, you earn a certain amount of points. You only play to 100 so the numbers never get too high, but it’s a great way to learn basic addition. It’s much better than doing addition tables for hours!

Understand the concept of multiplication and division.,
Learn the properties of multiplication.,
Practice your multiplication and division tables.",How to Understand Math2," The idea behind multiplication is to shortcut adding the same things over and over again. You use multiplication when you have groups of the same size. For example, maybe you have three cups of water that you drank ten times. How many cups of water did you drink total? You could solve this problem by counting adding the amount of times you drank the water from each cup together, or you could clump them into groups to multiply. The idea behind division is splitting equal parts into groups. If you have a pizza with eight slices and four friends, how should you split it up so that each person gets an equal amount of the pizza? In division, that problem would be written as eight divided by four. Each person gets two pieces of pizza.

, For example, order doesn’t matter when you multiply. That’s one of the properties that you should learn if you want to learn multiplication. You also should learn multiplication problems that change the order of factors, which is called commutativity, problems that change the grouping of factors, which is called associativity., Becoming familiars of the rules to each number will be a huge help when dividing and multiplying. For example, when you multiple numbers by five the answer will always end in a five or a zero. If you multiply a number by two, it will always end in an even number. Similar rules apply for division. Learn these rules and practice your tables. "

Pay attention in class.,
Take notes.,
Study.,
Answer questions and ask questions in class.,
Do your homework.",How to Understand Math3," You'll never learn mathematics if you don't know the basics. Make sure you pay particular attention at the start of each new unit as things are explained. Math is generally taught as a series of building blocks and if you miss a block it could be very difficult to catch up.

, If you take notes in class you'll be able to look back on what you did in class that day. When you go to do your homework you’ll be able to refer back to the examples that you wrote down from class. Writing as you learn also helps you learn and remember better. , Studying before the test is always going to be necessary, but there’s nothing wrong with taking fifteen or twenty minutes every night to study the lesson that you learned that day. You’ll find that you feel much more prepared for the following day of class and you will do less cramming the day before the test.

, It doesn't matter if you get the answer wrong, at least you tried and don't feel ashamed by asking questions. How do you know you might ask somebody else's question, they might be thankful and probably help you out on bits you don't understand.

, Working on math everyday is the real key to understanding it. The more time you spend around the number and concepts the more comfortable you will be with them. Homework might seem like a drag but the daily repetition will really help you. "

Go for extra help.,
Practice more on your own.,
Hire a tutor.,
Look to a friend or peer for guidance.",How to Understand Math4," Almost any teacher will go to extra help. Don’t be too proud to ask – you’ll develop a relationship with your teacher and it will help a lot. Your teacher will appreciate that you came in looking for more help and the teacher will know what you need to work on in the future. This is highly recommended.

, You have to be honest with yourself here. Is the issue that you aren’t trying hard enough, or that you really just don’t understand math? If you’re not trying hard enough, you need to work harder to practice on your own. There’s no way to understand math if you aren’t willing to put in the work. However, if you have been practicing on your own and you just can’t wrap your head around a certain subject, then it’s perfectly logical to ask for help.

, If you’re willing to spend money, hiring a professional tutor can be a huge help when it comes to understanding a subject. Professional tutors are often very expensive, but if you hire an older student the price might come down. Tutors will sit down with you one on one and work you through your problems.

, If you don’t want to hire a tutor or go to extra help another good option is to ask a peer. There is bound to be someone in the math class who understands the concepts well. Find this person and develop a relationship with them. Ask them if they would be willing to sit down with you over lunch and help you with a couple of topics you are struggling with. Don’t take advantage of them and never try to copy their answers – just use them as a resource. There’s no reason to be too proud to ask for help. That’s a good skill to develop in life.

Strive for understanding rather than memorization.,
Use mathematics in everyday life.,
Focus on specific topics.,
Buy a practice book.,
Test yourself.,
Stay committed.",How to Understand Math5," Memorizing formulas and tables is all well and good, but it is more important to understand why the answers are what they are. Try to figure out the logic behind the problem rather than just memorizing and regurgitating. , When you're getting the change in the supermarket calculate how much money you should get back. If you are buying gas at a gas station, try to multiply the price by the amount of gallons it takes to fill your tank. Getting better at mental math is a great way to feel more confident, even if the subjects you are studying in school are much more complex. You will always be using addition, subtraction, and multiplication in one way or another no matter how complicated the subject gets.

, Math is a broad field. Unless you devote your life to the studying of mathematics it is unlikely that you’ll ever understand everything. Figure out what part of math is most important for you to understand. Maybe it’s something you’re studying in school or a subject you have a personal interest in. Start with the basics and work your way up. Don’t start trying to do algebra if you aren’t comfortable with your multiplication tables yet.

, You can find practice books on the Internet or in bookstores for any math topic imaginable. These practice books will have a guided curriculum to help you get better at math.

, Testing yourself is a great way to figure out for sure what you understand and what you don’t understand. You might think you understand a concept but you won’t really know for sure until you test yourself. Most textbooks feature practice questions and tests. , Like anything else, being good at math takes a lot of practice. You wouldn’t expect to be muscular after doing twenty pushups at the gym, so you shouldn’t expect to be good at math after doing twenty practice problems. Practice everyday and you’ll start to understand math more and more.

Learn about fractions and ratios.,
Learn how to divide fractions.,
Learn how to use variables.",How to Survive Sixth Grade Math1," A ratio is a way to compare numbers.In sixth grade you will start working more with fractions and calculating ratios.A fraction is a type of ratio called “part-to-whole.” The numerator tells you the number of parts you have, the denominator tells you the number of parts in the whole. So, if you have 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} of a pizza, you have 3 parts (probably slices), and the entire pizza is made of 4 parts, or slices.

The other type of ratio is called “part-to-part.” This type of ratio tells you how many parts of a whole one group is, compared with how many parts another group is. For example, the ratio of girls to boys in a classroom might be 2:1. This means that for every 2 girls in the classroom, there is 1 boy.

Learn more about ratios by reading these articles:


Calculate Ratios


Make a Ratio


Simplify a Ratio


;
, You will begin dividing fractions in sixth grade, which includes dividing fractions by whole numbers, and fractions by fractions.To  divide by a fraction, you take the reciprocal of one of the numbers and multiply.

A reciprocal is found by “flipping” a fraction: the numerator becomes the denominator, and the denominator becomes the numerator.For example, the reciprocal of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} is 43{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{3}}}.

As an example, to divide 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} by 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, take the reciprocal of 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} and multiply:34÷14{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}\div {\frac {1}{4}}}34×41{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}\times {\frac {4}{1}}}=3×44×1{\displaystyle ={\frac {3\times 4}{4\times 1}}}=124{\displaystyle ={\frac {12}{4}}}=3{\displaystyle =3}


, In sixth grade you will begin learning basic algebra skills involving variables.A variable is a letter that stands for an unknown value in a math equation.You will need to understand what variables mean, as well as how to  solve for them.

For example, the variable 4y{\displaystyle 4y} is equal to y+y+y+y{\displaystyle y+y+y+y}. It is also equal to 4×y{\displaystyle 4\times y} and 2×2×y{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times y}.

To solve the equation y+3=11{\displaystyle y+3=11}, you need to find the value of y{\displaystyle y}. To find the value of y{\displaystyle y}, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:y+3=11{\displaystyle y+3=11}y+3−3=11−3{\displaystyle y+3-3=11-3}y=8{\displaystyle y=8}

Keep a positive attitude.,
Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.,
Practice and learn through games.,
Study with friends.",How to Survive Sixth Grade Math2," A negative attitude towards math can hurt your ability to perform well.So, it is important to be optimistic about math and your abilities. Just because you performed poorly in the past does not mean you can’t improve in the future and be successful.
, Math ability is not a talent you are born with. Math skills are something you have to learn and practice to do well. It is natural to make mistakes, and in fact, mistakes help us learn and do better. If you avoid math work because you are afraid of looking stupid and making mistakes, you will likely not fulfill your potential., Math practice can be boring, so make it fun by practicing while playing games. Just make sure you are also completing your regular classwork.

Take advantage of math games, programs, and apps you use at school, such as iReady, IXL, or STMath. When your teacher gives you time to use the computer to practice math, make sure you stay on task. 

You can use free computer time to go on math game websites. Some popular ones include Cool Mathand Math Playground.Play games that relate to the current topics you are learning in math. Your teacher may be able to pick out appropriate games for you to play.  

According to one study, the majority of men pursuing a career in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) became interested in the subject through games and toys they played when they were younger. , Learning is always more fun with friends, as long as you stay on task. Study partners can also help you with missed work from absences, as well as preparing for tests.Study groups can help you improve in a number of ways. You can share notes and learn from each other, since some members of the group may be better at certain skills than others.Pick a weekly day and time for studying with your study group. Study in a comfortable place, like someone’s house or a library. Make sure, though, that you don’t study in a place with a lot of distractions.

To make sure your study sessions are effective, have goals for each session, and come prepared with your notes, work, and textbooks."
"
Take notes.,
Use a planner.,
Keep a neat desk and locker.",How to Survive Sixth Grade Math3," By taking notes in class and reviewing those notes, you are doing yourself a favor. Note taking is a sure way to improve your math performance.Just make sure your notes are consistent. If you miss a day, ask one of your study partners for their notes.

Don’t be lazy! If your teacher tells you to write something down, or says that something is important or will be on a test, write it down.

Write down formulas, terms, and definitions.

Don’t try to write down everything, or else your notes will not be helpful. Just write down what you think seems important. You might also miss out on important information your teacher is giving while you are trying to keep up.

Keep your notes organized. At the beginning of each class, write down the date, unit, and topic you are learning about. Try to use bullet points when you are taking your notes.

If your notes are messy, it is worth recopying them each day. Make sure your handwriting is neat, so you can read your notes later. You can also reorganize the notes so that they are easier to follow.


, Your school might have given you a planner or agenda at the beginning of the year. Use it! If they didn’t give you a planner, you can buy one, or make your own out of a plain notebook. Write down your math homework each day. Write down the dates of projects, quizzes, and tests so you don’t forget to study or turn in your work. You can also write down the dates and times that your math study group meets.

Review your planner each weekend, so you know what is coming up.


, Make sure you use your notebooks, folders, and binders. Don’t just shove your work in your desk, locker, or bookbag. Many students get poor grades in math simply because they lose their work and don’t turn it in.

Take the time to put your math work in your math folder. If you put it in a different folder, you will likely forget where it is.

Keep your folder neat. Keep graded work in the right pocket, and work you need to turn in or complete in the left pocket.

Ask questions in class.,
Understand what the assignments are.,
Complete all assignments.,
Review returned work.",How to Survive Sixth Grade Math4," If you don’t understand something your teacher is saying, raise your hand and ask questions. Don’t worry about looking dumb. The odds are that if you are confused about something, other people are confused, too.Even if you are the only one who is confused, having others thinking you are dumb is not worth the risk of not learning. Not asking questions about something you don’t understand is a sure way to keep misunderstanding.

Since math topics build upon one another, if you don’t master skills taught today, you likely won’t master skills taught tomorrow, either. So it is important to ask questions right away. 


, Before you leave class, make sure you understand what is expected of you. Look at your textbook and ensure that the assignment you wrote down matches what is in the book. If your teacher is grading with a rubric, make sure you look at the rubric before you begin your assignment. If you have questions about the rubric, ask your teacher.
, The surest way to survive math class is to complete all of your assignments. Even if you don’t understand the math involved, make an effort to try. Teachers usually give full or partial credit if you complete all the requirements of the assignment and show your work. If you don’t turn in your work at all, you will get no credit for your assignment.

It is very hard to raise your grade once you receive a few zeros on assignments. Even though a D isn’t a passing grade, it is much easier to recover from.

For example, if you have two assignments, and you earn a 0% on the first assignment because you didn’t complete it, and a 100% on the second assignment, your average grade is only 50%, which is an F. On the other hand, if you have a 60% (D) on your first assignment, and a 100% on your second assignment, your average grade is 80%, which is a B.




, Determine why your answers were marked incorrect. Was it because you didn’t show your work or made a minor calculating error? Or was it because you didn’t understand how to do the problem? If you made careless mistakes, take care to work more slowly next time. If you made mistakes because you did not fully understand the math concepts, speak to your teacher about getting more help.

Find a tutor.",How to Survive Sixth Grade Math5," Teachers are very busy, but sometimes they are able to provide extra help before or after school, especially if you are struggling with a particular math topic. Even if you need ongoing help, you should talk to your teacher, as she or he might be able to help you by providing you with more practice work, or by suggesting groups, teachers, or tutors you can go to for help.
, There are a number of resources online that can help you master just about any math topic. These resources take the form of tutorials, videos, and forums.

Some helpful tutorial sites include Math is Funand Purplemath.Some video resources include Khan Academyand Virtual Nerd.Some popular forums include The Math Forumand My Math Forum., A tutor will give you one-on-one help. You can also work at your own pace, and only focus on the topics you struggle with. Unlike in a classroom environment, a tutor will give you immediate feedback so you can correct mistakes and misconceptions as you make them.

Talk to your parents about using a tutoring center, such as Sylvan, Huntington, or a local tutoring center.

Look for tutoring services through your school, or through clubs, like the Boys and Girls Club or YMCA.

You can also find a tutor online. Some tutors are local and will work with you in person, but you can also find a tutor who will work with you virtually over the Internet. Some popular online tutoring services include WyzAntand Varsity Tutors."

Formulate your research question.,
Check to see if the following assumptions are met:Simple random sampling is used.,
State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.,
Set an appropriate significance level (alpha).,
Calculate the test statistic, z.,
Convert the test statistic to a p value.,
Decide between null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis.,
State a conclusion about the research question.",How to Perform Hypothesis Testing for a Proportion," Hypothesis testing for a proportion is appropriate for comparing proportions of a sample to a hypothesized population parameter.Examples of questions that can be answered using hypothesis testing for a proportion:

Are there more than 50 percent of Americans who self-identify as liberal?
Is the percentage of defects in a given manufacturing plant more than 5%?
Is the proportion of babies born male different from 50 percent?


Examples of questions that should be answered using another test:

Are there more Americans who self-identify as liberal than as conservative? (Use hypothesis testing for 2 proportions instead.)
Is the mean number of defects in a given manufacturing plant more than 50 per month? (Use hypothesis testing for one sample t-test instead.)
Are male births related to paternal age? (Use chi-square test for independence instead.)

;
,
Each sample point can result in only one of two possible outcomes. These outcomes are called successes and failures.
The sample includes at least 10 successes and 10 failures.
The population size is at least 20 times as big as the sample size.

, The null hypothesis (H0) always contains an equality, and is the one you are trying to refute. The alternative (research) hypothesis never contains an equality, and is the one you are trying to confirm. These two hypotheses are stated so that they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Mutually exclusive means that if one is true, the other must be false, and vice versa. Collectively exhaustive means that at least one of the outcomes must occur. Your hypotheses are formulated depending on whether it is right-tailed, left-tailed, or 2-tailed:


Right-tailed: Research question: Is the sample proportion greater than the hypothesized population proportion? Your hypotheses would be stated as follows: H0: p<=p0; Ha: p>p0.
Left-tailed: Research question: Is the sample proportion less than the hypothesized population proportion? Your hypotheses would be stated as follows: H0: p>=p0; Ha: p<p0.
Two-tailed: Research question: Is the sample proportion different from the hypothesized population proportion? Your hypotheses would be stated as follows: H0: p=p0; Ha: p<>p0.
In your example, you can use a two-tailed test to see if the sample proportion of male births, 0.53, is different from the hypothesized population proportion of 0.50. So H0: p=0.50; Ha: p<>0.50. Typically, if there is no a priori reason to believe that any differences must be unidirectional, the two-tailed test is preferred as it is a more stringent test.

, By definition, the alpha level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.Most commonly, alpha is set at 0.05, although any other values (between 0 and 1, exclusive) can be used instead. Other commonly used alpha values include 0.01 and 0.10.

, The formula is z = (p - p0)/s, where s = standard deviation of the sampling distribution = sqrt(p0*(1-p0)/n).


In our example, p=0.53, p0=0.50, and n=1000. s = sqrt(0.50*(1-0.50)/1000) = 0.0158. the test statistic is z = (0.53-0.50)/0.0158 = 1.8974.

, p value is the probability that a randomly selected sample of n would have a sample statistic at least as different as the one obtained. p value is the tail area under the normal curve in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. For example, if a right-tailed test is used, p value is the right-tailed area, or area to the right of the z value. If a two-tailed test is used, p value is the area in both tails. p value can be found using one of several methods:


Normal distribution probability z table. Examples can be found on the web, such as this. It is important to read the table description to note what probability is listed by the table. Some tables list cumulative (left side) area, others list right tail area, still others list only area from mean up to a positive z value.
Excel. The excel function =norm.s.dist(z,cumulative). Substitute the numeric value for z and ""true"" for cumulative. This excel formula gives cumulative area to the left of a given z value. For your example, you would use the formula =norm.s.dist(1.8974,true) to find the cumulative left side area, which includes the left tail and the body. (Body is the area from -z to z.) You can subtract this from 1 to find the right tail area. Since your example is 2-tailed, you would then multiply by 2. A formula for p can be =2*(1-norm.s.dist(1.8974,true)). The output is 0.0578.
Texas Instrument calculator, such as TI-83 or TI-84.
Online normal distribution calculators.

, If p<alpha, reject H0. Otherwise, fail to reject H0. In your example, since p=0.0578 is greater than alpha=0.05, you fail to reject H0.

, For your example, you fail to reject the null hypothesis that the proportion of babies born male is 0.50. There is insufficient evidence to support the claim that the proportion of male birth is not 0.50.

Compare the critical t-value and the calculated t-statistic.,
Use the following example problem to practice the equations given above.

",How to Perform a Two Sample T Test,"


In general, the null hypothesis will state that the two populations being tested have no statistically significant difference.
The alternate hypothesis will state that there is one present.;
,


We will call this the alpha (α) level. The typical value is 0.05. This means that there is 95% confidence that the conclusion of this test will be valid.

,


These values will need to be distinct when using the equation.

,


These are equal to the two sample sizes, or the number of data points in each population.

,


We will call this the k value. On the t-distribution table below, this value is referred to as df.
To calculate this value, add both of the n values together and subtract 2.

,


We will call these x̄1 and x̄2.
This is calculated by adding all of the data points in each sample set together, then dividing by the number of data points in the set (the corresponding n value).

,


We will call these the S-values.
This is a number that describes how much the data varies inside its own sample set. Use the following formula.

,,,


If the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value, the test concludes that there is a statistically significant difference between the two populations.

Therefore, you reject the null hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between the two populations.


In any other case, there is no statistically significant difference between the two populations.

The test fails to reject the null hypothesis.

",How to Study Math," Don't just use the facts of math. Learn them deeply (both backward and forward, where possible and logical). That means do not be lazy, such as counting on your fingers. Memorize the rules and facts of math at your level. (So for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division tables, forms and formulas, know them instantly, not working them out each time.) Not bothering to really absorb/learn such facts, applications and meanings properly will make more advanced math difficult or impossible, until you go back and learn the basics.;
, Accept the math. ""Agree with math. Love it."" Math is very much like a new language, at times. So, you have to study it as a special kind of language and make sure it becomes part of your basic language, like common words. Study examples in your math text. Have your teacher explain any words or concepts you don't understand. Give them time to become clear. Even if your current teacher doesn't use the terminology often, you can be certain that other teachers will in other math courses.


You probably know that a number can be Squared or used in a Square Root, Cubed or Cube Root. Numbers can be expressed as algebraic ""Terms"" (oddly, that use of ""term"" means numbers that are added, or subtracted). Numbers can be Factored, expressed as Factors. Knowing the definitions, postulates, and theorems involving such terms will make solving and understanding many problems possible. Learn the concepts and words ""deeply"" when they come up in your course. Don't just wait for them to go away and hope you won't see them again. You probably will, year after year.

Eventually, you may need to use ""factors"" in the process called ""Factorial"" where the ""!"", the exclamation sign, is read as ""factorial"". So n!, or like 4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24 by multiplying which means ""4 factorial"" is 24. So 5x4! is 5x24=120; so that means 5!=120, you see? This is used in statistics, for finding the number of ""combinations"" of things. One kind of combining is called ""permutations"" into different sequences or orders, etc.



, This may seem like extra work, but it will be an advantage.


Work some of the problems (odd and even) from your textbook before they are assigned.
Some teachers always assign the even questions, if those answer are not in the back of the book, so the students can't just write the answers. Some teachers always assign some numbered odd questions, so the students can check their own work -- since the odd numbers are answered/solved in the back of many texts. Some teachers assign one set of problems for homework, and use some of the others for tests!

Ask the teacher for help for any problems troubling you, even problems that were not assigned. Remember, you are trying to learn. Problems that are unassigned often end up on tests. And the extra difficult problems give you a chance to earn extra credit.
When the teacher discusses the subject (probably before assigning the problems), ask questions that may occur to you (because of the work you have already done.) This is the most useful aspect of doing the work early: All of the other students are thinking, ""Huh?"" while you are thinking about a specific question you need answered.
Some college mathematical professors teach their classes entirely by answering questions from the students. The students are expected to come to class having completed some of the work.
Another benefit of completing work early (including extra work) is that if you need to turn something in late, your teacher will know that you are not trying to take advantage of his/her goodwill and will ""give you a break"".

, Decide what the problem really means and what kinds of operation(s) and steps will be needed. Don't just start adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing or other operations without deciding what is needed.

,, Sometimes the more difficult problems will involve the example plus other things you should already know from previous sections or chapters.

, Identify your errors early. Finding an error after finishing may seem discouraging. Still, discovering your own errors is the best way not to repeat them.

, Don't just go on in your course or book without continuing to learn the material thoroughly, completely. Math builds upon itself.


A math course or book is like a novel, because it doesn't make sense unless you start at the beginning.

, Endeavor to make all of your writing, numbers and symbols look the same way every time. The more complex the math, the more neatness counts.

, Be deep. When one person in the group has a problem, others can help. But, don't depend on others too much. Do your in-depth studying and thinking...

, Avoid writing your ""5 or 8"" like a “6"" or ""3”. Do them clearly. For Algebra, write letter ""l"" (such as l for length) in a cursive form, to prevent confusion with 1 or i. Also, many people write z and 7 with a line in the middle, like ""Ƶ"" to avoid confusion with ""2"", or ""7"" to show it is not a ""1"" .


Leave time for checking. Speed requires practice and confidence, but leaving some time, about 5-10 minutes to check the paper is a good strategy. Your checking may spot obvious errors, like leaving out an entire question.



Think of psychology in scoring: If the question is worth 10 points, but your solution is very easy and short, something may have been done wrongly. Or if the question is worth only 1 point, but it took a long time to solve -- that may set off your alarm.


See if a final answer should be a “nice number“. If questions that are about whole objects, like the number of books, the answer should be a whole number, even if by rounding off. Then questions that require answers in 3 significant figures, may or may not have such “nice numbers”.



Try mathematical methods of verifying whether your answer seems ""reasonable"" or fit the kind of problem, to be sure of understandings:


Substitute back your final answer into the equations. For example, when solving ""simultaneous equations"" like x+y=3, x+2y=4, after getting the solution x=2, y=1, you should substitute back into the original two equations to check it. So, do x=2 and y=1 work for both equations. We substitute 2 for x and 1 for y. So then, x+y=3 gives us 2+1=3, true, and then x+2y=4 gives 2+2(1)=?; we get 2+2=4, true (here 2(1) is used to mean 2 times 1).

Substitute in nice possible values in an algebraic expression. For example, after finding your solution, you could substitute in a certain value for x, like x= 1, 2 or 10 or -1 or -2, etc. Then check whether both the left-hand (LHS) and right-hand sides (RHS) give the same value. (LHS=1/3, RHS=1/2-1/6=1/3). This indicates a high chance that your work is likely to be correct.

Check out the hourly forecast.,
See how much hype surrounds the storm.,
If you or your parents know an administrator in the school system, give them a call.,
Check the current closures of other public facilities in your area.,
See if nearby schools are also closed.,
Check your social networking sites.,
Use a snow day calculator.,
Consider how skilled your township is in snow removal.,
Consider how lenient your school board is about canceling school.,
Go to bed prepared for school the next day just in case.",How to Predict a Snow Day," Though you may think that you'll have a snow day for sure because it's snowing the evening before school, you've got to take the hourly forecast into account. If it says that it's going to stop snowing by 2 or 3 am, or even a bit later, then the snow plows may be able to remove the snow in time for the school buses to run. For the highest chances of a snow day, you want to see the heaviest snowfall between 5-7am.


However, it also doesn't hurt if the forecast says it'll start to snow heavily during school hours, because your school administrators will not want to deal with the mess of trying to get everyone safely home in the middle of a snowstorm.
Sometimes, you may also get an early dismissal, which is better than nothing.
You should also look for changes in the forecast. If it drastically changes and it looks like you'll be getting more snow than expected, then you're in a good place!
Also, consider how many inches of snow you will get. If it will be snowing all day but there will only be 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of precipitation, then you may still have to go to school.
Also consider if a winter weather advisory is in effect during school hours. Winter weather advisories are issued by the government when dangerous weather is expected. If the government considers the upcoming weather to be dangerous, chances are your school will too.
Also consider the possibility of ice. If rain is expected alongside freezing temperatures, you are likely to get some ice. This is good news because if the ice freezes onto the roads, transportation may not be as safe and therefore school is more likely to get cancelled.;
, Though this isn't as important as figuring out how much snow is expected to fall, if a storm has hype about it -- which means that you hear not only students, but also teachers, or even administrators, talking about it -- then it's more likely that you will have a snow day. This is because, if everyone is talking about it, administrators are more likely to see that the snow is a threat. Remember, the administrators don't want to let down the people who expect snow days, or to put them in dangerous situations.

, If your mom happens to be best friends with the school administrator/superintendent, or someone else who is high up on the school ladder, then you'll be more likely to hear about a snow day first. However, keep in mind that everyone will be hounding this person, and sometimes, these decisions aren't made until the middle of the night.


Some people also believe that if the bus drivers think that there will be a snow day tomorrow, then it may be more likely that school will be canceled.
If your parents know some teachers at your school, or if one of your friends happens to have teachers in the school as parents, then he or she may have some insight into whether or not you'll have a snow day earlier than the general public.
Also, some superintendents even communicate snow days over Twitter. Though you'll be called soon after the decision is made, you can have a leg up by checking out your administrator's Twitter page, if he or she has one.

, If there are events being cancelled or other schools already closing the night before in your area, then your chances are higher. If a school administrator sees that the surrounding schools or public places in your area are being closed down, then he or she will feel more pressure to do the same. This isn't a sure fire way to know what will happen, but it certainly won't hurt!

, If a school that is located just a few miles away is closed, your school will probably be closed too. If you know friends from other school districts, you can just ask them directly. If not, you can check out the local news and the local radio. Again, this doesn't make it 100% likely that you'll have a snow day yourself, but it does raise your chances.

, If you really feel clueless, check out your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts to see what people are saying about the oncoming snow. Even if you don't get an answer there, you may see that there's a lot of hype, which can increase the chances of the building storm! And if you can find a local teacher or administrator on Facebook or Twitter, they may have something to say about it.

, There are several online snow day calculators that have a good success rate in predicting whether or not there will be a snow day. All they need to know is your zip code, and they will consider the weather-related factors, as well as the likelihood that someone in your district will call for a snow day.If you are on a mobile device, you can also search the app store for ""snow day"" to see all the snow day prediction tools available.

, If you have a few inches of snow in Georgia, you may be more likely to have a snow day than you would if you lived in Maine, where the people in charge may be better prepared to deal with removing the snow, salting the roads, and maintaining order. If you have never seen a snowplow on your street, then those 2 inches (5.1 cm) of snow may really scare people off!

, Some districts and schools are much more trigger happy when it comes to making the decision to cancel school. If your school board has a good track record of canceling school when there has been a threat of snow, then you may be in good luck. On the other hand, if you've had to come to school while it's snowing and then walk home through the slush again and again, then you may be less likely to have a snow day. If your school is an urban district that largely walks, then you might not have a snow day, unless the snow becomes ice or the temperature is below zero. But if your district is a rural district with many busses that needs plowed roads, then you might have a higher chance of a snow day.

, This means having all your homework done and packed away as it normally would be, but it also means you must mentally expect there will be school the next day. Several snow day predictions have been wrong. You don't want to wake up to disappointment -- or panic because you haven't studied for your math test! If school is cancelled, then you are in for a surprise! It makes the fun even better. Even if it's not cancelled, you can do your research and be the first to know about the next big snowstorm to hit your town!


And hey, if you don't end up getting a snow day, it's not the end of the world. Public schools have a certain allotment of snow days for each year, and if you get too many snow days, you may have to come to school during holidays, or even to go to school late into the summer!

Use a symbol to denote the ratio.,
Write the first given quantity to the left of the symbol.,
Write the second given quantity to the right of the symbol.,
Simplify your ratio (optional).,
Turn the ratio into a percentage (optional).",How to Make a Ratio1," To indicate that you're using a ratio, you can use the division sign ( / ), a colon ( : ), or the word to. For example, if you wanted to say, ""For every five men at the party, there are three women,"" then you could use any of the three symbols to state this. Here's how you would do it:


5 men / 3 women
5 men : 3 women
5 men to 3 women;
, Write down the quantity of the first item before the symbol of your choice. You should also remember to state the units, or the number you're working with, whether it's men or women, chickens or goats, or miles or inches.


Example: 20 g of flour

, After you've written the first given quantity followed by the symbol, you should write the second given quantity, along with its units.


Example: 20 g of flour/ 8g of sugar

, You may want to simplify your ratio to do something like scale down a recipe. If you're using 20 g of flour for a recipe, then you know you'll need 8 g of sugar, and you're done. But if you'd like to scale down the ratio as much as possible, then you'll need to simplify it by writing the ratio in its lowest possible terms. You should use the same process as you would use to simplify a fraction. To do this, you have to find the GCF, or the greatest common factor, of both quantities, and then see how many times that number fits into each given quantity.


To find the GCF of 20 and 8, write down all of the factors of both numbers (the numbers that can multiply to make those numbers and thus can be evenly divided into those numbers) and find the largest number that is evenly divisible into both. Here's how you do it:

20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
8: 1, 2, 4, 8


4 is the GCF of 20 and 8 -- it's the largest number that evenly divides into both numbers. To get your simplified ratio, simply divide both numbers by 4:
20/4 = 5
8/4 = 2

Your new ratio is 5 g flour/ 2 g sugar.



, If you'd like to turn the ratio into a percentage, you just have to complete the following steps:


Divide the first number by the second number. Ex: 5/2 = 2.5.
Multiply the result by 100. Ex: 2.5 * 100 = 250.
Add a percentage sign. 250 + % = 250%.
This indicates that for every 1 unit of sugar, there is 2.5 units of flour; it also means that there is 250% as much flour as there is sugar.

, Compile all of your data and numbers into a list. Organize your data into a table with each item labeled and explained.

, Make sure that you have collected enough information to answer the question or present the information that you want your pictograph to represent. If you are collecting information on states, make sure you have collected data from many different states to accurately represent your data.

, Write a short description of what people will understand by looking at your pictograph. The description will help you determine what symbols you should use and make sure you’ve made the pictograph correctly.For example, ""The number of pecans harvested in different states in 2050.

, Set a numerical value that is represented by a particular picture. Using whole numbers such as 10, 100, or 1000 are good starting points.


Use different pictures represent higher or lower values. One pecan could equal 1 million pounds.
Use fractions of a picture, such as half a pecan, to represents parts of a whole. Half a pecan equals 500,000 pounds.

, Go through your list of data and determine what pictures you need to represent each group of data. Write a note that tells you what you will draw for each data point you collected. If you know 7.5 million pecans were harvested in Georgia, you would draw 7 and a half pecans., A pictograph can be made with the help of computer programs such as excel.

, A pictograph is a type of graph and will have labels on the side and below to tell what is being represented. The axes of a graph are a vertical and horizontal line that serve as an outer boundary or margin for the graph.Label one axis with the category of the data that was collected, such as “States”
Label the other axis with the type of data collected, such as “Number Pecans Harvested”

, Using the data table you created, fill in the pictures for each category of data.Draw the corresponding numbers of each symbol to represent the numbers in the data you collected.
Be careful to use the right symbol or partial symbol to accurately represent each number.

, Under each column of pictures, write the source of the data. For each state where monarchs were seen, you would write the name of the state under the pictures.


You can also write the number that is being represented by the pictures to help make the pictures more concrete and easier to understand.

, In the corner of your pictograph draw a key that tells the reader of the pictograph what each picture represents.


Make sure that each symbol used in the pictograph is represented on the key.
If you used partial symbols, such as half a pecan, define how much the partial symbol represents.
Label the key so readers know it is the key and not an additional category of data.

, If you are giving a presentation or making a poster to describe data, pictographs are a quick way to present a large amount of data. A well made pictograph will give a person an easy way to understand and compare data at a glance

The order of the quantities doesn't matter.,
A ratio can also be used to describe probability.,
You can scale a ratio up as well as down.",How to Make a Ratio2," The ratio simply represents the relationship between two quantities. ""5 apples to 3 pears"" is the same as ""3 pears to 5 apples."" Therefore, 5 apples/ 3 pears = 3 pears/ 5 apples.

, For example, the probability of rolling a 2 on a die is 1/6, or one out of six. Note: if you're using a ratio to denote probability, then the order of quantities does matter.

, Though you may be used to simplifying numbers whenever you can, it can benefit you to scale a ratio up. For example, if you know that you'll need 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of pasta you boil (2 cups water/1 cup pasta), but you want to boil 2 cups of pasta, then you'll need to scale up the ratio to know how much water to use. To scale up a ratio, simply multiply the top and bottom by the same number.


2 cups water/ 1 cup pasta * 2/ 2 = 4 cups water/ 2 cups pasta. You'll need 4 cups of water to boil 2 cups of pasta.

Let's say we start the numbers 1, 3, 2, 4, and 5. These will be used for calculation examples.






;
, Take all your numbers and line them up in order, so that the smallest numbers are on the left and the largest numbers are on your right. In our case, the order of the numbers is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.








, The median is the middle number in an ordered data set. (This is why we lined up all the numbers in Step 2.) For the data set in our example, 3 is the number that's exactly in the middle, and therefore is our median. The median is also called the second quartile.









In a data set with an odd amount of numbers, the median will always have the same amount of numbers on either side of it. For the data set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the median number, 3, has 2 numbers before it and 2 numbers after it. That's how we can be sure that it's our median.
What if the data set you're working with has an even amount of numbers? What if you had to find the median of 2, 4, 4, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15? You find the median here by taking the two middle numbers and finding their average. In our example, you would take 7 and 9 — the two middle numbers — add them up and divide them by 2. 7 + 9 equals 16, and 16 divided by 2 equals 8. The median of this data set would be 8.

, We've already found the second quartile of the data set, which is our median. Now we need to find the median of the lower half of the data set; in our example it would be the median of the two numbers to the left of 3. The median of 1 and 2 is (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5. Do the same to find the median of the two numbers to the right of 3. (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5.








, This should be long enough to contain all of your data, plus a little extra on either side. Make sure to place the numbers at even intervals. If you're dealing with decimals, such as 4.5 and 1.5, be sure to label them as well.








, Take the values of your first, second, and third quartiles and make a mark at those numbers on the plot line. The mark should be a vertical line at each quartile, starting slightly above the plot line., Connect the top or the first quartile to the top of the third quartile, going through the second quartile. Connect the bottom of the first quartile to the bottom of the third quartile, making sure to go through the second quartile.








, Find the smallest, and then the largest, numbers in your data set and mark them on the plot line. Mark these points with a small dot. In the case of our example, the lower outlier is 1 and the upper outlier is 5.








, The straight line that connects the outliers is informally called the ""whiskers"" of the box and whiskers plot.








, Look at a box and whiskers plot to visualize the distribution of numbers in any data set. You can easily see, for example, whether the numbers in the data set bunch more in the upper quartile by looking at the size of the upper box, as well as the size of the upper whisker. Box and whisker plots are great alternatives to bar graphs and histograms."
"
Write the numbers in your data set.,
Order the numbers from smallest to largest.,
Count the number of times each number is repeated.,
Identify the value (or values) that occur most often.,
Don't confuse a data set's mode with its mean or median.",How to Find the Mode of a Set of Numbers1," Modes are typically taken from sets of statistical data points or lists of numerical values. Thus, to find a mode, you'll need a data set to find it for. It's difficult to do mode calculations mentally for all but the smallest of datasets, so, in most cases, it's wise to begin by writing (or typing) your data set out. If you're working with paper and a pencil, simply writing the values of your data set in sequence will suffice, while if you're using a computer, you may want to use a spreadsheet program to streamline the process.


The process of finding a data set's mode is easier to understand by following along with an example problem. In this section, let's use this set of values for the purposes of our example: {18, 21, 11, 21, 15, 19, 17, 21, 17}. In the next few steps, we'll find the mode of this set.;
, Next, it's often a wise idea to sort the values of your data set so that they're in ascending order. Though this isn't strictly required, it makes the process of finding the mode easier because it groups identical values next to each other. For large data sets, it can be practically a necessity, as sorting through long lists of values and keeping mental tallies of how many times each number appears in the list is difficult and can lead to mistakes.


If you're working with paper and a pencil, re-writing can save time in the long run. Scan the set of numbers for the lowest number and, when you find it, cross it off in the first data set and re-write it in your new data set. Repeat for the second-lowest number, third-lowest, and so on, being sure to to write each number as many times as it occurs in the original data set.
With a computer your options are more extensive - for instance, most spreadsheet programs will have the option to re-order lists of values from least to greatest with just a few clicks.
In our example, after re-ordering, the new list of values should read: {11, 15, 17, 17, 18, 19, 21, 21, 21}.

, Next, count the number of times that each number in the set appears. Look for the value that occurs most commonly in the data set. For relatively small data sets with points arranged in ascending order, this is usually a simple matter of finding the biggest ""cluster"" of identical values and counting the number of occurrences.


If you're working with a pencil and paper, to keep track of your counts, try writing the number of times each value occurs above each cluster of identical numbers. If you're using a spreadsheet program on a computer, you can do the same thing by writing your totals in adjacent cells or, alternatively, using one of the program's options for tallying data points.
In our example, ({11, 15, 17, 17, 18, 19, 21, 21, 21}),11 occurs once, 15 occurs once, 17 occurs twice, 18 occurs once, 19 occurs once, and 21 occurs three times. 21 is the most common value in this data set.

, When you know how many times each value occurs in your data set, find the value that occurs the greatest number of times. This is your data set's mode. Note that there can be more than one mode in a data set. If the two values are tied for being the most common values in the set, the data set can be said to be bimodal, whereas if three values are tied, the set is trimodal, and so on.


In our example set, ({11, 15, 17, 17, 18, 19, 21, 21, 21}), because 21 occurs more times than any other value, 21 is the mode.
If a value besides 21 had also occurred three times, (like, for instance, if there were one more 17 in the data set), 21 and this other number would both be the mode.

, Three statistical concepts that are often discussed together are means, medians, and modes. Because these concepts all have similar-sounding names and because, for a single data set, a single value can sometimes be more than one of these things, it's easy to confuse them. However, regardless of whether or not the data set's mode is also it's median or mean, it's important to understand that these three concepts are entirely independent of each other. See below:


A data set's mean is its average. To find the mean, add up all of the values in the data set, then divide by the number of values in the set. For instance, for our example data set ({11, 15, 17, 17, 18, 19, 21, 21, 21}), the mean would be 11 + 15 + 17 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 160/9 = 17.78. Note that we divided the sum of the values by 9 because there are a total of 9 values in the data set.






A data set's median is the ""middle number"" separating the lower and higher values of a data set into two equal halves. For instance, in our example data set, ({11, 15, 17, 17, 18, 19, 21, 21, 21}) 18 is the median because it is the middle number - there are exactly four numbers higher than it and four numbers lower than it. Note that if there are an even number of values in the data set, there is no single median. In these cases, the median is usually taken to be the mean of the two middle numbers.







"
"
Recognize that no mode exists for data sets in which every value occurs the same number of times.,
Recognize that modes for non-numerical data sets can be found in the same way as for numerical data sets.,
Recognize that for unimodal symmetric distributions, the mode, mean, and median coincide.",How to Find the Mode of a Set of Numbers2," If the values in a given set all occur the same number of times, the data set has no mode because no number is any more common than any other. For instance, data sets in which every value occurs once have no mode. The same is true for data sets in which every value occurs twice, three times, and so on.


If we change our example data set to {11, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21} so that each value occurs only once, the data set now has no mode. The same is true if we change the data set so that each value occurs twice: {11, 11, 15, 15, 17, 17, 18, 18, 19, 19, 21, 21}.

, Generally, most data sets are quantitative - they deal with data in the form of numbers. However, some data sets deal with data that is not expressed in the form of numbers. In these cases, the ""mode"" can be said to be the single value that occurs the most in the data set, much as it is for numerical data sets.In these cases, it may be possible to find the mode while being impossible to find a meaningful median or mean for the data set.


For example, let's say that a biological survey determines the species of each tree in a small local part. The data set for the types of trees in the park is {Cedar, Alder, Cedar, Pine, Cedar, Cedar, Alder, Alder, Pine, Cedar}. This type of data set is called a nominal data set because the data points are distinguished only by their names. In this case, the mode of the data set is Cedar because it occurs the most often (five times as opposed to three for Alder and two for Pine).
Note that, for the example data set above, it's impossible to calculate a mean or median because the data points have no numerical value.

, As noted above, it's possible for the mode, median, and/or mean to overlap in certain cases. In special, select cases where the density function of the data set forms a perfectly symmetrical curve with one mode (for example, the Gaussian or ""Bell-Shaped"" Curve), the mode, mean, and median will all be the same value. Because a distribution function graphs the relative occurrence of data points, the mode will naturally be in the exact middle of a symmetrical distribution curve, as this is the highest point on the graph and corresponds to the most common value. Because the data set is symmetrical, this point on the graph will correspond with the median - the middle value in the data set - and the mean - the average of the data set.


For example, let's consider the data set {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5}. If we were to graph the distribution of this data set, we'd get a symmetrical curve that reaches a height of 3 at x = 3 and tapers off to a height of 1 at x = 1 and x = 5. Because 3 is the most common value, it is the mode. Because the central 3 in the data set has 4 values on either side of it, 3 is also the median. Finally, the average of the data set works out to 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 27/9 = 3, meaning that 3 is also the mean.
The exception to this rule is for symmetrical data sets with more than one mode - in this case, because there can be only one median and mean for the data set, both modes will not coincide with these other points.

Arrange the set of numbers in order from smallest to largest.,
Identify the smallest and largest numbers in the set.,
Subtract the smallest number from the largest.,
Write down your range.",How to Find the Range of a Data Set," Let's say your data set contains the following numbers: {7, 8, 65, 8, 4, 7}. All you have to do is rewrite them from smallest to largest, to get a better sense of the data you are working with. Here's how it would look: {4, 7, 7, 8, 8, 65}.;
, In the set you are working with, the smallest number is 4 and the largest is 65. These numbers can be conveniently located on either end of the set of data, since you rearranged the numbers from smallest to largest.

, Now, all you have to do is subtract the smallest number, 4, from the largest number, 65. 65-4 = 61.

, ""61"" represents the range of this particular set of data. You're all done. If you want to find the range of a function, then you'll have to follow a slightly more complicated process, but this is all you have to do to calculate the range of a set of data.

Know how the IQR is used.,
Understand quartiles.,
Learn the formula.",How to Find the IQR1," Essentially, it is a way of understanding the spread or ""dispersion"" of a set of numbers.The interquartile range is defined as the difference between the upper quartile (the highest 25%) and the lower quartile (the lowest 25%) of a data set. The lower quartile is usually written as Q1, and the upper quartile is Q3 – which would technically make the halfway point of the data set Q2, and the highest point Q4., To visualize a quartile, chop a list of numbers into four equal parts. Each of these parts is a ""quartile.""Consider the set: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.


1 and 2 are the first quartile, or Q1
3 and 4 are the second quartile, or Q2
5 and 6 are the third quartile, or Q3
7 and 8 are the fourth quartile, or Q4

, In order to find the difference between the upper and lower quartile, you'll need to subtract the 75th percentile from the 25th percentile. The formula is written as: Q3 – Q1 = IQR."

Assemble your data.,
Calculate the mean of x.,
Find the mean of y.,
Determine the standard deviation of x.,
Calculate the standard deviation of y.,
Review the basic formula for finding a correlation coefficient.,
Find the correlation coefficient.,
Interpret your result.",How to Find the Correlation Coefficient1," To begin calculating a correlation efficient, first examine your data pairs. It is helpful to put them in a table, either vertically or horizontally. Label each row or column x and y.For example, suppose you have four data pairs for x and y. Your table may look like this:

x || y

1 || 1

2 || 3

4 || 5

5 || 7


;
, In order to calculate the mean, you must add all the values of x, then divide by the number of values.Using the example above, note that you have four values for x. To calculate the mean, add all the values given for x, then divide by 4. Your calculation would look like this:


μx=(1+2+4+5)/4{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=(1+2+4+5)/4}


μx=12/4{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=12/4}


μx=3{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=3}


, To find the mean of y, follow the same steps, adding all the values of y together, then dividing by the number of values.In the example above, you also have four values for y. Add all these values, then divide by 4. Your calculations would look like this:


μy=(1+3+5+7)/4{\displaystyle \mu _{y}=(1+3+5+7)/4}


μy=16/4{\displaystyle \mu _{y}=16/4}


μy=4{\displaystyle \mu _{y}=4}


, Once you have your means, you can calculate standard deviation. To do so, use the formula:σx=1n−1Σ(x−μx)2{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{n-1}}\Sigma (x-\mu _{x})^{2}}}}

With the sample data, your calculations should look like this:


σx=14−1∗((1−3)2+(2−3)2+(4−3)2+(5−3)2){\displaystyle \sigma _{x}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{4-1}}*((1-3)^{2}+(2-3)^{2}+(4-3)^{2}+(5-3)^{2})}}}


σx=13∗(4+1+1+4){\displaystyle \sigma _{x}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{3}}*(4+1+1+4)}}}


σx=13∗(10){\displaystyle \sigma _{x}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{3}}*(10)}}}


σx=103{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}={\sqrt {\frac {10}{3}}}}


σx=1.83{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}=1.83}


, Using the same basic steps, find the standard deviation of y. You will use the same formula, using the y data points.With the sample data, your calculations should look like this: 


σy=14−1∗((1−4)2+(3−4)2+(5−4)2+(7−4)2){\displaystyle \sigma _{y}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{4-1}}*((1-4)^{2}+(3-4)^{2}+(5-4)^{2}+(7-4)^{2})}}}


σy=13∗(9+1+1+9){\displaystyle \sigma _{y}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{3}}*(9+1+1+9)}}}


σy=13∗(20){\displaystyle \sigma _{y}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{3}}*(20)}}}


σy=203{\displaystyle \sigma _{y}={\sqrt {\frac {20}{3}}}}


σy=2.58{\displaystyle \sigma _{y}=2.58}


, The formula for calculating a correlation coefficient uses means, standard deviations, and the number of pairs in your data set (represented by n). The correlation coefficient itself is represented by the lower-case letter r or the lower-case Greek letter rho, ρ. For this article, you will use the formula known as the Pearson correlation coefficient, shown below:ρ=(1n−1)Σ(x−μxσx)∗(y−μyσy){\displaystyle \rho =\left({\frac {1}{n-1}}\right)\Sigma \left({\frac {x-\mu _{x}}{\sigma _{x}}}\right)*\left({\frac {y-\mu _{y}}{\sigma _{y}}}\right)}

You may notice slight variations in the formula, here or in other texts. For example, some will use the Greek notation with rho and sigma, while others will use r and s. Some texts may show slightly different formulas; but they will be mathematically equivalent to this one.


, You now have the means and standard deviations for your variables, so you can proceed to use the correlation coefficient formula. Remember that n represents the number of values you have. You have already worked out the other relevant information in the steps above.Using the sample data, you would enter your data in the correlation coefficient formula and calculate as follows:


ρ=(1n−1)Σ(x−μxσx)∗(y−μyσy){\displaystyle \rho =\left({\frac {1}{n-1}}\right)\Sigma \left({\frac {x-\mu _{x}}{\sigma _{x}}}\right)*\left({\frac {y-\mu _{y}}{\sigma _{y}}}\right)}


ρ=(13)∗{\displaystyle \rho =\left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)*}ρ=(13)∗(6+1+1+64.721){\displaystyle \rho =\left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)*\left({\frac {6+1+1+6}{4.721}}\right)}


ρ=(13)∗2.965{\displaystyle \rho =\left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)*2.965}


ρ=(2.9653){\displaystyle \rho =\left({\frac {2.965}{3}}\right)}


ρ=0.988{\displaystyle \rho =0.988}


, For this data set, the correlation coefficient is 0.988. This number tells you two things about the data. Look at the sign of the number and the size of the number.Because the correlation coefficient is positive, you can say there is a positive correlation between the x-data and the y-data. This means that as the x values increase, you expect the y values to increase also.

Because the correlation coefficient is very close to +1, the x-data and y-data are very closely connected. If you were to graph these points, you would see that they form a very good approximation of a straight line.

Gather your data.,
Organize your data set in ascending order.,
Divide the data in half.",How to Find the IQR2," If you're learning this for a class and taking a test, you might be provided with a ready-made set of numbers, e.g. 1, 4, 5, 7, 10. This is your data set – the numbers that you will be working with. You may, however, need to arrange the numbers yourself from some sort of table or word problem. Make sure that each number refers to the same sort of thing: for instance, the number of eggs in each nest of a given bird population, or the number of parking spots attached to each house on a given block., In other words: arrange the numbers from lowest to highest. Take your cue from the following examples.

Odd number of data example (Set B): 5 8 10 10 15 18 23

, To do this, find the midpoint of your data: the number or numbers in the very center of the set. If you have an odd amount of numbers, choose the exact middle number. If you have an even amount of the numbers, the midpoint will rest between the two middlemost numbers.


Even example (Set A), in which the midpoint lies between 9 and 11: 4 7 9 | 11 12 20
Odd example (Set B), in which (10) is the midpoint: 5 8 10 (10) 15 18 23

Find the median of the lower and upper half of your data.,
Subtract Q3 - Q1 to determine the IQR.",How to Find the IQR3," The median is the ""midpoint,"" or the number that is halfway into a set.In this case, you aren't looking for the midpoint of the entire set, but rather the relative midpoints of the upper and lower subsets. If you have an odd number of data, do not include the middle number – in Set B, for instance, you would not figure in one of the 10s.Even example (Set A):

Median of lower half = 7 (Q1)
Median of upper half = 12 (Q3)


Odd example (Set B):

Median of lower half = 8 (Q1)
Median of upper half = 18 (Q3)



, Now you know how many numbers lie between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile. You can use this to understand how widely-spread the data is. For instance, if a test is scored out of 100, and the IQR of the scores is 5, you can assume that most of the people taking it had a similar grasp of the material because the high-low range is not very large. If the IQR of the test scores is 30, however, you might start to wonder why some people scored so high and others scored so low.


Even example (Set A): 12 - 7 = 5
Odd example (Set B): 18 - 8 = 10

Sort out your set of numbers from least to greatest.,
Find the average of the two numbers in the middle.,
Finished.",How to Find the Median of a Set of Numbers2," Again, use the same first step as the first method. An even set of numbers is going to have two numbers exactly in the middle.

, 2 and 3 are both in the middle, so you need to add 2 and 3, then divide the sum by 2. The formula for finding the average of two numbers is (the sum of the two middle numbers) ÷ 2.

, The median of a sequence with even amount of numbers doesn't have to be a number in the sequence itself.
