Search the Internet for correlation calculators.,
Enter your data.,
Calculate your results.",How to Find the Correlation Coefficient2," Measuring correlation is a fairly standard calculation for statisticians. The calculation can become very tedious if done by hand for large data sets. As a result, many sources have made correlation calculators available online. Use any search engine and enter the search term “correlation calculator.”
, Carefully review the instructions on the website so you will enter your data properly. It is important that your data pairs are kept in order, or you will generate an incorrect correlation result. Different websites use different formats to enter data.

For example, at the website http://ncalculators.com/statistics/correlation-coefficient-calculator.htm, you will find one horizontal box for entering x-values and a second horizontal box for entering y-values. You enter your terms, separated only by commas. Thus, the x-data set that was calculated earlier in this article should be entered as 1,2,4,5. The y-data set should be 1,3,5,7.

At another site, http://www.alcula.com/calculators/statistics/correlation-coefficient/, you can enter data either horizontally or vertically, as long as you keep the data points in order. 


, These calculation sites are popular because, after you enter your data, you generally need only to click on the button that says “Calculate,” and the result will appear automatically.

Enter your data.,
Clear any old stored data.,
Enter your data values.,
Calculate the linear regression statistics.,
Interpret your results.",How to Find the Correlation Coefficient3," Using a handheld graphing calculator, enter your calculator’s statistics function and then select the “Edit” command.Each calculator will have slightly different key commands. This article will give the specific instructions for the Texas Instruments TI-86.

Enter the Stat function by pressing -Stat (above the + key), then hit F2-Edit.


, Most calculators will keep statistical data until cleared. To make sure that you do not confuse old data with new data, you should first clear any previously stored information.Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to highlight the heading “xStat.” Then press Clear and Enter. This should clear all values in the xStat column.

Use the arrow keys to highlight the yStat heading. Press Clear and Enter to empty the data from that column as well.


, Using the arrow keys, move the cursor to the first space under the xStat heading. Type in your first data value and then hit Enter. You should see the space at the bottom of the screen display “xStat(1)=__,” with your value filling the blank space. When you hit Enter, the data will fill the table, the cursor will move to the next line, and the line at the bottom of the screen should now read “xStat(2)=__.”Continue entering all the x-data values.

When you complete the x-data, use the arrow keys to move to the yStat column and enter the y-data values.

After all the data has been entered, hit Exit to clear the screen and leave the Stat menu.


, The correlation coefficient is a measure of how well the data approximates a straight line. A statistical graphing calculator can very quickly calculate the best-fit line and the correlation coefficient.Enter the Stat function and then hit the Calc button. On the TI-86, this is .

Choose the Linear Regression calculations. On the TI-86, this is , which is labeled “LinR.” The graphic screen should then display the line “LinR _,” with a blinking cursor. 

You now need to enter the names of the two variables that you want to calculate. These are xStat and yStat.

On the TI-86, select the Names list by hitting . 

The bottom line of your screen should now show the available variables. Choose (this is probably button F1 or F2), then enter a comma, then .

Hit Enter to calculate the data.




, When you hit Enter, the calculator will instantly calculate the following information for the data that you entered:y=a+bx{\displaystyle y=a+bx} : This is the general formula for a straight line. However, instead of the familiar “y=mx+b,” this is presented in reverse order.


a={\displaystyle a=}. This is the value of the y-intercept of the best-fit line.


b={\displaystyle b=}. This is the slope of the best-fit line.


corr={\displaystyle {\text{corr}}=}. This is the correlation coefficient. 


n={\displaystyle n=}. This is the number of data pairs that were used in the calculation.

Understand the concept of correlation.,
Know how to find a mean.,
Note the importance of standard deviation.,
Recognize summation notation.",How to Find the Correlation Coefficient4," Correlation refers to the statistical relationship between two quantities. The correlation coefficient is a single number that you can calculate for any two sets of data points. The number will always be something between -1 and +1, and it indicates how closely connected the two data sets tend to be.For example, if you were to measure the heights and ages of children up to the age of about 12, you would expect to find a strong positive correlation. As children get older, they tend to get taller.

An example of negative correlation would be data comparing a person’s time spent practicing golf shots and that person’s golf score. As the practice increases, the score should decrease.

Finally, you would expect very little correlation, either positive or negative, between a person’s shoe size, for example, and SAT scores.


, The arithmetic mean, or “average,” of a set of data is calculated by adding all of the values of the data together, then dividing by the number of values in the set. When you find the correlation coefficient for your data, you will need to calculate the mean of each set of data.The mean of a variable is denoted by the variable with a horizontal line above it. This is often referred to as “x-bar” or “y-bar” for the x and y data sets. Alternatively, the mean may be signified by the lower-case Greek letter mu, μ. To indicate the mean of x-data points, for example, you could write μx or μ(x).

As an example, if you have a set of x-data points (1,2,5,6,9,10), then the mean of this data is calculated as follows:


μx=(1+2+5+6+9+10)/6{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=(1+2+5+6+9+10)/6}


μx=33/6{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=33/6}


μx=5.5{\displaystyle \mu _{x}=5.5}




, In statistics, standard deviation measures variation, showing how numbers are spread out in relationship to the mean. A group of numbers with a low standard deviation are fairly tightly collected. A group of numbers with a high standard deviation are widely scattered.Symbolically, standard deviation is expressed with either the lower-case letter s or the lower-case Greek letter sigma, σ. Thus, the standard deviation of the x-data is written as either sx or σx.


, The summation operator is one of the most common operators in mathematics, indicating a sum of values. It is represented by the upper-case Greek letter, sigma, or ∑.As an example, if you have a set of x-data points (1,2,5,6,9,10), then ∑x means:

1+2+5+6+9+10 = 33.

Find the sum of the numbers in the set.,
Divide the result by the amount of numbers in the set.,
Write down the average of each category.,
Write down the weight category of each average.,
Multiply the each average by its weight category.,
Add the results.",How to Find the Average of a Group of Numbers," The first thing you need to do is to add up all of the numbers in the set. Let's say you're working the following set of numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 6. 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.;
, There are 4 distinct numbers in the set. So, take the sum of the numbers, 12, and divide it by 4 to get the average. 12/4 = 3. The average of the group of numbers is 3.

, Use the method of finding the average -- adding up all of the numbers in the set and dividing the result by the amount of numbers -- to find the average of each category. Let's say you're trying to find your weighted average for a class and you're working with the following averages and weight categories:


Homework average = 93%
Test average = 88%
Quiz average = 91 %

, Remember that the weight categories should add up to 100%. Let's say you're working with the following weight categories:


Homework average = 30 % of final grade
Test average = 50 % of final grade
Quiz average = 20 % of final grade

, Now, simply convert each weight category into a decimal and then multiply it by the average it represents. 30% is really .3, or 3/10 of the final grade, 50% is really .5, or 1/2 of the total grade, and 20% is really .2, or 2/10 of the final grade. Now, multiply these decimal-converted weight categories by the averages they represent.


Homework average = 93 x .3 = 27.9
Test average = 88 x .5 = 44
Quiz average = 91 x .2 = 18.2

, To find the final weighted average, simply add up the three results. 27.9 + 44 + 18.2 = 90.1. The final weighted average of the three groups of numbers is 90.1.

Get a paper that's about twice as large as your desired envelope size.,
Fold the paper over evenly.,
Tape together the open left and right sides.,
Fold down the top to make a flap.,
Insert the letter or card.,
Glue the flap to keep your message enclosed.",How to Make an Envelope1," If in doubt, a standard size of 8.5 by 11 inches will do fine; you can fold and cut it in half before beginning if you want a smaller envelope.






;
, You should get a rectangle half the size of your original piece., Use tape to securely close the two open edges of the rectangle, leaving the top open. The top is where you will insert your letter.








, Make a small flap by folding down the open edge of the rectangle. This will keep the letter from falling out of the envelope. A flap that is about 1/2 of an inch will work.








, Bend back the flap, and insert your letter, card, or other contents. Fold the flap down again after this is done.








, Place a thin line of glue along the inner edge of the flap, then press the flap down. This will keep the envelope closed until the recipient opens it. You can also secure the flap with decorative tape or a sticker.

Lay a rectangular piece of paper down lengthwise (landscape-style).You can experiment with paper sizes, but if in doubt, a standard-sized (8.5 x 11 inches) will do.








,
Fold the paper in half lengthwise.,
Fold the top right corner along the center crease.,
Fold the top left corner along the center crease.,
Fold one inch of the top and bottom edges toward the center crease.The measurement here does not have to be exact, so you can eyeball the fold.,
Fold the right edge of the paper along the bottom of the triangle.,
Fold your message so it fits into the envelope.,
Insert your message.,
Close the envelope.,
Tape the edges shut.,
Hand-deliver your letter.",How to Make an Envelope2,", Match up the edges of the paper to ensure the fold is straight, and press down on the folded edge with your fingers to make a crease. Then, you can unfold the piece of paper, and it will have a crease in the middle.








, When the edge of the top right corner is touching the center crease in a straight line, fold the corner down. This will make a triangle shape with the top right corner.








, Fold the top left corner down as you did the right corner. Remember to smooth out the paper with your fingers to make a straight fold. You will now have two small triangles sitting on top of a rectangle.








, Both the top and bottom edges should be folded towards the center, leaving enough room in the center for a letter or card to fit, about one inch.









At this point, the paper should still be laying lengthwise
The triangular point of the paper should still be facing left.

, The edge of the folded triangle on the left-hand side of the paper should be parallel with the edge of the right hand side. The triangle itself will still be visible. Smooth out the fold with your fingers, then unfold it.








, Large cards may be too big for this method, but regular letter-sized paper will fit if folded in half or in thirds., Your note can go between the horizontal creases of the envelope. Use the bottom flaps of the triangle and the two length-wise flaps at the side to keep the message in the envelope.








, Fold the right hand edge of the paper back up to the edge of the triangle, just like did a moment ago. Fold the triangle top towards the center of the rectangle. Now, you will notice the back of your envelope looks like those bought in stores.








, Use small pieces of tape to secure the sides of the envelope. Tape the flap of the envelope closed as well.








, Unfortunately, postal services often charge more for mailpieces that are not precisely rectangular and those that do not have exact edges.Hand-deliver your homemade envelope if you do not want to pay extra shipping costs."

Get a square sheet of paper larger than your letter or card.If your letter or card is very large, you may need to go to a craft store to find the right size of paper.,
Place the paper so its corners are in a diamond shape.,
Fold the square corner to corner.,
Fold the bottom corner up to the middle crease.,
Fold the flat bottom of the corner up to the middle crease.,
Fold the left corner towards the center.,
Fold the right corner towards the center.,
Fold back the edge of the right corner.,
Spread the small triangle open.,
Insert the top edge of the envelope into the small opening.",How to Make an Envelope3," For example, if your card is 8.5 x 11 inches, then you will need at least a 12 x 12 inch piece of paper. For a small 4 x 5 inch card, a 7 x 7 inch piece of paper will work.








, The corners should face up and down, and right and left, like a diamond., This will create one crease going from the upper left to the bottom right corner and another crease going from the upper right to the bottom left corner. First, line up two of the opposing edges, crease, and then unfold. Repeat this for both the other corner, then unfold the edges so the paper lies flat in a diamond shape again.








, Touch the bottom corner to the point where both creases intersect in the middle of the paper. Then, crease the edge of the fold so the paper lies flat.








, Now, the paper will be triangular. The outer edges of the paper should line up almost perfectly. Smooth the fold so the paper lies flat.








, Fold the left edge of the triangle so the point goes slightly over the middle crease.








, The right corner of the triangle corner should overlap the crease, too.








, The right corner did not line up perfectly with the middle crease, so fold the overlapped point back slightly. The edge of the right corner should line up with the vertical crease. This will make a small triangle.








, When you stick your finger into the fold the of the small triangle, you will notice the small triangle naturally opens into a diamond shape. Spread and flatten the small triangle. The tiny diamond will have a crease down the center.








, Now, the envelope is finished! You can reopen the envelope to insert your card or letter, and close the top edge after it is inserted. You may want to secure any loose edges with tape if you have trouble keeping them shut.

Locate relevant studies and polls.,
Judge the source's reliability.,
Understand the background of the data.,
Interpret the statistics yourself.,
Use caution when producing your own statistics.,
Use statistical terms correctly.,
Focus on presentation and readability.,
Choose statistics that support your arguments.,
Present the data in context.,
Cite the source for your statistics correctly.",How to Find Statistics for a Research Paper," Before you can figure out what kind of statistics you need, you should have a sense of what your research paper is about. A basic outline of the points you want to make or hypotheses you're trying to prove can help you narrow your focus.For example, if you're writing a research paper for a sociology class on the effect of crime in inner cities, you may want to make the point that high school graduation rates decrease as the rate of violent crime increases.
To support that point, you would need data about high school graduation rates in specific inner cities, as well as violent crime rates in the same areas.
From that data, you would want to find statistics that show the trends in those two rates. Then you can compare those statistics to reach a correlation that would (potentially) support your point.;
, You won't truly understand what statistics are relevant to your paper until you've done a little background research. However, this doesn't mean you have to complete all your research for your paper before you start looking for statistics.Background research also can clue you in to words or phrases that are commonly used by academics, researchers, and statisticians examining the same issues you're discussing in your research paper.
A basic familiarity with your topic can help you identify additional statistics that you might not have thought of before.
For example, in reading about the effect of violent crime in inner cities, you may find an article discussing how children coming from high-crime neighborhoods have higher rates of PTSD than children who grow up in peaceful suburbs.
The issue of PTSD is something you potentially could weave into your research paper, although you'd have to do more digging into the source of the statistics themselves.
Keep in mind when you're reading on background, this isn't necessarily limited to material that you might use as a source for your research paper. You're just trying to familiarize yourself with the subject generally.

, Descriptive statistics, as the name suggests, merely describe a group of people or things. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, draw conclusions about a larger group based on characteristics of a representative sample.With a descriptive statistic, those who collected the data got information for every person included in a specific, limited group.
""Only 2 percent of the students in McKinley High School's senior class have red hair"" is an example of a descriptive statistic. All the students in the senior class have been accounted for, and the statistic describes only that group.
However, if the statisticians used the county high school's senior class as a representative sample of the county as a whole, the result would be an inferential statistic.
The inferential version would be phrased ""According to our study, approximately 2 percent of the people in McKinley County have red hair."" The statisticians didn't check the hair color of every person who lived in the county.

, Typically you can find the statistics you need online. However, to find relevant data and statistics, you must identify some key words that are most likely to get you the results you need.Finding the best key words can be an art form. Using what you learned from your background research, try to use words academics or other researchers in the field use when discussing your topic.
You not only want to search for specific words, but also synonyms for those words. You also might search for both broader categories and narrower examples of related phenomena.
For example, ""violent crime"" is a broad category that may include crimes such as assault, rape, and murder. You may not be able to find statistics that specifically track violent crime generally, but you should be able to find statistics on the murder rate in a given area.
If you're looking for statistics related to a particular geographic area, you'll need to be flexible there as well. For example, if you can't find statistics that relate solely to a particular neighborhood, you may want to expand outward to the city or even the county.

, Statistics are derived from data gathered through research studies and polls. Many of these statistics, along with the raw data from which the statistics were created, can be found online.While you can run a general internet search using your key words to potentially find statistics you can use in your research paper, knowing specific sources can help you find reliable statistics more quickly.
For example, if you're looking for statistics related to various demographics in the United States, the U.S. government has many statistics available at www.usa.gov/statistics.
You also can check the U.S. Census Bureau's website to retrieve census statistics and data.
The NationMaster website collects data from the CIA World Factbook and other sources to create a wealth of statistics comparing different countries on a number of measures.

, If the source of the statistics you've found isn't reliable, you can't rely on the statistics themselves either. To evaluate the reliability of the source, you'll use some of the same tools you use to evaluate the authority of a source you want to use in your research.Find out who was responsible for collecting the data, and why. If the organization or group behind the data collection and creation of the statistics has an ideological or political mission, their statistics may be suspect.
Essentially, if someone is creating statistics to support a particular position or prove their arguments, you cannot trust those statistics. There are many ways raw data can be manipulated to show trends or correlations that don't necessarily reflect reality.
Government sources typically are highly reliable, as are most university studies. However, even with university studies you want to see if the study was funded in whole or in part by a group or organization with an ideological or political motivation or bias.

, It's much easier to interpret the statistics, as well as assess their ultimate reliability, if you get information about the background of the study or poll and the people involved in it.To explore the background adequately, use the journalistic standard of the ""5 w's"" – who, what, when, where, and why.
This means you'll want to find out who carried out the study (or, in the case of a poll, who asked the questions), what questions were asked, when was the study or poll conducted, and why the study or poll was conducted.
The answers to these questions will help you understand the purpose of the statistical research that was conducted, and whether it would be helpful in your own research paper.

, Statistics are themselves an interpretation and summary of the data collected. However, once you get a statistic, you need to figure out for yourself what it means.You may find the statistics set forth in a report that describes these statistics and what they mean.
However, just because someone else has explained the meaning of the statistics doesn't mean you should necessarily take their word for it.
Draw on your understanding of the background of the study or poll, and look at the interpretation the author presents critically.
Remove the statistics themselves from the text of the report, for example by copying them into a table. Then you can interpret them on your own without being distracted by the author's interpretation.
If you create a table of your own from a statistical report, make sure you label it accurately so you can cite the source of the statistics later if you decide to include them in your research paper.

, Statistical analysis is a fairly complex process. There are entire university courses dedicated to how to calculate statistics correctly – it's not simply a matter of basic math.If you're looking at raw data, you may need to actually calculate the statistics yourself. If you don't have any experience with statistics, talk to someone who does.
Your teacher or professor may be able to help you understand how to calculate the statistics correctly.
Even if you have access to a statistics program, there's no guarantee that the result you get actually will be accurate unless you know what information to provide the program. Remember the common phrase with computer programs: ""Garbage in, garbage out.""
Don't assume you can just divide two numbers to get a percentage, for example. There are other probability elements that must be taken into account.

, When incorporating statistics in your paper, precise terms signal to your reader exactly how you're using the information and the conclusions you're drawing from it. Vague terms can led to confusion.For example, the word ""average"" is one you often see in everyday writing. However, when you're writing about statistics, the word ""average"" could mean up to three different things.
The word ""average"" can be used to mean the median (the middle value in the set of data), the mean (the result when you add all the values in the set and then divide by the quantity of numbers in the set), or the mode (the number or value in the set that occurs most frequently).
Therefore, if you read ""average,"" you need to know which of these definitions is meant.
You also want to make sure that any two or more statistics you're comparing are using the same definition of ""average."" Not doing so could lead to a significant misinterpretation of your statistics and what they mean in the context of your research.

, Dumping statistics into your writing can be clunky and awkward. If you're going to introduce several related statistics, it's often better to create a table or chart that your readers can more easily grasp.Charts and graphs also can be useful even when you are referencing the statistics within your text. Using graphical elements can break up the text and enhance reader understanding.
Tables, charts, and graphs can be especially beneficial if you ultimately will have to give a presentation of your research paper, either to your class or to teachers or professors.
As difficult as statistics are to follow in print, they can be even more difficult to follow when someone is merely telling them to you.
To test the readability of the statistics in your paper, read those paragraphs out loud to yourself. If you find yourself stumbling over them or getting confused as you read, it's likely anyone else will stumble too when reading them for the first time.

, It may sound obvious, but you have to be careful to insure that the statistics you're presenting actually apply to the situation you've described and bolster the point or conclusion you're trying to reach.This often has as much to do with how you describe the statistics as the specific statistics you use.
Keep in mind that numbers themselves are neutral – it is your interpretation of those numbers that gives them meaning.

, Even the most appropriate statistic is meaningless unless you provide enough information that the reader can ground the information in the bigger picture. This means you may need to dig deeper to find out more about the context surrounding the data itself.For example, if you present the statistic that the murder rate in one neighborhood increased by 500 percent, and in the same period high school graduation rates decreased by 300 percent, these numbers are virtually meaningless without context.
You don't know what a 500 percent increase entails unless you know what the rate was before the period measured by the statistic.
When you say ""500 percent,"" it sounds like a large amount, but if there was only one murder before the period measured by the statistic, then what you're actually saying is that during that period there were five murders.
Additionally, your statistics may be more meaningful if you can compare them to similar statistics in other areas.
Think of it in terms of a scientific experiment. If scientists are studying the effects of a particular drug to treat a disease, they also include a control group that doesn't take the drug. Comparing the test group to the control group helps show the drug's effectiveness.

, When using statistics in a research paper, it's important not only to provide a citation in your footnotes or bibliography, but also provide a textual citation.For example, you might write ""According to the FBI, violent crime in McKinley County increased by 37 percent between the years 2000 and 2012.""
A textual citation provides immediate authority to the statistics you're using, allowing your readers to trust the statistics and move on to the next point.
On the other hand, if you don't state where the statistics came from, your reader may be too busy mentally questioning the source of your statistics to fully grasp the point you're trying to make.

Understand the proper usage of the word you need.,
Create a mnemonic to help you distinguish between the words.,
Write you're as a contraction or a combination of the words you and are.,
Remember that you're is actually a combination of two words.,
Write your as the possessive form of you.,
Remember that the word your will usually not be followed by an adjective.,
Take a look at some examples.",How to Use You're and Your," The best way to do that is to sound it out. There is a replacement test that will tell you for certain which word will fit. Read the sentence with you are in place of where the your/you're is intended. If it makes sense, then you're would be right. If not, then your would fit. You could also replace your with my in the sentence. If it fits, then use your.;
, A mnemonic is a device that helps you remember something. You may find a mnemonic helpful when remembering the difference between you're and your. Elements such as parallelism and vivid imagery are usually effective mnemonic tools.


Consider the sentence ""If you're writing it you're, you're writing it right."" You are doing something when you write, and thus the contraction you're is correct.
You could also try something like the sentence ""Your Outraged Unicorns Race,"" where the first letter of each word spells out the correct usage. Because the unicorns belong to you, they're your unicorns.

, Other examples of contractions include doesn't for does not, they're for they are, and can't for cannot.


""You're a good friend"" means ""You are a good friend.""
""I don't know what you're talking about"" means ""I do not know what you are talking about.""

, It thus fulfills two very important roles in a sentence or clause. Because it includes both a pronoun and a verb, you're will always be the subject and at least part of the verb of any clause in which it appears.

, The possessive form refers to something that a person has, something that belongs to the person in question, or the person you are talking to. Your reflects ownership, as in ""yours, mine, and ours"".


""Is your stomach growling?""
""Your book is on the table.""

, In most cases, your will not be followed by an adjective (a word that describes something) when that adjective is describing the person that you are talking to.


In other words, saying ""Your very kind"" will almost never be correct. ""Your very kind"" would only be correct if someone were describing a noun, as in ""Your nice son brought me my coat."" Here, your nice is correct because nice is describing the person's son.

, Each of the following examples shows an incorrect use of your/you're, and why it is incorrect.


""I can't read you're handwriting.""

Incorrect, because the contraction for you are is being used in place of the possessive form of you. ""I can't read you are handwriting""' doesn't make sense. It should be replaced with your.


""If your hungry, then you should probably eat something.""

Incorrect because there is no possession in question. You can be hungry, but in English you don't possess hunger. This passes the replacement test. Rewriting it with you are fits. Your should be replaced here with you're, or you are.


""I think your very smart.""

Again, incorrect. The ""very smart"" does not belong to the person that you are talking to — this doesn't make any sense. Replace your with you're, or you are.


""I'm smarter than you're""

Correct, because the contraction for you are has been used in place of the possessive form of you. However, this unconventional usage is likely to confuse people, so avoid ending a sentence with you're even if it's grammatically correct.

Trim the envelope.",How to Make a Padded Envelope1," The cardstock will be the size of your finished envelope. The envelope can be made in any size you desire. For a standard vertical envelope, try making the cardstock 7.5 by 10.5 inches (19.05 by 26.67 cm). You may also make a horizontal one using a measurement such as 9.5 by 10 inches (24.13 by 25.4 cm).These measurements are meant to include a one inch (2.54 cm) flap at the top.
Cardstock, along with all other supplies, can be found at craft stores.;
, Patterned paper is thicker than printer paper and looks better, but you can still use printer paper or junk mail. Hold the cardstock against the paper. On three sides, cut the paper slightly longer than the cardstock.The fourth side should be the one that matches up with the cardstock flap.

, The bubble wrap needs to fit inside the envelope. For the 7.5 by 10.5 inch envelope, cut the bubble wrap down to 6 by 9 inches (15.24 by 22.86 cm). By making the bubble wrap shorter, you can glue the ends of the cardstock together to prevent the envelope from opening.

Instead of bubble wrap, you may also use packing foam sheets. Cut out a piece, fold it in half, tape up the sides, and glue it between the cardstock and paper., Lay the paper facedown. Spread glue around the outside edge of the paper, forming a border. Any glue can be used to fasten the parts of the envelope, but a stronger adhesive, such as rubber cement, works best., Choose one piece of bubble wrap and line it up with the top edge of the paper. Keep the bubble side facedown and set it in the glue., Lay the cardstock flat, leaving the side you will use as a flap at the top. Spread an inch or two (about seven cm) of glue across the bottom edge. Next, apply glue about an inch below the top edge of the cardstock. Spread a line of glue from side to side, taking care not to put glue on the part above that will serve as the flap., Line up the top edge of the second bubble wrap sheet and the top strip of glue on the cardstock. Again, keep the bubble side facedown as you secure the wrap to the cardstock., Look at the bottom edge of the cardstock. Aim about ¼ of an inch (6/10 cm) from the left and right sides. Using scissors, cut diagonally upwards to the edge of the bubble wrap. Do this on both sides., Lay the cardstock flat with the bubble wrap facing upwards. Pick up the paper with the attached bubble wrap. Align the corners of the bubble wrap over one another., Work one edge at a time. While holding the envelope still with your palms, press two fingers on the center of the left or right edge. Move your fingers towards the corners. Repeat this with the opposite edge and then the bottom edge.

Run a rounded object such as a pen over the edges to make sure they stay attached.

, Use scissors to cut off excess paper hanging off the edges. On the flap, you can make diagonal cuts to take off the corners. Then, try using a scoring tool or empty pen to create a folding line on the bottom of the flap."

Practice frequently.",How to Use Than and Then," When you are talking about a noun (thing, person, place or concept) being more, less, better, cooler, dumber, etc. in relation to another noun, the word than is necessary.There are more onions than scallions in your fridge.
Scott was sicker than a dog last week.;
, When you want to tell about a sequence of events or are giving instructions in a step-by-step order, the word then is necessary.First there were four, and then there were two.

Wash the clothes, then put them in the dryer.

, Both words contain one gliding vowel, and they are similar.Phonetically speaking, native speakers of English use the schwa (ǝ, kind of like a soft ""eh"" sound) because it's more efficient and allows words to be slurred together quickly in daily conversations. Consequently, lots of ""a""s and ""e""s are not pronounced distinctly.



Than is said with the mouth opened widely and the tongue pressed down toward the teeth. The vowel sounds from the back of the mouth and the throat is somewhat constricted.

Then is more said with the mouth partially opened. The vowel rises from a relaxed throat and the tongue rests.

, Ask yourself these questions when you're writing a sentence:


If I write the word ""next"" instead of ""then,"" will the sentence still make sense?

""I will go to the store next"" makes sense, so here we would say ""I will go to the store then.""
""I like apples better next papayas"" makes no sense. So we must be looking for ""I like apples better than papayas.""


If I write the phrase ""in comparison to"" instead of the word ""than,"" will the sentence still make sense?

""It costs more in comparison to a new car"" makes sense, so you'd want to say ""It costs more than a new car.""
""You'll never guess what happened to me in comparison to"" does not make sense at all. Therefore, you will want to say ""You'll never guess what happened to me then!""

, Word processing software (such as Microsoft Word) often has a built-in grammar check that will highlight incorrect usage. If your word processor underlines or highlights the word ""then"" or ""than,"" you may have chosen the wrong word. Re-read your sentence and make sure that you've chosen the correct spelling., Pay attention when you write essays or letters.

Understand when to use lose.,
Understand when to use loose.,
Know how to verify your usage.,
Think of a little trick to help you remember the spelling.",How to Know the Difference Between Lose and Loose," The first step in differentiating between these two words is to know what they mean. While these words do have some archaic usages, such as loose being used as a verb (""he loosed an arrow""), focus on the most common meanings of these words.



Lose: verb. To no longer have or fail to keep, or to suffer from a loss (compare to lost. using ""o"")

Loose: adjective. Unbound, unattached; free from constraint; not tight (compare to loosened, using ""oo"").;
, Good pronunciation will avoid confusion for your listeners.


In most standard English pronunciation, Lose is pronounced ""looz.""
In most standard English pronunciation, Loose is pronounced ""loos.""

, Because lose is a verb, you will use it when describing something that you or someone else does. Remembering that lose is the opposite of win, which is also a verb, may help you.


For example, if you're forgetful, you might say that ""I lose my phone all the time."" Losing is an action that you do; it isn't describing a quality of something.
When you have ""misplaced an object or person from your possession"" or are ""close to defeat in a competition,"" use lose.


, Because loose is an adjective, you will use it to describe a quality of someone or something (but not something that someone does).


For example, if you have recently lost weight, you might say that ""All my clothes are too loose."" Loose is describing something about your clothes, but not an action that they do.
When something ""has free movement and is not restricted by restraints,"" use loose.


, Think about the grammatical functions of these words to test whether you have used the correct word. Replacing the word with another form of that word may help you determine proper usage.


Replace lose with lost to see if the idea still makes sense:

Correct: ""I always lose my cell phone"" -- a lost phone makes sense.
Correct: ""I think Bob is about to lose the race"" -- a lost race makes sense.
Incorrect: ""Mary likes to wear her hair lose and not in a ponytail"" -- lost hair isn't what you're talking about and doesn't make sense here.


Replace loose with loosened to see if the idea still makes sense:

Incorrect: ""I always loose my cell phone"" -- a loosened phone doesn't make sense.
Incorrect: ""I think Bob is about to loose the race"" -- a loosened race doesn't make sense.
Correct: ""Mary likes her hair loose and not in a ponytail"" -- loosened hair does make sense.



, When it comes to writing down the right word, try to remember that:""Lose has lost an o"" (when lost it's past tense); that way you'll remember both its meaning and its spelling!


You could also try remembering the spelling with a mnemonic, such as ""If my shoes are too loose, I will lose the race.""

Keep a positive attitude.,
Go to class regularly.,
Find a study partner or form a study group.,
Ask questions.",How to Survive Geometry Class1," Math can cause stress in many people. Unfortunately, stress can hinder your memory and zap your will.If you approach geometry with a positive attitude, you are already giving yourself a good start.


Math is something anyone can learn. It is a myth that some people have math brains and others don’t.With appropriate effort and support, anyone can excel in geometry.
Unlike algebra, calculus, and other math subjects, geometry is more visual, and based on concrete concepts dealing with shapes and figures. You might find that even if you struggled with more abstract branches of math in the past, geometry is easy to understand, and even fun.;
, More than any other school subject, math is sequential, and skills and concepts build upon previous skills and concepts.If you miss one day, you are likely to be lost on the day you return, scrambling to keep up. This may lead to you losing two days of geometry, and it will be difficult to catch up.


If you need to make an appointment for part of the school day, try to schedule it so that it does not interfere with your math period.If you know in advance that you are going to be absent, talk to the instructor and see whether you can get the assignments for that day to preview and complete.
If you are absent, make sure you get all the work you need to complete from your instructor or a friend.
If you are gone multiple days in a row, find out how long the instructor will give you to make up the work. Making up a lot of work on top of keeping up with your current work can be a daunting task. Create a calendar with your deadline. Divide up your work into smaller assignments to complete each night, until all the make-up work is complete., You can make an agreement with a study partner to share notes if the other person is absent.Just make sure your study partner is reliable. If you form a group, you can get together with some of your classmates to review new concepts, or to review for a test.


Studying with friends can be fun, and will help ease any math anxiety you might have.

, If you get lost in the middle of class, you need to get your questions answered as soon as possible, or you risk falling further behind. Don’t be afraid to raise your hand and speak up. It is likely that if you are confused, other students in the class are confused as well.It is better to ask the teacher your questions, not your neighbor. Your neighbor may not have the right answer, or you may get in trouble for speaking in the middle of class. Also, while talking to your neighbor, you risk missing out on new information the instructor may be presenting at that time.
Many people are afraid to ask questions in class because they are embarrassed, and think they will look dumb. Although it’s unlikely a classmate will think you’re dumb (in fact, asking questions can make you look smarter), it is probably worth the risk of being embarrassed for a moment in order to make sure you understand the work. If your teacher is the one making you feel bad for asking a question, talk to your parents and principal.If you have trouble getting over your fear of asking questions in front of classmates, you can always write down your questions and ask your teacher after class.

Look over your class notes.,
Do problems similar to those that were assigned for homework.,
Join a study group.,
Have someone make up practice problems for you.,
Reward yourself for studying hard.,
Rest and eat well just before the exam.",How to Study for a Math Exam1," After school, look over the notes you took in class that day for 15 to 20 minutes. As a test approaches, review your notes for the entire unit or chapter more thoroughly. Pay special attention to the example problems the teacher provided in class, since these will help break down how a given procedure or formula works., Suppose you were assigned odd numbers for homework because the even numbers’ answers are in the back of the book. Work on those even-numbered problems, then check your answers to see where your strengths and weaknesses are.Ask your teacher if your math book has an online website. Sometimes online textbooks can help by providing quizzes and additional instructional material.

, Different people see concepts in different ways. Something that you have difficulty understanding may come easily to a study partner. If everyone in the group is confused about something, ask the teacher for help.You could meet once or twice a week in person, talk over the phone, or chat online.

, If you’re in a study group, you can create and exchange practice tests for each other. Ask a family member or someone in your class to work on practice examples together. If your textbook has a website, see if you can download practice exams.Give yourself a time limit when taking a practice test to simulate the real thing.

, You deserve a break after a few hours of intense studying! Figure out some way to treat yourself after studying hard to help motivate yourself.For example, you could have a candy bar, go on a bike ride, play a game for 20 minutes, or do something other low-key activity you enjoy.

, Try not to be stressed as the exam approaches. Get a good night’s sleep the night before the exam. Have a full breakfast that morning and, if the test is later in the day, a good lunch.Try having a light, healthy snack, like almonds, before the test to give your brain a little more fuel.

Eat a good breakfast.",How to Pass Calculus," It details what concepts you will be learning, what part of the book the material corresponds to, when you have homework, quizzes, and exams, and how much everything is worth.

 The first day of class, add all of the homework due dates and quizzes/exams to your calendar. 

Look for the grade/GPA thresholds - the lowest percentage for an A is what you should stay above. Because calculus, especially Calculus II, can be difficult, there may be a curve that depends on the professor and how well your peers do. If the professor doesn't elaborate on his grading, ask.

Some professors may also have a ""course overview"" with the syllabus, with textbook sections that correspond. Take a glance at that to get a general picture of what the course will cover.

Note the topics on related rates, integration techniques, and series - they are often the hardest topics both conceptually and in the amount of algebraic manipulation required to get the answer. Integrating volumes (washers, shells, revolutions) can also be a tricky topic. 
;
, Drawing on their knowledge may help you gauge what you need to do to pass the course, such as difficult topics. Of course, what they find difficult may be easy for you, and vice versa, so don't base too much on their opinions. If the professor is the same, they might also know whether there are opportunities for extra credit.
, Look on the syllabus to see when office hours are. Most courses also have a TA that helps with grading - they may also have office hours as well. Review the material before you go so you can ask concrete, thoughtful questions instead of just saying, “I’m totally lost.” Professors like students who have made an effort, and it will be obvious to him. Out of all the tips in this section, this may be the most useful. 

This is also an opportunity to get to know your professor. Give some small talk, ask about his life, what he researches, etc. If, at the end of the semester, your grade happens to be on the border, he may be lenient in raising it by that 0.2% percent to get the A.


, This means writing down definitions, each step of worked examples, important remarks, etc. If going to lectures is how you learn best, you should be able to understand the majority of what goes on your notes because of listening to the professor. If not, ask questions for the things that you absolutely do not understand, since it's likely that other students are wondering too but aren't raising their hands because they don't want to slow the class down.

Review your notes frequently, especially right after class. Or at least, think about what you just heard. This means while you're doing your homework, at odd times, perhaps even right before class, not just the night before the quiz or test. Take care to not obsess too much over them that it takes over your social life, though.


, Textbooks these days can be obtuse and occasionally very dull. They may be scattered with various theorems or proofs that you may find tough to crack. Very recent textbooks may also have distracting colorful graphics as well. 

Both of those things are not as important as the actual substance. Of course, theorems are important to make the math rigorous, but at the level of calculus, they can be skirted past without much worry. Your professor will probably have more to say on them.

More importantly, you should do the worked examples as you read through the relevant sections (before the lecture) so that you understand how the topic is used in a concrete way. If there are graphs or diagrams that go along with them, you should be able to say to yourself, ""I know why the graph curves like that."" 

If you learn best by reading the textbook, then do so. If the author gives you a query (Why?) to some statement, then you should verify it. 


, You probably have a TI-83 or TI-84, or perhaps something newer. Play around with it and get a feel for the basic operations, exponents, trig functions, where you graph, solve matrices, etc. Don't be afraid to ask for help now on how to use it, because you won't get any on the exam.
, At the level of calculus, you need to be able to manipulate all the parts of formulas and work with variables. This means adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing things to both sides of equations. It also means taking logarithms to both sides to bring down exponents, and vice versa. It also means multiplying by 1 or adding 0 in a clever manner.


Most students who struggle with calculus fall behind not because of their inability to understand topics in calculus, but because they are not comfortable with algebraic and trig manipulations.


, It is easy to be intimidated by the plethora of letters that aren't x{\displaystyle x} or y,{\displaystyle y,} but they are merely symbols for things that you already understand.

Solving for variables is extremely important. Make sure that you can solve equations like 1A+BC+DE=F{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{A}}+{\frac {B}{C}}+D^{E}=F} for any of the six variables in terms of the other ones. To start you off, the answer for A{\displaystyle A} is given below. Notice there aren't any numbers - this is what we mean by ""solve in terms of"" the other variables.


A=1F−BC−DE{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{F-{\frac {B}{C}}-D^{E}}}}



Below is another example that you should practice with.


A2−BC2D=lnF{\displaystyle A^{2}-{\frac {BC^{2}}{\sqrt {D}}}=\ln {F}}



In each result, you should be able to answer when they are undefined. Anything in square roots should be non-negative, anything in the denominator cannot be zero, the domain of the logarithmic function consists of only positive numbers, etc.


, They are essential skills in calculus. You should recognize these things not just in the way that they were originally presented, but be able to recognize equations like e2x−2ex−6=0{\displaystyle e^{2x}-2e^{x}-6=0} as quadratic as well (quadratic in ex{\displaystyle e^{x}} - this also means, solve it! There is only one solution. Why?). Furthermore, you should be comfortable with completing the square.

Equations like 1x+2x2−4=0{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x}}+{\frac {2}{x^{2}}}-4=0} should be easy to solve. The quadratic formula should be drilled into you from past algebra classes.


, In the examples above, you had to use these manipulations to solve for some variables. They were less often used in algebra class, but that just means they are even more important to be familiar with.

For example, you should be able to solve for exponents in equations like ex−5=0{\displaystyle e^{x}-5=0} very easily. 

This also means that exponent and log properties are extremely important. When these functions show up, you know these properties are going to be used. 

The exponential function is ubiquitous in calculus because of the unique property that it is its own derivative. This alone means that you have to be comfortable with manipulating exponential functions. 


, Functions, identities, and their manipulations are used extensively. You need not memorize all of the identities - they are readily available online - but you should know their domains, ranges, signs (when cosine is positive and negative, for example), and be able to find all solutions to equations like sin⁡x=cos⁡x.{\displaystyle \sin x=\cos x.} Sine, cosine, and tangent are going to be encountered far more often than the others, so you should especially be familiar with them.

Don't be nervous if not all of the things in this section are second-hand to you. Do some practice problems and check your answers. Each time you do so, you are practicing your manipulation skills.


, The key to all STEM classes is practice. This cannot be understated. Do all the problems, and make sure you are doing them correctly by checking your answers after you have attempted it at least once. Go to office hours if you have trouble with a problem. If there is one problem that just cannot be done, do something else - listen to music, go to the gym, text your friends - do something other than math, then come back to it and try again. 

Try to do homework problems as close as you can to a quiz that covers it. This often means that homework will be done the day before it is due. Try to start in the afternoon - you may end up finishing in the evening or into the night. This may be unnerving, but homework is the best practice for doing well on quizzes and exams, and it is not worth the extra two days - two days that you can easily forget half the material for the quiz. 


, To do really well, don't just do the assigned homework; do all the problems. Most textbooks have answers to odd-numbered problems, so do the even-numbered problems as well. If you are strapped for time such that an essay in another class is more important, try to do a few problems every day instead of an entire problem set.

As you do these problems, you should be consulting your notes, peers, WolframAlpha, etc. less and less often. Remember, they cannot help you on the exam in any way while you are taking it.


, Videos on YouTube especially are a great resource for visualizations that can't be done in a book or on a chalkboard. It is a great way to get an intuitive feel for how things work. Wikipedia pages are also a great resource, though beware that the articles can quickly become very dense. 
, Some professors allow students to bring a notecard or even a page of notes. Try to take advantage of that so you don't waste time memorizing identities or integrals. Try not to write down things like integrals of even and odd functions over symmetric boundaries, or what to do when you're integrating a product of two functions, or how to implicitly differentiate - those are things that you should know before going in. A general guideline is that the more you find you have to write down (or the smaller your handwriting), the less you probably understand the material.

If not, then make some time to memorize the important integrals. Memorization is less important in STEM classes, but some calculus classes are relentless with integration, and it may be needed. Ask your professor if such integrals will be on the test. Again, the most important integrals will be used over and over again when doing u-substitution or integration by parts. Since calculus builds on itself, if no notes are allowed and you don't have them in your head when the time comes, you will be in trouble.

For example, you want to be thinking, ""how do I solve ∫xsin⁡(x2)dx{\displaystyle \int x\sin(x^{2}){\mathrm {d} }x} by u-sub,"" not ""what was the antiderivative of sin⁡u{\displaystyle \sin u} again.""


, Get together with some friends or classmates and meet at least once a week to do homework and study for tests and quizzes. Working through material with other people is very helpful because they might understand something that you are unsure of. On the flip side, you might be able to explain something to them that they don’t understand. The important thing with a study group is that you are productive, so you need to spend time with the right people - study groups can also be very unproductive and detract from your success in the class, even if they are your best friends.
, Teaching material is the best way to solidify it in your mind. Encourage them to ask questions. Mastery of the material will depend on how many insightful questions you can answer. Be sure that everything you are saying is correct, though. You do not want to have to ""unlearn"" something because you memorized an identity incorrectly.

If you find it difficult to explain something easily, go back and review that topic further until it makes sense. Don't stress about explanations too much - if you can easily apply something to problems on a test, that is all that is required.


, Most professors hand back homework and quizzes and don't take them back. You should be able to explain everything you got wrong - careless mistakes, or more urgently, not knowing where to start on a problem. The material will be in your notes and in the textbook. 

Some professors try to be cheeky and put in questions that many people missed on a later midterm or final. Just go through the problems, discuss them with your friends, look up topics on the Internet if you need further help, and you'll do fine. 


, Like all tests, don't burn yourself out, and just relax. Eat a banana and walk into the building listening to Mozart, not with equations and concepts swarming in your head.

Complete all your homework.,
Show all your work on your homework.,
Check homework that is returned to you.This will let you see what you missed, so that you can learn from your mistakes.",How to Survive Geometry Class2," Homework might seem boring or redundant, but it is important because it helps you practice applying the skills and concepts you learned during class.Plus, if you do the homework, you might realize that you do not understand a concept as well as you thought you did, and the next day you can ask your instructor for additional help.

, Usually your teacher will require this for full credit, but it also allows you to check your work. Additionally, if you show your work, it is easier to review with your parents, teacher, or tutor, because they can see what you did for the problems and identify any misconceptions you might have, or common errors you make., If your instructor did not mark which problems you got wrong, speak to him or her after class.

Don’t wait until test time to study.,
Keep a notebook for formulas.,
Use online resources.",How to Survive Geometry Class3," You will be more successful if you study throughout the course, practicing a little each night to make sure you understand the concepts. Like all math exams, to be successful on geometry tests you need to be able to apply skills that you have learned. You can cram to memorize formulas, but applying skills takes practice over time., There are a lot of formulas involved in geometry, and it can be difficult to keep them straight in your mind. So, it is helpful to have a notebook you use solely to organize your formulas (such as the Pythagorean Theorem, area of a circle, surface area of a cone, etc.). Include an illustration or example with each formula so that you can remember what it means.


You need to have a good understanding of all formulas as you progress in geometry. Certain formulas you learn at the beginning of the year may help you solve problems you need to solve at the end of the year. Often the test or textbook won’t tell you which formula you need to use, so the more formulas you have at your disposal, the more successful you will be.
Review your formula notebook regularly, not just before a test.

, There are numerous online resources for geometry help.



Khan Academy is a popular resource for instructional videos.

Wolfram MathWorld offers numerous tutorials on various math concepts.

Mathematics Stack Exchange is a message board on which you can post a math question to have answered by the community.

Seeing your teacher break down a problem on the board is key, since math is typically more visual than other subjects due to the equations and problem solving.Jot down any example problems from the session/class. When you review your notes later on, you will have a better feel for the specific lesson that was taught, rather than relying on your textbook.

, The teacher might not tell you specifically what is going to be on the exam, but they might give you helpful guidance if you don't understand. Asking questions about material that confuses you will also show the teacher you care about doing well in the class.Each night after school, look over your notes. Highlight any questions you have and take them to your teacher for further explanation.

, Make sure you read all of the assigned text and not just the examples. Textbooks often include proofs of the formulas that will help you understand the lesson much more thoroughly. Further, if you do the assigned reading, you'll be better prepared for each class, so you'll be able to actively participate.Actively participating, or raising your hand to respond to and ask questions, will help your grade in the long run.

Start studying as early as possible.,
Do your homework problems.,
Get to know how a formula works.",How to Study for a Math Exam3," Start preparing for the test on day one of the unit. Each night after class, look over your notes from that session. Cramming the night before will just overwhelm you.If you give yourself time to study gradually, you’ll have a better shot at mastering the material. In addition, you’ll be able to identify weak spots and, if necessary, get extra help.

, Most classes have assigned, or at least suggested, problems that the teacher feels are most useful. Exam problems are often similar to homework problems, so doing your daily homework is like taking a little practice test each day.If your textbook provides answers in the back of the book, use them only to check your work. If you choose to use them, try not to peek until after you've finished the assignment!
Do all the work for each equation, and keep your homework papers. Use them to study as the test approaches. Never just copy someone else’s homework.

, It’s typically more useful to understand how a formula is derived than simply memorizing it. Memorization is a good first step, but getting a feel for why a formula works by doing plenty of practice problems will increase your shot at passing with flying colors.For example, you could simply memorize the sum of a triangle's interior angles, which always add up to 180 degrees. However, if you really get a feel for that formula, you could use it to solve other problems, like figuring out an unknown angle in a hexagon.

, Instead of rushing through your homework, take the time to actually think everything through. Don't lose unnecessary points just because you made some stupid mistake that you would not have made if you had not rushed.

, If you're allowed to use it, that means that you will probably have to, or you wouldn't be allowed to use it.

, Even if it will solve anything you'll encounter, not knowing how to get it to solve anything will be a definite setback.

, You can help each other through things you don't understand.

, As long as you're not ignoring them, most teachers would be happy to re-explain something if you don't get it; it shows you actually care.

, If some of the concepts just don't make sense, you might need one-on-one help from someone.

, You'll probably remember something like SOH CAH TOA better than ""Sine equals opposite over hypotenuse, etc."" Here are a few to get you started:


SOH CAH TOA: Sine equals Opposite over Hypotenuse, Cosine equals Adjacent over Hypotenuse, Tangent equals Opposite over Adjacent.
Si si co co si(si is pronounced like ""sine"" without the n): Sin(x+y) = sin(x)cos(y) + cos(x)sine(y). Remember that the operation in the parentheses of the initial sine will be the same as the operation on the other side.
Co co co si si: Cos(x+y) = cos(x)cos(y) - sin(x)sin(y). Remember that the operation in the argument of the initial cosine will be different than the operation on the other side.

, Sometimes, if something is explained in a different way, understand it better.

Ask a friend to quietly think of a three-digit number.,
Your friend, will need a calculator.,
Now tell your friend to use the calculator to subtract the smaller number from the larger one of his or her secret pair (that's 902-209=693, in this example).,
Tell your friend to now take the result of the subtraction (693) and reverse that (396), and then to add it and its reverse together.

,
Your turn now.,
The first and last digits must have a difference greater than 1 because otherwise the following steps would produce a number which does not have 3 digits, therefore it would not work;
,
Reversing and subtracting the number gives the difference.,
No matter what number is chosen (so long as it fulfills the criteria), the first and last digit of the number derived from step 3 will always add together to make 9. a+b=c and 10+b-a=10-c, adding these together would give us 10, but as we had to ""borrow"" to complete our subtraction 1 has been taken from the first digit, therefore decreasing the number derived from adding the digits together by 1, making it 9.

,
Because the first and last digits add together to make 9, when the number is reversed and added to itself the first and last digits will be 9.,
This gives us 9 for our first digit, 18 for out second number (I know 18 isn't a digit; I'm getting there; be patient) and 9 for our last digit, however as 18 is NOT a digit the 1 must be carried into the first column, therefore leaving us with 9+1,8,9.",How to Learn a Math Trick," Get him or her to remember it. The only condition is that its first and last digit must be different by more than one - for example, 112 would not work because there is a difference of only one between the first and last digits (1 and 2).

, While you, on the other hand, don't. Now tell your friend, ""Reverse the number, but don't tell it too me."" For Example, if he or she chose 209 - reversing it would be 902.

, All this is done without your knowing what any of the numbers are.

,, Say, ""I can guess your secret total! Its 1089."" No, no! Do not tell anyone that it's 1089 no matter what numbers they pick; you'll be right every-time!
Do not do another example right then! Wait a week for forgetting, and try it on another person that may have been there before!

,, Notice that the 2nd digit of this number will always be a 9, this is because the 2nd digit of the original and reversed number are the same, therefore giving 0, and the last digit of the number you are subtracting is greater than the last digit of the number you are subtracting it from, therefore you must ""borrow"" from the digit before, leaving a 9 as the 2nd digit.

,, However, we still need to take into account our middle number. This is 9, so 9+9=18.

, which read together gives us 1089...

Taking the time to identify your problem type is essential to finding the best way to solve the problem., Even if the problem seems simple, read it very carefully. Don't just skim the problem and attempt to solve it. If the problem is complex, you may need to reread the problem multiple times before you fully understand it. Just take your time and don’t move on until you feel confident that you know what the problem is asking you to do. , To help wrap your mind around the problem that you are facing, it may help you to say or write it out into your own words. You can simply say it or write it out if you in a situation where you cannot speak out loud, such as during a test. Check what you have said or written against the original problem to make sure that you are representing the problem accurately. , If you think it will help with the type of problem you are facing, create a visual representation of the problem to help determine what you need to do next.

Ask yourself, “Do my answers match or closely resemble my estimates?” If they do not match up, consider why. Check your answers to see if you have completed all of the steps correctly. , If your plan is not working, go back to the planning stage and make a new plan. Don’t be discouraged if this happens, mistakes are common when you are just learning how to do something and you will learn from these mistakes. Accept your mistakes and move on. Try not to dwell on them or get upset. , When you have solved the problem correctly, look back at your process. Taking a moment to reflect on the problem and how you solved it will help you the next time you encounter a similar problem. It will also help you to identify any concepts that you need to learn more about and practice. .

Exercise.",How to Pay Attention in Math Class," Taking notes helps in two ways. First, you’ll feel more active and engaged if you’re physically doing something. Second, you’ll be recording information that you can review later.


Make sure that you can process what the teacher is saying. If you have trouble writing and listening at the same time, first absorb what the teacher is saying, then copy it down in your notebook.;
, Doodling can actually help you pay attention to what the teacher is saying by keeping your body occupied.You can doodle in color around your notes, which will make them more distinctive and easy to recall.


Math classes offer a lot of interesting visuals that you can doodle with-- graphs, matrices, geometric shapes and equations are all fun to doodle in the margins and change around. The benefit is that you will actually be thinking about math subconsciously if you doodle using math shapes.

, You might go into class with the best of intentions, but the more bored you are by the class, the more tempting distractions will be. It’s best to avoid them altogether.


Avoid talking about unrelated topics with your friends. You can discuss the material, but don’t get sidetracked. If you tell them that you need to raise your math grade, they will understand when you disengage from conversation.
If you often leave class or space out, remember that paying attention to something that you find boring is also a matter of willpower. Willpower is like a muscle-- the more you use it, the stronger it becomes. If you can get through one lesson without leaving class, you’ve become that much better at staying engaged in class. Don’t give up-- as you strengthen your willpower, paying attention in class will become more of a habit than a chore.

, Whether you are doing research for class or quickly checking your email, the immediate gratification that you get from your phone will make it harder to pay attention.


While multitasking may feel good and productive, it is actually just feeding your need to see something new every few seconds. You will find it easier to focus if you shut you phone off, put it in your bag, and check it at the end of class.

, Don’t let yourself fall behind because you failed to understand something. If you feel like you’re missing something, don’t get distracted. Ask a question and stay engaged in the lesson.


Don’t be embarrassed. If you don't ""get it"", there are probably other students who don't either.
You can talk to your teacher after class if you’re having more trouble with the material. You can also use that time to ask the teacher about more concrete examples of how the material is relevant to real life- this can help you keep from feeling like it is completely abstract and unrelated.

, Math usually requires that you understand every step of the process. If you miss even the first quarter of class, you might have missed an important step, and you will be spending the rest of class trying to catch up.


Make up work you missed when you were sick. Talk to your teacher, and set up a time before or after school when you can meet to go over lessons.

, This means re-writing what you scribbled down in class in a format you truly understand. You don’t necessarily have to do this at the end of class, but maybe the following evening, or during a study hall. In some cases, using text rather than numbers can help you if you are not a “numbers person”., Your teacher didn’t assign your homework by accident. Ask yourself “Why did my teacher assign this homework question? What strategies am I meant to use to solve it?” It will likely be something that you recently learned in class.


Use homework to gauge how well you understand the material, and how much more time you need to spend on extra studying.

, As you take notes and do your homework, copy key problems on a separate sheet of paper. Keep adding to this throughout the unit, and then use it as a study guide come test time.

, If you spend more time on re-writing notes and making practice exams for yourself, you will need to spend less time struggling over homework and cramming before the test.

, Relying on memorization can only take you so far in math. If you have no context, there is no way you can simply memorize everything. Understanding how your lesson can be applied to your life will make it much easier to recall later.


Your teacher might be interested in making context a part of the class. Paying off the mortgage for a house or a car loan, figuring out what saving 65% of your allowance will come to in a year, and so on are good ways to connect to the math lessons and make them less abstract more real to you. Ask your teacher if they have any examples like these.

, Philosophers have been using math to deal with everything from the size of the earth to proving their own existence. It is only recently that math became a subject that was abstract and separate from life-- finding a concrete connection may help you be more comfortable with the concepts.


Math can be found in nature, outer space, and music. There are plenty of videos and books that cover this topic using everyday language. , Everybody learns differently, and it could be that your teacher’s style does not work for you. This doesn’t mean that you can’t understand the information-- it just needs to be given to you in a different way.


Ask your teacher for the name of a tutor. It is common for teachers to have the names of tutors for students who have issues with the material.

, There are plenty of resources online to help you solve your homework issues-- the trick is figuring out how to find them.


If your word problems are coming from standardized tests, you might be able to type in key phrases and find similar practice problems. Don’t use the specific numbers found in your problem, as this will rule out most available answers.
Your teacher has probably spent time researching math help online, so ask them for a helpful website.

, Even though you might be having issues with one particular problem, the core issue to solve is your understanding of the underlying concept.


Check your notes and your textbook. What is this unit called? What is the strategy for solving called? Use the terms from class and your textbook when you research homework questions, and you will be able to find lessons that address more than just one homework question.

, The most obvious reason you might be fighting sleep in math class isn’t boredom, it’s because you didn’t get enough sleep the night before. A study of high school students correlated better grades with sleeping better and getting to bed earlier. Elementary school children should get 10-11 hours of sleep.Middle schoolers should get 9-10 hours, while high school students should aim for 9 hours. In order to get a good night’s sleep, you should set a regular sleep schedule and stay with it, even on the weekend. Avoid eating or exercising right before bed (although more physical activity throughout the day will make sure you are ready for sleep come nighttime). Do the same relaxing activity every night before bed. This will train your brain to transition into sleep. , The body and the mind work in tandem, and if your body isn’t fed, your brain will suffer.Include protein, fat, complex carbs, and fiber in your diet.Leafy greens have a lot of iron and other beneficial vitamins and minerals in them. Make sure to eat whole grains to avoid a sugar rush.Coffee, tea, and energy drinks can help when you’ve had a bad night’s sleep, but a dependence on caffeine can cause you to be more sleepy in school. Try to use these things sparingly.

, A study correlated low iron in the body with lower concentration and the inability to pay attention. Another study linked zinc to memory function. .The brain needs to make amino acids and choline in order to work with neurotransmitters.

, These are important vitamins to boost memory. Vitamins B12, B9 and B6 help brain development and aid in the formation of chemicals native to the brain.Research has shown that they improve memory function.


B-vitamins are often found in animal products, so if you avoid a lot of animal products, be sure to take these in supplement form.

, Acetyl l-carnitine is said to help you focus. Also try the herb bacopa monnieri, which should help you focus by reducing anxiety.Both of these work best if you take them regularly over a long period of time-- results can take up to 6 weeks., Up to eight parts of the brain are affected by chewing gum. Chewing gum can increase blood flow to the brain, shorten the reaction time to mental stimuli, and improve alertness., Cardiovascular exercise increases blood flow to the brain, improving cognition and focus. Exercise also stimulates the growth of brain cells, which will aid your memory. Ask permission from your teacher, or take a quick bathroom break to stand and stretch. Try a few squats, jump up and down, or stretch your arms and hamstrings.
Physical activity can also reduce test anxiety, so try to do a little bit of cardio on the day that you’re meant to take a test. "

Learn how to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators.,
Learn how to divide a fraction by a whole number.,
Learn how to divide by a two-digit number.,
Learn how to add and subtract decimals.,
Learn how to multiply decimals.,
Learn about the volume of a 3D shape.",How to Pass Fifth Grade Math1," The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. Before, you added and subtracted fractions with like denominators. Now, the denominator will be different, so you have to follow extra steps. For example, if you are adding 12+24{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {2}{4}}}:

Think of the multiples of each denominator.For the first fraction, some multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.For the second fraction, some multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12.

Find the smallest multiple each denominator has in common. In this case, the smallest multiple is 4.

Rewrite one or both fractions as equivalent fractions, so that they have the same denominator. Use the smallest common multiple. In this case, 4. For the first fraction, 12=24{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}={\frac {2}{4}}}, so you can rewrite the problem as 24+24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {2}{4}}}.

Add the numerators. Keep the common denominator: 24+24=44{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {2}{4}}={\frac {4}{4}}}.
;
, To do this, you first multiply the denominator by the whole number. This becomes your new denominator. Then, you just keep the same numerator.For example, to divide 4÷13{\displaystyle 4\div {\frac {1}{3}}}, you would find 14×3=112{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4\times 3}}={\frac {1}{12}}}.


, You do this the same way you divide by a single digit number, except that instead of dividing into the first digit under the division sign, you divide into the first two digits under the division sign.To remember the steps of long division, use the phrase “Does McDonald’s Sell Cheese Burgers?” This will help you remember to Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Check, and Bring down.For example, to divide 15)3045¯{\displaystyle 15{\overline {)3045}}}, your first step is to divide 15 into 30.Since 30÷15=2{\displaystyle 30\div 15=2}, you would write a 2 above the 0. Next, multiply 15×2=30{\displaystyle 15\times 2=30}.Subtract 30−30=0{\displaystyle 30-30=0}.Bring down the 4.Since you can’t divide 15 into 4, place a 0 above the 4.Multiply 15×0=0{\displaystyle 15\times 0=0}.Subtract 4−0=4{\displaystyle 4-0=4}.Bring down the 5.Divide 45÷15=3{\displaystyle 45\div 15=3}. Write the 3 above the 5.Multiply 15×3=45{\displaystyle 15\times 3=45}.Subtract 45−45=0{\displaystyle 45-45=0}. So, 3045÷15=203{\displaystyle 3045\div 15=203}, with no remainder.


, You do this the same way you add and subtract whole numbers. The difference is that you have to make sure that the decimal points are lined up on top of each other. You also have to add extra zeros if one number has more digits than the other. Finally, remember to drop the decimal point down into your answer, so that it lines up with the decimal points in the number you were adding or subtracting.For example, to add 10.25+8.5{\displaystyle 10.25+8.5} rewrite the numbers so that they are on top of each other, with the decimal points lined up.Then, add a 0 to 8.5, so that it becomes 8.50. Next, you can add the number like you normally would. You get 1875.When you drop down the decimal point into your answer, you get 18.75. 


, You do this the same way you multiply whole numbers. While you are multiplying, you can ignore the decimal points. When you are done multiplying, count the number of places behind the decimal point in each factor. Add up the number of places. Then, count that same number from the right in your answer. Put your decimal point in this place.For example, to multiply 3.25×1.75{\displaystyle 3.25\times 1.75}, begin by multiplying 325×175=56875{\displaystyle 325\times 175=56875}. Then, since there are 2 places behind the decimal point in 3.25, and 2 places behind the decimal point in 1.75, you would count 4 places from the right in your answer. So 56875 becomes 5.6875.


, The volume of a shape is the space inside of the shape. Think of a box. The volume would be the space inside the box. To measure the volume, you need to think about the length, width, and height of the shape. The volume of a shape is measured in cubic units. There are two different ways to measure the volume.You can measure the volume of a shape by counting the number of unit cubes that fit inside the shape. For example, if you have a box that is 2 cubes long, 3 cubes wide, and 1 cube high, you can fit one layer of 6 cubes inside of it. This means the volume is 6 cubic units. If the box is 2 cubes high, you can fit 2 layers of 6 cubes inside of it. So that means the volume is 12 cubic units.

You can find the volume of shape by using a formula. A formula is like a recipe that tells you how to find something. The formula for the volume of a cube is volume=length×width×height{\displaystyle {\text{volume}}={\text{length}}\times {\text{width}}\times {\text{height}}}. For the box that is 2 cubes long, 3 cubes wide, and 2 cubes high, you would multiply 2×3×2=12{\displaystyle 2\times 3\times 2=12}. So the volume is 12 cubic units.

Buy a good calculator depending on the class you're taking.,
Know how to use your calculator.,
Sit next to friendly, positive people.,
Find extra learning materials.,
Show all your working.,
Be organized.",How to Pass a Math Class," If you're in a fast paced math class, they'll probably only teach a concept once and move on. This means that if you don't pay attention, you've just missed your one chance to learn it.;
, This will help you understand the concepts more clearly. Your homework will probably be the only time you get to practice what you just learned before a test, so you need to make sure you do it! If you can't attend the class for a day, ask your teacher to give you the homework you missed as soon as possible.

, A math class is not a class you want to only think you know what you're doing.

, Knowing what is asked of you is half the problem. Math is its own language (solve, expand, simplify, etc.). Becoming accustomed to this will really benefit you. Highlight key words in the question to ascertain what you need to find out. Attempting past exam papers will give you a feel of what to expect; many of these are available for download from your examination board's website..

, If you're taking a basic algebra class, a scientific calculator should suffice. If you're taking a calculus class, a graphing calculator will probably be necessary. Your teacher or professor should have a good idea of what's necessary as well, so asking them at the beginning of the term would be a good idea.

, It doesn't matter if your calculator has lots of fancy functions; if you don't even know how to add with it, you're wasting all of its features.

, These should be people you can turn to when you have a question about something, or don't know what to do for a certain problem. However, make sure they won't just give you the answer.

, Oftentimes, different sources will be better explaining some things than others. If you can expose yourself to a different explanation of a concept, you may understand something a lot better. Only use ""cheat books"" to check your answer.

, Most of the time, your teachers don't care as much about what you put down as an answer as the working that you show. Many will only give partial credit for the correct answer; the rest must be earned by showing your working correctly.

, If you aren't organized, doing all that homework will do nothing to help you. Many times, you think you're organized but to gain a true perspective on whether you are organized or not, ask someone you know that will give you an honest opinion.

Don’t believe you can’t be good at math.,
Don’t believe your gender or race has anything to do with it.,
Don’t believe you have to do math quickly to be good at it.,
Don’t believe math experts don’t make mistakes.",How to Overcome Math Anxiety1," Many people believe that you have to be born with a mathematical mind in order to be good at it, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Many people don’t realize how mathematically inclined they really are or how much math can be found in their existing interests.Math is found in all kinds of art and literature, sometimes it isn’t intimidating just because it’s presented in a way that makes sense to you.
Many people who seem good at math are just well prepared. If you spend a little time preparing yourself for your math class, you may find yourself much more comfortable.
Not only can you improve your math skills, but studies show that believing you can do better at math can help make you better at math!;
, Some people believe that certain genders or nationalities yield people that are better at math. That’s not true at all. In fact, anyone can become good at math through practice. There is no tie between gender or race and mathematical ability.
Things like the “gender gap” in math scores disappear in more gender-equal societies because everyone can be good at math when given a chance.
Some of the many incredible female and minority mathematicians include Katherine G. Johnson who aided in the American Mercury space missions and Annie Easley who played an integral role in developing the software that makes modern space travel possible., Some people solve math problems quickly, but math is not a race. Even Thomas Edison had trouble keeping pace with his contemporaries when it came to math; a person’s pace has nothing to do with their mental abilities.Solving new problems or learning new skills is difficult for everyone sometimes. The only math problems people can solve quickly are the ones they’ve seen before.When someone does something quickly, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy for them. Speed is not a measure of ability, it is the result of experience and practice., It’s easy to get discouraged when you get a problem wrong or struggle to master a mathematical skill, but remember that everyone makes mistakes, especially when learning something new.Don’t get down on yourself if you make a mistake. Identify where you went wrong and learn from it.
Even the best mathematicians of all time made mistakes, don’t be too hard on yourself.

Stay positive.,
Play games.,
Learn with friends.",How to Pass Fifth Grade Math2," Math can be hard, but you shouldn’t let that upset you. No one is born being good at math. You have to practice it. If you are confident about something, it makes it easier to do it. If you decide you hate math, you will never get better. So try to stay positive, and keep trying.

If you make a mistake, stay calm. Learn from it, and try again.


, There are many games that you need math to play. There are also games that help you learn math in a fun way. You can probably play math games at school. Ask your teacher if you can play math games if you finish your math work early. These can be board games, apps, or computer games. You can also ask your parents if you can find some apps and games to download to your computer or tablet.

Cool Math is a great web site that has many free math games.Make sure you know the password to math games you play at school, like ST Math (JiJi) or iReady, so that you can play at home or when you have a substitute teacher.

Play math board games the right way. Follow the directions. If you don’t follow the directions, the game might not be helping you use math.

Some board games you need to use math to play include Pay Day, Ticket to Ride, or Sumoku. You can also find many variations of math bingo and Monopoly.


, Everything is more fun when you do it with friends. When your teacher lets you work with a partner, make sure you are actually doing the work and not playing. If you stay after school, see if you and your friends can work on your math homework together. You can also ask your parents if you can do homework with friends on the evenings or weekends.

A friend can also be very helpful. If you don’t know how to do a problem, your friend might. You might be able to do some problems your friend can’t.

Take notes.,
Write down your homework.,
Complete all your work.,
Keep your desk neat.",How to Pass Fifth Grade Math3," By fifth grade your teacher probably expects you to take notes. You should have a math notebook. If you don’t, ask your parents to buy one for you. In your notebook you should write down definitions and sample problems your teacher shows you. You can also write notes out of your textbook.

Your notes can help you do homework when your teacher is not around to help. It can also help you study for a test.


, Your school probably gave you an agenda or planner. If you didn’t get one, or you lost yours, ask your parents or teacher to get you a new one. Use your agenda to keep track of your assignments.

Even if your teacher doesn’t check your agenda every day, write down your math homework. This way, when you get home, you can remember what you are supposed to do. 


, The best way to be good at math is to do your work. Your classwork and homework are supposed to help you get better. If you don’t understand how to do something, your teacher will see it in your work. Then, your teacher can give you more help with the topics you don’t understand.

Completing all of your work will also help you get a good grade in math. Even a few missed assignments can hurt your grade. In fifth grade, the most important thing is that you do your work. Teachers usually give you full credit for assignments if you try your best. If you don’t turn in your work at all, you won’t earn any points.


, A messy desk can cause you to lose your work. If you find an assignment in the back of your desk weeks after it was due, your teacher probably will not accept it. Keep all of your work for all subjects in separate folders.

You should have a folder that is just for math work. Keep your classwork and graded work in this folder.

You should also have a folder that is just for homework. When you complete your homework, put it in your homework folder. Put your homework folder in your bookbag right away. This way, you won’t forget to take it to school the next day.

Ask your teachers.,
Look online.,
Get a tutor.",How to Pass Fifth Grade Math4," Don’t be afraid to raise your hand if you don’t understand something. Your teachers are there to help you! If you think you need extra help, see if your teachers will work with you before or after school. They might also be able to give you extra practice work.

Teachers are very busy. Even if your teacher does not have extra time to help you, don't get upset. Ask your teacher if you can work with a partner who can help you learn the topics you are struggling with.

Try to be specific when you ask for help. For example, don't say, ""I don't get fractions."" Instead, ask, ""Can you explain again how to change fractions so they have the same denominator?"" If the teacher knows that you have a specific problem, it will be easier to take the time to stop and help.


, There are a lot of websites that help teach math. Some of them have written lessons. Others have video lectures. It might be helpful to look at these web sites with your parents, or an older brother or sister. They can help you find the math topics you are working on in class.

Some good sites with written lessons are Cool Mathand Math is Fun.A very popular site with videos is Khan Academy., You might be able to get a tutor through your school, so talk to your teacher. Your parents can also take you to a tutoring center, like Sylvan or Huntington. Or, you could get a personal tutor. A personal tutor works with your teacher and parents to give you one-on-one help.

Your parents can find you a tutor through websites like WyzAntor Varsity Tutors. Most tutors will meet with you in person, but you can also find a tutor who will work with you online through the computer.

Focus on mastering one thing before moving to the next.,
Practice your math skills in everyday life.,
Practice math more formally.,
Try to understand the process.,
Ask questions.",How to Overcome Math Anxiety2," You may have a number of mathematical functions you need to learn, but take your time on each step. Focusing on each portion individually will make them easier to grasp and allow you to master skills without confusing things with additional variables.Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Math is like learning to read; you have to learn the sounds letters make before you can form words. Focus on learning each step, instead of the overall concept.
If you need more help with a certain subject, don’t be afraid to ask your teacher or research it online. Math skills compound, so mastering one aspect will improve your ability for the next one.

, The more you do math, the more comfortable you will be with it. Do some practice math with yourself when there’s no pressure. Once you become more comfortable with doing math on your own, it will be that much easier to transition into doing math at school or work.Do addition and subtraction at the grocery store as you add or remove items from your cart. Try to keep a running tally of your total.
If you are purchasing more than one of the same item, practice multiplication by determining the total for all of them.
Use the clock to work on fractions. Split an hour into fractions: fifteen minutes is ¼ of an hour, thirty minutes is ½. Try to think of periods of time in fractions to better master how they relate to each other.

, It might not sound very exciting, but giving yourself practice problems to solve at home can be a huge help to improving your math skills. Just like in sports, math takes practice to excel.Find math problems that are at the level you need to learn online or from your text book and practice working through them.
If you can find ones that also provide the answer, check your work to ensure you are practicing the right skills.
If the answer is not provided, ask a friend, teacher or parent to look over your work.

, Simply memorizing formulas or how to complete a math problem doesn’t always make you good at math. Having an understanding of why you use an equation will make remembering it easier and help you to solve complex problems.Memorizing formulas and equations is just the surface level of math, the important thing to learn is what those equations and formulas do and why.
You could forget memorized information, but understanding the logic behind the math you are doing will help you work problems out even if you aren’t sure about the right way to complete them.

, There are many people you can ask for assistance in learning and understanding math. If you aren’t sure about something, ask about it. Your teachers and coworkers can be a great resource in helping you to better grasp complex mathematical concepts when you’re unsure.


If you are in school, ask your math teacher when you aren’t sure about something. Let them know if you need additional help and see if they can work with you one on one.
If you are at work, ask a coworker or friend for help solving a problem. People are often happy to help and excited to share something they understand with a friend.
Look for help online if you aren’t sure where else to look. There are many websites that provide tutorials that may explain mathematical concepts in a way you understand and appreciate more.

Start with small problems.,
Cooperate with groups.,
Play math games to find the fun in math.,
Buckle down and get through it.,
Treat yourself well to ease stress.,
Keep a positive attitude.",How to Overcome Math Anxiety3," If you find yourself in class or at work and experiencing math anxiety, start by writing down a shorter, simpler problem and solving that. To draw another parallel to sports, think of it as taking a few practice swings before getting up to bat. Get your body warmed up for the task at hand.Solving a simpler problem can help you shift gears into a mathematical mindset.
With a few shorter problems solved properly, your confidence will increase and allow you to take on harder problems.

, Working with friends is a great way to overcome your anxiety. By putting your heads together, each member of the group can learn from one another. Working in groups has been shown to help people overcome more complex problems that they could have on their own.Groups give you an opportunity to exchange ideas and ask questions frequently without feeling singled out.
Working in groups increases confidence and reduces anxiety during the learning process., Playing math based games like Sudoku or KenKen can be a great way to help you learn to enjoy math while improving your skills and understanding. There are lots of free math based games you can play online and many more books and magazines available at your local bookstore.The anxiety you experience when presented with a math problem may not be present when you come across it in a recreational setting.
Mathematical games like Sudoku have been found to have many cognitive benefits as well as helping to ease math anxiety.

, Studies show that one of the most effective ways to overcome math anxiety is to force yourself to begin working. Even if sitting down at your desk and forcing yourself to dig into your text book seems awful, the mere act could help you get past the negative mindset you have about math.Being nervous about doing math has no relation to student’s success at doing math itself. Just being nervous doesn’t mean you’ll do poorly.
Overcoming math anxiety has little to do with knowing how to do the math in question, and much more to do with being willing to dig into it.
You must practice this prior to high-stakes situations like exams in order to make it the most effective.

, Math anxiety and stress can present itself with physical symptoms just like any other form of stress. Taking good care of your body can help alleviate the worst aspects of your math anxiety and help you feel more at ease with getting through it.


If you begin to feel overwhelmed, take a timeout to regain control.Eat well and get enough sleep. Being hungry or tired can make feelings of stress and anxiety worse. Being well fed and rested will make approaching math easier.
Accept that you can’t control everything and that you’ll make mistakes. There’s nothing wrong with getting a math problem wrong, just try to learn from your mistakes.

, Math may be intimidating, but with a positive mindset you can overcome your anxiety and frustration. Changing the way you think about math can have a huge effect on how you actually feel about it.


Make an effort to identify negative or non-productive thoughts and replace them with positive onesVisualize yourself accomplishing your school or professional goals and mastering the math techniques that you struggle with. This will ease your stress and help you relax.Believing in yourself has been proven to improve performance in things like mathematics. Accept that you need to put in effort, but believe that you can."

Start right away.",How to Get a Last Minute Passing Grade on a Mathematics Exam," Never even dream of missing a test completely just because you don't know anything - even 5% is worth something and it's an experience in doing an exam. Who knows, you might even get a pass!;
, If you're not sure, ask! Don't be afraid that people will be horrified at how little you know, they might understand, as most people have been through this situation. Ask a teacher or preferably other students for notes, even if it is very late, for important exams; it is perfectly normal for people to still be going over, checking and in some cases relearning the material, even on the day of the exam, so chances are they won't figure out how little you actually know.

, Learn formulas and get an idea of how to apply them. It always looks impressive if you have the formulas spot on and make some confused steps towards the outcome. It's subjective what a good step and a poor/clueless step is in mathematics, and that definitely may earn you a pass, if you know how to do your thing.

, It may be tempting to stay up all night and revise but if you're tired, your brain won't function properly. If you get a good night of sleep, your brain will be alert and you will probably find you know far more than you realized. Eat a good meal before you go out too!

, Spend 70-90% of the time trying to come to grips with the methods and reading over the formulas. Obviously, you might want to forget about understanding it at this stage - understanding was what the other students did during the year, what you're hoping for is that you can somehow get away without doing any of that. However, understanding why something works has it's advantages as, while memory can let you down, true understanding of something won't. This really depends on your ability to understand or memorize things - pick what suits you the best.

, Spend right up until the very last second continually visualizing and repeating the stuff you feel is most important to know in your head. As much of it as you can. Just visualize and try to be able to understand/memorize it. Think about the problems you might encounter as well, to feel prepared.

, Go straight into the exam hall and if it looks like you might be able to, start writing on the exam script before the exam paper is received and the exam starts. You probably won't have very long, but you if you can just get those images, and especially the nasty equations, you have in your head down it'll save you so much time and mental energy later, when all you have to do, is go back to the first page and copy them. That's what you want - loads and loads of stuff in your temporary memory.

Challenge yourself.,
Don't be afraid to reach for a calculator to check your answer if you're unsure.",How to Improve Maths Calculation Skill," Don't jump straight in there trying to work out what '235 x 958.7' equals, if you can do that you don't need to read this. Start with easier addition and subtraction questions, even if it is patronizing, make sure you can do them quickly.;
, Knowing the patterns will make multiplication and division of larger numbers much simpler. Repeat these until you can recite them backwards and randomly at any time. Write up to the 12 times table every day once.

, Whether you imagine writing the sum out, or count objects, visualizing the calculation can make it easier to solve.

, Learn to count to 99 on your fingers and then use this to ""store"" the numbers so you don't worry about forgetting about it while calculating a different part of the calculation.

, There are a lot of these and they can make calculations much easier. Look on the internet or ask your teacher to see if there are any shortcut methods for the calculation (or part of the calculation) you are trying to do. Use the formulae and identities to speed up your work.

, Give yourself a few calculations to do each day, starting easy and gradually getting harder.

, It will take the time to get good at calculations. Persevere and don't reach for the calculator too soon.

, Once you can do the basics quickly and easily give yourself challenges. Stretch your abilities and aim to do the calculations as quickly and accurately as possible.

, There are very few non-exam/school situations where you will be required to work without a calculator and if you find you're getting them right this will help build confidence.

Add some color.",How to Draw a Histogram1," These are the vertical and horizontal lines that form basic outline of the histogram. If you have trouble making the right angle where the axes meet, go ahead and cheat: use a corner of a sheet of paper!;
, In a histogram, the data is visualized in groups. These groups are evenly distributed, so you'll need to make set marks along your lower axis.


For example: 0-4 apples, 5-9 apples, 10-14 apples, etc at 1"", 2"", and 3"" along the axis.

, The vertical axis in a histogram is always for frequency. What measure of time is necessary, though, is up to your data of course (but the numbers will still need to be equally spaced). Just be sure to leave extra room at the top to make your chart easier to read.


If the upper limit of your histogram is 54, for example, you should make the highest number on the axis 60.
If the frequency doesn't start until a fairly high number, you can cut out many of the numbers below it. For example, if the first frequency is 32, you can start the chart at 25 or 30.

, Draw the horizontal top line for each interval or group lightly, at the level that data was measured. Then, draw in the bars centered over the data point they represent. Make sure the bars are even and the same width as each other. Generally, histogram bars are supposed to touch, but if you have no results for a particular group, then don't worry about it.

, Add different colors to the histogram rectangles with colored pencils, markers, or crayons to help differentiate among the intervals.

Start your day out right.,
Replace negative self-statements with positive ones.,
Use effective test-taking techniques.",How to Get Good Grades in Math," One of the best ways to improve your chances of success is to show up for class on time every day. This will help ensure that you learn the material, turn in your assignments, and have the opportunity to ask your instructor about anything you're unclear on.Students who miss a lot of class are statistically less likely to perform well in that class.
If you absolutely must miss class due to an emergency, make sure you borrow someone's notes and go over everything you missed.
Your instructor will notice that you're absent or tardy a lot. You might lose points or even fail the class if you receive too many missed classes or late entries.
In addition, showing up to class on time every time shows your instructor that you're serious. If you're struggling and you come to class every day, your instructor may be more willing to help you work through whatever you're not understanding.;
, You can't realistically notate every single thing that gets said during a math lecture. There's so much back-and-forth between the teacher and the students, and a lot of time is devoted to solving problems on the board. Rather than trying to capture every word on paper, focus on the parts of the lecture that will help you the most when you're at home studying.Come to class having read the material that will be covered.
Focus your note-taking efforts on any material that you're not familiar with or that you find confusing.
Ask questions if you're unclear about anything in the material or anything from the previous night's homework.

, Any problems your instructor takes the time to write out on the board are probably very important. These problems are likely based on the ones you'll need to solve on the exam. Some problems solved in class may even be taken directly from the exam.Cover up the answer at home and rewrite the problem on a blank sheet of scrap paper. Try to solve the problem without checking the solution until you've answered it.
If you're having a hard time with the sample problems from class, you'll probably struggle with the homework and tests.
Talk to your instructor about what you're doing wrong, and bring your papers to show how you attempted to solve it at home so he or she can tell where you went wrong.

, In addition to the problems your instructor puts on the board, you should pay close attention to anything that will need to get memorized.Most math problems require you to work through an equation, but some equations depend on your knowledge of various components. At the very least, you should be writing down and memorizing any of the following that your instructor discusses:


definitions
theorems
formulas
derivatives
any other information that you'll need to remember in order to solve a given equation

, The best way to avoid falling behind is to talk to your instructor as soon as you realize that you need help. Most math courses build progressively off of material that was established earlier in the course, so if you don't understand something this week, you probably won't understand much material in the coming weeks either.Ask your instructor if you can meet after class. If not, you may have to schedule office hours.
You can also try emailing your instructor to let him/her know that you need some help and would like to set up a meeting. Keep your emails professional and polite and your professor will almost certainly make time for you.

, You cannot study for math the day before an exam. You need time to understand the concepts learned in your math class and to learn how to solve the equations you'll need to do. Spend some time every day, or at least every class day, reviewing your notes, going over quizzes, and reading material from the textbook.Some experts recommend spending three hours studying for every one hour of class time. This is a very effective way to reinforce the material that you learned in class.
If you study the day you had class, the information will be fresher in your mind. You'll also be able to stay on top of the work more easily.
Remember that there is only so much your instructor can help you with. It is ultimately your responsibility to learn the material, test yourself, and ensure that you understand it., Because math can be very complex, the textbooks you use in class tend to be very dense. It's often difficult to understand all the material after just one read through the chapter. Reread it as many times as necessary and test your knowledge by solving problems without looking at your notes or textbook.Go through the chapter summaries (if your textbook has them) at the end of each section.
You should understand the material well enough that you could write a few sentences about each concept without checking your notes or the book.
If you cannot do that yet, go back and review any material that you're still struggling with.

, Part of your regular study sessions at home should include doing practice problems. You may not have to turn them in, but practice problems can help you test your understanding of a concept or a formula before you discuss the homework and the assigned reading in class.If the practice problems are part of an assigned chapter, there's a chance that those problems could appear on a test or quiz.
If nothing else, you'll get a chance to review the material you've learned as you complete the practice questions.

, Any time you turn in an assignment to your instructor, you should always show all of your work. It's not enough to get the answer right, and getting the right answer won't prove anything if your textbook has an answer key in the back. Showing your work lets your instructor know that you've spent time studying and doing the assignments, and that you either understand the concept or you don't.Never write out the answer without showing your work, unless you write a separate solution sheet and attach it to the paper that shows your work.
Your instructor won't need to know every single addition and subtraction, for example. But you'll need to prove to your instructor that you can solve the equations and get the correct solution.
When in doubt about how much of your work to show, imagine that you were writing out your work for another student in the class. Your professor obviously knows the material, but another student would need to see how some of the steps are done.

, A good way to prepare for the next day's class at home is by reading ahead and trying your hand at advanced problems. You may not get them right, and that's okay. You'll know what aspects of those equations you struggle with and can work on them accordingly.Read ahead if you know the next section your instructor will be covering.
Try your hand at some problems from that section. Take notes on any part you find confusing/unclear.
During your next class, you can ask your instructor about the problems that were confusing for you. You can also ask about any other part of the material that was unclear.

, Any time you sit down to study for an upcoming quiz or exam, you should go over previous homework and quiz assignments as part of your study plan. Spend extra time working through problems you got wrong or only received partial credit on, and make sure you understand how to do them correctly this time around.The material covered on your homework and quizzes is likely based on the material that will be on the test.
Make sure you understand how to solve the equations from your previous assignments forward and backward. This should be a large part of your exam preparation.

, Working with other students can help you motivate one another and bounce ideas off of each other. If there's some concept that you're struggling with, someone in your study group can probably help explain it to you, and vice versa.Keep your group small so that you can all stay focused. One to three other students is plenty.
Make sure the students you choose for your study group are similarly dedicated to doing well in the class. Don't just choose your friends; go with students who can help you work through difficult equations.

, Never try to cram for a test. It doesn't work with most subjects, and it definitely won't work for math.It's generally best to err on the side of caution and give yourself more time than you think you'll need. That way if you get through everything and have a few extra days, you can spend that time reviewing the harder material a little more.


Start memorizing everything you'll need to know for the test (definitions, formulas, etc.) at least a few days, but ideally a week, before the actual test.
You can use flash cards to memorize definitions, formulas, and theorems, then quiz yourself.
Study in a place that is free of distractions. You'll need to be able to get through your work uninterrupted, so a library or coffee shop might be better than your dorm room or bedroom.

, If you've been keeping on top of the assignments all semester, you probably won't need to review everything equally. Some material will come easier to you, while other concepts and equations may be very difficult. You can study more effectively by reviewing the material you're already comfortable with and then buckling down for an intense study session on the material that you're struggling with.Make two separate lists of hard problems and easy problems. The easy problems should be reviewed, but they won't require as much time as the hard problems.
Take a practice test, if you have one. Set a timer for however long you'll have for the real test, and see if you can complete the test and do well on it within that timed period.
Any problems you get wrong or that you don't finish before the time is up should be added to your list of hard problems.

, How you start out your day before taking an exam can have a big impact on how you feel. If you're tired, hungry, or anxious, you won't be able to focus on the problems as clearly as you would if you didn't have those distractions. Start your day out right, get to class early, and make sure you're prepared. Bring scrap paper, pencils/pens, and a calculator (if you're allowed to have one for the test).Make sure you get a good night's sleep the night before a test. You'll want to be well-rested and refreshed before the exam.
Don't bother trying to review your material the morning of the test, as this will only stress you out more. Go into class knowing that you've spent many days preparing and you're ready to take the exam.
Try to avoid caffeine and refined sugar before the test, if at all possible. Both can make you ""crash,"" and caffeine can make you anxious.
Eat a well-balanced breakfast the morning of the exam.
Try going for a walk, run, or bike ride shortly before the exam, as this can help relieve stress and anxiety. Just make sure you'll have enough time to change and get to class.

, As you work through the exam, you may find yourself doubting your abilities. You may even find yourself worrying that you haven't prepared enough, or thinking that you should have done things differently. This type of thinking can seriously affect your ability to take the test, so try to be aware of what you're thinking and how you're feeling.Try to catch yourself when negative self-statements arise in your mind. Common negative self-statements include thoughts like, ""I don't understand this"" or ""I wish I had spent more time studying.""
Instead, try to force yourself to think positive self-statements.
Positive self-statements include thoughts like, ""I am calm and confident. I know I can do this.""
Focus on taking the test in the here and now. Try to drown out any thoughts about what you could have done differently in the past or how things may or may not turn out in the future.

, Just as you used techniques to study more effectively, you can also use techniques to take your test more effectively. Pace yourself, be aware of the time remaining, and don't sacrifice parts of the exam you might excel at for a question that you may never figure out in time.Prioritize the questions on your test. Make sure you get through the problems that are worth the most points first.
If you're having a hard time with a problem, skip it and return to it later.
Keep your eye on the clock and know how much time you have remaining.Write out some work on every problem, even if you can't solve for the solution. You may at least get partial credit for showing some of your work.
If you have time remaining after you finish, review your work. Make sure all answers make sense and that you didn't leave any questions blank or incomplete before turning in your test.

Find a notebook or two.,
Pay attention.,
Do your homework on time.,
Practice a lot.,
Study all theorems.,
Don't be afraid to ask for help.",How to Get an A+ in Advanced Math," (These need to be lined and graphing, depending on your grade). Dedicate these strictly to math. No tearing out pages to use for something else, or using the same notebook for 3 classes. This is advanced, your teacher will probably make you show your work, and you'll need all the help you can get. Also have a folder for math, you don't want to lose any worksheets or important papers.;
, It may seem obvious, but pay attention, don't turn and talk to your friend, don't zone out, you'll regret it later. Every chapter/section builds off of what you learned before, if you fall behind, catch up immediately. Be sure to take notes and give examples of the math problems so you can refers to them later, and that includes writing vocabulary words.


Pay close attention to what the teacher is writing and saying. Most likely, your teacher usually explains each step as he/she writes it.

, Don't let the homework pile up then do it all in one night. Doing a couple of problems a night is much easier, less stressful, plus you'll learn more and do better in class.


Look back on past material. This could jog your memory and make concepts in future classes easier to comprehend.
Watch a video of those same lessons described in class on the web. Resources like khanacademy.com, youtube.com, patrickjmt.com can be very valuable resources.

, Practicing will familiarize you with the types of problems you will be tested on later. While practicing, you should look for significantly more challenging problems on the web to assure that you have at least attained a good handle on the concept(s) in practice.

, Know them like the back of your hand. A lot of times, these theorems can help you solve problems a lot faster which will be a great on a test.

, If you need help on a single problem, or don't understand the lesson ask a friend, or better yet the teacher. And if you got a problem wrong on your homework and don't see your mistake, simply raise your hand and ask the teacher to go over it. Asking for help is probably one of the most important things you can do.


There are many teachers, tutors, and outside resources you can access to give you that boost. Use them.

Go to class.,
Sit in the front row and participate in class.,
Do your homework.,
Ask questions.,
Review before the test.,
Relax.,
Pace yourself.,
Pay attention to neatness.,
Check your work.",How to Get a Good Grade on a Math Test," While you can get away with skipping class in some subjects, math is like a ladder. If a rung is missing, or if you don't get a good grip on it, you'll struggle to reach the next rung. If enough rungs are missing, it will be impossible to climb higher. In addition, teachers often emphasize the most important topics in class, so come test time you'll know exactly what to study.;
, By sitting in the front row, distractions are minimized and performance heightened. Asking questions or providing answers helps the student to stay engaged in the learning process, this improving attentiveness and retention of materials learned.

, Homework may seem like torture, but it's really designed to help you learn. The key to learning math is repetition: do enough problems with the quadratic formula, and you'll eventually be able to recite it in your sleep. Plus, as you do your homework, you'll be able to identify concepts you don't understand. It also doesn't hurt that test questions are often based on the homework assignments.

, OK, so you did your homework, but you still don't understand how to factor a polynomial. Go ahead and ask your teacher, TA, professor--even other students may be able to help. There's no such thing as a stupid question, and if you think it's embarrassing to ask a question imagine how you'll feel when you get a big red ""F"" on the exam. Everybody has questions about math; successful students ask theirs.One of the most important skills for mastering a math test, along with any test, is to have a strong understanding of the material. Asking questions can greatly help your understanding, but if you are really struggling, you should take some time to meet with your teacher. Ask your teacher if they can meet with you during a free period to take the time to explain the topic to you so that you are able to master it on the test.

, Good job! You went to class, did your homework, and got your questions answered. Now, the test is tomorrow. Do you a) breathe a sigh of relief and go to bed; b) turn on the TV and watch The Simpsons; or c) review what you've learned? That's right, it's time to review. This is not the time for cramming, however; you're better prepared than that anyway. Go over your notes, take practice tests, and make sure you have important formulas memorized. Of course, you could just watch The Simpsons, but don't be surprised if your grades turn out more like Bart's than like Lisa's!

, Make sure you get a good night's sleep the night before the test. You'll feel better and think more clearly if you're well rested. Right before taking your test, look over the important formulas one last time, but other than that, you're done preparing. Remember, you're ready for this, and no matter what happens it's not the end of the world. Studies have found that chewing gum helps with focus,and therefore potentially your performance on a test. So try chewing gum, if your school allows it, of course.

, Once you have your exam in front of you, look it over to see how many questions there are and what kind of questions are included. This will give you an idea of how much time you can spend on each problem. If you get stuck on a question, move on to the next one and come back later. Sometimes a later question will even jog your memory so that you can answer the one you skipped. Most importantly, don't rush yourself.

, Any math teacher will tell you that sloppy work is the test-taker's worst enemy. Even if you know the material cold, a smudged digit here or a forgotten negative sign there can ruin an entire problem. If you make a mistake, use your eraser--that's what it's there for.

, Great, you finished the test with plenty of time. Don't turn it in yet, though! Good test-takers make mistakes all the time, but they find them and fix them before they hand in their exams. I can't stress this enough - you will always find a mistake somewhere. Anyway, depending on what kind of problems you're doing, your teacher will probably give you some hints on how to check your work. In general, though, carefully reread each question and ask yourself if your answers make sense. You still may not get every problem right, but you'll increase your chances of success exponentially.

Something may have happened that you don’t know about Talk to them about their worries surrounding math. Go through their worries one by one to see what you can do to help.For instance, one of your child’s worries might be that if they get an answer wrong, their teacher will think they are stupid. Tell your child that students get questions wrong all the time and that teachers are there to help.;
, One way to help a child overcome their math anxiety is to give them some additional training in the subject. The child might be struggling to grasp the concepts in the classroom, but with a bit of outside help, they might be able to perform well.Sign them up for some after school tutoring. One on one is best, when possible. If you are their parent, you can also work with them individually after school.

, The student might be experiencing anxiety because they don’t feel that they have any information on how to complete the math they are assigned. Many schools don’t allow students to bring home their textbooks, so your child might feel lost. Encourage them to take notes in class and to copy down any necessary formulas or tips that their teacher shares. They can use these to study before an exam or while completing homework.Even when they don’t have a test or homework, encourage them to review their notes daily.

, When they become stressed, teach them how to breathe deeply. This will help to calm them down they they feel overwhelmed. Many mistakes are made on math problems when students are frustrated or trying to rush. Talk to them about the importance of pacing themselves., When tutoring or teaching a child, do not move on to the next lesson until they have successfully grasped the first. If you are a teacher, you might need to give the student some one on one time after class to keep them caught up so that the class as a whole doesn’t have to move at a slower pace.If you are their parent, don’t move on to the next problem until they fully understand the work they have just done.

, It is good to take breaks so that the student does not become agitated with math. If you sense that they are becoming overwhelmed, give them a five minute bathroom break. If possible, give them a snack or cup of water. Allow them to take a few minutes away from the subject to rest their minds.

, Though some students can learn from numbers on paper alone, others might need additional tools in order to get it. They might need visual aids or manipulatives likes blocks. Incorporate these into your lessons when possible to accomodate all types of learners., If you are their teacher, don’t say “Wrong!” when they provide an incorrect response to a problem. Instead, ask if anyone else got that answer. Find out who got different results from that student. You will often find that there are several wrong answers floating in the room. Then say “let’s figure it out together.” Help them grow past their mistakes and know that they are not the only person making them., Though testing is very important in today’s school systems, the ultimate objective should be to train students who are confident in and capable of doing math. Do not have pop quizzes often and avoid frequent testing. Focus instead on encouraging learning and application of knowledge.Assign take home tests when at all possible. Provide additional time to students when completing in-class assignments.
If you are a parent, don’t rush them to complete their homework. Do not make this time any more stressful for them.

Speak positively about math.,
Avoid spreading your own math anxiety to them.,
Study the material until you understand.,
Reinforce the importance of math.,
Make math fun.,
Provide incentives when they do well.",How to Help a Child with Math Anxiety2," Talk to them about how cool math is. Watch movies or read books that feature famous mathematicians, like “Hidden Figures.” Teaching them that math can be fun will help them feel less anxiety about it., Don’t make comments like “I’m not good at math, either.” This tells a child that they are not good at math and that you are not going to help them at all, both of which increase anxiety. Even if you are not confident, make comments like “We are going to figure this out together.”, If you are a parent attempting to ease your child’s math anxiety, take some time each day to learn the math that they are doing so that you can help them successfully. Contact their teacher to find out what they will be learning each week so you can review it ahead of your child., Math is used when shopping, cooking, calculating time, and in so many other daily activities. Though the math your child is learning right now might not seem to have much real world application, explain to them that they will never know when they will need to use that particular form of math., Incorporate jokes, games, cartoon characters, or animals into homework sheets, if you are teacher. You can also do this if you are trying to provide your child with some additional assistance. Use brightly colored paper or pencils. Find fun computer math games or apps they can download to their phone. Talk to older children about how flexible and interesting math can be. Talk about all the cool things math has allowed us to do, like travel to the moon.

, When your child shows progress or hard work, reward them for it. Take them for ice cream or buy them something small that they’ve been wanting.


Don’t, however, promise things in advance to them. This might make them feel even more pressure to achieve.

, If you aren't opening a new document, skip this step.

, To do this, click on a cell into which you wish to input data, then type in your data.


Depending on the type of data you have, this process will vary. However, you should start all data in the ""A"" column.
For example: you might place your users' names in the ""A"" column and their responses to a survey (e.g., ""yes"" or ""no"") in the ""B"" column.

, Once you're positive that you've added all necessary data, you're ready to generate your random sample.

, For example, if all of your data begins in column ""A"", you'd right-click the ""A"" at the top of the page.

, This will add a column to the left of your current left column.


After doing this, any data that was in the ""A"" column will be relisted as being in the ""B"" column and so on.

,, Exclude the quotation marks. The ""RAND"" command applies a number between 0 and 1 to your selected cell.If Excel attempts to automatically format your ""RAND"" command, delete the formatting and re-type the command.

, You should see a decimal (e.g., 0.5647) appear in your selected cell.

,,


For a Mac, you'll hold down ⌘ Command instead of Control.
You can also right-click the ""RAND"" cell and then select Copy.

, This will likely be the ""A2"" cell.


Clicking the ""A1"" cell and highlighting from there can cause a sorting error.

, To do this, you'll hold down ⇧ Shift while clicking the cell at the bottom of your data range.


For example, if your data in columns ""B"" and ""C"" extends all the way down to cell 100, you would hold down shift and click ""A100"" to select all ""A"" cells from A2 to A100.

, Once this is done, you'll need to sort your data using the random numbers to reorder your results.


Again, Mac users will need to hold down ⌘ Command instead of Control.

, In most cases, this will be the ""A1"" cell. Before you can sort your sample, you'll need to highlight all of your data.


This includes the random sample numbers to the left of your data as well.

, Doing so will highlight all of your data, making it ready for sorting.


For example, if your data takes up two columns of 50 cells each, you would select ""C50"" while holding down ⇧ Shift.
You can also click and drag your cursor from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of your data (or vice versa) to highlight it.

, This will bring up a context menu with options that will allow you to sort your data.


If you're using a Mac, you can click using two fingers (or hold down Ctrl and click) to bring up the context menu.

,, You can also click Sort Largest to Smallest here--the only thing that matters is that your data is reorganized randomly according to the ""= RAND()"" values in the ""A"" column.

, Depending on how many results you need, your process from here will vary. However, you can do a couple of things with the sorted data:



Select the first, last, or middle half of the data. If your number of data points is too large to warrant this, you can also settle on a lower fraction (for example, the first eighth of the data).

Select all odd- or even-numbered data. For example, in a set of 10 data points, you would either pick numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, or 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

Select a number of random data points. This method works best for large sets of data where picking half of the information is too ambitious.

, Now you have a non-biased sample pool for a survey, product giveaway, or something similar.

, It is usually faster to multiply percentages with a calculator.

, You may want to write them down on your paper in a chart form.


For example, if you are trying to figure out a grade, you should identify what you were graded on each exam.

, This is often a percentage. List the weight next to the number.


Percentages are common because weights are often a percentage of a total of 100. If you are figuring out the weighted average of grades, investments and other financial data, look for the percentage of the occurrence out of 100.
If you are figuring the weighted average of grades, you should identify the weight of each exam or project.

, Always multiply decimals by decimals, instead of decimals by percentages.

,


You can choose to write this at the end of the chart or to do it on 1 line, in a formula. For example, if you are trying to figure out the weighted average of certain grades, you might write 0.9(0.25) to indicate a 90 percent grade times 25 percent of the total grade.

,


For example, 0.9(0.25) + 0.75(0.50) + 0.87(0.25). The total weighted score for the class would be 0.8175.

, Continue reading to adjust the weighted average for different types of weights.

, In our grade example, this is 81.75 percent.

Write your final answer.",How to Calculate Unit Rate," Unit rate is a special type of ratio in which the two separate measurements are compared and expressed as a quantity of one.A ""ratio"" is any comparison of two numerical measurements. Each measurement is called a ""term.""
A ""rate"" is a ratio in which the two terms are measured in different units. All rates are ratios, but not all rations are rates.
A ""unit rate"" is a rate in which the second term equals ""1."" When calculating a unit rate, you need to determine how much of the first term exists for every one unit of the second term.;
, The problem must have two terms, and you must be asked to determine how much of one term exists per unit of the other term.


Common examples include: speed (miles/kilometers per hour), unit price (cost per item), and wage (earnings per hour/week).If you aren't sure about whether or not you're being asked for the unit rate, look for the word ""per"" somewhere in the description. Some unit rate problems won't include ""per,"" but many do.

Example: A certain bakery can bake 40 loaves of bread in an 8 hour work day. How many loaves of bread can that same bakery make in one hour? In other words, how many loaves of bread are typically baked per hour?

, The first term in the problem—the amount you are trying to calculate per unit—will become the numerator (top number). The second term—the unit—will become the denominator (bottom number).



Example: You must calculate loaves of bread per unit of time (in this case, the unit of time is an hour). The total loaves of bread will become the numerator, and the total hours will become the denominator, giving you:

40 loaves / 8 hours



, To find the unit rate, simply solve the newly written division problem. Doing so will reduce the denominator to ""1.""Example: Divide the total number of loaves by the total number of hours: 40 loaves / 8 hours = 5 loaves/hours

, You should now have your final answer ready.


Make sure that you include both units in your answer. You can either separate the units with the fraction sign (/) or with the word ""per.""

Example: This bakery can bake 5 loaves/hour.

Alternatively, you could write, ""This bakery can bake 5 loaves per hour.”



, To calculate the unit price of any product, you will need to know how much money it will cost to buy a certain, set amount of that product. Use this information to calculate how many dollars (or other unit of currency) it will cost to purchase one unit of that product.


In other words, you are calculating the cost per item.

Example: Jennifer purchased 7 boxes of cereal for a total cost of $16.38 (without tax). Assuming each box of cereal cost the same amount of money, calculate the unit price on the cereal Jennifer purchased.

, Set up a fraction with the total cost as the numerator (top number) and the total number of items as the denominator (bottom number). Divide the total cost by the total number of items to reduce the denominator to a value of one.



Example: The total cost, $16.38, should be set as the numerator. The number of items, 7, should be set as the denominator. In other words, the cereal costs: $16.38 / 7 boxes

Treat the fraction as a division problem and solve: $16/38 / 7 boxes = $2.34 / box



, At this point, you should know the unit price of the product in question. Write the unit cost as an expression of cost per item.


Make sure that you include both unit labels in your answer.

Example: The price per box of cereal is $2.34.

Another way of writing this answer would be: The cost of the cereal is $2.34 / box.



, To calculate wage, you need to know how much money will be earned over a specific period of time. You can then use that information to determine how many dollars (or other unit of currency) will be earned per one unit of time.


Essentially, you calculating the cost per unit of time.
Note that the unit of time will vary depending on the circumstances. In many cases, the unit of time used will be the “hour.” In some cases, though, you may need to use “day,” “week,” “month,” or “year.”

Example: Robert worked 40 hours this week and earned $630.00 before taxes. Calculate Robert's wage as an expression of how much money Robert earns per hour.

, The total pay should be the numerator (top number) and the total amount of time should be the denominator (bottom number). Divide the numerator by the denominator to reduce that denominator to a value of one.



Example: Set the total pay, $630, as the numerator. Set the total number of hours, 40, as the denominator. You should have: $630 / 40 hours

Divide the fraction accordingly: $630 / 40 hours = $15.75 / hour



, You should now know the wage of the job in question. Write this down as an expression of cost per unit of time.


You must include both unit labels in your answer.

Example: Robert's earns a wage of $15.75 per hour.

, To calculate the speed of any moving object, you will need to know how much distance has been traveled over a certain period of time. From that data, you should be able to determine how many miles (or other measurement of distance) has been traveled per hour (or other unit of time).


In essence, you are calculating the distance per unit of time.

The units will vary depending on the circumstance, but one unit must express distance (mile, kilometer, feet, meters, etc.) and the other unit must express time (hours, minutes, seconds, etc.).

Example: The Smith family traveled 150 miles in 3 hours. If they drove the same speed during the entire trip, how fast did the Smith family car drive as an expression of miles per hour?

, Write the data you have in the form of a fraction. The distance should be set as the numerator (top number) and the amount of time should be set as the denominator (bottom number). Divide the distance by the time as indicated, reducing the denominator to one unit of time.



Example: Set the total number of miles, 150, as the numerator. Set the total number of hours, 3, as the denominator. This should give you a fraction of: 150 miles / 3 hours

Treat the fraction as a division problem: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles / hour



, Completing the previous step should tell you the speed of the object in question. Write the speed as an expression of distance per unit of time.


Make sure that both unit labels are included in your final answer.

Example: The Smith family drove their car at a speed of 50 miles per hour (miles/hour).

, To calculate the gas mileage of a motor vehicle, you will need to know how much distance the vehicle is capable of traveling on a certain amount of gasoline. Use that data to calculate how many miles (or other unit of distance) can be traveled per gallon (or other unit of volume) of gasoline.


This means that you'll be calculating the distance per volume of gasoline.

The units may vary based on circumstance, but one must express distance (usually miles or kilometers) and the other must express volume (usually gallons or liters).

Example: The Smith family's car needed 4.2 gallons of gasoline to drive a distance of 150 miles. Based on this information, determine the average gas mileage their vehicle is capable of as an expression of miles per gallon.

, Divide the numerator by the denominator, reducing the denominator to one unit of volume.



Example: The number of miles, 150, should be the numerator and the number of gallons, 4.2, should be the denominator. This means that: 150 miles / 4.2 gallons

Treat the fraction as a division problem and solve: 150 miles / 4.2 gallons = 35.7 miles / gallon



, The previous step should indicate the gas mileage of the vehicle in question. Write this mileage as an expression of distance per unit of volume.


Both unit labels must be included in the final answer.

Example: The Smith family's car gets an average gas mileage of 35.7 miles/gallon (miles per gallon).

Determine the number you are computing the factorial for.,
Write out the sequence of numbers to be multiplied.,
Multiply the numbers together.",How to Do Factorials1," A factorial is denoted by a positive integer and an exclamation point.

For example, if you need to compute the factorial for 5, you will see 5!{\displaystyle 5!}.
;
, A factorial is simply multiplying the natural numbers that descend sequentially from the factorial number, down to 1.Speaking formulaically, n!=n(n−1)⋅⋅⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle n!=n(n-1)\cdot \cdot \cdot 2\cdot 1}, where n{\displaystyle n} equals any positive integer.For example, if you are computing 5!{\displaystyle 5!}, you would compute 5(5−1)(5−2)(5−3)(5−4){\displaystyle 5(5-1)(5-2)(5-3)(5-4)} or, denoted more simply: 5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}.


, You can compute a factorial quickly using a scientific calculator, which should have a x!{\displaystyle x!} sign. If you are computing by hand, to make it easier, first look for pairs of factors that multiply to equal 10.Of course, you can also ignore the 1, since any number multiplied by 1 equals that number.

For example, if computing 5!=5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle 5!=5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}, disregard the 1, and first calculate 5⋅2=10{\displaystyle 5\cdot 2=10}. Now all you are left with is 4⋅3=12{\displaystyle 4\cdot 3=12}. Since 10⋅12=120{\displaystyle 10\cdot 12=120}, you know that 5!=120{\displaystyle 5!=120}.

Interpret your result.",How to Calculate the Standard Error of Estimate," Any statistical work is generally made easier by having your data in a concise format. A simple table serves this purpose very well. To calculate the standard error of estimate, you will be using five different measurements or calculations. Therefore, creating a five-column table is helpful. Label the five columns as follows:x{\displaystyle x}


y{\displaystyle y}


y′{\displaystyle y^{\prime }}


y−y′{\displaystyle y-y^{\prime }}


(y−y′)2{\displaystyle (y-y^{\prime })^{2}}

Note that the table shown in the image above performs the opposite subtractions, y′−y{\displaystyle y^{\prime }-y}. The more standard order, however, is y−y′{\displaystyle y-y^{\prime }}. Because the values in the final column are squared, the negative is not problematic and will not change the outcome. Nevertheless, you should recognize that the more standard calculation is y−y′{\displaystyle y-y^{\prime }}.
;
, After collecting your data, you will have pairs of data values. For these statistical calculations, the independent variable is labeled x{\displaystyle x} and the dependent, or resulting, variable is y{\displaystyle y}. Enter these values into the first two columns of your data table.

The order of the data and the pairing is important for these calculations. You need to be careful to keep your paired data points together in order.

For the sample calculations shown above, the data pairs are as follows:

(1,2)

(2,4)

(3,5)

(4,4)

(5,5)




, Using your data results, you will be able to calculate a regression line. This is also called a line of best fit or the least squares line. The calculation is tedious but can be done by hand. Alternatively, you can use a handheld graphing calculator or some online programs that will quickly calculate a best fit line using your data.For this article, it is assumed that you will have the regression line equation available or that it has been predicted by some prior means.

For the sample data set in the image above, the regression line is y′=0.6x+2.2{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=0.6x+2.2}.


, Using the equation of that line, you can calculate predicted y-values for each x-value in your study, or for other theoretical x-values that you did not measure.

Using the equation of the regression line, calculate or “predict” values of y′{\displaystyle y^{\prime }} for each value of x. Insert the x-value into the equation, and find the result for y′{\displaystyle y^{\prime }} as follows:


y′=0.6x+2.2{\displaystyle y^{\prime }=0.6x+2.2}


y′(1)=0.6(1)+2.2=2.8{\displaystyle y^{\prime }(1)=0.6(1)+2.2=2.8}


y′(2)=0.6(2)+2.2=3.4{\displaystyle y^{\prime }(2)=0.6(2)+2.2=3.4}


y′(3)=0.6(3)+2.2=4.0{\displaystyle y^{\prime }(3)=0.6(3)+2.2=4.0}


y′(4)=0.6(4)+2.2=4.6{\displaystyle y^{\prime }(4)=0.6(4)+2.2=4.6}


y′(5)=0.6(5)+2.2=5.2{\displaystyle y^{\prime }(5)=0.6(5)+2.2=5.2}




, In the fourth column of your data table, you will calculate and record the error of each predicted value. Specifically, subtract the predicted value (y′{\displaystyle y^{\prime }}) from the actual observed value (y{\displaystyle y}).For the data in the sample set, these calculations are as follows:


y(x)−y′(x){\displaystyle y(x)-y^{\prime }(x)}


y(1)−y′(1)=2−2.8=−0.8{\displaystyle y(1)-y^{\prime }(1)=2-2.8=-0.8}


y(2)−y′(2)=4−3.4=0.6{\displaystyle y(2)-y^{\prime }(2)=4-3.4=0.6}


y(3)−y′(3)=5−4=1{\displaystyle y(3)-y^{\prime }(3)=5-4=1}


y(4)−y′(4)=4−4.6=−0.6{\displaystyle y(4)-y^{\prime }(4)=4-4.6=-0.6}


y(5)−y′(5)=5−5.2=−0.2{\displaystyle y(5)-y^{\prime }(5)=5-5.2=-0.2}




, Take each value in the fourth column and square it by multiplying it by itself. Fill in these results in the final column of your data table.

For the sample data set, these calculations are as follows:


−0.82=0.64{\displaystyle -0.8^{2}=0.64}


0.62=0.36{\displaystyle 0.6^{2}=0.36}


12=1.0{\displaystyle 1^{2}=1.0}


−0.6=0.36{\displaystyle -0.6=0.36}


−0.2=0.04{\displaystyle -0.2=0.04}




, The statistical value known as the sum of squared errors (SSE) is a useful step in finding standard deviation, variance and other measurements. To find the SSE from your data table, add the values in the fifth column of your data table.For this sample data set, this calculation is as follows:


0.64+0.36+1.0+0.36+0.04=2.4{\displaystyle 0.64+0.36+1.0+0.36+0.04=2.4}




, The Standard Error of the Estimate is the square root of the average of the SSE. It is generally represented with the Greek letter σ{\displaystyle \sigma }. Therefore, the first calculation is to divide the SSE score by the number of measured data points. Then, find the square root of that result.If the measured data represents an entire population, then you will find the average by dividing by N, the number of data points. However, if you are working with a smaller sample set of the population, then substitute N-2 in the denominator.

For the sample data set in this article, we can assume that it is a sample set and not a population, just because there are only 5 data values. Therefore, calculate the Standard Error of the Estimate as follows:


σ=2.45−2{\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {\frac {2.4}{5-2}}}}


σ=2.43{\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {\frac {2.4}{3}}}}


σ=0.8{\displaystyle \sigma ={\sqrt {0.8}}}


σ=0.894{\displaystyle \sigma =0.894}




, The Standard Error of the Estimate is a statistical figure that tells you how well your measured data relates to a theoretical straight line, the line of regression. A score of 0 would mean a perfect match, that every measured data point fell directly on the line. Widely scattered data will have a much higher score.With this small sample set, the standard error score of 0.894 is quite low and represents well organized data results.

;
, To do this, simply count each number in the set. Don’t forget to count each instance of a repeated value.

For example, the set has 10 numbers.


, The formula is Q3=34(n+1){\displaystyle Q_{3}={\frac {3}{4}}(n+1)}, where Q3{\displaystyle Q_{3}} is the upper quartile, and n{\displaystyle n} is the number of numbers in the data set., Remember that n{\displaystyle n} is the number of numbers in the data set.

For example, if there are 10 numbers in your data set, your formula will look like this: Q3=34(10+1){\displaystyle Q_{3}={\frac {3}{4}}(10+1)}.


, According to the  order of operations, you must attend to the parentheses first when evaluating a mathematical expression. In this instance, add 1 to the number of numbers in the data set. 

For example:Q3=34(10+1){\displaystyle Q_{3}={\frac {3}{4}}(10+1)}Q3=34(11){\displaystyle Q_{3}={\frac {3}{4}}(11)}


, You could also multiply by .75{\displaystyle .75}. This will show you the placement of the value in the data set that is at the three-fourths, or 75 percent mark, and thus the place where the data set is split into the upper quartile and the lower quartiles. This will not give you the number of the upper quartile.For example:Q3=34(11){\displaystyle Q_{3}={\frac {3}{4}}(11)}Q3=814{\displaystyle Q_{3}=8{\frac {1}{4}}}So, the upper quartile is given by the number at the 814{\displaystyle 8{\frac {1}{4}}} position in the data set.


, If you calculated a whole number, simply find that number in the data set.

For example, if you calculated 12 using the formula, then the upper quartile is the 12th number in the data set. 


,  Usually, you will calculate a fraction or decimal using the formula. In this instance, find the value above and below this position in the data set, and find their mean, or average. To do this, divide the sum of the two values by 2. This will give you the upper quartile of your data set.For example, if you calculated 814{\displaystyle 8{\frac {1}{4}}} using the formula, then the upper quartile is between the 8th and 9th number in the data set. In the set , 11 and 12 are the 8th and 9th number. Calculate 11+122{\displaystyle {\frac {11+12}{2}}} to find the average:11+122{\displaystyle {\frac {11+12}{2}}}=232{\displaystyle ={\frac {23}{2}}}=11.5{\displaystyle =11.5}So, the upper quartile of the data set is 11.5


, Enter each value into a separate cell. Don’t forget to include any repeated values. You can enter your data in any cells in the spreadsheet.

For example, you might enter the data set into cells A1 through A10 in the spreadsheet.


, The quartile function is =(QUARTILE(AX:AY, Q)), where AX and AY is the data range, and Q is the quartile.Begin typing this function into Excel, then when it pops up in the menu, double-click on it to select.
, Select the first cell of the data range, then scroll down or across to select all the cells in the range. 
, Make sure you include a comma after the data range, and two closing parentheses.

For example, if you want to find the upper quartile of cells A1 through A10, your function will look like this: =(QUARTILE(A1:A10, 3)).


, To do this, hit enter after typing the function into Excel. This will show you the actual upper quartile, not the position of the quartile in the data set.

Note that with the release of Office 2010, there are two different quartile functions: QUARTILE.EXC and QUARTILE.INC. These functions cannot be used in earlier versions of Excel, and QUARTILE can still be used.

The two Excel quartile functions use a different formula to calculate the upper quartile. QUARTILE/QUARTILE.INC uses the formula Q3=34(n−1){\displaystyle Q_{3}={\frac {3}{4}}(n-1)}, and the QUARTILE.EXC function uses the formula Q3=34(n+1){\displaystyle Q_{3}={\frac {3}{4}}(n+1)}. Both formula are accepted ways to calculate quartiles, although the former is becoming standardized in statistical software."

Example: Write 5,827 in expanded form.

Read the number silently or out loud: five thousand, eight hundred twenty seven.
Notice that there are four separate digits in this number. As a result, there will be four separate places in the expanded form of this number.

;
, Rewrite the number so that each of its digits are separated by a plus sign. Leave a little room in between each digit and the plus sign that follows it. More information will need to be included there.



Example: The number 5,827 temporarily becomes:

5 + 8 + 2 + 7



, Each digit in your original number corresponds to a specific place value. Starting from the lowest digit, label each digit with its appropriate place value name.



Example: Since there are four digits in this number, you will need to count up four place values.

The smallest digit is 7, and that corresponds to the ones (1) place.
The next digit is 2, which corresponds to the tens (10) place.
The third digit is 8, which sits in the hundreds (100) place.
The fourth and final digit is 5, and it sits in the thousands (1000) place.



, Multiply each separate digit in your original number by the place value that matches where it belongs within the full, original number.



Example: + + + , Once the digits have been multiplied together, you should have the final expanded form of the original number.



Example: The expanded form of 5,827 is:

5000 + 800 + 20 + 7



, Read the number as it is written. When a number is in this form, you should be able to identify the full value of each separate digit.



Example: Write the following in expanded form: seven thousand two hundred eighty nine.

, Write each digit separately, attaching the appropriate place value name after it. The correct place value will simply be the one that is already written beside the value. Include plus signs in between each written value.


Note that the “tens” and “ones” place values are not specifically labeled, but they should be understood. You can indicate your understanding by marking the place value name in parentheses, but doing so is not strictly necessary.

Example: The number seven thousand two hundred eighty nine becomes:

seven thousand + two hundred + eighty (tens) + nine (ones)
OR
seven thousand + two hundred + eighty + nine



, Look at each separate value. Rewrite each value as it reads to the equal numeric value.



Example: Seven thousand + two hundred + eighty + nine:

Seven thousand = 7000
Two hundred = 200
Eighty = 80
Nine = 9



, You should have all the information you need now to write the original written form number in expanded form.



Example: The expanded form of seven thousand two hundred eighty nine is:

7000 + 200 + 80 + 9



, Read the number and count how many digits are in it, paying special attention to the digits that come after (to the right of) the decimal point.



Example: Write 531.94 in expanded form.
Read the number: five hundred thirty one and 94 hundredths.
Notice that there are three digits before the decimal point and two digits after the decimal point. There will be a total of five separate places in the expanded form of this number.

, Rewrite the number, separating each individual digit by a plus sign. For now, write the decimal point, too.


Note that the decimal point will eventually be removed, but you should keep it in place for now to prevent confusion while solving the problem.
Leave some space in between the digits and the plus signs. More information will need to be written there.

Example: The number 531.94 temporarily becomes:

5 + 3 + 1 + . + 9 + 4



, Label each digit with the place value name that matches its position in the original number.


When working before (to the left of) the decimal point, work from the lowest number to the highest.
When working after (to the right of) the decimal point, work from the highest number to the lowest.

Example: You will need to count three places to the left and two places to the right.

For the left values:
The smallest number is 1, which matches the ones (1) place.
The second number is 3, which matches the tens (10) place.
The largest number is 5, which sits in the hundreds (100) place.
For the right values:
The largest number is 9, which sits in the tenths (10) place.
The smallest number is 4, which sits in the hundredths (100) place.



, All of the digits on the left side of the decimal point must be multiplied by their matching place value. Do that now.



Example: + + = 500 + 30 + 1

, All of the digits on the right side of the decimal point must be divided by their matching place value. Do that now.



Example: + = 0.9 + 0.04

, Combine all of your rewritten values together, placing plus signs in between each one. Remove the decimal point. This will be your final answer.



Example: The expanded form of 531.94 is:

500 + 30 + 1 + 0.9 + 0.04



, Verify that you need to add together the expanded forms of two or more numbers. If the problem is written out in both words and numerals instead of numerals only, pull the numerals out of the problem and set them up in the addition format.


If you are given numbers in written form or standard form but need to show your work in expanded form, rewrite each number in expanded form before continuing.

Example: Add and together.

Rewrite the problem as: 500 + 30 + 6 + 80 + 2



, Identify all numbers in the ones place value, followed by all numbers in the tens place value, followed by all the numbers in the hundreds place value. Continue in this manner to identify all currently used place values. Rewrite the problem, arranging the various place values together.



Example: For 500 + 30 + 6 + 80 + 2:

Hundreds place value: 500
Tens place value: 30 + 80
Ones place value: 6 + 2



, Add up all of numbers in each place value category. Start with the ones place value and work your way up to the largest place value.


Note that if the sum of one place value exceeds the proper amount of digits within that place value category, you must add the extra digit to the place category above it.

Example: Start with the ones place value, followed by the tens, followed by the hundreds.

6 + 2 = 8
30 + 80 = 110; since this value exceeds the tens place category, you separate it into 100 + 10; keep the 10 here and add the 100 to the next place category as follows
500 + 100 = 600



, Arrange the sums of each category in a row, separating them with plus signs. This is the expanded form of your answer.


If you wanted to write the standard form of the answer, all you would need to do is add the digits together.

Example: 500 + 30 + 6 + 80 + 2 = 600 + 10 + 8

In standard form, the answer would be 618.



, Make sure that you are being told to subtract the expanded forms of two numbers. If the question is phrased as a word problem, pull the numerals out of the problem and arrange them in subtraction format.


Note that you should rewrite any numbers originally in standard or written form if the question explicitly tells you to show your work in expanded form.

Example: Subtract from .

Rewrite as: – Or: 800 + 10 + 4 – 500 – 70 - 1



, Identify all numbers falling into separate place value categories (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.). Rewrite the problem so that all numbers belonging to the same place value category are grouped together.



Example: For – :

Hundreds: 800 – 500
Tens: 10 – 70
Ones: 4 – 1



, Subtract the numbers in each place value category. Start with the lowest category (ones) and gradually work your way up to the highest.


If the number you are subtracting from is smaller than the number you must subtract from it, you will need to take an entire place value from the category above it. For instance, take “10” from the tens category if the values in the ones category cannot be subtracted as they are.

Example: Start with the ones category, followed by the tens, followed by the hundreds.

4 – 1 = 3
10 – 70; since “70” is larger than “10,” you'll need to take “100” from the “800” and add it to the “10,” making this equation: 110 – 70 = 40
700 – 500 = 200; the “800” became “700” when you took the “100” for the tens category



, Arrange the differences from each category in a row, separating them with plus signs. This is the expanded form of your final answer.


To find the standard form of this answer, all you need to do is add the digits of the expanded form together.

Example: – = 200 + 40 + 3

In standard form, the answer would be: 243

Create a three column table.,
Fill in the data.,
Calculate the mean.,
Calculate the individual error measurements.,
Calculate the squares of the errors.,
Add the squares of errors together.",How to Calculate the Sum of Squares for Error (SSE)1," The clearest way to calculate the sum of squared errors is begin with a three column table. Label the three columns as Value{\displaystyle {\text{Value}}}, Deviation{\displaystyle {\text{Deviation}}}, and Deviation2{\displaystyle {\text{Deviation}}^{2}}., The first column will hold the values of your measurements. Fill in the Value{\displaystyle {\text{Value}}} column with the values of your measurements. These may be the results of some experiment, a statistical study, or just data provided for a math problem.In this case, suppose you are working with some medical data and you have a list of the body temperatures of ten patients. The normal body temperature expected is 98.6 degrees. The temperatures of ten patients are measured and give the values 99.0, 98.6, 98.5, 101.1, 98.3, 98.6, 97.9, 98.4, 99.2, and 99.1. Write these values in the first column.


, Before you can calculate the error for each measurement, you must calculate the mean of the full data set.Recall that the mean of any data set is the sum of the values, divided by the number of values in the set. This can be represented symbolically, with the variable μ{\displaystyle \mu } representing the mean, as:


μ=Σxn{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\Sigma x}{n}}}



For this data, the mean is calculated as:


μ=99.0+98.6+98.5+101.1+98.3+98.6+97.9+98.4+99.2+99.110{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {99.0+98.6+98.5+101.1+98.3+98.6+97.9+98.4+99.2+99.1}{10}}}


μ=988.710{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {988.7}{10}}}


μ=98.87{\displaystyle \mu =98.87}




, In the second column of your table, you need to fill in the error measurements for each data value. The error is the difference between the measurement and the mean.For the given data set, subtract the mean, 98.87, from each measured value, and fill in the second column with the results. These ten calculations are as follows:


99.0−98.87=0.13{\displaystyle 99.0-98.87=0.13}


98.6−98.87=−0.27{\displaystyle 98.6-98.87=-0.27}


98.5−98.87=−0.37{\displaystyle 98.5-98.87=-0.37}


101.1−98.87=2.23{\displaystyle 101.1-98.87=2.23}


98.3−98.87=−0.57{\displaystyle 98.3-98.87=-0.57}


98.6−98.87=−0.27{\displaystyle 98.6-98.87=-0.27}


97.9−98.87=−0.97{\displaystyle 97.9-98.87=-0.97}


98.4−98.87=−0.47{\displaystyle 98.4-98.87=-0.47}


99.2−98.87=0.33{\displaystyle 99.2-98.87=0.33}


99.1−98.87=0.23{\displaystyle 99.1-98.87=0.23}




, In the third column of the table, find the square of each of the resulting values in the middle column. These represent the squares of the deviation from the mean for each measured value of data.For each value in the middle column, use your calculator and find the square. Record the results in the third column, as follows:


0.132=0.0169{\displaystyle 0.13^{2}=0.0169}


(−0.27)2=0.0729{\displaystyle (-0.27)^{2}=0.0729}


(−0.37)2=0.1369{\displaystyle (-0.37)^{2}=0.1369}


2.232=4.9729{\displaystyle 2.23^{2}=4.9729}


(−0.57)2=0.3249{\displaystyle (-0.57)^{2}=0.3249}


(−0.27)2=0.0729{\displaystyle (-0.27)^{2}=0.0729}


(−0.97)2=0.9409{\displaystyle (-0.97)^{2}=0.9409}


(−0.47)2=0.2209{\displaystyle (-0.47)^{2}=0.2209}


0.332=0.1089{\displaystyle 0.33^{2}=0.1089}


0.232=0.0529{\displaystyle 0.23^{2}=0.0529}




, The final step is to find the sum of the values in the third column. The desired result is the SSE, or the sum of squared errors.

For this data set, the SSE is calculated by adding together the ten values in the third column:


SSE=6.921{\displaystyle SSE=6.921}

Determine the expression you are simplifying.,
Write out the factors of each factorial.,
Cancel out any terms common to the numerator and denominator.This will simplify the numbers leftover that you need to multiply.,
Complete the calculations.",How to Do Factorials2," Often this will be stated as a fraction.

For example, you might need to simplify 7!5!⋅4!{\displaystyle {\frac {7!}{5!\cdot 4!}}}.


, Since the factorial n!{\displaystyle n!} is a factor of any factorial larger than it, to simplify, you need to look for factors that you can cancel out.This is easy to do if you write out each term.For example, if simplifying 7!5!⋅4!{\displaystyle {\frac {7!}{5!\cdot 4!}}}, rewrite as 1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5⋅6⋅7(1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5)⋅(1⋅2⋅3⋅4){\displaystyle {\frac {1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 6\cdot 7}{(1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5)\cdot (1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4)}}}


,

For example, since 5!{\displaystyle 5!} is a factor of 7!{\displaystyle 7!}, you can cancel out 5!{\displaystyle 5!} from the numerator and denominator:1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5⋅6⋅7(1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5)⋅(1⋅2⋅3⋅4)=6⋅7(1⋅2⋅3⋅4){\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5}}\cdot 6\cdot 7}{({\cancel {1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5}})\cdot (1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4)}}={\frac {6\cdot 7}{(1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4)}}}


, Simplify if possible. This will give you the final, simplified expression.

For example:6⋅7(1⋅2⋅3⋅4){\displaystyle {\frac {6\cdot 7}{(1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4)}}}=4224{\displaystyle ={\frac {42}{24}}}=74{\displaystyle ={\frac {7}{4}}}So, 7!5!⋅4!{\displaystyle {\frac {7!}{5!\cdot 4!}}} simplified is 74{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{4}}}.

Disregard the 1:8⋅7⋅6⋅5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle 8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2{\cancel {\cdot 1}}}

Pull out 5⋅2{\displaystyle 5\cdot 2}:(5⋅2)8⋅7⋅6⋅4⋅3{\displaystyle (5\cdot 2)8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 4\cdot 3}=(10)8⋅7⋅6⋅4⋅3{\displaystyle =(10)8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 4\cdot 3}

Cancel out terms common to the numerator and denominator:1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5⋅6⋅7⋅8⋅9⋅10⋅11⋅12(1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5⋅6)(1⋅2⋅3)=7⋅8⋅9⋅10⋅11⋅121⋅2⋅3{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 6\cdot }}7\cdot 8\cdot 9\cdot 10\cdot 11\cdot 12}{({\cancel {1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 6}})(1\cdot 2\cdot 3)}}={\frac {7\cdot 8\cdot 9\cdot 10\cdot 11\cdot 12}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3}}}

, You have 6 paintings you would like to display in a row on your wall. How many different ways can you order the paintings?

Since you are looking for different ways you can order objects, you can simply solve by finding the factorial for the number of objects.

The number of possible arrangements for 6 paintings hung in a row can be solved by finding 6!{\displaystyle 6!}.

If using a scientific calculator, hit the 6{\displaystyle 6} key, followed by the x!{\displaystyle x!} key.

If solving by hand, write out the factors to be multiplied:6⋅5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}

, You have 6 paintings. You would like to display 3 of them in a row on your wall. How many different ways can you order 3 of the paintings?

Since you have 6 different paintings, but you are only choosing 3 of them, you only need to multiply the first 3 numbers in the sequence for the factorial of 6. You can also use the formula n!(n−r)!{\displaystyle {\frac {n!}{(n-r)!}}}, where n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of objects you are choosing from, and r{\displaystyle r} equals the number of objects you are using. This formula only works if you have no repetitions (an object can’t be chosen more than once), and order does matter (that is, you want to find how many different ways things can be ordered).The number of possible arrangements for 3 paintings chosen from 6 and hung in a row can be solved by finding 6!(6−3)!{\displaystyle {\frac {6!}{(6-3)!}}}.

Subtract the numbers in the denominator:6!(6−3)!{\displaystyle {\frac {6!}{(6-3)!}}}=6!3!{\displaystyle ={\frac {6!}{3!}}}

Write the factors of each factorial:6⋅5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅13⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle {\frac {6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1}}}

Cancel out terms common to the numerator and denominator:6⋅5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅13⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle {\frac {6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot {\cancel {3\cdot 2\cdot 1}}}{\cancel {3\cdot 2\cdot 1}}}}

Complete the calculations: 6⋅5⋅4=120{\displaystyle 6\cdot 5\cdot 4=120}So, 3 paintings chosen from 6 can be ordered in 120 different ways if hung in a row.

Enter the function for the error measurements.,
Enter the function for the error squares.,
Copy the functions to fill the entire table.,
Find the SSE.",How to Calculate the Sum of Squares for Error (SSE)2," You will create a three column table in Excel, with the same three headings as above.

In cell A1, type in the heading “Value.”

In cell B1, enter the heading “Deviation.""

In cell C1, enter the heading “Deviation squared.”


, In the first column, you need to type in the values of your measurements. If the set is small, you can simply type them in by hand. If you have a large data set, you may need to copy and paste the data into the column.
, Excel has a function that will calculate the mean for you. In some vacant cell underneath your data table (it really doesn’t matter what cell you choose), enter the following:=Average(A2:___)

Do not actually type a blank space. Fill in that blank with the cell name of your last data point. For example, if you have 100 points of data, you will use the function:

=Average(A2:A101)

This function includes data from A2 through A101 because the top row contains the headings of the columns.



When you press Enter or when you click away to any other cell on the table, the mean of your data values will automatically fill the cell that you just programmed.


, In the first empty cell in the “Deviation” column, you need to enter a function to calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. To do this, you need to use the cell name where the mean resides. Let’s assume for now that you used cell A104.The function for the error calculation, which you enter into cell B2, will be:

=A2-$A$104.  The dollar signs are necessary to make sure that you lock in cell A104 for each calculation.




, In the third column, you can direct Excel to calculate the square that you need.In cell C2, enter the function

=B2^2




, After you have entered the functions in the top cell of each column, B2 and C2 respectively, you need to fill in the full table. You could retype the function in every line of the table, but this would take far too long. Use your mouse, highlight cells B2 and C2 together, and without letting go of the mouse button, drag down to the bottom cell of each column.

If we are assuming that you have 100 data points in your table, you will drag your mouse down to cells B101 and C101. 

When you then release the mouse button, the formulas will be copied into all the cells of the table. The table should be automatically populated with the calculated values.


, Column C of your table contains all the square-error values. The final step is to have Excel calculate the sum of these values.In a cell below the table, probably C102 for this example, enter the function:

=Sum(C2:C101)



When you click Enter or click away into any other cell of the table, you should have the SSE value for your data.

Calculate variance from SSE.,
Calculate standard deviation from SSE.,
Use SSE to measure covariance.",How to Calculate the Sum of Squares for Error (SSE)3," Finding the SSE for a data set is generally a building block to finding other, more useful, values. The first of these is variance. The variance is a measurement that indicates how much the measured data varies from the mean. It is actually the average of the squared differences from the mean.Because the SSE is the sum of the squared errors, you can find the average (which is the variance), just by dividing by the number of values. However, if you are calculating the variance of a sample set, rather than a full population, you will divide by (n-1) instead of n. Thus:

Variance = SSE/n, if you are calculating the variance of a full population.

Variance = SSE/(n-1), if you are calculating the variance of a sample set of data.



For the sample problem of the patients’ temperatures, we can assume that 10 patients represent only a sample set. Therefore, the variance would be calculated as:


Variance=SSE(n−1){\displaystyle {\text{Variance}}={\frac {\text{SSE}}{(n-1)}}}


Variance=6.9219{\displaystyle {\text{Variance}}={\frac {6.921}{9}}}


Variance=0.769{\displaystyle {\text{Variance}}=0.769}




, The standard deviation is a commonly used value that indicates how much the values of any data set deviate from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Recall that the variance is the average of the square error measurements.Therefore, after you calculate the SSE, you can find the standard deviation as follows:


Standard Deviation=SSEn−1{\displaystyle {\text{Standard Deviation}}={\sqrt {\frac {\text{SSE}}{n-1}}}}



For the data sample of the temperature measurements, you can find the standard deviation as follows:


Standard Deviation=SSEn−1{\displaystyle {\text{Standard Deviation}}={\sqrt {\frac {\text{SSE}}{n-1}}}}


Standard Deviation=6.9219{\displaystyle {\text{Standard Deviation}}={\sqrt {\frac {\text{6.921}}{9}}}}


Standard Deviation=.769{\displaystyle {\text{Standard Deviation}}={\sqrt {.769}}}


Standard Deviation=0.877{\displaystyle {\text{Standard Deviation}}=0.877}




, This article has focused on data sets that measure only a single value at a time. However, in many studies, you may be comparing two separate values. You would want to know how those two values relate to each other, not only to the mean of the data set. This value is the covariance.The calculations for covariance are too involved to detail here, other than to note that you will use the SSE for each data type and then compare them. For a more detailed description of covariance and the calculations involved, see Calculate Covariance.

As an example of the use of covariance, you might want to compare the ages of the patients in a medical study to the effectiveness of a drug in lowering fever temperatures. Then you would have one data set of ages and a second data set of temperatures. You would find the SSE for each data set, and then from there find the variance, standard deviations and covariance.

Example: 2,3,4,5,6.;
, You can use a calculator or a spreadsheet, or do it by hand if the set is simple enough.


Example: 2+3+4+5+6=20.

, If you have values that repeat in your set, each one still counts in determining your total.


Example: 2,3,4,5, and 6 make for a total of five values.

, The result is the mean, or average, of your set. This means that if each number in your set was the mean, they would add up to the same total.


Example: 20 ÷ 5 = 4

The alternative (research) hypothesis never contains an equality, and is the one you are trying to confirm. These two hypotheses are stated so that they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Mutually exclusive means that if one is true, the other must be false, and vice versa. Collectively exhaustive means that at least one of the outcomes must occur. Your hypotheses are formulated depending on whether it is 1- or 2-tailed:

One-tailed: Research question: Is one proportion greater than the other? Your hypotheses would be stated as follows: {H0:p^1≤p^2Ha:p^1>p^2{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}H_{0}:{\hat {p}}_{1}\leq {\hat {p}}_{2}\\H_{a}:{\hat {p}}_{1}>{\hat {p}}_{2}\end{cases}}}. Use one-tailed if you are interested in difference in one direction only. For example, for this example, we are interested only if the treatment works, that is, the proportion being greater in the treatment group. If we designate the treatment group as 1 and the control group as 2, the hypotheses are {H0:p^1≤p^2Ha:p^1>p^2{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}H_{0}:{\hat {p}}_{1}\leq {\hat {p}}_{2}\\H_{a}:{\hat {p}}_{1}>{\hat {p}}_{2}\end{cases}}}.

Two-tailed: Research question: Is the sample proportion different from the hypothesized population proportion? Your hypotheses would be stated as follows: {H0:p^=p0Ha:p^≠p0{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}H_{0}:{\hat {p}}=p_{0}\\H_{a}:{\hat {p}}\neq p_{0}\end{cases}}}.

If there is no a priori reason to believe that any difference is unidirectional, the two-tailed test is preferred as it is a more stringent test.


;
, ""alpha""). By definition, the alpha level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.Most commonly, alpha is set at 0.05, although any other values (between 0 and 1, exclusive) can be used instead. Other commonly used alpha values include 0.01 and 0.10.
, A proportion is the number of ""successes"" divided by the total sample in the group. In this example, {p^1=1820=0.9p^2=1520=0.75{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\hat {p}}_{1}={\frac {18}{20}}=0.9\\{\hat {p}}_{2}={\frac {15}{20}}=0.75\end{cases}}}.
, Overall sample proportion, p^{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}}, is the total number of ""successes"" divided by the total sample among all groups. Formula is p^=n1p^1+n2p^2n1+n2{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}={\frac {n_{1}{\hat {p}}_{1}+n_{2}{\hat {p}}_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}}}, where n1{\displaystyle n_{1}} and n2{\displaystyle n_{2}} are the sample sizes for groups 1 and 2, respectively. In this example, p^=18+1520+20=0.825{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}={\frac {18+15}{20+20}}=0.825}.
, The standard error, SE, is calculated as p^(1−p^)(1n1+1n2){\displaystyle {\sqrt {{\hat {p}}(1-{\hat {p}})\left({\frac {1}{n_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{n_{2}}}\right)}}}. In this example, SE=0.825(1−0.825)(120+120)=0.120156{\displaystyle SE={\sqrt {0.825(1-0.825)\left({\frac {1}{20}}+{\frac {1}{20}}\right)}}=0.120156}.
, The formula is z=p^1−p^2SE{\displaystyle z={\frac {{\hat {p}}_{1}-{\hat {p}}_{2}}{SE}}}. In this example, z=0.9−0.750.120156=1.248{\displaystyle z={\frac {0.9-0.75}{0.120156}}=1.248}.
, p-value is the probability that a randomly selected sample of n would have a sample statistic at least as different as the one obtained. p-value is the tail area under the normal curve in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. For example, if a right-tailed test is used, p value is the right-tailed area, or area to the right of the z value. If a two-tailed test is used, p-value is the area in both tails. p-value can be found using one of several methods:

Normal distribution probability z-table. Examples can be found on the web, such as this. It is important to read the table description to note what probability is listed by the table. Some tables list cumulative (left side) area, others list right tail area, still others list only area from mean up to a positive z value.

Excel. The excel function =norm.s.dist(z,cumulative). Substitute the numeric value for z and ""true"" for cumulative. This excel formula gives cumulative area to the left of a given z value. If you need the right tail area, subtract from 1.

In this example, we need the right tail area, so the p-value = 1-NORM.S.DIST(1.248,TRUE) = 0.106.

Online normal distribution calculators, such as this.


, If pvalue<α{\displaystyle p_{value}<\alpha }, reject H0{\displaystyle H_{0}}. Otherwise, fail to reject H0{\displaystyle H_{0}}. In this example, since pvalue=0.106{\displaystyle p_{value}=0.106} is greater than α=0.05{\displaystyle \alpha =0.05}, the experimenter fails to reject H0{\displaystyle H_{0}}.
, In this example, the experimenter fails to reject the null hypothesis and does not have sufficient evidence to support the claim that the treatment is efficacious. The proportion of people who got better on the treatment, 90%, is not significantly different from the proportion of people who got better on the placebo, 75%.
, The formula is Difference±Z∗SE{\displaystyle {\text{Difference}}\pm Z*SE}.

Choose a level of confidence. 95% is most commonly used, which corresponds to α=0.05{\displaystyle \alpha =0.05}.

Determine the z-score corresponding to the alpha level. Excel formula is =norm.s.inv(1 - alpha / 2). For α=0.05{\displaystyle \alpha =0.05}, we have z  = norm.s.inv(1-0.05/2) = 1.96.

Calculate the lower limit of the confidence interval as Difference−Z∗SE{\displaystyle {\text{Difference}}-Z*SE}. In this example, the lower limit is 0.15−1.96∗0.120156=−0.086{\displaystyle 0.15-1.96*0.120156=-0.086}.

Calculate the upper limit of the confidence interval as Difference−Z∗SE{\displaystyle {\text{Difference}}-Z*SE}. In this example, the lower limit is 0.15+1.96∗0.120156=0.386{\displaystyle 0.15+1.96*0.120156=0.386}.

Write the 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportion as 0.150±0.236{\displaystyle 0.150\pm 0.236}, or -0.086 to 0.386.

Interpret the result. In this case, we are 95% confident that the true proportion difference is -0.086 to 0.386. Since this range includes 0, there is insufficient evidence that the two proportions are different.

Set up the problem.,
Turn the whole number into a fraction.,
Multiply the numerators.,
Multiply the denominators.,
Simplify the fraction.",How to Work out a Fraction of an Amount1," When a problem asks you what a fraction of a whole number is, the problem is one of multiplication, and you need to multiply the fraction and the whole number. Look for the keyword of. When you see of in a word problem, you need to multiply.For example, if the problem asks, “What is 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294{\displaystyle 294},"" you need to set up 56×294{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}\times 294}.
;
, To do this, give it a denominator of 1. Remember, the denominator is the number underneath the fraction bar.

For example, you would change 294{\displaystyle 294} to 2941{\displaystyle {\frac {294}{1}}}. So the new problem becomes 56×2941{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}\times {\frac {294}{1}}}.


, Remember that the numerators are the numbers above the fraction bars.

For example, 5×294=1,470{\displaystyle 5\times 294=1,470}.


, Place this number under the product of the numerators.

For example, 6×1=6{\displaystyle 6\times 1=6}, so 56×2941=1,4706{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}\times {\frac {294}{1}}={\frac {1,470}{6}}}.


, To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator. This will give you your final answer as a whole number or in decimal form. If the result is not a whole number and you need the answer written in the form of a fraction, you should reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor. For complete instructions on how to reduce a fraction, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, 1,470÷6=245{\displaystyle 1,470\div 6=245}, so 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294=245{\displaystyle 294=245}.

Understand what the problem is asking.,
Determine the numerator and denominator.,
Simplify the fraction.",How to Work out a Fraction of an Amount2," When a problem asks you what fraction one whole number is of another whole number, you need to create a fraction and reduce it. Look for the key phrases “fraction of” or “out of.”For example, if the problem asks, “What fraction of 294{\displaystyle 294} is 245{\displaystyle 245},” you need to create a fraction from the two given whole numbers.


, The numerator is the fraction of the whole. Often this will be the smaller number, but not always, so read the problem carefully. The denominator is the “complete” number. Look for the key phrase “fraction of x{\displaystyle x}.” The x{\displaystyle x} variable will be the denominator.For example, if the problem asks, “What fraction of 294{\displaystyle 294} is 245{\displaystyle 245},” you know that 245{\displaystyle 245} is the numerator, because this is the number that is a part, or fraction, of 294{\displaystyle 294}. So the fraction is 245294{\displaystyle {\frac {245}{294}}}.


, To do this, find the greatest factor that is common to the numerator and the denominator, then divide each by that factor. For complete instructions on how to reduce fractions, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, the greatest common factor of 245{\displaystyle 245} and 294{\displaystyle 294} is 49{\displaystyle 49}:245÷49=5{\displaystyle 245\div 49=5}, so the reduced numerator is 5{\displaystyle 5}.294÷49=6{\displaystyle 294\div 49=6}, so the reduced denominator is 6{\displaystyle 6}.So, 245{\displaystyle 245} is 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294{\displaystyle 294}.

Simplify the fraction.,
Change the original amount by adding or subtracting the fractional amount.",How to Work out a Fraction of an Amount3," If the problem is asking you to determine how much of something is left, or to decrease an amount, or to find a discount, you will first multiply to find the fractional amount, then subtract the fractional amount from the original whole number. If the problem is asking you to determine how much of something there is after an increase, you will first multiply to find the fractional amount, then add the fractional amount to the original whole number.For example, a problem might ask, “If you have $294{\displaystyle \$294}, and you give 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of it away, how much money do you have left?” In this case, you will multiply, then subtract.


, To do this, turn the whole number into a fraction by placing it over a denominator of 1{\displaystyle 1}.

For example, to find 294×56{\displaystyle 294\times {\frac {5}{6}}}, you would change the problem to 2941×56{\displaystyle {\frac {294}{1}}\times {\frac {5}{6}}}.


, This will give you your new numerator.

For example, 294×5=1,470{\displaystyle 294\times 5=1,470}.


, This will give you your new denominator. Rewrite the new fraction.

For example, 1×6=6{\displaystyle 1\times 6=6}. So the new fraction is 1,4706{\displaystyle {\frac {1,470}{6}}}.


, First divide the numerator by the denominator to see if the result is a whole number. If the result is not a whole number, you should reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor. For complete instructions on how to reduce a fraction, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, 1,470÷6=245{\displaystyle 1,470\div 6=245}, so 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294=245{\displaystyle 294=245}. This is the fractional amount you are decreasing by.


, This will give you your final answer.

For example, 294−245=49{\displaystyle 294-245=49}. So, if you have $294{\displaystyle \$294}, and you give 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of it away, you have $49{\displaystyle \$49} left.

Know that a fraction is a way of indicating parts of a whole.,
Keep in mind that you can write fractions on the same line using a slash; the left number is the numerator and the right number is the denominator.",How to Work out Fractions1," The top number, called the numerator, represents the number of parts you're working with. The bottom number, called the denominator, represents how many parts there are in total.;
, If you are working with fractions that are on the same line, it's helpful to rewrite them so the numerator is on top of the denominator.


For example, if you have 1 piece of a pizza that was cut into 4 pieces, you have 1/4 of a pizza. If you have 7/3 pizzas, you have two whole pizzas plus 1 piece of a pizza that was cut into three pieces.

Cross multiply the two fractions.",How to Understand Fractions," A fraction is always written with one number on top of a line and another number underneath that line. The numerator of a fraction is the top number. It is the “part” of the “whole” that you are talking about.For example, in the fraction ¼, 1 is the numerator. The fraction indicates one part of a whole that has four parts.;
, The denominator is the bottom number of the fraction and represents the “whole”. It is the number of parts the whole is divided into. To remember the denominator think “down”-ominator.For example, in the fraction ¼, 4 is the denominator. This whole has been divided into four equal parts.

, A fraction is considered improper if the numerator (the top number) is larger than the denominator (the bottom number). When working with fractions, you never want to write a final solution as an improper fraction. Always remember to simplify it into a mixed or whole number.Some examples of improper fractions: 10/3, 9/4, 15/3, 25/5.

, Some fractions can simply be divided into a whole number, while others will not divide evenly. Numbers that don’t divide evenly must be rewritten as a mixed number.To simplify an improper fraction, first divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, for the fraction 10/3, divide 10 by 3.
3 goes into 10 three times (3 x 3 = 9), but there will be a remainder of 1.
Write the remainder as a fraction of the original denominator. With a remainder of 1 the fraction of the mixed number will be 1/3.
The mixed number of 10/3 is 31/3.
Note, not all improper fractions will be mixed numbers; some will simplify into whole numbers. For example: 25/5 simplifies to 5.

, You might be surprised to find that you use fractions on a pretty regular basis throughout your day. Do you ever trade or share food with your friends at lunch? Maybe you trade half of your chips for half a dessert. These are fractions!


Do you ever help your parents with baking? Measuring cups use fractions. A recipe may call for ¼ teaspoon of vanilla or 2/3 of a cup of flour.
Pay attention throughout your day and see how many times you use fractions without even realizing it.

, A good way to visualize fractions is to draw a picture to represent the fraction you are working with. You can start with any shape you would like, but here we will use a circle. Draw a large circle that you will be able to divide into multiple equal parts.The circle itself is not a fraction. It represents the whole number one.

, Draw a straight line down the middle of the circle dividing it into two equal pieces. You now have a circle that has two parts that make it a whole. When you are dividing shapes to represent fractions, remember to always divide the shape up evenly so you have equal parts.If you shade one part of the circle, you will have shaded ½ of the circle. The other half remains untouched.

, Now, draw another straight line horizontally across the center of the circle. The circle should now be divided into four equal parts. You can represent this whole circle as 4/4.If you shade one piece of the circle, you would have ¼ of the circle shaded.
If you shade two pieces of the circle, you would have 2/4 of the circle shaded. Note that 2/4 simplifies to ½. You can also see this visually because you have shaded half of the circle even though it is divided into 4 parts.

, You can continue to divide the circle into as many equal parts as you would like. Adding two more lines through the quarters will give you a circle divided into eight equal parts.Continue shading parts and writing the fraction that represents the shaded area. Remember, for a circle divided into eight parts, the denominator will always be 8; only the numerator will change to represent the shaded regions.

, An equivalent fraction is a set of fractions that may look different from each other, but in reality are the same when reduced to their simplest forms.The easiest way to recognize equivalent fractions is to simplify each fraction and compare them.


An example of three equivalent fractions: 1/2, 5/10, 10/20


, When you are first starting out with fractions, an easy way to understand them is to draw a picture. Remember, the “whole” of the fraction is represented by the denominator and is the bottom number of the fraction.Compare the diagrams of each fraction and see if they match. A diagram of 1/2, 5/10, and 10/20 will have identical shaded regions and therefore are all equivalent fractions.
Note: For numbers with large denominators, it will be a bit more difficult to draw pictures.

, Another way to check for equivalent fractions is to reduce each fraction to its simplest form. You will frequently come across fractions that haven’t been simplified and they may look different in this form. Reduce both of the fractions and then compare them.


For example: 1/2 is in its simplest form, but 5/10 and 10/20 can be simplified further.

5/10 can be divided by 5 to simplify to 1/2.

10/20 can be divided by 10 to simplify to 1/2.

, To cross multiply means to set the two fractions equal to each other and multiply across the equals sign in a “cross” or “x” shape. The denominator of one fraction is multiplied by the numerator of the other fraction. Then the other denominator and numerator are multiplied together.If the two products are equal to each other, the fractions are equivalent fractions.


For example: set 10/20 = 1/2.
Cross multiply: 2 x 10 = 20 x 1.
20 = 20; therefore, the fractions are equivalent.
Another example: 5/10 = 1/2.
Cross multiply: 5 x 2 = 10 x 1.
10 = 10; therefore, the fractions are equivalent.

Understand that a compound fraction has a whole number and a fraction, such as 2 1/3 or 45 1/2.,
Convert compound fractions by multiplying the whole number by the denominator of the fraction and then adding the numerator.,
Change a simple fraction to a compound fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator.",How to Work out Fractions2," Usually, you must convert a compound fraction to a simple fraction before you can add, subtract, multiply or divide it.

, Write a new fraction with the total as the numerator and the same number as the denominator.


For example, 2 1/3 becomes 7/3: 2 times 3, plus 1.

, Write down the whole number you get by dividing and make the remainder the numerator of the fraction. The denominator is the same.


For example, for the fraction 7/3, divide 7 by 3 to get 2 with the remainder of one; the compound fraction is 2 1/3. You can only do this if the numerator is larger than the denominator.

"
"
Find the common denominator of the fractions you are adding or subtracting.,
Add the numerators together and keep the same denominator.,
Use the same technique to subtract fractions as you did to add fractions by finding the common denominator first, but instead of adding, subtract the numerator of the second fraction from the numerator of the first.,
Reduce the fraction if you can by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.,
Convert the fraction to a compound fraction if the numerator is larger than the denominator.

",How to Work out Fractions3," To do this, you can multiply the denominators together, then multiply each numerator by the number you used to find its denominator. Sometimes you can find a common denominator that is a smaller number than you would get if you simply multiplied denominators together.


For example, to add the fractions 1/2 and 1/3, you first make the denominators the same by multiplying them together to get 6. Multiply 1 by 3 to get 3 as the new numerator for the first fraction. Multiply 1 by 2 to get 2 as the new numerator for the second fraction. Your new fractions are 3/6 and 2/6.
If you study the fractions, you'll see that 3 is half of 6, which is the same as saying 1/2, and 2 is one-third of 6, which is the same as saying 1/3. The fractions 1/3 and 1/6 would have a common denominator of 6, because 3 goes into 6 2 times. Therefore, 1/3 becomes 2/6.

,


For example, 3/6 and 2/6 becomes 5/6; 2/6 and 1/6 becomes 3/6.

,


For example, to subtract 1/3 from 1/2, first rewrite the fractions as 3/6 and 2/6, then subtract 2 from 3 to get 1. The result is 1/6.

,


For example, a fraction such as 5/6 can't be reduced, but 3/6 can be reduced to 1/2 by dividing both halves by 3.

"
Multiply the numerators and denominators separately to get the result.,
To divide fractions, turn the second fraction upside down, the multiply them together.",How to Work out Fractions4,"


For example, when you multiply 1/2 and 1/3, you will get 1/6 (1 times 1 over 2 times 3). It's not necessary to find a common denominator when multiplying. Reduce or convert the result if you can.

,


For example, if you want to divide 1/2 by 1/3, first rewrite the equation so the second fraction is 3/1. Multiply 1/2 by 3/1. The result will be 3/2. Reduce the fraction or convert it to a compound fraction if you can.

"
Work out all fractions in the same way, no matter how complicated they look.

,
To add and subtract more than two fractions, you can find a common denominator for all of them or you can work with them in pairs from left to right.",How to Work out Fractions5,",


For example, to add 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4, you can change them 6/12, 4/12, and 3/12 to get 13/12 or you can add 3/6 and 2/6 to get 5/6, then add 5/6 to 1/4 (10/12 plus 3/12) to get 13/12. Convert this to 1 1/12.

For example, you may need to find the harmonic mean for the numbers 10, 12, 16, and 8.


, This will equal the number of values in your set.

For example, if you are finding the harmonic mean of the numbers 10, 12, 16, and 8, you are working with 4 values, the numerator of your formula will be 4:41a1+1a2+1a3+...+1an{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{{\frac {1}{a_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{a_{2}}}+{\frac {1}{a_{3}}}+...+{\frac {1}{a_{n}}}}}}


, You will take the reciprocal of each number and add them in the denominator of the formula.Remember, when you take the reciprocal of a whole number, you turn the number into a fraction by placing a 1 in the numerator and the whole number in the denominator.

For example, if the values in your set are 10, 12, 16, and 8, you would place the fractions 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}}, 112{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{12}}}, 116{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{16}}}, 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} in your denominator:4110+112+116+18{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{{\frac {1}{10}}+{\frac {1}{12}}+{\frac {1}{16}}+{\frac {1}{8}}}}}

;
, One way to reduce a fraction is to divide by a greatest common factor.If the numerator is a multiple of the denominator, that means each can be divided by a greatest common factor (the numerator). These types of fractions can be reduced to a unit fraction.

For example, 26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}} is not simplified, because 6 is a multiple of 2. The numerator and denominator can still be divided by a common factor of 2, simplifying the fraction to 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}}.

The fraction 25{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{5}}} is simplified, because 5 is not a multiple of 2.


, A prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and 1.If the denominator is prime, the fraction cannot be simplified any further.This is because the denominator can only be divided by itself, so whatever number appears in the numerator will not have a common factor. For more information about prime numbers, you can read Check if a Number Is Prime.

For example, 1523{\displaystyle {\frac {15}{23}}} is simplified, because 23 is a prime number. The only factors of 23 are 23 and 1, so it is impossible to find a greatest common factor you can use to simplify the numerator and denominator. (If the numerator were 1, it would be a unit fraction and thus already simplified. If the numerator were 23, the fraction would equal 1.)


, If the difference is 1, then the fraction is simplified.

For example, you know that 78{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{8}}} is simplified, because 7−8=1{\displaystyle 7-8=1} 


, A fraction can be simplified by looking for the largest number that can be evenly divided into the numerator and denominator, and then dividing each by that number.

For example, if you are reducing 515{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{15}}}, divide the numerator and denominator by 5. This will give you 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}}, which you know cannot be reduced further because it is a unit fraction.


, Do not make any calculations: 15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5}}}, 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}}, 510{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10}}}.

The fractions 15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5}}} and 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}} are in their reduced, or simplified, form, because each is a unit fraction, with 1 as the numerator. You should know that 510{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10}}} is not simplified, because 10 is a multiple of 5.


, Franny says that 12109{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{109}}} is a simplified fraction. Without making any calculations, how do you know she is correct?

Since 109 is a prime number, you can tell that the fraction is simplified. 109 is only divisible by 109 and 1, so it shares no common factors with 12.


, Do not make any calculations: 45{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}}, 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}}, 48{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{8}}}

Since 5−4=1{\displaystyle 5-4=1}, you know that 45{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}} is simplified. Since 7 is a prime number, you know that 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}} is simplified. Since 8 is a multiple of 4, you know that 48{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{8}}} is NOT simplified.

For example:4110+112+116+18=489240{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{{\frac {1}{10}}+{\frac {1}{12}}+{\frac {1}{16}}+{\frac {1}{8}}}}={\frac {4}{\frac {89}{240}}}}


, Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.For example:489240{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{\frac {89}{240}}}}=4×24089{\displaystyle =4\times {\frac {240}{89}}}=41×24089{\displaystyle ={\frac {4}{1}}\times {\frac {240}{89}}}=96089{\displaystyle ={\frac {960}{89}}}


, To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator.For example:96089{\displaystyle {\frac {960}{89}}}=960÷89{\displaystyle =960\div 89}=10.79{\displaystyle =10.79}So, the harmonic mean of the numbers 10, 12, 16, and 8 is 10.79.

Make the numerators of the fractions match their new denominators.,
Write the new numerators over the lowest common denominator.,
Subtract the numerators.,
Simplify your answer.",How to Subtract Fractions," If you want to subtract fractions, then the first thing you have to do is to make sure that they have like denominators. The numerator is the number on the top of the fraction and the denominator is the number on the bottom. In the example, 3/4 - 1/3, the two denominators of the fractions are 4 and 3. Circle them.

If the denominators of the fractions are the same, then you can just subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same. For example, 4/5 - 3/5 = 1/5. If the fraction is in simplified form, as this one is, then you're done.;
, The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers. You'll need to find the LCM of 4 and 3, which will give you the lowest common denominator (LCD) of the fraction. Here's the best method to use for small numbers:


List the first few multiples of 4: 4 x 1 = 4, 4 x 2 = 8, 4 x 3 = 12, 4 x 4 =16
List the first few multiples of 3: 3 x 1 =3, 3 x 2 = 6, 3 x 3 = 9, 3 x 4 = 12
Stop when you have found a common multiple. You can see that 12 is a multiple of both 4 and 3. Since it's the smallest, you can stop there.

Note that you can do this for all numbers, including whole numbers and mixed numbers. For whole numbers, think of the denominator as 1. (Thus, 2 = 2/1.) For mixed numbers, rewrite the mixed number as an improper fraction. (Thus, 2 1/2 = 5/2.)



, Now that you know that the LCM of 4 and 3 is 12, you can think of 12 as the new denominator of the fractions. But to make the fractions equivalent, you'll have to multiply their numerators by a number that would give them the same value with their new denominators. Here's how you do it:

With the fraction 3/4, you know the new denominator is 12, so you'll have to find the number that 4 multiplies with to get 12. 4 x 3 = 12, so you'll essentially be multiplying 3/4 x 3/3 for the numerator and denominator to retain the original value of the fraction. You know that 4 x 3 is 12, and that's the denominator, and 3 x 3 is 9, so the new numerator of the fraction is 9. 3/4 can be rewritten as 9/12.
With the fraction 1/3, you know the new denominator is 12, so you'll have to find the number that 3 multiplies with to get 12. 3 x 4 = 12, so you'll essentially be multiplying 1/3 x 4/4 for the numerator and denominator to retain the original value of the fraction. You know that 3 x 4 is 12, and that's the denominator, and 1 x 4 is 4, so the new numerator of the fraction is 4. 1/3 can be rewritten as 4/12.

, Now that you know that the lowest common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12, you can say that the lowest common denominator of the fractions 1/3 and 3/4 is 12. Now that you know the new numerators, you can just write them over the same denominator as one fraction with subtracted numerators. Make sure to write the new numerators in the appropriate order, since changing the order in a subtraction problem will give you the wrong answer. Here's what you can write:

3/4 - 1/3 = 9/12 - 4/12
9/12 - 4/12 = (9-4)/12

, Once you have written the new numerators over the LCD, you are ready to subtract. Simply subtract the numerators in the appropriate order; do not do anything to the denominator.

9-4 = 5, so 9/12 - 4/12 = 5/12

, Once you have your answer, check to see if you can simplify it. If the numerator and denominator can be divided by the same number, divide them by that number. Remember that fractions are proportions, so whatever you do to the numerator, you must also do to the denominator. Do not divide one without dividing the other by the same number. 5/12 remains as it is because it cannot be simplified further.


For example, the fraction 6/8 can be simplified because both 6 and 8 are divisible by 2. Just divide 6 and 8 by 2 for a new simplified answer: 6/2 = 3, 8/2 = 4, so 6/8 = 3/4.

Use the standard deviation to calculate the standard error, using the basic formula.",How to Calculate Standard Error," The standard deviation of a sample is a measure of how spread out the numbers are. A sample standard deviation is generally signified with an s. The mathematical formula for standard deviation is shown above.;
, The population mean is the mean of a numerical set that includes all the numbers within the entire group – in other words, the average of an entire set of numbers, rather than a sample.

, The arithmetic mean is simply an average: the sum of a collection of values divided by the number of values in the collection.

, When an arithmetic mean is based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, it is called the “sample mean.” It is the average of a numerical set that includes an average of only a portion of the numbers within a group. It is denoted as:

, Normal distributions, which are the most commonly used of all distributions, are symmetrical, with a single central peak at the mean (or average) of the data. The shape of the curve is similar to the shape of a bell, with the graph falling off evenly on either side of the mean. Fifty percent of the distribution lies to the left of the mean, and fifty percent lies to the right. The spread of a normal distribution is controlled by the standard deviation.

, The formula for standard error of a sample mean is shown above.

, To find the standard error, first you must determine the standard deviation (because the standard deviation, s, is part of the standard error formula). Start by finding the average of your sample values. Sample mean is expressed as the arithmetic mean of measurements x1, x2, . . . xn. It is calculated with a formula that is shown above.


For example, say you need to calculate the standard error of a sample mean for the weight measurements of five coins, as listed in the table below:
You would calculate the sample mean by plugging the weight values into the formula, like this:

, Once you have the sample mean, you can expand your table by subtracting it from each individual measurement, then squaring the result.


In the example above, your expanded table would look like this:

, The total deviation is the average of these squared differences from the sample mean. Add your new values together to determine it.


In the example above, you would calculate as follows:
This equation gives you the total quadratic deviation of measurements from the sample mean. Note that the sign of the differences is not important.

, Once you know the total deviation, you can find the average deviation by dividing by n -1. Note that n is equal to the number of measurements.


In the example above, you have five measurements, so n – 1 would equal 4. You would calculate as follows:

, You now have all the necessary values to use the formula for standard deviation, s.


In the example above, you would calculate standard deviation as follows:
Your standard deviation is therefore 0.0071624.

,


In the example above, you would calculate standard error as follows:
Your standard error (the standard deviation of your sample mean) is therefore 0.0032031 grams.

Change the mixed numbers into improper fractions.,
Find the least common denominator (LCD).The least common denominator is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both denominators.,
Divide the LCD by the denominators of the fractions.,
Make the fractions have the same base.,
Subtract.,
Convert the improper fraction into a mixed number.",How to Subtract Mixed Numbers," You can covert a mixed number into an improper fraction in just three easy steps:


First, multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction.

If you are converting the number 3 3/4 to an improper fraction, you would first multiply the whole number 3 by the denominator of the fraction, 4. 3 * 4 = 12.


Add this number to the numerator of the fraction.

Add your previous answer 12 to the numerator, 3. 3 + 12 = 15.


Place this new number over the original denominator of the fraction.

The new number is 15, so you can place it over 4, the original denominator. The mixed number 3 3/4 converts to the improper fraction 15/4.


To convert the second number, 1 1/2, to an improper fraction, you should first multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction.

Multiply 1 by 2 to get 2.
Then, add 2 to the numerator of the fraction. 2 + 1 = 3.
Put the new number, 3, over the original denominator, 2, to get 3/2.

;
,


The denominators are 4 and 2, and the LCD is 4 because 4 is evenly divisible by both 4 and 2.
The LCD is often a number that is greater than both numbers. For example, the LCD of 3 and 6 is 12, because that is the lowest number that is divisible by both 3 and 6. The LCD can never be smaller than either number.

, 4/4 = 1, so 15/4 becomes 15/1. 4/2 = 2 so 3/2 remains 3/2.

, Before you can subtract the fractions, they need to have the same base. To give them the same base, 4, you need to multiply the numerator of each fraction by the numbers you got from dividing their numerators into the LCD in the previous step. This will keep the numerators of the fractions proportional with their new denominator, 4.


15/1 : since your answer was 1 when you divided the LCD by the denominator (4/4 = 1), you should multiply the numerator by 1. Since 15 * 1 = 1, the fraction 15/1 will be converted into 15/4.
3/2 : since your answer was 2 when you divided the LCD by the denominator (4/2 = 2), you should multiply the numerator by 2. 3 * 2 = 6, so the fraction 3/2 will be changed into 6/4.

, Now that you've converted the numbers to have the same denominator, you can subtract them. To subtract numbers with the same denominator, you only need to subtract the numerators.

15/4 - 6/4 = 9/4.

, Since the question is in mixed number form, the final answer should be a mixed number. You have to work backwards to convert the improper fraction back into a mixed number. Here's how you do it:


First, divide the top number by the bottom number. Do long division to divide 4 into 9. 4 goes into 9 2 times. This means that the quotient is 2. The remainder, or the number that is left over, is 1.
Make your quotient the new whole number. Take your remainder and place it over the original denominator to finish converting the improper fraction into a mixed number. The quotient is 2, the remainder is 1, and the original denominator was 4, so the final answer is 2 1/4.

"
"
Start with an improper fraction.,
Rewrite it as a division problem.,
Begin solving the division problem.,
Find the remainder.,
Write the mixed number using your results.",How to Turn an Improper Fraction Into a Mixed Number1," We'll use 15/4 for our example. This is an improper fraction because the numerator, 15, is greater than the denominator, 4.


If you're not comfortable with fractions or division yet, start with the example below instead.;
, Write the fraction as a long division problem.Always write the numerator divided by the denominator. In our example, this is 15 ÷ 4.

, Review long division first if you're not sure what to do. This example will be easier to follow if you write out the long division problem as you read it:


Compare 4 to the first digit, 1. 4 doesn't go into 1, so we need to include the next digit.
Compare 4 to the first two digits, 15. How many times does 4 go into 15? If you're not sure, guess and see if you're right using multiplication.
The answer is 3, so write 3 on the answer line, above the 5.

, Unless the numbers divide perfectly, there will be a remainder left over. Here's how to find the remainder in a long division problem:Multiply the answer by the divisor (the number on the left). In our example, that's 3 x 4.
Write the result underneath the dividend (the number underneath the division bracket). In our example, 3 x 4 = 12, so write 12 underneath the 15.
Subtract the result from the dividend: 15 - 12 = 3. This is the remainder

, A mixed number is a whole number, plus a proper fraction. After solving your division problem, you have everything you need to write this mixed number:


The whole number is your answer to the division problem. In this case, that's 3.
The numerator of the fraction is your remainder. In this case, that's also 3.
The denominator of the fraction is the same as the denominator in the original fraction. In this case, that's 4.
Write this as one mixed number: 33/4.

"
"
Write down the fraction.,
Remember which fractions equal one.,
Split the fraction into two parts.,
Find the second part.,
Simplify the fraction.,
Repeat these instructions if the fraction is still improper.",How to Turn an Improper Fraction Into a Mixed Number2," An improper fraction is any fraction with a top number larger than the bottom number. For example, 3/2 is an improper fraction, because 3 is larger than 2.


The top number of a fraction is called the numerator. The bottom number is called the denominator.

This method will take a long time for large fractions. If the numerator is much larger than the bottom number, the division method above is much faster.

, Did you know that 2 ÷ 2 = 1? Or that 4 ÷ 4 = 1? In fact, any number divided by itself equals one. Fractions are exactly the same. 2/2 = 1, and 4/4 = 1, and even 397/397 equals 1!

, That sounded like an easy way to turn a fraction into a whole number. Let's see if we can do that for part of our improper fraction:


For 3/2, the denominator (lower number) is 2.

2/2 is an easy fraction to simplify, because the top and bottom numbers are the same. We want to take this out of the larger fraction, and find out what we have left behind.
Write this down: 3/2 = 2/2 + ?/2.

, How do we turn that question mark into a number? If you don't know how to add and subtract fractions, don't worry. When the denominators (bottom numbers) are the same, we can ignore them and turn the problem into ordinary addition. Here's a step by step guide for our example, 3/2 = 2/2 + ?/2:


Look at just the numerators (top numbers). They say 3 = 2 + ""?"". what number can we write instead of that question mark to solve the problem? What number can you add to 2 to get 3?
The answer is 1, because 3 = 2 + 1.
When you get the answer, write the equation again, including the denominators: 3/2 = 2/2 + 1/2.

, Now we know our improper fraction is the same as 2/2 + 1/2. We also know that 2/2 = 1, just like any fraction with the same top and bottom number. That means you can cross out 2/2, and write 1 instead. Now we have 1 + 1/2, which is a mixed number! For this example, the problem is solved.


Once you've found the solution, you don't need to write the + symbol anymore. Just write 11/2.
A mixed number is a whole number plus a proper fraction., Sometimes, the fraction part of your answer will still be improper, with a numerator larger than the denominator. In this case, you can start again with that fraction, turning it into another mixed number. Don't forget to add the ""1"" back when you're done. Here's an example, turning 7/3 into a mixed fraction:



7/3 = 3/3 + ?/3

7 = 3 + ?
7 = 3 + 4

7/3 = 3/3 + 4/3


7/3 = 1 + 4/3

That fraction is improper, so ignore the 1 for now and do the same thing: 4/3 = 3/3 + ?/3

4 = 3 + ?
4 = 3 + 1

4/3 = 3/3 + 1/3


4/3 = 1 + 1/3

That fraction is proper, so we're done. Remember to add the 1 we ignored earlier: 1 + 1 + 1/3 = 21/3.

There are four common symptoms that can help you recognize if this is the case for you: panic, paranoia, passive behavior and lack of confidence.Ask yourself some of the following questions to see if you might have math phobia:


Panic: Do you feel a wave of helplessness or terror associated with math class, tests, quizzes, and homework?
Paranoia: Are you concerned that you are the only person in the world who can’t do the math problems and that everyone else is smarter than you?
Passive behavior: Have you given up on trying to learn and understand math entirely because you feel that you are just not smart enough?
Lack of confidence: Do you second guess all of your answers and rely on others to help you through the material?;
, As with most phobias and addictions, the first step to treatment is admitting the problem. Having math phobia in itself does not make you a bad person, but not dealing with it will affect your life negatively.This is especially important if you have a child who is struggling with math. Your own anxiety can increase theirs.

, Everyone has different abilities and learns at a different pace. Make sure that you are placed in the proper level of mathematics before you begin. Being placed in a course that is more advanced than you are can be extremely frustrating as you struggle to keep up with the material.Talk to your advisors and discuss what level of math they think is appropriate for your skill level.
Take a math placement test to help you gauge your level of knowledge.

, At the high school level or below, this may not be an option, but at the college level you can choose your professor and math section. There are many online sites where previous students have rated a professor that will allow you to get an idea of their teaching style.Ask other students who have been in that professor’s class about how they liked it.
Schedule a meeting with the professor and ask them specifically about how they teach. Tell them about your learning style and discuss whether you think they’d be a good fit for you.

, Math concepts build upon each other and if you get lost in the beginning, it will be much harder to understand later concepts. Good teachers want their students to succeed; they won't necessarily know your underlying problem if you don't let them know.Try not to feel embarrassed about asking a question. If you don’t understand something, it’s likely that there is at least one other person in the room who is also confused.

, In most groups of problems assigned as homework, the easiest problems come first and progress in difficulty toward the end. Answer the easier problems first and then work your way through the more difficult ones.Take your time and skip over a problem when you get stuck. You can always go back to it later.


This strategy works well for quizzes and tests as well. Don’t forget to go back to the questions you skipped along the way!

, Instead of cramming for a test the night before, set aside time each day to study and do practice problems. This will decrease your anxiety about having enough time to learn everything you need to know.Repeated long-term practice will help you remember how to solve things when stressed in the testing environment.
Studying early also gives you time to focus on the concepts that are more difficult to master.

, Other than possibly varying the level of difficulty back and forth, the only difference between a test and homework is that you have a more limited amount of time to complete a test in. You can ease your anxiety about a math test if you approach it with a positive attitude and a plan of attack.Put the test's importance in its proper perspective. The test is only to measure how well you've learned the material in the unit it covers, not about your overall worth as a student or as a person.
Use your limited time wisely. Don't dawdle, but don't rush, either. Take enough time to read a question over to understand it. Knock out the easiest questions first, and use the remaining time to work through the more difficult questions.
Show your work; you're not just being tested on getting the right answer but on your understanding of the method used to get the right answer.

, Talk to your teacher and ask them about options for getting extended time for taking quizzes and exams. Having extra time to get through the test can help ease your anxiety about getting to every question in the allotted time.You may need to speak to a counselor or take a diagnostic test to qualify for extended time.

, While believing you can't do math has probably affected the way you study it, changing the way you study math may change your attitude about it. Simply memorizing a formula is not as effective as understanding what the formula means and knowing exactly when to use it. Try some of the methods listed below:Read the textbook as thoroughly as you can. You may need to read the lesson over several times if some of the passages are difficult or information-dense, but allow yourself time to absorb the text as best you can. Write down questions as you read to ask about in class later.
Learn to be discerning in taking lecture notes. Your goal is to understand the lecture, not to scribble notes for the sake of scribbling notes. Take the time to evaluate the lecture for what's important and write that down, then write down the supporting material.
Try studying in groups. Working with a study group can sometimes help you understand the subject better than doing everything alone. One of your classmates who ""gets it"" may be able to explain it to you in a way you can understand.

, If your child seems completely disinterested or even scared to do their math homework, they may have anxiety towards the subject. Your child may say something like “I’ll never be good at math” and assume that they just don’t have the intelligence for the subject.Pay attention to your child’s behavior and see if they get upset specifically when they have to do math or if there is some other reason for their behavior that day.

, Positive reinforcement is a great way to help your child overcome math phobia. Instead of being negative when they get something wrong, talk through the problems with them and emphasize the aspects that they got correct. Point out the skills that they have mastered and stay positive about the ones that still need some work.Hire a tutor so they can get one-on-one help in a positive, confidence-building learning environment.

, Talk about math in a positive way. If your child gets an answer wrong, have them look at the problem again, without berating them for the mistake. There are several ways you can foster a positive learning environment for studying mathematics, or any other subject, for that matter:Remind your child that math skills aren't learned automatically and that everyone learns at a different rate.
Let your child set up a study environment that suits them, within reason. While you may not want to allow visual distractions such as the TV or internet, your child may prefer background music, or to study on the floor supported by pillows instead of sitting at a desk.
Allow calculators and computers for doing the actual calculations, but encourage your child to learn to set up the problem without assistance.

, If your child is having trouble with math, working longer at it usually won't solve the problem. Extended study without a break can lead to frustration. Take a short break to let your child process the information and avoid prolonged frustration.Taking a step back to find out what the problem is and developing an alternate approach is a better way for your child to learn and understand.

, It is very easy to become overwhelmed when presented with a problem set or test with 30 questions in it. You never sit down and try to read a whole book all at once, so why would you try to do that with math? Encourage your child to focus on one question at time.If they come across a problem that is particularly difficult, tell them to skip it and come back to it later. Answering the easier questions will build their confidence for when they get to the harder ones.

, Mathematics plays a role in many aspects of life, such as cooking (ratios and proportions), sports (scorekeeping), home upkeep (calculating quantities of building materials and paint, budgeting), and others. Showing the practical uses of math may motivate your child to learn math instead of fear it.Try to turn math problems into games while doing daily household activities.

, To help a child struggling with math, you need to know how it's being taught in his or her classroom. It may be that your child needs more attention than is possible in the classroom, or your child may learn math better if taught it a different way.Discuss the matter with your child's teacher, who can help you plan a suitable way to supplement your child's education.
Your child may think about problems differently than you do. Encourage them to solve problems in the way that makes the most sense to them.

, In addition to the calculator and computer, there are a number of math teaching aids to assist in performing basic calculations, including finger calculation methods such as Chizanbop and devices such as Cuisenaire rods, Dienes blocks, and Napier's rods. You can learn about these and other methods from the website of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and other sources.


The NCTM website features a section devoted to helping parents and other family members help their children learn math, including an overview of how math is currently taught., Coupled with math anxiety is the belief that math is not a ""fun"" subject. In fact, math can be fun if approached the right way.


Games such as Battleship and mancala teach logical thinking skills, while games such as Yahtzee teach number recognition, probability, and strategy.There are also a number of educational games available through the NCTM website.Puzzles such as magic squares teach pattern recognition and logical thinking while reinforcing calculation skills, and also show some of the interesting relationships between numbers in our mathematical system.
Math humor helps students take themselves less seriously while taking math itself seriously. Math humor can come in the form of cartoons, jokes (such as the number 7 being cannibalistic because ""7 ate 9""), or even song parody (such as the original author of this article parodying the Five Man Electric Band's song ""Signs"" as ""Sines,"" about the difficulties of learning trigonometry).

, Your child may have a tendency to come home and complain that they just aren’t as good at math as one of their classmates. Try to discourage this type of talk and let them know that they just learn at a different pace. Math is not a competition.Avoid making statements around your child that may give them the impression that you are comparing them to their own classmates or siblings.

, Some people develop a fear of mathematics because they believe things about math that aren't necessary true. Statements like, “men are better at math than women” or “there is no creativity involved in math” are just a few myths that are commonly heard and believed.While there have historically been more male mathematicians than female mathematicians, no evidence exists to show that men are innately better at math than women. Historically, men have had better educational opportunities than women, but this is changing.
Some believe that math is all about logic, with little to do with creativity. Although logical thinking is necessary to work through the steps to solve a math problem, understanding where to begin in solving the problem sometimes requires a healthy dose of intuition.
Some believe that to be good in math means being able to do all the calculations in your head. Counting on the fingers shows an understanding of basic arithmetic, and a form of finger calculation led to the development of the abacus.
Some believe that being good in math means getting the right answer in the right way. While the ways taught to do certain calculations are the easiest and ""best"" methods, they're not the only methods. When adding 1/6 to 3/8, it's usually taught to convert to the equivalent fractions of 4/24 and 9/24 to add to make 13/24 because 24 is the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8. However, it's also okay to convert the fractions to 8/48 and 18/48 (6 x 8 = 48) and add to make 26/48, which reduces to 13/24. Finding the lowest common multiple simply means you have smaller numerators to add together.

, Related to the common myths about mathematical ability listed above are personal beliefs about one's inability to do math. People with math phobias may believe they can't get the answer fast enough, or that if they got the answer, the problem had to have been too easy. In truth, while a math test may be timed, mathematics is not about how fast you get the answer.


If the problem looked too simple, it’s more likely that you are actually better at math than you think you are.
When approaching math, take your time and take perfection out of it. Tell yourself that nobody is perfect and if you struggle with a problem, ask questions instead of giving up., Unfortunately, many teachers themselves suffer from math anxiety and accordingly do not teach math well. Such teachers usually fall back to teaching exclusively from the textbook, relying on memorizing facts, and employing only drill and practice to reinforce the lesson.


Note that while many college education programs require future teachers to declare and be educated in an academic specialization or concentration, school districts may hire teachers for teaching positions outside that area of specialization. Thus, a teacher hired to teach mathematics may not have had a great deal of academic coursework in the subject and how to teach it.

, If you yourself suffer from math anxiety, you'll more than likely pass your fears onto your children if you don't address them. Although telling your child that it's okay not to be good at math because you weren't on the surface sounds supportive, it also lowers their expectations for themselves.Cultivate a positive environment relating to mathematics, especially when helping your children with their assignments.

Multiply the numerators of the fractions.,
Multiply the denominators of the fractions.,
Simplify the fraction.",How to Divide and Multiply Fractions1," The numerator is the number on the top of a fraction and the denominator is the number on the bottom. The first step to multiplying fractions is to line them up so that their numerators and denominators are next to each other. If you're multiplying the fraction 1/2 by 12/48, then the first thing you want to do is multiply the numerators, 1 and 12. 1 x 12 = 12. Write the product, 12, in the numerator of the answer.;
, Now, you'll just have to do the same thing with the denominators. Multiply 2 and 48 to find the new denominator. 2 x 48 = 96. Write this answer in the denominator of the new fraction. Therefore, the new fraction is 12/96.

, The last step is to simplify the result if it can be done. To simplify a fraction, you have to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of both the numerator and the denominator. The GCF is the largest number that can be evenly divided into both numbers. In the case of 12 and 96, 12 happens to evenly divide into 96. So, divide 12 by 12 to get 1, and divide 96 by 12 to get 8. Therefore, 12/96 ÷ 12/12 = 1/8.


If both numbers are even, you can also start by dividing them both by 2 and keep going. 12/96 ÷ 2/2 = 6/48 ÷ 2/2 = 3/24. Then you may notice that 3 goes evenly into 24, so you can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3 to get 1/8. 3/24 ÷ 3/3 = 1/8.

Reverse the numerator and denominator of the second fraction and change the division sign to a multiplication sign.,
Multiply the numerators and denominators of the fractions and simplify your answer.",How to Divide and Multiply Fractions2," Let's say you're dividing the fraction 1/2 by 18/20. Now, find the reciprocal of 18/20 which is 20/18 and change the division sign to a multiplication sign. So, 1/2 ÷ 18/20 = 1/2 x 20/18.

, Now, do the same thing you would do to multiply. If you multiply the numerators, 1 and 20, you get the result of 20 in the numerator. If you multiply the denominators, 2 and 18, you get 36 in the numerator. The product of the fractions is 20/36. 4 is the largest number that is evenly divisible by both the numerator and the denominator of this fraction, so divide each by 4 to get the simplified answer. 20/36 ÷ 4/4 = 5/9.

Determine that you need to find the mean.,
Determine the series of numbers you need to calculate the mean for.,
Add together all the numbers in the series.,
Divide the sum of the numbers by how many numbers are in the series.","How to Calculate Averages (Mean, Median, Mode)1"," The mean is just one measure of central tendency, and is what most people think of when they think of the term average. It is best to use the mean when you need to find the average of a data set that does not have an outlier. An outlier is a number that is outside the normal range of distribution. For example, in the series 1, 289, 333, 303, the clear outlier is 1.

If the series has an outlier, it is better to calculate the median to find the central tendency.
;
, This is usually a set of three or more numbers. Make sure to include all the numbers in the series, including 0 and negative numbers.

For example, you might need to find the average low temperature in Chicago in the first week of January. The temperatures might be -1, 15, 0, 12, 15, 8, and 17 degrees.


, It might be helpful to use a calculator or spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel if you are working with a large data set. To learn more about using Excel to find the average, read Calculate Averages in Excel.

For example, if your series is -1, 15, 0, 12, 15, 8, 17, you would calculate:−1+15+0+12+15+8+17=66{\displaystyle -1+15+0+12+15+8+17=66}


, Don’t forget to count any data points that have a value of 0. This will give you the average of your series of numbers.

For example, there are 7 numbers in the series -1, 15, 0, 12, 15, 8, 17. So, you should divide their sum (66) by 7:66÷7=9.43{\displaystyle 66\div 7=9.43}So, the mean, or average, of the series is 9.43.

"
Determine that you need to find the median.,
Arrange the numbers in your series from least to greatest.,
Determine the middle number of the series.","How to Calculate Averages (Mean, Median, Mode)2"," The median is just one measure of central tendency. It is the middle value of a series of numbers.You can use the median for any series of numbers, but It is especially helpful to use it when you need to find the middle of a data set that has an outlier. An outlier is a number that is outside the normal range of distribution. 

For example, you might need to find the average rating customers gives a server at a restaurant. The ratings might be -1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 3, and 10. The 10 rating is an outlier (perhaps given by the server’s mom), because all of the other ratings are much lower on the scale. In this case, using the median, rather than the average, would give you a better feel for the middle of the data set. 


, Make sure to arrange all the numbers in the series, including 0 and any outliers.

If you are working with negative numbers, remember that they are less than 0 and should appear before positive numbers. 

For numbers that appear in the series more than once, make sure that when you reorder, you include each instance of that number.

If you are working with a large data set, it might be helpful to use a spreadsheet program, like Microsoft Excel, to sort your values. Read Sort a List in Microsoft Excel for more information on how to do this. 

For example, if your series is...−1,2,3,1,0,3,10{\displaystyle -1,2,3,1,0,3,10}...you would rearrange them in the following order:−1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}.


, To do this, find the number in the middle of the group that has the same amount of numbers before and after it. This middle number is your median.

For example, if your series is −1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}, the median is 2{\displaystyle 2}, because in the series three numbers are less than 2, and three numbers are greater than 2. 

If you have an even number of values in the series, you will need to take the mean of the middle two numbers. For example, if the series is 0,1,2,3{\displaystyle 0,1,2,3}, the median would be the mean of the two middle numbers (1, 2):1+2=3{\displaystyle 1+2=3}3÷2=1.5{\displaystyle 3\div 2=1.5} So the median in this instance would be 1.5.

"
Determine that you need to find the mode.,
Arrange the numbers in your series from least to greatest.,
Find the number that appears most often in the series.","How to Calculate Averages (Mean, Median, Mode)3"," The mode is just one measure of central tendency. It tells you which value appears in the data set most frequently. The mode is helpful because you can use it with non-numerical data. If no value repeats in the data set, then the data has no mode.

If multiple values appear in the set with the same frequency, then it is possible to have more than one mode.


, Make sure to arrange all the numbers in the series, including 0.

For numbers that appear in the series more than once, make sure that when you reorder, you include each instance of that number. 

If you are working with a large data set, it might be helpful to use a spreadsheet program, like Microsoft Excel, to sort your values. Read Sort a List in Microsoft Excel for more information on how to do this. 

For example, if your series is...−1,2,3,1,0,3,10{\displaystyle -1,2,3,1,0,3,10}...you would rearrange them in the following order:−1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}.


, This number will be your mode. Remember, it is possible to have more than one mode, or no modes at all.

For example, in the series −1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}, 3 is the only number that appears more than once, so 3 is the mode.

Look at your data set.,
Gather all of your data.,
Add the numbers in your sample together.,
Divide the sum by how many numbers there are in your sample (n).,
Find the variance.,
Subtract the mean from each of your numbers in your sample.,
Square all of the numbers from each of the subtractions you just did.,
Add the squared numbers together.,
Divide the sum of squares by (n-1).,
Find your variance figure.,
Take the square root of the variance.,
Go through finding the mean, variance and standard deviation again.",How to Calculate Standard Deviation," This is an important step in any type of statistical calculation, even if it is a simple figure like the mean or median.Know how many numbers are in your sample.
Do the numbers vary across a large range? Or are the differences between the numbers small, such as just a few decimal places?
Know what type of data you are looking at. What do your numbers in your sample represent? this could be something like test scores, heart rate readings, height, weight etc.
For example, a set of test scores is 10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4.;
, You will need every number in your sample to calculate the mean.The mean is the average of all your data points.
This is calculated by adding all of the numbers in your sample, then dividing this figure by the how many numbers there are in your sample (n).
In the sample of test scores (10, 8, 10, 8, 8, 4) there are 6 numbers in the sample. Therefore n = 6.

, This is the first part of calculating a mathematical average or mean.For example, use the data set of quiz scores: 10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4.
10 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 48. This is the sum of all the numbers in the data set or sample.
Add the numbers a second time to check your answer.

, This will provide the average or mean of the data.In the sample of test scores (10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4) there are six numbers, so n = 6.
The sum of the test scores in the example was 48. So you would divide 48 by n to figure out the mean.
48 / 6 = 8
The mean test score in the sample is 8.

, The variance is a figure that represents how far the data in your sample is clustered around the mean.This figure will give you an idea of how far your data is spread out.
Samples with low variance have data that is clustered closely about the mean.
Samples with high variance have data that is clustered far from the mean.
Variance is often used to compare the distribution of two data sets.

, This will give you a figure of how much each data point differs from the mean.For example, in our sample of test scores (10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4) the mean or mathematical average was 8.
10 - 8 = 2; 8 - 8 = 0, 10 - 8 = 2, 8 - 8 = 0, 8 - 8 = 0, and 4 - 8 = -4.
Do this procedure again to check each answer. It is very important you have each of these figures correct as you will need them for the next step.

, You will need each of these figures to find out the variance in your sample.Remember, in our sample we subtracted the mean (8) from each of the numbers in the sample (10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4) and came up with the following: 2, 0, 2, 0, 0 and -4.
To do the next calculation in figuring out variance you would perform the following: 22, 02, 22, 02, 02, and (-4)2 = 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, and 16.
Check your answers before proceeding to the next step.

, This figure is called the sum of squares.In our example of test scores, the squares were as follows: 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, and 16.
Remember, in the example of test scores we started by subtracting the mean from each of the scores and squaring these figures: (10-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (10-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (4-8)^2
4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 16 = 24.
The sum of squares is 24.

, Remember, n is how many numbers are in your sample. Doing this step will provide the variance. The reason to use n-1 is to have sample variance and population variance unbiased. In our sample of test scores (10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4) there are 6 numbers. Therefore, n = 6.
n-1 = 5.
Remember the sum of squares for this sample was 24.
24 / 5 = 4.8
The variance in this sample is thus 4.8.

, You will need this to find the standard deviation for your sample.Remember, variance is how spread out your data is from the mean or mathematical average.
Standard deviation is a similar figure, which represents how spread out your data is in your sample.
In our example sample of test scores, the variance was 4.8.

, This figure is the standard deviation.Usually, at least 68% of all the samples will fall inside one standard deviation from the mean.
Remember in our sample of test scores, the variance was 4.8.
√4.8 = 2.19. The standard deviation in our sample of test scores is therefore 2.19.
5 out of 6 (83%) of our sample of test scores (10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4) is within one standard deviation (2.19) from the mean (8).

, This will allow you to check your answer.It is important that you write down all steps to your problem when you are doing calculations by hand or with a calculator.
If you come up with a different figure the second time around, check your work.
If you cannot find where you made a mistake, start over a third time to compare your work.

Math is fun through Math games and activities.,
Take it easy and learn it easy.",How to Be an Expert in Math," Vacation is a time to enjoy, really. But if you plan on improving your math, some changes are necessary.


Along with enjoyment, find some time (at least 2 hours) to review your previous lessons.
If you have any doubts, clear it immediately with the help of your elders or friends (you may also take the help of the Internet).
If you're done with your review, take a break for 1-2 days (don't be too happy, there is more to it).
By the end of the vacation you would have improved (at least a little) and will be ready for school.;
, - This is the most important part that you should take care of while dealing with math.


Be careful and don't let your mind wander in class. During class hours, clear your mind and only concentrate on the topic.
Don't get distracted in any manner (or else you'll lose your concentration). If your friends are too distracting find another good spot which is comparatively silent.
Tell your friends to talk some other time if they invite to talk with you.

, In class, have a special notebook for Math. Note down all the important Mathematical ideas which have been discussed in class (and understand them). It would be great to write down every word your teacher said, but that is virtually impossible. Take special care to ensure that your notes are legible and understandable, but try to write quickly, leaving out short, meaningless words.


If your teacher is nice enough to point out what specifically will be on the test, use that to your advantage. Write it down, and leave a symbol (like a star, exclamation mark, etc.) near it if necessary.

, Doubts should be cleared immediately if you have any. But try not to disturb the class or the teacher while clarifying your doubts.

, In Math, especially in algebra, the lessons build on top of one another, so that if you sleep through September, you might be in real trouble when October comes. Try to be disciplined about doing your Math homework, and pay attention in class. If you make a habit of these things, the class will seem generally easier.

, Find someone in the class who cares as much about doing well in the class as you do. Make a habit of getting together to do your homework, or talking about the homework on the phone. Math can seem less scary when you don't have to do it alone. In fact, when you and a friend are working together to solve problems, it can be kind of fun.

, Find a certain time everyday when you can study. It might only be 30 minutes, but if you can say ""I'll study every day at 4:30,"" it'll make a huge difference. People don't like to change, but if you can make it a habit of studying at your time in your special study place, it will be easier to sit down and work.

, This can be a paid tutor, or any of your friends. Don't wait until you are getting failing in grades to find a tutor, but find one at the first sign of trouble. Don't be afraid to take advantage of any available help.

, Many people suffer from ""Math anxiety,"" where just thinking about math, gets them feeling less confident and more nervous. This makes them put off studying and homework until it is too late. Don't let the Math scare you, or make you feel bad. Math can be hard to learn, but you can do it.

, Whether or not  your teacher asks you to redo that homework assignment you forgot about (I know - your dog ate it), there is no substitute for actually doing the work. You certainly won't pass the quiz on Tuesday's material if you don't understand Monday's lecture because you were busy Friday night. Doing old tests and homework may also serve as a good review prior to a big test! Also, keep in mind that old tests and exams can help you get better at math.

, If you do, go back and do the work yourself until you understand it. It may look great if you get a 95% on that quiz, but you're still going to bomb the next test. Sure it's an old method, but the only person you hurt by cheating is yourself.

, Make sure that you know what will be on each test, and practice those kinds of problems. Ask your teacher for a sample test. Study for the tests with your ""study buddy."" Get a good night's sleep before each test, too.

, Try studying a little bit every night until the test. If you try to study the night before, you probably will forget everything and be tired and unprepared. The best idea is to just review key ideas and such the day before and morning of.

, Math is not like other subjects such as English and Science or other languages. It isn't a subject to be by hearted, it needs practice. Practice Math daily for an hour. Concentrate and pay attention on what you are doing and understand what Math really is.

, Calculators should be used only to check your answers. If you use calculators, it isn't your brain that is thinking to do the problem, the calculator is doing the whole job. If you use a calculator, it is hard to become good at Math. Use calculators only to check your answers. Unless it is geometry, like finding the angle of a triangle or finding the root of a large number.

, Do them right after your class or right after school when the lesson is still fresh in your mind. They are a great way to practice Math.

, Multiplication tables are very important during higher classes. It is better to learn them by heart at an early age at least 1-11 tables. It must be told even when you are asleep.

, Formulae are really important during some lessons. If you forget it, the whole lesson might be of no use. So it is important to learn formulae through practicing and not by heart. Don't just learn the formulae, but conceptually understand why the formulae work.

, Understand what each lesson is trying to tell you about. Algebra consists of only using Mathematical language to find a number. Negative numbers are just below zero and need a minus sign. Geometry is just to draw some figures. All these are just simple. Learn each lesson completely without any doubt. See that you know and understand everything.

, Try to learn math through various Math games and activities with friends and companions. You might see that this is an interesting and fun way to learn Math. And there are various websites that offer free Math games and activities too. Try them out.

, Math is fun and interesting of all the other subjects, and one of the important ones, too.

Do the math.,
Look at the formula.Slovin's formula is a very general equation used when you can estimate the population but have no idea about how a certain population behaves.,
Plug in the numbers.,
Do the math.",How to Calculate Sample Size," Population size refers to the total number of people within your demographic. For larger studies, you can use an approximated value instead of the precise number.


Precision has a greater statistical impact when you work with a smaller group. For instance, if you wish to perform a survey among members of a local organization or employees of a small business, the population size should be accurate within a dozen or so people.
Larger surveys allow for a greater deviance in the actual population. For example, if your demographic includes everyone living in the United States, you could estimate the size to roughly 320 million people, even though the actual value may vary by hundreds of thousands.;
, Margin of error, also referred to as ""confidence interval,"" refers to the amount of error you wish to allow in your results.The margin of error is a percentage the indicates how close your sample results will be to the true value of the overall population discussed in your study.
Smaller margin of errors will result in more accurate answers, but choosing a smaller margin of error will also require a larger sample.
When the results of a survey are presented, the margin of error usually appears as a plus or minus percentage. For example: ""35% of people agree with option A, with a margin of error of +/- 5%""

In this example, the margin of error essentially indicates that, if the entire population were asked the same poll question, you are “confident” that somewhere between 30% (35 - 5) and 40% (35 + 5) would agree with option A.



, Confidence level is closely related to confidence interval (margin of error). This value measures your degree of certainty regarding how well a sample represents the overall population within your chosen margin of error.


In other words, choosing a confidence level of 95% allows you to claim that you 95% certain that your results accurately fall within your chosen margin of error.
A larger confidence level indicates a greater degree of accuracy, but it will also require a larger sample. The most common confidence levels are 90% confident, 95% confident, and 99% confident.
Setting a confidence level of 95% for the example stated in the margin of error step would mean that you are 95% certain that 30% to 40% of the total concerned population would agree with option A of your survey.

, The standard of deviation indicates how much variation you expect among your responses.


Extreme answers are more likely to be accurate than moderate results.

Plainly stated, if 99% of your survey responses answer ""Yes"" and only 1% answer ""No,"" the sample probably represents the overall population very accurately.
On the other hand, if 45% answer ""Yes"" and 55% answer ""No,"" there is a greater chance of error.


Since this value is difficult to determine before you give the actual survey, most researchers set this value at 0.5 (50%). This is the worst case scenario percentage, so sticking with this value will guarantee that your calculated sample size is large enough to accurately represent the overall population within your confidence interval and confidence level.

, The Z-score is a constant value automatically set based on your confidence level. It indicates the ""standard normal score,"" or the number of standard deviations between any selected value and the average/mean of the population.


You can calculate z-scores by hand, look for an online calculator, or find your z-score on a z-score table. Each of these methods can be fairly complex, however.
Since confidence levels are fairly standardized, most researchers simply memorize the necessary z-score for the most common confidence levels:

80% confidence => 1.28 z-score
85% confidence => 1.44 z-score
90% confidence => 1.65 z-score
95% confidence => 1.96 z-score
99% confidence => 2.58 z-score



, The standard formula for sample size is:



Sample Size = / e2 / 1 + / e2 * N]


N = population size

z = z-score

e = margin of error

p = standard of deviation



, Replace the variable placeholders with the numerical values that actually apply to your specific survey.



Example: Determine the ideal survey size for a population size of 425 people. Use a 99% confidence level, a 50% standard of deviation, and a 5% margin of error.
For 99% confidence, you would have a z-score of 2.58.
This means that:


N = 425

z = 2.58

e = 0.05

p = 0.5



, Solve the equation using the newly inserted numerical values. The solution represents your necessary sample size.



Example: Sample Size = / e2 / 1 + / e2 * N]
= / 0.052 / 1 + / 0.052 * 425]

= / 0.0025 / 1 + / 1.0625]

= 665 / 1.5663
= 424.56 (final answer)




, If you still have values for the remainder of the variables, use the equation:



Sample Size = / e2


z = z-score

e = margin of error

p = standard of deviation


Note that this equation is merely the top half of the full formula.

, Replace each variable placeholder with the numerical values chosen for your survey.



Example: Determine the necessary survey size for an unknown population with a 90% confidence level, 50% standard of deviation, a 3% margin of error.
For 90% confidence, use the z-score would be 1.65.
This means that:


z = 1.65

e = 0.03

p = 0.5



, After plugging you numbers into the formula, solve the equation. Your answer will indicate your necessary sample size.



Example: Sample Size = / e2
= / 0.032

= / 0.0009
= 0.6806 / 0.0009
= 756.22 (final answer)




, The formula is described as:



Sample Size = N / (1 + N*e2)


N = population size

e = margin of error


Note that this is the least accurate formula and, as such, the least ideal. You should only use this if circumstances prevent you from determining an appropriate standard of deviation and/or confidence level (thereby preventing you from determining your z-score, as well).

, Replace each variable placeholder with the numerical values that apply specifically to your survey.



Example: Calculate the necessary survey size for a population of 240, allowing for a 4% margin of error.
This means that:


N = 240

e = 0.04



, Solve the equation using your survey-specific numbers. The answer you arrive at should be your necessary survey size.



Example: Sample Size = N / (1 + N*e2)

= 240 / (1 + 240 * 0.042)
= 240 / (1 + 240 * 0.0016)
= 240 / (1 + 0.384}
= 240 / (1.384)
= 173.41 (final answer)

Make an estimate.,
Use a calculator.,
Use the inverse operation.",How to Check Math Problems Easily1," This can help you check that your answer is reasonable. To estimate, round whatever numbers you are working with to numbers that you can easily manipulate in your head. Then perform the calculation and note the estimated value. When you complete the calculations using the actual numbers, compare how close your answer is to your estimate. If it is in the ballpark of your estimate, you know your calculations are likely correct.For example, if you are calculating 11,876÷39{\displaystyle 11,876\div 39}, you can round 11,876 up to 12,000, and 39 up to 40. Then, you can calculate in your head using basic math facts that 12,000÷40=300{\displaystyle 12,000\div 40=300}. Then complete you exact calculation. If you get that 11,876÷39=304{\displaystyle 11,876\div 39=304}, remainder 20{\displaystyle 20}, you can see that your answer and estimate are close, and therefore your calculation is likely correct.
;
, You shouldn’t use a calculator to complete your math work, unless your teacher tells you it is okay. However, there is nothing wrong with using a calculator to check your answer once you have finished calculating.

If you discover with the calculator that your answer is incorrect, don’t simply change your answer. Go back through your work and see where you made a mistake in the calculating process, then show the necessary work needed to find the right answer.

If you don’t show your work on a math problem, your teacher might think you did everything on a calculator and won’t give you any credit.  


, Inverse operations are opposite operations that undo one another. Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. Multiplication and division are inverse operations. You can create true equations with the same three numbers using inverse operations.For example, if you find that 560÷16=35{\displaystyle 560\div 16=35}, you should be able to make a multiplication problem with the same three numbers by multiplying the divisor (the number you are dividing by) by the product: 16×35=560{\displaystyle 16\times 35=560}. If the equation you make with the inverse operation is true, then your calculation is correct.


"
"
Plug the solution back into the equation.,
Double-check the order of operations.,
Double-check signs.,
Set the work aside.,
Use an algebra calculator.",How to Check Math Problems Easily2," This is the simplest way to check that your answer is correct. If you solved for a variable or multiple variables, plug these solutions back into the equation and see if they make the equation true. If they do, then the solutions are correct. If the resulting equation isn’t true, then you know you’ve made a mistake in your calculations.For example, if you are working with the equation 4x=24+6x{\displaystyle 4x=24+6x}, and you find that x=12{\displaystyle x=12}, substitute 12 into the equation for x{\displaystyle x} to see if it makes the equation true:4(12)=24+6(12){\displaystyle 4(12)=24+6(12)}48=24+72{\displaystyle 48=24+72}48=96{\displaystyle 48=96}Since the equation isn’t true, you know that 12 isn’t the correct solution, and you need to go back and check your work.


, Look back through your work and make sure that you completed all of your calculations in the correct order. You can recall the acronym  PEMDAS to remember parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.

For example, if you are solving the equation 3(2x+3)+14−2(42){\displaystyle 3(2x+3)+14-2(4^{2})} and you go back and see that your first step was to subtract 2 from 14, you know your answer is wrong, because you should have calculated the values in parentheses and exponents first, and then completed multiplication, before you did any adding and subtracting.


, A common error in algebra is making mistakes when working with positive and negative values.Go over your work again, and keep in mind the following rules about positive and negative signs:

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding it.(3−(−7)=3+7=10{\displaystyle 3-(-7)=3+7=10})Adding two negative numbers together results in a negative number. (−3+−7=−10{\displaystyle -3+-7=-10})

A negative time a negative equals a positive.(−3×−7=21{\displaystyle -3\times -7=21})

A negative times a positive equals a negative.(−3×7=−21{\displaystyle -3\times 7=-21})The variable −x{\displaystyle -x} is not necessarily negative. The negative sign indicates that it is the opposite of whatever x{\displaystyle x} is. So, if x{\displaystyle x} is positive, −x{\displaystyle -x} is negative. If x{\displaystyle x} is negative, −x{\displaystyle -x} is positive., It helps to check your work with fresh eyes. If you have a problem that is giving you a lot of trouble, set it aside for a few hours, then come back to it later. On a separate sheet of paper, try reworking the problem without going over your original work. If possible, use a different method to solve this time. If your original solution and the new one match, you can be confident that your answer is correct., There are a number of calculators available online that allow you to type in your work, including variables, and calculate the solution. Most calculators also show you the steps needed in order to arrive at the solution. Some good sites for algebra calculators include Symbolaband Mathway.As when using a regular calculator, don’t use an algebra calculator to do your work for you. Do the problems first, then use the algebra calculator to check your solutions. If your answer is incorrect, go back and rework the problem; don’t just copy the solution from the calculator.

Re-read the problem.,
Check keywords and numbers against your calculations.,
Check for reasonableness.",How to Check Math Problems Easily3," Make sure you completely understand what you are trying to find.  Wordy math problems can sometimes be confusing, so re-read carefully to make sure you were solving the right problem. Also double-check that you understood what the information in the problem meant.For example: “Fred picks 8 apples on Sunday, and 6 apples on Monday. George picks 2 more apples than Fred each day. Charlie picks 5 less apples than George on Sunday, and 1 more apple on Friday. How many apples does George pick?” Here, make sure to solve for the amount of apples George picks, not the amount Charlie picks or the amount all of them pick together. Also, make sure you understand all of the details of the problem. For example, each day, George picks 2 more than Fred’s daily total. He doesn’t pick 2 more than Fred’s 2-day total.


, Word problems are full of keywords that help you translate the words into math. Highlight these keywords in the problem. Also highlight the numbers. Then, go back to your calculations and double check that the operations and numbers in your calculations match what is presented in the problem.

Some common keywords include “combined” (addition), “decreased” (subtraction), “of” (multiplication), and “per” (division).For example: “Carlos has 15 books per book shelf. He has 120 books. How many shelves does he have?” The key word “per” should tell you this is a division problem. If you go back to your work and see that you calculated 15×120{\displaystyle 15\times 120}, you know that you did the wrong calculation.


, Think about the information in the problem and the solution you are trying to find. Decide whether your answer should be bigger than the numbers represented in the problem, or smaller. Think about whether your answer should be a whole number. If your solution has a remainder or a decimal, make sure that it makes sense in the context of the story problem.

For example: “Mr. Ripley needs to book buses for the fourth grade field trip. Each bus fits 52 people. He has 30 students. The two other fourth grade teachers have 28 students and 26 students, respectively. There will also be 3 adults chaperoning each class, plus the 3 teachers. How many buses does Mr. Ripley need to book for the field trip?” If you add up all of the people going on the field trip (96), and divide by the number of people that fit on one bus (52), you get 1.846. But Mr. Ripley can’t book eight-tenths of a bus. So, if you put down 1.846 as your answer to this problem, you know it is not a reasonable answer. You need to round up your answer to 2.

List the elements of your data set.,
Identify the highest and lowest numbers in the set.,
Subtract the smallest number in your data set from the largest number.,
Label the range clearly.",How to Calculate Range," To find the range of a set, you'll need to list all of the elements of the set so that you can identify the highest and lowest numbers. Write down all of the elements. The numbers in this set are: 14, 19, 20, 24, 25, and 28.


It can be easier to identify the highest and lowest number in the set if you list the numbers in ascending order. In this example, the set would be rearranged like this: 14, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 28.
Listing the elements of the set in order can also help you make other calculations, such as finding the mode, mean, or median of the set.;
, In this case, the lowest number in the set is 14 and the highest number is 28.

, Now that you've identified the smallest and largest numbers in the set, all you have to do is subtract them from each other. Subtract 14 from 28 (28 - 14) to get 14, the range of the set.

, Once you've found the range, label it clearly. This will help you avoid confusing it with any other statistical calculations that you may need to make for the set, such as finding the median, mode, or mean.

Ask, in class, for clarification of a particular concept. If the answer doesn't really shed any light on the subject, speak to the teacher after class. They may have some suggestions, one-on-one, that they couldn't go into during regular class time.;
, Math, beyond simple addition and subtraction, is generally a collection of separate operations. For example, multiplication also involves addition, and division also involves subtraction. Before you can grasp a concept completely, you need to understand the meaning of all the operations involved. For each word used in a math problem (for example, ""variable,"") try this:


Memorize the definition from the book. ""A symbol for a number we don't know yet. It is usually a letter like x or y.""
Practice examples of the concept. For example, ""4x - 7 = 5,"" where x is the variable, while 7 and 5 are ""constants"" 4 is a coefficient of x (another two definitions to look up).

, Properties, formulas, equations, and methods are the tools of math, and will make math and computation much easier when you understand all the tools work. Learn to rely on them like a good carpenter would his saw, tape measure, hammer, etc.

, If you don't know the answer to a question, ask for clarification. Explain what you do understand, so that the teacher can focus on the parts that are confusing.


For example, using the variable problem above, say ""I understand that 4 times an unknown variable (x), minus 7, equals 5. What's the first thing I need to do?"" Now the teacher knows how to help bring you into the discussion. If you had said, ""I don't get it,"" the teacher might think they need to explain constants and variables first.
Never be afraid to ask questions. Even Einstein asked questions (and then answered them)! You're not going to suddenly understand it by staring at the problem. If you don't want to ask a teacher, ask a nearby student, or friend.

, If you still need help, and the teacher is unable to explain things in a way you understand, ask them who they would recommend for more in-depth assistance. Find out if there is a study hall or tutoring program, or ask if a teacher could give you extra help before or after class.


Just as there are different learning styles (auditory, visual, etc.), there are different teaching styles. If you're a visual learner, and have the best teacher in the world—for auditory learners—you will still find it difficult to learn from them. It's not impossible, but having supplemental help from somebody who teaches the same way you learn will be a great help.

, For example, when working out equations, divide your solution into steps, writing down what you did you get to the next step.


Writing out your work helps you to keep track of the work as you do it, and it may help you get partial credit if you make a mistake somewhere.
Writing your steps out will show you where you went wrong.
Writing your steps out will also help reinforce and strengthen what you already know.

, After attempting a few examples, you may get the hang of it. If not, you'll have a better idea of where you are getting hung up.

, Read the teacher's notes, and learn where you went wrong. Ask your teacher to help you review any problems you still don't understand.

Count your full data set.,
Count each result.,
Divide each result by the total size of the set.,
Present your results in a frequency table.,
Report items that do not appear.,
Show your results as percentages.",How to Calculate Relative Frequency," Unless you are just completing a math homework assignment, calculating relative frequency generally implies that you have some form of data. Conduct your experiment or study and collect the data. Decide how precisely you wish to report your results.

For example, suppose you are collecting data on the ages of people who attend a particular movie. You could decide to collect and report the exact age of everyone who attends. But this is likely to give you 60 or 70 different results, being every number from about 10 through 70 or 80. You may instead wish to collect data in groups, like “Under 20,” “20-29,” “30-39,” “40-49,” “50-59,” and “60 plus.” This would be a more manageable set of six data groups.

As another example, a doctor might collect body temperatures of patients on a given day. In this case, just collecting whole numbers, like 97, 98, 99, might not be precise enough. It might be necessary to report data in decimals in this case.
;
, After you complete your study or experiment, you are likely to have a collection of data values that could look like 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 4, 3, 7, 1, 5, 6, 5, 3, 4, 5, 1. In this form, the data appear almost meaningless and difficult to use. It is more helpful to sort the data in order from lowest to highest. This would result in the list 1,1,1,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,7.When you are sorting and rewriting your collection of data, be careful to include every point correctly. Count the data set to make sure you do not leave off any values.


, You can summarize the results of your data collection by creating a simple data frequency table. This is a chart with three columns that you will use for your relative frequency calculations. Label the columns as follows:x{\displaystyle x}. This column will be filled with each value that appears in your data set. Do not repeat items. For example, if the value 4 appears several times in the list, just put 4{\displaystyle 4} under the x{\displaystyle x} column once.


n{\displaystyle n}, n(x){\displaystyle n(x)} or fr(x){\displaystyle fr(x)}. In statistics, the variable n{\displaystyle n} is conventionally used to represent the count of a particular value. You may also write n(x){\displaystyle n(x)}, which is read as “n of x,” and means the count of each x-value. A final alternative is fr(x){\displaystyle fr(x)}, which means the “frequency of x.” In this column, you will put the number of times that the value appears. For example, if the number 4 appears three times, you will place a 3 next to the number 4.

Relative Frequency or P(x){\displaystyle P(x)}. This final column is where you will record the relative frequency of each data item or grouping. The label P(x){\displaystyle P(x)}, which is read “P of x,” could mean the probability of x or the percentage of x. The calculation of relative frequency appears below. This column will be used after you complete that calculation for each value of x.


, Relative frequency is a measure of the number of times a particular value results, as a fraction of the full set. In order to calculate relative frequency, you need to know how many data points you have in your full data set. The will become the denominator in the fraction that you use for calculating.In the sample data set provided above, counting each item results in 16 total data points.


, You need to determine the number of times that each data point appears in your results. You may want to calculate the relative frequency of one particular item, or you may be summarizing the overall data for the full data set.For example, in the data set provided above, consider the value 4{\displaystyle 4}. This value appears three times in the list. 


, This is the final calculation to determine the relative frequency of each item. You can set it up as a fraction or use a calculator or spreadsheet to perform the division.Continuing with the example above, because the value 4{\displaystyle 4} appears three times, and the full set contains 16 items, you can determine that the relative frequency of the value 4{\displaystyle 4} is 3/16. This is equal to a decimal result of 0.1875.


, The frequency table that you began above can be used to present the results in a format that is easy to review. As you perform each of the calculations, fill in the results in the corresponding places in the table. It is common to round your answers to two decimal places, although you will need to decide this for yourself based on the needs of your study. Because of rounding the end result may total something close to , but not exactly 1.0.For example, using the data set above, the relative frequency table would appear as follows:

  x  :  n(x)  :  P(x)

  1  :   3   :   0.19

  2  :   1   :   0.06

  3  :   2   :   0.13

  4  :   3   :   0.19

  5  :   4   :   0.25

  6  :   2   :   0.13

  7  :   1   :   0.06

total  :  16   :   1.01


, It may be just as meaningful to report items whose frequency is 0 as to report those items that do appear in your data set. Look at the kind of data you are collecting, and if you notice any gaps in your sorted data, you may need to report them as 0s.

For example, the sample data set you have been working with includes all values from 1 to 7. But suppose that the number 3 never appeared. That could be important, and you would report the relative frequency of the value 3 as 0.


, You may wish to turn your decimal results into percentages. This is a common practice, as relative frequency is often used as a predictor of the percentage of times that some value will occur. To convert a decimal number to a percentage, simply shift the decimal point two spaces to the right, and add a percent symbol.

For example, the decimal result of 0.13 is equal to 13%.

The decimal result of 0.06 is equal to 6%. (Don’t just skip over the 0.)

Subtract the real number from your number.,
Divide the result by the real number.,
Find the absolute value of the result.,
Multiply the result by 100.",How to Calculate Percentage Error," The formula for calculating percentage error is simple:'x 100


The approximate value is the estimated value, and the exact value is the real value. Once you find the absolute value of the difference between the approximate value and exact value, all you need to do is to divide it by the exact value and multiply the result by 100.;
, This means that you should subtract the real value from the estimated value. In this case, the real value is 10 and the estimated value is 9.


Ex: 10 - 9 = 1

, Simply divide -1, the result when 10 is subtracted from 9, by 10, the real value. Place the fraction in decimal form.


Ex:-1/10 = -0.1

, The absolute value of a number is the value of the positive value of the number, whether it's positive or negative. The absolute value of a positive number is the number itself and the absolute value of a negative number is simply the value of the number without the negative sign, so the negative number becomes positive.


Ex: |-0.1| = 0.1

, Simply multiply the result, 0.1, by 100. This will convert the answer into percent form. Just add the percentage symbol to the answer and you're done.


Ex: 0.1 x 100 = 10%

Determine your experiment's degrees of freedom.,
Compare expected results to observed results with chi square.,
Choose a significance level.,
Use a chi square distribution table to approximate your p-value.,
Decide whether to reject or keep your null hypothesis.",How to Calculate P Value," Usually, when scientists conduct an experiment and observe the results, they have an idea of what ""normal"" or ""typical"" results will look like beforehand. This can be based on past experimental results, trusted sets of observational data, scientific literature, and/or other sources. For your experiment, determine your expected results and express them as a number.


Example: Let's say prior studies have shown that, nationally, speeding tickets are given more often to red cars than they are to blue cars. Let's say the average results nationally show a 2:1 preference for red cars. We want to find out whether or not the police in our town also demonstrate this bias by analyzing speeding tickets given by our town's police. If we take a random pool of 150 speeding tickets given to either red or blue cars in our town, we would expect 100 to be for red cars and 50 to be for blue cars if our town's police force gives tickets according to the national bias.;
, Now that you've determined your expected values, you can conduct your experiment and find your actual (or ""observed"") values. Again, express these results as numbers. If we manipulate some experimental condition and the observed results differ from this expected results, two possibilities are possible: either this happened by chance, or our manipulation of experimental variables caused the difference. The purpose of finding a p-value is basically to determine whether the observed results differ from the expected results to such a degree that the ""null hypothesis"" - the hypothesis that there is no relationship between the experimental variable(s) and the observed results - is unlikely enough to reject


Example: Let's say that, in our town, we randomly selected 150 speeding tickets which were given to either red or blue cars. We found that 90 tickets were for red cars and 60 were for blue cars. These differ from our expected results of 100 and 50, respectively. Did our experimental manipulation (in this case, changing the source of our data from a national one to a local one) cause this change in results, or are our town's police as biased as the national average suggests, and we're just observing a chance variation? A p value will help us determine this.

, Degrees of freedom are a measure the amount of variability involved in the research, which is determined by the number of categories you are examining. The equation for degrees of freedom is Degrees of freedom = n-1, where ""n"" is the number of categories or variables being analyzed in your experiment.


Example: Our experiment has two categories of results: one for red cars and one for blue cars. Thus, in our experiment, we have 2-1 = 1 degree of freedom. If we had compared red, blue, and green cars, we would have 2 degrees of freedom, and so on.

, Chi square(written ""x2"") is a numerical value that measures the difference between an experiment's expected and observed values. The equation for chi square is: x2 = Σ((o-e)2/e), where ""o"" is the observed value and ""e"" is the expected value.Sum the results of this equation for all possible outcomes (see below).


Note that this equation includes a Σ (sigma) operator. In other words, you'll need to calculate ((|o-e|-.05)2/e) for each possible outcome, then add the results to get your chi square value. In our example, we have two outcomes - either the car that received a ticket is red or blue. Thus, we would calculate ((o-e)2/e) twice - once for red cars and once for blue cars.
Example: Let's plug our expected and observed values into the equation x2 = Σ((o-e)2/e). Keep in mind that, because of the sigma operator, we'll need to perform ((o-e)2/e) twice - once for red cars and once for blue cars. Our work would go as follows:

x2 = ((90-100)2/100) + (60-50)2/50)
x2 = ((-10)2/100) + (10)2/50)
x2 = (100/100) + (100/50) = 1 + 2 = 3 .



, Now that we know our experiment's degrees of freedom and our chi square value, there's just one last thing we need to do before we can find our p value - we need to decide on a significance level. Basically, the significance level is a measure of how certain we want to be about our results - low significance values correspond to a low probability that the experimental results happened by chance, and vice versa. Significance levels are written as a decimal (such as 0.01), which corresponds to the percent chance that random sampling would produce a difference as large as the one you observed if there was no underlying difference in the populations.


It is a common misconception that p=0.01 means that there is a 99% chance that the results were caused by the scientist's manipulation of experimental variables. This is NOT the case. If you wore your lucky pants on seven different days and the stock market went up every one of those days, you would have p<0.01, but you would still be well-justified in believing that the result had been generated by chance rather than by a connection between the market and your pants.
By convention, scientists usually set the significance value for their experiments at 0.05, or 5 percent.This means that experimental results that meet this significance level have, at most, a 5% chance of being reproduced in a random sampling process. For most experiments, generating results that are that unlikely to be produced by a random sampling process is seen as ""successfully"" showing a correlation between the change in the experimental variable and the observed effect.
Example: For our red and blue car example, let's follow scientific convention and set our significance level at 0.05.

, Scientists and statisticians use large tables of values to calculate the p value for their experiment. These tables are generally set up with the vertical axis on the left corresponding to degrees of freedom and the horizontal axis on the top corresponding to p-value. Use these tables by first finding your degrees of freedom, then reading that row across from the left to the right until you find the first value bigger than your chi square value. Look at the corresponding p value at the top of the column - your p value is between this value and the next-largest value (the one immediately to the left of it.)


Chi square distribution tables are available from a variety of sources - they can easily be found online or in science and statistics textbooks. If you don't have one handy, use the one in the photo above or a free online table, like the one provided by medcalc.org here.

Example: Our chi-square was 3. So, let's use the chi square distribution table in the photo above to find an approximate p value. Since we know our experiment has only 1 degree of freedom, we'll start in the highest row. We'll go from left to right along this row until we find a value higher than 3 - our chi square value. The first one we encounter is 3.84. Looking to the top of this column, we see that the corresponding p value is 0.05. This means that our p value is between 0.05 and 0.1 (the next-biggest p value on the table).

, Since you have found an approximate p value for your experiment, you can decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis of your experiment (as a reminder, this is the hypothesis that the experimental variables you manipulated did not affect the results you observed.) If your p value is lower than your significance value, congratulations - you've shown that your experimental results would be highly unlikely to occur if there was no real connection between the variables you manipulated and the effect you observed. If your p value is higher than your significance value, you can't confidently make that claim.


Example: Our p value is between 0.05 and 0.1 . It is not smaller than 0.05, so, unfortunately, we can't reject our null hypothesis. This means that we didn't reach the criterion we decided upon to be able to say that our town's police give tickets to red and blue cars at a rate that's significantly different than the national average.
In other words, random sampling from the national data would produce a result 10 tickets off from the national average 5-10% of the time. Since we were looking for this percentage to be less than 5%, we can't say that we're sure our town's police are less biased towards red cars.

Don't fall prey to common gambling fallacies.",How to Calculate Odds," Let's say we're in a gambling mood but all we have to play with is one simple six-sided die. In this case, we'll just wager bets on what number the die will show after we roll it. Let's say we bet that we'll roll either a one or a two. In this case, there's two possibilities where we win - if the dice shows a two, we win, and if the dice shows a one, we also win. Thus, there are two favorable outcomes.;
, In a game of chance, there's always a chance that you won't win. If we bet that we'll roll either a one or a two, that means we'll lose if we roll a three, four, five, or six. Since there are four ways that we can lose, that means that there are four unfavorable outcomes.


Another way to think of this is as the Number of total outcomes minus the number of favorable outcomes. When rolling a die, there are a total of six possible outcomes - one for each number on the die. In our example, then, we would subtract two (the number of desired outcomes) from six. 6 - 2 = 4 unfavorable outcomes.

Similarly, you may subtract the number of unfavorable outcomes from the total number of outcomes to find the number of favorable outcomes.

, Generally, odds are expressed as the ratio of favorable outcomes to unfavorable outcomes, often using a colon. In our example, our odds of success would be 2 : 4 - two chances that we'll win versus four chances that we'll lose. Like a fraction, this can be simplified to 1 : 2 by dividing both terms by the common multiple of 2. This ratio is written (in words) as ""one to two odds.""


You may choose to represent this ratio as a fraction. In this case, our odds are 2/4, simplified as 1/2. Note - 1/2 odds don't mean we have a one-half (50%) chance of winning. In fact, we have a one-third chance of winning. Remember when expressing odds that odds are a ratio of favorable outcomes to unfavorable outcomes - not a numerical measurement of how likely we are to win.

, The 1 : 2 odds we just calculated are the odds in favor of us winning. What if we want to know the odds of losing, also called the odds against us winning? To find the odds against us, simply flip the ratio of odds in favor of winning. 1 : 2 becomes 2 : 1.


If you express the odds against winning as a fraction, you get 2/1. Remember, as above, that this isn't an expression of how likely you are to lose, but rather the ratio of unfavorable outcomes to favorable outcomes. If it were an expression of how likely you were to lose, you'd have a 200% chance of losing, which is obviously impossible. How do you like those odds? In reality, you have a 66% chance of losing - 2 chances to lose and 1 chance to win means 2 losses / 3 total outcomes = .66 = 66%

, The concepts of odds and probability are related, but not identical. Probability is simply a representation of the chance that a given outcome will happen. This is found by dividing the number of desired outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. In our example, the probability (not odds) that we'll roll a one or a two (out of six possible die roll outcomes) is 2 / 6 = 1 / 3 = .33 = 33%. So our 1 : 2 odds of winning translate to a 33% chance that we'll win.


It's easy to convert between probability and odds. To find an odds ratio from a given probability, first express the probability as a fraction (we'll use 5/13). Subtract the numerator (5) from the denominator (13) : 13 - 5 = 8 . The answer is the number of unfavorable outcomes. Odds can then be expressed as 5 : 8 - the ratio of favorable to unfavorable outcomes.
To find probability from a given odds ratio, first express your odds as a fraction (we'll use 9 / 21 ). Add the numerator (9) and denominator (21) : 9 + 21 = 30. The answer is the total number of outcomes. Probability can be expressed as 9/30 = 3/10 = 30% - the number of favorable outcomes over the number of total possible outcomes.A simple formula for calculating odds from probability is O = P / (1 - P). A formula for calculating probability from odds is P = O / (O + 1)., In certain scenarios, odds for a given event will change based on the results of past events. For example, if you have a jar full of twenty marbles, four of which are red and sixteen of which are green, you'll have 4 : 16 (1 : 4) odds to draw a red marble at random. Let's say you draw a green marble. If you don't put the marble back into the jar, on your next attempt, you'll have 4 : 15 odds to draw a red marble. Then, if you draw a red marble, you'll have 3 : 15 (1 : 5) odds on the following attempt. Drawing a red marble is a dependent event - the odds depend on which marbles have been drawn before.



Independent events are events whose odds aren't effected by previous events. Flipping a coin and getting a heads is an independent event - you're not more likely to get a heads based on whether you got a heads or a tails last time.

, If we roll one die, it's equally likely that we'll get any of the numbers 1 - 6. However, if we roll two dice and add their numbers together, though there's a chance we'll get anything from 2 to 12, not every outcome is equally likely. There's only one way to make 2 - by rolling two 1's - and there's only one way to make 12 - by rolling two 6's. By contrast, there are many ways to make a seven. For instance, you could roll a 1 and a 6, a 2 and a 5, a 3 and a 4, and so on. In this case, the odds for each sum should reflect the fact that some outcomes are more likely than others.


Let's do an example problem. To calculate the odds of rolling two dice with a sum of four (for instance, a 1 and a 3), begin by calculating the total number of outcomes. Each individual dice has six outcomes. Take the number of outcomes for each die to the power of the number of dice: 6(number of sides on each die)2(number of dice) = 36 possible outcomes. Next, find the number of ways you can make four with two dice: you can roll a 1 and a 3, a 2 and a 2, or a 3 and a 1 - three ways. So the odds of rolling a combined ""four"" with two dice are 3 : (36-3) = 3 : 33 = 1 : 11

Odds change exponentially based on the number of events occurring simultaneously. Your odds of rolling a ""yahtzee"" (five dice that are all the same number) in one roll are very slim - 6 : 65 - 6 = 6 : 7770 = 1 : 1295!


, Sometimes, certain outcomes can overlap - the odds you calculate should reflect this. For instance, if you're playing poker and you have a nine, ten, jack, and queen of diamonds in your hand, you want your next card either to be a king or eight of any suit (to make a straight), or, alternatively, any diamond (to make a flush.) Let's say the dealer is dealing your next card from a standard fifty-two card deck. There are thirteen diamonds in the deck, four kings, and four eights. However, the total number of favorable outcomes isn't 13 + 4 + 4 = 21. The thirteen diamonds already includes the king and eight of diamonds - we don't want to count them twice. The actual number of favorable outcomes is 13 + 3 + 3 = 19. Thus, the odds of being dealt a card that will give you a straight or flush are 19 : (52 - 19) or 19 : 33. Not bad!


In real life, of course, if you already have cards in your hand, you're rarely being dealt cards from a complete fifty-two card deck. Keep in mind that the number of cards in the deck decreases as cards are dealt. Also, if you're playing with other people, you'll have to guess what cards they have when you're estimating your odds. This is part of the fun of poker.

, If you're venturing into the world of gambling, it's important to know that betting odds don't usually reflect the true mathematical ""odds"" of a certain event happening. Instead, gambling odds, especially in games like horse racing and sports betting, reflect the payout that a bookmaker will give on a successful bet. For instance, if you wager $100 on a horse with 20:1 odds against him, this doesn't mean that there are 20 outcomes where your horse loses and 1 where he wins. Rather, it means that you'll be paid 20 times your original wager - in this case, $2,000! To add to the confusion, the format for expressing these odds sometimes varies regionally. Here are a few non-standard ways that gambling odds are expressed:



Decimal (or ""European format"") odds. These are fairly easy to understand. Decimal odds are simply expressed as a decimal number, like 2.50. This number is the ratio of the payout to the original stake. For instance, with odds of 2.50, if you bet $100 and win, you'll receive $250 dollars - 2.5 times your original stake. In this case, you'll make a tidy profit of $150.

Fractional (or ""UK format"") odds. These are expressed as a fraction, like 1/4. This represents the ratio of the profit (not total payout) from a successful bet to the stake. For instance, if you bet $100 on something with 1/4 fractional odds and win, you'll profit by 1/4 of your original stake - in this case, your payout will be $125 for a profit of $25.

Moneyline (or ""US format"") odds. These can be difficult to understand. Moneyline odds are expressed as a number preceded by a minus sign or a plus sign, like -200 or +50. A minus sign means the number represents how much you need to wager to make $100. A positive sign means the number represents how much you'll win if you bet $100. Remember this subtle distinction! For example, if we wager $50 with moneyline odds of -200, when we win, we'll get a payout of $75 for a total profit of $25. If we wager $50 with moneyline odds of +200, we'll get a payout of $150 for a total profit of $100.

In moneyline odds, a simple ""100"" (no plus or minus) represents an even bet - whatever money you stake, you'll earn as profit if you win.



, The odds that bookmakers and casinos set aren't usually calculated from the mathematical probability that certain events will occur. Rather, they're carefully set so that, in the long run, the bookie or casino will make money, regardless of any short-term outcomes! Take this into account when making your bets - remember, eventually, the house always wins.


Let's look at an example. A standard roulette wheel has 38 numbers - 1 through 36, plus 0 and 00.. If you bet on one space (let's say 11 ), you have 1 : 37 odds of winning. However, the casino sets the payout odds at 35 : 1 - if the ball lands on 11, you'll win 35 times your original stake. Notice that the payout odds are slightly lower than the odds against you winning. If casinos weren't interested in making money, you would be paid out at 37 : 1 odds. However, by setting the payout odds slightly below the actual odds of you winning, the casino will gradually make money over time, even if it has to make the occasional large payout when the ball lands on 11.

, Gambling can be fun - even addictive. However, certain widely-circulated gambling strategies that at first appear to be ""common sense"" are, in fact, mathematically false. Below are just a few things you should keep in mind when you go gambling - don't lose more money than you have to!


You're never ""due"" to win. If you've been at the Texas Hold 'Em table for an hour and you haven't been dealt a single good hand, you may want to stay in the game in the hopes that a winning straight or flush is ""right around the corner."" Unfortunately, your odds don't change with the amount of time you've been gambling. The cards are randomly shuffled before every deal, so if you've had ten bad hands in a row, you're just as likely to get another bad hand as you are if you've had a hundred bad hands in a row. This extends to most other games of chance - roulette, slots, etc.
Sticking with one specific bet won't increase your odds. You may know someone who has ""lucky"" lotto numbers - though it can be fun to bet money on numbers that have special personal meaning, in random games of chance, you're never more likely to win by betting on the same thing every time than you are by betting on a different thing every time. Lottery numbers, slots, and roulette wheels are completely random. In roulette, for example, it's just as likely that you'll roll ""9"" three times in a row as it is that you'll roll any specific three numbers in order.
If you're one away from the winning number, you weren't ""close."" If you pick the number 41 for the lottery and the winning number is revealed as 42, you may feel absolutely crushed, but cheer up! You weren't even close. Two numbers that are close together, like 41 and 42, aren't mathematically connected in any way in random games of chance.

"
Note the number of dice, their sides, and the desired sum.

,
Enumerate all the ways that sum can be reached.,
Not all partitions listed in the previous step are equally likely.,
Add the total number of ways to get the desired sum.

,
Divide by the total number of outcomes.",How to Calculate Multiple Dice Probabilities2,", This can be tedious for large numbers of dice, but is fairly straightforward. This is equivalent to the finding all partitions of k into exactly n parts with no part larger than r. An example for n=5, r=6, and k=12 is shown as an example. In order to ensure that the count is both exhaustive and that no partition is counted twice, the partitions are presented in lexicographic order and the dice in each partition in non-decreasing order.

, This is why they must be listed, not simply counted. In a smaller 3 die example, the partition 123 covers 6 possibilities (123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321) while the partition 114 covers only 3 (114, 141, 411) and 222 only includes itself. Use the multinomial formula to compute the number of ways to permute the digits in each partition. This information has been added to the table from the previous section.

,, Since each die has r equally probable faces, this is simply rn.

"
"
Note the probabilities of the outcomes of a single die.,
In the column for 2 dice, use the formula shown.,
Likewise, for three or more dice, the same formula still applies, using the now known probabilities for each given sum on one die fewer.,
The spreadsheet shown computed ""number of ways"" not ""probability"", but converting between them is easy: probability = number of ways / r^n where r is number of sides on each die and n is the number of dice.",How to Calculate Multiple Dice Probabilities3," Record them in a spreadsheet. The example shown uses 6-sided dice. The blank rows for negative sums are treated as zeros and allow the same formula to be used in all rows.

, That is, the probability of 2 dice showing any sum k equals the sum of the following events. For very high or low values of k, some or all or these terms might be zero, but the formula is valid for all k.


First die shows k-1 and the second shows 1.
First die shows k-2 and the second shows 2.
First die shows k-3 and the second shows 3.
First die shows k-4 and the second shows 4.
First die shows k-5 and the second shows 5.
First die shows k-6 and the second shows 6.

, Thus, the formula entered in step two can be filled both down and across until the table includes as much data as required.

, Alternatively, the spreadsheet can be modified to compute probability directly.

"
Write the polynomial, (1/r)(x + x2 + ... + xr).,
Raise this polynomial to the nth power to get the corresponding generating function for the sum shown on n dice.,
Computationally, this is equivalent to the previous method, but sometimes theoretical results are easier to derive with a generating function.",How to Calculate Multiple Dice Probabilities4," This is the generating function for a single die. The coefficient of the xk term is the probability that the die shows k., That is compute (1/rn)(x + x2 + ... + xr)n. If n is larger than about 2, you'll probably want to do this on a computer., For example throwing two regular 6-sided dice has exactly the same distribution of sums as a die labeled (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4) and another labeled (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8). This is because (x+x2 +x2+x3+x3+x4)(x+x3 +x4+x5+x6+x8) = (x+x2 +x3+x4+x5+x6)(x+x2 +x3+x4+x5+x6).

For a large number of dice, exact computation by the above methods may be difficult.,
Compute the mean and standard variation based on the number and type of dice.,
Use the normal distribution with the above mean and standard deviation as an approximation of the sum of the dice.

",How to Calculate Multiple Dice Probabilities5," The central limit theorem states that the sum of a number of identical dice approaches a normal distribution as the number of dice increases.

, Assuming n dice numbered 1 to r, the formulas below apply.


The mean is (r+1)/2.
The variance is n(r^2-1)/12.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

(Although different letters are used in this example, you will use the same column letter for both the first and last cell if you entered the data in a column of cells or the same row number for both the first and last cell if you entered the data in a row of cells.)


You can also specify each cell individually, up to 255 cells, as in ""=MODE(A1, A2, A3),"" but this is not advisable unless you have only a very small dataset and do not plan to add to it. You can also use the function with constants, for example, ""=MODE(4,4,6),"" but this requires editing the function each time you wish to search for a different mode.
You may want to format the cell in which the mode will display with bolding or italics to distinguish it from the numbers in the dataset.

, This normally happens automatically in Excel, but if you have set up your spreadsheet for manual calculation, you'll need to press the F9 key to display the mode.


For a dataset of 10, 7, 9, 8, 7, 0 and 4 entered in cells 1 through 8 of Column A, the function =MODE(A1:A8) will deliver a result of 7, because 7 appears more often in the data than any other number.
If the data set contains more than one number that qualifies as the mode (such as 7 and 9 each appearing twice and every other number appearing only once), whichever mode number is listed first in the data set will be the result. If none of the numbers in the data set appear more often than any other, the MODE function will display the error result #N/A.
The MODE function is available in all versions of Excel, including Excel 2010, which includes it for compatibility with spreadsheets created in earlier versions. Excel 2010 uses the MODE.SNGL function, which except for syntax (=MODE.SNGL(Cx:Dy)) works essentially the same as the MODE function in earlier versions of Excel.

Decide whose lives you want to put a value on.,
Decide on a methodology.,
In all cases, the statistical methods will need to be applied to isolate the statistical value of life, defined as the change in wealth divided by change in risk.,
Consider if a value of life is the best thing to measure.",How to Calculate Human Life Value," The value of life is not a constant across all individuals. An estimate derived from Canadian labor markets should not be used to infer a value of life in Japan.;
, Generally this will involve finding some sort of risk that people will pay to prevent or accept money to subject themselves to. Almost any risk can be used although the value of life may not be a constant. That is, you might find that people are willing to pay more to protect themselves against dying from cancer than from drowning. There are at least three general approaches here:


Individual survey: This requires calling up random people and presenting them with a hypothetical risk-money scenario. For example, ""Suppose your doctor tells you about an early test for colon cancer. The test is safe and painless, and detects cancers when they are 90% curable. Other tests can't detect the cancer until it is 70% curable. The test costs $2000 and is not covered by insurance. Do you get the test?"" Careful survey design is needed to avoid accidentally introducing biases in the sample or influencing their responses. The main problem with this method is that it is hypothetical.Other approaches look at what people actually do in real life situations involving a risk-money trade-off.
Labor market analysis: This involves developing a model for the wages dependent on the the risks of the job and other factors. Other things being equal, workers will demand a higher wage in order to accept a job that involves subjecting themselves to additional health risks. Viscusi and Aldi's 2003 meta-analysis compares many labor market studies using different data sets and models.This approach requires access to a substantial volume of detailed labor data.
Consumer preferences: Look at what consumers are willing to spend on protecting themselves. If possible, isolate the safety factors from other non-safety factors. Some people choose bicycle helmets (or choose to avoid them) on the basis of fashion or comfort. Unless the decision can be reduced to a purely cost-safety trade-off, the results can be skewed. Choosing a different behavior, such as purchase of home carbon monoxide detectors might allow other factors to be ignored as insignificant. Provided the retail cost of the product and its effectiveness in preventing fatal injuries are known, it can be associated with a value of life. Those who purchase it value their lives above that threshold, while those who don't value their lives below that threshold.

, Usually, this means doing a regression analysis, although its exact form will depend on the model used and the nature of the data observed.

, Similar measurements, like the value of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY), may be better suited for some purposes. The methods for measuring QALY are similar to those for measuring value of statistical life, but require also taking into account life expectancy and the probabilities of crippling, but non-fatal, injuries.

Generally speaking, outliers are data points that differ greatly from the trend expressed by the other values in the data set - in other words, they lie outside the other values. It's usually easy to detect this on data tables or (especially) on graphs. If the data set is expressed visually on the graph, outlying points will be ""far away"" from the other values. If, for instance, the majority of the points in a data set form a straight line, outlying values will not be able to be reasonably construed to conform to the line.


Let's consider a data set that represents the temperatures of 12 different objects in a room. If 11 of the objects have temperatures within a few degrees of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), but the twelfth object, an oven, has a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius), a cursory examination can tell you that the oven is a likely outlier..;
, The first step when calculating outliers in a data set is to find the median (middle) value of the data set. This task is greatly simplified if the values in the data set are arranged in order of least to greatest. So, before continuing, sort the values in your data set in this fashion.


Let's continue with the example above. Here is our data set representing the temperatures of several objects in a room: {71, 70, 73, 70, 70, 69, 70, 72, 71, 300, 71, 69}. If we order the values in the data set from lowest to highest, our new set of values is: {69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 71, 71, 71, 72, 73, 300}.

, The median of a data set is the data point above which half of the data sits and below which half of the data sits - essentially, it's the ""middle"" point in a data set. If the data set contains an odd number of points, this is easy to find - the median is the point which has the same number of points above as below it. However, if there are an even number of points, then, since there is no single middle point, the 2 middle points should be averaged to find the median. Note that, when calculating outliers, the median is usually assigned the variable Q2 - - this is because it lies between Q1 and Q3, the lower and upper quartiles, which we will define later.


Don't be confused by data sets with even numbers of points - the average of the two middle points will often be a number that doesn't appear in the data set itself - this is OK. However, if the two middle points are the same number, the average, obviously, will be this number as well, which is also OK.
In our example, we have 12 points. The middle 2 terms are points 6 and 7 - 70 and 71, respectively. So, the median for our data set is the average of these two points: ((70 + 71) / 2), = 70.5.

, This point, to which we will assign the variable Q1, is the data point below which 25 percent (or one quarter) of the observations set. In other words, this is the halfway point of the points in your data set below the median. If there are an even number of values below the median, you once again must average the two middle values to find Q1, much like you may have had to do to find the median itself.


In our example, 6 points lie above the median and 6 points lie below it. This means that, to find the lower quartile, we will need to average the two middle points of the bottom six points. Points 3 and 4 of the bottom 6 are both equal to 70. Thus, their average is ((70 + 70) / 2), = 70. 70 will be our value for Q1

, This point, which is assigned the variable Q3, is the data point above which 25 percent of the data sits. Finding Q3 is almost identical to finding Q1, except that, in this case, the points above the median, rather than below it, are taken into account.


Continuing with the example above, the two middle points of the 6 points above the median are 71 and 72. Averaging theses 2 points gives ((71 + 72) / 2), = 71.5. 71.5 will be our value for Q3.

, Now that we've defined Q1 and Q3, we need to calculate the distance between these two variables. The distance from Q1 to Q3 is found by subtracting Q1 from Q3. The value you obtain for the interquartile range is vital for determining the boundaries for non-outlier points in your data set.


In our example, our values for Q1 and Q3 are 70 and 71.5, respectively. To find the interquartile range, we subtract Q3 - Q1: 71.5 - 70 = 1.5.
Note that this works even if Q1, Q3, or both are negative numbers. For example, if our Q1 value was -70, our interquartile range would be 71.5 - (-70) = 141.5, which is correct.

, Outliers are identified by assessing whether or not they fall within a set of numerical boundaries called ""inner fences"" and ""outer fences"". A point that falls outside the data set's inner fences is classified as a minor outlier, while one that falls outside the outer fences is classified as a major outlier. To find the inner fences for your data set, first, multiply the interquartile range by 1.5. Then, add the result to Q3 and subtract it from Q1. The two resulting values are the boundaries of your data set's inner fences.


In our example, the interquartile range is (71.5 - 70), or 1.5. Multiplying this by 1.5 yields 2.25. We add this number to Q3 and subtract it from Q1 to find the boundaries of the inner fences as follows:

71.5 + 2.25 = 73.75
70 - 2.25 = 67.75
Thus, the boundaries of our inner fence are 67.75 and 73.75.


In our data set, only the temperature of the oven - 300 degrees - lies outside this range and thus may be a mild outlier. However, we still have yet to determine if this temperature is a major outlier, so let's not draw any conclusions until we do so.







, This is done in the same way as the inner fences, except that the interquartile range is multiplied by 3 instead of 1.5. The result is then added to Q3 and subtracted from Q1 to find the upper and lower boundaries of the outer fence.


In our example, multiplying the interquartile range above by 3 yields (1.5 * 3), or 4.5. We find the boundaries of the outer fence in the same fashion as before:

71.5 + 4.5 = 76
70 - 4.5 = 65.5
The boundaries of our outer fence are 65.5 and 76.


Any data points that lie outside the outer fences are considered major outliers. In this example, the oven temperature, 300 degrees, lies well outside the outer fences, so it's definitely a major outlier.







, Using the methodology described above, it's possible to determine whether certain points are minor outliers, major outliers, or not outliers at all. However, make no mistake - identifying a point as an outlier only marks it as a candidate for omission from the data set, not as a point that must be omitted. The reason that an outlier differs from the rest of the points in the data set is crucial in determining whether to omit the outlier or not. Generally, outliers that can be attributed to an error of some sort - an error in measurement, recording, or experimental design, for instance - are omitted. On the other hand, outliers that are not attributed to error and that reveal new information or trends that were not predicted are usually not omitted.


Another criterion to consider is whether outliers significantly impact the mean (average) of a data set in a way that skews it or makes it appear misleading. This is especially important to consider if you intend to draw conclusions from the mean of your data set.
Let's assess our example. In our example, since it's highly unlikely that the oven reached a temperature of 300 degrees through some unforeseen natural force, we can conclude with near-certainty that the oven was accidentally left on, resulting in the anomalous high temperature reading. Also, if we don't omit the outlier, the mean of our data set is (69 + 69 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 71 + 71 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 300)/12 = 89.67 degrees, while the mean if we do omit the outlier is (69 + 69 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 71 + 71 + 71 + 72 + 73)/11 = 70.55.

Since the outlier can be attributed to human error and because it's inaccurate to say that this room's average temperature was almost 90 degrees, we should opt to omit our outlier.



, While some outliers should be omitted from data sets because they result from error and/or skew results in ways that are inaccurate or misleading, some outliers should be kept. If, for example, an outlier appears to be genuinely obtained (that is, not the result of error) and/or gives some new insight into the phenomenon being measured, they should not be omitted out of hand. Scientific experiments are especially sensitive situations when dealing with outliers - omitting an outlier in error can mean omitting information that signifies some new trend or discovery.


For instance, let's say that we're designing a new drug to increase the size of fish in a fish farm. We'll use our old data set ({71, 70, 73, 70, 70, 69, 70, 72, 71, 300, 71, 69}), except, this time, each point will represent the mass of a fish (in grams) after being treated with a different experimental drug from birth. In other words, the first drug gave one fish a mass of 71 grams, the second drug gave a different fish a mass of 70 grams, and so on. In this situation, 300 is still a big outlier, but we shouldn't omit it because, assuming it's not due to an error, it represents a significant success in our experiment. The drug that yielded a 300 gram fish worked better than all the other drugs, so this point is actually the most important one in our data set, rather than the least.

Label the inflation rate according to the period of time you have calculated.",How to Calculate Inflation," Inflation is calculated by comparing prices of standard goods across time -- things like a loaf of white bread or a gallon of milk. This information is either given to you in your problem (""In 1962, the cost of milk was $1.00 a gallon..."") or you can look up the real-life prices on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).The more data you have, the better. If you're offered sample prices on your practice problem, you must average all of the prices and use this -- don't just choose one price to compare.

The CPI is calculated annually based on the average price of many goods, making it far more effective than a single good.;
, This is a breakdown, by month and year, of the changes in inflation based off of the averages mentioned above. Any time the CPI is higher than the current month, it means there has been inflation. If it is lower, then there has been deflation.

You can also go directly to the to download current inflation reports.

Inflation is calculated with the same formula in each country. Make sure you are using the same currency for all your numbers in the calculation.


, You can use months, years, or decades, as long as you clarify the period of time in your answer. Make sure you note the time frame you're measuring.Inflation must be over a timeframe -- there is no such thing as ""general inflation."" Remember, inflation tracks the worth of money: how much you need at one time to buy a good vs how much you need during another time. You must compare the price now to the price during some other time period to get inflation.


, Look up your first date on the CPI, or get the average of the good you're planning on calculating.
, Now, look up or calculate the data for the current price of the object. If you're doing historical research (for example, examining inflation before and after the Vietnam War), then it can help to get data from 2-3 different years, allowing you to account for any single-year spikes in inflation that could change the overall economic trends you're studying., This formula is simple. The ""top"" finds the difference in the CPI (rate of inflation), the bottom finds out what ratio of the total inflation that difference represents. Then you can multiply this answer by 100 to turn it into an easily-read percentage:


CurrentCPI−HistoricalCPICurrentCPI∗100{\displaystyle {\frac {CurrentCPI-HistoricalCPI}{CurrentCPI}}*100}, For example, imagine that we are calculating the inflation based on the price of bread between 2010 and 2012. For example, imagine the price of bread in 2012 is $3.67 and the price of bread in 2010 is $3.25.


$3.67−$3.25$3.67∗100{\displaystyle {\frac {\$3.67-\$3.25}{\$3.67}}*100}


, Solve for the difference in price, then divide it. Multiply the outcome by 100 to get a percentage.


$3.67−$3.25$3.67∗100{\displaystyle {\frac {\$3.67-\$3.25}{\$3.67}}*100}


$0.42$3.67∗100{\displaystyle {\frac {\$0.42}{\$3.67}}*100} 

Finally, Inflation=0.1144∗100{\displaystyle Inflation=0.1144*100}. 


The inflation rate is 11.4%


, If you're looking for perfect, real-world numbers, then go straight to the source. The calculator simply requires you to place in your amount, years to compare, and then spits out an inflation rate.
, This percentage means that, in current dollars, your money is worth about 12.9% less in today's dollars than they were in 2010. In other words, most products cost on average, 12.9% more than they did in 2010 (note -- this is an example, not actual data). If you had a negative number for your answer, you've been dealing with deflation, where a scarcity of cash makes your money more valuable, not less, over time. Use the formula just as you would with a positive figure., The inflation is useful only when assigned to the time period. Make sure any studies, news, or problems correctly account for the exact amount of time."

Obtain data that shows a change in a quantity over time.,

Express your decimal answer as a percentage.,
Organize your data in a table.,
Use a growth rate equation which takes into account the number of time intervals in your data.,
Isolate the ""growth rate"" variable.,
Solve for your growth rate.",How to Calculate Growth Rate," All you need to calculate a basic growth rate are two numbers - one that represents a certain quantity's starting value and another that represents is ending value. For instance, if your business was worth $1,000 at the beginning of the month and it's worth $1,200 today, you'll calculate growth rate with 1,000 as your starting (or ""past"") value and 1,200 as your ending (or ""present"") value. Let's do a simple example problem. In this case, we will use the two numbers 205 (as our past value) and 310 (as our present value).


If both values are the same, there is no growth - the growth rate is 0.

, Simply insert your past and present values into the following formula: (Present) - (Past) / (Past) . You'll get a fraction as an answer - divide this fraction to get a decimal value.


In our example, we'll insert 310 as our present value and 205 as our past value. Our formula will look like this: (310 - 205)/205 = 105/205 = 0.51


, Most growth rates are written as percents. To convert your decimal answer to a percentage, simply multiply it by 100, then add a percentage sign (""%""). Percentages are an easy-to-digest, universally-understood way to express change between two numbers.


So, for our example, we would multiply 0.51 by 100, then add a percent sign. 0.51 x 100 = 51%.

Our answer means our growth rate is 51%. In other words, our present value is 51% bigger than our past value. If our present value was smaller than our past value, our growth rate would be negative.


, This isn't absolutely necessary, but it's useful, as it allows you to visualize your given data as a range of values over a length of time. For our purposes, simple tables will usually suffice - simply use two columns, listing your values for time in the left column and the corresponding values for your quantity in the right column, as above.

, Your data should have regular values for time, each with a corresponding value for your quantity. The units for these time values aren't important - this method will work for data collected over spans of minutes, seconds, days, etc. In our case, our data is expressed in terms of years. Insert your past and present values into a new formula: (present) = (past) * (1 + growth rate)n where n = number of time periods.


This method will give us an average growth rate for each time interval given past and present figures and assuming a steady rate of growth. Because our example uses years, this means we'll get an average annual growth rate.

, Manipulate the equation via algebra to get ""growth rate"" by itself on one side of the equal sign. To do this, divide both sides by the past figure, take the exponent to 1/n, then subtract 1.


If your algebra works out, you should get: growth rate = (present / past)1/n - 1 .


, Insert values for your past and present values, as well as a value for n (which will be the number of time intervals in your data, including your past and present values.) Solve according to basic principles of algebra, order of operations, etc.


In our example, we'll use our present figure of 310 and our past figure of 205, along with a time period of 10 years for n. In this case, the average annual growth rate is simply (310/205)1/10 - 1 = .0422


0.0422 x 100 = 4.22%. On average, our value grew by 4.22 percent each year.

You need to begin by listing each event and each course of action that you could choose. For this first step, simply make two columns, headed “Events” and “Actions,” and write your options under each one.For example, suppose you are the head of a marketing department and you must choose between two advertising campaigns for a new product. One is a gradual introduction into the market and the other is a more extreme approach. These are your two “Actions,” which can be designated algebraically as A1 and A2. You do not know whether demand will be high or low. These represent the two “Events,” which can be designated algebraically as E1 and E2.;
, A payoff table is a grid that schematically illustrates your events and actions. Across the top row, labeled “Alternative Courses of Action,” write down the names of your two actions. In a column on the right, label it “Events” and list the events that could occur.For the marketing example, your top row will have two columns labeled “Gradual” and “Extreme.” The first column of your payoff table will have the heading “Events.” Under this heading, fill in the labels “High demand” and “Low demand.”
Because this particular payoff table had two events and two actions, there should be four blank spaces in the table. You will fill these with data as you proceed.

, You will need to make some assumptions or otherwise provide data for the calculations to come. These data will need to come from your knowledge of the field, from marketing research, or any other reliable sources that you use.For the marketing example, assume that research informs you that a gradual marketing campaign in a low demand market will generate a profit of $1 million, while an extreme marketing campaign in a low demand market will create a loss of $5 million. Additionally, you predict that if demand is high, a gradual campaign will create a profit of $4 million, while an extreme campaign in a high demand market will general a profit of $10 million. These assumptions or predictions represent the data that you will use to continue calculating the EOL.

, Notice that each of the four blank spaces in the table correspond to some combination of events and actions. Use your predicted or assumed values to complete the blank table.Given the marketing example, the upper left space represents a gradual campaign in a low demand market. Fill in this space with the corresponding value of 1 (you can count in millions for this problem). The second space on the top row represents an extreme campaign in a low demand, with a value of -5. The negative number represents a predicted financial loss. The bottom row should be filled in with 4 and 10, respectively. This completed grid is your payoff table for this problem.

, Once the data is complete in your payoff table, it should be easy to spot the most profitable course of action for each possible event. This is just a matter of selecting the highest number in each horizontal row.For example, in a low demand market, your two choices are represented by the values 1 or -5. Because 1 is the greater number, this represents the more valuable choice, which is the gradual marketing campaign.
In a high demand market, the extreme marketing campaign shows a higher value of 10, compared to 4 for the gradual campaign.

, This will be a new table that represents the value that you could lose from making any given choice. Set up a table with the same right hand column, representing the possible events. Make additional columns labeled “Optimum Action,” “Profit of Optimum Action,” and then one additional column for each of your alternative courses of action.Working with the marketing example, your headings will be “Optimum Action,” “Profit of Optimum Action,” “Gradual Campaign,” and “Extreme Campaign.” The first column on the right will list the two possible events, Low Demand and High Demand.

, Using the information from your payoff table, fill in the first few spaces of this opportunity loss table. In the Optimum Action column, the better choice for a low demand market is the Gradual campaign, so write in the word “Gradual.” On the second row, for a high demand market, the better choice is the extreme campaign, so fill in the word “Extreme.” These choices represent incomes of 1 and 10 million dollars, respectively, so enter those numbers in the Profit column., In the final columns, you will calculate the amount that you would expect to lose if you had chosen a less optimal course of action. In each space of the table, you will enter the value that corresponds to that action-event combination, subtracted from the optimal event in the previous column.For example, the first space represents the gradual campaign in the low demand market. This has a value of +1. It is also, you should recall, the optimal choice that you selected for this row. Therefore, the “loss” calculation is 1-1, which is 0. This makes sense because it is not really an alternative. It represents the choice that you made. Enter 0 in the first space.
The second space represents what you might have lost had you chosen an extreme marketing campaign in a low demand market. Calculate this by subtracting 1-(-5), for a value of +6.
Complete the rest of the table in similar fashion. The values in the last two columns should be:

0 6
6 0



, Notice that the values along the main diagonal are all 0. This makes sense because they are comparisons of each choice against itself, so there is no theoretical loss. However, compare the other values and you will see the amount of money that, based on your prediction data, you would lose under each scenario.For example, you made the initial decision that in a low demand market, a gradual campaign would be optimal. Had you chosen the extreme campaign, the table shows that you would expect to lose $6 million.
In a high demand market, your optimal choice is the extreme campaign. However, had you chosen the gradual campaign, you would expect to lose $6 million.

, From your company’s research predictions or other source of data, you will need to determine the relative probabilities for each event.For the marketing problem, assume for now that there is 40% chance of a low demand market. Since there are only two event options, this implies, therefore, that there is a 60% chance of a high demand market. You will use the probabilities of 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, in your final calculations.

, Referring to the Opportunity Loss table that you calculated above, multiply each of the predicted losses times the probability of that loss occurring.For example, the top row represents the low demand market, which has a probability of 0.4. Multiply each of the terms in this row by 0.4, to find the expected losses in a low demand market.
The second row represents the high demand market, with a probability of 0.6. Multiply each term in this row by 0.6, to calculated these expected losses.
The completed table should look like this:
(0)(.4)=0 (6)(.4)=2.4
(6)(.6)=3.6 (0)(.6)=0

, Each column represents the expected losses for each course of action you might choose, taking into account the probability of each event’s occurrence. When you add them together, you get the weighted total for each course of action.In this example, the first column is the gradual marketing campaign. Add the values 0+3.6 to get an expected loss of $3.6 million dollars if you choose that marketing campaign.
The second column represents the extreme marketing campaign. Total those figures to get 2.4+0=2.4. This suggests an expected loss of $2.4 million dollars from electing that advertising campaign.
Notice that these calculations are very simplistic, because this is a simple 2x2 model. In a real situation, you would have more options and more probabilities to consider. The sum total of the probabilities would be more meaningful.

, These results show the expected opportunity loss of choosing the “wrong” course of action under given circumstances. To optimize your profit, you would select the course of action that corresponds to the lowest EOL.In this marketing example, the better choice would be to go with the extreme marketing campaign, as the chance of a higher payoff is higher, and the lost opportunities from the gradual campaign alternative are reduced.

Example: Your data set lists the number of books each student has read in the last month. After sorting, this is the data set: 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8.;
, The frequency of a value is the number of times that value appears. (You can call this the ""absolute frequency"" when you need to avoid confusion with cumulative frequency.) The easiest way to keep track of it is to start a chart. Write ""Value"" (or a description of what the value measures) at the beginning of the first column. Write ""Frequency"" at the top of the second column. Fill out the chart for each value.



Example: Write ""Number of Books"" at the top of the first column. Write ""Frequency"" at the top of the second column.
In the second row, write the first value under Number of Books: 3.
Count the number of 3s in your data set. Since there are two 3s, write 2 underneath Frequency on the same row.
Repeat for each value until you have the full chart:

3  |  F = 2
5  |  F = 1
6  |  F = 3
8  |  F = 1



, The cumulative frequency answers the question ""how many times does this value or a smaller value show up?"" Always start with the lowest value in your data set. Since there are no smaller values, the answer is the same as that value's absolute frequency.



Example: Our lowest value is 3. The number of students who read 3 books is 2. No one read fewer than that, so the cumulative frequency is 3. Add it to the first row of your chart:

3  |  F = 2  |  CF=2



, Move to the next value on your chart. We just found how many times the lower values showed up. To find the cumulative frequency of this value, we just need to add its absolute frequency to the running total. In other words, take the last cumulative frequency you found, then add this value's absolute frequency.



Example:

3  |  F = 2  |  CF = 2

5  |  F = 1  |  CF = 2+1 = 3




, Keep moving to larger and larger values. Each time, add the last cumulative frequency to the next value's absolute frequency.



Example:

3  |  F = 2  |  CF = 2

5  |  F = 1  |  CF = 2 + 1 = 3

6  |  F = 3  |  CF = 3 + 3 = 6

8  |  F = 1  |  CF = 6 + 1 = 7




, Once you're done, you've added together the number of times every variable has appeared. The final cumulative frequency should equal the total number of data points in your set. There are two ways to check this:


Add all the individual frequencies together: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7, which is our final cumulative frequency.
Count the number of data points. Our list was 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8. There are 7 items, which is our final cumulative frequency.

, Discrete data comes in units you can count, where it's impossible to find part of a unit. Continuous data describes something uncountable, with measurements that could fall anywhere between whatever units you choose. Here are a couple examples:


Number of dogs: Discrete. There's no such thing as half a dog.
Depth of snow: Continuous. Snow gradually builds up, not in one unit at a time. If you tried to measure it in inches, you might find a snowdrifts that was 5.6 inches deep.

, Continuous data sets often have a large number of unique variables. If you tried to use the method above, your chart would be very long, and hard to understand. Instead, make each line of your chart a range of values. It's important to make each range the same size (such as 0—10, 11–20, 21–30, etc.), no matter how many values are in each range. Here's an example of a continuous data set turned into a chart:


Data set: 233, 259, 277, 278, 289, 301, 303
Chart (first column value, second column frequency, third column cumulative frequency):

200–250 | 1 | 1
251–300 | 4 | 1 + 4 = 5
301–350 | 2 | 5 + 2 = 7



, Once you've calculated cumulative frequency, get out some graph paper. Draw a line graph with the x-axis equal to the values of your data set, and the y-axis equal to the cumulative frequency. This will make the next calculations much easier.


For example, if your data set goes from 1 to 8, draw an x-axis with eight units marked on it. At each value on the x-axis, draw a point at the y-value that equals the cumulative frequency at that value. Connect each pair of adjacent points with a line.
If there are no data points at a particular value, the absolute frequency is 0. Adding 0 to the last cumulative frequency doesn't change its value, so draw a point at the same y-value as the last value.
Because cumulative frequency always increases along with the values, your line graph should always stay steady or go up as it moves to the right. If the line goes down at any point, you might be looking at absolute frequency by mistake.

, The median is the value exactly in the middle of the data set. Half of the values are above the median, and half are below. Here's how to find the median on your line graph:


Look at the last point on the far right of your graph. Its y-value is the total cumulative frequency, which is the number of points in the data set. Let's say this value is 16
Multiply this value by ½ and find it on the y-axis. In our example, half of 16 is 8. Find 8 on the y-axis.
Find the point on the line graph at this y-value. Move your finger from the 8 on the y-axis out across the graph. Stop when your finger touches the line of your graph. This is the point where exactly half of your data points have been counted.
Find the x-axis at this point. Move your finger straight down to see the x-axis value. This value is the median of your data set. For example, if this value is 65, then half of your data set is below 65, and half is above 65.

, Quartiles divide the data into four sections. This process is very similar to finding the median. The only difference is how you find the y-values:


To find the lower quartile's y-axis value, take the maximum cumulative frequency and multiply by ¼. The corresponding x-value tells you the value with exactly ¼ of the data below it.
To find the upper quartile's y-axis value, multiply the maximum cumulative frequency by ¾. The corresponding x-value tells you the value with exactly ¾ of the data below it and ¼ above it.

If necessary, simplify the numerator and denominator into single fractions.,
Flip the denominator to find its inverse.,
Multiply the numerator of the complex fraction by the inverse of the denominator.,
Simplify the new fraction by finding the greatest common factor.",How to Simplify Complex Fractions1," Complex fractions aren't necessarily difficult to solve. In fact, complex fractions in which the numerator and denominator both contain a single fraction are usually fairly easy to solve. So, if the numerator or denominator of your complex fraction (or both) contain multiple fractions or fractions and whole numbers, simplify as needed to obtain a single fraction in both the numerator and denominator. This may require finding the least common denominator (LCM) of two or more fractions.


For example, let's say we want to simplify the complex fraction (3/5 + 2/15)/(5/7 - 3/10). First, we would simplify both the numerator and denominator of our complex fraction to single fractions.

To simplify the numerator, we will use a LCM of 15 by multiplying 3/5 by 3/3. Our numerator becomes 9/15 + 2/15, which equals 11/15.
To simplify the denominator, we will use a LCM of 70 by multiplying 5/7 by 10/10 and 3/10 by 7/7. Our denominator becomes 50/70 - 21/70, which equals 29/70.
Thus, our new complex fraction is (11/15)/(29/70).

;
, By definition, dividing one number by another is the same as multiplying the first number by the inverse of the second. Now that we have obtained a complex fraction with a single fraction in both the numerator and the denominator, we can use this property of division to simplify our complex fraction! First, find the inverse of the fraction on the bottom of the complex fraction. Do this by ""flipping"" the fraction - setting its numerator in the place of the denominator and vice versa.


In our example, the fraction in the denominator of the complex fraction (11/15)/(29/70) is 29/70. To find its inverse, we simply ""flip"" it to get 70/29.

Note that, if your complex fraction has a whole number in its denominator, you can treat it as a fraction and find its inverse all the same. For instance, if our complex fraction was (11/15)/(29), we can define the denominator as 29/1, which makes its inverse 1/29.



, Now that you've obtained the inverse of your complex fraction's denominator, multiply it by the numerator to obtain a single simple fraction! Remember that to multiply two fractions, we simply multiply across - the numerator of the new fraction is the product of the numerators of the two old ones, and similarly with the denominator.


In our example, we would multiply 11/15 × 70/29. 70 × 11 = 770 and 15 × 29 = 435. So, our new simple fraction is 770/435.

, We now have a single, simple fraction, so all that remains is to render it in the simplest terms possible. Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by this number to simplify.


One common factor of 770 and 435 is 5. So, if we divide the numerator and denominator of our fraction by 5, we obtain 154/87. 154 and 87 don't have any common factors, so we know we've found our final answer!

When possible, use the inverse multiplication method above.,
If inverse multiplication is impractical, start by finding the lowest common denominator of the fractional terms in the complex fraction.,
Multiply the numerator of the complex fraction by the LCD you just found.,
Multiply the denominator of the complex fraction by the LCD as you did with the numerator.,
Form a new, simplified fraction from the numerator and denominator you just found.",How to Simplify Complex Fractions2," To be clear, virtually any complex fraction can be simplified by reducing its numerator and denominator to single fractions and multiplying the numerator by the inverse of the denominator. Complex fractions containing variables are no exception, though, the more complicated the variable expressions in the complex fraction are, the more difficult and time-consuming it is to use inverse multiplication. For ""easy"" complex fractions containing variables, inverse multiplication is a good choice, but complex fractions with multiple variable terms in the numerator and denominator may be easier to simplify with the alternate method described below.


For example, (1/x)/(x/6) is easy to simplify with inverse multiplication. 1/x × 6/x = 6/x2. Here, there is no need to use an alternate method.
However, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))) is more difficult to simplify with inverse multiplication. Reducing the numerator and denominator of this complex fraction to single fractions, inverse multiplying, and reducing the result to simplest terms is likely to be a complicated process. In this case, the alternate method below may be easier.

, The first step in this alternate method of simplification is to find the LCD of all the fractional terms in the complex fraction - both in its numerator and in its denominator. Usually, if one or more of the fractional terms have variables in their denominators, their LCD is just the product of their denominators.


This is easier to understand with an example. Let's try to simplify the complex fraction we mentioned above, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))). The fractional terms in this complex fraction are (1)/(x+3) and (1)/(x-5). The common denominator of these two fractions is the product of their denominators: (x+3)(x-5).

, Next, we'll need to multiply the terms in our complex fraction by the LCD of its fractional terms. In other words, we'll multiply the entire complex fraction by (LCD)/(LCD). We can do this freely because (LCD)/(LCD) is equal to 1. First, multiply the numerator on its own.


In our example, we would multiply our complex fraction, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))), by ((x+3)(x-5))/((x+3)(x-5)). We'll have to multiply through the numerator and denominator of the complex fraction, multiplying each term by (x+3)(x-5).

First, let's multiply the numerator: (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10) × (x+3)(x-5)

= (((x+3)(x-5)/(x+3)) + x((x+3)(x-5)) - 10((x+3)(x-5))
= (x-5) + (x(x2 - 2x - 15)) - (10(x2 - 2x - 15))
= (x-5) + (x3 - 2x2 - 15x) - (10x2 - 20x - 150)
= (x-5) + x3 - 12x2 + 5x + 150
= x3 - 12x2 + 6x + 145






, Continue multiplying the complex fraction by the LCD you found by proceeding to the denominator. Multiply through, multiplying every term by the LCD.


The denominator of our complex fraction, (((1)/(x+3)) + x - 10)/(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))), is x +4 +((1)/(x-5)). We'll multiply this by the LCD we found, (x+3)(x-5).

(x +4 +((1)/(x - 5))) × (x+3)(x-5)
= x((x+3)(x-5)) + 4((x+3)(x-5)) + (1/(x-5))(x+3)(x-5).
= x(x2 - 2x - 15) + 4(x2 - 2x - 15) + ((x+3)(x-5))/(x-5)
= x3 - 2x2 - 15x + 4x2 - 8x - 60 + (x+3)
= x3 + 2x2 - 23x - 60 + (x+3)
= x3 + 2x2 - 22x - 57




, After multiplying your fraction by your (LCD)/(LCD) expression and simplifying by combining like terms, you should be left with a simple fraction containing no fractional terms. As you may have noticed, by multiplying through by the LCD of the fractional terms in the original complex fraction, the denominators of these fractions cancel out, leaving variable terms and whole numbers in the numerator and denominator of your answer, but no fractions.


Using the numerator and denominator we found above, we can construct a fraction that's equal to our initial complex fraction but which contains no fractional terms. The numerator we obtained was x3 - 12x2 + 6x + 145 and the denominator was x3 + 2x2 - 22x - 57, so our new fraction is (x3 - 12x2 + 6x + 145)/(x3 + 2x2 - 22x - 57)

List the factors of the numerator and denominator.,
Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.,
Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF.,
Check your work.",How to Reduce Fractions1," Factors are numbers that you multiply together to get another number. For example, 3 and 4 are both factors of 12, because you can multiply them together to get 12. To list the factors of a number, you simply have to list all of the numbers that can be multiplied to get that number, and which therefore can be evenly divided into that number.


List the factors of that number from smallest to largest, not forgetting to include 1 or that number. For example, this is how you would list the factors of the numerator and denominator of the fraction, 24/32:
24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.
32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

;
, The GCF is the highest number that divides evenly into two or more numbers. Once you've listed all of the factors of that number, all you have to do is find the largest number that is repeated in both lists.


24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.
32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.
The GCF of 24 and 32 is 8, because 8 is the largest number that evenly divides into both 24 and 32.


, Now that you've found your GCF, all you have to do is to divide the numerator and denominator by that number to reduce your fraction to its lowest terms. Here's how to do it:


24/8 = 3
32/8 = 4
The simplified fraction is 3/4.

, If you'd like to make sure that you've simplified the fraction correctly, you can simply multiply the new numerator and new denominator by the GCF to make sure that you can return to the original fraction. Here's how to do it:


3 * 8 = 24
4 * 8 = 32
You have returned to the original fraction, 24/32.

You can also examine the fraction to make sure that it cannot be reduced any more. Since 3 is a prime number, it can only be divisible by 1 and itself, and four is not divisible by 3, so the fraction cannot be reduced further.

Pick a small number.,
Divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by that number.,
Repeat.,
Keep dividing by that number until you can't go any further.,
Make sure the fraction cannot be reduced further.,
Check your work.",How to Reduce Fractions2," Using this method, you simply have to choose a small number, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7, to get started. Look at the fractions to make sure that each one is divisible by the number you choose at least once. For example, if you're looking at the fraction 24/108, don't pick the number 5, because it won't go into either number. However, if you're looking at the fraction 25/60, 5 will be a great number to use.


For the fraction 24/32, the number 2 works well. Since both numbers are even, they will be divisible by 2.

, The new fraction will be comprised of the new numerator and denominator you get after dividing the top and bottom of the fraction 24/32 by 2. Here's how to do it:


24/2 = 12
32/2 = 16
Your new fraction is 12/16.


, Continue this process. Since both numbers are still even, you can keep dividing them by 2. If just one or both of your new numerators and denominators are odd, then you can try to divide them by a new number. Here's how the process will work if you're sticking with the fraction 12/16:


12/2 = 6
16/2 = 8
Your new fraction is 6/8.


, Both the new numerator and the new denominator are still even, so you can keep dividing them by 2. Here's how to do it:


6/2 = 3
8/2 = 4
Your new fraction is 3/4.


, In the fraction 3/4, 3 is a prime number, so its only factors are 1 and itself, and 4 is not divisible by three, so the fraction has been simplified as much as possible. If the numerator or denominator of the fraction can no longer be divisible by the number you've chosen, you may still be able to divide it by using a new number.


For example, if you have the fraction 10/40, and are dividing the numerator and denominator by 5, you will be left with 2/8. You cannot keep dividing the numerator and denominator by 5, but you can divide both by 2 to get the final answer of 1/4.

, Work backwards to multiply 3/4 by 2/2 three times, to make sure that you get the original answer of 24/32. Here's how you do it:


3/4 * 2/2 = 6/8
6/8 * 2/2 = 12/16
12/16 * 2/2 = 24/32.
Note that you've divided 24/32 by 2 * 2 * 2, which is the same as dividing it by 8, the greatest common factor (GCF) of 24 and 32.

, Keep them in separate lists. It may be easiest if the lists line up on top of each other. Start with 1 and work your way up, listing them in pairs.

For example, if your fraction is 24/60, start off with 24.
You'd write: 24 -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24






Then, move onto 60.
You'd write: 60 -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60







, This may be referred to as the GCF in your textbook. What's the biggest number that goes into both the numerator and the denominator? Whatever it is, divide both numbers by that.


For our example, the biggest number that is a factor of both numbers is 12. Therefore, we divide 24 by 12 and 60 by 12, leaving us with 2/5 -- our reduced fraction!

Start with the numerator. From 24, branch off into 2 and 12. Since 2 is a prime number already, you're done with that branch! Then take 12 into two more numbers: 2 and 6. 2 is a prime number -- great! Now divide 6 into two numbers: 2 and 3. You now have 2, 2, 2, and 3 as your prime numbers.






Move onto the denominator. From 60, branch off your tree to 2 and 30. 30 will then split into 2 and 15. Then split 15 into 3 and 5,both prime. You now have 2, 2, 3 and 5 as your prime numbers.







, Take the list of prime numbers you have for each number and write them out to be multiplied. You don't actually have to do the math -- this just makes it easier to see.


So, for 24, you have 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 24.
For 60, you have 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 = 60

, Any numbers that you see that are part of both numbers can be eliminated. In this case, what we have in common is a pair of twos and a 3. Goodbye!


What we are left with is 2 and 5 -- or 2/5! The same answer we got with the above method.

Know the vocabulary for algebraic fractions.,
Review how to solve simple fractions.,
Remove factors from algebraic expressions just like normal numbers.,
Know you can remove complex terms just like simple ones.",How to Simplify Algebraic Fractions1," The following terms will be used throughout the examples, and are common in problems involving algebraic fractions:



Numerator: The top part of a fraction (ie. ‘’’(x+5)’’’/(2x+3)).

Denominator: The bottom part of the fraction (ie. (x+5)/’’’(2x+3)’’’).

Common Denominator: This is a number that you can divide out of both the top and bottom of a fraction. For example, in the fraction 3/9, the common denominator is 3, since both numbers can be divided by 3.

Factor: One number that multiples to make another. For example, the factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.

Simplified Equation: This involves removing all common factors and grouping similar variables together (5x + x = 6x) until you have the most basic form of a fraction, equation, or problem. If you cannot do anything more to the fraction, it is simplified.;
, These are the exact same steps you will take to solve algebraic fractions. Take the example, 15/35. In order to simplify a fraction, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, both numbers can be divided by five, so you can remove the 5 from the fraction:
15 → 5 * 3
35 → 5 * 7

Now you can cross out like terms. In this case you can cross out the two fives, leaving your simplified answer, 3/7.

, In the previous example, you could easily remove the 5 from 15, and the same principle applies to more complex expressions like, 15x – 5. Find a factor that both numbers have in common. Here, the answer is 5, since you can divide both 15x and -5 by the number five. Like before, remove the common factor and multiply it by what is “left.”15x – 5 = 5 * (3x – 5)

To check your work, simply multiply the five back into the new expression – you will end up with the same numbers you started with.

, The same principle used in common fractions works for algebraic ones as well. This is the easiest way to simplify fractions while you work. Take the fraction:
(x+2)(x-3)
(x+2)(x+10)

Notice how the term (x+2) is common in both the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom). As such, you can remove it to simplify the algebraic fraction, just like you removed the 5 from 15/35:
(x+2)(x-3) → (x-3)(x+2)(x+10) → (x+10)

This leaves us with our final answer: (x-3)/(x+10)

Find a common factor in the denominator.,
Remove like terms.,
Know when the equation is fully simplified.,
Try a practice problem.",How to Simplify Algebraic Fractions2," The first thing to do when simplifying an algebraic fraction is to simplify each part of the fraction. Start with the top part, factoring out as many numbers as you can. For an example, this section will use the problem:
9x-3
15x+6

Start with the numerator: 9x – 3. There is a common factor to both 9x and -3: 3. Factor out the 3 like you would any other number, leaving you with 3 * (3x-1). This is your new numerator:
3(3x-1)
15x+6

, Continuing the example from above, isolate the denominator, 15x+6. Again, look for a number that can divide into both parts. Here you can again factor out a 3, leaving you with 3 * (5x +2). Write in your new denominator:
3(3x-1)
3(5x+2)

, This is the stage where you really get to simplify the fraction. Take any terms that are in both the numerator and the denominator and remove them. In this case, we can remove the 3 from both the top and the bottom.
3(3x-1) → (3x-1)3(5x+2) → (5x+2)

, A fraction is simplified when there are no more common factors in the top or the bottom. Remember that you cannot remove factors from inside the parenthesis – in the example problem you cannot factor out the x from 3x and 5x, since the full terms are actually (3x -1) and (5x + 2). Thus, the example is fully simplified, making the final answer:
(3x-1)
(5x+2)

, The best way to learn is to keep trying to simplify algebraic fractions. The answers are underneath the problems.

”Reverse” parts of the fraction by factoring out negative numbers.,

Simplify any polynomial expressions.,
Remember that variables can be factored out as well.",How to Simplify Algebraic Fractions3," For example, let’s say we have the equation:
3(x-4)
5(4-x)

Notice how (x-4) and (4-x) are ‘’almost’’ identical, but you can’t cross them out because they are reversed. However, (x - 4) can be written as -1 * (4 - x) in the same way that you rewrite (4 + 2x) as 2 * (2 + x). This is called “factoring out the negative.”
-1 * 3(4-x)
5(4-x)

Now we can easily remove the two identical (4-x):
-1 * 3(4-x)
5(4-x)


Leaving us with our final answer -3/5

, The difference of two squares is simply one squared number subtracted by another, like the expression (a2 - b2). The difference of perfect squares always simplifies into two parts, adding and subtracting the square roots. In every case, you can simplify the difference of perfect square as follows:a2 - b2 = (a+b)(a-b)

This can be incredibly helpful when trying to find like terms in algebraic fractions.


Example: x2 - 25 = (x+5)(x-5)

, Polynomials are complex algebraic expressions with more than two terms, like x2 + 4x + 3. Luckily, many polynomials can be simplified using polynomial factorization. The previous expression, for example, can be rewritten as (x+3)(x+1).

, This is especially helpful in expressions with exponents, like x4 + x2. You can remove the largest exponent as a factor. In this case, x4 + x2 = x2(x2 + 1).

;
, The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. It tells you how many equal pieces a whole is divided into.

For example, in the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, 4 is the denominator, and it tells you that a whole is divided into four equal parts, or quarters.


, The numerator is the number above the fraction bar. It tells you how many pieces you have.

For example, in the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, 10 is the numerator, and it tells you that you have 10 parts, or 10 quarters.


, Divide each whole according to the denominator of your fraction.

For example, if your denominator is 4, then divide each circle you draw into 4 equal pieces, or quarters.


, The number in the numerator tells you how many pieces you should shade in.

For example, if your fraction is 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, you will shade in 10 quarters.


, To simplify an improper fraction, you must turn it into a mixed number, which includes a whole number and a fraction together. The number of whole circles you shaded in represents the whole number of your mixed fraction. Write this number down.

For example, for the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, you should have shaded in 2 whole circles, so the whole number of your mixed number will be 2.


, The leftover shaded parts will represent the fraction in your mixed number. Write this fraction next to your whole number, and you have your mixed number.

For the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}}, you should have shaded in 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} of a circle, so the fraction part of your mixed number will be 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}. So 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} is equal to 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}.


, Sometimes the fraction of your mixed number will need to be reduced before you reach your final, simplified answer.For example, if your mixed number is 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}, you could simplify it to 212{\displaystyle 2{\frac {1}{2}}}

, Remember that the fraction bar can be interpreted as a division symbol.To simplify an improper fraction, you must turn it into a mixed number, which includes a whole number and a fraction together. The number of times you can divide the numerator evenly by the denominator will be the whole number of your mixed number. Write this number down, and note the remainder.

The denominator will not divide evenly into the numerator. The remainder will be interpreted as the fraction part of your mixed number.

For example, for the fraction 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} complete the calculation 10÷4=2R2{\displaystyle 10\div 4=2R2}. So the whole number of your fraction will be 2{\displaystyle 2}.


, To do this, take the remainder, and place it over the denominator of the original improper fraction. Combine this new fraction with the whole number, and you have your mixed number.

For example, 10÷4=2R2{\displaystyle 10\div 4=2R2}, so the fraction would be 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}}. So 104{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{4}}} is equal to 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}.


, Sometimes the fraction of your mixed number will need to be reduced before you reach your final, simplified answer.For example, if your mixed number is 224{\displaystyle 2{\frac {2}{4}}}, you could simplify it to 212{\displaystyle 2{\frac {1}{2}}}.

7327⋅77{\displaystyle {\frac {7{\sqrt {3}}}{2{\sqrt {7}}}}\cdot {\frac {\sqrt {7}}{\sqrt {7}}}}


, The fraction has now been rationalized.


7327⋅77=72114=212{\displaystyle {\frac {7{\sqrt {3}}}{2{\sqrt {7}}}}\cdot {\frac {\sqrt {7}}{\sqrt {7}}}={\frac {7{\sqrt {21}}}{14}}={\frac {\sqrt {21}}{2}}}


, If your fraction contains a sum of two terms in the denominator, at least one of which is irrational, then you cannot multiply the fraction by it in the numerator and denominator.


42+2{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{2+{\sqrt {2}}}}}

To see why this is the case, write an arbitrary fraction 1a+b,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{a+b}},} where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are irrational. Then the expression (a+b)(a+b)=a2+2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a+b)(a+b)=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}} contains a cross-term 2ab.{\displaystyle 2ab.} If at least one of a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} is irrational, then the cross-term will contain a radical.

Let's see how this works with our example.


42+2⋅2+22+2=4(2+2)4+42+2{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{2+{\sqrt {2}}}}\cdot {\frac {2+{\sqrt {2}}}{2+{\sqrt {2}}}}={\frac {4(2+{\sqrt {2}})}{4+4{\sqrt {2}}+2}}}



As you can see, there's no way we can get rid of the 42{\displaystyle 4{\sqrt {2}}} in the denominator after doing this.


, The conjugate of an expression is the same expression with the sign reversed. For example, the conjugate of 2+2{\displaystyle 2+{\sqrt {2}}} is 2−2.{\displaystyle 2-{\sqrt {2}}.}


42+2⋅2−22−2{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{2+{\sqrt {2}}}}\cdot {\frac {2-{\sqrt {2}}}{2-{\sqrt {2}}}}}

Why does the conjugate work? Going back to our arbitrary fraction 1a+b,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{a+b}},} multiplying by the conjugate in the numerator and denominator results in the denominator being (a+b)(a−b)=a2−b2.{\displaystyle (a+b)(a-b)=a^{2}-b^{2}.} The key here is that there are no cross-terms. Since both of these terms are being squared, any square roots will be eliminated.


,


42+2⋅2−22−2=4(2−2)4−2=4−22{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{2+{\sqrt {2}}}}\cdot {\frac {2-{\sqrt {2}}}{2-{\sqrt {2}}}}={\frac {4(2-{\sqrt {2}})}{4-2}}=4-2{\sqrt {2}}}


, If you are asked to write the reciprocal of a set of terms containing a radical, you will need to rationalize before simplifying. Use the method for monomial or binomial denominators, depending on whichever applies to the problem.


2−3{\displaystyle 2-{\sqrt {3}}}


, A reciprocal is created when you invert the fraction. Our expression 2−3{\displaystyle 2-{\sqrt {3}}} is actually a fraction. It's just being divided by 1.


12−3{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2-{\sqrt {3}}}}}


, Remember, you're actually multiplying by 1, so you have to multiply both the numerator and denominator. Our example is a binomial, so multiply the top and bottom by the conjugate.


12−3⋅2+32+3{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2-{\sqrt {3}}}}\cdot {\frac {2+{\sqrt {3}}}{2+{\sqrt {3}}}}}


,


12−3⋅2+32+3=2+34−3=2+3{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2-{\sqrt {3}}}}\cdot {\frac {2+{\sqrt {3}}}{2+{\sqrt {3}}}}={\frac {2+{\sqrt {3}}}{4-3}}=2+{\sqrt {3}}}

Do not be thrown off by the fact that the reciprocal is the conjugate. This is just a coincidence. 


, You can also expect to face cube roots in the denominator at some point, though they are rarer. This method also generalizes to roots of any index.


333{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{\sqrt{3}}}}


, Finding an expression that will rationalize the denominator here will be a bit different because we cannot simply multiply by the radical.


331/3{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{3^{1/3}}}}


, In our case, we are dealing with a cube root, so multiply by 32/332/3.{\displaystyle {\frac {3^{2/3}}{3^{2/3}}}.} Remember that exponents turn a multiplication problem into an addition problem by the property abac=ab+c.{\displaystyle a^{b}a^{c}=a^{b+c}.}


331/3⋅32/332/3{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{3^{1/3}}}\cdot {\frac {3^{2/3}}{3^{2/3}}}} 

This can generalize to nth roots in the denominator. If we have 1a1/n,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{a^{1/n}}},} we multiply the top and bottom by a1−1n.{\displaystyle a^{1-{\frac {1}{n}}}.} This will make the exponent in the denominator 1.


,


331/3⋅32/332/3=32/3{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{3^{1/3}}}\cdot {\frac {3^{2/3}}{3^{2/3}}}=3^{2/3}}

If you need to write it in radical form, factor out the 1/3.{\displaystyle 1/3.}


32/3=(32)1/3=93{\displaystyle 3^{2/3}=(3^{2})^{1/3}={\sqrt{9}}}

Find a common denominator for all the fractions.,
Convert each fraction so it uses the common denominator.,
Use the top number to order the fractions.,
Return each fraction to its original form.",How to Order Fractions From Least to Greatest1," Use one of these methods to find a denominator, or lower number of a fraction, that you can use to rewrite every fraction in the list, so you can easily compare them. This is called a common denominator, or the lowest common denominator if it is the lowest one possible:Multiply every different denominator together. For example, if you are comparing 2/3, 5/6, and 1/3, multiply the two different denominators: 3 x 6 = 18. This is a simple method, but will often result in a much larger number than the other methods, which can be difficult to work with.

Or list the multiples of each denominator in a separate column, until you notice a number that shows up on every column. Use this number. For example, comparing 2/3, 5/6, and 1/3, list a few multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. Then list the multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18. Since 18 shows up on both lists, use that number. (You could also use 12, but the examples below will assume you are using 18.);
, Remember, if you multiply a fraction's top and bottom by the same amount, the fraction is still the same size. Use this technique on each fraction, one by one, so that each one uses the common denominator as the bottom number. Try it for 2/3, 5/6, and 1/3, using the common denominator 18:


18 ÷ 3 = 6, so 2/3 = (2x6)/(3x6)=12/18
18 ÷ 6 = 3, so 5/6 = (5x3)/(6x3)=15/18
18 ÷ 3 = 6, so 1/3 = (1x6)/(3x6)=6/18

, Now that they all have the same denominator, the fractions are easy to compare. Use their top number, or numerator, to rank them from least to greatest. Ranking the fractions we found above, we get: 6/18, 12/18, 15/18.

, Keep the fractions in the same order, but return each one back to its original form. You can do this by remembering how each fraction transformed, or by dividing the top and bottom of each fraction again:


6/18 = (6 ÷ 6)/(18 ÷ 6) = 1/3
12/18 = (12 ÷ 6)/(18 ÷ 6) = 2/3
15/18 = (15 ÷ 3)/(18 ÷ 3) = 5/6
The answer is ""1/3, 2/3, 5/6""

Write the two fractions next to each other.,
Multiply the top of the first fraction with the bottom of the second fraction.,
Write your answer next to the first fraction.,
Multiply the top of the second fraction with the bottom of the first.,
Write this answer next to the second fraction.,
Compare the values of the two cross-products.,
Understand why this works.",How to Order Fractions From Least to Greatest2," For example, compare the fraction 3/5 and the fraction 2/3. Write these next to each other on the page: 3/5 on the left, and 2/3 on the right.

, In our example, the top number, or numerator, of the first fraction (3/5) is 3. The bottom number, or denominator, of the second fraction (2/3) is also 3. Multiply these together: 3 x 3 = ?


This method is called cross-multiplication, because you multiply numbers in a diagonal line across from each other.

, Write the product, or answer to your multiplication problem, next to the first fraction on the page. In our example, 3 x 3 = 9, so you would write 9 next to the first fraction, on the left side of the page.

, To find out which fraction is larger, we'll need to compare our answer above with the answer to another multiplication problem. Multiply these two numbers together. For our example (comparing 3/5 and 2/3), multiply 2 x 5 together.

, Write the answer to this second multiplication problem next to the second fraction. In this example, the answer is 10.

, The answers to the multiplication problems in this method are called cross-products. If one cross-product is larger than the other, then the fraction next to that cross-product is also larger than the other fraction. In our example, because 9 is less than 10, this means 3/5 must be less than 2/3.


Remember, always write the cross-product next to the fraction whose top number you used.

, To compare two fractions, typically you transform them to give them the same denominator, or lower part of the fraction. Secretly, this is what cross-multiplication does!It just skips over actually writing the denominators, since once the two fractions have the same one, you only need to compare the top two numbers. Here's our same example (3/5 vs 2/3), written without the cross-multiplying ""shortcut"":


3/5=(3x3)/(5x3)=9/15
2/3=(2x5)/(3x5)=10/15
9/15 is less than 10/15
Therefore, 3/5 is less than 2/3

Use this for fractions with a top number equal or larger than the bottom number.,
Convert each improper fraction into a mixed number.,
Sort the mixed numbers by whole number.,
If necessary, compare the fractions in each group.,
Use your results to sort your whole list of mixed numbers.,
Convert the mixed numbers back to their original fractions.",How to Order Fractions From Least to Greatest3," If a fraction has a top number, or numerator, that is larger than the bottom number, or denominator, it is larger than one. 8/3 is one example of this type of fraction. You can also use this for fractions with an equal numerator and denominator, such as 9/9. Both of these fractions are examples of improper fractions.You can still use the other methods for these fractions. This method helps these fractions make sense, however, and might be faster.

, Turn them into a mix of whole numbers and fractions. Sometimes, you might be able to do this in your head. For example, 9/9 = 1. Other times, use long division to find out how many times the numerator goes evenly into the denominator. The remainder in that long division problem, if any, gets ""left over"" as a fraction. For instance:


8/3 = 2 + 2/3
9/9 = 1
19/4 = 4 + 3/4
13/6 = 2 + 1/6

, Now that there are no improper fractions, you have a better idea of how large each number is. Ignore the fractions for now, and sort the fractions into groups by whole number:


1 is the smallest
2 + 2/3 and 2 + 1/6 (we don't yet know which is larger than the other)
4 + 3/4 is the largest

, If you have multiple mixed numbers with the same whole number, such as 2 + 2/3 and 2 + 1/6, compare the fraction part of the number to see which is larger. You can use any of the methods in the other sections to do this. Here's an example comparing 2 + 2/3 and 2 + 1/6, converting the fractions to the same denominator:


2/3 = (2x2)/(3x2) = 4/6
1/6 = 1/6
4/6 is greater than 1/6
2 + 4/6 is greater than 2 + 1/6
2 + 2/3 is greater than 2 + 1/6

, Once you've sorted the fractions in each group of mixed numbers, you can sort your entire list: 1, 2 + 1/6, 2 + 2/3, 4 + 3/4.

, Keep the order the same, but undo the changes you made and write the numbers as the original improper fractions: 9/9, 8/3, 13/6, 19/4.

"
List the multiples of each denominator.,
Identify the lowest common multiple.,
Rewrite the original equation.,
Solve the rewritten problem.",How to Find the Least Common Denominator1," Make a list of several multiples for each denominator in the equation. Each list should consist of the denominator numeral multiplied by 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.


Example: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5

Multiples of 2: 2 * 1 = 2; 2 * 2 = 4; 2 * 3 = 6; 2 * 4 = 8; 2 * 5 = 10; 2 * 6 = 12; 2 * 7 = 14; etc.

Multiples of 3: 3 * 1 = 3; 3 * 2 = 6; 3 *3 = 9; 3 * 4 = 12; 3 * 5 = 15; 3 * 6 = 18; 3 * 7 = 21; etc.

Multiples of 5: 5 * 1 = 5; 5 * 2 = 10; 5 * 3 = 15; 5 * 4 = 20; 5 * 5 = 25; 5 * 6 = 30; 5 * 7 = 35; etc.;
, Scan through each list and mark any multiples that are shared by all of the original denominators. After identifying the common multiples, identify the lowest denominator.


Note that if no common denominator exists at this point, you may need to continue writing out multiples until you eventually come across a shared multiple.
This method is easier to use when small numbers are present in the denominator.
In this example, the denominators only share one multiple and it is 30: 2 * 15 = 30; 3 * 10 = 30; 5 * 6 = 30

The LCD = 30

, In order to change each fraction in the equation so that it remains true to the original equation, you will need to multiply each numerator (the top of the fraction) and denominator by the same factor used to multiply the corresponding denominator when reaching the LCD.


Example: (15/15) * (1/2); (10/10) * (1/3); (6/6) * (1/5)
New equation: 15/30 + 10/30 + 6/30

, After finding the LCD and changing the fractions accordingly, you should be able to solve the problem without further difficulty. Remember to simplify the fraction at the end.


Example: 15/30 + 10/30 + 6/30 = 31/30 = 1 1/30

List all of the factors of each denominator.,
Identify the greatest common factor between both denominators.,
Multiply the denominators together.,
Divide this product by the GCF.,
Divide the LCD by the original denominator.,
Solve the rewritten equation.",How to Find the Least Common Denominator2," The factors of a number are all of the whole numbers that are evenly divisible into that one number.The number 6 has four factors: 6, 3, 2, and 1. Every number has a factor of 1 because every number can be multiplied by one.


For example: 3/8 + 5/12.
Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, and 8
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

, Once you have listed the factors of each denominator, circle all of the common factors. The largest of the common factors is the greatest common factor (GCF) that will be used to continue solving the problem.


In our example, 8 and 12 share the factors 1, 2, and 4.
The greatest common factor is 4.

, In order to use the greatest common factor to solve the problem, you must first multiply the two denominators together.


Continuing our example: 8 * 12 = 96

, After finding the product of the two denominators, divide that product by the GCF you found previously. This number will be your least common denominator (LCD).


Example: 96 / 4 = 24

, To determine the multiple needed to make the denominators equal, divide the LCD you determined by the original denominator. Multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by this number. The denominators should now both be equal to the LCD.


Example: 24 / 8 = 3; 24 / 12 = 2
(3/3) * (3/8) = 9/24; (2/2) * (5/12) = 10/24
9/24 + 10/24

, With the LCD found, you should be able to add and subtract the fractions in the equation without further difficulty. Remember to simplify the fraction at the end, if possible.


Example: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24

Prime factorization of 4: 2 * 2

Prime factorization of 5: 5

Prime factorization of 12: 2 * 2 * 3

, Tally up the number of times that each prime number appears in the factorization of each denominator digit.


Example: There are two 2’s in 4; zero 2’s in 5; two 2’s in 12
There are zero 3’s in 4 and 5; one 3 in 12
There are zero 5’s in 4 and 12; one 5 in 5

, Identify the largest number of times you used each prime number for any of the denominators and note that count.


Example: The largest count of 2 is two; the largest of 3 is one; the largest of 5 is one

, Do not write out the number of times each prime number appeared throughout all the original denominators. Only write out the largest count, as determined in the previous step.


Example: 2, 2, 3, 5

, Multiply the prime numbers together as they appeared in the previous step. The product of these numbers equals the LCD for the original equation.


Example: 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 60
LCD = 60


, To determine the multiple needed to make the denominators equal, divide the LCD you determined by the original denominator. Multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by this number. The denominators should now both be equal to the LCD.


Example: 60/4 = 15; 60/5 = 12; 60/12 = 5
15 * (1/4) = 15/60; 12 * (1/5) = 12/60; 5 * (1/12) = 5/60
15/60 + 12/60 + 5/60

, With the LCD found, you should be able to add and subtract the fractions as usual. Remember to simplify the fraction at the end, if possible.


Example: 15/60 + 12/60 + 5/60 = 32/60 = 8/15

Example: 8 + 2 1/4 + 2/3
8 = 8/1
2 1/4; 2 * 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9; 9/4

Rewritten equation: 8/1 + 9/4 + 2/3

, Implement any of the methods used for finding the LCD of common fractions, as explained in the previous method sections. Note that for this example, we will be using the “listing multiples” method, in which a list of multiples is created for each denominator and the LCD is identified from these lists.


Note that you do not need to create a list of multiples for 1 since any number multiplied by 1 equals itself; in other words, every number is a multiple of 1.
Example: 4 * 1 = 4; 4 * 2 = 8; 4 * 3 = 12; 4 * 4 = 16; etc.
3 * 1 = 3; 3 * 2 = 6; 3 * 3 = 9; 3 * 4 = 12; etc.
The LCD = 12


, Instead of multiplying the denominator alone, you must multiply the entire fraction by the digit required for changing the original denominator into the LCD.


Example: (12/12) * (8/1) = 96/12; (3/3) * (9/4) = 27/12; (4/4) * (2/3) = 8/12
96/12 + 27/12 + 8/12

, With the LCD determined and the original equation changed to reflect the LCD, you should be able to add and subtract without difficulty. Remember to simplify the fraction at the end, if possible.


Example: 96/12 + 27/12 + 8/12 = 131/12 = 10 11/12

The whole number represents how many complete wholes you have. The fraction represents how many parts of a whole you have. The denominator is an indication of how many parts a whole something can be broken into. By multiplying the whole number by the denominator, you can determine how many pieces exist among wholes.

For example, if you need to convert 51416{\displaystyle 5{\frac {14}{16}}}, you would first calculate 5×16=80{\displaystyle 5\times 16=80}.
;
, These are all the extra pieces that do not make a whole. Make sure you add this number to the product of the whole number and the denominator. This number will become the new numerator of your improper fraction.

For example, 80+14=94{\displaystyle 80+14=94}. So, the new numerator of your improper fraction is 94.


, You do not need to make any changes to the denominator to create your improper fraction.For example, since the original denominator of the proper fraction was 16, the denominator of your improper fraction is also 16. So, 51416=9416{\displaystyle 5{\frac {14}{16}}={\frac {94}{16}}}.


, A factor will be any number that evenly divides into the numerator. If you need help finding all of the factors, you can make a  factor tree.

For example, the factors of 94 are 1, 2, 47, and 94.


, Follow the same process you used to find the numerator’s factors.

For example, the factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.


, This is the largest factor that the numerator and denominator share.You know you can simplify if the numerator and denominator share any factors other than 1. If the numerator and denominator do not share any other factors, the fraction is already simplified.

For example, the largest factor 94 and 16 share is 2. So, the fraction can be simplified.


, This will give you the new numerator and denominator of your simplified fraction.For example, 94÷2=47{\displaystyle 94\div 2=47}, so the simplified numerator is 47. To find the denominator, calculate 16÷2=8{\displaystyle 16\div 2=8}. So, the simplified fraction is 478{\displaystyle {\frac {47}{8}}}. Thus you can rename the mixed number 51416{\displaystyle 5{\frac {14}{16}}} as the improper fraction 478{\displaystyle {\frac {47}{8}}}.


, Make sure you simplify.

Multiply the whole number by the denominator: 2×6=12{\displaystyle 2\times 6=12}.

Add the numerator: 12+4=16{\displaystyle 12+4=16}.

Place the new numerator over the original denominator: 166{\displaystyle {\frac {16}{6}}}.

Determine whether the fraction can be simplified. Since the numerator and denominator are even numbers, the fraction can be simplified, since they can both be divided by 2.

List the factors of the numerator: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

List the factors of the denominator: 1, 2, 3, 6.

Identify the greatest common factor. Since the largest factor the numerator and denominator share is 2, this is the GCF.

Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF: 16÷2=8{\displaystyle 16\div 2=8} and 6÷2=3{\displaystyle 6\div 2=3}, so the fraction simplifies to 83{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{3}}}.


, Ava ate 1 brownie at the party. A little later, she ate three-quarters of a brownie. How many brownies did she eat all together?

Identify the mixed number. Since Ava ate 1 whole brownie, and then three-quarters of a brownie, altogether she ate 134{\displaystyle 1{\frac {3}{4}}} brownies.

Multiply the whole number by the denominator: 1×4=4{\displaystyle 1\times 4=4}.

Add the numerator: 4+3=7{\displaystyle 4+3=7}.

Place the new numerator over the original denominator: 74{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{4}}}.

Determine whether the fraction can be simplified. Since 7 is a prime number, the only factor the numerator and denominator share is 1, so the fraction cannot be further simplified.


, Convert each mixed number to an improper fraction first.

Convert the first mixed number into an improper fraction: 1×4+1=5{\displaystyle 1\times 4+1=5}, so the improper fraction is 54{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{4}}}.

Convert the second mixed number into an improper fraction: 1×4+3=7{\displaystyle 1\times 4+3=7}, so the improper fraction is 74{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{4}}}.

Add the two fractions using the normal  adding rules. Since these two fractions have the same denominator, you can simply add the numerators: 5+7=12{\displaystyle 5+7=12}, so 74+54=124{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{4}}+{\frac {5}{4}}={\frac {12}{4}}}.

Determine whether the fraction can be simplified. Since the numerator and denominator are both even, the fraction can be simplified.

Find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator. The greatest factor 12 and 4 share is 4.

Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF: 12÷4=3{\displaystyle 12\div 4=3} and 4÷4=1{\displaystyle 4\div 4=1}, so the fraction becomes 31{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{1}}}, which simplifies to 3.

For example, if you have 1/4 and 1/6, the lowest common denominator is 12. (4x3=12, 6x2=12)

, Remember that when you're doing this, you're not actually changing the number, just the terms in which it's expressed. Think of it like a pizza - 1/2 of a pizza and 2/4 of a pizza are the same amount.



Figure out how many times your current denominator goes into the lowest common denominator. For 1/4, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. For 1/6, 6 multiplied by 2 is 12.

Multiply the fraction's numerator and denominator by that number. For 1/4, you would multiply both 1 and 4 by 3, coming up with 3/12. 1/6 multiplied by 2 becomes 2/12. Now your problem looks like 3/12 + 2/12 or 3/12 - 2/12.

, The reason is because you are trying to say how many of that type of fraction you have, total. If you added the denominators as well, you would be changing what type of fractions they are.


For 3/12 + 2/12, your final answer is 5/12. For 3/12 - 2/12, it's 1/12

Write out the problem.,
Multiply the numerators of the two fractions.,
Multiply the denominators of the two fractions.,
Simplify.",How to Multiply Fractions1," The two fractions should be written down so that their numerators are aligned with their denominators.

Ex: 2/4 * 2/4;
, Since the numerators are both 2, you can multiply 2 * 2 to get 4.
, Since the denominators are both 4, just multiply 4 * 4 to get 16.

Your answer is a fraction comprised of the new numerator and the new denominator. Your answer is 4/16.

, To simplify a fraction, you have to divide its numerator and denominator by the largest number that can go into both numbers evenly. In the case of 4/16, 4 is the largest number that goes into both numbers evenly, so you should divide both the numerator and denominator by 4. Here's how you do it:

4/4 = 1
16/4 = 4
Your new fraction and final answer is 1/4.

Write out the problem.,
Simplify the first fraction.,
Simplify the second fraction.,
Multiply the numerators of both fractions.,
Multiply the denominators of both fractions.,
Place the new numerator over the new denominator.",How to Multiply Fractions2," The numerators and denominators of the two fractions should be aligned.


Ex: 2/4 * 2/4

, To simplify the first fraction, 2/4, simply divide its numerator and denominator by the largest number that can go into each number. Since the largest number that goes into both 2 and 4 is 2, you should divide both 2 and 4 by 2. Here's how to do it:


2/2 = 1
4/2 = 2
Your new fraction is 1/2. It is an equivalent fraction of 2/4, which means it has the same value.

You can also find the largest number that is divides into both the numerator and denominator by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of both numbers. To do this, simply list all the factors of those numbers, and choose the largest one that both share. Here's how:
2: 1, 2.
4: 1, 2, 4.
2 is the largest number that divides into both 2 and 4.



, To finish the process, you need to simplify the second fraction as well as the first. Since the second fraction, 2/4, is the same as the first, your answer will be the same.


2/4 = 1/2

, Multiply the numerators of the fractions 1/2 and 1/2, which are 1 and 1.


1 * 1 = 1.

, Multiply the denominators of the fractions 1/2 and 1/2, which are 2 and 2.


2 * 2 = 4.

, Since you already simplified at the beginning of the problem, you've found your final answer.


1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Find the reciprocal of a fraction by flipping it.,
Write the reciprocal of a whole number as a fraction.",How to Find the Reciprocal1," The definition of ""reciprocal"" is simple. To find the reciprocal of any number, just calculate ""1 ÷ (that number)."" For a fraction, the reciprocal is just a different fraction, with the numbers ""flipped"" upside down (inverted).For instance, the reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.;
, Again, the reciprocal of a number is always 1 ÷ (that number). For a whole number, write that as a fraction; there's no point in calculating it out to a decimal.


For instance, the reciprocal of 2 is 1 ÷ 2 = 1/2.

"
"
Identify a mixed number.,
Change it to an improper fraction.,
Flip the fraction.",How to Find the Reciprocal2," Mixed numbers are part whole number and part fraction, such as 24/5. There are two steps to finding the reciprocal of a mixed number, explained below.

, Remember, the number 1 can always be written as (number)/(the same number), and fractions with the same denominator (lower number) can be added together. Here's an example with 24/5:


24/5

= 1 + 1 + 4/5

= 5/5 + 5/5 + 4/5

= (5+5+4)/5

= 14/5.

, Once the number is written entirely as a fraction, you can find the reciprocal just like you would with any fraction: by flipping it.


In the example above, the reciprocal of 14/5 is 5/14.

"
"
Change it to a fraction if possible.,
Write out a division problem.,
Change the division problem to use whole numbers.,
Solve the problem using long division.",How to Find the Reciprocal3," You might recognize some common decimal numbers that can easily be turned into fractions. For instance, 0.5 = 1/2, and 0.25 = 1/4. Once in fraction form, just flip the fraction to find the reciprocal.


For instance, the reciprocal of 0.5 is 2/1 = 2.

, If you can't change it to a fraction, calculate the reciprocal of that number as a division problem: 1 ÷ (the decimal). You can use a calculator to solve this, or continue on to the next step to solve it by hand.


For example, you can find the reciprocal of 0.4 by calculating 1 ÷ 0.4.

, The first step to dividing decimals is to move the decimal point until all the numbers involved are whole numbers. As long as you move the decimal point the same number of spaces for both numbers, you'll get the correct answer.


For example, you can take 1 ÷ 0.4 and rewrite it as 10 ÷ 4. In this case, you've moved each decimal place one space to the right, which is the same as multiplying each number by ten.

, Use long division techniques to calculate the reciprocal. If you calculate it for 10 ÷ 4, you'll get the answer 2.5, the reciprocal of 0.4.

Multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number.,
Divide the numerator and denominator by the same number.",How to Find Equivalent Fractions1," Two fractions that are different but equivalent have, by definition, numerators and denominators that are multiples of each other. In other words, multiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number will produce an equivalent fraction. Though the numbers in the new fraction will be different, the fractions will have the same value.


For instance, if we take the fraction 4/8 and multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get (4×2)/(8×2) = 8/16. These two fractions are equivalent.
(4×2)/(8×2) is essentially the same as 4/8 × 2/2 Remember that when multiplying two fractions, we multiply across, meaning numerator to numerator and denominator to denominator.
Notice that 2/2 equals 1 when you carry out the division. Thus, it's easy to see why 4/8 and 8/16 are equivalent since multiplying 4/8 × (2/2) = 4/8 still. The same way it’s fair to say that 4/8 = 8/16.
Any given fraction has an infinite number of equivalent fractions. You can multiply the numerator and denominator by any whole number, no matter how large or small to obtain an equivalent fraction.;
, Like multiplication, division can also be used to find a new fraction that's equivalent to your starting fraction. Simply divide the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same number to obtain an equivalent fraction. There is one caveat to this process--the resulting fraction must have whole numbers in both the numerator and denominator to be valid.


For instance, let's look at 4/8 again. If, instead of multiplying, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get (4 ÷ 2)/(8 ÷ 2) = 2/4. 2 and 4 are both whole numbers, so this equivalent fraction is valid.

"
Find the number by which the smaller denominator needs to be multiplied to make the larger denominator.,
Multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction expressed in lower terms by the number from the first step.",How to Find Equivalent Fractions2," Many problems regarding fractions involve determining if two fractions are equivalent. By calculating this number, you can begin putting the fractions in the same terms to determine equivalency.


For example, take the fractions 4/8 and 8/16 again. The smaller denominator is 8, and we would have to multiply that number x2 in order to make the larger denominator, which is 16. Therefore, the number in this case is 2.
For more difficult numbers, you can simply divide the larger denominator by the smaller denominator. In this case 16 divided by 8, which still gets us 2.
The number may not always be a whole number. For example, if the denominators were 2 and 7, then the number would be 3.5.

, Two fractions that are different but equivalent have, by definition, numerators and denominators that are multiples of each other. In other words, multiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number will produce an equivalent fraction. Though the numbers in this new fraction will be different, the fractions will have the same value.For instance, if we take the fraction 4/8 from step one and multiply both the numerator and denominator by our previously determined number 2, we get (4×2)/(8×2) = 8/16. Thus proving that these two fractions are equivalent.

"
"
Calculate each fraction as a decimal number.,
Divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number to get an equivalent fraction.,
Reduce the fractions to their lowest terms.",How to Find Equivalent Fractions3," For simple fractions without variables, you can simply express each fraction as a decimal number to determine equivalency. Since every fraction is actually a division problem to begin with, this is the simplest way to determine equivalency.


For instance, take our previously used 4/8. The fraction 4/8 is equivalent to saying 4 divided by 8, which 4/8 = 0.5. You can solve for the other example as well, which is 8/16 = 0.5. Regardless of the terms of a fraction, they are equivalent if the two numbers are exactly the same when expressed as a decimal.
Remember that the decimal expression may go several digits before the lack of equivalence becomes apparent. As a basic example, 1/3 = 0.333 repeating while 3/10 = 0.3. By using more than one digit, we see that these two fractions are not equivalent.

, For more complex fractions, the division method requires additional steps. As with the multiplication method, you can divide the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same number to obtain an equivalent fraction. There is one caveat to this process. The resulting fraction must have whole numbers in both the numerator and denominator to be valid.


For instance, let's look at 4/8 again. If, instead of multiplying, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get (4 ÷ 2)/(8 ÷ 2) = 2/4. 2 and 4 are both whole numbers, so this equivalent fraction is valid.

, Most fractions should typically be expressed in their lowest terms, and you can convert fractions to their simplest terms by dividing by their greatest common factor (GCF). This step operates by the same logic of expressing equivalent fractions by converting them to have the same denominator, but this method seeks to reduce each fraction to its lowest expressible terms.


When a fraction is in its simplest terms, its numerator and denominator are both as small as they can be. Neither can be divided by the any whole number to obtain anything smaller. To convert a fraction that's not in simplest terms to an equivalent form that is, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.
The greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator is the largest number that divides into both to give a whole number result. So, in our 4/8 example, since 4 is the largest number that divides evenly into both 4 and 8, we would divide the numerator and denominator of our fraction by 4 to get it in simplest terms. (4 ÷ 4)/(8 ÷ 4) = 1/2. For our other example of 8/16, the GCF is 8, which also results in 1/2 as the simplest expression of the fraction.

"
Set the two fractions equal to one another.,
Take the two equivalent fractions and multiply across the equals sign in an ""X"" shape.,
Introduce a variable.,
Use cross multiplication for equations with multiple variables or variable expressions.",How to Find Equivalent Fractions4," We use cross multiplication for math problems where we know the fractions are equivalent, but one of the numbers has been replaced with a variable (typically x) for which we must solve. In cases like this, we know these fractions are equivalent because they're the sole terms on opposite sides of an equal sign, but it's often not obvious how to solve for the variable. Luckily, with cross multiplication, solving these types of problems is easy., In other words, you multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and vice versa, then set these two answers equal to each other and solve.Take our two examples of 4/8 and 8/16. These two don't contain a variable, but we can prove the concept since we already know they're equivalent. By cross multiplying, we get 4 x 16 = 8 x 8, or 64 = 64, which is obviously true. If the two numbers are not the same, then the fractions are not equivalent.

, Since cross multiplication is the easiest way to determine equivalent fractions when you must solve for a variable, let's add a variable.


For example, let's consider the equation 2/x = 10/13. To cross multiply, we multiply 2 by 13 and 10 by x, then set our answers equal to each other:

2 × 13 = 26
10 × x = 10x
10x = 26. From here, getting an answer for our variable is a matter of simple algebra. x = 26/10 = 2.6, making the initial equivalent fractions 2/2.6 = 10/13.



, One of the best things about cross multiplication is that it works in essentially the same way whether you're dealing with two simple fractions (as above) or with more complex fractions. For instance, if both fractions contain variables, you just have to eliminate these variables at the end during the solving process. Similarly, if the numerators or denominators of your fractions contain variable expressions (such as x + 1), simply ""multiply through""by using the distributive property and solve as you normally would.For instance, let's consider the equation ((x + 3)/2) = ((x + 1)/4). In this case, as above, we'll solve by cross multiplying:

(x + 3) × 4 = 4x + 12
(x + 1) × 2 = 2x + 2
2x + 2 = 4x + 12, then we can simplify the equation by subtracting 2x from both sides
2 = 2x + 12, then we should isolate the variable by subtracting 12 from both sides
-10 = 2x, and divide by 2 to solve for x

-5 = x

Cross multiply the two fractions.,
Express the equation as a quadratic equation.,
Solve by plugging the numbers from your quadratic equation into the quadratic formula.,
Check your answer by plugging the x value back into your quadratic equation.",How to Find Equivalent Fractions5," For equivalency problems that require the quadratic formula, we still begin by using cross multiplication. However, any cross multiplication that involves multiplying variable terms by other variable terms is likely to result in an expression that can't easily be solved via algebra. In cases like these, you may need to use techniques like factoring and/or the Quadratic Formula.For example, let's look at the equation ((x +1)/3) = (4/(2x - 2)). First, let's cross multiply:

(x + 1) × (2x - 2) = 2x2 + 2x -2x - 2 = 2x2 - 2
4 × 3 = 12
2x2 - 2 = 12.



, At this point, we want to express this equation in quadratic form (ax2 + bx + c = 0), which we do by setting the equation equal to zero. In this case, we subtract 12 from both sides to get 2x2 - 14 = 0.


Some values may equal 0. Though 2x2 - 14 = 0 is the simplest form of our equation, the true quadratic equation is 2x2 + 0x + (-14) = 0. It will probably help early on to mirror the form of the quadratic equation even when some values are 0.

, The quadratic formula (x = (-b +/- √(b2 - 4ac))/2a) will help us solve for our value x at this point.Don’t be intimidated by the length of the formula. You’re simply taking the values from your quadratic equation in step two and plugging them into the appropriate spots before solving.


x = (-b +/- √(b2 - 4ac))/2a. In our equation, 2x2 - 14 = 0, a = 2, b = 0, and c = -14.
x = (-0 +/- √(02 - 4(2)(-14)))/2(2)
x = (+/- √( 0 - -112))/2(2)
x = (+/- √(112))/2(2)
x = (+/- 10.58/4)
x = +/- 2.64


, By plugging the calculated value of x back into your quadratic equation from step two, you can easily determine if you reached the correct answer.In this example, you would plug both 2.64 and -2.64 into the original quadratic equation.

Round the fractions.Rounding fractions makes them easier to deal with.,
Choose a suitable number of rounding options.,
Choose a rounding option for each of your fractions.,
Keep your rounding changes in mind.,
Compare your estimation with the precise fractions.",How to Estimate Fractions1," Estimating a fraction will give you the gist of the fraction. However, you'll seldom guess the exact answer with it. If you only need a general idea of the answer, estimations are helpful. However, if you need to give an exact answer, solve your equation with exact measurements. A good estimation will convey the general idea across quickly, and won't attempt to pass itself off as an exact answer.


Examples of situations that favour estimations include planning casual events (roughly gauging supplies needed), expressing an idea verbally (getting the idea across without the nitty-gritty details) or some cooking situations like stews, where exact measurements aren't needed in the final product.;
, A fraction listed as 4/8, for example, can be expressed as 2/4 or 1/2. These are different ways of expressing the exact same fraction. It's a good idea to simplify your fractions however possible in order to make your estimating easier. Find a number you can divide the top and bottom half of a fraction by equally. Dividing them by the same number will reduce the size of the numbers, while keeping the proportions intact.


Smaller numbers are generally easier to work with than big numbers. If all of the numbers included share a common denominator, it's possible to divide them by that root accordingly. For example, 4/16 and 6/8 could be divided by 4 and 2 respectively. This would result in 1/4 and 3/4.Generally speaking, if both the top and bottom of your fraction are even, you can divide both sides by 2. Both sides will be only half as big as before, and the proportion will remain the same.
Make sure you keep both sides of your fraction whole while dividing. Making fractions out of fractions by dividing denominators improperly will make your fraction much more frustrating to deal with.

, If you have a fraction that can't be simplified as is, moving it slightly up or down can allow you to simplify at the cost of the ""exact"" answer. Rounding fractions up or down will depend on a lot of things, specifically whether you're dealing with a lot of very specific fractions, and whether there are few enough parts to still make sense.


""Rounding"" a fraction means bringing it slightly up or down so that the fraction may be simplified. For example, 7/16 may be a tricky fraction to visualize mentally, but if you round it up slightly to 8/16, it becomes exactly half (1/2) of the whole.

, If you're intent on using mental math, it's a good idea to try to round your fractions down to proportions you're most comfortable with. Because personal skills with mental math will depend on the individual, you can make the rounding as big or small as you'd like. Rounding to halves (0, 1/2, 1) only makes sense for the simplest fractions, while more complex proportions will benefit from a greater number of rounding options.


Rounding your fractions into smaller portions (like eighths or sixteenths) may be more difficult depending on your level of skill, but you'll find your answer is closer to the real answer., Most of the time, a fraction will be closer to one of its adjacent rounding options than the other. 7/8, for example, is closer to 1 (8/8) than 1/2 (4/8). In some cases however, it may lie somewhere in the middle. A fraction like 65/100 can be rounded up or down to 60/100 or 70/100. You can make a decision on which you think best represents the data given. Mapping out a number line will help indicate visually what rounding option a fraction is closest to.Although it may go without saying, you won't need to do anything to fractions that already fall on one of your rounding options.

, Although rounding fractions up and down could be helpful for the sake of estimating, it's important that you don't take these new proportions as an accurate report of the real proportions.Keep the original, precise fractions at hand. Having both the exact and estimated versions available is useful, because you'll be able to communicate the idea easily, as well as back it up with the hard data when needed.

, Once you have a rounded, simplified estimation you're comfortable with, you can sharpen your estimation further by propping it up against the original fraction. This way, you can identify how your estimate might vary from the real number. While an estimate is a great way to visualize or think broadly about the data, you should reflect on how close your fraction really is.


A 7/16 fraction could be rounded up to 8/16 (or 1/2). 7/16 may still be seen roughly as a half, but you should remember that the simplified version is slightly more than the real number. A mathematical way of expressing this would be: (1/2 - 1/16).

Gauge the validity of a visual estimation.,
Choose a visual model.Different visual models will fit different people.,
Illustrate fractions with physical pieces.,
Stack your proportions beside one another.Relative fractions are all around us, and we often make choices based on estimating fractions without even thinking about it.,
Make a pie chart.",How to Estimate Fractions2," Communicating a fraction visually makes it apparent to other people. They're a perfect way to express proportions to others, especially if those people don't have a mathematical background. Visual estimations are best-suited for comparing one fraction against another. The human eye is trained to compare and measure things, even without mathematical experience. Putting something in visual terms helps to ease the mind from purely abstract, numbers-based thinking. Visual estimations are also perfect for use in casual, ""real life"" settings.For example, a 12/16 fraction may look bigger than 7/8 in a purely numerical form, but a simple graph of the two next to each other will easily show the latter is bigger than the former.
The two main types of visually-illustrated fractions are line and circle graphs.Lines are best for measurements, whereas circles (or ""pie charts"") are best for showing proportions.

, Whether you want to use a pie chart, rectangle, chart or some other way of visualizing your proportions, an illustration of a fraction will give you a reference point to think about it in more concrete terms.


Different proportions can be indicated by different shades or colours. For example, two shaded thirds of a pie circle indicates a 2/3 fraction.
It's a good idea to play around with a few visual models using the same set of fractions. This will show you how different models can represent the same thing.

, Using chocolate pieces, building blocks or even pebbles, you can estimate your fractions by setting different pieces into groups. A fraction with 50 parts (17/50+33/50) can be expressed by separating 50 pieces into two groups. With that, you'll be able to visually see how one fraction sizes up to the other.


By illustrating two or more proportions next to one another, you'll have an easy visual reference as to which fractions are biggest, and which are smallest. The human eye will be able to identify the distinction almost without thinking, so it's a nice way to communicate it in clear terms., If you're looking for a way to practice your fraction estimating, put two items of different heights next to each other. From there, try to guess what proportion of the larger object's size is matched by the smaller one.


You can check your answers by placing a ruler and measuring the appropriate dimensions of your items after the fact.

, Pie charts are a great way of expressing proportions in a visual way. If you're a visual thinker, it's a good idea to work your rounded fractions into a circle. From there, you can express your estimation without having to rely on rounded numbers that may not be accurate. Unlike graphs (which tend to rely on exact data) a pie chart is supposed to be a quick way of showing visual data. It's generally easier to visually analyze the parts of a circle than other visual models, as a full circle represents a whole.

For example, if you want to calculate 612÷214{\displaystyle 6{\frac {1}{2}}\div 2{\frac {1}{4}}}, you would multiply 6×2=12{\displaystyle 6\times 2=12} and 2×4=8{\displaystyle 2\times 4=8}.
;
, This sum will be the numerator of your improper fraction. for





For example, 12+1=13{\displaystyle 12+1=13} and 8+1=9{\displaystyle 8+1=9}.


, These are your improper fractions that you will use to complete the division.





For example, 612{\displaystyle 6{\frac {1}{2}}} becomes 132{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{2}}} and 214{\displaystyle 2{\frac {1}{4}}} becomes 94{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{4}}}.


, If you are working with any whole numbers, you need to convert them to fractions. To do this, turn the number into the numerator of a fraction. The denominator will be 1.




For example, 3=31{\displaystyle 3={\frac {3}{1}}}.


, Use the improper fractions you found by completing the calculations in Part 1. 





For example, 132÷94{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{2}}\div {\frac {9}{4}}}.


,




For example, if you take the reciprocal of 94{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{4}}}, it becomes 49{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{9}}}. So 132÷94{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{2}}\div {\frac {9}{4}}} becomes 132×49{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{2}}\times {\frac {4}{9}}}


, To do this, multiply them as if they were whole numbers. This product will be the numerator of your answer.




For example, if calculating 132×49{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{2}}\times {\frac {4}{9}}}, you would multiply the numerators: 13×4=52{\displaystyle 13\times 4=52}.


, To do this, multiply them as if they were whole numbers. This product will be the denominator of your answer.




For example, if calculating 132×49{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{2}}\times {\frac {4}{9}}}, you would multiply the denominators: 2×9=18{\displaystyle 2\times 9=18}. Putting together your numerator and denominator, your answer becomes 5218{\displaystyle {\frac {52}{18}}}.


, To simplify, or reduce, a fraction, you need to find the greatest factor (besides 1) that is common to the numerator and the denominator. Then, divide the numerator and denominator by that factor. For more information on this process, read Reduce Fractions.





For example, 52{\displaystyle 52} and 18{\displaystyle 18} are both divisible by 2{\displaystyle 2}.52÷2=26{\displaystyle 52\div 2=26}18÷2=9{\displaystyle 18\div 2=9}So, 5218=269{\displaystyle {\frac {52}{18}}={\frac {26}{9}}}


, If there is no remainder, then your answer is a whole number rather than a mixed number, and you need not do anything further. Likely, though, you will have a remainder. Set this aside for now. The quotient you found when Dividing the numerator by the denominator will be the whole number of your mixed number.




For example, 26÷9=2{\displaystyle 26\div 9=2} with a remainder of 8{\displaystyle 8}. Thus, the whole number of your mixed number will be 2.


, Place this numerator over the original denominator. This will give you the fraction of your mixed number.




For example, if your original denominator is 9{\displaystyle 9} and your remainder is 8{\displaystyle 8}, the fraction of your mixed number is 89{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{9}}}.


, This gives you the final answer to your original division problem.

To begin, you must be able to identify what specific outcomes are possible. You should either list these or create a table to help define the results.For example, suppose you have a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and you want to find the expected value, over time, of a single card that you select at random. You need to list all possible outcomes, which are:

Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, in each of four different suits.

In some cases, you may need to assign a value to some or all possible outcomes. This might be the case, for example, in a laboratory experiment where you might assign a value of +1 to a positive chemical reaction, a value of -1 to a negative chemical reaction, and a value of 0 if no reaction occurred.In the example of the playing cards, traditional values are Ace = 1, face cards all equal 10, and all other cards have a value equal to the number shown on the card. Assign those values for this example.


, Probability is the chance that each particular value or outcome may occur. In some situations, like the stock market, for example, probabilities may be affected by some external forces. You would need to be provided with some additional information before you could calculate the probabilities in these examples. In a problem of random chance, such as rolling dice or flipping coins, probability is defined as the percentage of a given outcome divided by the total number of possible outcomes.For example, with a fair coin, the probability of flipping a “Head” is 1/2, because there is one Head, divided by a total of two possible outcomes (Heads or Tails).

In the example with the playing cards, there are 52 cards in the deck, so each individual card has a probability of 1/52. However, recognize that there are four different suits, and there are, for example, multiple ways to draw a value of 10. It may help to make a table of probabilities, as follows:

1 = 4/52

2 = 4/52

3 = 4/52

4 = 4/52

5 = 4/52

6 = 4/52

7 = 4/52

8 = 4/52

9 = 4/52

10 = 16/52



Check that the sum of all your probabilities adds up to a total of 1. Since your list of outcomes should represent all the possibilities, the sum of probabilities should equal 1. 


, Each possible outcome represents a portion of the total expected value for the problem or experiment that you are calculating. To find the partial value due to each outcome, multiply the value of the outcome times its probability.For the playing card example, use the table of probabilities that you just created. Multiply the value of each card times its respective probability. These calculations will look like this:


1∗452=452{\displaystyle 1*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {4}{52}}}


2∗452=852{\displaystyle 2*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {8}{52}}}


3∗452=1252{\displaystyle 3*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {12}{52}}}


4∗452=1652{\displaystyle 4*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {16}{52}}}


5∗452=2052{\displaystyle 5*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {20}{52}}}


6∗452=2452{\displaystyle 6*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {24}{52}}}


7∗452=2852{\displaystyle 7*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {28}{52}}}


8∗452=3252{\displaystyle 8*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {32}{52}}}


9∗452=3652{\displaystyle 9*{\frac {4}{52}}={\frac {36}{52}}}


10∗1652=16052{\displaystyle 10*{\frac {16}{52}}={\frac {160}{52}}}




, The expected value (EV) of a set of outcomes is the sum of the individual products of the value times its probability. Using whatever chart or table you have created to this point, add up the products, and the result will be the expected value for the problem.For the example of the playing cards, the expected value is the sum of the ten separate products. This result will be:


EV=4+8+12+16+20+24+28+32+36+16052{\displaystyle {\text{EV}}={\frac {4+8+12+16+20+24+28+32+36+160}{52}}}


EV=34052{\displaystyle {\text{EV}}={\frac {340}{52}}}


EV=6.538{\displaystyle {\text{EV}}=6.538}




, The EV applies best when you will be performing the described test or experiment over many, many times. For example, EV applies well to gambling situations to describe expected results for thousands of gamblers per day, repeated day after day after day. However, the EV does not very accurately predict one particular outcome on one specific test.For example, when drawing a playing card from a standard deck, on one specific draw, the likelihood of drawing a 2 is equal to the likelihood of drawing a 6 or 7 or 8 or any other numbered card. 

Over many many draws, the theoretical value to expect is 6.538. Obviously, there is no “6.538” card in the deck. But if you were gambling, you would expect to draw a card higher than 6 more often than not.

Define all possible outcomes.,
Assign values to each possible outcome.,
Determine the probability of each outcome.,
Multiply each outcome value by its respective probability.,
Add together all the products.,
Interpret the results.",How to Calculate an Expected Value2," Calculating EV is a very useful tool in investments and stock market predictions. As with any EV problem, you must begin by defining all possible outcomes. Generally, real world situations are not as easily definable as something like rolling dice or drawing cards. For that reason, analysts will create models that approximate stock market situations and use those models for their predictions.Suppose, for this example, that you can define 4 distinct results for your investment. These results are:

1. Earn an amount equal to your investment

2. Earn back half your investment

3. Neither gain nor lose

4. Lose your entire investment




, In some cases, you may be able to assign a specific dollar value to the possible outcomes. Other times, in the case of a model, you may need to assign a value or score that represents monetary amounts.In the investment model, for simplicity, assume you invest $1. The assigned value of each outcome will be positive if you expect to earn money and negative if you expect to lose. In this problem, the four possible outcomes therefore have the following values, relative to the $1 investment:

1. Earn an amount equal to your investment = +1

2. Earn back half your investment = +0.5

3. Neither gain nor lose = 0

4. Lose your entire investment = -1




, In a situation like the stock market, professional analysts spend their entire careers trying to determine the likelihood that any given stock will go up or down on any given day. The probability of the outcomes usually depends on many external factors. Statisticians will work together with market analysts to assign reasonable probabilities to prediction models.For this example, assume that the probability of each of the four outcomes is equal, at 25%.


, Use your list of all possible outcomes, and multiply each value times the probability of that value occurring.For the model investment situation, these calculations would look like this:

1. Earn an amount equal to your investment = +1 * 25% = 0.25

2. Earn back half your investment = +0.5 * 25% = 0.125

3. Neither gain nor lose = 0 * 25% = 0

4. Lose your entire investment = -1 * 25% = -0.25




, Find the EV for the given situation by adding together the products of value times probability, for all possible outcomes.The EV, for the stock investment model, is as follows:


EV=0.25+0.125+0−0.25=0.125{\displaystyle {\text{EV}}=0.25+0.125+0-0.25=0.125}




, You need to read the statistical calculation of the EV and make sense of it in real world terms, according to the problem.For the investment model, a positive EV suggests that over time, you will earn money on your investments. Specifically, based on an investment of $1, you can expect to earn 12.5 cents, or 12.5% of your investment. 

Earning 12.5 cents does not sound impressive. However, applying the calculation to large numbers suggests, for example, that an investment of $1,000,000 would earn $125,000.

Familiarize yourself with the problem.,
Identify all possible outcomes.,
Assign a value to each outcome.,
Determine the probability of each outcome.,
Multiply each value times its respective probability.,
Calculate the sum of the products.,
Interpret the result.",How to Calculate an Expected Value3," Before thinking about all the possible outcomes and probabilities involved, make sure to understand the problem. For example, consider a die-rolling game that costs $10 per play. A 6-sided die is rolled once, and your cash winnings depend on the number rolled. Rolling a 6 wins you $30. Rolling a 5 wins you $20. Rolling any other number results in no payout.
, This is a relatively simple gambling game. Because you are rolling one die, there are only six possible outcomes on any one roll. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
, This gambling game has asymmetric values assigned to the various rolls, according to the rules of the game. For each possible roll of the die, assign the value to be the amount of money that you will either earn or lose. Recognize that a “no payout” means you lose your $10 bet. The values for all six possible outcomes are as follows:

1 = -$10

2 = -$10

3 = -$10

4 = -$10

5 = $20 win - $10 bet = +$10 net value

6 = $30 win - $10 bet = +$20 net value


, In this game, you are presumably rolling  a fair, six-sided die. Therefore, the probability of each outcome is 1/6. You may leave this probability as the fraction of 1/6 or convert it to a decimal by dividing on a calculator. The equivalent decimal is 1/6 = 0.167.
, Use the table of values you calculated for all six die rolls, and multiply each value times the probability of 0.167:

1 = -$10 * 0.167 = -1.67

2 = -$10 * 0.167 = -1.67

3 = -$10 * 0.167 = -1.67

4 = -$10 * 0.167 = -1.67

5 = $20 win - $10 bet = +$10 net value * 0.167 = +1.67

6 = $30 win - $10 bet = +$20 net value * 0.167 = +3.34


, Add together the six probability-value calculations to find the EV for the overall game. This calculation is:


EV=−1.67−1.67−1.67−1.67+1.67+3.34=−1.67{\displaystyle {\text{EV}}=-1.67-1.67-1.67-1.67+1.67+3.34=-1.67}


, The EV for this gambling game is -1.67. In real world terms, this means that you can expect to lose $1.67 each time you play the game. Notice that, according to the rules of the game, it is impossible to lose $1.67. Your only options for each $10 bet are to win $30, win $20, or win nothing. However, on average, if you play this game many times, you can expect the outcome to equal an overall loss of $1.67 per play.

If you play the game once, you might win $30 (net +$20). If you play a second time, you could even win again, for a total of $60 (net +$40). However, that luck is not going to continue if you keep playing. If you play 100 times, in the end you are likely to be down approximately $167.

,
Write the reciprocal of the whole number.,
Change the division sign into a multiplication sign.,
Multiply the numerators and denominators of the fractions.,
Simplify the fraction.",How to Divide Fractions by a Whole Number," The first step to dividing a fraction by a whole number is to simply write out the fraction followed by the division sign and the whole number you need to divide it by. Let's say we're working with the following problem: 2/3 ÷ 4., To change a whole number into a fraction, all you have to do is place the number over the number 1. The whole number becomes the numerator and 1 becomes the denominator of the fraction. Saying 4/1 is really the same as saying 4, since you're just showing that the number includes ""1"" 4 times. The problem should read 2/3 ÷ 4/1.

,, To find the reciprocal of a number, simply switch the numerator and the denominator of the number. Therefore, to find the reciprocal of 4/1, simply switch the numerator and denominator so that the number becomes 1/4.

, The problem should read 2/3 x 1/4.

, Therefore, the next step is to multiply the numerators and denominators of the fraction to get the new numerator and denominator of the final answer.


To multiply the numerators, just multiply 2 x 1 to get 2.






To multiply the denominators, just multiply 3 x 4 to get 12.






2/3 x 1/4 = 2/12







, To simply the fraction, you need to find the lowest common denominator, which means that you should divide both the numerator and denominator by any number that divides evenly into both numbers. Since 2 is the numerator, you should see if 2 divides evenly into 12 -- it does because 12 is even. Then, divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the new numerator and denominator to get a simplified answer.


2 ÷ 2 = 1






12 ÷ 2 = 6






The fraction 2/12 can be simplified to 1/6. This is your final answer.

Write down the phenomenon you'd like to test.,
Select a sample from your chosen population.,
Calculate your sample mean and sample standard deviation.,
Choose your desired confidence level.,
Calculate your margin of error.,
State your confidence interval.",How to Calculate Confidence Interval," Let's say you're working with the following situation: The average weight of a male student in ABC University is 180 lbs. You'll be testing how accurately you will be able to predict the weight of male students in ABC university within a given confidence interval.;
, This is what you will use to gather data for testing your hypothesis. Let's say you've randomly selected 1,000 male students.

, Choose a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample standard deviation) that you want to use to estimate your chosen population parameter. A population parameter is a value that represents a particular population characteristic. Here's how you can find your sample mean and sample standard deviation:


To calculate the sample mean of the data, just add up all of the weights of the 1,000 men you selected and divide the result by 1000, the number of men. This should have given you the average weight of 180 lbs.
To calculate the sample standard deviation, you will have to find the mean, or the average of the data. Next, you'll have to find the variance of the data, or the average of the squared differences from the mean. Once you find this number, just take its square root. Let's say the standard deviation here is 30 lbs. (Note that this information can sometimes be provided for you during a statistics problem.)

, The most commonly used confidence levels are 90 percent, 95 percent and 99 percent. This may also be provided for you in the course of a problem. Let's say you've chosen 95%.

, You can find the margin of error by using the following formula: Za/2 * σ/√(n). Za/2 = the confidence coefficient, where a = confidence level, σ = standard deviation, and n = sample size. This is another way of saying that you should multiply the critical value by the standard error. Here's how you can solve this formula by breaking it into parts:


To find the critical value, or Za/2: Here, the confidence level is 95%. Convert the percentage to a decimal, .95, and divide it by 2 to get .475. Then, check out the z table to find the corresponding value that goes with .475. You'll see that the closest value is 1.96, at the intersection of row 1.9 and the column of .06.
To find the standard error, take the standard deviation, 30, and divide it by the square root of the sample size, 1,000. You get 30/31.6, or .95 lbs.
Multiply 1.96 by .95 (your critical value by your standard error) to get 1.86, your margin of error.

, To state the confidence interval, you just have to take the mean, or the average (180), and write it next to ± and the margin of error. The answer is: 180 ± 1.86. You can find the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the mean. So, your lower bound is 180 - 1.86, or 178.14, and your upper bound is 180 + 1.86, or 181.86.


You can also use this handy formula in finding the confidence interval: x̅ ± Za/2 * σ/√(n). Here, x̅ represents the mean.

"Calculate Pie Chart Proportions

Use a mathematical compass to draw a circle.,
Draw the radius.,
Place your protractor on the circle.,
Draw each section division.,
Color each segment.",How to Make a Pie Chart,",, This number will be your denominator.








,, To do this, multiply each percentage (still in decimal form) by 360.









The logic behind this is that there are 360 degrees in a circle. If you know that 14,400 is 30 percent of the whole (or 0.30), then you're calculating 30% of 360 which is 108.
Check your work. Add up the number of degrees you calculated for each data point. They should total 360. If not, you've missed something and should double-check your work.

, To draw a pie chart accurately, you need to start with a perfect circle. This can be done using a compass (and a protractor to measure the angles). If you don't have a compass, try tracing around a circle template, using something round such as a lid or a CD.








, Start in the exact center of the circle and draw a straight line to the outside of the circle. (Hint: make a dot with the compass to find the center.)









The straight line can be vertical (12 or 6 o'clock on the clock face) or horizontal (9 or 3 o'clock on the clock face). The segments you create then follow either a clockwise or counter-clockwise sequence.

, Position it on the circle so that the 90 degrees crosshair is situated directly above the center of the circle. The zero point should be vertically aligned along the vertical plot line.








, Draw the sections by marking the first division against the edge of the protractor at the correct angle, using the angle formulations you got in the earlier step. Each time you add a section, the radius changes to the line you just drew; rotate your protractor accordingly.









When marking the angle lines, make sure they are sharp and fine, to keep them clear and easy to see.

, You can use color, patterns or just words, depending on what meets your purpose best. Add the name of each section and the percent it represents in the chart.









Color each section of the pie chart a different color/pattern to easily visualize the results.
If you drew everything in pencil first, always ink in the circle before coloring in any of the segments. This is because the circle is the trickiest part to draw accurately.
Labels or words added to each segment should be written horizontally and centered (the same visual distance from the edge for each segment). This makes them easier to read.

Use fractions to understand the parts of a whole object.,
Know that the top number, or the numerator, represents how many of your object you've got.,
Know that the bottom number, or the denominator, represents your whole.,
Know that having a bigger numerator than denominator means you have more than one object.",How to Solve Fractions1," Fractions aren't easy to think about. However, you use fractions all of the time without even knowing it. Fractions are just ways to break down something bigger into parts. They are also, if you've covered it, simply undivided division problems. For example, if you want to share 10 cookies among 20 people fairly, then you'd be splitting 10 cookies among 20 people, or 1020{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{20}}}. Another way to look at this is by saying each person gets 1020th{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{20}}th} of a cookie. Later on, you can learn to simplify 1020{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{20}}} to make it easier to divide the cookies. Common fractions include:Half of something is represented by 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.

A quarter coin is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of a dollar. This makes sense, since four quarters equals a dollar.

Percentages, like getting 90% on a test, is the equivalent of a fraction over 100. It says that you got roughly 90 out of 100 questions, or points, right.;
, For example, if you ate 2 slices of the pie, you'd have eaten 28ths{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}ths} of the whole pizza. The top number in a fraction is called the numerator.
, Continuing the pizza example, the bottom number in a fraction would represent the total number of slices. For example, if the pizza is cut into 8 slices, one slice would be 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} of the total pizza. If you cut it into 10 slices, then one fraction would be 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}} of the pizza.

When the numerator and denominator are the same, you are back to one. So, if you ate 8 of 8 slices, or 88ths{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{8}}ths}, you'd have eaten one whole pizza.


, If you eat a massive 10 slices of pizza, but the pizza was only cut into 8 slices, it must mean there were 2 pizzas. So if you have 108ths{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{8}}ths} of something, you must have more than one, otherwise, where would the two extra slices come from. Any fraction where the numerator is bigger than the denominator is called an improper fraction. You can convert improper fractions to make them easier to read:

Subtract the bottom number by the top as many times as possible, counting each time. You can only subtract 8 from 10 once.

This is your number of full pizzas.



Leave the remainder as the numerator. Once you subtract 8 from 10, you have 2 slices left over, leave them above the 8. 

Combine your two numbers into a ""mixed"" fraction. If you ate 108ths{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{8}}ths} of a pizza, you could also say you ate 1 & 28ths{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}ths} of a pizza. They are the same number."

Simplifying just takes the numerator and denominator and removes any common numbers, called factors. Before going further, note a few examples of simplification to understand the process.


28{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}} → 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}


10100{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{100}}} → 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}}


633{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{33}}} → 211{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{11}}}, Factors are the building blocks of other numbers. Basically, a factor is any number that could be used, with multiplication, to make any other number. Take the number 50, for example. What numbers could be multiplied together to make 50? You could use 10∗5{\displaystyle 10*5}, or 25∗2{\displaystyle 25*2}, for example. But some of these numbers, like 10 and 25, can be simplified even further. Factoring just continues this process all the way down until you have your basic parts. So, with 50:


50=25∗2{\displaystyle 50=25*2}


25=5∗5{\displaystyle 25=5*5}

The factors of 50 are 5, 5, and 2.Try this same process, but start with 50=10∗5{\displaystyle 50=10*5} instead. You will get the same factors!If you continue to have trouble, study up on factorization.


, Take the fraction 1866{\displaystyle {\frac {18}{66}}}, which seems much too odd to simplify into something easy. However, you can make the number much more manageable if you start factoring. Simply replace 18 with your simply factored numbers.18=9∗2{\displaystyle 18=9*2}


9=3∗3{\displaystyle 9=3*3}

6=2∗3{\displaystyle 6=2*3}


Simplified Denominator: 3∗3∗211∗3∗2{\displaystyle {\frac {3*3*2}{11*3*2}}}


, If the numbers are identical, cross them off. You can only do this once for each identical number. Not for example, that while there are two 3s in the top of or fraction, there is only one on the bottom, so we can only cross out one. Finishing the example (1866{\displaystyle {\frac {18}{66}}}) from before:


3∗3∗211∗3∗2{\displaystyle {\frac {3*3*2}{11*3*2}}}


1866{\displaystyle {\frac {18}{66}}} simplifies to:311{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{11}}}, Once you have the basics of simplification down, test yourself with some practice problems.

56∗210=1060{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}*{\frac {2}{10}}={\frac {10}{60}}}


45∗25=85{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}*{\frac {2}{5}}={\frac {8}{5}}}


13x178=1724{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}x{\frac {17}{8}}={\frac {17}{24}}}., Division is only slightly harder than multiplication. To do it, all you have to do is flip the second fraction, the one you're using to divide, and then multiply. For example, to solve the problem ""12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} divided by 214{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{14}}},"" you would:


Identify the divisor. This is the fraction you are dividing with: 214{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{14}}}.


Flip the divisor. 214=142{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{14}}={\frac {14}{2}}}


Multiply the new fraction by the first one. So your problem becomes 12∗142=144{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}*{\frac {14}{2}}={\frac {14}{4}}}.


Simplify the answer. 2 is a common factor in both 14 and 4, so you're final, simplified answer is 72{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{2}}}, This is the exact same method for division, just with a simple shortcut. Instead of flipping a fraction over, simply multiply the top of one fraction by the bottom of the other. If you were to draw lines between the two sets of numbers you're multiplying, you would get an ""X."" This is simply another way to visualize division.Keep the order of the left-most fraction. So the first numerator multiplied by the second denominator will be the top number in your final answer.


, The only way to get good is to practice:

It is equal to the percentage of positives among all tested persons with the disease or characteristic of interest. For this example, suppose the test has a sensitivity of 95%, or 0.95.;
, For our example, we have 1-0.95 = 0.05.

, For our example, we have 0.05 x 0.95 = 0.0475.

, Suppose 30 positive cases were in the data set. For our example, we have 0.0475/30 = 0.001583.

, In our example, it would be sqrt(0.001583) = 0.03979, or approximately 0.04 or 4%. This is the standard error of the sensitivity.

, For our example, we have 0.04 x 1.96 = 0.08. (Note that 1.96 is the normal distribution value for 95% confidence interval found in statistical tables. The corresponding normal distribution value for a more stringent 99% confidence interval is 2.58, and for a less stringent 90% confidence interval is 1.64.)

, In this example, the confidence interval ranges from 0.95-0.08 to 0.95+0.08, or 0.87 to 1.03.

Choose your approach.,
Develop your framework.,
Get to know your data.,
Choose your technology.,
Code and recode.,
Explore and share results.",How to Analyze Qualitative Data," Hopefully, you chose your analytical plan when you were deciding on your methodology and well before starting data collection. You should have planned how you were going to analyze your data, how that would influence your methods, what data you would collect and how. See for an overview of choosing a qualitative research methodology. However, sometimes people change their approach in response to the data collection process.


There are dozens of different approaches, and different disciplines use different terminology to describe what often appear to be the same technique. However, everyone’s approach is a little different, so read more about some of these broad types, and choose a technique or combination that is right for your research.
Here are a few possibilities:


Thematic / content analysis Generating ‘codes’ that describe themes in the text, such as ‘Anxiety’ or ‘Eating habits’.

Discourse analysis Looking at the data in the context of a wider discourse, such as political, historical trends or a group setting.

Narrative Analysis (Phenomenology) How people describe their own stories, using language, time and metaphor.

Semiotic analysis (Hermeneutics) How participants (or the researcher) understand and interpret the world by their nuanced use of language and words.

;
, There are two main approaches to choose from here:



Grounded theory / emergent coding / inductive (data driven) This is where you don’t know beforehand what you are looking for in the data, and identify topics as you are reading it: you are creating theory on the fly.

Framework analysis / structured / (theory driven) Essentially where you use pre-exiting theory and your research questions to set out topics you look for before you start the coding process.

,


Qualitative analysis is often an iterative approach, but it really helps to sit down with your data after you have collected it and read it all through before actually starting any analysis. Time constraints can make this feel difficult, but otherwise you may end up having to go back through your data because you noticed an important theme you hadn’t coded in the first few sources.
If you’ve transcribed the data yourself (for example from recorded interviews) this really helps you be close to the data, but even if you had someone else do the transcription, read it through to check for misheard words.

, This will also depend on the format of your data, especially if it includes multimedia sources like audio, video or pictures.


Many people choose to use paper copies of their data, colored highlighters or markers to highlight parts of the data about particular themes. You can also use sticky notes, or cut out sections of data, and stick them onto charts on in files keeping all your relevant sections together.
You may also choose to take one large sheet of paper (OSOP) and use this to explore and manage your themes.
Dedicated software for qualitative analysis can help manage, code and explore connections in coded data, but can’t do coding for you. An independent overview of the different packages can be found at the CAQDAS Networking Project. However, many people choose to use standard spreadsheet or word processing software to help manage their data.

, Now you should be ready to go through your data, source by source, line by line, and reduce it into meaningful codes. You should expect this to take some time, for example, as much as 1-4 hours for every hour of collected and transcribed interviews.


Especially when using emergent coding, you may go through once and do very obvious ‘low-level’ coding, identifying things like ‘doctor’ and ‘treatment’. Then you could go through again, having broken down all the data into these codes and identify ‘higher-level’ codes, which with your research questions such as ‘fear of hospitals’ or ‘poor communication’.

, Even before you have finished your coding, you might want to stop and examine the process. What themes are coming up a lot? What connections and trends are being shown in the coding? What is missing? Once you have finished, you will want to share your findings with others. That's a topic in itself, but you can share quotes, images, but mostly write from your experience with analyzing, what important factors you have discovered in the data.

Convert the whole number to a fraction.,
Find the reciprocal of the divisor.,
Multiply the two fractions.,
Simplify, if necessary.",How to Divide a Whole Number With a Fraction1," To do this, make the whole number the numerator of a fraction. Make the denominator 1.For example, if you are calculating 7÷34{\displaystyle 7\div {\frac {3}{4}}}, you would first change 7{\displaystyle 7} to 71{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{1}}}.
;
, The reciprocal of a number is the inverse of the number. To find the reciprocal of a fraction, reverse the numerator and denominator.For example, the inverse of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} is 43{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{3}}}.


, To multiply fractions, first multiply the numerators together. Then, multiply the denominators together. The product of the two fractions equals the quotient of your original division problem.For example, 71×43=283{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{1}}\times {\frac {4}{3}}={\frac {28}{3}}}


, If you have an improper fraction (a fraction with a larger numerator than denominator), your teacher may require you to  change it to a mixed number. Usually your teacher will require you to  reduce proper fractions to lowest terms.

For example, 283{\displaystyle {\frac {28}{3}}} simplified to a mixed number is 713{\displaystyle 7{\frac {1}{3}}}.

Draw shapes representing the whole number.,
Divide each whole shape according to the fraction’s denominator.,
Shade in groups representing the fraction.,
Count the number of whole groups.,
Interpret leftover pieces.,
Write the answer.",How to Divide a Whole Number With a Fraction2," Your shape should be one capable of dividing into equal groups, such as a square or circle. Draw the shapes large enough that you can divide them into smaller pieces.

For example, if you are calculating 5÷34{\displaystyle 5\div {\frac {3}{4}}}, you would draw 5 circles.


, The denominator of a fraction tells you how many pieces a whole is divided into. Divide each whole shape into its fractional parts.For example, if you are dividing by 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, the 4 in the denominator tells you to divide each whole shape into fourths. 


, Since you are dividing the whole number by the fraction, you are looking to see how many groups of the fraction are in the whole number.So, first, you need to create your groups. It might be helpful to shade each group a different color, since some groups will have pieces in two different wholes. Leave any leftover pieces unshaded.

For example, if you are dividing 5 by 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, you would color 3 quarters a different color for each group. Note that many groups will contain 2 quarters in one whole, and 1 quarter in another whole.


, This will give you the whole number of your answer.

For example, you should have created 6 groups of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} among your 5 circles.


, Compare the number of pieces you have left over to a complete group. The fraction of a group that you have left over will indicate the fraction of your answer. Make sure you do not compare the number of pieces you have to a whole shape, as this will give you the wrong fraction.

For example, after dividing the 5 shapes into groups of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, you have 2 quarters, or 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} left. Since a whole group is 3 pieces, and you have 2 pieces, your fraction is 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}}. 


, Combine your whole number of groups with your fractional number of groups to find the quotient of your original division problem.

For example, 5÷34=623{\displaystyle 5\div {\frac {3}{4}}=6{\frac {2}{3}}}.

Solve this math problem: How many times does 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} go into 8{\displaystyle 8}?,
Solve the following problem: 16÷58{\displaystyle 16\div {\frac {5}{8}}}.,
Solve the following problem by drawing a diagram.",How to Divide a Whole Number With a Fraction3,"

Since the problem is asking how many groups of 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} are in 8, the problem is one of division.

Turn 8 into a fraction by placing it over 1: 8=81{\displaystyle 8={\frac {8}{1}}}.

Find the reciprocal of the fraction by reversing the numerator and denominator: 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} becomes 21{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{1}}}.

Multiply the two fractions together: 81×21=161{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{1}}\times {\frac {2}{1}}={\frac {16}{1}}}.

Simplify, if necessary: 161=16{\displaystyle {\frac {16}{1}}=16}.


,

Convert 16 into a fraction by placing it over 1: 16=161{\displaystyle 16={\frac {16}{1}}}.

Take the fraction’s reciprocal by reversing the numerator and denominator: 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} becomes 85{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}}.

Multiply the two fractions together: 161×85=1285{\displaystyle {\frac {16}{1}}\times {\frac {8}{5}}={\frac {128}{5}}}.

Simplify, if necessary: 1285=2535{\displaystyle {\frac {128}{5}}=25{\frac {3}{5}}}.


, Rufus has 9 cans of food. She eats 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}} of a can every day. How many days will her food last?

Draw 9 circles representing the 9 cans.

Since she eats 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}} at a time, divide each circle into thirds.

Color groups of 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}}.

Count the number of complete groups. There should be 13.

Interpret the leftover pieces. There is 1 piece leftover, which is 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}}. Since a whole group is 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}}, you have half a group left over. So, your fraction is 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.

Combine the number of whole groups and fractional groups to find your final answer: 9÷23=1312{\displaystyle 9\div {\frac {2}{3}}=13{\frac {1}{2}}}.

Solve for x.,
Reduce the fraction.,
Determine the repeating digits.,
Write the problem as an equation and subtract the repeating decimals.,
Solve for x.,
Remove the decimal in the numerator.",How to Convert Repeating Decimals to Fractions," For instance, the number 0.4444 has a repeating decimal of 4. It is a basic repeating decimal in the sense that there's no non-repeating portion to the decimal number. Count how many repeating digits there are in the pattern.


Once your equation is written, you will multiply it by 10^y, where y equals the number of repeating digits in the pattern.In the example of 0.4444, there is one digit that repeats, so you will multiply the equation by 10^1.
For a repeating decimal of 0.4545, there are two digits that repeat, and you would, therefore, multiply your equation by 10^2.
For three repeating digits, multiply by 10^3, etc.;
, Write it out so that x equals the original number. In this instance, the equation is x = 0.4444. Since there’s only one digit in the repeating decimal, multiply the equation by 10^1 (which equals 10).In the example where x = 0.4444, then 10x = 4.4444.
With the example x = 0.4545, there are two repeating digits, so you multiply both sides of the equation by 10^2 (which equals 100), giving you 100x = 45.4545.

, You accomplish this by subtracting x from 10x. Remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation must be done to the other, so:10x – 1x = 4.4444 – 0.4444
On the left side, you have10x - 1x = 9x. On the right side, you have 4.4444 – 0.4444 = 4
Therefore, 9x = 4

, Once you know what 9x equals, you can determine what x equals by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:


On the left side of the equation you have 9x ÷ 9 = x. On the right side of the equation you have 4/9

Therefore, x = 4/9, and the repeating decimal 0.4444 can be written as the fraction 4/9.

, Put the fraction in its simplest form (if applicable) by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor.In the example of 4/9, that is the simplest form.

, It’s not uncommon for a number to have non-repeating digits before the repeating decimal, but these can still be converted into fractions.


For example, take the number 6.215151. Here, 6.2 is non-repeating, and the repeating digits are 15.
Again take note of how many repeating digits there are in the pattern, because you will multiply by 10^y based on that number.
In this example, there are two repeating digits, so you will multiply your equation by 10^2.

, Again, if x = 6.215151, then 100x = 621.5151. To remove the repeating decimals, subtract from both sides of the equation:



100x – x (= 99x) = 621.5151 - 6.215151 (= 615.3)
Therefore, 99x = 615.3

, Since 99x = 615.3, divide both sides of the equation by 99. This gives you x = 615.3/99.

, Do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10^z, where z equals the number of decimal places you must move to eliminate the decimal. In 615.3, you have to move the decimal by one place, meaning you multiply the numerator and denominator by 10^1:



615.3 x 10 / 99 x 10 = 6153/990

Reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest common factor, which in this case is 3, giving you x = 2,051/ 330

Use a calculator to divide the numerator by the denominator.,
Multiply the decimal by 100.,
Add a percent sign.",How to Convert an Improper Fraction to Percent1," The numerator is the top number, and the denominator is the bottom number. It is best to use a calculator, because depending on the fraction, you might end up with a number that has many decimal places. Completing this calculation converts the fraction to a decimal.

Note that, because you have an improper fraction, the denominator will divide into the numerator at least 1 whole time. That means that your decimal will be greater than 1. It also means that your percent will be greater than 100%.

For example, if you are converting 138{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{8}}}, you would calculate 13÷8=1.625{\displaystyle 13\div 8=1.625}. 
;
, You can do this with a calculator, but an easy way to do this in your head is to simply move the decimal point two places to the right.For example, 1.625×100=162.5{\displaystyle 1.625\times 100=162.5}.


, Until you add a percent sign, your number still reads like a decimal, even though it no longer is. So, add your percent sign to avoid confusion. The percent sign comes after the number.

For example, 162.5%{\displaystyle 162.5\%}.

Multiply the fraction by 100.,
Divide the numerator by the denominator.,
Add a percent sign.",How to Convert an Improper Fraction to Percent2," To multiply a fraction by 100, multiply the numerator by 100. Keep the same denominator.You can also think of multiplying the fraction by 1001{\displaystyle {\frac {100}{1}}}. Note that 100÷1=100{\displaystyle 100\div 1=100}, so 1001=100{\displaystyle {\frac {100}{1}}=100}. It doesn’t matter if you multiply by the whole number or the fraction, since they mean the same thing.

For example:1310×100{\displaystyle {\frac {13}{10}}\times 100}13×10010{\displaystyle {\frac {13\times 100}{10}}}130010{\displaystyle {\frac {1300}{10}}}


, The numerator is the top number, the denominator is the bottom number. You will likely need a calculator to do this, or you can do it manually.

For example, 1300÷10=130{\displaystyle 1300\div 10=130}.


, The percent sign goes after the number, and helps avoid confusion. Remember that a percent is not the same thing as a decimal or whole number, so you need to denote a percent with the appropriate sign.

For example, 130%{\displaystyle 130\%}


"
"
Understand what a percent looks like as a fraction.,
Divide 100 by the denominator of the fraction.,
Multiply the numerator and denominator by the factor of change.,
State the fraction as a percent.",How to Convert an Improper Fraction to Percent3," Since a percent is equal to a certain number of hundredths, you are going to convert the fraction to an equivalent one with 100 in the denominator.

For example, if you have 85{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}}, you want to find x{\displaystyle x} in the equation 85=x100{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}={\frac {x}{100}}}.


, Remember that the denominator is the bottom number. This calculation will give you a factor of change telling you how much bigger 100 is than the denominator. Note that this method only works if the denominator divides evenly into 100.

For example, if you are converting 85{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}}, you would calculate 100÷5=20{\displaystyle 100\div 5=20}. So, a denominator of 100 is 20 times bigger than a denominator of 5.


, To maintain an equivalent fraction, whatever you do to the original denominator, you must also do the the numerator. For example, 85=8×205×20=160100{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{5}}={\frac {8\times 20}{5\times 20}}={\frac {160}{100}}}.


, Remember that a percent is simply a number out of 100, or hundredths. Since your fraction is now shown as x100{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{100}}}, the numerator of your fraction is now the percent. Note that, since you are working with an improper fraction, your numerator is larger than your denominator. This means that your fraction represents more than 100 percent.

Don’t forget to include the percent sign after the number.

For example, 160100=160%{\displaystyle {\frac {160}{100}}=160\%}

Know the difference between average and median.,

Try using an average calculator.",How to Calculate Average Age," Figuring out the average of something is simple. It means that you take every single number in the list. Write them down or put them in a spreadsheet., That means that you add them all up for a grand total. Let’s say you have 5 ages: 31, 30, 26, 21, 10. The total or sum of those numbers is 118., That’s the average. Using the above example, you would divide 118 (the sum of all the ages) by 5 (the number of ages in the list). The average age is 23.6.


This works for much larger number sets too. For example, let’s say you wanted to find the average age of people in a club. Let’s say there were 100 members in the club. You would need the exact ages of each club member. You would add those ages together to get a sum. Then, you would divide that sum by the number 100. That’s the average age of members in the club.

, It’s no different when calculating average for other types of numbers that aren't ages. Average works the same way.


For example, let’s say you want to know the average population of the 10 largest cities in America. You would list the population for each city. Then, you would add all of those numbers up. You would divide the sum by 10, and that’s the average.
There are times you might want to use a weighted average. For example, when averaging a student’s grades, you might want to weigh some assignments as being worth more than others.To do this, multiply each grade by the weight. Then add those numbers together, and divide by the total number of grades , Sometimes people are confused by the difference between the average and the median of a set of numbers. There are times that the median can be a better number to use than the average, actually.


The median means the mid-point number in the data. It means the number (in this case age) that appears exactly in the middle..
Median might be a better assessment of the group’s age if there is an outlier in the group. Let’s say every student in a college class of 20 is between the ages of 18-25, but there is a single older returning student who is 80. If you calculated the average, the much older student would skew the average upward making the class look older than it really is. If you selected the number at the midpoint of all the ages on a list, it would be a closer representation of the class. So, use median if there is an extreme outlier on your list.

, Mode is different; that means the number that appears most frequently in the data.


Mean is the same thing as average. It’s just another word used for it. Sometimes the best way to handle numbers is simply to present more than one number, say both median and average.
If you’re asked to find the average age but only have age ranges (such as a certain number of people in age range 2-4 and age range 4-6, you would calculate the midpoint number for each range, add those up, and then divide them by the total number in each age range.), If you need to calculate the average from a lengthy list of ages, try putting them into Excel. Otherwise, if you sit there with a calculator or notepad and paper, it could take you a long time.


Let’s say for the sake of argument that you needed to calculate the average age of every student in a school or of every person on the payroll of a large company. Those are examples of lists where there would be so many ages that it would be beneficial to use a spreadsheet program like Excel.
The first thing you need to do is put the ages in an Excel spreadsheet. Excel is widely available through Microsoft Office package. Either you will need to type the ages into Excel or, better yet, you can import another document containing the ages into Excel. Perhaps the ages are already organized in Excel.
To import a text file into Excel, click on ""get external data"" and the text. Excel will walk you through a wizard to import that data into a spreadsheet, Let’s say the ages are listed in column A in Excel. Let’s say they start at row 1 and stop at row 200 (columns are vertical in Excel, and rows are horizontal). To get the average, you need to input the Excel formula for average. You can type it at the bottom of column A.


The formula for average in Excel is =(AVERAGE)A1:A200.You need to substitute the column and row coordinates that house the first age in the column for A1. In this example, it would literally be A1, if the first age was listed in the first row in column A. You would need to substitute A200 for the column and row coordinates that house the last age in column A in your own data set.
In this example, it was A200 because the last age is housed in column A, row 200. The colon in between tells the computer to add up the age in A1, in A200 and everything in between, and average them. Hit enter, and you should have the average.

, There are websites that will make it easier to calculate average. They provide online calculators in which you put the string of numbers.Of course, a pencil and paper or a regular calculator work too. Once you understand how the formula for average works, you can figure out which tool will get you there.

Determine whether or not the fractions have the same denominator.,
Find a common denominator.,
Change the numerators of the fractions.,
Compare the numerators of the fractions.",How to Compare Fractions," This is the first step to comparing fractions. The denominator is the number on the bottom of the fraction and the numerator is the number on top. For example, the fractions 5/7 and 9/13 do not have the same denominator, because 7 does not equal 13, so you'll have to take a few steps to compare them.If the denominator of the fractions is the same, then all you have to do is look at the numerator to know which fraction is greater. For example, with the fraction 5/12 and 7/12, you know that 7/12 is greater than 5/12 because 7 is greater than 5.;
, To be able to compare the fractions, you'll need to find a common denominator so you can figure out which fraction is greater. If you were adding and subtracting fractions with unlike denominators, then it would be best to find the least common denominator for the fractions. But since you're just comparing the fractions, you can just take a shortcut and multiply the denominators of both fractions to find the common denominator.


7 x 13 = 91, so the new denominator will be 91.

, Now that you've changed the denominators of the fractions to 91, you'll need to change the numerators so the value of the fractions remains the same. To do this, you'll need to multiply the numerator of each fraction by the same number that you multiplied the denominator by to get 91. Here's how you do it:


With the original fraction 5/7, you multiplied 7 by 13 to get a new denominator of 91, so you'll need to multiply 5 by 13 to get the new numerator. You're essentially multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by 13/13 (which equals 1). 5/7 x 13/13 = 65/91.
With the original fraction 9/13, you multiplied 13 by 7 to get a new denominator of 91, so you'll need to multiply 9 by 7 to get the new numerator. 9 x 7 = 63, so the new fraction is 63/91.

, The one with the larger numerator is the greater fraction. So, the fraction 65/91 is greater than 63/91 because 65 is greater than 63. This means that the original fraction, 5/7, is greater than 9/13.

Another way to think of a fraction is as a value that represents a portion of a whole.
For example, if there are eight apples and you take three of them, you have taken three of the eight, or three eights. Written in fraction form, the value would be presented as: 3/8

, Simply put, the numerator is the number on the top and the denominator is the number on the bottom.


When treated as a mathematical function rather than an expression, the numerator is divided by the denominator.
For example, with the fraction 5/9:

The number 5 is the numerator.
The number 9 is the denominator.



,


Example: 2/5
Every proper fraction expresses a value that is less than 1.
A proper fraction represents a partial portion of a whole. For example, if there are five books and you read two of them, you have read two out of five books, or two-fifths. Written numerically as a proper fraction, that would be: 2/5;
, For any improper fraction, the numerator is larger than the denominator.


Example: 5/4
Every improper fraction expresses a value that is greater than 1.
An improper fraction represents an amount that is greater than a whole. For example, if you were only supposed to sleep for eight hours but ended up sleeping for nine hours, you have slept for nine out of eight hours, or nine-eighth hours. Written numerically as an improper fraction, that would be: 9/8
Also note that an improper fraction can be expressed as a mixed number.

, With a whole fraction, the numerator and the denominator are equal.


Example: 3/3
Every improper fraction expresses a value equal to 1.
A whole fraction represents an amount that is exactly equal to a single whole. For example, if there are three pieces of candy and you eat all three pieces, you have eaten three out of three or three-thirds of the candy. Written numerically as a whole fraction, that would be: 3/3

In the same example, you could also write that you have eaten the whole amount, or one (1) serving.


Note that a whole fraction differs from a whole number. A whole number refers to all positive ""counting"" numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Whole numbers also include ""0"" but do not include negative numbers.,


Example: 1-1/2
Writing a value as a mixed number allows you to avoid the use of improper fractions. Like an improper fraction, a mixed number represents an amount that is greater than a whole. Unlike an improper fraction, however, a mixed number expresses the whole separately and identifies the remaining partial whole, as well.
For example, if you are supposed to sleep for eight hours and sleep for nine hours, instead, you have slept for nine out of eight hours. You could also express this by stating that you have slept a full whole, 1, as well as one hour of an additional eight hour cycle, or one out of eight (one-eighth). Written numerically as a mixed number, the value would be: 1-1/8

, In a pair or set of fractions, if the fractions all have the same denominator, they are said to be homogeneous.


Example: 1/7, 4/7, 9/7
These fractions represents values of a whole that are divided into the same portions. For example, if the serving size of one type of candy is seven pieces and the serving size of a second type is also seven pieces, both fractions would be represented in a homogeneous pair of sevenths.
Homogeneous fractions can be added and subtracted as they are written.

, Fractions within a pair or set that do not have the same denominator are classified as heterogeneous.


Example: 1/3, 2/5, 7/6
These fractions represent values of a whole when those wholes are divided into different portions. For example, if the serving size of one type of candy is three pieces and the serving size of a second type of candy is five pieces, those serving sizes will be represented as thirds and fifths, respectively.
Note that heterogeneous fractions cannot be added or subtracted as they are written. They must first be changed into homogeneous fractions.

, Equivalent fractions within a pair or set are those that have the same value when reduced to their simplest forms.


Example: 1/2, 2/4, 3/6, 4/8

If you simplified or reduced each number in the above example set, all four numbers would equal 1/2. Two is half of four (2/4), three is half of six (3/6), and four is half of eight (4/8), just as one is half of two (1/2).


You can check for equivalent pairs by cross-multiplying the fractions, as well. When you cross multiply fractions, you multiply the numerator of the first fraction with the denominator of the second, and the numerator of the second fraction with the denominator of the first. If the two products are equal, then the fractions in the pair are equivalent.

Example: 3/6 and 4/8
3 * 8 = 4 * 6
24 = 24



, Fractions should always be reduced or simplified to their smallest equivalent form. When a fraction is simplified as much as possible, it is then classified as irreducible.


Example: 4/7, 1/3
To determine if a fraction can be reduced further, divide both the numerator and denominator by the value of the numerator or by the greatest common factor between the numerator and denominator.
For the fraction 3/9

Divide both the numerator and denominator by the number 3.
(3/3) / (9/3) = 1 / 3
The irreducible form of the fraction is 1/3.


For the fraction 6/15

Divide both the numerator and denominator by 3.
(6/3) / (15/3) = 2 / 5
The irreducible form of the fraction is 2/5.



, As with integers, fractions can either be positive or negative. A negative fraction is represented by a negative sign (-) placed directly to the left of the number.


Example: -5/9
Other than the negative value, these fractions can be classified using the same sets of rules you would use when classifying individual fractions and fraction sets.

, From the following set, identify the proper fraction, improper fraction, whole fraction, and mixed number: 9/5, 3-1/4, 7/9, 3/3


The proper fraction is 7/9.
The improper fraction is 9/5.
The whole fraction is 3/3.
The mixed number is 3-1/4.

, From the following set, identify which pair is homogeneous, which is heterogeneous, and which is equivalent: 3/9, 1/3; 2/3, 4/3; 1/6, 2/5


The homogeneous pair is 2/3 and 4/3.
The heterogeneous pair is 1/6 and 2/5.
The equivalent pair is 3/9 and 1/3.

, From the following set, identify which fraction is irreducible and which fractions are reducible: 6/12, 3/9, 4/7, 4/2


The fraction 6/12 is not irreducible; it can be simplified to 1/2.
The fraction 3/9 is not irreducible; it can be simplified to 1/3.
The fraction 4/2 is not irreducible; it can be simplified to 2/1 or 2.
The fraction 4/7 is irreducible. It cannot be simplified any further than it already is.

, From the following set, identify which fraction is the negative fraction and which is the positive fraction: 1/2, -5/7


The number 1/2 is positive.
The number -5/7 is negative.

Divide the numerator by the denominator.,
Write the whole number answer.,
Make a fraction from the remainder and the original denominator.,
To get back to an improper fractions, add the whole number to the numerator.",How to Convert Improper Fractions Into Mixed Numbers1," Start by writing your improper fraction. Then, divide the numerator by the denominator — in other words, just do the division problem that the fraction is already set up for. Don't forget to include the remainder.


Let's follow along with an example. Let's say that we need to turn the fraction 7/5 into a mixed number. We'll start by dividing 7 by 5, like this:
7/5 → 7 ÷ 5 = 1 R2;
, The whole number part of your mixed number (the big number to the left of your fraction) is the whole number answer of your division problem. In other words, just write the answer of the division problem without the remainder.


In our example, since our answer is 1 R2, we would leave off the remainder and just write 1.


, Now, we need to find the fraction part of the mixed number. Put the remainder from your division problem in the numerator and use the same denominator from your original improper fraction. Put this fraction next to your whole number and you have your mixed number!


In our example, our remainder is 2. Putting this over our original denominator (5), we get 2/5. We put this next to our whole number answer (1) to get our final mixed number, like this:

1 2/5.

, Mixed numbers look good on paper and are easy to read, but they're not always the best choice. For example, if we're multiplying a fraction and a mixed number, our work will be a lot easier if we convert the mixed number back into an improper fraction. To do this, just multiply the whole number by the denominator and add it to the numerator.


If we wanted to convert our example answer (1 2/5) back to an improper fraction, we would do it like this:
1 × 5 = 5 → (2 + 5)/5 = 7/5

Learn the basic equation.,
Remember the order of operations.,
Multiply the whole number and the denominator.,
Add the numerator to the product.,
Rewrite the improper fraction with the new numerator.,
Check your work.,
Reduce the fraction to its simplest form if necessary.,
Remember the mixed number formula.,
Divide the improper fraction’s numerator by its denominator.,
Determine the remainder.",How to Change Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions," If a mixed number is a b/c then the equation used to convert it to an improper fraction is (ac+b)/c.In this equation:


A is the whole number.
B is the numerator (the top portion of the fraction).
C is the denominator (the bottom portion of the fraction).;
, BEDMAS or PEDMAS dictates that you must first address the numbers in parentheses. Since multiplication and division come first, you will first multiply ac. You will then add b, since that figure is also within parentheses. Finally, you will divide by c, or use c as the new denominator.


P/BEDMAS stands for parentheses/brackets, exponents, multiply or divide, and add or subtract.

, Take the mixed number 1 ⅔ for example: a = 1, b = 2, and c = 3. Multiply ac, which in this example is 3 x 1 = 3., You now know the product of ac = 3, so now it's time to add b = 2: 3 + 2 = 5.This sum, 5, is the new numerator of your improper fraction.

, Remember that the denominator (c = 3) remains the same from the original fraction, and the new numerator is 5. The improper fraction converted from the original mixed number, therefore, is 5/3.

, To be certain, you can always double check your math by running the numbers again, or verifying the answer using an online calculator.

, The simplest form is the smallest and easiest way to represent a fraction. To reduce a fraction to its simplest form, determine if the numerator and denominator have common factors. If they do, select the highest one and divide the numerator and denominator by that number.For instance, in the fraction 9/42, the greatest common factor is 3.
Divide both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor to get the fraction's simplest form: 9 ÷ 3 / 42 ÷ 3 = 3/14


, Just as you can convert a mixed number into an improper fraction, so too can you convert going the other way. Like before, use the formula a b/c for your mixed number. The denominator from your improper fraction will be the same denominator in your mixed number.


For instance, when converting the improper fraction 7/5 into a mixed number, c = 5.

, Use long division or a simple calculation to determine how many times the denominator will fully go into the numerator (don't worry about any decimals). That number will be the mixed number’s whole number (the a value).


Dividing 7/5 gives you 1.4, where a = 1.

, The remainder is your new numerator. When you divide 7/5 you get 1 with a remainder of 2, where b = 2. You now have all the components of your mixed number: the improper fraction 7/5 gives you the mixed number 1 ⅖."

Convert 11/4 to a mixed number.,
Convert 99/5 to a mixed number.,
Convert 6/6 to a mixed number.,
Convert 18/6 to a mixed number.,
Convert -10/3 to a mixed number.",How to Convert Improper Fractions Into Mixed Numbers2," This problem is easy — just solve exactly as above. See below for a step-by-step solution.


11/4 — to start, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator.
11 ÷ 4 = 2 R 3 — now, we need to make a fraction from the remainder and our original denominator.
11/4 = 2 3/4


, We're dealing with a really big numerator here, but don't be intimidated — the process is exactly the same! See below:


99/5 — how many times does 5 go into 99? Since 5 goes into 100 exactly 20 times, it's safe to say that 5 goes into 99 19 times.
99 ÷ 5 = 19 R 4 — now, we just put the mixed number together like before.
99/5 = 19 4/5


, Up until now, we've only dealt with improper fractions where the numerator is bigger than the denominator. But what happens when they're the same number? See below to find out.


6/6 — six goes into six one time with no remainder, obviously.
6 ÷ 6 = 1 R0. Since a fraction with 0 in the numerator is always equal to zero, we don't need to put a fraction next to our whole number.
6/6 = 1


, If the numerator is a multiple of the denominator, you don't have to bother with the remainder — just do the division problem to get your answer. See below.


18/6 — since we know that 18 is just 6 × 3, we know we'll have a remainder of 0, so we don't need to worry about the fraction part of our mixed number.
18/6 = 3


, Negatives work exactly the same way as positive numbers do. See below:


-10/3
-10 ÷ 3 = -3 R1
-10/3 = -3 1/3

Rewrite the complex fraction as a division problem.,
Take the reciprocal of the second fraction.,
Rewrite the expression as a single fraction.,
Simplify the expression.,
Complete the necessary multiplications.",How to Divide a Fractional Algebraic Expression by a Fractional Algebraic Expression (Using the Fractional Bar Form)1," Remember that a fraction bar means “divided by,” so when you see a fraction over a fraction, you need to divide the top fraction by the bottom fraction.For example, you might see 2x2y−3x4{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}{\frac {x}{4}}}}. You can rewrite this as 2x2y−3÷x4{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\div {\frac {x}{4}}}.
;
, To  divide a fraction by a fraction, you take the reciprocal of the second fraction, and you change the division sign to a multiplication sign. A reciprocal is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are reversed.For example:2x2y−3÷x4{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\div {\frac {x}{4}}}becomes2x2y−3×4x{\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\times {\frac {4}{x}}}


, Use parentheses to show the multiplication, but do not multiply any terms yet. Writing the expression this way may help you identify terms that can cancel.

For example,2x2y−3×4x=4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\times {\frac {4}{x}}={\frac {4(2x^{2})}{x(y-3)}}}.


, Use the normal rules for  simplifying a rational expression to do this. Cancel out terms common to the numerator and denominator.Remember that you cannot cancel out a single term (like y{\displaystyle y}) from a binomial (like y−3{\displaystyle y-3}). 

Also remember that if you have an x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} term in the numerator, and an x{\displaystyle x} term in the denominator, you can cancel out one x{\displaystyle x}, and the x{\displaystyle x} in the denominator disappears, and the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} in the numerator becomes x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, you can cancel an x{\displaystyle x} in the numerator and denominator in the expression 4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x^{2})}{x(y-3)}}}:4(2x2)x(y−3){\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x^{\cancel {2}})}{{\cancel {x}}(y-3)}}}4(2x)y−3{\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}}


, If you have any remaining parentheses in the numerator or denominator, simplify these by multiplying. The result will be your final simplified expression.

For example, 4(2x)y−3=8xy−3{\displaystyle {\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}={\frac {8x}{y-3}}}. So, 2x2y−3x4=4(2x)y−3=8xy−3{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}{\frac {x}{4}}}={\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}={\frac {8x}{y-3}}}.

Use the FOIL method to multiply binomials.,
Use the distributive property.,
Turn whole numbers into fractions.",How to Divide a Fractional Algebraic Expression by a Fractional Algebraic Expression (Using the Fractional Bar Form)2," The  FOIL method helps you remember to first multiply the first terms, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, then the last terms. When dividing a fraction by a fraction, this should be your last step after cancelling terms in the numerator and denominator.For example, if you are simplifying the expression y(x+3)4yx−2{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {y(x+3)}{4}}{\frac {y}{x-2}}}}, after taking the reciprocal and combining terms, you end up with the expression y(x+3)(x−2)4y{\displaystyle {\frac {y(x+3)(x-2)}{4y}}}. First, cancel the y{\displaystyle y} in the numerator and denominator, then multiply the binomials using the FOIL method:y(x+3)(x−2)4y{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {y}}(x+3)(x-2)}{4{\cancel {y}}}}}(x+3)(x−2)4{\displaystyle {\frac {(x+3)(x-2)}{4}}}x2−2x+3x−64{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}-2x+3x-6}{4}}}x2+x−64{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}+x-6}{4}}}


, You can use the distributive property to factor out a term. This might help you cancel terms. Conversely, you can use the distributive property to multiply a term into a binomial when you are simplifying your expressionFor example, if you are simplifying the expression 2x+4y2yx{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2x+4}{y}}{\frac {2y}{x}}}}, after taking the reciprocal and combining terms, you end up with the expression x(2x+4)2y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {x(2x+4)}{2y(y)}}}. First, factor out a 2 from 2x+4{\displaystyle 2x+4}. Then you can cancel a 2 from the numerator and denominator. Then, simplify the expression by completing the multiplication:(x)(2)(x+2)2y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {(x)(2)(x+2)}{2y(y)}}}(x)(2)(x+2)2y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {(x){\cancel {(2)}}(x+2)}{{\cancel {2}}y(y)}}}(x)(x+2)y(y){\displaystyle {\frac {(x)(x+2)}{y(y)}}}(x2+2x)y2{\displaystyle {\frac {(x^{2}+2x)}{y^{2}}}}


, You will need to do this if the numerator or denominator of the complex fraction contains a whole number being added or subtracted to a fraction. Remember that to add or subtract fractions, the fractions need to have the same denominator. So, to turn a whole number in the top or bottom of a complex fraction into a fraction, multiply it by xx{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{x}}}, where x{\displaystyle x} is the denominator of the fraction it is being added to or subtracted from.For example, if you have 2+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {2+{\frac {3}{y}}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}, you would change the 2 into a fraction by multiplying it by yy{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{y}}}:2+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {2+{\frac {3}{y}}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}2yy+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\frac {2y}{y}}+{\frac {3}{y}}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}2y+3y5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {2y+3}{y}}{\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}}2y+3y÷5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {2y+3}{y}}\div {\frac {5}{y^{2}}}}2y+3y×y25{\displaystyle {\frac {2y+3}{y}}\times {\frac {y^{2}}{5}}}y2(2y+3)5y{\displaystyle {\frac {y^{2}(2y+3)}{5y}}}y2(2y+3)5y{\displaystyle {\frac {y^{\cancel {2}}(2y+3)}{5{\cancel {y}}}}}y(2y+3)5{\displaystyle {\frac {y(2y+3)}{5}}}2y2+3y5{\displaystyle {\frac {2y^{2}+3y}{5}}}

Understand current liabilities.,
Understand current assets.,
Know your basic formula.,
Calculate current assets.,
Calculate total liabilities.,
Determine current liabilities.,
Find the current ratio.",How to Calculate Current Ratio," The term “current liabilities” is used frequently in accounting to refer to business obligations that must be paid in cash within a year or within the operating cycle of a company. These obligations will be settled either by current assets or by the creation of new current liabilities.


Examples of current liabilities include short-term loans, accounts payable, debts to suppliers, and accrued liabilities.;
, The term “current assets” refers to assets that are used to pay a company’s obligations and liabilities within a year. Current assets can also be converted into cash.


Examples of current assets include accounts receivable, stock inventory, marketable securities, and other liquid assets.

, The formula for calculating current ratio is a simple one: current assets divided by current liabilities. All the numbers you’ll need should appear on a company’s balance sheet.

, In order to calculate a current ratio, you’ll first need to find the company’s current assets. To do so, subtract non-current assets from the company’s total assets.


To illustrate, let’s say you are calculating the current ratio of a company with $120,000 in total assets, $55,000 in equity, $28,000 in non-current assets, and $26,000 in non-current liabilities. To calculate current assets, subtract non-current assets from total assets: $120,000 - $28,000 = $92,000.

, After calculating the company’s current assets, you’ll need to find its total liabilities. To do so, subtract total equity from the company’s total assets.


In the example above, to calculate the company’s total liabilities, subtract equity from total assets: $120,000 - $55,000 = $65,000.

, Once you’ve found the company’s total liabilities, you are ready to calculate its current liabilities. To do so, subtract the non-current liabilities from the company’s total liabilities.


In the example above, to calculate the company’s current liabilities, subtract non-current liabilities from total liabilities: $65,000 - $26,000 = $39,000.

, After determining current assets and current liabilities, plug your answers into the basic current ratio formula of current assets divided by current liabilities.


In the example above, divide the company’s current assets by its current liabilities: $92,000 / $39,000 = 2.358. Your company’s current ratio is 2.358, which is a satisfactory indicator of a financially healthy business.

Place them an inch or so apart on a line. Connect them with an arch, so that you know that those two multiply together to make 14.


Move inward, making a factor rainbow by making an arch with each set of factors.
Divide by 2 next, which divides evenly because 2 multiplies by 7 to equal 14. Therefore, the next two factors are 2 and 7. Connect those with an arch.
However, 3 does not divide into 14 evenly, and neither does 4 or 5. At this point, you've reached the middle of the factor rainbow, so the factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14.

,


The next two are 2 and 14. Three does not divide evenly into 28. However, 4 does, so the next factors are 4 and 7. Neither 5 nor 6 divide evenly into 28, so you've reached the end of your factor rainbow for 28. Your factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28.

, The greatest common factor is the largest factor that both numbers share. For instance, in the two sets of factors you just found, 14 is shared between both sets, so it is the greatest common factor."

Eighteen is divisible by 2, but 63 is not. You need to move to the next prime, 3. Both 18 and 63 are divisible by 3. Divide 3 into both numbers; 18 divided by 3 is 6, while 63 divided by 3 is 21. Therefore, your new fraction 6/21., Often, with this method, you'll need to simplify the fraction some more. Because 6/21 does not seem simplified, try dividing into it again. Both numbers are divisible by the same factor, 3. Six divided by 3 is 2, while 21 divided by 3 is 7. Your new fraction is 2/7., The factors of 2 are just 1 and 2. The factors of 7 are 1 and 7. Therefore, the numbers do not share any more common factors., You used the factors 3 and 3. Multiply them together to get the greatest common factor for the original fraction, 9. Now, check your answer by multiplying each number in your final fraction by 9. Two times 9 is 18, while 7 times 9 is 63, making the fraction 18/63. Your answer checks out.

Know the terms.,
Rewrite your fraction.,
Solve your problem.,
Solve fractions with remainders.,
Solve a fraction with a repeating decimal.,
Change a complicated fraction.,
Solve an irregular fraction.,
Convert a compound fraction.",How to Change a Fraction to a Decimal1," Each number in a fraction has a name. The top number in a fraction is called a numerator. The bottom number is called a denominator. A fraction expresses the idea of the numerator divided by the denominator. For example, the fraction three fourths is written as 3/4. It means that 3 is being divided by 4. You can use this idea to change fractions into decimals., The first thing you need to do to change a decimal into a fraction is to rewrite the fraction as a workable math problem. For example, you have the simple fraction 1/2. This means 1 divided by 2. You need to rewrite your problem as follows: 1 ÷ 2 = x., You need to solve for x in your problem to change the fraction into a decimal. For 1/2, 2 does not go into 1 any times. You must add a zero behind the decimal place to divide the larger number, 2, into the smaller number, 1. Your problem is now: 1.0 ÷ 2 = x. You know that 2 multiplied by 5 is 10, but you have to remember your decimal. So 1.0 ÷ 2 = 0.5.If you have a fraction that is a number over itself, such as 2/2, 4/4, or 7/7, the answer will always be 1. The rewritten problem would be 7 ÷ 7 = x and 7 divided by 7 is 1.

, There are simple fractions that have remainders once you divide them once. For example, to change 1/4 into a decimal, you rewrite it as: 1.0 ÷ 4 = x. If you divide 4 into 1.0, you get .2 with a remainder 2. If you have a remainder, you need to bring another zero after the decimal. You new problem would be: 1.00 ÷ 4 = x. You know that you have a remainder of 2. Add the extra zero behind the 2 and divide by 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5 with no remainder. 1/4 as a decimal is 0.25.


Always make sure you solve your division problem until there is no remainder.
Make sure you keep track of where your decimal needs to be. You don't want to get the wrong decimal because you have moved where your decimal point needs to be., Some fractions do not divide as nicely as others. When this happens, you will end up with a repeating decimal. This means that there is always a remainder and that the decimal number keeps repeating without end. For example, you need to change 1/3 into a decimal. The rewritten problem would be 1.0 ÷ 3 = x.


1.0 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. Bring in another 0. 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1, just like before. No matter how many 0s you bring in, the remainder will always be 1. This means that your decimal is 0.33333. The 3s will go on forever.
To write this as an answer, cut off the decimals to the amount of places needed for your assignment. You cal also write it as 0.3 with a straight line above the 3. This symbol indicates that the 3 repeats., There are some fractions considered more complicated than others because it takes more to divide them. 1/2, 1/4, and 3/4 are simple fractions. Other fractions are more complicated. For example, you need to convert 1/8 into a decimal. The rewritten equation is 1.00 ÷ 8 = x. 1.0 divided by 8 is .2 with a remainder of 2. 20 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 4. 40 divided by 8 is 5 with no remainder. Your decimal would be 0.125., Complicated fractions still have a definite decimal answer. There are some fractions that will always have a remainder. Unlike the repeating decimal, the decimal has no pattern. For example, you need to express 3/19 as a decimal. Rewrite the problem as 3.00 ÷ 19 = x.


3.0 divided by 19 is 1 with a remainder of 11. Add another 0. 110 divided by 19 is 5 with a remainder of 15. In this case, you need to keep adding 0s. 150 divide by 19 is 7 with a remainder of 17. 170 divide by 19 is 8 with a remainder of 18. 180 divide by 19 is 9 with a remainder of 9. You can keep going, but you will continue to have a remainder. If we cut it off here, our answer would be 0.15789.Make sure you write your decimals to as many places as you need them to be.

, You may have to change a compound fraction. A compound fraction is one with a whole number as well as a fraction. For example, you need to convert 3 3/4 into a decimal. It is not as complicated as it looks. The integer, which is the whole number that isn't the fraction, will always go before the decimal point. Solve the remaining fraction like normal.


For this problem, the rewritten problem is 3.00 ÷ 4 = x. 3.0 divide by 4 is .7 with a remainder of 2. 20 divide by 4 is 5 with no remainder. Your answer would be 3.75."

Understand your fraction.,
Divide your numbers.,
Write down your answer.",How to Change a Fraction to a Decimal2," The numerator is always divided by the denominator in a fraction. With that is mind, you can convert any fraction into a decimal with a calculator. Any calculator will work to change fractions into decimals.


More advanced scientific and graphic calculators have a fraction button on them. They can change fractions as well as add, subtract, multiply, and divide them by other fractions., To figure out a fraction as a decimal with a calculator, you need to divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, you have the fraction 8/15. Hit the number 8 key on your calculator. Hit the ÷ symbol. Then hit the 1 and then the 5 to make 15. Then hit =.One of the benefits of using a calculator is that you can do much harder fractions in much less time than by hand. For example, you need to change 9/17 into a decimal. Instead of having to write out each section of the division, you can just punch it into your calculator. You get an answer of 0.52941, though it does keep going.

, Once you solve 8/15 on the calculator, the answer you see is: ""0.5333333333333."" This is another case where you have a repeating decimal. You would write it as 0.53 with a line over the 3 to show that it repeats.


With a calculator, you can choose where to cut off your decimal much easier. For example, with 9/17, the numbers continued on after the 5 places written down. When you choose where to stop, always look at the number behind that number. You use that number to round up the last number in your decimal if necessary. Since the next number for 0.52941 is a 1, it stays that way it is. If it was a 5 or higher, the decimal would have rounded to 0.52942."
"
Understand the method.,
Find your base of 10.,
Multiply your fraction.,
Practice.",How to Change a Fraction to a Decimal3," You can use bases of 10 to find the decimal of a fraction. You find the nearest number that has a 1 with 0s behind it that your denominator can be multiplied into. Decimals have designated with places, such as tenths, hundredths, and thousandths. These numbers as denominators makes is possible to convert your fraction into a decimal.


This does not work on every fraction. The denominator of the fraction has to be able to divide into a base of 10, such as 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and so on., The first step is to find a base of 10 for your fraction. For example, you need to convert 4/5 into a decimal. The denominator is 5. You need to figure out the closest number to 5 that has 1 with 0s. The closest base 10 to 5 is 10., To get 10, you have to multiply 5 by 2. Whatever you do to the denominator, you have to do to the numerator. Multiply the numerator by 2. The fraction you get is 8/10. Since the first place after the decimal is the tenths place, 8/10, which is eight tenths, would be 0.8 as a decimal., You have to practice these to get better at them. The more complicated the denominator, the harder it is to find a base of 10 for it. For example, you need to change 5/16 into a decimal. Take the bases of 10 and start dividing 16 into them. 16 does not divide into 10, 100, or 1,000. It does divide into 10,000 625 times. Since you multiply the denominator by 625, you need to multiply the numerator as well. 5 x 625 is 3125. Your new fraction is 3125/10,000. This becomes 0.3125 as a decimal."

Understand the meaning of less than.,
Understand what equal to means.,
Learning about more than.",How to Compare Decimals1," To recognize less than ( < ) think about the point of the arrow pointing to the smaller number.


In the example 3 < 6, 3 is the smaller number so the arrow is pointing to it.
A silly way to think about it is thinking of the arrow as an alligator’s mouth. The alligator always eats the larger number!;
, Equal to ( = ) is the easiest symbol to understand! When numbers have the same amount as the other, equal to ( = ) sign is used between the numbers.


This includes whole numbers (4 = 4) as well as decimals (2.75 = 2.75).

, More than ( > ) is the opposite of less than ( < ) and the the wide end of the arrow is open to the larger number.


For example 680 > 45.
To go with the alligator analogy again, the alligator’s mouth is always ready to chomp the larger number.

Verify the fractions have the same denominator.,
Add the numerators.,
Place the numerators’ sum over the denominator.",How to Add and Simplify Fractions1," A denominator is the number below the fraction bar.If the fractions do not have the same denominator, you cannot use this method.

For example, if you are calculating 24+14{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}, you can note that both fractions have the same denominator: 4.
;
, A numerator is the number above the fraction bar. Add numerators the same way you would add integers.For example, the numerators of 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} and 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} are 2 and 1, so you would calculate 2+1=3{\displaystyle 2+1=3}. So, 3 is the numerator of your sum.


, Since both fractions you are adding have the same denominator, the denominator of their sum will also be the same.For example, the sum of 24+14{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {1}{4}}} will have a denominator of 4: 24+14=34{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {1}{4}}={\frac {3}{4}}}.

Balance the pen.,
Take the pen in your dominant hand.,
Rest the barrel on the bottom knuckle of your middle finger.,
Hold the pen toward the paper at a 40 to 55 degree angle.The angle is extremely important, since it moves the tines away from the feed and allows ink to flow.,
Keep the nib level with the paper.",How to Write with a Fountain Pen1," Depending on the size of your hand and the size of the pen, holding a fountain pen could cause weight and balance issues. Experiment with the cap posted (i.e. placing the cap on the back of the pen), and with the cap removed. The pen is usually more in balance when the cap is in place, but each person’s experience is different., Pinch the pen lightly between your thumb and index finger, then slide it towards the end of the index finger. Use the bottom of your hand, including your ring and pinky fingers, to anchor against the page. Do not press so firmly against the paper that free movement is restricted. Do not grab the pen towards the bottom. If the hand is placed too far towards the end, it can affect the proper writing angle and potential ink flow., This is similar to the positioning in which most people write. If the middle finger is guiding and squeezing more than being used as a resting point, adjust the pen’s rear closer to the V created where the thumb meets the hand.It may feel more comfortable to place the pen closer towards the end of your middle finger, past the knuckle.

, Poor ink flow is usually due to an improper angle.Keep in mind that each fountain pen requires a slightly different angle at which the tines and feed separate. You will learn to recognize this through practice.
Some nibs have been modified by technicians to accommodate angles ranging from 35 degrees to nearly 90 degrees.The feel will be different than that of a ball-point pen, which is designed to write from various angles, including vertical. A vertical fountain pen does not utilize the full width of the nib (the tip of the pen)., You don’t want the nib to rock side to side as you write. It’s possible for ink to flow from a variety of angles, but each pen has an optimal spot where the ink flows the best. Writing with a fountain pen can feel inconsistent if the nib is lifted or angled incorrectly off the paper."

Understand the thousandths place.",How to Compare Decimals2," Any number left of the decimal point is in a units place. For example 405 is in the units place in 405.20532.

, The number right next to the left of the decimal point is the ones place. For example the 2 in 2.3 is in the ones place.

, The number left of the ones is the tens place. For example the 5 in 52.04 is in the tens place.

, The number left of the tens place is the hundreds place. For example, the 6 in 601.34 is in the hundreds place.

, The first number to the right of the decimal point is in the tenths place. For example, the 4 in 2.45 is in the tenths place.


Any number to the right of a decimal has the “th” at the place name. (For example: tenth, hundredth, thousandth).

, The second number to the right of a decimal point is in the hundredths place. The 0 in 3.304 is in the hundredths place.

, The third number to the right of a decimal point is in the thousandths place. For example, the 8 in 1.308 is in the thousandths place.

Write out the decimals you’re comparing.,
Write Side-by-side.,
Compose Vertically.,
Know how to organize decimals in a table.",How to Compare Decimals3," After you’ve had some practice comparing decimals, this step will no longer be necessary, but writing out the decimals will force you to pay attention to the numbers. You can write the decimals you’re comparing out in one of several ways including both side by side, vertical, and table.

, If you’re most comfortable comparing numbers written side-by-side, write the decimals out this way. Most math problems dealing with inequalities are written this way. A side by side decimal comparison would be the following:


0.6 = 0.60
.34 > .10
502.50 < 599.22
2000.00 > .001

, You may find it easier to compare decimals by writing each decimal on top of the other, as you would if you were adding them. If you write the numbers vertically, write them so the decimal points line up vertically. , Make a grid, filling in each space with a digit or a decimal point, again making sure that the decimal points line up vertically."

Compare the numbers to the left of the decimal point.,
Compare the numbers to the right of the decimal point.",How to Compare Decimals4," For example, 57.01 is large than 46.99 because the whole number components of the decimals are the first place to check when comparing the values.


No matter how many digits are to the right of the decimal, if the value to the left of the decimal point for one number is larger than the value for another number with decimals, the first number is larger.Here is another example. Comparing 55.95 with 57.28, because 57 is larger than 55, 57.28 is larger than 55.95.
One more example: Comparing 42.349 with 47.32, because 47 is larger than 42, 47.32 is larger than 42.349.

, If the numbers to the left of the decimal point are the same, compare the digits to the right of the decimal point to see which decimal is the larger number.


When the number of digits is different, this can be tricky.
Comparing 12.57 and 12.75, because 75 is larger than 57, 12.75 is larger than 12.57. (You can also look at just the first digits after the decimal points; because 7 is larger than 5, you again see that 12.75 is larger than 12.57.)
Comparing 14.92 and 14.092, you can see that the second decimal has three digits after the decimal point. However, by looking at the first digits only, you see that 9 is larger than 0, so 14.92 is larger than 14.092. You can also write a zero after the “2” in 14.92 to make it 14.920; because 920 is larger than 92, again 14.92 is the larger number.

Place the sum of the numerators over the new denominator.",How to Add and Simplify Fractions2," A denominator is the number below the fraction bar.For example, if you are calculating 45+34{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}+{\frac {3}{4}}}, you can note that the fractions have different denominators: 5 and 4.


, A multiple is a number that another number equally divides into. You can also think of a multiple as the result of multiplying a number by a whole number. You are looking for the smallest multiple that the two denominators have in common.For example, the smallest denominator in 45+34{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}+{\frac {3}{4}}} is 4. The first several multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. The smallest of these multiples that 5 shares with 4 is 20. So, 20 is the least common multiple of the two denominators.


, The result will give you a factor of change. This factor tells you how much bigger the common multiple is than the denominator.

For example, if the least common multiple is 20, and the first fraction’s denominator is 5, you would calculate 205=4{\displaystyle {\frac {20}{5}}=4}. That means 4 is the factor of change. The least common multiple is 4 times larger than the denominator.


, Doing this will keep the numerator and denominator of the equivalent fraction in proportion.For example, if the factor of change is 4, and the first fraction’s numerator is 4, you would calculate 4×4=16{\displaystyle 4\times 4=16}.


, The numerator will be the product of the factor of change and the original fraction’s numerator. The denominator will be the least common multiple.

For example, 45=1620{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}={\frac {16}{20}}}.


, The result will give you a factor of change for the second fraction. This factor tells you how much bigger the common multiple is than the denominator.

For example, if the least common multiple is 20, and the second fraction’s denominator is 4, you would calculate 204=5{\displaystyle {\frac {20}{4}}=5}. That means 5 is the factor of change for the second fraction.


, This will give you the numerator of your equivalent fraction.

For example, if the factor of change is 5, and the second fraction’s numerator is 3, you would calculate 5×3=15{\displaystyle 5\times 3=15}.


, The numerator will be the product of the factor of change and the original fraction’s numerator. The denominator will be the least common multiple.

For example, 34=1520{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}={\frac {15}{20}}}.


, Since the equivalent fractions have the same denominator, you can add the numerators as you normally would. For example, 16+15=31{\displaystyle 16+15=31}.


, Make sure you use the common denominator of the equivalent fractions. For example, 1620+1520=3120{\displaystyle {\frac {16}{20}}+{\frac {15}{20}}={\frac {31}{20}}}.

"
Factor the numerator.,
Factor the denominator.,
Cancel the factors common to the numerator and denominator.,
Rewrite the fraction with the remaining factors.",How to Add and Simplify Fractions3," You want to  factor the numerator into all of its prime factors. Remember that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. Rewrite the fraction showing this prime factorization in the numerator.

For example, if simplifying the fraction 2490{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{90}}}, you would calculate that 24=2×2×2×3{\displaystyle 24=2\times 2\times 2\times 3}. So, rewrite the fraction as 2×2×2×390{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2\times 2\times 3}{90}}}


, You also want to factor the denominator into its prime factors. Rewrite the fraction showing its prime factorization in the denominator.For example, if simplifying the fraction 2490{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{90}}}, you would calculate that 90=2×3×3×5{\displaystyle 90=2\times 3\times 3\times 5}. So, rewrite the fraction as 2×2×2×32×3×3×5{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2\times 2\times 3}{2\times 3\times 3\times 5}}}.


, Remember that when a factor is common to the top and bottom of a fraction, it cancels to 11{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1}}}. This means you can eliminate these factors, since any number multiplied by 1 is itself.For example, you can cancel out a 2 and a 3 in the numerator and denominator: 2×2×2×32×3×3×5{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2\times }}2\times 2{\cancel {\times 3}}}{{\cancel {2\times }}{\cancel {3\times }}3\times 5}}}. 


, You want to simplify the fraction so that it only includes the factors that did not cancel. If more than one factor remains in either the numerator or denominator, you need to multiply them together to get a single integer. The result will be your simplified fraction.

For example:2×2×2×32×3×3×5{\displaystyle {\frac {{\cancel {2\times }}2\times 2{\cancel {\times 3}}}{{\cancel {2\times }}{\cancel {3\times }}3\times 5}}}2×23×5{\displaystyle {\frac {2\times 2}{3\times 5}}} 415{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{15}}}So, the fraction 2490{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{90}}} simplifies to 415{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{15}}}.

Avoid using your hand muscles.,
Minimize pressure.,
Do not rotate the pen.,
Practice with singular strokes of the pen.,
Write a sentence.",How to Write with a Fountain Pen2," Begin gliding the tip of the pen across the page and within the lines by pulling your arm to the side. Most people tend to write with the muscles in their hand controlling movement for each letter. Aside from a more consistent pressure being applied, you will avoid fatigue in the fingers if you use the large muscles of the arm to control your strokes.


Focus specifically on using the shoulder muscle to glide the pen across the page. Practice by writing pretend letters in the air.The wrist should remain fairly stationary.

, Unlike ballpoint pens which often require pressure, writing with a fountain pens do not require the same amount of pressure. In fact, if working properly, a fountain pen should require virtually zero pressure. Pushing down too firmly with a fountain pen can actually damage the nib and affect the flow of ink., This should be common-sense once holding the fountain pen. Some people, however, develop a habit of rotating writing devices to find an ideal spot or sharpened edge that will not work with fountain pens. Rotation with a fountain pen will change the proper page alignment, and result in potential scratching., Using your arm muscles to write in a new way will cause some fatigue and inconsistency, so it’s smart to start with the basics. Write slashes, circles, spirals, and the letter X. Write them for several lines or pages to get used to the feel of using a fountain pen. You’re looking for flowing, evenly-spaced, uniform letters.It may be beneficial to practice by using multiple lines in your first attempts, gradually shrinking the letters into the traditional single-spaced lines.

, Once you’ve practiced simple strokes, writing complete sentences could provide a different dilemma. If the nib feels like it’s scratchy, you need to try a different angle, ensure that the nib isn’t rocking as you write, or reevaluate that you’re using the proper muscles. Adjusting these techniques will allow the ink to flow freely and reduce the scratching on the paper.

Purchase an inexpensive fountain pen.,
Use new, untainted ink.,
Get a pad of lined paper.,
Sit in a comfortable chair at a desk.",How to Write with a Fountain Pen3," In the world of calligraphy, a cheap version is about $25, while specialty pens can range between $200 and $1,000. Start with a fountain pen with a removable cartridge.Experiment with different nibs. Most pens allow you to replace the nibs, so that you can try finer and larger points. From smallest to largest, nibs have five grades: extra fine, fine, medium, broad, and double broad., If the ink is several years old, has been in direct sunlight for some time, or has any signs of mold, it should probably not be used. If it is used, however, ensure it is thoroughly stirred to loosen any clumps. Black ink may be more likely to clog inside the nib of the pen because it contains gum arabic.

Waterman, Sheaffer, and Pelikan inks are thinner, more resilient inks., The lines will help you create even letters and strokes. Some even recommend using a tablet for elementary school students, the ones with the dotted line in the middle.As you get used to the pen and the size of your writing, you will be able to move to unlined paper.


Use paper that is not chemically treated. The ink doesn’t absorb as well into the paper, and it could cause the nib to pool the ink., The precision of writing with a fountain pen might exhaust your arm or hand at first, so it’s best to be as comfortable as possible. The key point is that your arm and hand are able to move freely."

Rewrite the fractions.",How to Add Fractions With Like Denominators," There are two parts to all fractions: the numerator, which is the number above the line, and the denominator, which is the number below the line. While the denominator tells you how many parts a whole has been broken into, the numerator tells you how many pieces of that whole there are.In the fraction ½, for instance, the numerator = 1 and the denominator = 2, and the fraction is one-half.;
, When two or more fractions have a common denominator, it means they all have the same number as a denominator, or that they all represent wholes that have been broken into the same number of pieces. Fractions with a common denominator can be added together very easily, and the resulting fraction will have the same denominator as the original fractions. For instance:


The fractions 3/5 and 2/5 have a common denominator of 5.
The fractions 3/8, 5/8, and 17/8 have a common denominator of 8.

, To add fractions together when they have a common denominator, you simply add all the numerators together and rewrite the sum over the original denominator.In the fractions 3/5 and 2/5, the numerators are 3 and 2.
In the fractions 3/8, 5/8, and 17/8, the numerators are 3, 5, and 17.

, In the example of 3/5 + 2/5, add the numerators 3 + 2 = 5. In the example 3/8 + 5/8 + 17/8, add the numerators 3 + 5 + 17 = 25

, Remember to use the same common denominator, since the number of parts that the whole is divided into remains the same, and you are just adding the number of individual pieces.


The fractions 3/5 + 2/5 = 5/5
The fractions 3/8 + 5/8 + 17/8 = 25/8

, Sometimes a fraction can be put into simpler terms, and this includes dividing it to get a number that’s not a fraction or decimal. In the example 5/5, this fraction can be solved easily because any fraction where the numerator and denominator are the same will equal 1.Think about it like a pie that’s been cut into three pieces. If you eat all three pieces of the pie, then you’ve eaten one whole pie.


Any fraction can be converted from a fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator, and you’ll often end up with a decimal number. For instance, 5/8 can also be written as 5 ÷ 8, which equals 0.625.

, A fraction is said to be in its simplest form when both the numerator and the denominator don’t have any common factors they can be divided by.For instance, in the fraction 3/6, both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of 3, meaning they can both be divided by 3 to produce a whole number. Therefore, the fraction 3/6 can be thought of as 3 ÷ 3 / 6 ÷ 3 = ½.

, When a fraction has a numerator that’s bigger than the denominator, such as 25/8, this is said to be an improper fraction (the reverse, when the numerator is smaller than the denominator, is a proper fraction). These can be converted into a mixed number, which is a number that has a whole number plus a proper fraction. To convert an improper fraction like 25/8 to a mixed number, you:Divide the improper fraction’s numerator by its denominator to determine how many whole times 8 goes into 25, where the answer is 25 ÷ 8 = 3(.125)
Determine what’s left over. If 8 x 3 = 24, subtract that from the original numerator: 25 – 24 = 1, where the difference is the new numerator.
Rewrite the mixed number. The denominator will be the same from your original improper fraction, meaning 25/8 can be rewritten as 3 1/8.

, For instance, look at the equation 12/26 – 4/26 – 1/26. In this example:


The numerators are 12, 4, and 1
The common denominator is 26

, Like with addition, you don’t have to worry about doing anything to the denominator, so just find the difference between the numerators:


12 – 4 – 1 = 7
Rewrite the fraction with the new numerator. 12/26 – 4/26 – 1/26 = 7/26.

, Similar to adding fractions, when you subtract fractions you can still end up with:


An improper fraction that can be converted to a mixed number
A fraction that can be solved through division
A fraction that can be put into a simpler form by finding a common denominator

, Fractions don’t always have the same denominators, and in order to add or subtract those fractions, you must first find a common denominator. To start, locate the denominators in the fractions you’re dealing with.


For instance, in the equation 5/8 + 6/9, the denominators are 8 and 9.

, To find a common denominator, you need to find the least common multiple of the two numbers, which is the smallest positive number that’s a multiple of both original numbers.To find the least common multiple of 8 and 9, you must first go through the multiples of each number:


The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, etc.
The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, etc.
The least common multiple of 8 and 9 is 72.

, Multiply each denominator by the correct number to achieve the common denominator. Remember that whatever you do to each denominator, you must also do to its numerator.


For the fraction 5/8: to achieve the common denominator of 72, you multiply 8 x 9. Therefore, you must also multiply the numerator by 9, giving you 5 x 9 = 45
For the fraction 6/9: to achieve the common denominator of 72, you multiply 9 x 8. Therefore, you must also multiply the numerator by 8, giving you 6 x 8 = 48, The new fraction will have the common denominator and the product of the numerators multiplied by the same values:


The fraction 5/8 becomes 45/72, and the fraction 6/9 becomes 48/72.
Since they now have a common denominator, you can add the fractions 45/72 + 48/72 = 93/72.
Don’t forget to reduce, solve, or convert improper fractions to mixed numbers when applicable and necessary.

Sharpen natural quills.,
Monitor the ink buildup on metal nibs.,
Choose ink made for quill pens.,
Begin with thicker paper.,
Progress to conventional paper.",How to Write With a Feather Quill," Place a flat felt cushion under the paper. This will keep the quill nib sharper longer.A quill pen can only be sharpened so many times before it becomes unusable. Pens that don’t have to be sharpened as often will last longer.;
, Let the quill rest between your thumb and forefinger. Grip the area above the nib with you thumb and forefinger. If the quill is made from a natural feather, don’t squeeze too hard. Otherwise, you could crack it and make it unusable.

, Submerge the nib in the inkwell. Slowly draw it up. Scrape the excess ink off the nib and back into the well. Too much ink will bleed through the paper, possibly wasting an entire sheet. If you don’t get enough ink on the quill, you can at least redip it into the ink. You’ll have to dip your quill regularly as you write. Each dip will give you about three to six words.







, Advice ranges from a downward angle of 45 degrees to perpendicular (90 degrees). The nib should face left for right-handed people and right for left-handed people. This will ensure thin, manageable lines. If your nib faces straight up or down, it will produce lines that are too thick to form legible words.

, Apply very light pressure to the paper.Too much pressure could break your pen, tear the paper, or dull the nib too quickly. As you write, try to do so until you need to redip your pen. Stopping too often will cause unsightly ink blobs on your paper.








, When you have finished writing, sprinkle sand on top of the inked paper. This will soak up any excess ink without destroying your writing. Let the sand sit for a few minutes. Then, either shake or blow the sand off the paper.You should do this either outside or over a trash can to avoid making a mess.








, Whether the nib is the shaft of a feather or a metal nib, you should rinse it thoroughly with water after writing. This will prolong your quill’s lifespan and ensure the quality of the instrument is maintained.








, If you use a natural feather pen, let the cleaned shaft air dry. It will reconstitute and harden on its own.A metal nib, on the other hand, should be dried gently with a cloth towel or paper towel. Like any form of metal, it can rust if water is left on the surface too long.








, Quill pens are not available everywhere. The easiest place to find quill pens is an online store such as Etsy or Amazon or your local art supply store. If you live near a historic site, you could check the gift shop for inexpensive quill pens.


Traditional quill pens are large feathers whose shafts have been hollowed out as ink reservoirs. These pens tend to have softer tips that are less likely to puncture paper.Quill pens with metal nibs have been widely available since the early nineteenth century.If you’re feeling crafty, you can make your own pen.

, If you have a traditional quill made entirely from a feather, you will have to sharpen the nib periodically.One telltale sign of a dull nib is an increased amount of ink flooding onto the paper. Using a penknife, extend the slit in the center of the shaft. Trim a small amount from each side the nib in diagonal strokes. After that, flatten the inside of the nib and snip off any excess shaft hanging from the tip.







, Blot the nib frequently during the writing process. You can do this with a scrap sheet of paper, a paper towel, or old rag. If any ink has dried on the metal, gently scrape it off with a pen knife.Dried ink will corrode a metal nib if it is allowed to stay on the surface.








, Ink consistency is key. Choose ink that’s opaque but also thin enough to produce legible writing. Avoid India ink because its consistency is both thick and sticky and won't flow as freely.


Calligraphy ink is a popular choice.
Iron gall ink, originally used by Medieval monks, is still available at craft stores like Etsy. Today, you could choose traditional black ink or a variety of other colors.For tight budgets, liquid grape juice concentrate is a viable alternative., When you first use your feather quill pen, you should begin with thicker paper. Stationery, construction paper, or textured printing paper is a good option. Continue to use thicker paper until you become comfortable with pressure and style best suited for writing with a feather quill.

, After you practice on thicker paper, you’ll be able to write with your feather quill on any paper surface. You can choose from conventional lined notebook paper or computer paper. However, if you prefer a traditional look, you can opt for parchment paper.

Pick the right kind of pencil for your needs.,
Decide on a hardness and thickness.,
Keep your pencil sharp, but not too sharp.,
Use your pencil.,
Avoid smudges.,
Erase as needed.,
Take your pencil game up a notch!,
Use a pencil grip if needed.",How to Use a Pencil1," Pencils come in many shapes and sizes: there are full-sized wooden pencils, mechanical pencils, small golf pencils, graphite pencils, charcoal pencils, carbon pencils, colored pencils, grease pencils, and watercolor pencils. Depending on whether you want to write, draw, sketch or colour, you may need to pick your instrument carefully., In Europe, pencils are classified on a continuum from ""H"" for hardness to ""B"" for blackness. Most people choose an HB pencil (in the middle of the spectrum) for regular writing, but go harder for light-marking needs or blacker for heavier marking needs (darker, stronger lines).Mechanical pencils also offer a range of possibilities for lead thickness, usually ranging between 0.13 mm and 2.00 mm.. For most regular writing and school purposes, people tend to use lead of size 0.5 mm or 0.7 mm.If you're not sure what you need, just go with something in that range, and make sure that any extra lead you buy fits in the mechanical pencil you have.

, If you're using a standard, non-mechanical pencil, you'll need to sharpen it. You can use a handheld sharpener, a manual (school-style) sharpener, an electric sharpener, or - if you're brave, a craft knife or razor blade. Some sharpeners come with containers to catch the shavings, too.


If you sharpen your pencil into too fine a point, you may end up making it more likely to break. If your pencil is very sharp, avoid pushing down hard on the paper, particularly at an angle.

, Once you're ready to go, use it! Write, draw, sketch, or color in whatever way you were planning to. If you're having trouble holding the pencil, use some tips from the section below on teaching about pencil grip. Re-sharpen the pencil when needed (or push the button to release more lead, if you're using a mechanical pencil).

, The biggest downside of a pencil is that it can smudge if you move your hand across the paper after writing. This happens especially to left-handed people, who often find that the heel of their writing hands drag along the paper and smudge what they've just written. If this happens to you, try adjusting your hand placement so that it doesn't smear so much.


Using good quality pencils and paper will help avoid smudging. Harder pencils are also less likely to smudge, compared to softer/blacker pencils.
Try putting another piece of paper under your hand. If you find your work is smearing a lot, place a small piece of scratch paper right under your writing hand (and sliding it along with you as you move your hand), to stop the sweat and oil from your hand from smudging the pencil.

, The upside of pencil over pens or other writing utensils is that most of them can be erased. If you buy a high quality eraser and have a regular writing pencil, you should be able to erase your markings as needed to fix mistakes, reword writing, or adjust your sketching.

, If you're getting into drawing and writing with pencils, you might try drawing or writing with colored pencils, watercolor pencils. or charcoal pencils.

, Some people find it uncomfortable to write with pencils for extended periods of time. In this case, a pencil gripper can help provide comfort and improve pencil grasp. You can buy foam or rubber pencil grips to put on your pencils, or you can even make your own with Rainbow Loom bands or clay.

Shoot for the tripod grip.,
Let toddlers and young children experiment with pencil holds.,
Use crafts and other fun fine motor activities to build finger dexterity in children.,
Try finger exercises for children and older individuals who need help with the pencil grip.,
Use a pencil grip if needed.,
Be patient and take breaks.",How to Use a Pencil2," The ideal pencil grip uses the writer's thumb, index finger, and middle finger, in a pinched motion. The writer should have their index finger on top of the pencil, and the thumb and middle finger underneath, supporting the pencil.


Young children tend to hold pencils with a fist or palmer's grip and make big movements of the arm to draw or write. As they get older, the grip moves towards a five-finger and then tripod grip, and the writer goes from moving their whole arm to moving just their wrist and hand. As the grip develops further, the writer keeps their little and ring fingers curled up and writes using smaller movements of the fingers, hand, and wrist.

, They don't need to hold the pencil correctly right away. In fact, trying to teach them the tripod grip at too young an age when their muscles aren't ready can actually lead to fine motor problems.Young children are likely to hold the pencil with a fist, a palmar grasp, or all five fingers at once, and this okay at their stage.Most kids develop the mature tripod grasp around ages 5 to 6, or even older.

, Let them play with playdough, do finger games, play with blocks and other small toys, make bead necklaces, and use scissors, glue, and other craft tools. The whole range of ""preschool jobs"" in this area helps to build finger strength and fine motor skills. By developing hand strength and finger dexterity, children will ready themselves for better writing with pencils later on.

, If the writer is struggling even with crafts and fine motor play, try activities such as crumpling newspaper into a ball, rolling small balls and snakes from clay, and practicing finger control by balancing a beanbag on the fingertips (all five at the same time).After developing strength through this kind of exercise, the writer will be better equipped to try crafts like origami and beadwork, and will hopefully develop the strength needed for a better pencil grip.

, Some children and other new writers benefit from the use of a pencil gripper/grasp. It guides their fingers into the correct position and helps make writing more comfortable. You can buy foam or rubber pencil grips to put on your pencils, or you can even make your own with Rainbow Loom bands or clay.

, If a child or other individual has difficulty holding a pencil or generally writing, it can be very frustrating for them. Don't heap on the pressure. Let them practice at their own pace, take breaks, and choose what kinds of activities to work on. If you're in an educational or parenting role, use a lot of positive reinforcement to encourage good writing and good pencil grip, rather than focusing on what they do ""wrongly.""

Convert the equations into y= form In order to graph an equation on your calculator, the left side of the equation must only contain y.,
Plug the equations into your calculator.,
Make sure all plots are turned off and other equations cleared.,
Choose an appropriate window.,
Find the intersection of the graphs.,
Write down your solution.",How to Use a Graphing Calculator to Solve a Systems of Equations1," This is pretty easy to do, especially if you are dealing with linear equations. All you have to do is solve your equation for y. If it is a linear systems in standard form (Ax+By=C), then you can just write down the following equation, subbing in for the constants A, B, and C: y=(c-ax)/b or you can use the second method. If your equations are in slope intercept form, you already have the equation in y= form.;
, Press the y= button, usually the top left button on your calculator, and type in your first equation under y1 and your second equation under y2. Since you can only use 2 variables with this method, you shouldn't need more than 2 equations. If instead of y=, you have something else, make sure you are in function mode by pressing the mode button and making sure ""Func"" is highlighted.

, On the TI83, plots that are turned on are highlighted in the y= menu. If there are any on, simply move your cursor over them and press enter. You should also scroll down on the y= screen to make sure there are no other equations set to graph. If there are you have two options:


If you might need the equation later, move your cursor to the ""="" sign and press enter to unselect it. Only the entries with their ""="" signs highlighted will graph, but your equation will still be entered if you need it. To make the equation graph again, move your cursor onto the ""="" sign again and press enter to highlight it.
If you won't need the equation later, move your cursor to the entry (not the ""="" sign) and press clear. You can't retrieve the equation if you do this, so be sure you want to clear it before you do this.

, Guess at what your answer might be. You want to be your answer is on the screen. Press the ""window"" button, usually the button just to the right of the y= button. The xmin should be considerably less than your guess and the xmax should be considerably higher. Then, instead of worrying about your y=, just press the ""zoom"" button just to the right of the ""window"" button then scroll down to ""ZoomFit"" and press enter. In a few seconds your graph should appear on the screen. If you can't see the intersection of the graphs, adjust the window until you can.

, Press ""2nd"" then ""Trace"" to bring you to the ""Calculate"" menu. Scroll down to intersect and press enter. It should prompt ""First curve?"" Make sure your cursor is on one of the graphs and press enter. It should then prompt ""Second curve?"" Make sure your cursor is on the other graph and press enter. It will prompt ""Guess?"" The easiest way to do this for equations that only intersect once is to press enter again. If they intersect twice on the same page, either enter a value that is close to the x value where they intersect (You could use your estimated value for x in step 4) or move your cursor near where they intersect. Remember: it doesn't have to be perfect; your calculator is just trying to make sure it finds the right intersection point for you. It doesn't really need an accurate guess. To navigate on the graph screen:


Press the up and down buttons to switch between graphs. This will not change your x value.
Press the left and right buttons to move along the graph. Your x value change will be incremental, your y change will be the output of the x value, so your cursor may move faster some times and slower others.

, On the bottom of your screen, your calculator should say ""x=a number"" and ""y=a number."" These are your answers. Copy them down to the desired accuracy.

This null space is said to have dimension 3, for there are three basis vectors in this set, and is a subset of R5,{\displaystyle {\mathbb {R} }^{5},} for the number of entries in each vector.

Notice that the basis vectors do not have much in common with the rows of A{\displaystyle A} at first, but a quick check by taking the inner product of any of the rows of A{\displaystyle A} with any of the basis vectors of Nul⁡A{\displaystyle \operatorname {Nul} A} confirms that they are orthogonal.

Begin with the matrix equation.,
Row-reduce A{\displaystyle A} to row-echelon form.,
Obtain L{\displaystyle L} by undoing your row-reduction steps.,
Rewrite the matrix equation Ax=b{\displaystyle A{\mathbf {x} }={\mathbf {b} }} in terms of LU{\displaystyle LU}.,
Solve for y{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }}.,
Solve for x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }}.",How to Perform an LU Factorization," Fundamentally, a system of equations can be written in terms of a matrix equation Ax=b,{\displaystyle A{\mathbf {x} }={\mathbf {b} },} where matrix A{\displaystyle A} acts on a vector x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} to output another vector b.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }.} It is often the case that we wish to know x,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} },} and this is no exception. In LU factorization, we will see that we can define the relation A=LU,{\displaystyle A=LU,} where L{\displaystyle L} and U{\displaystyle U} are both triangular matrices.


(241−113325)x=(217){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}2&4&1\\-1&1&3\\3&2&5\end{pmatrix}}{\mathbf {x} }={\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\\7\end{pmatrix}}}
;
, The row-echelon form will become our matrix U.{\displaystyle U.}


R2→2R2+R1, R3→2R3−3R1{\displaystyle R_{2}\to 2R_{2}+R_{1},\ R_{3}\to 2R_{3}-3R_{1}}


(2410670−87){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}2&4&1\\0&6&7\\0&-8&7\end{pmatrix}}}




R3→3R3+4R2{\displaystyle R_{3}\to 3R_{3}+4R_{2}}


(2410670049)=U{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}2&4&1\\0&6&7\\0&0&49\end{pmatrix}}=U}



The matrix is in row-echelon form now. 


, This step may be a bit tricky at first, but we are essentially constructing a matrix by going backwards. 

Let's look at the most recent row reduction R3→3R3+4R2.{\displaystyle R_{3}\to 3R_{3}+4R_{2}.} We found the new row 3 by replacing it with a linear combination of the old rows of the matrix. Now, we wish to find the old row 3, so simply solve.


R3old→R3−4R23{\displaystyle R_{3}^{\text{old}}\to {\frac {R_{3}-4R_{2}}{3}}}



This undoes the second row-reduction. Now, we put it in matrix form. Let's call this matrix S2.{\displaystyle S_{2}.} The column vector to the right simply clarifies what we are doing - this matrix we are constructing is a linear transformation that does the same thing as what we just wrote above. Observe that, since we didn't do anything to the top two rows, the resulting elements for the two rows in this matrix are the same as in the identity matrix. Only the third row changes.


(1000100−4/31/3)(R1R2R3){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&-4/3&1/3\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}R_{1}\\R_{2}\\R_{3}\end{pmatrix}}}



Construct the matrix that undoes the first row-reduction. Similarly, we are solving for the old row 2 and 3. We'll call this matrix S1.{\displaystyle S_{1}.}


R2old=R2−R12{\displaystyle R_{2}^{\text{old}}={\frac {R_{2}-R_{1}}{2}}}


R3old=R3+3R12{\displaystyle R_{3}^{\text{old}}={\frac {R_{3}+3R_{1}}{2}}}


S1=(100−1/21/203/201/2){\displaystyle S_{1}={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\-1/2&1/2&0\\3/2&0&1/2\end{pmatrix}}}



Multiply the S{\displaystyle S} matrices in the order that we found them. This means that S2S1=L.{\displaystyle S_{2}S_{1}=L.} If you did the multiplication correctly, you should get a lower triangular matrix.


L=(100−1/21/203/2−4/61/6){\displaystyle L={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\-1/2&1/2&0\\3/2&-4/6&1/6\end{pmatrix}}}




, Now that we have both matrices, we can see below that L{\displaystyle L} acting on the vector Ux{\displaystyle U{\mathbf {x} }} outputs b.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }.} 


L(Ux)=b{\displaystyle L(U{\mathbf {x} })={\mathbf {b} }}

Since Ux{\displaystyle U{\mathbf {x} }} is a vector, let y=Ux.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }=U{\mathbf {x} }.} Then, we see that Ly=b.{\displaystyle L{\mathbf {y} }={\mathbf {b} }.} The goal here is to first solve for y,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} },} then plug into Ux=y{\displaystyle U{\mathbf {x} }={\mathbf {y} }} to solve for x.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }.}


, Because we are dealing with triangular matrices, back-substitution is the way to go. 


Ly=(y1−12y1+12y232y1−23y2+16y3)=(217){\displaystyle L{\mathbf {y} }={\begin{pmatrix}y_{1}\\-{\frac {1}{2}}y_{1}+{\frac {1}{2}}y_{2}\\{\frac {3}{2}}y_{1}-{\frac {2}{3}}y_{2}+{\frac {1}{6}}y_{3}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\\7\end{pmatrix}}}


y=(2440){\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }={\begin{pmatrix}2\\4\\40\end{pmatrix}}}


, This will again involve back-substitution, because U{\displaystyle U} is triangular.


Ux=(2x1+4x2+x36x2+7x349x3)=(2440){\displaystyle U{\mathbf {x} }={\begin{pmatrix}2x_{1}+4x_{2}+x_{3}\\6x_{2}+7x_{3}\\49x_{3}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}2\\4\\40\end{pmatrix}}}


x=(57/49−2/740/49){\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }={\begin{pmatrix}57/49\\-2/7\\40/49\end{pmatrix}}}

Although this method may not seem very efficient to you (and indeed, LU factorization for systems of three equations is no better than row-reduction), computers are well-equipped to perform back-substitution, so the results really show as the number of equations goes up.

M=(a11a12a13a21a22a23a31a32a33)=(153247462){\displaystyle M={\begin{pmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}1&5&3\\2&4&7\\4&6&2\end{pmatrix}}}
;
, This will be your reference row or column. You'll get the same answer no matter which one you choose. For now, just pick the first row. Later, we'll give some advice on how to choose the easiest option to calculate.

Let's choose the first row of our example matrix A. Circle the 1 5 3. In general terms, circle a11 a12 a13.


, Look at the row or column you circled and select the first element. Draw a line through its row and column. You should be left with four numbers. We'll treat these as a 2 x 2 matrix.

In our example, our reference row is 1 5 3. The first element is in row 1 and column 1. Cross out all of row 1 and column 1. Write the remaining elements as a 2 x 2 matrix:


 1  5 3 2  4 7 4  6 2


, Remember, the matrix (abcd){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}} has a determinant of ad - bc.You may have learned this by drawing an X across the 2 x 2 matrix. Multiply the two numbers connected by the \ of the X. Then subtract the product of the two numbers connected by the /. Use this formula to calculate the determinate of the matrix you just found.

In our example, the determinant of the matrix (4762){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}4&7\\6&2\end{pmatrix}}} = 4 * 2 - 7 * 6 = -34.

This determinant is called the minor of the element we chose in our original matrix.In this case, we just found the minor of a11.


, Remember, you selected an element from your reference row (or column) when you decided which row and column to cross out. Multiply this element by the determinant you just calculated for the 2x2 matrix.

In our example, we selected a11, which had a value of 1. Multiply this by -34 (the determinant of the 2x2) to get 1*-34 = -34.


, Next, you'll multiply your answer either by 1 or by -1 to get the cofactor of your chosen element. Which you use depends on where the element was placed in the 3x3 matrix. Memorize this simple sign chart to track which element causes which:


+ - +- + -+ - +

Since we chose a11, marked with a +, we multiply the number by +1. (In other words, leave it alone.) The answer is still -34.

Alternatively, you can find the sign with the formula (-1)i+j, where i and j are the element's row and column., Return to the original 3x3 matrix, with the row or column you circled earlier. Repeat the same process with this element:


Cross out the row and column of that element. In our case, select element a12 (with a value of 5). Cross out row one (1 5 3) and column two (546){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}5\\4\\6\end{pmatrix}}}.


Treat the remaining elements as a 2x2 matrix. In our example, the matrix is (2742){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}2&7\\4&2\end{pmatrix}}}


Find the determinant of this 2x2 matrix. Use the ad - bc formula. (2*2 - 7*4 = -24)


Multiply by the chosen element of the 3x3 matrix. -24 * 5 = -120


Determine whether to multiply by -1. Use the sign chart or the (-1)ij formula. We chose element a12, which is - on the sign chart. We must change the sign of our answer: (-1)*(-120) = 120.


, You have one more cofactor to find. Calculate i for the third term in your reference row or column. Here's a quick rundown of how you'd calculate the cofactor of a13 in our example:

Cross out row 1 and column 3 to get  (2446){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}2&4\\4&6\end{pmatrix}}}

Its determinant is 2*6 - 4*4 = -4.

Multiply by element a13: -4 * 3 = -12.

Element a13 is + on the sign chart, so the answer is -12.


, This is the final step. You've calculated three cofactors, one for each element in a single row or column. Add these together and you've found the determinant of the 3x3 matrix.

In our example the determinant is -34 + 120 + -12 = 74.


, Remember, you can pick any row or column as your reference. You'll get the same answer no matter which you pick. If you pick a row or column with zeros, you only need to calculate the cofactor for the nonzero elements. Here's why:

Let's say you pick row 2, with elements a21, a22, and a23. To solve this problem, we'll be looking at three different 2x2 matrices. Let's call them A21, A22, and A23.

The determinant of the 3x3 matrix is a21|A21| - a22|A22| + a23|A23|.

If terms a22 and a23 are both 0, our formula becomes a21|A21| - 0*|A22| + 0*|A23| = a21|A21| - 0 + 0 = a21|A21|. Now we only have to calculate the cofactor of a single element.


, If you take the values of one row and add them to a different row, the determinant of the matrix does not change. The same is true of columns. You can do this repeatedly — or multiply the values by a constant before adding — to get as many zeroes in the matrix as possible. This can save you a lot of time.

For example, say you have a 3 x 3 matrix: (9−1231075−2){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}9&-1&2\\3&1&0\\7&5&-2\end{pmatrix}}}

In order to cancel out the 9 in position a11, we can multiply the second row by -3 and add the result to the first. The new first row is + = .

The new matrix is (0−4231075−2){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0&-4&2\\3&1&0\\7&5&-2\end{pmatrix}}} Try to use the same trick with columns to turn a12 into a 0 as well.


, In these special cases, the determinant is simply the product of the elements along the main diagonal, from a11 in the top left to a33 in the lower right. We're still talking about 3x3 matrices, but ""triangular"" ones have special patterns of nonzero values:Upper triangular matrix: All the non-zero elements are on or above the main diagonal. Everything below is a zero.

Lower triangular matrix: All the non-zero elements are on or below the main diagonal.

Diagonal matrix: All the non-zero elements are on the main diagonal. (A subset of the above.)

If the determinant is 0, then your work is finished, because the matrix has no inverse. The determinant of matrix M can be represented symbolically as det(M).For a 3x3 matrix, find the determinant by first 

To review finding the determinant of a matrix, see Find the Determinant of a 3X3 Matrix.
;
, Transposing means reflecting the matrix about the main diagonal, or equivalently, swapping the (i,j)th element and the (j,i)th. When you transpose the terms of the matrix, you should see that the main diagonal (from upper left to lower right) is unchanged.Another way to think of transposing is that you rewrite the first row as the first column, the middle row becomes the middle column, and the third row becomes the third column. Notice the colored elements in the diagram above and see where the numbers have changed position.


, Every item of the newly transposed 3x3 matrix is associated with a corresponding 2x2 “minor” matrix. To find the right minor matrix for each term, first highlight the row and column of the term you begin with. This should include five terms of the matrix. The remaining four terms make up the minor matrix.In the example shown above, if you want the minor matrix of the term in the second row, first column, you highlight the five terms that are in the second row and the first column. The remaining four terms are the corresponding minor matrix.

Find the determinant of each minor matrix by cross-multiplying the diagonals and subtracting, as shown.

For more on minor matrices and their uses, see Understand the Basics of Matrices.


, Place the results of the previous step into a new matrix of cofactors by aligning each minor matrix determinant with the corresponding position in the original matrix. Thus, the determinant that you calculated from item (1,1) of the original matrix goes in position (1,1). You must then reverse the sign of alternating terms of this new matrix, following the “checkerboard” pattern shown.When assigning signs, the first element of the first row keeps its original sign. The second element is reversed. The third element keeps its original sign. Continue on with the rest of the matrix in this fashion. Note that the (+) or (-) signs in the checkerboard diagram do not suggest that the final term should be positive or negative. They are indicators of keeping (+) or reversing (-) whatever sign the number originally had.

For a review of cofactors, see Understand the Basics of Matrices.

The final result of this step is called the adjugate matrix of the original. This is sometimes referred to as the adjoint matrix. The adjugate matrix is noted as Adj(M).


, Recall the determinant of M that you calculated in the first step (to check that the inverse was possible). You now divide every term of the matrix by that value. Place the result of each calculation into the spot of the original term. The result is the inverse of the original matrix.For the sample matrix shown in the diagram, the determinant is 1. Therefore, dividing every term of the adjugate matrix results in the adjugate matrix itself. (You won’t always be so lucky.)

Instead of dividing, some sources represent this step as multiplying each term of M by 1/det(M). Mathematically, these are equivalent.

In general, keep identifying your pivots.",How to Reduce a Matrix to Row Echelon Form," The row-echelon form is where the leading (first non-zero) entry of each row has only zeroes below it. These leading entries are called pivots, and an analysis of the relation between the pivots and their locations in a matrix can tell much about the matrix itself. An example of a matrix in row-echelon form is below.


(112013005){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&1&2\\0&1&3\\0&0&5\end{pmatrix}}}
;
, There are three row operations that one can do to a matrix.

Row swapping. 

Scalar multiplication. Any row can be replaced by a non-zero scalar multiple of that row. 

Row addition. A row can be replaced by itself plus a multiple of another row. 


,


(112123345){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&1&2\\1&2&3\\3&4&5\end{pmatrix}}}


, The pivots are essential to understanding the row reduction process. When reducing a matrix to row-echelon form, the entries below the pivots of the matrix are all 0. 

For our matrix, the first pivot is simply the top left entry. In general, this will be the case, unless the top left entry is 0. If this is the case, swap rows until the top left entry is non-zero.

By their nature, there can only be one pivot per column and per row. When we selected the top left entry as our first pivot, none of the other entries in the pivot's column or row can become pivots. 


, 

For our matrix, we want to obtain 0's for the entries below the first pivot. Replace the second row with itself minus the first row. Replace the third row with itself minus three times the first row. These row reductions can be succinctly written as R2→R2−R1{\displaystyle R_{2}\to R_{2}-R_{1}} and R3→R3−3R1.{\displaystyle R_{3}\to R_{3}-3R_{1}.}


(11201101−1){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&1&2\\0&1&1\\0&1&-1\end{pmatrix}}}


, The second pivot can either be the middle or the middle bottom entry, but it cannot be the middle top entry, because that row already contains a pivot. We will choose the middle entry as the second pivot, although the middle bottom works just as well. 
,


R3→R3−R2{\displaystyle R_{3}\to R_{3}-R_{2}}


(11201100−2){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&1&2\\0&1&1\\0&0&-2\end{pmatrix}}}

This matrix is in row-echelon form now.

If your matrix is not square, there is no inverse., If your matrix has 2 rows and 2 columns, you can find its inverse directly with the method above. If your matrix has 3 or more rows and 3 or more columns, use this method.

For example, take this matrix:
This matrix, A, is square with 3 rows and 3 columns, so you should use this second method.

, Let arc be the element in the matrix at the rth row and the cth column. Its cofactor Arc will then be (-1)r+c det (arc), where det (arc) is the determinant of a matrix formed by skipping the rth row and the cth column, in which element arc lies.

In the example above, all the cofactors are:
A11 =5 , A12 =-1 ,A13 =-7 ,A21 =-1 ,A22 =-7 ,A23 =-5 ,A31 =-7 ,A32 =5 ,A33 =-1

, A determinant is a particular number that can be calculated from any square matrix. It is typically denoted with vertical bars, just like an absolute value. Add all the cofactors of all the elements in the first row of the matrix to find the determinant.

In the example above, you would calculate the determinant as follows:
A11 + 2 A12 + 3 A13 = 5-2-21=-18

When this occurs, the null space of A{\displaystyle A} becomes non-trivial - in other words, there are non-zero vectors that satisfy the homogeneous equation Ax=0.{\displaystyle A{\mathbf {x} }=0.}

, As mentioned in the introduction, the action of A{\displaystyle A} on x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} is simple, and the result only differs by a multiplicative constant λ,{\displaystyle \lambda ,} called the eigenvalue. Vectors that are associated with that eigenvalue are called eigenvectors. 


Ax=λx{\displaystyle A{\mathbf {x} }=\lambda {\mathbf {x} }}

We can set the equation to zero, and obtain the homogeneous equation. Below, I{\displaystyle I} is the identity matrix.


(A−λI)x=0{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I){\mathbf {x} }=0}


, In order for (A−λI)x=0{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I){\mathbf {x} }=0} to have non-trivial solutions, the null space of A−λI{\displaystyle A-\lambda I} must be non-trivial as well. 

The only way this can happen is if det(A−λI)=0.{\displaystyle \det(A-\lambda I)=0.} This is the characteristic equation.


, det(A−λI){\displaystyle \det(A-\lambda I)} yields a polynomial of degree n{\displaystyle n} for n×n{\displaystyle n\times n} matrices. 

Consider the matrix A=(1432).{\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}1&4\\3&2\end{pmatrix}}.} 


|1−λ432−λ|=0(1−λ)(2−λ)−12=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\begin{vmatrix}1-\lambda &4\\3&2-\lambda \end{vmatrix}}&=0\\(1-\lambda )(2-\lambda )-12&=0\end{aligned}}}

Notice that the polynomial seems backwards - the quantities in parentheses should be variable minus number, rather than the other way around. This is easy to deal with by moving the 12 to the right and multiplying by (−1)2{\displaystyle (-1)^{2}} to both sides to reverse the order.


(λ−1)(λ−2)=12λ2−3λ−10=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(\lambda -1)(\lambda -2)&=12\\\lambda ^{2}-3\lambda -10&=0\end{aligned}}}


, This is, in general, a difficult step for finding eigenvalues, as there exists no general solution for quintic functions or higher polynomials. However, we are dealing with a matrix of dimension 2, so the quadratic is easily solved.


(λ−5)(λ+2)=0λ=5,−2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&(\lambda -5)(\lambda +2)=0\\&\lambda =5,-2\end{aligned}}}


, Let's substitute λ1=5{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}=5} first.


(A−5I)x=(−443−3){\displaystyle (A-5I){\mathbf {x} }={\begin{pmatrix}-4&4\\3&-3\end{pmatrix}}}

The resulting matrix is obviously linearly dependent. We are on the right track here. 


, With larger matrices, it may not be so obvious that the matrix is linearly dependent, and so we must row-reduce. Here, however, we can immediately perform the row operation R2→4R2+3R1{\displaystyle R_{2}\to 4R_{2}+3R_{1}} to obtain a row of 0's.


(−4400){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}-4&4\\0&0\end{pmatrix}}}

The matrix above says that −4x1+4x2=0.{\displaystyle -4x_{1}+4x_{2}=0.} Simplify and reparameterize x2=t,{\displaystyle x_{2}=t,} as it is a free variable. 


, The previous step has led us to the basis of the null space of A−5I{\displaystyle A-5I} - in other words, the eigenspace of A{\displaystyle A} with eigenvalue 5.


x1=(11){\displaystyle {\mathbf {x_{1}} }={\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}}}

Performing steps 6 to 8 with λ2=−2{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}=-2} results in the following eigenvector associated with eigenvalue -2.


x2=(−43){\displaystyle {\mathbf {x_{2}} }={\begin{pmatrix}-4\\3\end{pmatrix}}}

These are the eigenvectors associated with their respective eigenvalues. For the basis of the entire eigenspace of A,{\displaystyle A,} we write


{(11),(−43)}.{\displaystyle \left\{{\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}},{\begin{pmatrix}-4\\3\end{pmatrix}}\right\}.}

However, this process becomes much slower as the number of equations goes up. Row-reduction allows you to use the same techniques, but in a more systematic way. Below, we consider a system of 4 equations with 4 unknowns.


x1+x2+2x3=12x1−x2−2x4=−2x1−x2−x3+x4=42x1−x2+2x3=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&x_{1}+x_{2}+2x_{3}=1\\&2x_{1}-x_{2}-2x_{4}=-2\\&x_{1}-x_{2}-x_{3}+x_{4}=4\\&2x_{1}-x_{2}+2x_{3}=0\end{aligned}}}

It is helpful, for purposes of clarity, to align the equations such that by looking from top to bottom, the coefficients of each variable are easily recognized, especially since the variables are only differentiated by subscripts.  
;
, The matrix equation Ax=b{\displaystyle A{\mathbf {x} }={\mathbf {b} }} is the basic foundation of row-reduction. This equation says that a matrix acting on a vector x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} produces another vector b.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }.}

Recognize that we can write the variables and constants as these vectors. Here, x=(x1,x2,x3,x4),{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4}),} where x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} is a column vector. The constants can be written as a column vector b.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }.}

What's left is the coefficients. Here, we put the coefficients into a matrix A.{\displaystyle A.} Make sure that every row in the matrix corresponds to an equation, and every column corresponds to a variable. 


(11202−10−21−1−112−120)(x1x2x3x4)=(1−240){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&1&2&0\\2&-1&0&-2\\1&-1&-1&1\\2&-1&2&0\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}x_{1}\\x_{2}\\x_{3}\\x_{4}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}1\\-2\\4\\0\end{pmatrix}}}


, As shown, a vertical bar separates the coefficients, written as a matrix A,{\displaystyle A,} from the constants, written as a vector b.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }.} The vertical bar signals the presence of the augmented matrix (A|b).{\displaystyle (A|{\mathbf {b} }).}

, Now that we have the system of equations as a matrix, we need to manipulate it so that we get the desired answer. There are three row operations that we can perform on the matrix without changing the solution. In this step, a row of a matrix will be denoted by R,{\displaystyle R,} where a subscript will tell us which row it is.


Row swapping. Simply swap two rows. This is useful in some situations, which we'll get to a bit later. If we want to swap rows 1 and 4, we denote it by R1↔R4.{\displaystyle R_{1}\leftrightarrow R_{4}.}


Scalar multiple. You can replace a row with a scalar multiple of it. For example, if you want to replace row 2 with 5 times itself, you write R2→5R2.{\displaystyle R_{2}\to 5R_{2}.}


Row addition. You can replace a row with the sum of itself and a linear combination of the other rows. If we want to replace row 3 with itself plus twice row 4, we write R3→R3+2R4.{\displaystyle R_{3}\to R_{3}+2R_{4}.} If we want to replace row 2 with itself, plus row 3, plus twice row 4, we write R2→R2+R3+2R4.{\displaystyle R_{2}\to R_{2}+R_{3}+2R_{4}.}

We can do these row operations at the same time, and among the three row operations, the latter two will be the most useful.


, A pivot is the leading coefficient of each row. It is unique to each row and column, and identifies a variable with its equation. Let's see how this works.

In general, the first pivot will always be the top left number, so x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} has ""its"" equation. In our case, the first pivot is the 1 on the top left.

If the top left number is a 0, swap rows until it is not. In our case, we don't need to. 


, When this happens after we have identified all of our pivots, the matrix will be in row-echelon form. The row in which the pivot rests does not change.

Replace row 2 with itself minus twice row 1. This guarantees that the element in row 2, column 1 will be a 0. 

Replace row 3 with itself minus row 1. This guarantees that the element in row 3, column 1 will be a 0. 

Replace row 4 with itself minus twice row 1. The element in row 4, column 1 will be a 0. Since these row operations pertain to different rows, we can do them simultaneously. There is no need to write out four matrices as part of showing your work.  

These row operations can be summarized below.


R2→R2−2R1R3→R3−R1R4→R4−2R1{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}R_{2}&\to R_{2}-2R_{1}\\R_{3}&\to R_{3}-R_{1}\\R_{4}&\to R_{4}-2R_{1}\end{aligned}}}


(112010−3−4−2−40−2−3130−3−20−2){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&1&2&0&1\\0&-3&-4&-2&-4\\0&-2&-3&1&3\\0&-3&-2&0&-2\end{array}}\right)}


,

The second pivot can be anything from the second column except that in the first row, because the first pivot already makes it unavailable. Let's choose the element in row 2, column 2. Bear in mind that if a pivot not on the diagonal is chosen, you must row swap so that it is.

Perform the following row operations such that everything below the pivot is 0.


R3→3R3−2R2R4→R4−R2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}R_{3}&\to 3R_{3}-2R_{2}\\R_{4}&\to R_{4}-R_{2}\end{aligned}}}


(112010−3−4−2−400−171700222){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&1&2&0&1\\0&-3&-4&-2&-4\\0&0&-1&7&17\\0&0&2&2&2\end{array}}\right)}


, 

The third pivot cannot be from the first or second rows. Let's choose the element in row 3, column 3. Notice a pattern here. We are choosing pivots along the diagonal of the matrix. 

Perform the following row operation. After doing so, the fourth pivot automatically comes out as the lower right element of the matrix. 


R4→R4+2R3{\displaystyle R_{4}\to R_{4}+2R_{3}}


(112010−3−4−2−400−17170001636){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&1&2&0&1\\0&-3&-4&-2&-4\\0&0&-1&7&17\\0&0&0&16&36\end{array}}\right)}

This matrix is in row-echelon form now. The pivots have been identified, and everything to the left and below the pivots is 0. Keep in mind that this is a row-echelon form - they are not unique, for different row operations may yield a matrix that looks nothing like the one above.

You can immediately net x4=94{\displaystyle x_{4}={\frac {9}{4}}} and proceed to substitute to get all other variables. This is called back substitution, and is what computers use after reaching row-echelon form to solve systems of equations. However, we will continue to row-reduce until there stands nothing but the pivots and the constants. 


, Unlike ordinary row-echelon, RREF is unique to the matrix, because it requires two additional conditions:

The pivots are 1.

The pivots are the only non-zero entry in their respective columns.

Then, if the system of equations has one unique solution, the resulting augmented matrix will look like (I|x),{\displaystyle (I|{\mathbf {x} }),} where I{\displaystyle I} is the identity matrix. This is our end goal for this part.


, Unlike obtaining row-echelon form, there is not a systematic process by which we identify pivots and row-reduce accordingly. We just have to do it. It is helpful to simplify before proceeding, however - we can divide row 4 by 4. Doing so makes the arithmetic easier. 


(112010−3−4−2−400−171700049){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&1&2&0&1\\0&-3&-4&-2&-4\\0&0&-1&7&17\\0&0&0&4&9\end{array}}\right)}


,


R3→7R4−4R3{\displaystyle R_{3}\to 7R_{4}-4R_{3}}


(112010−3−4−2−40040−500049){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&1&2&0&1\\0&-3&-4&-2&-4\\0&0&4&0&-5\\0&0&0&4&9\end{array}}\right)}


,


R2→R3+R2,{\displaystyle R_{2}\to R_{3}+R_{2},} then R2→R4+2R2.{\displaystyle R_{2}\to R_{4}+2R_{2}.} Then simplify the second row.


(112010−200−30040−500049){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&1&2&0&1\\0&-2&0&0&-3\\0&0&4&0&-5\\0&0&0&4&9\end{array}}\right)}


,


R1→2R1+R2,{\displaystyle R_{1}\to 2R_{1}+R_{2},} then R1→2R1−R3.{\displaystyle R_{1}\to 2R_{1}-R_{3}.}


(200040−200−30040−500049){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}2&0&0&0&4\\0&-2&0&0&-3\\0&0&4&0&-5\\0&0&0&4&9\end{array}}\right)}


,


(1000201003/20010−5/400019/4){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{cccc|c}1&0&0&0&2\\0&1&0&0&3/2\\0&0&1&0&-5/4\\0&0&0&1&9/4\end{array}}\right)}

This is RREF, and as expected, it immediately gives us the solution to our original equation as (I|x).{\displaystyle (I|{\mathbf {x} }).} We are now done.


x1=2x2=3/2x3=−5/4x4=9/4{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{1}&=2\\x_{2}&=3/2\\x_{3}&=-5/4\\x_{4}&=9/4\end{aligned}}}


, The example we went through above had one unique solution. In this part, we go through cases where you encounter a row of 0's in the coefficient matrix.  

After row-reducing as best as you can to row-echelon form, you may encounter a matrix similar to below. The important part is the row with the 0's, but also notice that we lack a pivot in the third row.


(14210−4−140001){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&4&2&1\\0&-4&-1&4\\0&0&0&1\end{array}}\right)}

That row of 0's says that the linear combination of the variables with coefficients of 0 add up to 1. This is never true, so the system is inconsistent and has no solution. If you reach this point, you are done.


, Perhaps in the row of 0's, the constant element in that row is also a 0, like so:


(14210−4−140000){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&4&2&1\\0&-4&-1&4\\0&0&0&0\end{array}}\right)}

This signals the presence of a dependent solution - a solution set with infinitely many solutions. Some may ask you to stop here, but not every x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} is a solution. To see what the actual solution is, row-reduce to RREF.


(1015011/4−10000){\displaystyle \left({\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&0&1&5\\0&1&1/4&-1\\0&0&0&0\end{array}}\right)}

The third column lacks a pivot after reducing to RREF, so what does this matrix say exactly? Remember that the pivot ""assigns"" a row to that variable as its equation, so since the first two rows have pivots, we can identify x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} and x2.{\displaystyle x_{2}.}


x1+x3=5x2+14x3=−1{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{1}+x_{3}&=5\\x_{2}+{\frac {1}{4}}x_{3}&=-1\end{aligned}}}



The first equation is the equation for x1,{\displaystyle x_{1},} while the second equation is the one for x2.{\displaystyle x_{2}.} Now, solve for both.


x1=5−x3x2=−1−14x3{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{1}&=5-x_{3}\\x_{2}&=-1-{\frac {1}{4}}x_{3}\end{aligned}}}



This is where ""dependency"" comes from. Both x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} and x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} rely on x3,{\displaystyle x_{3},} but x3{\displaystyle x_{3}} is arbitrary here - it is a free variable. No matter what it is, the resulting pair of x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} and x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} will be a valid solution to the system. To account for this, reparameterize the free variable by setting x3=t.{\displaystyle x_{3}=t.}


x1=5−tx2=−1−14t{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{1}&=5-t\\x_{2}&=-1-{\frac {1}{4}}t\end{aligned}}}



Of course, plugging in a value for t{\displaystyle t} and presenting the resulting x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} as a solution does not give the general solution. Rather, the general solution is


x=(5−t−1−14tt),t∈R.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }={\begin{pmatrix}5-t\\-1-{\frac {1}{4}}t\\t\end{pmatrix}},t\in {\mathbb {R} }.}



In general, you may encounter n{\displaystyle n} free variables. In this case, all that is required is that you reparameterize n{\displaystyle n} dependent variables.

x1′=3x1+5x2x2′=x1−x2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x_{1}'&=3x_{1}+5x_{2}\\x_{2}'&=x_{1}-x_{2}\end{aligned}}}



We consider the variables x1=x1(t){\displaystyle x_{1}=x_{1}(t)} and x2=x2(t){\displaystyle x_{2}=x_{2}(t)} and their respective derivatives to be functions of t.{\displaystyle t.}

From linear algebra, any system of equations such as this one can be written in matrix form x′=Ax.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }'=A{\mathbf {x} }.} In general, one also considers a forcing term b(t){\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }(t)} which may or may not be time-dependent, but in this section, we focus only on the homogeneous case where this term is 0.


(x1′x2′)=(351−1)(x1x2){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}x_{1}'\\x_{2}'\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}3&5\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}x_{1}\\x_{2}\end{pmatrix}}}

,

First, we find the characteristic equation det⁡(A−λI)=0.{\displaystyle \operatorname {det} (A-\lambda I)=0.} A useful formula for finding the characteristic equation of a 2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2} matrix is λ2−Tr⁡(A)λ+det⁡(A)=0{\displaystyle \lambda ^{2}-\operatorname {Tr} (A)\lambda +\operatorname {det} (A)=0}, where Tr{\displaystyle \operatorname {Tr} } denotes the trace of the matrix, the sum of the main diagonal elements.


|3−λ51−1−λ|=λ2−2λ−8=0{\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}3-\lambda &5\\1&-1-\lambda \end{vmatrix}}=\lambda ^{2}-2\lambda -8=0}



Solve for the eigenvalues. This quadratic equation can be factored. In general, use the quadratic formula. In this article, we label the two eigenvalues as λ1{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}} and λ2.{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}.}


λ1=4{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}=4}


λ2=−2{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}=-2}




, 


The eigenvalues are real and distinct. From linear algebra, finding the eigenvectors in this case is easy, as the eigenvectors should span the space with a dimension equal to the dimension of the matrix. Our example has two real and distinct eigenvalues, which we solve in the next section.


The eigenvalues are complex. We only need to deal with one eigenvector for reasons we discuss later.


The eigenvalues are degenerate. (They have multiplicity of order 2 or higher.) It is sometimes the case that degenerate eigenvalues of a matrix end up having eigenvectors that span a space with dimension equal to the degeneracy (multiplicity) of the eigenvalue. For example, an eigenvalue with degeneracy two may end up having two linearly independent eigenvectors. However, it is also entirely possible that the degenerate eigenvalue has an eigenspace that fails to span with a dimension equal to the degeneracy. In order to rectify this situation, we must introduce the concept of generalized eigenvectors, discussed later.


, To do so, substitute an eigenvalue into the matrix A−λI{\displaystyle A-\lambda I} and row-reduce. For 2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2} matrices, the second row is always a linear combination of the first row, and so the row-reduction is trivial. For higher dimensional matrices, the linear dependence of the rows (and columns!) is less obvious. 


λ1=4: (−151−5)→(−1500){\displaystyle \lambda _{1}=4:\ {\begin{pmatrix}-1&5\\1&-5\end{pmatrix}}\to {\begin{pmatrix}-1&5\\0&0\end{pmatrix}}}

This matrix tells us that −x1=−5x2.{\displaystyle -x_{1}=-5x_{2}.} Setting x2=t{\displaystyle x_{2}=t} to be a free variable, we see that x1=5t.{\displaystyle x_{1}=5t.} Because t{\displaystyle t} can be set to anything, we opt to set t=1{\displaystyle t=1} for convenience and arrive at the eigenvector v1=(51).{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }_{1}={\begin{pmatrix}5\\1\end{pmatrix}}.}

We do this with all other eigenvalues as well. Therefore, the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue λ2=−2{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}=-2} is v2=(−11).{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }_{2}={\begin{pmatrix}-1\\1\end{pmatrix}}.}


, Below, c1{\displaystyle c_{1}} and c2{\displaystyle c_{2}} are arbitrary constants.


x=c1e4t(51)+c2e−2t(−11){\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=c_{1}e^{4t}{\begin{pmatrix}5\\1\end{pmatrix}}+c_{2}e^{-2t}{\begin{pmatrix}-1\\1\end{pmatrix}}}

In general, we have eigenvalues λ1{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}} and λ2,{\displaystyle \lambda _{2},} with their corresponding eigenvectors.


x=c1eλ1tv1+c2eλ2tv2{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=c_{1}e^{\lambda _{1}t}{\mathbf {v} }_{1}+c_{2}e^{\lambda _{2}t}{\mathbf {v} }_{2}}




, 

The fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees that, for polynomial equations with real coefficients, the solutions are real numbers or come in complex conjugates. This implies that if λ=a+bi{\displaystyle \lambda =a+bi} is a solution to the characteristic equation, then λ∗=a−bi{\displaystyle \lambda ^{*}=a-bi} is also a solution. 

Similarly, if v{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }} is the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue λ,{\displaystyle \lambda ,} then v∗{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }^{*}} is an eigenvector associated with eigenvalue λ∗.{\displaystyle \lambda ^{*}.}

The solution to the system of differential equations can therefore be written out as a linear combination of the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue λ.{\displaystyle \lambda .} This is why we only need to deal with one eigenvalue.

Let's consider a system with matrix A=(2−51−2).{\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}2&-5\\1&-2\end{pmatrix}}.} This matrix has eigenvalues of λ=±i.{\displaystyle \lambda =\pm i.}


, We still row-reduce here just as with the real and distinct eigenvalue case, but the complex numbers mean that it is no longer immediately obvious that there exists linear dependency between the rows and columns. Nevertheless, if our work is correct, it is guaranteed that there be linear dependence, so for 2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2} matrices, we can again row-reduce trivially. Here, we first swap rows, and then row-reduce. We then set x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} as a free variable, solve for x1,{\displaystyle x_{1},} and set t=1{\displaystyle t=1} for convenience, just as before.


λ=i: (2−i−51−2−i)→(1−2−i00){\displaystyle \lambda =i:\ {\begin{pmatrix}2-i&-5\\1&-2-i\end{pmatrix}}\to {\begin{pmatrix}1&-2-i\\0&0\end{pmatrix}}}


v=(2+i1){\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }={\begin{pmatrix}2+i\\1\end{pmatrix}}}


, This first term is analogous to the form of the solution where the eigenvalues are both real and distinct. In general, we would have eλt=e(a+bi)t{\displaystyle e^{\lambda t}=e^{(a+bi)t}} as the exponential.


eitv{\displaystyle e^{it}{\mathbf {v} }}


, In general, our eigenvalue is of the form λ=a+bi,{\displaystyle \lambda =a+bi,} so we would also have a real exponential out in front.


eit=cos⁡t+isin⁡t{\displaystyle e^{it}=\cos t+i\sin t}


(cos⁡t+isin⁡t)(2+i1){\displaystyle (\cos t+i\sin t){\begin{pmatrix}2+i\\1\end{pmatrix}}}


, Remember that i2=−1.{\displaystyle i^{2}=-1.}


(cos⁡t+isin⁡t)(2+i1)=(2cos⁡t+2isin⁡t+icos⁡t−sin⁡tcos⁡t+isin⁡t){\displaystyle (\cos t+i\sin t){\begin{pmatrix}2+i\\1\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}2\cos t+2i\sin t+i\cos t-\sin t\\\cos t+i\sin t\end{pmatrix}}}


, The general solution is the linear combination of the real and imaginary parts of this vector.


x=c1(2cos⁡t−sin⁡tcos⁡t)+c2(2sin⁡t+cos⁡tsin⁡t){\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=c_{1}{\begin{pmatrix}2\cos t-\sin t\\\cos t\end{pmatrix}}+c_{2}{\begin{pmatrix}2\sin t+\cos t\\\sin t\end{pmatrix}}}


, As mentioned previously, it is sometimes the case that there are n{\displaystyle n} linearly independent eigenvectors associated with an eigenvalue of degeneracy of order n.{\displaystyle n.} This always occurs when the matrix A{\displaystyle A} is Hermitian. If this is the case, then proceed to solve the system according to the real and distinct eigenvalues case. If not, then continue here.

Consider the matrix A=(31−4−1).{\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}3&1\\-4&-1\end{pmatrix}}.} This matrix has eigenvalue λ=1{\displaystyle \lambda =1} with degeneracy of order 2. Using the methods outlined in previous sections, we find that there exists only one eigenvector v=(−12).{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }={\begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}}.} 

Our eigenspace fails to span the space of dimension 2. This is a problem. Recall that the general solution to a second order differential equation with repeated roots in its characteristic equation involved multiplying a term by t{\displaystyle t} in order to achieve linear independence. If we substitute this solution x=teλta{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=te^{\lambda t}{\mathbf {a} }} as an ansatz, we obtain a system of equations, one of which, a=0,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }=0,} is untenable with the requirement that an eigenvector be non-zero. One of the solutions must therefore include another vector w{\displaystyle {\mathbf {w} }} which we find momentarily.


, 

The Cayley-Hamilton theorem says that every matrix satisfies its own characteristic polynomial. That is, if p(λ){\displaystyle p(\lambda )} is a characteristic polynomial in λ,{\displaystyle \lambda ,} then replacing λ{\displaystyle \lambda } with the matrix A{\displaystyle A} itself must give the zero matrix. (Try it for the matrix above.) 

This is a deep result implying that every vector space must be spanned by a linear combination of the eigenvectors v{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }} and the generalized eigenvectors w.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {w} }.}  So even though these generalized eigenvectors are not eigenvectors of A,{\displaystyle A,} i.e. they do not lie in the null space of A−λI,{\displaystyle A-\lambda I,} they can be chosen such that they lie in the null space of (A−λI)2.{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I)^{2}.} (Hence, generalized.) In general, they may lie in the null space of (A−λI)n,{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I)^{n},} for an eigenvalue with degeneracy of order n.{\displaystyle n.}


, We know that (A−λI)2w=0.{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I)^{2}{\mathbf {w} }=0.} Then it follows that, since (A−λI)v=0,{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I){\mathbf {v} }=0,} we obtain the following important relation. This is the formula to find the generalized eigenvector given an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of degeneracy 2. This formula is shown to work if we act both sides by A−λI.{\displaystyle A-\lambda I.} 


(A−λI)w=v{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I){\mathbf {w} }={\mathbf {v} }}


, Solving this with row-reduction for the 2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2} case is again trivial. Setting a free variable w2=t{\displaystyle w_{2}=t} and setting it to 0 for convenience, we have the generalized eigenvector below.


w=(−1/20){\displaystyle {\mathbf {w} }={\begin{pmatrix}-1/2\\0\end{pmatrix}}}


, The general solution to our system is given below.


x=c1et(−12)+c2(tet(−12)+et(−1/20)){\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=c_{1}e^{t}{\begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}}+c_{2}\left(te^{t}{\begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}}+e^{t}{\begin{pmatrix}-1/2\\0\end{pmatrix}}\right)}

In general, we have the following formula.


x=c1eλtv+c2(teλtv+eλtw){\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=c_{1}e^{\lambda t}{\mathbf {v} }+c_{2}\left(te^{\lambda t}{\mathbf {v} }+e^{\lambda t}{\mathbf {w} }\right)}



In each of these cases, one obtains two arbitrary constants c1{\displaystyle c_{1}} and c2.{\displaystyle c_{2}.} Given initial conditions when t=0,{\displaystyle t=0,} one can easily solve for the constants. What will result is a system of algebraic equations.


, Recall that, if the variables x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} and A{\displaystyle A} were scalars, then the solution to this differential equation would be ceat.{\displaystyle ce^{at}.} So the solution to x′=Ax{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }'=A{\mathbf {x} }} is in the form of a matrix exponential, up to a constant.


eAt=I+(At)+(At)22!+(At)33!+⋯{\displaystyle e^{At}=I+(At)+{\frac {(At)^{2}}{2!}}+{\frac {(At)^{3}}{3!}}+\cdots }

Given initial conditions x(0)=x0,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }(0)={\mathbf {x} }_{0},} the solution is x=eAtx0.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=e^{At}{\mathbf {x} }_{0}.}


, For distinct (real and complex) eigenvalues, one can use the formulas given below, where eAt=eλ1tB+eλ2tC.{\displaystyle e^{At}=e^{\lambda _{1}t}B+e^{\lambda _{2}t}C.} These formulas have the advantage of not needing to care about the eigenvectors.


B=A−λ2Iλ1−λ2,  C=I−B{\displaystyle B={\frac {A-\lambda _{2}I}{\lambda _{1}-\lambda _{2}}},\ \ C=I-B}

However, finding the matrix exponential is made easier through diagonalization A=PDP−1,{\displaystyle A=PDP^{-1},} where P{\displaystyle P} is the change of basis matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A,{\displaystyle A,} and D{\displaystyle D} has the eigenvalues of A{\displaystyle A} along its main diagonal in the same order as their corresponding eigenvectors in P.{\displaystyle P.}


, 

Consider the matrix (351−1).{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}3&5\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}}.} To diagonalize, we find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. D{\displaystyle D} has the eigenvalues on the main diagonal. P{\displaystyle P} has the eigenvectors as its columns. The order of the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues must match!


(351−1)=16(5−111)(400−2)(11−15){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}3&5\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}}={\frac {1}{6}}{\begin{pmatrix}5&-1\\1&1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}4&0\\0&-2\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\-1&5\end{pmatrix}}}




, The advantage of diagonalization is that diagonal matrices are easier to work with. Here, taking the exponential of a diagonal matrix is equivalent to taking the exponential of the individual elements of the matrix eAt=PeDtP−1.{\displaystyle e^{At}=Pe^{Dt}P^{-1}.}


eAt=16(5−111)(e4t00e−2t)(11−15)=16(5e4t+e−2t5e4t−5e−2te4t−e−2te4t+5e−2t){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}e^{At}&={\frac {1}{6}}{\begin{pmatrix}5&-1\\1&1\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}e^{4t}&0\\0&e^{-2t}\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\-1&5\end{pmatrix}}\\&={\frac {1}{6}}{\begin{pmatrix}5e^{4t}+e^{-2t}&5e^{4t}-5e^{-2t}\\e^{4t}-e^{-2t}&e^{4t}+5e^{-2t}\end{pmatrix}}\end{aligned}}}

If we include the constant vector c,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {c} },} we can disregard the extra 1/6{\displaystyle 1/6} factor out front. Although this solution may not look like the solution we found previously, it is equivalent if we make the transformation c1+c2→c1{\displaystyle c_{1}+c_{2}\to c_{1}} and −c1+5c2→c2.{\displaystyle -c_{1}+5c_{2}\to c_{2}.} Thus, if eAt{\displaystyle e^{At}} is found, then your work is pretty much over.


, Once again, if it so happens that you find degenerate eigenvalues and the matrix is still diagonalizable, then all is well and you can proceed to find eAt{\displaystyle e^{At}} the normal way. 
, To begin, we write the series expansion for eAt.{\displaystyle e^{At}.}


eAt=e(A−λI)t+λIt=eλtI(I+(A−λI)t+(A−λI)22!)⋯{\displaystyle e^{At}=e^{(A-\lambda I)t+\lambda It}=e^{\lambda t}I\left(I+(A-\lambda I)t+{\frac {(A-\lambda I)^{2}}{2!}}\right)\cdots }

We can use the series expansion exactly because the matrix (A−λI)2{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I)^{2}} is nilpotent - that is, the matrix to some power is 0. In our case, A−λI{\displaystyle A-\lambda I} has nilpotency 2, so the Taylor series truncates to first order, giving us the relation below.


eAt=eλt(I+(A−λI)t){\displaystyle e^{At}=e^{\lambda t}(I+(A-\lambda I)t)}



In general, one would start from the series again and truncate based on the degeneracy of the eigenvalue and to what extent the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue fails to span the space of dimension equal to the degeneracy of the eigenvalue.


,

Consider the matrix (100020022).{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&2&0\\0&2&2\end{pmatrix}}.} Since this is a triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are read off the main diagonal. We find eigenvector (100){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}}} corresponding to eigenvalue λ=1{\displaystyle \lambda =1} and eigenvector (001){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}}} corresponding to degenerate eigenvalue λ=2.{\displaystyle \lambda =2.} 

To find the generalized eigenvector, we have (A−λI)2=(−100000000).{\displaystyle (A-\lambda I)^{2}={\begin{pmatrix}-1&0&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}}.} We can set either x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} or x3{\displaystyle x_{3}} as free variables. By setting one of them, we obtain a redundant solution, but the other one is the generalized eigenvector we are looking for: (010).{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}}.}


, A{\displaystyle A} is not diagonalizable, but there exists a matrix P{\displaystyle P} such that A=PJP−1,{\displaystyle A=PJP^{-1},} where J{\displaystyle J} is the Jordan normal form. J{\displaystyle J} is ""almost"" diagonal in the sense that it is identical to D{\displaystyle D} but also requires us to put a 1 directly above the eigenvalue corresponding to the generalized eigenvector within P.{\displaystyle P.} One can do the computation J=P−1AP{\displaystyle J=P^{-1}AP} to confirm that this is the case.


A=(100001010)(100021002)(100001010){\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&0&1\\0&1&0\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&2&1\\0&0&2\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&0&1\\0&1&0\end{pmatrix}}}


, Analogous to introducing an additional t{\displaystyle t} in the solution to a constant coefficient linear differential equation with repeated roots in its characteristic equation, one needs to introduce a term deλtdλ{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }e^{\lambda t}}{{\mathrm {d} }\lambda }}} corresponding to the off-diagonal element in J.{\displaystyle J.} As the degeneracy goes up, more derivatives need to be taken in succession going up the column.


eAt=P(et000e2tte2t00e2t)P−1{\displaystyle e^{At}=P{\begin{pmatrix}e^{t}&0&0\\0&e^{2t}&te^{2t}\\0&0&e^{2t}\end{pmatrix}}P^{-1}}

Arrive at the general solution to the differential equation.",How to Solve Linear Differential Equations Using the Method of Undetermined Coefficients," The complementary function, as mentioned, is the solution to the corresponding homogeneous differential equation. All solutions to these types of differential equations will contain exponentials of the form erx,{\displaystyle e^{rx},} where r{\displaystyle r} is the (in general) complex root of the characteristic equation. If the root contains an imaginary component, then the solution in terms of real arguments will also contain cosines and sines, per Euler's formula.

, If we can write out a linear combination involving a finite number of linearly independent derivatives, then we can use the method of undetermined coefficients to solve the inhomogeneous differential equation. Otherwise, we must use variation of parameters.

In practice, functions of the form a,xn,sin⁡ax,{\displaystyle a,\,x^{n},\,\sin ax,} and cos⁡ax{\displaystyle \cos ax} (where a{\displaystyle a} is a constant) have a finite number of linearly independent derivatives, while functions such as 1xn,tan⁡x,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x^{n}}},\,\tan x,} and sin⁡(e−x){\displaystyle \sin(e^{-x})} contain an infinite number of linearly independent derivatives.


, From here, there are three possible scenarios.

None of the terms are the same.

The particular solution yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will then only consist of a linear combination of the terms of Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} and their linearly independent derivatives. 




Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} contains a term h(x){\displaystyle h(x)} that is xn{\displaystyle x^{n}} times a term in yc,{\displaystyle y_{c},} where n{\displaystyle n} is 0 or a positive integer, but this term originated from a distinct root of the characteristic equation. 

In this case, yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will consist of a term xn+1h(x),{\displaystyle x^{n+1}h(x),} its linearly independent derivatives, as well as the other terms of Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} and their linearly independent derivatives. The only thing changed from the previous scenario is what to do with the ""duplicate"" term.




Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} contains a term h(x){\displaystyle h(x)} that is xn{\displaystyle x^{n}} times a term in yc,{\displaystyle y_{c},} but this term originated from a repeated root of the characteristic equation. 


yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} is identical to the previous two scenarios, except yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will consist of a term xn+sh(x){\displaystyle x^{n+s}h(x)} (where s{\displaystyle s} denotes the root's multiplicity) and its linearly independent derivatives, as well as the other distinct terms of Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} and their linearly independent derivatives. 




, The coefficients in this linear combination are why this method is called the method of undetermined coefficients. If in the process of finding the linearly independent derivatives, terms that are in yc{\displaystyle y_{c}} show up, you can disregard them in yp,{\displaystyle y_{p},} as the arbitrary constants in yc{\displaystyle y_{c}} take care of those terms for you.
, Evaluate the derivatives. 
, In general, this will be a system of linear equations. But typically, many of these are trivial, as terms will immediately evaluate to 0. 
, After going through one of the scenarios and determining the coefficients, the sum y=yc+yp{\displaystyle y=y_{c}+y_{p}} denotes the general solution. This is easy to prove. If yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} is a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation, then adding yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} with yc{\displaystyle y_{c}} doesn't affect Q(x).{\displaystyle Q(x).}

Initial conditions works the same way as with any other differential equation. After finding the general solution, simply plug in initial conditions and solve for the constants. It is important, however, to recognize the difference between the particular solution yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} that came about from Q(x),{\displaystyle Q(x),} and the particular solution that follows after using the initial conditions to solve for the arbitrary constants, as they refer to different things. 


, This is an inhomogeneous linear second order differential equation with a Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} consisting of terms with finitely many linearly independent derivatives, meaning that the method of undetermined coefficients is ideal for solving this equation.


d2ydx2−3dydx+2y=xe−x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}-3{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+2y=xe^{-x}}


, The complementary solution is the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation, where we set the right side to 0. In this example, there are no double roots.


yc=c1e2x+c2ex{\displaystyle y_{c}=c_{1}e^{2x}+c_{2}e^{x}}


, First, we check to see if any terms in Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} are xn{\displaystyle x^{n}} times a term in yc,{\displaystyle y_{c},} up to multiplicative constants. As none of the terms are the same, yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will only consist of a linear combination of Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} and its linearly independent derivatives.


yp=Axe−x+Be−x{\displaystyle y_{p}=Axe^{-x}+Be^{-x}}


, Substitute these into the differential equation.


dypdx=(A−B)e−x−Axe−x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y_{p}}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=(A-B)e^{-x}-Axe^{-x}}


d2ypdx2=(−2A+B)e−x+Axex{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y_{p}}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}=(-2A+B)e^{-x}+Axe^{x}}


(−5A+6B)e−x+6Axe−x=xe−x{\displaystyle (-5A+6B)e^{-x}+6Axe^{-x}=xe^{-x}}


, We can immediately see that A=16.{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{6}}.} Plugging into the other equation −5A+6B=0{\displaystyle -5A+6B=0} nets us B=536.{\displaystyle B={\frac {5}{36}}.}
, Notice that these coefficients resulted in a slightly nonintuitive answer, which reflects the importance of including the derivatives of Q(x){\displaystyle Q(x)} in yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} while using this method.


yp=16xe−x+536e−x{\displaystyle y_{p}={\frac {1}{6}}xe^{-x}+{\frac {5}{36}}e^{-x}}


, Combine yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} with yc.{\displaystyle y_{c}.}


y=c1e2x+c2ex+16xe−x+536e−x{\displaystyle y=c_{1}e^{2x}+c_{2}e^{x}+{\frac {1}{6}}xe^{-x}+{\frac {5}{36}}e^{-x}}

d2ydx2+dydx=x+sin⁡2x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=x+\sin 2x}


,


yc=c1+c2e−x{\displaystyle y_{c}=c_{1}+c_{2}e^{-x}}


, We see that x{\displaystyle x} is x1{\displaystyle x^{1}} times the term c1.{\displaystyle c_{1}.} Therefore, yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will consist of x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} and its linearly independent derivatives, as well as sin⁡2x{\displaystyle \sin 2x} and cos⁡2x.{\displaystyle \cos 2x.} Remember, when constructing the linear combination, we disregard all multiplicative constants.


yp=Ax2+Bx+C+Dsin⁡2x+Ecos⁡2x{\displaystyle y_{p}=Ax^{2}+Bx+C+D\sin 2x+E\cos 2x}


, Substitute these into the differential equation.


dypdx=2Ax+B+2Dcos⁡2x−2Esin⁡2x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y_{p}}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=2Ax+B+2D\cos 2x-2E\sin 2x}

, We can immediately see that A=12{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}} and 2A+B=0,{\displaystyle 2A+B=0,} so B=−1.{\displaystyle B=-1.} C{\displaystyle C} is not even present, so C=0.{\displaystyle C=0.} Furthermore, since D{\displaystyle D} and E{\displaystyle E} are coupled, they can be solved on their own.

,


anrnerx+an−1rn−1erx+⋯+a1rerx+a0erx=0{\displaystyle a_{n}r^{n}e^{rx}+a_{n-1}r^{n-1}e^{rx}+\cdots +a_{1}re^{rx}+a_{0}e^{rx}=0} 


, The resulting equation inside the parentheses is called the characteristic equation of the differential equation with constant coefficients. Using our trial solution, we have converted a differential equation into an algebraic equation. Now, our task is to find the roots of the characteristic equation.


anrn+an−1rn−1+⋯+a1r+a0=0{\displaystyle a_{n}r^{n}+a_{n-1}r^{n-1}+\cdots +a_{1}r+a_{0}=0}

Per the fundamental theorem of algebra, every polynomial of order n{\displaystyle n} has at least one and not more than n{\displaystyle n} distinct complex roots. There are therefore three possible scenarios after solving the characteristic equation. 


, The existence and uniqueness theorem for homogeneous linear differential equations tells us two very important things. First, such an nth order equation has n{\displaystyle n} linearly independent solutions y1,y2,⋯,yn.{\displaystyle y_{1},\,y_{2},\cdots ,\,y_{n}.} Second, the linear combination of those solutions is also a solution of the equation. Once we have found the roots, we do not need to search for any more solutions. Below, we label the roots rk{\displaystyle r_{k}} and their respective arbitrary constants ck,{\displaystyle c_{k},} where k{\displaystyle k} is going from 1 to n.{\displaystyle n.}


y=c1er1x+c2er2x+⋯+cnernx{\displaystyle y=c_{1}e^{r_{1}x}+c_{2}e^{r_{2}x}+\cdots +c_{n}e^{r_{n}x}}

The reason why we do not need to search for more solutions is because solutions to the differential equation form a linearly independent spanning set (basis) in polynomial space with dimension n.{\displaystyle n.} So after finding all the basis elements, every other function in the vector space can be written in terms of the basis elements.


, We face a dilemma here. The existence and uniqueness theorem tells us that there should be n{\displaystyle n} linearly independent solutions. But we can clearly see that if a root is repeated and we naively present the above equation as the general solution, the functions are linearly dependent, and therefore it cannot be the general solution. Since there must be n{\displaystyle n} linearly independent solutions, we need to find u{\displaystyle u} such that y{\displaystyle y} is the general solution of the differential equation. 
, To make things simpler for us (because of the repeated use of the product rule), we will consider a second order differential equation only. The constant coefficients are there to make the result turn out nicely.


d2dx2uerx−2rddxuerx+r2uerx=0erxd2udx2=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}ue^{rx}-2r{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}ue^{rx}+r^{2}ue^{rx}&=0\\e^{rx}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}u}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}&=0\end{aligned}}}

After factoring out erx{\displaystyle e^{rx}} and simplifying, everything in parentheses vanishes except for the highest ordered derivative. We recognize here that erx{\displaystyle e^{rx}} is never 0, so d2udx2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}u}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}} must be.


,


y=c1+c2x{\displaystyle y=c_{1}+c_{2}x}

In the general nth order equation, it turns out that y=ckxk−1{\displaystyle y=c_{k}x^{k-1}} for k{\displaystyle k} going from 1 to n{\displaystyle n} holds. Multiply it by erx,{\displaystyle e^{rx},} and we have a linearly independent solution. It is easy to verify this by taking the Wronskian and confirming that the determinant does not vanish.


|c1erxc2xerxc1rerxc2erx+c2xrerx|≠0{\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}c_{1}e^{rx}&c_{2}xe^{rx}\\c_{1}re^{rx}&c_{2}e^{rx}+c_{2}xre^{rx}\end{vmatrix}}\neq 0}




, For second order equations, the solution only differs from the real and distinct roots solution by an extra x,{\displaystyle x,} something that can either be forgotten or be nonintuitive. It is important that you recognize that this method only refers to repeated roots. That is, if a characteristic equation yielded something like (r−3)(r−2)2=0,{\displaystyle (r-3)(r-2)^{2}=0,} the solution to the corresponding differential equation would be y=c1e3x+(c2+c3x)e2x.{\displaystyle y=c_{1}e^{3x}+(c_{2}+c_{3}x)e^{2x}.}


y=erx(c1+c2x+⋯+cnxn−1){\displaystyle y=e^{rx}(c_{1}+c_{2}x+\cdots +c_{n}x^{n-1})}


, We know that complex roots of polynomials come in conjugate pairs. That is, if r1=α+iβ{\displaystyle r_{1}=\alpha +i\beta } is a root, then so is r2=α−iβ.{\displaystyle r_{2}=\alpha -i\beta .} For sake of demonstration in this part, we will assume a second order differential equation with a characteristic equation that only contains complex roots.


y=c1~e(α+iβ)x+c2~e(α−iβ)x{\displaystyle y={\tilde {c_{1}}}e^{(\alpha +i\beta )x}+{\tilde {c_{2}}}e^{(\alpha -i\beta )x}}

While this is an acceptable way to write the solution, there is another, more common way to write it, which highlights the solutions' periodic nature in a clearer fashion.


, 


y=c1~eαxeiβx+c2~eαxe−iβx=eαx(c1~eiβx+c2~e−iβx)=eαx(c1~(cos⁡βx+isin⁡βx)+c2~(cos⁡βx−isin⁡βx))=eαx((c1~+c2~)cos⁡βx+i(c1~−c2~)sin⁡βx){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y&={\tilde {c_{1}}}e^{\alpha x}e^{i\beta x}+{\tilde {c_{2}}}e^{\alpha x}e^{-i\beta x}\\&=e^{\alpha x}({\tilde {c_{1}}}e^{i\beta x}+{\tilde {c_{2}}}e^{-i\beta x})\\&=e^{\alpha x}({\tilde {c_{1}}}(\cos \beta x+i\sin \beta x)+{\tilde {c_{2}}}(\cos \beta x-i\sin \beta x))\\&=e^{\alpha x}(({\tilde {c_{1}}}+{\tilde {c_{2}}})\cos \beta x+i({\tilde {c_{1}}}-{\tilde {c_{2}}})\sin \beta x)\end{aligned}}}


, c1=c1~+c2~{\displaystyle c_{1}={\tilde {c_{1}}}+{\tilde {c_{2}}}} and c2=i(c1~−c2~){\displaystyle c_{2}=i({\tilde {c_{1}}}-{\tilde {c_{2}}})} are appropriate here. Notice that if the roots of the characteristic equation are purely imaginary, then α=0{\displaystyle \alpha =0} and the solution is periodic with no damping or blowup. As with the repeated roots part, the method outlined in this part only refers to complex roots. If a characteristic equation yielded something like (r−2)(r−4)2(r−(2+i))(r−(2−i))=0,{\displaystyle (r-2)(r-4)^{2}(r-(2+i))(r-(2-i))=0,} then the general solution would be y=c1e2x+(c2+c3x)e4x+e2x(c4cos⁡x+c5sin⁡x).{\displaystyle y=c_{1}e^{2x}+(c_{2}+c_{3}x)e^{4x}+e^{2x}(c_{4}\cos x+c_{5}\sin x).}


y=eαx(c1cos⁡βx+c2sin⁡βx){\displaystyle y=e^{\alpha x}(c_{1}\cos \beta x+c_{2}\sin \beta x)}


, Although all the parameters in the above equation are real, it may be better in some scenarios to rewrite the solution with a phase factor ϕ.{\displaystyle \phi .}

Multiply the solution by c12+c22c12+c22.{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}.}


eαxc12+c22(c1c12+c22cos⁡βx+c2c12+c22sin⁡βx){\displaystyle e^{\alpha x}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}\left({\frac {c_{1}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}\cos \beta x+{\frac {c_{2}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}\sin \beta x\right)}



Draw a right triangle with angle ϕ,{\displaystyle \phi ,} hypotenuse length c12+c22,{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}},} opposite side length c1,{\displaystyle c_{1},} and adjacent side length c2.{\displaystyle c_{2}.} Replace the constant c12+c22{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}} with a new constant A.{\displaystyle A.} Now we can simplify the quantities in parentheses. The result is that the second arbitrary constant has been replaced with an angle. Because ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is arbitrary, we can also use the cosine function as well.


y=Aeαx(sin⁡ϕcos⁡βx+cos⁡ϕsin⁡βx)=Aeαxsin⁡(βx+ϕ){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y&=Ae^{\alpha x}(\sin \phi \cos \beta x+\cos \phi \sin \beta x)\\&=Ae^{\alpha x}\sin(\beta x+\phi )\end{aligned}}}

, r=−2{\displaystyle r=-2} is a double root.


(r+2)2=0{\displaystyle (r+2)^{2}=0}

From part 1, the general solution to the differential equation is as follows.


y=(c1+c2x)e−2x{\displaystyle y=(c_{1}+c_{2}x)e^{-2x}}



You can verify that this is a solution by taking derivatives and substituting into the differential equation.


, When a problem is given with initial conditions, they are asking you to find a particular solution to the differential equation. Notice that this equation is essentially saying to find all functions that are their own second derivatives.


d2ydx2−y=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}-y=0}


y(0)=1, y′(0)=0{\displaystyle y(0)=1,\ y^{\prime }(0)=0}

r=±1{\displaystyle r=\pm 1}


y=c1ex+c2e−x{\displaystyle y=c_{1}e^{x}+c_{2}e^{-x}}


, Since we are dealing with second order differential equations, we need to have two initial conditions in order for the solution to be unique. Once we have y{\displaystyle y} and its derivative, we can substitute.


{y=c1ex+c2e−xy′=c1ex−c2e−x{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}y&=c_{1}e^{x}+c_{2}e^{-x}\\y^{\prime }&=c_{1}e^{x}-c_{2}e^{-x}\end{cases}}}


{1=c1+c20=c1−c2{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}1&=c_{1}+c_{2}\\0&=c_{1}-c_{2}\end{cases}}}


,


c1=12, c2=12{\displaystyle c_{1}={\frac {1}{2}},\ c_{2}={\frac {1}{2}}}


, This function is a solution satisfying initial conditions, with the interesting property in that it is equal to its own second derivative. This function is, in fact, the hyperbolic cosine.


y=ex+e−x2=cosh⁡x{\displaystyle y={\frac {e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2}}=\cosh x}


, This object is resting on a frictionless floor, and the spring follows Hooke's law F=−kx.{\displaystyle F=-kx.}

Newton's second law says that the magnitude of a force is proportional to the object's acceleration F=ma.{\displaystyle F=ma.} When the spring is being pulled to an excited state, i.e. out of equilibrium, the object experiences a restoring force that tends to bring it back to equilibrium. At the instant the spring reaches its equilibrium point, however, the object is traveling at its greatest speed. The spring therefore undergoes an oscillatory motion, and because the floor is frictionless (no damping), it exhibits simple harmonic motion.

Newton's law only indirectly relates the position of an object to the force acting on it through a second derivative, because a=d2xdt2.{\displaystyle a={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}x}{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}.}


, The equation is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. In our system, the forces acting perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object (the weight of the object and the corresponding normal force) cancel out. Therefore, the only force acting on the object when the spring is excited is the restoring force. This means that we equate the two together.


F=ma=−kx{\displaystyle F=ma=-kx}

Rewrite acceleration in terms of position and rearrange terms to set the equation to 0.


d2xdt2+kmx=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}x}{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}+{\frac {k}{m}}x=0}




,

Set up the characteristic equation.


r2+km=0{\displaystyle r^{2}+{\frac {k}{m}}=0}



Find the roots of the characteristic equation.


r=±kmi{\displaystyle r=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}i}



Then, the solution to the differential equation is as follows.


x(t)=Acos(kmt+ϕ){\displaystyle x(t)=A\cos \left({\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}t+\phi \right)}



Each of the constants in the solution has physical significance. A{\displaystyle A} is the amplitude of the oscillation, and ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is the initial phase factor. Without initial conditions, this is as far as we can go.


, Our analysis will also include a force F=−bv,{\displaystyle F=-bv,} where b{\displaystyle b} is an experimentally determined constant. We recognize that velocity is the rate of change of position. The negative sign signifies that this force is always acting opposite to the direction of motion.


ma=−kx−bv{\displaystyle ma=-kx-bv}

Rewrite acceleration and velocity in terms of position and rearrange terms. This is once again a second-order differential equation with constant coefficients.


md2xdt2+bdxdt+kx=0{\displaystyle m{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}x}{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}+b{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}+kx=0}




,

Set up the characteristic equation.


mr2+br+k=0{\displaystyle mr^{2}+br+k=0}



Find the roots of the characteristic equation. We see that the roots are slightly more complicated than before, with the undamped motion example. We could write out our solution in terms of trigonometric functions, but it is no longer obvious that our roots are even complex anymore. 


r=−b±b2−4mk2m{\displaystyle r={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4mk}}}{2m}}}



We will see that all equations obeying some form of simple harmonic motion must satisfy the equation below. This is a standard form that simplifies the roots of the characteristic equation, aiding in our analysis. One only needs to substitute in β{\displaystyle \beta } (the attenuation, the measure of how quickly the system damps) and ω0{\displaystyle \omega _{0}} (the angular frequency) using the parameters originally defined in the problem and go from there. In our case, we have β=b/2m{\displaystyle \beta =b/2m} and ω02=k/m.{\displaystyle \omega _{0}^{2}=k/m.}


d2xdt2+2βdxdt+ω02x=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}x}{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}+2\beta {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}+\omega _{0}^{2}x=0}


r=−β±β2−ω02{\displaystyle r=-\beta \pm {\sqrt {\beta ^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}}}}



Remember that for the solution to be oscillatory in nature, the square root must be imaginary. So the condition for damped harmonic motion is that ω02>β2.{\displaystyle \omega _{0}^{2}>\beta ^{2}.} The general solution will then take on the following form. For some more information on this system, see this article.

, Using the properties of the Laplace transform, we can transform this constant coefficient differential equation into an algebraic equation.


s2Y−sy(0)−y′(0)+5(sY−y(0))+6Y=ss2+1s2Y−s+5sY−5+6Y=ss2+1{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s^{2}Y-sy(0)-y^{\prime }(0)+5(sY-y(0))+6Y&={\frac {s}{s^{2}+1}}\\s^{2}Y-s+5sY-5+6Y&={\frac {s}{s^{2}+1}}\end{aligned}}}


, Simplify and factor the denominator to prepare for partial fraction decomposition.


Y=ss2+1+s+5s2+5s+6=s(s2+1)(s+3)(s+2)+s+5(s+3)(s+2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Y&={\frac {{\frac {s}{s^{2}+1}}+s+5}{s^{2}+5s+6}}\\&={\frac {s}{(s^{2}+1)(s+3)(s+2)}}+{\frac {s+5}{(s+3)(s+2)}}\end{aligned}}}


, This process can be long-winded, but there are ways to streamline this process. Because partial fractions are inevitably going to show up while working in Laplace space, we will detail the entire process into solving for each coefficient.

First, let's work with the first fraction, the harder one. This fraction can be written in terms of four coefficients.


s(s2+1)(s+3)(s+2)=As+Bs2+1+Cs+3+Ds+2{\displaystyle {\frac {s}{(s^{2}+1)(s+3)(s+2)}}={\frac {As+B}{s^{2}+1}}+{\frac {C}{s+3}}+{\frac {D}{s+2}}}




C{\displaystyle C} and D{\displaystyle D} can easily be solved for. To solve for C,{\displaystyle C,} we multiply both sides by (s+3){\displaystyle (s+3)} and substitute s=−3.{\displaystyle s=-3.} By doing so, we will be evaluating the ""reduced fraction"" on the left, while C{\displaystyle C} on the right side becomes isolated as the other terms vanish. D{\displaystyle D} can be found in a similar manner. In general, such coefficients can be found by multiplying by the factor in the denominator and substituting that root. This is an excellent way to avoid solving a system of equations.


C=s(s2+1)(s+2)|s=−3=310{\displaystyle C={\frac {s}{(s^{2}+1)(s+2)}}{\Bigg |}_{s=-3}={\frac {3}{10}}}


D=s(s2+1)(s+3)|s=−2=−25{\displaystyle D={\frac {s}{(s^{2}+1)(s+3)}}{\Bigg |}_{s=-2}=-{\frac {2}{5}}}




B{\displaystyle B} can be found by multiplying both sides by (s2+1){\displaystyle (s^{2}+1)} and choosing s=0.{\displaystyle s=0.}


0=B+C3+D2{\displaystyle 0=B+{\frac {C}{3}}+{\frac {D}{2}}}


B=110{\displaystyle B={\frac {1}{10}}}




A{\displaystyle A} is a bit trickier to find. We first get rid of the denominators to both sides. Then, we recognize that A{\displaystyle A} is a coefficient of s3.{\displaystyle s^{3}.} The other s3{\displaystyle s^{3}} terms will have C{\displaystyle C} and D{\displaystyle D} in them. Now, notice that the left side has no cubic term. Therefore, we can say that A+C+D=0.{\displaystyle A+C+D=0.}


s=As(s+3)(s+2)+B(s+3)(s+2)+C(s+2)(s2+1)+D(s+3)(s2+1){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s=As(s+3)(s+2)&+B(s+3)(s+2)\\&+C(s+2)(s^{2}+1)\\&+D(s+3)(s^{2}+1)\end{aligned}}}


A=−C−D=110{\displaystyle A=-C-D={\frac {1}{10}}}



The same process in finding C{\displaystyle C} and D{\displaystyle D} can be used to find the coefficients of the partial fractions for the second fraction. In general, this idea of substituting, differentiating (for fractions with repeated roots), or equating coefficients can be used to efficiently find partial fraction decompositions. Of course, such efficiency takes practice, and if you need to double-check your work, going back to the system of equations is another option.


s+5(s+3)(s+2)=Es+3+Fs+2{\displaystyle {\frac {s+5}{(s+3)(s+2)}}={\frac {E}{s+3}}+{\frac {F}{s+2}}}


E=−2, F=3{\displaystyle E=-2,\ F=3}




, We now have the coefficients, so we can now simplify the solution.


Y=110s+1s2+1+3/10s+3+−2/5s+2+−2s+3+3s+2=110s+1s2+1+−17/10s+3+26/10s+2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Y&={\frac {1}{10}}{\frac {s+1}{s^{2}+1}}+{\frac {3/10}{s+3}}+{\frac {-2/5}{s+2}}+{\frac {-2}{s+3}}+{\frac {3}{s+2}}\\&={\frac {1}{10}}{\frac {s+1}{s^{2}+1}}+{\frac {-17/10}{s+3}}+{\frac {26/10}{s+2}}\end{aligned}}}


, Now, we can finally transform back from Laplace space. We are lucky because our terms are all written such that we can find the functions in physical space by looking at a table of Laplace transforms. In general, taking inverse Laplace transforms is no joke, and requires a fair bit of knowledge of complex analysis (the Bromwich integral is a contour integral typically done using residue theory).


y(t)=110cos⁡t+110sin⁡t−1710e−3t+135e−2t{\displaystyle y(t)={\frac {1}{10}}\cos t+{\frac {1}{10}}\sin t-{\frac {17}{10}}e^{-3t}+{\frac {13}{5}}e^{-2t}}


, In physics, the equation of an object undergoing simple harmonic motion with no resistance is given by mx¨+mω2x=0,{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+m\omega ^{2}x=0,} where ω{\displaystyle \omega } is the angular frequency of oscillation, and the number of dots specifies the number of derivatives (Newton's notation for derivatives). Of course, in real life, there will always be some form of resistance. In this example, the resistive force is assumed to be proportional to velocity F=−mβx˙,{\displaystyle F=-m\beta {\dot {x}},} where β{\displaystyle \beta } is a constant. Our initial conditions are a displacement of 1 from equilibrium at rest. By using Newton's second law, we can write the differential equation in the following manner. Notice that the presence of mass m{\displaystyle m} in each of the terms means that our solution must eventually be independent of m.{\displaystyle m.}


mx¨+2mβx˙+mω2x=0,  x(0)=1, x˙(0)=0{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+2m\beta {\dot {x}}+m\omega ^{2}x=0,\ \ x(0)=1,\ {\dot {x}}(0)=0}


x¨+2βx˙+ω2x=0{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}+2\beta {\dot {x}}+\omega ^{2}x=0}


,


s2X−s+2βsX−2β+ω2X=0{\displaystyle s^{2}X-s+2\beta sX-2\beta +\omega ^{2}X=0}


X(s)=s+2βs2+2βs+ω2{\displaystyle X(s)={\frac {s+2\beta }{s^{2}+2\beta s+\omega ^{2}}}}


, The purpose of this is to obtain a result from which we can look at a table of Laplace transforms and find the function in physical space by inspection. Of course, to compensate for the added β2{\displaystyle \beta ^{2}} term, we need to subtract that so that we are ""adding 0.""


X=s+2β(s+β)2+ω2−β2{\displaystyle X={\frac {s+2\beta }{(s+\beta )^{2}+\omega ^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}}


, From the numerator, it is obvious that this is going to be a sum of a cosine and sine term. From the (s+β)2{\displaystyle (s+\beta )^{2}} in the denominator, it is obvious that both of these terms will be multiplied by an exponential term (in fact, an exponential decay term e−βt{\displaystyle e^{-\beta t}}). In order to see the two contributions more clearly, we can rewrite the numerator as (s+β)+β.{\displaystyle (s+\beta )+\beta .}


x(t)=e−βtcos(ω2−β2t)+βω2−β2e−βtsin(ω2−β2t){\displaystyle x(t)=e^{-\beta t}\cos \left({\sqrt {\omega ^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}\,t\right)+{\frac {\beta }{\sqrt {\omega ^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}}e^{-\beta t}\sin \left({\sqrt {\omega ^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}\,t\right)}

This example has shown us that the method of Laplace transforms can be used to solve homogeneous differential equations with initial conditions without taking derivatives to solve the system of equations that results. However, it is a good idea to check your answer by solving the differential equation using the standard ansatz method.


, The previous example serves as a prelude for this more complicated problem. Now, we add a driving force F=Asin⁡ωt,{\displaystyle F=A\sin \omega t,} where A{\displaystyle A} is the amplitude and ω{\displaystyle \omega } is the frequency of the driving force. Our differential equation is now modified to be inhomogeneous with more general initial conditions. We denote ω0{\displaystyle \omega _{0}} to be the frequency of the oscillator free of the driving force.


x¨+2βx˙+ω02x=Asin⁡ωt,  x(0)=x0, x˙(0)=v0{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}+2\beta {\dot {x}}+\omega _{0}^{2}x=A\sin \omega t,\ \ x(0)=x_{0},\ {\dot {x}}(0)=v_{0}}


, We split the answer into two pieces. The first fraction is easy, and we will transform that back into physical space at the end of this problem. The second fraction is a bit more complicated (to say the least).


s2X−sx0−v0+2βsX−2βx0+ω02X=Aωs2+ω2{\displaystyle s^{2}X-sx_{0}-v_{0}+2\beta sX-2\beta x_{0}+\omega _{0}^{2}X={\frac {A\omega }{s^{2}+\omega ^{2}}}}


X(s)=sx0+2βx0+v0(s+β)2+ω02−β2+Aω((s+β)2+ω02−β2)(s2+ω2){\displaystyle X(s)={\frac {sx_{0}+2\beta x_{0}+v_{0}}{(s+\beta )^{2}+\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}+{\frac {A\omega }{((s+\beta )^{2}+\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2})(s^{2}+\omega ^{2})}}}


, Aω{\displaystyle A\omega } can be treated as a constant. Notice that B{\displaystyle B} is being multiplied by (s+β),{\displaystyle (s+\beta ),} which should be the case because the denominator contains a (s+β){\displaystyle (s+\beta )} term important for getting the e−βt{\displaystyle e^{-\beta t}} out when we transform back.


1((s+β)2+ω02−β2)(s2+ω2)=B(s+β)+C(s+β)2+ω02−β2+Ds+Es2+ω2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{((s+\beta )^{2}+\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2})(s^{2}+\omega ^{2})}}={\frac {B(s+\beta )+C}{(s+\beta )^{2}+\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}+{\frac {Ds+E}{s^{2}+\omega ^{2}}}}


, Equate the coefficients first.


1=B(s+β)(s2+ω2)+C(s2+ω2)+Ds((s+β)2+ω02−β2)+E((s+β)2+ω02−β2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1&=B(s+\beta )(s^{2}+\omega ^{2})+C(s^{2}+\omega ^{2})\\&+Ds((s+\beta )^{2}+\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2})+E((s+\beta )^{2}+\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2})\end{aligned}}}

From this result, we clearly see by equating the cubic terms s3,{\displaystyle s^{3},} we obtain B+D=0.{\displaystyle B+D=0.}


, Remember that s{\displaystyle s} is, in general, a complex number. Since s{\displaystyle s} is involved in a sum of squares, we recognize that if s{\displaystyle s} is purely imaginary, such a term will vanish. This causes both B{\displaystyle B} and C{\displaystyle C} to vanish. Then we obtain a system of equations because we can equate the real and imaginary components. This gets us D{\displaystyle D} and E{\displaystyle E} simultaneously. This also gets us B{\displaystyle B} because B=−D.{\displaystyle B=-D.}


1=Diω(ω02−ω2+2iωβ)+E(ω02−ω2+2iωβ){\displaystyle 1=Di\omega (\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}+2i\omega \beta )+E(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}+2i\omega \beta )}


{0=Dω(ω02−ω2)+2Eωβ1=E(ω02−ω2)−2Dω2β{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}0=D\omega (\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})+2E\omega \beta \\1=E(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})-2D\omega ^{2}\beta \end{cases}}}


E=ω02−ω2(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2{\displaystyle E={\frac {\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}}


D=−2β(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2{\displaystyle D={\frac {-2\beta }{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}}


B=2β(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2{\displaystyle B={\frac {2\beta }{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}}


, The reason for this is simple - B{\displaystyle B} vanishes, and the other terms simplify. Then substitute the results for D{\displaystyle D} and E.{\displaystyle E.} This coefficient is the most laborious to obtain, but the goal here is to write all terms on the right side in terms of (ω2+β2).{\displaystyle (\omega ^{2}+\beta ^{2}).}


1=C(β2+ω2)+(ω02−β2)(E−βD){\displaystyle 1=C(\beta ^{2}+\omega ^{2})+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2})(E-\beta D)}


C(β2+ω2)=1−(ω02−ω2+2β2)(ω02−β2)(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2=ω4+3ω2β2−ω2ω02−ω02β2+2β4(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2=(ω2+β2−β2)2+3(ω2+β2−β2)β2+2β4−ω02(ω2+β2)(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2=(ω2+β2)2+β2(ω2+β2)−ω02(ω2+β2)(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}C(\beta ^{2}+\omega ^{2})&=1-{\frac {(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}+2\beta ^{2})(\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2})}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}\\&={\frac {\omega ^{4}+3\omega ^{2}\beta ^{2}-\omega ^{2}\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}\beta ^{2}+2\beta ^{4}}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}\\&={\frac {(\omega ^{2}+\beta ^{2}-\beta ^{2})^{2}+3(\omega ^{2}+\beta ^{2}-\beta ^{2})\beta ^{2}+2\beta ^{4}-\omega _{0}^{2}(\omega ^{2}+\beta ^{2})}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}\\&={\frac {(\omega ^{2}+\beta ^{2})^{2}+\beta ^{2}(\omega ^{2}+\beta ^{2})-\omega _{0}^{2}(\omega ^{2}+\beta ^{2})}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}

, (Of course, transform back using the coefficients, not their explicit forms! Remember to multiply by Aω,{\displaystyle A\omega ,} since we omitted that when finding the coefficients.) This solution is fairly complicated, and it seems unusual that the simple addition of a sinusoidal driving force would end up complicating the motion to this degree. Unfortunately, this is what the math tells us. What we have found in this section is that, while the process of obtaining this solution took a lot of algebra, our only steps that involved some resemblance of calculus were the Laplace transforms both to and from Laplace space. The rest was simply finding the coefficients of the partial fractions. 


x(t)=x0e−βtcos(ω02−β2t)+βx0+v0ω02−β2e−βtsin(ω02−β2t)+2Aωβ(ω02−ω2)2+4ω2β2e−βtcos(ω02−β2t)+Aωω02−β2ω2−ω02+2β2(ω02−ω2)2+4ω2β2e−βtsin(ω02−β2t)+−2Aωβ(ω02−ω2)2+4ω2β2cos⁡ωt+A(ω02−ω2)(ω02−ω2)2+4ω2β2sin⁡ωt{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x(t)&=x_{0}e^{-\beta t}\cos \left({\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}\,t\right)+{\frac {\beta x_{0}+v_{0}}{\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}}e^{-\beta t}\sin \left({\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}\,t\right)\\&+{\frac {2A\omega \beta }{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\omega ^{2}\beta ^{2}}}e^{-\beta t}\cos \left({\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}\,t\right)\\&+{\frac {A\omega }{\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}}{\frac {\omega ^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}+2\beta ^{2}}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\omega ^{2}\beta ^{2}}}e^{-\beta t}\sin \left({\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}\,t\right)\\&+{\frac {-2A\omega \beta }{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\omega ^{2}\beta ^{2}}}\cos \omega t+{\frac {A(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\omega ^{2}\beta ^{2}}}\sin \omega t\end{aligned}}}

Luckily, this solution is very general. There are many interesting properties of this physical system that we can gleam by analyzing this solution. However, since such analysis is not relevant to Laplace transforms anymore, we will not go into it here.

Take the derivative of f{\displaystyle f} with respect to y{\displaystyle y}.,
Find the constant of integration R{\displaystyle R}.,
Arrive at the solution.",How to Solve Exact Differential Equations," In some cases, it can be trivially easy to tell if an equation is exact just from inspection. For example, ydx+xdy=0{\displaystyle y{\mathrm {d} }x+x{\mathrm {d} }y=0} is exact, because the mixed partials as stated in the introduction both equal 1. Most other equations require that we manually take the partial derivatives and check for equality.

Consider the equation below.


(x+x2y2−exy3+y)dx+(23x3y−3exy2+x+2y)dy=0{\displaystyle (x+x^{2}y^{2}-e^{x}y^{3}+y){\mathrm {d} }x+\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3}y-3e^{x}y^{2}+x+2y\right){\mathrm {d} }y=0}



Calculate partial derivatives.


∂P∂y=2x2y−3exy2+1{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}=2x^{2}y-3e^{x}y^{2}+1}


∂Q∂x=2x2y−3exy2+1{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}=2x^{2}y-3e^{x}y^{2}+1}



Because the partials are equal, the equation is exact.
;
, We know that the relation P=∂f∂x{\displaystyle P={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}} must be true, if f{\displaystyle f} is a solution to the differential equation. However, this is a partial derivative, so doing the integration will only uncover part of the information needed. We can also choose to integrate Q{\displaystyle Q} with respect to y.{\displaystyle y.}


f=∫∂f∂xdx=∫Pdx=∫(x+x2y2−exy3+y)dx=12x2+13x3y2−exy3+xy+R(y){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f&=\int {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int P{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int (x+x^{2}y^{2}-e^{x}y^{3}+y){\mathrm {d} }x\\&={\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}+{\frac {1}{3}}x^{3}y^{2}-e^{x}y^{3}+xy+R(y)\end{aligned}}}

The constant of integration R(y){\displaystyle R(y)} represents this incomplete information, in that any arbitrary function of y{\displaystyle y} only will satisfy P.{\displaystyle P.} If we chose to integrate Q,{\displaystyle Q,} our constant of integration will be with respect to x{\displaystyle x} only.


, Likewise, the condition ∂f∂y=Q{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}=Q} must hold as well. What we find is that the terms in Q{\displaystyle Q} that are purely a function of y{\displaystyle y} equal dRdy.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}.} If we did it the other way, then we would take the derivative with respect to x{\displaystyle x} and find that the terms in P{\displaystyle P} that are purely a function of x{\displaystyle x} must satisfy dRdx.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.}


∂f∂y=23x3y2−3exy2+dRdy=Q{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}={\frac {2}{3}}x^{3}y^{2}-3e^{x}y^{2}+{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}=Q}

By inspection, we can see that dRdy=2y.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}=2y.}


, With practice, you can jump straight to inspecting Q{\displaystyle Q} for any pure y{\displaystyle y} terms (or P{\displaystyle P} for any pure x{\displaystyle x} terms, if we did it the other way) and integrating them. 


R=y2{\displaystyle R=y^{2}}


, The solution contains an arbitrary constant C,{\displaystyle C,} as usual. We also see that this function is defined implicitly. In general, this will be the case, as it can be difficult to express the solution in explicit form.


12x2+13x3y2−exy3+xy+y2=C{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}+{\frac {1}{3}}x^{3}y^{2}-e^{x}y^{3}+xy+y^{2}=C}

Review your completed angle.",How to Construct an Angle Congruent to a Given Angle," The task for this construction is to copy, or transfer, some given angle, using the rules of mathematical construction. Begin with your sample angle on a sheet of paper. You also need to have a blank space to draw the congruent angle.


For ease of reference, refer to the original angle as Angle ABC. Point B is the vertex of the angle.
An angle is made up of two rays that join at the vertex. This angle is comprised of Ray BA and Ray BC.;
, The first tool that you need for constructing a congruent angle is a compass. Compasses come in a variety of styles. Some very inexpensive ones have a simple slot for you to insert a pencil. Some more expensive and accurate compasses have a variety of lead or ink inserts that may be interchangeable. For a simple task like copying an angle, you can use just about any compass that you have available.

, The second tool you need is a straight edge. In fact, for the most genuine constructions, you should avoid using a ruler. According to the true sense of geometric construction, you should not rely on measurements. Therefore, you can use anything with a rigid straight edge., The pencil in your compass will be used to mark certain lengths, but you will also need a pencil, pen or marker for drawing straight lines., Begin by marking a point where you want to place your new angle. Label the point M. Align your straight edge with that point and draw a straight line that begins at M and extends as long as you want it to be.Place an arrow point at the end of the line you drew and label it N. You have just drawn Ray MN. This will be the base of the angle you construct.

, You will need to mark an arc on the original angle. The size of the arc does not matter. Choose a setting that is comfortable for you to work with., When you use the compass, you need to be careful that the arc length you set does not slip. With some advanced compasses, you can use a screw setting to lock in the size. With cheaper compasses, you just need to be careful not to apply too much pressure, or the compass might slip.Set the point of the compass at point B, the vertex of the original angle, and draw an arc that crosses both Ray BA and Ray BC. You do not need to draw an entire circle.
For reference, mark the points where the arc crosses the rays as points X and Y.

, Being careful not to let the compass setting slip, move the compass and set the point on point M. Draw an arc that crosses Ray MN and extends about as long as the one you drew over Angle ABC.For reference, label Point F where the arc crosses Ray MN.

, Pick up the compass and set the point down on Point X. Adjust the width of the compass so the pencil point is on Point Y. Draw a small arc that passes through Y., Without adjusting the size of the compass width, place the tip of the compass on Point F. Draw a new arc, with Point F as the center. This arc should cross the one that you previously drew. Label the point where the two arcs intersect Point G., Set your straight edge to align with Points M and G. Use a pencil or marker to draw a ray that begins at M and passes through G. Place an arrow point on the end of this ray, and label it Ray ML.

, You should have an exact copy of the original Angle ABC. Your new angle is Angle LMN.If the copied angle does not appear to be exactly congruent to the original, you should check that your compass remained stable each time that you lifted it off the paper.

(Optional) Graph the particular solution to the differential equation.",How to Solve a Separable Ordinary Differential Equation," By separating variables, we want to ensure that each of the two variables occurs on a different side of the equation. Thus, the first step in solving such an equation is to confirm that you can write function f(x,y)=dydx{\displaystyle f(x,y)={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}} in terms of two other functions g(x){\displaystyle g(x)} and h(y){\displaystyle h(y)} - in order words, the function is able to be separated. 

 dydx=g(x)h(y){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=g(x)h(y)}

Sometimes, the differential equation is given in Pfaffian form, as seen below.


P(x,y)dx+Q(x,y)dy=0{\displaystyle P(x,y){\mathrm {d} }x+Q(x,y){\mathrm {d} }y=0}



Checking that the variables are separable for this equation is a similar process.
;
, Multiply by dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} and divide by h(y).{\displaystyle h(y).}

 1h(y)dy=g(x)dx{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{h(y)}}{\mathrm {d} }y=g(x){\mathrm {d} }x}


, Now that you are in this form, you can integrate your equation and solve for y if necessary. Sometimes, it is better to leave your solution in implicit form, as it can be very difficult to solve explicitly for more complicated expressions.

 ∫1h(y)dy=∫g(x)dx{\displaystyle \int {\frac {1}{h(y)}}{\mathrm {d} }y=\int g(x){\mathrm {d} }x}


, Solutions to differential equations are not unique, because antiderivatives are not unique. The non-uniqueness of these solutions is seen by the arbitrary constants that come out. For first-order ordinary differential equations, it is often the case that there is one constant. When C{\displaystyle C} is solved for, simply plug the result in to obtain the particular solution given initial conditions.
,


dydx=x−5y2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {x-5}{y^{2}}}}


, Get the y{\displaystyle y}'s on one side and the x{\displaystyle x}'s on the other.


∫y2dy=∫(x−5)dx{\displaystyle \int y^{2}{\mathrm {d} }y=\int (x-5){\mathrm {d} }x}


, Keep in mind that the constant of integration C{\displaystyle C} is arbitrary, so it is only needed on one side. This also means that we don't need to have it under the root. We have thus solved the original equation up to a constant. As this is a first-order equation, we obtained one arbitrary constant, as expected.


13y3=x2−5x+Cy3=3x2−15x+Cy=3x2−15x3+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{3}}y^{3}&=x^{2}-5x+C\\y^{3}&=3x^{2}-15x+C\\y&={\sqrt{3x^{2}-15x}}+C\end{aligned}}}

, The advantage of a differential equation in Pfaffian form is that the constant of integration is isolated on one side, allowing for easy evaluation.


−ln⁡|cos⁡x|−12ln⁡|cos⁡2y|=C{\displaystyle -\ln |\cos x|-{\frac {1}{2}}\ln |\cos 2y|=C}


, In order to factor out a 1/2, we can rewrite −ln⁡|cos⁡x|{\displaystyle -\ln |\cos x|} as −12ln⁡|cos2⁡x|.{\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{2}}\ln |\cos ^{2}x|.} Taking advantage of the arbitrary nature of the constant C,{\displaystyle C,} we can get rid of the 1/2 and the natural logarithm as well.

Alison prefers to drink her coffee at 70°C, but it was served to her at 90°C. While waiting in a 20°C room, she measures her drink to be 85°C two minutes after serving. How much longer does she have to wait before drinking her coffee?


, This law states that the rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings. Below, T(t){\displaystyle T(t)} is the temperature of Alison's coffee as a function of time, TE{\displaystyle T_{E}} is the temperature of the environment, and k{\displaystyle k} is a proportionality constant characteristic of the system. The presence of this additional constant means that we need some additional information about the temperature of the coffee besides its initial temperature and the temperature of the environment.


dT(t)dt=−k(T(t)−TE){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }T(t)}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=-k(T(t)-T_{E})}


, 

Separate variables.


1T−TEdT=−kdt{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{T-T_{E}}}{\mathrm {d} }T=-k{\mathrm {d} }t}



Plug in all known values, and integrate. We know that TE=20,{\displaystyle T_{E}=20,} T(t){\displaystyle T(t)} is going from 90 to 85, and t{\displaystyle t} is going from 0 to 2.


∫90851T−20dT=−k∫02dt{\displaystyle \int _{90}^{85}{\frac {1}{T-20}}{\mathrm {d} }T=-k\int _{0}^{2}{\mathrm {d} }t}


k=12ln7065{\displaystyle k={\frac {1}{2}}\ln {\frac {70}{65}}}




, This time, the final temperature is 70.

Set up the equation. We put a twiddle in the integral because it cannot be the same as a boundary.


∫90701T−20dT=−k∫0tdt~{\displaystyle \int _{90}^{70}{\frac {1}{T-20}}{\mathrm {d} }T=-k\int _{0}^{t}{\mathrm {d} }{\tilde {t}}}



Evaluate the integral.


∫90701T−20dT=ln57{\displaystyle \int _{90}^{70}{\frac {1}{T-20}}{\mathrm {d} }T=\ln {\frac {5}{7}}}



Plug in the value for k{\displaystyle k} and solve for t.{\displaystyle t.}


t=ln5712ln7065≈9.08{\displaystyle t={\frac {\ln {\frac {5}{7}}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\ln {\frac {70}{65}}}}\approx 9.08}



The answer is the time it takes for the coffee to cool after serving. Since Alison has already waited 2 minutes, she must wait an additional 7 minutes before she can drink.


, After solving for k,{\displaystyle k,} we can obtain the curve that we wanted. As we can see above, the curve asymptotically approaches room temperature, and the point where the temperature is 70°C is shown. Note that since our independent variable is time, the function is only defined for t≥0.{\displaystyle t\geq 0.}


T(t)≈20+70e−0.037t{\displaystyle T(t)\approx 20+70e^{-0.037t}}

y^=ProjCol⁡Xy{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {y} }}=\operatorname {Proj} _{\operatorname {Col} X}{\mathbf {y} }}

If we let X=(x1x2...xp),{\displaystyle X={\begin{pmatrix}{\mathbf {x} }_{1}&{\mathbf {x} }_{2}&...&{\mathbf {x} }_{p}\end{pmatrix}},} then we can write the projection as follows, where the angled brackets signify the inner product.


ProjCol⁡Xy=⟨y,x1⟩⟨x1,x1⟩x1+...+⟨y,xp⟩⟨xp,xp⟩xp{\displaystyle \operatorname {Proj} _{\operatorname {Col} X}{\mathbf {y} }={\frac {\langle {\mathbf {y} },{\mathbf {x} }_{1}\rangle }{\langle {\mathbf {x} }_{1},{\mathbf {x} }_{1}\rangle }}{\mathbf {x} }_{1}+\,...\,+{\frac {\langle {\mathbf {y} },{\mathbf {x} }_{p}\rangle }{\langle {\mathbf {x} }_{p},{\mathbf {x} }_{p}\rangle }}{\mathbf {x} }_{p}}



Obviously, this is not something we want to evaluate. 
;
, Now that we have a vector that is in Col⁡X,{\displaystyle \operatorname {Col} X,} we can start to find a β^{\displaystyle {\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}} that yields a consistent solution for the matrix equation below, where β^∈Rn.{\displaystyle {\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}\in {\mathbb {R} }^{n}.}


Xβ^=y^{\displaystyle X{\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}={\hat {\mathbf {y} }}}


, We can relate y{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }} and its projection via z=y−y^,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {z} }={\mathbf {y} }-{\hat {\mathbf {y} }},} where z{\displaystyle {\mathbf {z} }} is the component of y{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }} orthogonal to Col⁡X.{\displaystyle \operatorname {Col} X.}


y−y^=Col⁡(X)⊥{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }-{\hat {\mathbf {y} }}=\operatorname {Col} (X)^{\perp }}

A theorem in linear algebra is that if β{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}} is in the null space of X,{\displaystyle X,} then β{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\beta }}} is orthogonal to the row space of X.{\displaystyle X.} This makes sense, because doing the matrix multiplication for any row should send the result to 0, as required of a vector in the null space of X.{\displaystyle X.} 


Row⁡(X)⊥=Nul⁡X{\displaystyle \operatorname {Row} (X)^{\perp }=\operatorname {Nul} X}



Since we can easily transpose X,{\displaystyle X,} we can say that Col⁡(X)⊥=Nul⁡XT.{\displaystyle \operatorname {Col} (X)^{\perp }=\operatorname {Nul} X^{T}.} Therefore, y−y^=Nul⁡XT,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }-{\hat {\mathbf {y} }}=\operatorname {Nul} X^{T},} leading us to the conclusion below.


XT(y−y^)=0{\displaystyle X^{T}({\mathbf {y} }-{\hat {\mathbf {y} }})=0}




, Since we are not looking for y^,{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {y} }},} but β^,{\displaystyle {\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}},} we substitute this into the homogeneous equation.


XT(y−Xβ^)=0XTy−XTXβ^=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}X^{T}({\mathbf {y} }-X{\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}})&=0\\X^{T}{\mathbf {y} }-X^{T}X{\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}&=0\end{aligned}}}


, Now that we have expressed β^{\displaystyle {\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}} in the quantities that we want, we can evaluate this equation. 


β^=(XTX)−1XTy{\displaystyle {\hat {\boldsymbol {\beta }}}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}{\mathbf {y} }}

Beware that for this equation to be valid, XTX{\displaystyle X^{T}X} must be invertible. If there are free variables in that expression, then there will be an infinite number of valid trendlines.


, We want to fit a least-squares linear trendline y=β0x+β1{\displaystyle y=\beta _{0}x+\beta _{1}} to them. 


(0,3),(1,4),(2,5),(3,7){\displaystyle (0,3),\,(1,4),\,(2,5),\,(3,7)}

Since we are fitting a linear trendline, we can use the data points to write a system of equations.

, The observation vector is simply a column vector consisting of the observations, or the y-values. The elements in the design matrix rely on the coefficients of the equation of the trendline as it pertains to each point. In our case, the first column consists of the coefficients of β0,{\displaystyle \beta _{0},} while the second column consists of the coefficients of β1.{\displaystyle \beta _{1}.}

, This is the line of best fit for the observed datapoints. Our intuition checks that this is the correct answer, as we expected the slope to be slightly greater than 1 and the y-intercept to be slightly less than 3, due to the outlier (3,7).{\displaystyle (3,7).}

Points are identified with ordered pairs such as (-7, -8) or (-2,-6).



 


The first number in an ordered pair is the x-coordinate. It controls the point's horizontal position (how much to the right or left of the origin).






The second number in an ordered pair is the y-coordinate. It controls the point's vertical position (how much up or down from the origin).






The slope between two points is defined as ""rise over run"" — in other words, the description of how far you must travel up (or down) and to the right (or left) in order to move from one point to the other.






Two lines are parallel if they do not intersect (cross over each other).






Two lines are perpendicular if they intersect to form a right angle (90 degrees).

Take your two points and plug them into the equation. (Two coordinates means two y values and two x values.) It doesn't matter which coordinates you put first, as long as you stay consistent. Some examples:





Points (3, 8) and (7, 12). (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) = 12 - 8 / 7 - 3 = 4/4, or 1.
Points (5, 5) and (9, 2). (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) = 2 - 5 / 9 - 5 = -3/4.

Fill the second blank with the y-intercept.

,
Solve the sample problem.",How to Find the Equation of a Line4," Remember, the slope is the coefficient of x when y does not have a coefficient.

In an equation like y = 3/4 x + 7, the slope is 3/4.
In an equation like y = 3x - 2, the slope is 3.
In an equation like y = 3x, the slope is still 3.
In an equation like y = 7, the slope is zero (because there are zero x's in the problem).
In an equation like y = x - 7, the slope is 1.
In an equation like -3x + 4y = 8, the slope is 3/4.





To get the slope on an equation like this, just rearrange it so that y is alone:

Square the value in parentheses.,
Add the numbers under the radical sign.,
Solve for d{\displaystyle d}.",How to Use Distance Formula to Find the Length of a Line," The formula states that d=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}}}, where d{\displaystyle d} equals the distance of the line, (x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} equal the coordinates of the first endpoint of the line segment, and (x2,y2){\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})} equal the coordinates of the second endpoint of the line segment., These might already be given. If not, count along the x-axis and y-axis to find the coordinates.

The x-axis is the horizontal axis; the y-axis is the vertical axis.

The coordinates of a point are written as (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}.

For example, a line segment might have an endpoint at (2,1){\displaystyle (2,1)} and another at (6,4){\displaystyle (6,4)}.


, Be careful to substitute the values for the correct variables. The two x{\displaystyle x} coordinates should be inside the first set of parentheses, and the two y{\displaystyle y} coordinates should be inside the second set of parentheses.

For example, for points (2,1){\displaystyle (2,1)} and (6,4){\displaystyle (6,4)}, your formula would look like this: d=(6−2)2+(4−1)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(6-2)^{2}+(4-1)^{2}}}}


, By using the order of operations, any calculations in parentheses must be completed first.

For example:d=(6−2)2+(4−1)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(6-2)^{2}+(4-1)^{2}}}}d=(4)2+(3)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(4)^{2}+(3)^{2}}}}


, The order of operations states that exponents should be addressed next.

For example:d=(4)2+(3)2{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(4)^{2}+(3)^{2}}}}d=16+9{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {16+9}}}


, You do this calculation as if you were working with whole numbers.

For example:d=16+9{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {16+9}}}d=25{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {25}}}


, To reach your final answer, find the square root of the sum under the radical sign.

Since you are finding a square root, you may have to round your answer.

Since you are working on a coordinate plane, your answer will be in generic “units,” not in centimeters, meters, or another metric unit.

For example:d=25{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {25}}}d=5{\displaystyle d=5} units

Select an appropriate scale.,
Draw the vector to scale.,
Draw a right triangle, with the vector as hypotenuse.,
Label the two component vectors.,
Measure the component vectors.",How to Resolve a Vector Into Components1," To graph the vector and its components, you need to decide on a scale for your graph. You need to choose a scale that is large enough to work with comfortably and accurately, but small enough that your vector can be drawn to scale.For example, suppose you are beginning with a vector that represents a speed of 200 mph (320 km/h) in a northeasterly direction. If you are using standard graph paper of 4 squares per inch, then you might choose to have each square represent 20 mph (32.2 km/h). This represents a scale of 1 inch (2.5 cm) = 80 mph.

There is no need to draw an x-axis and y-axis, because the vector’s placement with respect to the origin is irrelevant. You are concerned with measuring the vector itself, and not its location in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional space. You are using the graph paper only as a measuring tool, so location does not matter.
;
, It is important that you sketch your vector as accurately as possible. You need to represent both the correct direction and length of the vector in your drawing.It will help to use an accurate ruler. For example, if you have chosen the scale of one square on your graph paper representing 20 mph (32.2 km/h), and each square is 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), then a vector of 200 mph (320 km/h) will be a line that is 10 squares, or 2 1/2 inches, long.

Use a protractor, if necessary, to show the angle or direction of the vector. If your vector shows movement in the northeast direction, for example, you would draw a line at a 45 degree angle from the horizontal.

The direction of the vector can indicate many different kinds of direction measurements. If you are discussing travel, it might mean a direction on the map. To depict the path of a thrown or hit object, the angle of the vector might mean the angle of travel from the ground. In nuclear physics, a vector might indicate the direction of an electron.


, Using your ruler, begin at the tail of the vector and draw a horizontal line as wide as necessary to coincide with the head of the vector. Mark an arrowhead at the tip of that line to indicate that this is also a component vector. Then draw a vertical line from that point to the head of the original vector. Mark an arrowhead at this point as well.You should have created a right triangle, consisting of three vectors. The original vector is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. The base of the right triangle is a horizontal vector, and the height of the right triangle is a vertical vector.

There are two exceptions, when you cannot construct a right triangle. This will occur when the original vector is either exactly horizontal or vertical. For a horizontal vector, the vertical component is zero, and for a vertical vector, the horizontal component is zero.


, Depending on what is being represented by your original vector, you should label the two component vectors that you have just drawn. For example, using the vector that represents travel in a northeasterly direction, the horizontal vector represents “East,” and the vertical vector represents “North.”Other samples of components might be “Up/Down” or “Left/Right.” 


, You can determine the magnitudes of your two component vectors using either the graph paper alone or a ruler. If you use a ruler, then measure the length of each of the component vectors and convert using the scale you have selected. For example, a horizontal line that is 1 1⁄4 inches (3.2 cm) long, using a scale of 1 inch (2.5 cm) = 80 mph., would represent an easterly component of 100 mph (160 km/h).If you choose to rely on the graph paper rather than a ruler, you may need to estimate a bit. If your line crosses three full squares on the graph paper and falls in the middle of the fourth square, you would need to estimate the fraction of that last square and multiply by your scale. For example, if 1 square = 20 mph (32.2 km/h), and you estimate that a component vector is 3 1/2 squares, then that vector represents 70 mph.

Repeat the measurement for both the horizontal and vertical component vectors, and label your results.

Isolate your unknown variable on one side of the equals sign.,

Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the sides of real-world right triangles.",How to Use the Pythagorean Theorem1," The Pythagorean Theorem is applicable only to right triangles, so, before proceeding, it's important to make sure your triangle fits the definition of a right triangle. Luckily, there is only one qualifying factor - to be a right triangle, your triangle must contain one angle of exactly 90 degrees.









As a form of visual shorthand, right angles are often marked with a small square, rather than a rounded ""curve"", to identify them as such. Look for this special mark in the corner of your triangle.;
, In the Pythagorean Theorem, the variables a and b refer to the sides that meet in a right angle, while the variable c refers to the hypotenuse - the longest side which is always opposite the right angle. So, to begin, assign the shorter sides of your triangle the variables a and b (it doesn’t matter which side is labeled 'a' or 'b'), and assign the hypotenuse the variable c.








, The Pythagorean Theorem allows mathematicians to find the length of any one of a right triangle's sides as long as they know the lengths of the other two sides. Determine which of your sides has an unknown length - a, b, and/or c. If the length of only one of your sides is unknown, you're ready to proceed.









Let's say, for example, that we know that our hypotenuse has a length of 5 and one of the other sides has a length of 3, but we're not sure what the length of the third side is. In this case, we know we're solving for the length of the third side, and, because we know the lengths of the other two, we're ready to go! We'll return to this example problem in the following steps.
If the lengths of two of your sides are unknown, you'll need to determine the length of one more side to use the Pythagorean Theorem. Basic trigonometry functions can help you here if you know one of the non-right angles in the triangle.

, Insert your values for the lengths of the sides of your triangle into the equation a2 + b2 = c2. Remember that a and b are the non hypotenuse sides, while c is the hypotenuse.









In our example, we know the length of one side and the hypotenuse (3 & 5), so we would write our equation as 3² + b² = 5²


, To solve your equation, begin by taking the square of each of your known sides. Alternatively, if you find it easier, you may leave your side lengths in the exponent form, then square them later.









In our example, we would square 3 and 5 to get 9 and 25, respectively. We can rewrite our equation as 9 + b² = 25.

, If necessary, use basic algebra operations to get your unknown variable on one side of the equals sign and your two squares on the other side of the equals sign. If you're solving for the hypotenuse, c will already be isolated, so you won't need to do anything to isolate it.









In our example, our current equation is 9 + b² = 25. To isolate b², let's subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. This leaves us with b² = 16.

, You should now be left with one variable squared on one side of the equation and a number on the other side. Simply take the square root of both sides to find the length of your unknown side.









In our example, b² = 16, taking the square root of both sides gives us b = 4. Thus, we can say that the length of the unknown side of our triangle is 4.

, The reason that the Pythagorean Theorem is so widely used today is that it's applicable in countless practical situations. Learn to recognize right triangles in real life - in any situation where two straight objects or lines meet at a right angle and a third line or object stretches diagonally across from the right angle, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of one of the sides, given the length of the other two.

Let's try real-world example that's a little more difficult. A ladder is leaning against a building. The base of the ladder is 5 meters (16.4 ft) from the bottom of the wall. The ladder reaches 20 meters (65.6 ft) up the wall of the building. How long is the ladder?

""5 meters (16.4 ft) from the bottom of wall” and ""20 meters (65.6 ft) up the wall” clue us into the lengths of the sides of our triangle. Since the wall and the ground (presumably) meet at a right angle and the ladder leans diagonally against the wall, we can think of this arrangement as a right triangle with sides of length a = 5 and b = 20. The length of the ladder is the hypotenuse, so c is our unknown. Let's use the Pythagorean Theorem:

a² + b² = c²
(5)² + (20)² = c²
25 + 400 = c²
425 = c²
sqrt(425) = c
c = 20.6 . The approximate length of the ladder is 20.6 meters (67.6 ft).

Solve for the magnitude.",How to Find the Magnitude of a Vector1," Every vector can be numerically represented in the Cartesian coordinate system with a horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) component.It is written as an ordered pair v=<x,y>{\displaystyle v=<x,y>}.

 For example, the vector above has a horizontal component of 3 and a vertical component of -5, therefore the ordered pair is <3, -5>.
;
, When you draw the horizontal and vertical components, you end up with a right triangle. The magnitude of the vector is equal to the hypotenuse of the triangle so you can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate it.
, The Pythagorean theorem is A2 + B2 = C2. “A” and “B” are the horizontal and vertical components of the triangle while “C” is the hypotenuse. Since the vector is the hypotenuse you want to solve for “C”.

 x2 + y2 = v2

 v = √(x2 + y2))


, Using the equation above, you can plug in the numbers of the ordered pair of the vector to solve for the magnitude.

 For example, v = √((32+(-5)2))

 v =√(9 + 25) = √34 = 5.831

If your triangle contains one angle that is exactly 90 degrees, it is a right triangle and you can proceed.


Right angles are often notated in textbooks and on tests with a small square in the corner of the angle. This special mark means ""90 degrees.""

, The variable ""c"" will always be assigned to the hypotenuse, or longest side. Choose one of the other sides to be a, and call the other side b (it doesn't matter which is which; the math will turn out the same). Then copy the lengths of a and b into the formula, according to the following example:


If your triangle has sides of 3 and 4, and you have assigned letters to those sides such that a = 3 and b = 4, then you should write your equation out as: 32 + 42 = c2.

, To find the square of a number, you simply multiply the number by itself, so a2 = a x a. Find the squares of both a and b, and write them into your formula.


If a = 3, a2 = 3 x 3, or 9. If b = 4, then b2 = 4 x 4, or 16.
When you plug those values into your equation, it should now look like this: 9 + 16 = c2.

, Enter this into your equation, and this will give you the value for c2. There is only one step left to go, and you will have that hypotenuse solved!


In our example, 9 + 16 = 25, so you should write down 25 = c2.

, Use the square root function on your calculator (or your memory of the multiplication table) to find the square root of c2. The answer is the length of your hypotenuse!


In our example, c2 = 25. The square root of 25 is 5 (5 x 5 = 25, so Sqrt(25) = 5). That means c = 5, the length of our hypotenuse!

Construct a rough sketch of the original vector.,
Sketch and label the component vectors.,
Use the sine function to calculate the vertical component.,
Use the cosine function to calculate the horizontal component.",How to Resolve a Vector Into Components2," By relying on mathematical calculations, your graph does not need to be as neatly drawn. You do not need to determine any measurement scale. Just sketch a ray in the general direction of your vector. Label your sketched vector with its magnitude and the angle that it makes from the horizontal.For example, consider a rocket that is being fired upwards at a 60 degree angle, at a velocity of 1,500 meters (5,000 ft) per second. You would sketch a ray that points diagonally upward. Label its length “1500 m/s” and label its base angle “60°.”

The diagram shown above indicates a force vector of 5 Newtons at an angle of 37 degrees from the horizontal.


, Sketch a horizontal ray beginning at the base of your original vector, pointing in the same direction (left or right) as the original. This represents the horizontal component of the original vector. Sketch a vertical ray that connects the head of your horizontal vector to the head of your original angled vector. This represents the vertical component of the original vector.The horizontal and vertical components of a vector represent a theoretical, mathematical way of breaking a force into two parts. Imagine the child's toy Etch-a-Sketch, with the separate ""Vertical"" and ""Horizontal"" drawing knobs. If you drew a line using only the ""Vertical"" knob and then followed with a line using only the ""Horizontal"" knob, you would end at the same spot as if you had turned both knobs together at exactly the same speeds. This illustrates how a horizontal and vertical force can act simultaneously on an object.


, Because the components of a vector create a right triangle, you can use trigonometric calculations to get precise measurements of the components. Use the equation:sin⁡θ=verticalhypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{vertical}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}

For the missile example, you can calculate the vertical component by substituting the values that you know, and then simplifying, as follows:


sin⁡θ=verticalhypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{vertical}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


sin⁡(60)=vertical1500{\displaystyle \sin(60)={\frac {\text{vertical}}{1500}}}


1500sin⁡(60)=vertical{\displaystyle 1500\sin(60)={\text{vertical}}}


1500∗0.866=vertical{\displaystyle 1500*0.866={\text{vertical}}}


1,299{\displaystyle 1,299}



Label your result with the appropriate units. In this case, the vertical component represents an upward speed of 1,299 meters (4,000 ft) per second.

The diagram above shows an alternate example, calculating the components of a force of 5 Newtons at a 37 degree angle. Using the sine function, the vertical force is calculated to be 3 Newtons.


, In the same way that you use sine to calculate the vertical component, you can use cosine to find the magnitude of the horizontal component. Use the equation:cos⁡θ=horizontalhypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\text{horizontal}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}

Use the details from the missile example to find its horizontal component as follows:


cos⁡θ=horizontalhypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\text{horizontal}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


cos⁡(60)=horizontal1500{\displaystyle \cos(60)={\frac {\text{horizontal}}{1500}}}


1500cos⁡(60)=horizontal{\displaystyle 1500\cos(60)={\text{horizontal}}}


1500∗0.5=horizontal{\displaystyle 1500*0.5={\text{horizontal}}}


750{\displaystyle 750}



Label your result with the appropriate units. In this case, the horizontal component represents a forward (or left, right, backward) speed of 750 meters (2,000 ft) per second.

The diagram above shows an alternate example, calculating the components of a force of 5 Newtons at a 37 degree angle. Using the cosine function, the horizontal force is calculated to be 4 Newtons.

Understand what “adding” vectors means.,
Break each vector into its component parts.,
Add the components.,
Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.,
Use trigonometry to find the angle of the resultant vector.,
Summarize your resultant vector.",How to Resolve a Vector Into Components3," Addition is generally a fairly simple concept, but it takes on special meaning when working with vectors. A single vector represents a movement, a force, or some other physical element acting upon an object. If there are two or more forces acting at the same time, you can “add” these forces to find the resultant force acting on the object.

For example, think of a golf ball that is hit into the air. One force acting on that object is the force of the initial hit. This force consists of an angle and magnitude. Another force acting on the object might be the wind, which has its own angle and magnitude. Adding these two forces can describe the resulting travel of the ball.


, Before you can add the vectors, you need to determine the components of each one. Using either of the processes described in this article, find the horizontal and vertical components of each force.

For example, suppose the golf ball is hit at a 30 degree angle upward with a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h). Using trigonometry, the two component vectors are, therefore:


Vertical=130sin⁡(30)=65mph{\displaystyle {\text{Vertical}}=130\sin(30)=65{\text{mph}}}


Horizontal=130cos⁡(30)=112.6mph{\displaystyle {\text{Horizontal}}=130\cos(30)=112.6{\text{mph}}}



Then consider the vector that represents the force of the wind. Suppose the wind is blowing the ball downward at an angle of 10 degrees, at speed of 10 mph (16.1 km/h). (We are ignoring left and right forces for simplicity of calculation). The wind’s two components can be calculated similarly:


Vertical=10sin⁡(−10)=−1.74mph{\displaystyle {\text{Vertical}}=10\sin(-10)=-1.74{\text{mph}}}


Horizontal=10cos⁡(−10)=9.85mph{\displaystyle {\text{Horizontal}}=10\cos(-10)=9.85{\text{mph}}}

Notice that we use an angle of -10 degrees because the wind is blowing down, acting against the force of the hit.




, Because the component vectors are always measured at right angles, you can add them directly. Pay attention matching the horizontal component of one vector to the horizontal component of the other, and the same for the vertical components.

For this sample, the resultant vertical vector is the sum of the two components:


Vertical=65+(−1.74)=63.26{\displaystyle {\text{Vertical}}=65+(-1.74)=63.26}


Horizontal=112.6+9.85=122.45{\displaystyle {\text{Horizontal}}=112.6+9.85=122.45}



Interpret the meaning of these results. The net force acting on the golf ball, due to both the hit and the wind, is the equivalent of a single force with components of 63.26 mph (101.81 km/h) vertically and 122.45 miles per hour horizontally.


, Ultimately, what you would like to know is the net effect of both the golf swing and the wind, acting together on the ball. If you know the two components, you can put them together with the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.

Recall that the component vectors represent the legs of a right triangle. The resultant vector is the hypotenuse of that right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, c2=a2+b2{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}}, you can calculate this as follows:


Resultant2=63.262+122.452{\displaystyle {\text{Resultant}}^{2}=63.26^{2}+122.45^{2}}


Resultant2=18,995.83{\displaystyle {\text{Resultant}}^{2}=18,995.83}


Resultant=18,995.83{\displaystyle {\text{Resultant}}={\sqrt {18,995.83}}}


Resultant=137.83{\displaystyle {\text{Resultant}}=137.83}



Thus, the resultant vector represents a single force on the ball with a magnitude of 137.83 mph (221.82 km/h). Notice that this is slightly higher than the force of the initial hit, because the wind is pushing the ball forward at the same time that it pushes it down.


, Knowing the force of the resultant vector is half of the solution. The other half is to find the net angle of the resultant vector. In this example, because the golf swing applies an upward force and the wind applies a downward, though lesser, force, you need to find the resulting angle.

Sketch a right triangle and label the component parts. The horizontal base of the triangle represents the forward vector component of 122.45. The vertical leg of the triangle represents the upward vector component of 63.26. The hypotenuse represents the resultant vector with a magnitude of 137.83.

You can choose either the sine function, with the vertical component, or the cosine function, with the horizontal component, to find the angle. The result will be the same.


sin⁡θ=63.26137.83{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {63.26}{137.83}}}


sin⁡θ=0.459{\displaystyle \sin \theta =0.459}


θ=arcsin⁡(0.459){\displaystyle \theta =\arcsin(0.459)}


θ=27.32{\displaystyle \theta =27.32}



Thus, the resultant vector represents a single force acting on the ball at an upward angle of 27.32 degrees. This makes sense, as it is slightly lower than the angle of the swing, at 30 degrees, due to the downward force of the wind. However, the golf swing is a much stronger force than the wind in this example, so the angle is still close to 30.


, To report the resultant vector, give both its angle and magnitude. In the golf ball example, the resultant vector has a magnitude of 137.83 mph (221.82 km/h), at an angle of 27.32 degrees above the horizontal.

Define two points in the X-Y plane.,
Plot your two points on a graph.,
Find the lengths of the non-hypotenuse sides of your triangle.,
Use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the hypotenuse.",How to Use the Pythagorean Theorem2," The Pythagorean Theorem can easily be used to calculate the straight-line distance between two points in the X-Y plane. All you need to know are the x and y coordinates of any two points. Usually, these coordinates are written as ordered pairs in the form (x, y).









To find the distance between these two points, we will treat each point as one of the non-right angle corners of a right triangle. By doing this, it's easy to find the length of the a and b sides, then calculate c, the hypotenuse, which is the distance between the two points.

, In a typical X-Y plane, for each point (x,y), x gives a coordinate on the horizontal axis and y gives a coordinate on the vertical axis. You can find the distance between the two points without plotting them on a graph, but doing so gives you a visual reference that you can use to ensure your answer makes sense.








, Using your two points as the corners of the triangle adjacent to the hypotenuse, find the lengths of the a and b sides of the triangle. You can do this visually on the graph, or by using the formulas |x1 - x2| for the horizontal side and |y1 - y2| for the vertical side, where (x1,y1) is your first point and (x2,y2) is your second.









Let's say our two points are (6,1) and (3,5). The side length of the horizontal side of our triangle is:

|x1 - x2|
|3 - 6|
| -3 | = 3



The length of the vertical side is:

|y1 - y2|
|1 - 5|
| -4 | = 4



So, we can say that in our right triangle, side a = 3 and side b = 4.

, The distance between your two points is the hypotenuse of the triangle whose two sides you've just defined. Use the Pythagorean Theorem as you normally would to find the hypotenuse, setting a as the length of your first side and b as the length of the second.









In our example using points (3,5) and (6,1), our side lengths are 3 and 4, so we would find the hypotenuse as follows:



(3)²+(4)²= c²
c= sqrt(9+16)
c= sqrt(25)
c= 5. The distance between (3,5) and (6,1) is 5.

Determine the components of both points of the vector.,
Use a modified formula to solve for the magnitude.,
Solve for the magnitude.",How to Find the Magnitude of a Vector2," Every vector can be numerically represented in the Cartesian coordinate system with a horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) component.It is written as an ordered pair v=<x,y>{\displaystyle v=<x,y>}. If you are given a vector that is placed away from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system, you must define the components of both points of the vector.

 For example, the vector AB has an ordered pair for point A and point B. 

 Point A has a horizontal component of 5 and a vertical component of 1, so the ordered pair is <5, 1>. 

 Point B has a horizontal component of 1 and a vertical component of 2, so the ordered pair is <1, 2>. 


, Because you now have two points you are dealing with, you must subtract the x and y components of each point before you solve using the equation v = √((x2-x1)2 +(y2-y1)2).Point A is ordered pair 1 <x1, y1> and point B is ordered pair 2 <x2, y2>


, Plug in the numbers of your ordered pairs and calculate the magnitude. Using our above example the calculation looks like this:

 v = √((x2-x1)2 +(y2-y1)2)

 v = √((1-5)2 +(2-1)2)

 v = √((-4)2 +(1)2)

 v = √(16+1) = √(17) = 4.12

Don't worry if your answer is not a whole number. Vector magnitudes can be decimals.

Learn to recognize Pythagorean Triple Triangles.,
Memorize the side ratios of a 45-45-90 right triangle.,
Learn the side ratios of a 30-60-90 right triangle.",How to Find the Length of the Hypotenuse2," The side lengths of a Pythagorean triple are integers that fit the Pythagorean Theorem. These special triangles appear frequently in geometry text books and on standardized tests like the SAT and the GRE. If you memorize the first 2 Pythagorean triples, in particular, you can save yourself a lot of time on these tests because you can immediately know the hypotenuse of one of these triangles just by looking at the side lengths! The first Pythagorean triple is 3-4-5 (32 + 42 = 52, 9 + 16 = 25). When you see a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4, you can instantly be certain that the hypotenuse will be 5 without having to do any calculations.
The ratio of a Pythagorean triple holds true even when the sides are multiplied by another number. For example a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8 will have a hypotenuse of 10 (62 + 82 = 102, 36 + 64 = 100). The same holds true for 9-12-15, and even 1.5-2-2.5. Try the math and see for yourself!
The second Pythagorean triple that commonly appears on tests is 5-12-13 (52 + 122 = 132, 25 + 144 = 169). Also be on the lookout for multiples like 10-24-26 and 2.5-6-6.5.

, A 45-45-90 right triangle has angles of 45, 45, and 90 degrees, and is also called an Isosceles Right Triangle. It occurs frequently on standardized tests, and is a very easy triangle to solve. The ratio between the sides of this triangle is 1:1:Sqrt(2), which means that the length of the legs are equal, and the length of the hypotenuse is simply the leg length multiplied by the square root of two.


To calculate the hypotenuse of this triangle based on the length of one of the legs, simply multiply the leg length by Sqrt(2).Knowing this ratio comes in especially handy when your test or homework question gives you the side lengths in terms of variables instead of integers.

, This triangle has angle measurements of 30, 60, and 90 degrees, and occurs when you cut an equilateral triangle in half. The sides of the 30-60-90 right triangle always maintain the ratio 1:Sqrt(3):2, or x:Sqrt(3)x:2x. If you are given the length of one leg of 30-60-90 right triangle and are asked to find the hypotenuse, it is very easy to do:If you are given the length of the shortest leg (opposite the 30-degree angle,) simply multiply the leg length by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse. For instance, if the length of the shortest leg is 4, you know that the hypotenuse length must be 8.
If you are given the length of the longer leg (opposite the 60-degree angle,) multiply that length by 2/Sqrt(3) to find the length of the hypotenuse. For instance, if the length of the longer leg is 4, you know that the hypotenuse length must be 4.62.

To find the sine of angle, you will usually press the sin key and then enter the angle measurement in degrees. On some calculators, however, you must enter the degree measurement first and then the sin key. You will have to experiment with your calculator or check the manual to find out which it is.


To find the sine of an 80 degree angle, you will either need to key in sin 80 followed by the equal sign or enter key, or 80 sin. (The answer is -0.9939.)
You can also type in ""sine calculator"" into a web search, and find a number of easy-to-use calculators that will remove any guesswork., The Law of Sines is a useful tool for solving triangles. In particular, it can help you find the hypotenuse of a right triangle if you know the length of one side, and the measure of one other angle in addition to the right angle. For any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C, the Law of Sines states that a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C.The Law of Sines can actually be used to solve any triangle, but only a right triangle will have a hypotenuse.

, The hypotenuse (longest side) must be ""c"". For the sake of simplicity, label the side with the known length as ""a,"" and the other ""b"". Then assign variables A, B, and C to the angles of the triangle. The right angle opposite the hypotenuse will be ""C"". The angle opposite side ""a"" is angle ""A,"" and the angle opposite side ""b"" is ""B"".

, Because it is a right angle, you already know that C = 90 degrees, and you also know the measure of A or B. Since the internal degree measurement of a triangle must always equal 180 degrees, you can easily calculate the measurement of the third angle using the following formula: 180 – (90 + A) = B. You can also reverse the equation such that 180 – (90 + B) = A.


For example, if you know that A = 40 degrees, then B = 180 – (90 + 40). Simplify this to B = 180 – 130, and you can quickly determine that B = 50 degrees.

, At this point, you should know the degree measurements of all three angles, and the length of side a. It is now time to plug this information into the Law of Sines equation to determine the lengths of the other two sides.


To continue our example, let's say that the length of side a = 10. Angle C = 90 degrees, angle A = 40 degrees, and angle B = 50 degrees.

, We just need to plug our numbers in and solve the following equation to determine the length of hypotenuse c: length of side a / sin A = length of side c / sin C. This might still look a bit intimidating, but the sine of 90 degrees is a constant, and always equals 1! Our equation can thus be simplified to: a / sin A = c / 1, or just a / sin A = c.

, You can do this in two separate steps, by first calculating sin A and writing it down, and then dividing by a. Or you can key it all into the calculator at the same time. If you do, remember to include parentheses after the division sign. For example, key in either 10 / (sin 40) or 10 / (40 sin), depending on your calculator.


Using our example, we find that sin 40 = 0.64278761. To find the value of c, we simply divide the length of a by this number, and learn that 10 / 0.64278761 = 15.6, the length of our hypotenuse!

Recall the definition of a vector.,
Understand the terminology of graphing vectors.,
Recall some basic trigonometry.",How to Resolve a Vector Into Components4," A vector is a mathematical tool that is used in physics to represent the way forces act on an object. A vector is said to represent two elements of the force, its direction and its magnitude.For example, for any moving object, you can describe its movement by giving the direction of its travel and its speed. You might say a plane is moving, for example, in a northwest direction at 500 mph (800 km/h). Northwest is the direction, and 500 mph (800 km/h) is the magnitude.

A dog being held on a leash experiences a vector force. The leash, when held by the owner, is being pulled diagonally upward with some measure of force. The angle of the diagonal is the direction of the vector, and the strength of the force is the magnitude.


, When you draw a vector, either using a precisely drawn representation on graph paper or just a rough sketch, certain geometrical terms are used.A vector is represented graphically by a ray{\displaystyle {\text{ray}}}. A ray, in geometry, is a line segment that begins at one point and, theoretically, continues infinitely in some direction. A ray is drawn by marking a point, then a line segment of appropriate length, and marking an arrowhead at the opposite end of the line segment. 

The tail{\displaystyle {\text{tail}}} of a vector is its starting point. Geometrically, this is the endpoint of the ray.

The head{\displaystyle {\text{head}}} of a vector is the position of the arrowhead. The one key difference between a geometric ray and a vector is that, in geometry, the arrowhead of the ray represents theoretical travel of infinite distance in the given direction. A vector, however, uses the arrowhead to indicate direction, but the length of the vector ends at the tip of the line segment, to measure its magnitude. In other words, if you sketch a ray in geometry, the length is irrelevant. If you draw a vector, however, the length is very important.


, Component parts of a vector rely on the trigonometry of right triangles. Any diagonal line segment can become the hypotenuse of a right triangle by sketching a horizontal line from one end and a vertical line from the other end. When those two lines meet, you will have defined a right triangle.The reference angle is the angle that is made by measuring from the horizontal base of the right triangle to the hypotenuse.

The sine of the reference angle can be determined by dividing the length of the opposite leg by the length of the hypotenuse.

The cosine of the reference angle can be determined by dividing the length of the base of the triangle (or the adjacent leg) by the length of the hypotenuse.

, This is the process of identifying the unit vector for a given vector A.

, A bound vector in Cartesian space has its initial point at the origin of the coordinate system, expressed as (0,0) in two dimensions. This allows you to identify a vector solely in terms of its terminal point.

Know the basic structure for straight line equations.,
Determine if the gradient or m is negative or not.,
Find the gradient.,
Find the y-intercept or c. This is probably the easiest step of all in this how-to article.,
Take one good, quick look at the number on the x or y axis.,
Don't forget the lines could be in negative as well.,
Practice with some basic non-vertical and non-horizontal examples.,
Work your way up to harder lines.",How to Quickly Determine the Equation of a Straight Line in a Graph," The slope-intercept form will be used commonly here. It is y=mx+c where:



y is the number in relation to the y-axis;

m is the gradient or slope of the line;

x is the number in relation to the x-axis;
and c is the y-intercept.
To avoid confusion, keep in mind to always have a positive y.;
, So there are two sides to choose from: y=mx+c or y=-mx+c. If the line goes from top right to bottom left, m is positive. But if the line goes from top left to bottom right, m is negative.

, Before you give up and resort to calculating it with numbers, try this simpler way. See if the line is steeper than either y=x or y=-x. If it is steeper, it means m>1. If the line is flatter or less steep, it means m<1.


Time to count boxes. If m>1, count the vertical boxes for one horizontal box width. Count the number of boxes it takes for the line to reach from one double-integer point (e.g. (2,3) or (5,1); not (5.4, 3) or (1.2, 3.9)) to another double integer point. The number of boxes counted is directly equal to m.
But if m<1, count the horizontal boxes for a one vertical box width. Let the number of the boxes counted be n. The gradient if m<1 would be one over n or 1/n.

, The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

, If the line is vertical, look at the x-intercept. If the line is horizontal, look at the y-intercept. The equation for these types of lines are different from the y=mx+c structure.


Example 1: The line is a vertical line. Thus, we should look at the x-intercept. Looking at it clearly, we could see the number '6'. The equation for this line is x=6. The meaning is that x will always be 6 since the line is straight, so it will stay on 6 and not cross any other axis.
Example 2: The line is a horizontal line. We should look at the y-intercept. The equation is y=1 because the horizontal line will stay on one forever without crossing the x-axis.

,


Example 3: This line is a vertical line. We should look at x-axis. The line goes with the number '-8'. Thus, the equation to this line is x=-8.
Example 4: This line is horizontal. Look at the y-axis. The horizontal line aligns with the number '-5'. The equation is y=-5.

, Time for something more challenging!


Example 1: Notice how it takes two vertical blocks to get from one double integer point to another one. Also notice that it is steeper than a simple y=x. We can conclude that the gradient is '2'. So now we've got y=2x. But we're not done yet. We still need to find the y-intercept. Notice that the line crosses the y-axis at '-1' in the y-axis. The equation for this line is indeed y=2x-1.
Example 2: See that the line goes from top left to bottom right, it means that it has a negative gradient. To reach one double-integer point to another, the number of horizontal blocks is 3 while the number of vertical blocks is 1. It means that the gradient is '-1/3'. The y-intercept is positive 3 as you see the line crossing the y-axis. This line is y=-1/3x+3.

, Study this image. You might have noticed this rule before, but study it to get to know it better. You might also want to look back at some past examples.


Example 1: Here is a line that is unfamiliar. But look back at the rule above and try to apply the same reasoning with this line. This line has a positive gradient. To get from one double-integer point to another, it vertically goes up 4 blocks and horizontally goes right 3 blocks. Looking back at the rule above, we could determine that this line has a gradient of '4/3'. The y-intercept is 2, so the line is y=4/3x+2.
Example 2: For this line, we could see that the y-intercept is '0' so we don't need to add anything for c. It has a negative gradient. To get from one double-integer point to another, the number of vertical blocks needed is 3 while the number of horizontal blocks needed is 4. Thus, the equation is y=-3/4x.

Understand the concept behind mathematical induction.,
Prove the base case for the property holds true.,
State the inductive hypothesis.,
Prove the inductive hypothesis holds true for the next value in the chain.,
Conclude the property is validly proved by mathematical induction.",How to Do Induction Proofs1," Let's say you are asked to calculate the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers, written as , by induction.(The last term here derives from the fact that if you double any number and then subtract 1 from that value, the resulting number will always be odd.) At first, you might notice that the sum of consecutive odd numbers seems to follow a pattern (e.g., 1 + 3 = 4; 1 + 3 + 5 = 9; 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16; 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25).The sum seems to be the number of odd numbers you are adding squared, right? Now that we have an idea of the pattern at play here, we can begin our proof.;
, In our example, we have noticed a pattern relating to the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers. To complete the task we are assigned (i.e., calculating the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers), we could actually take the time to write out all the odd numbers, starting with 1 all the way to ""n,"" and add them up. But there is an easier way. Based on what we observed about the first few summations we did, we could offer this property, which we will try to prove via induction:


1 + 3 + . . . + (2n - 1) = n^2
We will refer to this property as P(n), because ""n"" is the variable we used above.
The left-hand sign of the equation represents the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers, beginning with 1.

, It is helpful to think of induction in terms of dominoes, which recalls the ""chain of implications"" discussed in the introduction above. Think of every value of ""n"" in the property above, P(n), as an individual domino, arranged in a line. If we can show that P(1)—the first value in the chain—is true, that means we can knock over the first domino. Further, if we assume that any one domino can be knocked over (i.e., P(n) holds true for some arbitrary value of ""n"") and, with that assumption, that the following domino can also be knocked over (i.e., P(n + 1) is also true), that means we can knock over all the dominoes with our stated property. This means the property is true in all cases and we have achieved our goal through induction.

, The ""base case"" for a particular property is some small value used to show that the first statement of the property holds true. In this case, we will use ""1,"" as this is the first odd number and easy to work with. If the property holds true for the base case, we will have shown we can knock over the first domino and we can move on to the next step.


P(1): 1 = 1^2
P(1): 1 = 1 (It held, we're good. First domino down.)

, The next step of induction involves making an assumption. In our example, we will assume that for some arbitrary value of ""n""—let's say ""k""—that the statement is true. That is, we have faith that our property will hold regardless of the value used for ""n."" If this wasn't true, our property (i.e., our solution to the original problem of calculating the sum of the first ""n"" odd numbers) wouldn't have much use. While we haven't proved anything yet, this assumption is important, and takes the following form:


P(k): 1 + 3 + . . . + (2k - 1) = k^2
Remember that we are assuming this is true going forward in the proof (i.e., that we can knock over any individual domino in the chain).

, In other words, we assume that P(k) holds true and, using that assumption, try to prove that P(k + 1) also holds true. If we can do that, we have proven that our theory is valid using induction because if knocking down one domino (assuming P(k) is true) knocks down the next domino (using that assumption, proving P(k + 1) is also true), all the dominoes will fall and our property will be proved valid. So let's try that:


P(k): 1 + 3 + . . . + (2k - 1) = k^2 is true.
P(k + 1): 1 + 3 + . . . + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
The italicized portion above on the left-hand side of the equation represents the addition of the next odd-numbered term in the sequence, k + 1. If we can make that left-hand side equal the right-hand side, we will have succeeded.
From our assumption, we know that the un-italicized portion above equals k^2, so let's make that replacement.
P(k + 1): k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
P(k + 1): k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
P(k + 1): (k + 1)^2 = (k + 1)^2

, By use of a little algebra, we have proved that our property holds true not only for some arbitrary value of ""n,"" but also for the value following that value. We have shown that P(1) is true, assumed that P(k) is true, and proved that, based on that assumption, P(k + 1) is also true. To use our continuing domino analogy, we successfully knocked down the first domino, showing our property has some value. Then, assuming that any arbitrary domino in the chain could be knocked over, we proved that doing so will necessarily knock down the next domino, ad infinitum down the rest of the chain. Thus, we have shown that our property holds in general and have successfully concluded our proof by mathematical induction.

See the article How to Determine the Geometric Version of the Golden Mean (Ratio or Proportion) for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Determine the Mean Proportion or Square Root Geometrically," Usually, what is meant by a ""mean proportional"", is a line (or number) between two lines in length such that its proportion over the first shorter line is the same proportion the second longer line has to it -- thus it is the mean, And what is meant by ""square root"" is that number (or line) which when multiplied times itself, produces a square; however, the root itself may be the product or sum of two or more other numbers. The method presented here takes advantage of exactly that fact, so if you have a square in mind, please make it the product of a number a and a number b.;
, If you are finding the square root of a large number, you will need to scale up your centimeter or millimeter ruler, e.g. if your number = 6085 and you want to find the square root of it, then your 100 divisions of a 10 centimeter ruler instead of meaning 100, would seem to need to mean 10,000, so each division is worth 100 more divisions, since 100*100= 10,000. You would find the number 6096 just shy of 6.1 centimeters then, right? But what you really want to measure in are the factors of 6096, and those will be less than 100 x 100, so let's say each division on your 100 millimeter ruler is worth 10, which gives us the number of 1,000 as our new yardstick.

, Mark point a at the far left, point b 127 units to a's right, and point c at the other endpoint, 48 more units to the right, with vertical hash marks. Also mark the center of the line with a hash mark at 87.5 units.

,,,, And since in the right angle ""ADC"", ""DB"" (or MP) has been drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the base, therefore ""DB"" is a mean proportional between the the segments of the base, ""AB"" and ""BC"". If you now measure ""DB"" (or MP), you should find it equals 78.0769, which is not only the square root of 6096 as you originally had sought, and the root of its its factors 127 and 48, but 78.0769 / 48 = 1.6266 and 127 / 78.0769 = 1.6266 as well.

Understand the difference between the two forms of induction.,
State the proposition to be proved using strong induction.,
Prove the base case holds true.,
State the (strong) inductive hypothesis.,
Prove the ""strong"" inductive hypothesis holds true for the next value in the chain.,
Conclude the proposition is validly proved by strong mathematical induction.",How to Do Induction Proofs2," The above example is that of so-called ""weak"" induction, named so not because of a difference in quality between the two induction methods but rather to illustrate a difference between what is assumed in the inductive hypothesis of each type of proof. The two proof techniques are actually equivalent, it is just sometimes necessary to assume more in the inductive hypothesis in order to prove the proposition at hand.To return to our domino analogy, sometimes the weight of assuming P(k) is true is not sufficient enough to knock down the domino represented by P(k + 1). Sometimes you need to be able to knock down all the dominoes before it in order to prove that your proposition holds.

, To illustrate this, let us consider a different example. Let's say you are asked to prove true the proposition that all integers greater than 1 can be written as the product of prime numbers.As before, we will refer to this proposition as P(n), where ""n"" is the number that can be expressed as a product of primes.
Since we are talking about all integers greater than 1, ""n"" will have to be greater than, or equal to, 2.
Remember that a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can only be divided, without a remainder, by itself and 1.

, As before, the first step in any induction proof is to prove that the base case holds true. In this case, we will use 2. Since 2 is a prime number (only divisible by itself and 1), we can conclude the base case holds true.

, Here is where the difference between ""weak"" and ""strong"" induction presents itself most clearly, as this step is the only difference between the two forms of inductive proof. The inductive hypothesis for ""weak"" induction would assume that for some arbitrary value of ""n""—again, let's use ""k""—that the proposition holds. We would then use that assumption to prove that the next value in the chain is true, allowing us to conclude our proposition is valid overall. However, for this proposition, assuming P(k) is true tells us nothing about P(k + 1). This type of ""weak"" assumption is insufficient here, so we will need to assume more. The inductive hypothesis for ""strong"" induction, instead of simply assuming that P(k) is true, assumes that, for all values of ""n"" between the base case and ""k,"" that the proposition is true.We will use this comparatively stronger assumption (i.e., we are assuming more) to prove the proposition true.


This type of ""strong"" assumption is what differentiates the two forms of proof.
In this case, we will assume that, for some value of k ≥ 2, that each integer ""n"" such that 2 ≤ n ≤ k may be written as the product of primes., We will now use this strong assumption to prove that P(k + 1) also holds true, thereby proving the validity of our proposition overall. There are two relevant outcomes for ""k + 1."" If ""k + 1"" is a prime number, our proposition holds, and we are done. If ""k + 1"" is not a prime number, it will have a smallest prime factor, which we will denote as ""p."" Therefore, ""k + 1"" can be expressed as the product of ""p"" and some other number, ""x."" Since ""x"" will necessarily be less than ""k,"" our inductive hypothesis tells us that ""x"" can be written as a product of primes, which ultimately means that—regardless of whether ""k + 1"" is prime or not—it can be written as a product of prime numbers.

, Using our ""strong"" inductive hypothesis, we were able to prove our proposition held when ""weak"" induction would have been insufficient to do so. Try ""weak"" induction first, because the fact that you are assuming less theoretically makes the logic behind the proof stronger, contrary to the naming conventions used for these two types of proofs. Mathematically, though, the two forms of induction are equivalent.

Slope Intercept Equation of vertical and horizontal lines

Vertical Lines
The Equation of a vertical line is either x = b or x = k, some constant.
Since a vertical line goes straight up and down, its slope is undefined. Also, the x value of every point on a vertical line is the same. Therefore, whatever the x value is, is also the value of 'b', and the line intersects the y-axis. However, if x = k, the vertical line most probably does not intersect the y-axis (unless k=b).


Horizontal Lines

The equation of a horizontal line is y = b where b is the y-intercept.
Since the slope of a horizontal line is 0, the general formula for the slope-intercept form equation, y = mx + b, becomes y= 0x +b, or y = b. Also,since the line is horizontal, every point on that line has the exact same y value. This y-value is therefore also the y-axis intercept.

Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article Create Higher Exponential Powers Geometrically for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Do Garfield's Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem,",, We are interested to know the angle x formed where the the two side c's meet. Thinking about it, the original triangle was made of 180 degrees with the angle on the right at the far end of b, called theta, and the other angle at the top of a, being 90 degrees minus theta, as all the angles total 180 degrees and we already have one 90 degree angle.

, At the bottom, we have  theta, at the top left we have 90 degrees, and the top right we have 90 degrees minus theta.


The mystery angle x is 180 degrees. So theta + 90 degrees-theta + x = 180 degrees. Adding theta and negative theta gives us zero on the left, and subtracting 90 degrees from both sides leaves x equal to 90 degrees. So we have established that the mystery angle x = 90 degrees.







, First, the formula for a trapezoid is A= the Height x (Base1 + Base 2)/2. The height is a+b and (Base1 + Base 2)/2 = 1/2(a + b). So that all equals 1/2 (a+b)^2.

, We have the two smaller triangles at bottom and left, and those together equal 2*1/2(a*b), which just equals (a*b). Then we also have 1/2 c*c, or 1/2 c^2. So together we have the other formula for the area of the trapezoid equaling (a*b)+ 1/2 c^2.

, 1/2(a+b)^2=(a*b)+1/2 c^2. Now multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the 1/2's
2(1/2 (a+b)^2) = 2((a*b)+ 1/2 c^2.) which simplifies as (a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2.

Write the range with proper notation.",How to Find the Domain and Range of a Function," The domain of the function is all of the x-values (horizontal axis) that will give you a valid y-value output. The function equation may be quadratic, a fraction, or contain roots. To calculate the domain of the function, you must first evaluate the terms within the equation.


A quadratic function has the form ax2 + bx + c:f(x) = 2x2 + 3x + 4
Examples of functions with fractions include: f(x) = (1/x), f(x) = (x + 1)/(x - 1), etc.
Functions with a root include: f(x) = √x, f(x) = √(x2 + 1), f(x) = √-x, etc.;
, Writing the domain of a function involves the use of both brackets and parentheses (,). You use a bracket when the number is included in the domain and use a parenthesis when the domain does not include the number. The letter U indicates a union that connects parts of a domain that may be separated by a gap.For example, a domain of includes -2 and 2, but does not include number 10.
Always use parentheses if you are a using the infinity symbol, ∞.

, Quadratic equations make a parabolic graph that either points up or down. Given that the parabola will continue infinitely outward on the x-axis, the domain of most quadratic function is all real numbers. Stated another way, a quadratic equation encompasses all of the x-values on the number line, making its domain R (the symbol for all real numbers).To get an idea of the function choose any x-value and plug it into the function. Solving the function with this x-value will output a y-value. These x- and y-values are a coordinate (x, y) of the graph of the function.
Plot this coordinate and repeat the process with another x-value.
Plotting a few values in this fashion should give you a general idea of shape of the quadratic function.

, When working with a fraction, you can never divide by zero. By setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for x, you can calculate the values that will be excluded in the function.For example: Identify the domain of the function f(x) = (x + 1)/(x - 1).
The denominator of this function is (x - 1).
Set it equal to zero and solve for x: x – 1 = 0, x = 1.
Write the domain: The domain of this function cannot include 1, but includes all real numbers except 1; therefore, the domain is (-∞, 1) U (1, ∞).
(-∞, 1) U (1, ∞) can be read as the set of all real numbers excluding 1.The infinity symbol, ∞, represents all real numbers. In this case, all real numbers greater than 1 and less than one are included in the domain.

, You cannot take the square root of a negative number; therefore, any x-value that leads to a negative number must be excluded from the domain of that function.For example: Identify the domain of the function f(x) = √(x + 3).
The terms within the radical are (x + 3).
Set them greater than or equal to zero: (x + 3) ≥ 0.
Solve for x: x ≥ -3.
The domain of this function includes all real numbers greater than or equal to -3; therefore, the domain is [-3, ∞).

, A quadratic function has the form ax2 + bx + c: f(x) = 2x2 + 3x + 4. The shape of a quadratic function on a graph is parabola pointing up or down. There are different methods to calculating the range of a function depending on the type you are working with.The easiest way to identify the range of other functions, such as root and fraction functions, is to draw the graph of the function using a graphing calculator.

, The vertex of a quadratic function is the tip of the parabola. Remember, a quadratic equation is of the form ax2 + bx + c. To find the x-coordinate use the equation x = -b/2a. This equation is a derivative of the basic quadratic function which represents the equation with a zero slope (at the vertex of the graph, the slope of the function is zero).For example, find the range of 3x2 + 6x -2.
Calculate x-coordinate of vertex: x = -b/2a = -6/(2*3) = -1

, Plug the x-coordinate into the function to calculate the corresponding y-value of the vertex. This y-value denotes the edge of your range for the function.


Calculate y-coordinate: y = 3x2 + 6x – 2 = 3(-1)2 + 6(-1) -2 = -5.
The vertex of this function is (-1, -5).

, Choose any other x-value and plug it into the function to calculate the corresponding y-value. If the y-value is above the vertex, the parabola continues to +∞. If the y-value is below the vertex, the parabola continues to -∞.


Use the x-value -2: y = 3x2 + 6x – 2 = y = 3(-2)2 + 6(-2) – 2 = 12 -12 -2 = -2.
This yields the coordinate (-2, -2).
This coordinate tells you that the parabola continues above the vertex (-1, -5); therefore, the range encompasses all y-values above -5.
The range of this function is [-5, ∞)

, Like the domain, the range is written with the same notation. Use a bracket when the number is included in the domain and use a parenthesis when the domain does not include the number. The letter U indicates a union that connects parts of a domain that may be separated by a gap.For example, a range of includes -2 and 2, but does not include number 10.
Always use parentheses if you are a using the infinity symbol, ∞.

, Oftentimes, it is easiest to determine the range of a function by simply graphing it. Many root functions have a range of (-∞, 0] or Some root functions will start above or below the x-axis. In this case, the range is determined by the point the root function starts. If the parabola starts at y = -4 and goes up, then the range is [-4, +∞).
The easiest way to graph a function is to use a graphing program or a graphing calculator.
If you do not have a graphing calculator, you can draw a rough sketch of a graph by plugging x-values into the function and getting the corresponding y-values. Plot these coordinates on the graph to get an idea of the shape of the graph.

, Once you have graphed the function, you should be able to clearly see the lowest point of the graph. If there is no obvious minimum, know that some functions will continue on to -∞.


A fraction function will include all points except those at the asymptote. They often have ranges such as (-∞, 6) U (6, ∞).

, Again, after graphing, you should be able to identify the maximum point of the function. Some functions will continue on to +∞ and therefore, will not have a maximum.

, Like the domain, the range is written with the same notation. Use a bracket when the number is included in the domain and use a parenthesis when the domain does not include the number. The letter U indicates a union that connects parts of a domain that may be separated by a gap.For example, a range of includes -2 and 2, but does not include number 10.
Always use parentheses if you are a using the infinity symbol, ∞.

Verify that the figures are similar.,
Find a corresponding side length on each figure.,
Set up a ratio.,
Simplify the ratio.",How to Find Scale Factor1," Similar figures, or shapes, are ones in which the angles are congruent, and the side lengths are in proportion. Similar figures are the same shape, only one figure is bigger than the other.The problem should tell you that the shapes are similar, or it might show you that the angles are the same, and otherwise indicate that the side lengths are proportional, to scale, or that they correspond to each other. 
;
, You may need to rotate or flip the figure so that the two shapes align and you can identify the corresponding side lengths. You should be given the length of these two sides, or should be able to measure them.If you do not know at least one side length of each figure, you cannot find the scale factor.

For example, you might have a triangle with a base that is 15 cm long, and a similar triangle with a base that is 10 cm long. 


, For each pair of similar figures, there are two scale factors: one you use when scaling up, and one you use when scaling down. If you are scaling up from a smaller figure to a larger one, use the ratio Scale Factor=largerlengthsmallerlength{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {largerlength}{smallerlength}}}. If you are scaling down from a larger figure to a smaller one, use the ratio Scale Factor=smallerlengthlargerlength{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {smallerlength}{largerlength}}}.For example if you are scaling down from a triangle with a 15 cm base to one with a 10 cm base, you would use the ratio Scale Factor=smallerlengthlargerlength{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {smallerlength}{largerlength}}}.Filling in the appropriate values, it becomes Scale Factor=1015{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {10}{15}}}.


, The  simplified ratio, or fraction, will give you your scale factor. If you are scaling down, your scale factor will be a proper fraction.If you are scaling up, it will be a whole number or improper fraction, which you can convert to a decimal.

For example, the ratio 1015{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{15}}} simplifies to 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}}. So the scale factor of two triangles, one with a base of 15 cm and one with a base of 10 cm, is 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}}.


"
"
Find the side lengths of the figure.,
Determine whether you are scaling up or down.,
Multiply one side length by the scale factor.,
Find the remaining side lengths of the figure.",How to Find Scale Factor2," You should have one figure of which the side lengths are given or measurable. If you cannot determine the side lengths of the figure, you cannot make a similar figure.

For example, you might have a right triangle with sides measuring 4 cm and 3 cm, and a hypotenuse 5 cm long.


, If you are scaling up, your missing figure will be larger, and the scale factor will be a whole number, improper fraction, or decimal. If you are scaling down your missing figure will be smaller, and your scale factor will most likely be a proper fraction.

For example, if the scale factor is 2, then you are scaling up, and the similar figure will be larger than the one you have.


, The scale factor should be given to you. When you multiply the side length by the scale factor, this gives you the missing corresponding side length on the similar figure.For example, if the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 5 cm long, and the scale factor is 2, to find the hypotenuse of the similar triangle, you would calculate 5×2=10{\displaystyle 5\times 2=10}. So the similar triangle has a hypotenuse that is 10 cm long.


, Continue to multiply each side length by the scale factor. This will give you the corresponding side lengths of the missing figure.

For example, if the base of a right triangle is 3 cm long, with a scale factor of 2, you would calculate 3×2=6{\displaystyle 3\times 2=6} to find the base of the similar triangle. If the height of a right triangle is 4 cm long, with a scale factor of 2 you would calculate 4×2=8{\displaystyle 4\times 2=8} to find the height of the similar triangle.

Find the scale factor of these similar figures: a rectangle with a height of 6 cm, and a rectangle with a height of 54 cm.,
Try this problem.,
Use the scale factor to answer this problem.",How to Find Scale Factor3,"

Create a ratio comparing the two heights. Scaling up, the ratio is Scale Factor=546{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {54}{6}}}. Scaling down, the ratio is Scale Factor=654{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {6}{54}}}.

Simplify the ratio. The ratio 546{\displaystyle {\frac {54}{6}}} simplifies to 91=9{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{1}}=9}. The ratio 654{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{54}}} simplifies to 19{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{9}}}. So the two rectangles have a scale factor of 9{\displaystyle 9} or 19{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{9}}}.


, An irregular polygon is 14 cm long at its widest point. A similar irregular polygon is 8 inches at its widest point. What is the scale factor?

Irregular figures can be similar if all of their sides are in proportion. Thus, you can calculate a scale factor using any dimension you are given.Since you know the width of each polygon, you can set up a ratio comparing them. Scaling up, the ratio is Scale Factor=148{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {14}{8}}}. Scaling down, the ratio is Scale Factor=814{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {8}{14}}}.

Simplify the ratio. The ratio 148{\displaystyle {\frac {14}{8}}} simplifies to 74=134=1.75{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{4}}=1{\frac {3}{4}}=1.75}. The ratio 814{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{14}}} simplifies to 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}}. So the two irregular polygons have a scale factor of 1.75{\displaystyle 1.75} or 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}}.


, Rectangle ABCD is 8cm x 3cm. Rectangle EFGH is a larger, similar rectangle. Using a scale factor of 2.5, what is the area of Rectangle EFGH?

Multiply the height of Rectangle ABCD by the scale factor. This will give you the height of Rectangle EFGH: 3×2.5=7.5{\displaystyle 3\times 2.5=7.5}.

Multiply the width of Rectangle ABCD by the scale factor. This will give you the width of Rectangle EFGH: 8×2.5=20{\displaystyle 8\times 2.5=20}.

Multiply the height and width of Rectangle EFGH to find the area: 7.5×20=150{\displaystyle 7.5\times 20=150}. So, the area of Rectangle EFGH is 150 square centimeters.

Divide the molar mass of the compound by that of the empirical formula.,
Multiply the empirical formula by the scaling factor.,
Write the answer.",How to Find Scale Factor4," When you have the empirical formula of a chemical compound and you need to find the molecular formula of that same chemical compound, you can find the scaling factor you need by dividing the molar mass of the compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula.

For example, you might need to find the molar mass of an H2O compound with a molar mass of 54.05 g/mol. 

The molar mass of H2O is 18.0152 g/mol.

Find the scaling factor by dividing the molar mass of the compound by the molar mass of the empirical formula:

Scaling factor = 54.05 / 18.0152 = 3




, Multiply the subscripts of each element within the empirical formula by the scaling factor you just calculated. This will give you the molecular formula of the chemical compound sample involved in the problem.

For example, to find the molecular formula of the compound in question, multiply the subscripts of H20 by the scaling factor of 3.

H2O * 3 = H6O3




, With this answer, you have successfully found the answer for the empirical formula as well as the molecular formula of the chemical compound involved in the problem.

For example, the scaling factor for the compound is 3. The molecular formula of the compound is H6O3.

Set up the formula for surface area of a cube.,

Set up the formula for the volume of a cube.,
Plug the length of one edge into the formula.,
Cube the length of one edge.",How to Find the Volume of a Cube from Its Surface Area," The formula is surfacearea=6x2{\displaystyle surfacearea=6x^{2}}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the length of one edge of the cube.To find the volume of a cube, you need to multiply its three dimensions (length, width, height) together.These dimensions correspond to the length of the edges of the cube. Since all the dimensions (edges) of a cube are the same, in order to find the volume of the cube, you first have to determine the length of one of its edges. Since finding the surface area of a cube also requires the length of one edge, if you know the surface area, you can work backwards to find the length of one edge, then use the edge length to work forward to find the volume.
;
, This information should be given.

If you do not know the surface area of the cube, this method will not work.

If you already know the length of one edge of the cube, you can skip the following steps and plug in that value for x{\displaystyle x} into the volume of a cube formula: volume=x3{\displaystyle volume=x^{3}}.

For example, if the surface area of your cube is 96 square centimeters, your formula will look like this:96cm2=6x2{\displaystyle 96cm^{2}=6x^{2}}


, This will give you the value of x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}.

For example, if the surface area of your cube is 96 square centimeters, you would divide 96 by 6:96cm2=6x2{\displaystyle 96cm^{2}=6x^{2}}966=6x26{\displaystyle {\frac {96}{6}}={\frac {6x^{2}}{6}}}16=x2{\displaystyle 16=x^{2}}


, This will give you the value of x{\displaystyle x}, or the length of one edge of the cube.

You can find the square root using a calculator, or by hand. For complete instructions, read Calculate a Square Root by Hand.

For example, if 16=x2{\displaystyle 16=x^{2}}, then you need to find the square root of 16:16=x2{\displaystyle 16=x^{2}}16=x2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {16}}={\sqrt {x^{2}}}}4=x{\displaystyle 4=x}So, the length of one edge for a cube with a surface area of 96cm2{\displaystyle 96cm^{2}} is 4cm{\displaystyle 4cm}.


, The formula is v=x3{\displaystyle v=x^{3}}, where v{\displaystyle v} equals the volume of the cube, and x{\displaystyle x} equals the length of one edge., You should have already calculated this from the given surface area.

For example, if one edge of a cube is 4 centimeters, then your formula will look like this:v=43{\displaystyle v=4^{3}}.


, To do this, you can use a calculator, or simply multiply x by itself three times. This will give you the volume of your cube, in cubic units.

For example, if the length of one edge is 4 centimeters, you would calculate:v=43{\displaystyle v=4^{3}}v=4×4×4{\displaystyle v=4\times 4\times 4}v=64{\displaystyle v=64}So, the volume of a cube with an edge length of 4 centimeters is 64cm3{\displaystyle 64cm^{3}}

Join the points using free-hand drawing or a French curve tool (more accurate).",How to Hand Draw an Ellipse,"

The major axis is the longest diameter of an ellipse.;
,,


This is done by taking the length of the major axis and dividing it by two.

,


This is started by taking the compass and setting the spike on the midpoint, then extending the pencil to either end of the major axis.

,

The minor axis is the shortest diameter of an ellipse.

,



Here, you take the protractor and set its origin on the mid-point of the major axis. Mark the point at 90 degrees. Then swing the protractor 180 degrees and mark that point. Now you can draw the minor axis at its midpoint between or within the two marks.

,


Do it the same way the previous circle was made.

,


This is done by setting your protractor on the major axis on the origin and marking the 30 degree intervals with dots. Then you can connect the dots through the center with lines.

,


These will be parallel to the major axis, and go outward from all the points where the inner circle and 30 degree lines intersect. Try to draw the lines near the minor axis a little shorter, but draw them a little longer as you move toward the major axis.

,


These will be parallel to the minor axis, and go inward from all the points where the outer circle and 30 degree lines intersect. Try to draw the lines near the minor axis a little longer, but draw them a little shorter as you move toward the major axis. If you detect a horizontal line will be too short you can take a ruler and extend it a little before drawing the vertical line.

Learn Euler's Formula.,
Rearrange the formula to find the number of vertices.,
Plug the numbers in and solve.",How to Find the Vertex1," Euler's Formula, as it is used in reference to geometry and graphs, states that for any polyhedron that does not intersect itself, the number of faces plus the number of vertices, minus the number of edges, will always equal two.Written out as an equation, the formula looks like: F + V - E = 2


F refers to the number of faces

V refers to the number of vertices, or corner points

E refers to the number of edges

;
, If you know how many faces and edges the polyhedron has, you can quickly count the number of vertices by using Euler's Formula. Subtract F from both sides of the equation and add E to both sides, isolating V on one side.


V = 2 - F + E

, All you need to do at this point is to plug the number of sides and edges into the equation before adding and subtracting like normal. The answer you get should tell you the number of vertices and complete the problem.


Example: For a polyhedron that has 6 faces and 12 edges...

V = 2 - F + E
V = 2 - 6 + 12
V = -4 + 12
V = 8

Set up the formula for the surface area of a regular pyramid.,
Plug the perimeter of the base into the formula.,
Plug the value of the slant height into the formula.,
Calculate the area of the base.,
Plug the area of the base into the formula.,
Multiply the perimeter of the base and the slant height of the pyramid.,
Add the two values together.",How to Find the Surface Area of a Pyramid1," The formula is SA=p×h2+B{\displaystyle SA={\frac {p\times h}{2}}+B}, where SA{\displaystyle SA} equals the total surface area of the pyramid, p{\displaystyle p} equals the perimeter of the base, h{\displaystyle h} equals the slant height of the pyramid, and B{\displaystyle B} equals the area of the base.The basic formula for the surface area of any pyramid, regular or irregular, is Total Surface Area = Base Area + Lateral Area.Don’t confuse “slant height” with “height.” The “slant height” is the diagonal distance from the apex of the pyramid to the edge of the base.The “height” is the perpendicular distance from the vertex to the base.
;
, If you aren’t given the perimeter but know the length of one edge of the base, you can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one edge by the number of edges.

For example, If you are finding the surface area of a hexagonal pyramid, and you know that the length of one edge of the base is 4 cm, you would calculate 4×6=24{\displaystyle 4\times 6=24} to find the perimeter of the base, since a hexagon has six edges, or sides. Thus, the perimeter of the base is 24 cm, so your surface area formula will look like this: SA=24×h2+B{\displaystyle SA={\frac {24\times h}{2}}+B}.


, Make sure you are using the slant height, not the perpendicular height. The problem should provide the slant height. If you don’t know the slant height, you cannot use this method.

For example, if the slant height of a hexagonal pyramid is 12 cm, your formula will look like this: SA=24×122+B{\displaystyle SA={\frac {24\times 12}{2}}+B}.


, How you do this will depend on the shape of the base. To learn more about finding the area of a polygon, read Find the Area of Regular Polygons.

For example, if you are working with a hexagonal pyramid, the base is a hexagon. To find out how to calculate the area of the base, you can read Calculate the Area of a Hexagon. The formula is A=33×s22{\displaystyle A={\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}\times s^{2}}{2}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} is the length of one side of the hexagon. Since the length of one side of the hexagon is 4 cm, you would calculate: A=33×422{\displaystyle A={\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}\times 4^{2}}{2}}}A=33×162{\displaystyle A={\frac {3{\sqrt {3}}\times 16}{2}}}A=4832{\displaystyle A={\frac {48{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}}A=83.142{\displaystyle A={\frac {83.14}{2}}}A=41.57{\displaystyle A=41.57}.So the area of the base is 41.57 square centimeters.


, Make sure you substitute for the variable B{\displaystyle B}.

For example, if the area of the hexagonal base is 41.57 sq. cm., your formula for surface area will now look like this: SA=24×122+41.57{\displaystyle SA={\frac {24\times 12}{2}}+41.57}.


, Then, divide by two. This will give you the lateral surface area of the pyramid.

For example:SA=24×122+41.57{\displaystyle SA={\frac {24\times 12}{2}}+41.57}SA=2882+41.57{\displaystyle SA={\frac {288}{2}}+41.57}SA=144+41.57{\displaystyle SA=144+41.57}


, The sum will be the lateral surface area, plus the base surface area, providing you with the total surface area for the pyramid, in square units.

For example:SA=144+41.57{\displaystyle SA=144+41.57}SA=185.57{\displaystyle SA=185.57}So, the total surface area of a hexagonal pyramid, given a base edge length of 4 cm and a slant height of 12 cm, is 185.57 square centimeters.

You may also have a fraction, with one polynomial as the numerator and a binomial as the denominator. You should recognize this as an opportunity to perform division.For example, a division problem could be stated as, “Find the quotient when 3x2+20x+12{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+20x+12} is divided by x+6{\displaystyle x+6}.”

The same problem could ask you, “One factor of 3x2+20x+12{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+20x+12} is x+6{\displaystyle x+6}. What is the other factor?”

Finally, the exact same problem may just appear as 3x2+20x+12x+6{\displaystyle {\frac {3x^{2}+20x+12}{x+6}}}. You should recognize that the fraction form means to divide the numerator by the denominator.
;
, Just as you would with numbers, begin by drawing a long division symbol, something like this:  )¯¯¯¯¯¯ . The polynomial that is your dividend goes in the space under the symbol. The divisor is placed to the left of the symbol.The ""dividend"" is the large term whose factors you are trying to find. The ""divisor"" is the factor that you are dividing by. The ""quotient"" is the answer of any division problem.

With polynomials, this problem will look like: x+6)3x2+20x+12¯{\displaystyle x+6{\overline {)3x^{2}+20x+12}}}.


, When you are doing long division with numbers, you don’t try to divide the entire number in one step. You look at the first one or two numbers of the dividend and estimate how many times the first digit of the divisor will go into that. You will do the same with polynomial division. Look at the first term of the divisor and decide how many times that will go into the first term of the dividend.For example, if you are dividing 642 by 3, you begin by considering how many times 3 will divide into the first digit of 642. Three goes into six twice, so you will write a 2 above the 6 over the division line. 

For the polynomial division, consider the first term of the dividend, 3x2{\displaystyle 3x^{2}} and the first term of the divisor, x{\displaystyle x}. 3x2{\displaystyle 3x^{2}} divided by x{\displaystyle x} leaves a factor of 3x{\displaystyle 3x}. Write 3x{\displaystyle 3x} above the 3x2{\displaystyle 3x^{2}} under the division symbol.


, With the first time of your quotient set above the bar line, now multiply that by the full divisor. Write the result underneath the dividend.With 3x{\displaystyle 3x} as the first term of your quotient, multiply 3x{\displaystyle 3x} by x+6{\displaystyle x+6}. Do this by multiplying 3x by each term. First do 3x∗x{\displaystyle 3x*x} and then 3x∗+6{\displaystyle 3x*+6}. Write the result, 3x2+18x{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+18x} underneath the first two terms of the polynomial 3x2+20x{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+20x}.


, Just as the next step in long division is to subtract your result from the original number, in this problem you will subtract the polynomial minus the binomial you just wrote down. You should have written your previous step underneath similar terms of the polynomial, so you can simply subtract downward. Draw a line underneath the lower binomial and subtract.In the running example, the first terms should line up to subtract 3x2−3x2{\displaystyle 3x^{2}-3x^{2}}. This cancels out to zero. Then subtract the second terms, 20x−18x{\displaystyle 20x-18x}. Below the subtraction line, write your answer of 2x{\displaystyle 2x}.


, In numerical long division, you would now bring down the next digit of the number. In polynomial long division, copy down the next term of the polynomial.In this example, the next (and last) term of the polynomial is +12{\displaystyle +12}. Copy that down to the bottom, next to the 2x{\displaystyle 2x}, to create the binomial 2x+12{\displaystyle 2x+12}.


, Compare this new dividend, 2x+2{\displaystyle 2x+2} to the divisor x+6{\displaystyle x+6}. Consider how many times the first term, 2x{\displaystyle 2x} can divide the first term of the divisor x{\displaystyle x}. 2x{\displaystyle 2x} divided by x{\displaystyle x} is {\displaystyle }. Write this result, {\displaystyle } as the next term of your quotient at the top of the problem.Because the {\displaystyle } is positive, write it as +2{\displaystyle +2}. This will give the quotient of 3x+2{\displaystyle 3x+2} above the division line.


, Continue the process by multiplying.In this example, multiply the +2{\displaystyle +2} times each term of the divisor x+6{\displaystyle x+6}. This will give the result 2x+12{\displaystyle 2x+12}. Write this result at the bottom of the long division problem, lining up the terms with the result of your prior subtraction.


, Line up common terms and then subtract. The binomial at the bottom of the problem from your prior subtraction was 2x+12{\displaystyle 2x+12}. Underneath that is the latest product, which is also 2x+12{\displaystyle 2x+12}. When you subtract each term, the result will be zero., When you have used all the terms of the initial polynomial, and your subtraction cancels out all terms to zero, you are done with the long division. The result of 3x2+20x+12{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+20x+12} divided by x+6{\displaystyle x+6} is 3x+2{\displaystyle 3x+2}.Alternatively, if working with the problem in fraction form, the result will look like this:


3x2+20x+12x+6=(3x+2)(x+6)x+6=3x+2{\displaystyle {\frac {3x^{2}+20x+12}{x+6}}={\frac {(3x+2)(x+6)}{x+6}}=3x+2}

Substitute the slope in this equation.,
Replace x and y with the coordinates of the point.,
Solve for b.,
Write this as a coordinate point.",How to Find the Y Intercept1," The slope or ""rise over run"" is a single number that tells you how steep the line is. This type of problem also gives you the (x,y) coordinate of one point along the graph. Skip to the other methods below if you don't have both these pieces of information.


Example 1: A straight line with slope 2 contains the point (3,4). Find the y-intercept of this line using the steps below.
;
, Any straight line can be written as an equation in the form y = mx + b. When the equation is in this form, the variable m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.
, Write the slope-intercept equation, but instead of m, use the slope of your line.


Example 1 (cont.): y = mx + bm = slope = 2y = 2x + b


, Any time you have the coordinates of a single point on your line, you can substitute those x and y coordinates for the x and y in your line equation. Do this for the equation you've been working on.


Example 1 (cont.): The point (3,4) is on this line. At this point, x = 3 and y = 4.Substitute these values into y = 2x +b:4 = 2(3) + b


, Remember, b is the y-intercept of the line. Now that b is the only variable in the equation, rearrange to solve for this variable and find the answer.


Example 1 (cont.): 4 = 2(3) + b4 = 6 + b4 - 6 = b-2 = bThe y-intercept of this line is -2.


, The y-intercept is the point where the line intersects with the y-axis. Since the y-axis is located at x = 0, the x coordinate of the y-intercept is always 0.


Example 1 (cont.): The y-intercept is at y = -2, so the coordinate point is (0, -2).

Graph the solutions of the system of linear inequalities.,
Change the inequalities to equations.,
Substitute one variable for the other.,
Solve for the first variable.,
Solve for the remaining variable.,
Determine the vertex.",How to Find the Vertex2," In some instances, graphing the solutions for all inequalities in the system can visually show you where some, if not all, of the vertices lie. When it does not, however, you will need to find the vertex algebraically.


If using a graphing calculator to graph the inequalities, you can usually scroll over to the vertices and find the coordinates that way.

, In order to solve for the system of inequalities, you will need to temporarily change the inequalities to equations, allowing you the ability to find values for x and y.


Example: For the system of inequalities:

y < x
y > -x + 4


Change the inequalities to:

y = x
y = -x + 4



, While there are a couple of different ways you can solve for x and y, substitution is often the easiest to use. Plug the value of y from one equation into the other equation, effectively ""substituting"" y in the other equation with additional x values.


Example: If:

y = x
y = -x + 4


Then y = -x + 4 can be written as:

x = -x + 4



, Now that you only have one variable in the equation, you can easily solve for that variable, x, as you would in any other equation: by adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying.


Example: x = -x + 4

x + x = -x + x + 4
2x = 4
2x / 2 = 4 / 2
x = 2



, Plug your new value for x into one of the original equations to find the value of y.


Example: y = x

y = 2



, The vertex is simply the coordinate consisting of your new x and y values.


Example: (2, 2)

Calculate the midway point.,
Plug the x value into the original equation.,
Write down the vertex point.",How to Find the Vertex3," Rewrite the quadratic equation in its factored form. There are several ways to factor out a quadratic equation, but when done, you should be left with two sets of parentheses that, when multiplied together, equal your original equation.


Example: (using decomposition)

3x2 - 6x - 45
Factor out the common factor: 3 (x2 - 2x - 15)
Multiply the a and c terms: 1 * -15 = -15
Find two numbers with a product that equals -15 and a sum that equals the b value, -2: 3 * -5 = -15; 3 - 5 = -2
Substitute the two values into the equation ax2 + kx + hx + c: 3(x2 + 3x - 5x - 15)
Factor the polynomial by grouping: f(x) = 3 * (x + 3) * (x - 5)



, This will occur when either set of factors equals 0.


Example: 3 * (x + 3) * (x - 5) = 0

х +3 = 0
х - 5 = 0
х = -3 ; х = 5
Therefore, the roots are: (-3, 0) and (5, 0)



, The axis of symmetry for the equation will lie directly in between the two roots of the equation. You need to know the axis of symmetry since the vertex lies on it.


Example: x = 1; this value lies directly between -3 and 5

, Plug the x value for your axis of symmetry into either equation for your parabola. The y value will be the y value for your vertex.


Example: y = 3x2 - 6x - 45 = 3(1)2 - 6(1) - 45 = -48

, At this point, your last calculated x and y values should give you the coordinates of your vertex.


Example: (1, -48)

Rewrite the original equation in its vertex form.The ""vertex"" form of an equation is written as y = a(x - h)^2 + k, and the vertex point will be (h, k).,
Isolate the a value.,
Find a third term for the parentheses.,
Simplify the equation.,
Figure out what the coordinates are based on the vertex equation.",How to Find the Vertex4," Your current quadratic equation will need to be rewritten into this form, and in order to do that, you'll need to complete the square.


Example: y = -x^2 - 8x - 15

, Factor out the coefficient of the first term, a from the first two terms in the equation. Leave the final term, c, alone for now.


Example: -1 (x^2 + 8x) - 15

, The third term must complete the set in the parentheses so that the values in parentheses form a perfect square. This new term is the squared value of half the coefficient of the middle term.


Example: 8 / 2 = 4; 4 * 4 = 16; therefore,

-1(x^2 + 8x + 16)
Also keep in mind that what you do to the inside must also be done to the outside:
y = -1(x^2 + 8x + 16) - 15 + 16



, Since your parentheses now form a perfect square, you can simplify the parenthetical portion to its factored form. Simultaneously, you can do any addition or subtraction needed to the values outside of the parentheses.


Example: y = -1(x + 4)^2 + 1

, Recall that the vertex form of an equation is y = a(x - h)^2 + k, with (h, k) representing the coordinates of the vertex. You now have enough information to plug values into the h and k slots and complete the problem.


k = 1
h = -4
Therefore, the vertex of this equation can be found at: (-4, 1)


"
"
Find the x coordinate of the vertex directly.,
Plug this value into the original equation.,
Write down your vertex coordinates.",How to Find the Vertex5," When the equation of your parabola can be written as y = ax^2 + bx + c, the x of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b / 2a. Simply plug the a and b values from your equation into this formula to find x.


Example: y = -x^2 - 8x - 15
x = -b / 2a = -(-8)/(2*(-1)) = 8/(-2) = -4
x = -4

, By plugging a value for x into the equation, you can solve for y. This y value will be the y coordinate of your vertex.


Example: y = -x^2 - 8x - 15 = -(-4)^2 - 8(-4) - 15 = -(16) - (-32) - 15 = -16 + 32 - 15 = 1

y = 1



, The x and y values you have are the coordinates of your vertex point.


Example: (-4, 1)

Set up the formula for surface area of a square pyramid.,
Plug in the values for the side length and slant height into the formula.,
Square the side length of the base.,
Multiply the side length of the base by the slant height and divide by two.,
Add the base surface area and the lateral surface area.",How to Find the Surface Area of a Pyramid2," The formula is SA=b2+4(bh2){\displaystyle SA=b^{2}+4({\frac {bh}{2}})}, where b{\displaystyle b} is equal to the length of one side of the base, and h{\displaystyle h} is equal to the slant height of the pyramid.

Don’t confuse “slant height” with “height.” The “slant height” is the diagonal distance from the apex of the pyramid to the edge of the base.The “height” is the perpendicular distance from the vertex to the base.

Note that this formula is just another way of writing Total Surface Area = Base Area (b2{\displaystyle b^{2}}) + Lateral Area (4(bh2){\displaystyle 4({\frac {bh}{2}})}). This formula only works for regular square pyramids.


, Make sure you substitute the side length of the base for b{\displaystyle b} and the slant height for h{\displaystyle h}.

For example, if the length of one side of the base of a square pyramid is 4 cm, and the slant height is 12 cm, the formula will look like this: SA=42+4((4)(12)2){\displaystyle SA=4^{2}+4({\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})}.


, This will give you the surface area of the base.

For example:SA=42+4((4)(12)2){\displaystyle SA=4^{2}+4({\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})}SA=16+4((4)(12)2){\displaystyle SA=16+4({\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})}


, Then, multiply by 4. This will give you the lateral surface area of the pyramid.

For example:SA=16+4((4)(12)2){\displaystyle SA=16+4({\frac {(4)(12)}{2}})}SA=16+4(482){\displaystyle SA=16+4({\frac {48}{2}})}SA=16+4(24){\displaystyle SA=16+4(24)}SA=16+96{\displaystyle SA=16+96}


, This will give you the total surface area of the pyramid, in square units.

For example:SA=16+96{\displaystyle SA=16+96}SA=112{\displaystyle SA=112}So, the total surface area of a square pyramid, with a base side length of 4 cm and a slant height of 12 cm, is 112 square centimeters.

Set up the problem.,
Follow the same steps as before.,
Continue to the end.,
Report your result.",How to Do Long Division with Polynomials2," Just as you would with a simpler problem, write your dividend underneath the long division bar and your divisor to the left of it.Suppose you are asked to find the quotient of 4x3+9x2−x−6{\displaystyle 4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6} divided by x+2{\displaystyle x+2}. Set the longer polynomial 4x3+9x2−x−6{\displaystyle 4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6} under the division bar and the divisor x+2{\displaystyle x+2} to the left. It will look like this:


x+2)4x3+9x2−x−6¯{\displaystyle x+2{\overline {)4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6}}}.




, Follow the same pattern of four long division steps as before: Estimate, Multiply, Subtract, Carry down. The only difference with a longer problem is that you will continue repeating the pattern more times.Consider the numerical long division problem 24)90,048¯{\displaystyle 24{\overline {)90,048}}}. You will begin by estimating 2 into 9, then carry down the 0, then you will eventually carry down the other 0, the 4, and then the 8. Each number represents a full round of “Estimate, Multiply, Subtract, Carry Down.”

With the longer polynomial long division, each of the terms in the dividend, 4x3{\displaystyle 4x^{3}}, 9x2{\displaystyle 9x^{2}}, −x{\displaystyle -x} and −6{\displaystyle -6} represents one full cycle of “Estimate, Multiply, Subtract, Carry Down.”


, Keep working until you get to the final subtraction and have no more terms to carry down. With this example problem, the division should work out evenly, so that the final subtraction gives a result of zero., Just as you would expect a larger number to be the quotient when you divide large numbers, you will likely have a longer polynomial as your quotient when doing a longer algebraic division problem.

In this example, the result of 4x3+9x2−x−6{\displaystyle 4x^{3}+9x^{2}-x-6} divided by x+2{\displaystyle x+2} is the trinomial 4x2+x−3{\displaystyle 4x^{2}+x-3}.

Subtract.,
Carry down the next term of the polynomial.,
Repeat the long division process.,
Multiply the last term of the quotient by the divisor.,
Subtract.,
Report your result.",How to Do Long Division with Polynomials3," When you start a polynomial long division problem, you will not know at the beginning whether or not you will have a remainder. Set up the problem just as you would with any long division.For example, suppose you have the problem x2+5x+9x+3{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}+5x+9}{x+3}}}. Set this up as:


x+3)x2+5x+9¯{\displaystyle x+3{\overline {)x^{2}+5x+9}}}.




, Look at the first term of the dividend and the first term of the divisor. Estimate the quotient and write the result above the bar line.In this example, the first term of the quotient is x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} and the first term of the divisor is x{\displaystyle x}. x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} divided by x{\displaystyle x} goes in x{\displaystyle x} times, so write the result x{\displaystyle x} above the division bar line.


, Find the partial product for the first step by multiplying your first estimate of the quotient by the divisor. Write your result underneath the dividend.For this problem, multiply the x{\displaystyle x} that you wrote above the bar line by the terms of the divisor x+3{\displaystyle x+3}. Write the result, x2+3x{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x} underneath the corresponding terms x2+5x{\displaystyle x^{2}+5x}.


, Draw a line underneath your last result and subtract term by term. Write the differences at the bottom of the problem.In this example, the first terms will cancel as x2−x2=0{\displaystyle x^{2}-x^{2}=0}.

The second term subtraction is 5x−3x{\displaystyle 5x-3x}. Write the result, 2x{\displaystyle 2x}, at the bottom of the problem.


, As before, copy the next term of the dividend polynomial down to the bottom and add it to the result from your subtraction step.In this case, the final term of the polynomial is +9{\displaystyle +9}. Copy this down to the bottom and add it to the 2x{\displaystyle 2x} from your previous step. This creates the binomial 2x+9{\displaystyle 2x+9}.


, Look at the first terms and decide how many times the x{\displaystyle x} of your divisor x+3{\displaystyle x+3} will go into the 2x{\displaystyle 2x} at the bottom. Write this result, {\displaystyle } above the division line at the top of the problem. This gives you a quotient of x+2{\displaystyle x+2}., Use the term that you just placed in the quotient to multiply the divisor. Write the result at the bottom of the long division problem.In this example, multiply the +2{\displaystyle +2} by each term of the divisor x+3{\displaystyle x+3}. Write the result, 2x+6{\displaystyle 2x+6} at the bottom. Align the common terms underneath each other. 


, Draw a line under your last step and subtract common terms.In the sample problem, this should leave the subtraction of 2x+9{\displaystyle 2x+9} minus 2x+6{\displaystyle 2x+6}. The first terms, 2x−2x{\displaystyle 2x-2x} will cancel out. The final subtraction is 9−6{\displaystyle 9-6}. This leaves a remainder of 3. Because there are no more terms of the dividend polynomial to carry down, your work is done, except for reporting your result.


, Remember how you handle remainders when dividing with only numbers. Before you learned to divide into decimal points, you learned to write the remainder as a fraction over the divisor. You do the same thing with polynomial division. You will write the remainder as the numerator of a fraction, with the divisor as the denominator.Consider the numerical example, 3)35¯{\displaystyle 3{\overline {)35}}}. This would give a result of 11, with a remainder of 2. You would write your answer as 1123{\displaystyle 11{\frac {2}{3}}}.

For the polynomial division, your quotient was x+2{\displaystyle x+2} with a remainder of 3{\displaystyle 3}. Write the remainder as a fraction over the divisor, so you report your full quotient as x+2+3x+3{\displaystyle x+2+{\frac {3}{x+3}}}.

Review the slope-intercept form.,
Fit the slope and point into the equation.,
Solve for b.",How to Find the Y Intercept2," This method covers problems that only tell you two points on a straight line. Write each point coordinate down in (x,y) form.
, Find the y-intercept of this line using the steps below.
, Slope is a measure of how much vertical distance the line moves for each unit of horizontal distance. You may have heard this described as ""rise over run"" (riserun{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}}). Here's how to find these two quantities from two points:

""Rise"" is the change in vertical distance, or the difference between the y-values of the two points.

""Run"" is the change in horizontal distance, or the difference between x-values of the same two points.


Example 2 (cont.): The y-values of the two points are 2 and -4, so the rise is (-4) - (2) = -6.The x-values of the two points (in the same order) are 1 and 3, so the run is 3 - 1 = 2.


, Now that you know these two values, plug them into ""riserun{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}}"" to find the slope of the line.


Example 2 (cont.): slope=riserun=−62={\displaystyle slope={\frac {rise}{run}}={\frac {-6}{2}}=} -3.


, You can describe a straight line with the formula y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Now that we know the slope m and a point (x,y), we can use this equation to solve for b, the y-intercept.
, Take the equation in slope-intercept form and replace m with the slope you calculated. Replace the x and y terms with the coordinates of a single point on the line. It doesn't matter which point you use.


Example 2 (cont.): y = mx + bSlope = m = -3, so y = -3x + bThe line includes a point with (x,y) coordinates (1,2), so 2 = -3(1) + b.


, Now the only variable left in the equation is b, the y-intercept. Rearrange the equation so b is on one side, and you have your answer. Remember, the y-intercept always has an x-coordinate of 0.


Example 2 (cont.): 2 = -3(1) + b2 = -3 + b5 = bThe y-intercept is at (0,5).

Find the y-intercept for a quadratic equation.",How to Find the Y Intercept3," If you already have the equation of the line, you can find the y-intercept with a little algebra.


Example 3: What is the y-intercept of the line x + 4y = 16?

Note: Example 3 is a straight line. See the end of this section for an example of a quadratic equation (with a variable raised to the power of 2).


, The y-axis is a vertical line along x = 0. This means any point on the y-axis has an x-coordinate of 0, including the y-intercept of the line. Plug in 0 for x in the line equation.


Example 3 (cont.): x + 4y = 16x = 00 + 4y = 164y = 16


, The answer is the y-intercept of the line.


Example 3 (cont.): 4y = 164y4=164{\displaystyle {\frac {4y}{4}}={\frac {16}{4}}}y = 4.The y-intercept of the line is 4.


, To check your answer, graph the equation as neatly as you can. The point where the line crosses the y-axis is the y-intercept.
, A quadratic equation includes a variable (x or y) raised to the power of 2. You can solve for y with the same substitution, but since the quadratic describes a curve, it could intercept the y-axis at 0, 1, or 2 points. This means you may end up with 0, 1, or 2 answers.


Example 4: To find the y-intercept of y2=x+1{\displaystyle y^{2}=x+1}, substitute x = 0 and solve the quadratic equation.In this case, we can solve y2=0+1{\displaystyle y^{2}=0+1} by taking the square root of both sides. Remember, when taking a square root, you must account for two answers: a negative and a positive.y2=1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {y^{2}}}={\sqrt {1}}}y = 1 or y = -1. These are both y-intercepts of this curve.

Look at the whole number.,
Set up a table for the remaining numbers.,
Fill in the numbers on the table.,
Compare the tenths column.,
Compare the hundredths column.,
Compare the smaller fractional place values.,
Order the numbers from least to greatest.",How to Order Decimals from Least to Greatest1," The quickest way to determine the least or greatest number is to compare their whole numbers. If one number has a larger whole number than the others, it is automatically the greatest number. If one number has a smaller whole number than the others, it is automatically the least number.

For example, if you are comparing the numbers 12.45, 12.457, and 11.47, compare the whole numbers: 12, 12, and 11. Since 11 is less than 12, you know that 11.47 is going to be the smallest, or least, number.
;
, The table should have one row for each number, and a column for each digit in the numbers. You should also add a row to include the decimal point.Label the place values above the table.

For example, since you are comparing 12.45 and 12.457, you will make a table with two rows and six columns--one column for each place value in the longest number, plus a column for the decimal point.

From left to right, the columns would be labeled tens, ones, decimal, tenths, hundredths, thousandths.


, Make sure the decimal points line up. If the numbers are different lengths, fill in zeros for any open columns.For example, since 12.45 has four digits, and 12.457 has five digits, you will need to add a 0 in the thousandths place for 12.45.


, If either number has a larger digit in the tenths column, it is the larger number. If the numbers have the same digit in the tenths column, you need to move on to compare the hundredths column.

For example, 12.45 and 12.457 both have a 4 in the tenths place, so you cannot tell yet which is greater.


, Again, compare the digits in this place value. If either number has a larger digit here, it is the larger number. If not, you need to move on to the thousandths column.

For example, 12.45 and 12.457 both have a 5 in the hundredths place, so you cannot tell yet which is greater.


, Keep comparing the digits in the columns of your table, until you find a number that has a larger digit. This will be the largest number.For example, 12.45 has a 0 in the thousandths place, and 12.457 has a 7 in the thousandths place. Thus, 12.457 is greater than 12.45.


, The smallest number should come first in your list, and the largest number should come last. The other numbers should be listed in between in ascending order.

For example, the numbers listed from least to greatest are 11.47, 12.45, 12.457. You can also write them using the less than symbol: 11.47 < 12.45 < 12.457.

, The multiplication of decimals is similar to that of whole numbers, with a few differences.


Remember that you do not need to line up the decimal point while you multiply, as you will be ignoring the decimal points as you do so. When you have your product, you will then count the total number of values behind the decimal point, and move the decimal point that number of places.

, If you had 0.25 as your product, for instance, you would multiply it by 100 to get a product of 25%.

,, For example, if you had 50% and 25%, you would rewrite them as 50/100 and 25/100. Then simplify as needed; in the given example, 50/100 would simplify to 1/2, and 25/100 would simplify to 1/4.

, Remember that when multiplying fractions, the denominators do not have to be the same; you will multiply the numerators and denominators. In the example above, 1/2 x 1/4 would equal 1/8, or 0.125.

, In the example above, your percentage value would be 12.5%, since 0.125 x 100 equals 12.5%.

Compare the whole numbers.,
Determine the first place value where the digits differ.,
Determine the two fractional numbers the the decimals fall between.,
Divide the number line into tenths.,
Plot the numbers you are comparing on the number line.,
Compare the location of each number on the number line.,
Write the numbers in order from least to greatest.",How to Order Decimals from Least to Greatest2," The quickest way to order decimals is to look at their whole numbers. If one whole number is greater than or less than the others, you know the decimal is greater than or less than the others.

For example, if you are comparing 14.36, and 13.458, and 14.369, you would compare 14, 13, and 14. Since 13 is less than 14, you know that 13.458 is the smallest number. 


, Moving from left-to-right, compare the digits in each place value. Noting where the numbers differ will help you set up your number line.

For example, 14.36 and 14.369 have the same digits until the thousandths place.


, These will be the first and last numbers you label on your number line. To find these numbers, look to the last place value where the numbers shared the same digit. This will be the first number on your number line. To find the last number, add 1 to the last place value the numbers shared.

For example, since the last place value where 14.36 and 14.369 share a digit is the hundredths place, the first number on the number line will be 14.36. Determine the last number by adding 1 to the hundredths place. So, the last number on the number line is 14.37.


, Since each new place value increases or decreases by a factor of 10, you should divide the line into tenths to represent the 10 smaller numbers that come between the first and last numbers on the number line.You do not need to label each number, but doing so can make it easier to plot the numbers you are comparing.

For example, between 14.36 and 14.37, you should label 14.361, 14.362, 14.363, 14.364, 14.365, 14.366, 14.367, 14.368, and 14.369. 


, If you labeled all the numbers on your number line, simply find the corresponding number and draw a dot. If you did not label, you will need to count the hash marks. If a number you are comparing does not fall directly on a labeled point of the number line, plot the number between two other numbers or hash marks.For example, if you are comparing 14.36 and 14.369, draw a dot on the first number of the number line to show 14.36. Draw a dot on the second-to-last number to show 14.369.


, On a number line, numbers grow larger left-to-right. So, the greatest number will be the farthest right on the number line, and the least number will be the farthest left on the number line.For example, since 14.369 is to the right of 14.36, then 14.369 is the larger number.


, The smallest number should be listed first, and the largest number should be listed last. The other numbers should be listed between these two, in ascending order.

For example, 13.458, 14.36, 14,369. You can also use the less than sign to show their relationship: 13.458 < 14.36 < 14,369.

Locate the decimal symbol.,
Learn place values for whole numbers.,
Learn the place value for fractional numbers.",How to Order Decimals from Least to Greatest3," A decimal symbol looks like a dot or period. (In Europe, the decimal symbol looks like a comma.) It separates the number into its whole and fractional parts.The digits to the left of a decimal symbol represent whole numbers. The digits to the right of the decimal symbol represent fractional numbers.

For example, if you have the decimal 12.38, the digits 1 and 2 represent whole numbers (the number 12), and the digits 3 and 8 represent fractional numbers (.38 is less than 1, or a fraction of 1).


, Place value indicates the value of a digit. A digit can have a different value, depending on where it is located in a number.From right to left, the place values are ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands, hundred-thousands, and millions.For example, In the number 51, the digit 5 is in the tens place. It has a value of 5 tens, or 50. But in the number 50,001, the digit 5 is in the ten-thousands place. It has a value of 5 ten-thousands, or 50,000. 

The smallest place value for whole numbers is the ones place. Once you have 10 ones, you exchange them for 1 ten. Thus, you have a 1 in the tens place, and a 0 in the ones place. Once you have 10 tens, you exchange them for 1 hundred. Thus, you have a 1 in the hundreds place, and a 0 in the tens and ones place. In other words, each new place value you add on increases by a factor of 10.This pattern continues for the higher place values. 

Note that place value gets larger from right-to-left. In a whole number, a digit has more value the farther away it is from the decimal point.


, Just like place value indicates the value of digit in a whole number, it also indicates the value of a digit in a fractional number. From left-to-right from the decimal symbol, the place values are tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, and millionths.For example, in the number 1.5, the digit 5 is in the tenths place. It has the value of 5 tenths, or 510{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10}}}. But in the number 1.0005, the digit 5 has a value of 5 ten-thousandths, or 510,000{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10,000}}}.

The largest place value for fractional numbers is the tenths place. You need 10 hundredths to make 1 tenth. You need 10 thousandths to make 1 hundredth. In other words, each new place value you add on decreases by a factor of 10.This pattern continues for the smaller place values.

Note that, similar to place value in whole numbers, place value in fractional numbers gets bigger moving from right-to-left. However, in a fractional number, a digit has less value the farther away it is from the decimal point. It is a common misconception that 1 tenth is less than 1 hundredth, since 1 ten is less than 1 hundred. However, 1 tenth is greater than 1 hundredth. When comparing fractional place value, it can help to think of the digits expressed as fractions:110>1100{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}>{\frac {1}{100}}}.

Convert both percentages to decimal.,
Divide the first decimal by the second one.,
Multiply the quotient by 100 to get a percent, or move the decimal point two places to the right.,
Rewrite the percentages as fractions with a denominator of 100.,
Simplify as needed.,
Divide the fractions.,
Simplify your answer if needed.,
Multiply your answer by 100 to get a percent.,
Add a percent (%) sign so others know that the number is being compared to 100.

",How to Multiply or Divide Two Percentages2," Do this by moving the decimal point two spaces to the left, or dividing them by 100. For example, 20% and 80% would be 0.2 and 0.8 as decimals.

, To do this, move the decimal point the number of spaces it would take to make the number whole, then divide as usual. In the example given above, 0.2/0.8 would give you a quotient of 0.25, since 2 divided by 8 equals 0.25.

, Then add a percent (%) sign so others know that the number is being compared to 100.

, For instance, if you had 80%, and 25%, you would get the fractional values of 80/100 and 25/100.

, In the example given above, 80/100 would simplify to 4/5, and 25/100 would simplify to 1/4.

, To do this, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second one (flip the second fraction over). In the example given above, you would multiply 4/5 by 4/1 (or 4) to get 16/5.

, If you're simplifying an improper fraction, it's best to convert it to a decimal rather than a mixed number, as converting a mixed number to percentage takes more work.

, In the example given above, you would multiply 16/5 (or 3.2) by 100 to get 320%.

Understand the math standards.,
Take an interest in homework.,
Be the student.",How to Get Kids Interested in Math2," Many states now use the Common Core State Standards, which you can find online.Knowing the math standards your children are learning ahead of time can help you avoid situations in which you can’t help them with their homework.


You can also use the standards to plan home-based learning experiences that extend the learning your child is doing in school., Make sure you are checking in with your children each day and reviewing homework together. This shows that you value math and expect your children to take it seriously. Checking their work also allows you to ensure they are showing all their work and understanding the concepts.Keeping track of what your children are learning can also help foster discussions with their teachers. If you identify areas your students are struggling in, contact their teachers to find out how you can help supplement school work.

, Have your children “tutor” you in certain math topics. Give them a problem, and then encourage them to research how to solve it by using their textbooks, teachers, or online tools. Then ask your children to tutor you in how to solve the problem. Students who teach others often better understand the concepts and perform better on tests.Find out your school’s math scope and sequence, and give your children problems using skills that are upcoming in the curriculum. This way they will be experts on the topics before they see them in the classroom, boosting their math confidence.
If your children needs motivation, offer to pay them some reward for their tutoring services.For example, you could pay them a monetary allowance for their help, or let them earn computer or TV time. Whatever the compensation, make sure you agree on it with your children in advance.

Be a good math role model.,
Introduce your child to a mathematician.,
Relate math to the real world.,
Create math rituals.",How to Get Kids Interested in Math3," Be careful not to express any math anxiety you may personally have. It’s important to show your child that anyone can use math to solve problems. By telling your child that you don’t understand math, you are giving him or her the impression that math is incomprehensible, and that it is okay to not be good at it.Let your child see you confidently doing math at home. Balance your checkbook, alter recipes, and make a grocery budget without complaining or expressing doubt in your abilities., If you personally know people who use math in their careers, have them talk to your child and share their positive experiences with math, and how math helps them in the real world. If you don’t know any mathematicians, introduce your child to a famous person who used math to change the world. Kids learn about famous authors and historical figures in school, but rarely do they learn about mathematicians.Some important mathematicians in history include Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, and Alan Turing.Famous female mathematicians include Katherine Johnson, Marjorie Lee Browne, and Mary Cartwright.Numerous children’s books have been written about some of these figures, such as Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton. Some of these books include On A Beam of Light by Jennifer Berne and Who Was Isaac Newton? by Janet Pascal.
You can do research online with your child to find biographical information about the mathematicians, as well as anecdotes and fun facts.
To make the activity fun, find pictures of the mathematician online. Then have your child dress up like the mathematician and read a report about him or her, or your child can explain how to apply one of the mathematician’s theorems.

, Provide your children with authentic learning experiences that show them how to use math in the real world. The more you expose your children to math, even in their preschool years, the more successful they are likely to be.Students often ask, “But when would I use this in real life?” Children don't want to put effort into learning things that aren't useful to them. Math is used every day in the real world. Grocery shopping, baking, measuring, counting, and building are all activities you can do with your child to show how we use math in the real world.For example, at the grocery store, you can ask your child to calculate the price of three boxes of cereal. While driving, you can ask how long it will take to reach your destination based on mileage and speed. At a toy store, ask how long it will take for your child to save enough allowance to buy a particular toy.

, Start the day with a morning math problem over breakfast. You can also end the day with math. Many families have bedtime stories, which promote a love of literacy. You can also have bedtime math to foster a love of math. Children who have bedtime math discussions with their parents can improve their math skills at school.It is never too early to discuss math with your child. Even preschoolers can have a discussion about math, such as finding patterns or comparing quantities. You might ask, “Do you have more blue stuffed animals, or yellow stuffed animals? How do you know?” Explore your school's math standards so that you know what topics are appropriate to discuss with your child.
There are a number of engaging picture books that directly address math topics.Dr. Seuss has a few books, such as One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish, that include math topics. Other Dr. Seuss books can easily inspire math activities. Many Eric Carle books, such as The Grouchy Ladybug, lend themselves to math discussions.While you read, pause to ask your child questions about what is happening in the story, and the math behind what is happening.

Create a chart.,
Start small.,
Try grouping numbers in telephone sequences.,
Add details to coordinate the list.This is how pros can not only memorize the digits in order, but pull out particular groups of numbers at will.,
Keep your groups on note cards.",How to Memorize Pi1," Write out pi to however many digits you hope to memorize. After you've written it out, group the digits in even numbers by penciling in parentheses around them.


Start with groups that have four digits in each one them : (3.141)(5926)(5358)(9793)(2384)(6264)(3383), etc.;
, The easiest way to memorize anything is by starting with a small group and working your way up. Like with weightlifting or sprints, you've got sets and repetitions, and you don't want to overwork yourself by trying to jam 100 digits into your brain all at once.


Start by memorizing four groups of four digits each. You can work your way up to ten groups of four digits each, one at a time, slowly. Then double your recitations to five groups of eight digits each. It'll be exactly the same number of digits, but you'll be able to up your memorization by adding larger ""sets.""

, Most memorization techniques or ""mnemonics"" operate under the principle that it's easier to memorize other things, like telephone numbers, than a complex series of digits. If you work up to grouping pi in groups of ten digits, you can organize the numbers into telephone number sequences that are more easy to memorize: Aaron (314)159-2653, Beth (589)793-2384, Carlos (626)433-8327, etc.


Giving them alphabetical names ensures that when you've memorized the first 260, you can start over and complete a whole ""phone book.""

, Try using names with the number of letters that correspond to the first digit in the sequence: Amy (314)159-2653.


Also try using real names and associating real things with the name on the list, or even fake things about each person. The closer you can link the numbers to the list of names in your mind, the easier it will be to remember the numbers.
You can also combine this technique with the major system and linking techniques discussed below.

, Carry the cards around with you as you go about your day, working on your recitation. When you can comfortably recite each group, continue adding another until you've reached your goal.

Write out sentences in ""pilish."",
Write poems in pilish.,
Rhyme to memorize.,
Try learning the major system.",How to Memorize Pi2," In pilish, where the number of letters in each word stands for the corresponding number in pi. For example, ""May I have a large container of coffee beans"" = 314159265 in pilish. In 1996, Mike Keith wrote a short story called ""Cadaeic Cadenza"" in which some 3800 digits of pi were encoded.Keith also developed a method of using words longer than 10 letters to represent sequences of numbers.

, A piem is a poem that encodes pi in its words, using the pilish method. Typically, they rhyme for the purposes of memorization and have titles of three letters, representing the 3 that begins pi.


A piem: Now I will a rhyme construct, / By letter count, the young instruct. / Cunningly devised endeavors, / Con it and remember ever. / Widths in circle here you see, / Sketched out in strange obscurity.


, Many schoolyard mnemonics have developed over the years to help memorize the first several digits of pi: Cosine, secant, tangent, sine / Three point one four one five nine. This mnemonic relies on using the rhythm and pattern to recall the memorized numbers.


Lots of other memorization songs use the same technique: ""If numbers had a heaven / their God would surely be / 3.14159 / 26535.""
The ABC tune, aka ""Baa-Baa Black Sheep,"" aka ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"": 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 / 6 5 3 5 8 9 / 7 9 3 2 3 8 4 / 6 2 6 4 3 3 8 / 3 2 7 9 5 0 2 / 8 8 4 1 9 7 1
Try writing your own song or rhyme to help yourself remember..

, Derivatives of the major system are used by some of the best mnemonists in the world. This extraordinarily complex technique involves substituting each digit or group of digits for a corresponding word that is phonetically similar, and eventually building a story or a series of linkages out of those words.

Try to divide the possible prime by the prime numbers less than the square root of that number.

,
With a confident sneer, proclaim whether or not it's prime and what it is divisible by!",How to Mentally Calculate Primality of Any Three Digit Number," Like any mathematical principle, you will remember it better if you practice on paper at the same time.;
, This will make your check faster since one only needs to try to divide the possible prime by the prime numbers less than the square root of that number. A quick reference might help: The square root of 100 is 10, of 225 is 15, of 400 is 20, of 625 is 25, and of 900 is 30.

, Since the square root of 1000 is about 33, you will never need to test any number higher than 31. By narrowing the number of tests down to 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31, you've already won half the battle.


Here are the divisibility rules for those prime numbers:


Divisible by 2 - If the number ends in 2, 4, 6, or 8

Divisible by 3 - If the digits added together are divisible by 3

Divisible by 5 - If the number ends in 0 or 5

Divisible by 7 - Take the last digit and multiply it by two. Subtract that number from the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 7 if that new number is divisible by 7.

Divisible by 11 - Take the last digit. Subtract that number from the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 11 if that new number is divisible by 11.

Divisible by 13 - Take the last digit and multiply it by four. Add that number to the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 13 if that new number is divisible by 13.

Divisible by 17 - Take the last digit and multiply it by five. Subtract that number from the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 17 if that new number is divisible by 17. (This sounds harder than it looks. An example below will illustrate.)

Divisible by 19 - Take the last digit and multiply it by two. Add that number to the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 19 if that new number is divisible by 19.

Divisible by 23 - Take the last digit and multiply it by seven. Add that number to the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 23 if that new number is divisible by 23.

Divisible by 29 - Take the last digit and multiply it by three. Add that number to the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 29 if that new number is divisible by 29.

Divisible by 31 - Take the last digit and multiply it by three. Subtract that number from the rest of the digits. The original number is divisible by 31 if that new number is divisible by 31.

Example Let's do 781.


Pencil and paper. Check.

Estimate the square root. 787 is between 625 and 900, so from the chart above, I know that 787's square root will be between 25 and 30, probably about 27. So, the primes I'll need to test for are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. The next prime is 29, and my mental math tells me that the square root of 787 probably isn't 29 since it's not super-close to 900.

Check for divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.


By two: 781 doesn't end in 2, 4, 6, or 8. So far so good.

By three: Add the digits; 7 + 8 + 1 = 16. 16 isn't divisible by 3, so neither is 781.

By five: 781 doesn't end in 0 or 5. Still prime.

By seven: Multiply the last digit by two; 1 * 2 = 2. Subtract it from the remaining digits; 78 - 2 = 76. 76 isn't divisible by 7 (remember that 70 is and 77 is), so neither is 781.

By eleven: Subtract the last digit from the remaining digits; 78 - 1 = 77. 77 is divisible by 11, so 781 is also.
So, 781 isn't prime. It is at least divisible by 11.





Example #2. Let's do 527.


Pencil and paper. Check.

Estimate the square root. 527 is between 400 and 625. So, looking at my chart, the square root of 527 is probably about 23. So, the primes I'll need to test are 2 through 23, again.

Check for divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.


By two: 527 doesn't end in 2, 4, 6, or 8. So far so good.

By three: Add the digits; 5 + 2 + 7 = 14. 14 isn't divisible by 3, so neither is 527.

By five: 527 doesn't end in 0 or 5. Moving on.

By seven: Multiply the last digit by two; 2 * 7 = 14. Subtract it from the remaining digits; 52 - 14 = 38. 38 isn't divisible by 7, so neither is 527.

By eleven: Subtract the last digit from the remaining digits; 52 - 7 = 45. 45 isn't divisible by 11, so neither is 527.

By thirteen: Multiply the last digit by four; 7 * 4 = 28. Add it too the remaining digits; 52 + 28 = 80. 80 isn't divisible by 13, so neither is 527.

By seventeen: Multiply the last digit by five; 7 * 5 = 35. Subtract it from the remaining digits; 52 - 35 = 17. 17 is divisible by 17, so 527 is too.
So, 527 isn't prime. It is at least divisible by 17.

Look at the unmarked lines on a metric ruler.The numbered lines represent centimeters, but the unmarked lines represent millimeters.,
Place the “0” end of the ruler at the starting edge.,
Read the numbered mark immediately before the ending edge.,
Count the unnumbered lines after the last numbered mark.Count the number of millimeter marks in between the last numbered mark you just identified and the actual ending point of the object being measured.

,
Add the two values together to calculate the length in millimeters.",How to Measure Mm1,"


If a metric ruler is too small, you could also use a meter stick. The small, unnumbered lines on a meter stick that fall in between the numbered lines should still be millimeters.
Note that each 1 cm also equals 10 mm.;
, Position the ruler so that its “0” edge is evenly lined up and parallel to the starting point of the edge or line you want to measure.


The ruler might not have a ""0"" marked on it. If this is the case, know that the ""0"" edge is simply the edge that comes directly before the marked ""1"" on the ruler.

, Find the point at which the edge or line you are measuring ends. Locate the numbered centimeter mark just before it, then multiply that centimeter number by 10 to determine how many millimeters it equals.


Make sure that the ruler is straight and flat against the line you are measuring.
If the edge ends on a marked number line, you can multiply that value by 10 and get your final answer.


Example: The length of a line measures from the 0 edge to the 2 mark, so that line is 20 (2 * 10) mm long.



,, The sum of your converted centimeter value and your extra millimeter value will equal the total number of millimeters in length for your measured edge or line.



Example: A line extends from the 0 mark to the fifth line past the 7 mark, so its length is 75 mm.

7 * 10 = 70
70 + 5 = 75

Find an item roughly 1 millimeter long.,
Place the object to be measured on a blank sheet of paper.,
Mark the starting edge.,
Place your measuring item at the starting edge.,
Move the measuring item down the full length.,
Count the gaps.",How to Measure Mm2," The simplest item to use would be a plastic identification card, license, credit card, or library card. These plastic cards are usually about 1 mm thick from front to back.A plastic card is probably the easiest item to use. Other items that are approximately 1 millimeter in length or width tend to be more difficult to work with, but may include a grain of salt or sand, 10 sheets of notebook paper stapled together, the thickness of one sheet of heavy printer paper, the thickness of a fingernail, the thickness of a grain or rice, and the thickness of a U.S. dime.

, Lay the edge or line you plan on measuring down on a sheet of white or light colored paper. Try to keep the entire edge on the paper.


If desired, you can use a pencil to trace along the outside of the edge. This allows you to remove the object being measured and work only with a flat line, which can make measuring such small lengths easier. Doing so is only optional, however.
The paper needs to be light in color. If it isn't, you might have difficulty seeing your marks.

, Use a pencil to carefully mark a perpendicular line off one side of the edge you are measuring. This will become your starting edge.

, Place the narrow 1-mm edge of your plastic card down on the paper, placing it directly next to your starting edge line. Draw another small mark with your pencil on the opposite side of the card.


Keep the mark as close to the outer edge of your card as possible.
Note that you can use this procedure for any other estimation tool. It is not exclusive to plastic identification cards.

, Shift the card so that it lies to the outside of your newly created mark, then draw another mark on the opposite side of the card again. Continue moving the card down the line in small increments like this, marking each one, until you reach the very end of the edge you are measuring.


Keep the card perpendicular to the line being measured the entire time you measure out the marks.
Make sure that the ending edge of the line is also marked.

, Remove the edge being measured and the card you are using the measure it. Count the gaps in between each line you marked. The number of gaps will give you your estimated number of millimeters.


Only count the gaps. Do not count the lines, since there will be one too many.

Convert centimeters to millimeters.,
Calculate the number of millimeters from the number of meters.,
Determine the number of millimeters when you have kilometers.",How to Measure Mm3," There are 10 millimeters for every 1 centimeter.


When you know the length of an object in centimeters but need to know the length in millimeters, multiply the number of centimeters by 10.

Example: 2.4 cm * 10 = 24 mm

, For each meter, there are 1000 millimeters.


If you need to know the length of something in millimeters but you are given the measurement in meters, multiply the number of meters by 1000 to find the equivalent number of millimeters.

Example: 5.13 m * 1000 = 5130 mm

, There are 1,000,000 millimeters in every 1 kilometer (0.62 mi).


To change a length measurement recorded in kilometers to one recorded in millimeters, you must multiply the kilometer value by 1,000,000.

Example: 1.4 kilometers (0.87 mi) * 1000000 = 1,400,000 mm

"
Convert inches to millimeters.,
Determine the number of millimeters from the number of feet.,
Calculate millimeters from yards.",How to Measure Mm4," If you are given a measurement in inches, you can convert that measurement into millimeters by dividing it by a conversion factor of: 0.039370There are 25.4 mm in 1 inch. This is not a constant ratio, however, which is why you need to use a conversion factor rather than adding 25.4 mm for every inch.

Example: 9.3 inches / 0.039370 = 236.22 mm

, To find an equal millimeter value when you know the length of something in feet, you must divide the number of feet by a conversion factor of: 0.0032808Example: 4.7 feet (1.4 m) / 0.0032808 = 1432.58 mm

, When you are given a measurement in yards but need to convert it into millimeters, you can do so by dividing the number of yards by a conversion factor of: 0.0010936Example: 0.03 yards (0.0 m) / 0.0010936 = 27.43 mm

Define the surface for testing.,
Define the datum.,
Ensure that the datum is level and clean.,
Define the tolerance range.,
Ensure a consistent temperature.",How to Measure Parallelism1," Parallelism is a quality that can be tested on several different types of surfaces. These are labeled based on their positions relative to each other. You may wish to test parallelism of the following:Planar surface: Opposite flat surfaces of a rectangular solid need to be parallel to each other.
Cylindrical surface: A cylinder appears round when looking at its end, but when held upright, its sides must be parallel for the cylinder to function properly. Parallelism also needs to be measured on the interior cylindrical surfaces of drilled holes.;
, The datum is a flat surface that you use as a reference. This will be one edge or corner of the object being tested. Measurements for the size and shape of the object are then drawn in reference to the datum.In technical drawing, the datum is marked with a capital letter in a square box called the datum feature symbol. All other surfaces of the tested item that are parallel to that surface are marked with the same letter for reference.
In machining parts, it is common to define three datum surfaces, for reference in all three dimensions of the solid object. These will be labeled A, B and C., Your measurements will be flawed if foreign objects are allowed to interfere. On a large scale, something like sand or other visible objects on the datum will prevent the tested surface from sitting flat. The parallelism will therefore be measured incorrectly. Depending on the level of precision that you need, something as minuscule as dust on the surface may throw off the measurements.


The level of precision that you need in measuring the parallelism will factor into just how clean the datum must be.

, No two surfaces are exactly parallel to each other. You must define the level of precision you require and the level of precision that you can measure. If the two surfaces fall within that tolerance range, you then can say that they are parallel.For example, you might require two surfaces to be parallel to within a quarter inch. This means that the measurement at one end of the surface may be a quarter inch or less from the measurement at the other end of the surface, for the surfaces to be called parallel. If the difference is more than one quarter inch, then it fails parallelism.

, If your measurement requires a very high level of precision, then slight variations in temperature may affect the parallelism of the surface. Some materials expand or contract as the temperature changes. Very precise measuring instruments will recommend that you calibrate the temperature of the room and the object being measured, and allow adequate time for them to reach a consistent temperature.

Orient the tested part on the surface plate.,
Take the measurement of the opposing sides.,
Use technical equipment for more precise measurements.,
Determine whether parallelism exists.",How to Measure Parallelism2," Whether you are measuring parallelism with a simple ruler or with a precise technical instrument, the procedure is essentially the same. Align the datum of the tested object onto the surface plate of the measuring equipment.For example, a standard gage comparator will have a flat base. This will serve as the surface plate. Set your object on this base to begin the measurement.

, Determining parallelism means finding that two opposing sides of an object, which are supposed to be parallel, are consistently far apart at all positions. To test this, you need to measure the distance between the two surfaces at multiple positions. If the distance is within the specified tolerance, then the sides are deemed to be parallel.For low precision, low-tech measurements, you can use a simple ruler. Measure the distance from the datum to the opposite surface of the object at multiple points and compare these measurements.

, A child building a bird house may be satisfied if the two walls of the bird house are parallel to within a fairly wide tolerance level. However, for machining precise equipment, medical tools or computer components, for example, you are likely to require must more precise measurements and much smaller tolerance levels. Special equipment exists for measuring parallelism for such objects.


For more high quality testing, precise instruments exist that can measure to within a millionth of an inch. Some of these operate with a dial indicator arm that you pass over the tested surface. As you pass the dial indicator arm over the surface of the object, it will register any variations.
At the highest level of precision, optical interference technology can measure parallelism extremely precisely. A special kind of glass lens is placed on the flat surface whose parallelism is to be tested. A laser light with known frequency is then passed through the lens. If the surface is precisely parallel, the laser passes through with a predictable wavelength pattern. If the surface is not parallel, the wavelength pattern is disrupted., Refer to your initial decisions about tolerance and precision and the specifications for the size of the part in question. Review the results of your measurements and determine whether the measurements fall within the tolerance range.For example, if a particular part is supposed to be 3 cm. thick, with a parallelism tolerance of 0.02 cm., you need to review the measurements that you collected. Acceptable measurements will fall between 2.98 and 3.02 cm. If you find measurements outside this range, you need to conclude that the surfaces are not parallel."

SINGLY EVEN ORDER - 6X6 SQUARE.,
Now let us have a look at 6x6 squares.,
We will now first complete the diagonals by inserting 1 and 36, in one and 2 and 35, in the other.,
The completed 6x6 square would be as shown below:


11 16 34 03 21 26
25 22 10 27 15 12

18 13 33 04 24 19
20 23 31 06 14 17

,


,
We have 880 squares to choose from, further for placing 3,4,6 & 10 we have 24 choices.,


,
Of course there are other methods of working out the 6x6 squares to give us many more 6x6 squares.,
A 10x10 order square will have numbers from 1 to 100 with a total of 505.,
We have the choice to place numbers from 1 to 8 as we please.,
For the 14x14 square we can follow the same procedure by starting with a 10x10 square in which 196-100 = 96, 96/2= 48, has been added to all numbers to give a total of 985.",How to Make Multiple of Singly Even Magic Squares by a Simple Method,";
, 6x6 square will have numbers from 1 to 36, while 4x4 square had numbers from 1 to 16. 36-16=20/2=10. Let us add 10 to all numbers of any 4x4 square to get a 4x4 square with a total of 74. This 4x4 square we will place as 2x2 squares in the 4 corners in the left hand side 6x6 square. We now have numbers fro 1to 10 and 27 to 36 to fill the empty places.


11 16 xx xx 21 26 'xx' is about places yet to be filled.
25 22 xx xx 15 12
xx xx xx xx xx xx

, The rest of the numbers are so filled that we have total of 37 in the rest of the 2 places in rows and columns with total of 111 in each of the 3rd and 4th columns and rows.

,,, This is because we have 4 choices for placing the first number, 3 choices for placing the next number and 2 choices for the next number. Similarly for placing 5,7,8, & 9 we have 24 choices, so we easily get 880x24x24 all different squares. Further for the diagonals we have option of choosing the numbers. Instead of 1 and 2 we could have chosen 9 and 10. One combination available would be 1,9,10, for one column and 5,7,8 for the other, and 3,4,10 for one row and 2,6,9 for the other row. Work out other combinations and each one will give rise to 880x24x24 new 6x6 squares?

,, We could have placed the 4x4 square with total of 74, as a center square and filled up the numbers from 1 to 10 and 27 to 36 in the empty places in the squares in the 1st 2nd, 5th and 6th columns and 1st 2nd, 5th and 6th rows. There are other methods also, try putting the 4x4 square with total of 74 in the 1st to 4th rows and columns and filling up the 5th and 6th columns and rows with the available numbers? Try other ways also.

, 6x6 order square had numbers from 1 to 36. 100-36 = 64, 64/2 is 32. So we add 32 to all numbers in the 6x6 order square to get one with a total of 303. This will be placed in the center and empty spaces will be filled first by three 4x4 squares, one square will have numbers from 9 to 16 and 85 to 92, 2nd from 17 to 24 and 77 to 84 and the 3rd from 25 to 32 and 69 to 76. Now there will be 16 spaces to be filled, 8 in columns 5, 6, and rows 1, 2, 9 & 10, and 8 in rows 5, 6 and columns 1, 2, 9 & 10. We have to ensure that the set of numbers are such that in the 1st case rows total 101 and in the 2nd case columns total 101, along with ensuring that column total is 202 in 1st and row total is 202 in the 2nd case. If we select the smaller numbers with equal totals in the columns and rows respectively, we will get the right totals. It is for this reason that 1 & 4, 2 & 3, 5 & 8 and 6 & 7 have been selected.


92 82 77 01 100 24 19 09 11
10 20 18 04 097 81 83 89 91
75 43 48 66 035 53 58 28 73
30 57 54 42 059 47 44 71 25

15 21 23 99 002 80 78 88 86
85 79 84 98 003 17 22 16 14

, So the number of 6x6 squares can be multiplied by 8x6x4x2 to get the number of squares for the 10x10 square. Of course there are other ways to construct the 10x10 squares so the number of possible squares can only be imagined., Total required is 14(1+196)/2= 1379. We will have to insert seven 4x4 squares with a total of 394 and fill up the remaining 16 spaces with numbers from 1 to 8 and 189 to 196. We can place the numbers from 1 to 8 as we did in the 10x10 square. Similarly we can go from 14x14 square to the 18x18 square and so on."

Rulers are stiff, straight edges with graduated markings.Typically, one side has markings for inches and the other side has markings for centimeters. These tools are good to use for relatively short lengths.

Tape measures are flexible straight edges with graduated markings. Since most tape measures only measure one unit system (U.S. customary or metric), you'll need to find one that uses the unit system you need. Since these tools can bend, they're good to use when measuring the total length of an object that exists in more than one dimension (e.g., waist measurements, the circumference of a wood block, etc.).
Meter sticks and yard sticks are similar in construction and length. Both are stiff straight edges with graduated markings. Meter sticks measure all lengths up to 1 meter (or 100 cm), and yard sticks measure all lengths up to 1 yard (or 3 feet).
Odometers are tools that measure long lengths traveled by vehicles, like cars and bicycles. Pedometers measure long lengths traveled by a human or other living creature as it walks. These tools are good for measuring miles and kilometers, but they are calibrated by professionals and work without hands-on involvement from the user.;
, Find the zero (0) mark on one end of the measuring stick or measuring tape. Align this zero mark with the starting edge of the object to be measured.


Note that the zero mark is not always located at the exact starting edge of the measuring tool. Look for the long line standing just above the labeled 0—that line is the zero mark.

, Lay the measuring stick or measuring tape flat over the surface of the object. Keep the entire tool perpendicular to the starting edge.


Continue to extend the measuring tool over the entire length until you reach the other edge of the intended length.

, Go to the ending edge of the object to be measured and look for the largest whole number that shows just before that ending edge. Write down that whole number.


Make sure that you write down the unit of measurement along with the whole number.
When the edge lands between two whole numbers, use the lesser of the two values.

For instance, if the edge of a measured length falls between 5 inches and 6 inches, use 5 inches for your measurement.



, Count the total number of lines in between whole number sets, then count the exact number of lines existing between the largest whole number and the ending edge of the object to be measured. Mark these numbers down.


The number of lines between whole number sets should be consistent for the entire tool. When using the metric system, there will usually be 9 lines (10 spaces) between whole numbers. When using the U.S. standard system, there will usually be 3 lines (4 spaces), 7 lines (8 spaces), or 15 lines (16 spaces).
Count the number of lines exactly. If the edge falls between two lines, round up or down based on which line the edge lies closest to.

For instance, if there are 7 lines (8 spaces) between sets on the ruler and your edge lands closer to the third line than the second line, use the third line. This would give you 3/8 inch (use the number of spaces for the denominator, not the number of lines).



, Add the number of lines, as a fraction, to the largest whole number. The sum of these two numbers should be the length of the object.


Following the previous example: 5 inches + 3/8 inches = 5-3/8 inches

, Since it's easy to make mistakes when taking length measurements, it's usually a good idea to take the measurement again by following through the same steps. Compare the results when finished.


If the results differ from your first measurement, continue re-measuring until you find two matching measurements.

, The inch is the smallest unit of length you'll likely see when working within the U.S. standard.


An inch is roughly the same length as the last joint of an average adult finger. This is only an estimate, though, and not an accurate way to measure inches., The foot is the second smallest unit you'll probably need, and 1 foot equals 12 inches.


As its name suggests, the foot was originally named since it roughly matched the length of an adult male's foot. Since human feet vary so much in length, though, you cannot accurately measure U.S. standard feet using your own foot.

, Yards are slightly larger than feet. To be more precise, 1 yard equals 3 feet.


This also means that there are 36 inches in 1 yard.
As an estimate, one yard is roughly the same length as the height of a standard acoustic guitar.

, Miles are one of the largest units you'll see within this measuring system. There are 1,760 yards in 1 mile.


This means that there are also 5,280 feet in 1 mile. Similarly, there are 63,360 inches in one mile.

, The meter is the basis of all length measurements within the metric system.


One meter is roughly the same length as the height of a guitar. This is only an estimate, though, and not a reliable way to measure meters., Each smaller length unit gets smaller by a factor of 10. The ones you'll need to use most often are the decimeter, centimeter, and millimeter.


In 1 meter, there are:

10 decimeters
100 centimeters
1000 millimeters



, Each larger length unit gets larger by a factor of 10. The ones you'll need to use most often are likely the decameter, hectometer, and kilometer.


There are:

10 meters in 1 decameter
100 meters in 1 hectometer
1000 meters in 1 kilometer



, Since U.S. standard units and metric units do not follow the same scale, you'll need to know the mathematical relationship between the unit you have and the unit you need when converting one to the other.


A few standard to metric conversions worth memorizing include:1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
1 inch = 25.4 millimeters
1 foot = 30.48 centimeters
1 yd = 0.91 meters
1 mile = 1.6 kilometers


A few metric to standard conversions worth memorizing include:

1 millimeter = 0.04 inches
1 centimeter = 0.39 inches
1 centimeter = 0.0325 feet
1 meter = 3.28 feet
1 meter = 1.09 yards
1 kilometer = 0.62 miles



, When you know how many of the intended unit exists for one of your original units, you can multiply the original value by the conversion factor.



Example 1: Convert 5.4 inches to centimeters.

There are 2.54 centimeters in 1 inch, so:
5.4 * 2.54 = 13.72 centimeters



Example 2: Convert 13.72 centimeters to inches.

There are 0.39 inches in 1 centimeter, so:
13.72 * 0.39 = 5.4 inches



, If you only know how many of the original unit exists for one of the intended unit, you'll need to divide the original value by the conversion factor.



Example 1: Convert 5.4 inches to centimeters.

There are 0.39 inches in 1 centimeter, so:
5.4 / 0.39 = 13.8 centimeters



Example 2: Convert 13.8 centimeters to inches.

There are 2.54 centimeters in 1 inch, so:
13.8 / 2.54 = 5.4 inches

Treat math like reading.,
Talk about math out loud.,
Get building toys for your kids.,
Enjoy family game time with math.,
Have fun with music.",How to Make Math Easy1," Parents often read with their kids to get them reading, but fewer do math every day with their kids. Start with counting and number recognition. For instance, count how many strawberries are on the plate, how many signs are on the road, how many tires are on the car, and so on. Doing so will encourage your child to start understanding numbers.As your child starts understanding numbers, help them notice them when you're out and about. For instance, point out signs with numbers on them or help them notice numbers on menus.
Games like hopscotch also help with number recognition.Shapes are also important when it comes to getting your child started on math. Point out shapes in the world, as well as with the toys they play with. For instance, you could say, ""Look at that sign! It's a rectangle. And that one is a triangle!"";
, You likely use math everyday, whether it's to calculate how much gas you can afford or how much meat you'll need for dinner. Instead of doing this math in your head, say it aloud. Your kids may not understand it all at first, but the exposure will help them be better mathematicians., Building toys help your kid understand spatial math. Building toys can be ones with pipes and joints, interlocking blocks, or even interlocking logs. They also help your child understand how parts form a whole. It can also help to model the behavior by building with your kid., Many board games for younger kids are designed to help them learn math. For instance, any game that requires your kid to count spaces helps with math, such as Chutes and Ladders or Candyland. Hi-Ho! Cherry-O is also a good option., It's been proven that there's a connection between learning and playing music and being better in math. Plus, playing an instrument can be fun. Your kid will need to learn to count, as well as learn to think abstractly."

Determine what you want to know.,
Determine what you already know.,
Determine the physical principles that govern the model you want to create.,
Identify the equations that you will need to use to find your answer.,
Look at what others have done.,
Create a diagram for your model.,
Create your model.,
Test your model.,
Determine how the model could be improved.",How to Make a Mathematical Model," What is the objective of creating a model? Make a list of the data you want to find by using the model. It is crucial to ask this question before you create your model or you may end up creating a model that does not meet your objective.Do you want to predict something? Find out how to regulate something? Or do something else?For example, imagine you want to know how much room you have in a storage unit to see how many boxes you can put into it. You will be creating a model to predict the amount of space that is in your storage unit.;
, What data do you already have? Make a list of the data that has been given. As you list the data, decide what pieces are most relevant and which pieces are not relevant.You should also list any information that can be assumed based on what you already know.
Keep in mind that you may have to take measurements to find the data that you need.
To find out how much room you have in your storage unit, you will need to measure the unit's height, width, and length.

, Do you need to consider factors like gravity, volume, time, etc.? Make a note of any factors that will need to be considered when you create the model.To determine the amount of space that you have in your storage unit, you will need to find the volume.
You also need to keep in mind that there will be some wasted space, since some objects may be irregular and that will make it difficult to use every inch of the storage unit., What equations and formulas will you need in order to find your answer? How will you apply these equations and formulas? Make sure that you have a clear understanding of how to plug the data that you have into the equation.


To find the volume of the storage unit, you will need to use the equation V= h x w x l, There is no need to re-invent the wheel if somebody else has developed a model that may suit your purposes already. Check in your textbook or ask your teacher. Just remember to make sure that someone else’s model will work for your situation.


To get an idea of how to find the volume using the equation you have identified, check your textbook or ask your teacher.

, A simple mathematical model may not require a diagram. However, if you are creating a complex model, a diagram may help you determine if your model will work. Draw a diagram to represent the actual model you plan to make.


Make sure to incorporate your data into your diagram to help guide you when you create the actual model.

, Once you have finished the planning phase, you should be able to create your model. Use your diagram, data, and other information to make your mathematical model. Make sure to check your notes often to ensure accuracy.


Make sure that your model represents the actual relationship among your data that you are trying to accomplish.
For more advanced models, you may need to use a computer program.

, It is important to verify the validity of your model’s results before you try to do anything else with your model. Apply your data and see if the model is valid. Are your results what you expected? Do they make sense? Are the results repeatable?


Solve the equation V = h x w x l to determine if your results make sense. Repeat the solution to determine if your results are repeatable.

, In order to make your model useful for further applications, you need to consider how it could be improved. Are there any variables that you should have considered? Are there any restrictions that could be lifted? Try to find the best way to improve upon your model before you use it again.For example, if you want to have 3 feet (0.91 m) of space to walk through your storage unit, you could adjust your equation to account for that space. Just deduct the space you will lose from the appropriate number in your equation. In this case, you could adjust your equation to read V = h x (w-3) x lAfter you have identified ways to improve your model, make the changes and test it again.

Encourage a positive attitude.,
Connect math to the real world.,
Have a family game night.,
Give them some screen time.,
Work on abstract concepts.",How to Make Math Easy2," You may be inclined to say things like, ""Well, I wasn't very good at math, either."" However, it's better to encourage them to step up to the plate, so to speak. You could say, ""Math may seem hard now, but if you work at it, you're going to get so much better!"", Some teachers don't do a great job of showing kids how math is useful. Just like with younger kids, you can talk about how you're using math in you're everyday life, then challenge them to solve the problem in your place. For instance, if you're at the grocery store, have them figure out which is the better deal on a bottle of ketchup., Like younger kids, playing board games with older kids can help develop math skills in a low-stress environment. For older kids, try games like Monopoly, Settlers of Catan, Sheriff of Nottingham, or even Ticket to Ride., Plenty of apps and even video games help develop math skills with older kids. You can try apps like Mathmeter, Wuzzit Trouble, or King of Math, available on most phones and tablets.Online video games, particularly ones that have currency and require puzzle-solving skills, can help older kids work on skills, too., Once kids get down the basics, you can start working on concepts instead. That way, kids need to actually put some thought into how to solve it. As they get older, you can increase the difficulty.For example, you could ask how long it will take you to get home, if you're traveling at a certain speed and going a certain distance.
You could also ask questions, such as ""How long will it take to add water to this pool?""

Establish your level.,
Level up.,
Work on understanding math.,
Try math apps.",How to Make Math Easy3," All math builds on other skills, so to make it easier on yourself, you need to figure out where you are now. You can find tests online that will help you establish what level you're at, so you know what you need to work on.For instance, you can try the UK's National Numeracy exam.

, Once you know what you need to work on, take advantage of online resources to work on your skills. In fact, many placement tests also have simple courses you can take (for free) to work on your skills and improve over time.Part of doing well at math is believing you can get better. Try to approach math with a positive attitude.
You can try the UK's National Numeracy courses, the BBC's Skill Wise, or a website like Khan Academy.

, Many adults were taught math by memorization as kids. For instance, maybe you just sat down and memorized the multiplication table for school. However, that doesn't help you understand how math works. When you understand how it works, it makes it easier to apply it to problems that you don't already have a formula for.For example, you likely know that 3 times 5 equals 15. However, if you've just memorized that fact, you may not have sat down to think about the why of it. Multiplication, though, is just a more advanced form of adding. This equation just means you have 3 groups of 5 (5 plus 5 plus 5 equals 15) or 5 groups of 3 (3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 equals 15)., Just like games are a good way for kids to learn math, they can also make it easier for you to learn. You can search for math apps or try something like King of Math to work on your math skills.You can also try video or online games that require puzzle-solving skills.

Find the interior numbers using the numbers above them.,
Look for patterns in the triangle.",How to Make a Pascal's Triangle,",, For every new line, you will have one more number than the previous one. Each outside number is a 1 every time.

, Each inside number can be found by adding the two numbers above it. For example, The middle number on the third line of Pascal's Triangle is 1+1=2.

, You will notice many interesting patterns that form as you build the layers of your triangle.


The one row consists of only ones. The following rows consist of the counting numbers, followed by the triangular numbers.The sum of the numbers in each row (with row number given) is about the answer of 2 to that number expressed as an exponent (uses base-2).Keeping in mind that the first number in any row is the 0th element 1, if you take the next number in that row and divide all the other elements in that row, you'll see that the items are evenly divisible by the row number expressed.
Each line of the Pascal's triangle, has a direct effect on being shown using a base number to the power of the row number, with a few exceptions. Some rows where the next box contains one or more numbers for the box, the tens place gets added to the box to the left of it.Look for the symmetrical pattern in the Triangle..

Let your friend review the proof again.",How to Make a False Proof Using Infinity1," If your friend doesn't know, help him or her figure it out for him-/herself. Don't give them the answer unless you really have to. If your friend can't get it, ask him or her a more visual version of the question, for example: ""If I had an infinite supply of apples and I add one more apple to the supply, how many apples are in my supply?"" The answer is infinity.;
, ∞ + 1 = ∞

, The formal name for this operation is called the subtractive property of equality. What you are left with is 1 = 0.

, He or she will want to look at it more closely and try to figure out what the flaw is. He or she will probably fail. You might feel inclined to laugh at your friend's bewilderment or make fun of him or her a little. This would be a good time to do so. The catch is that when you subtracted ∞ from both sides, your friend assumed that ∞ - ∞ = 0. Because ∞ is not a real number, it follows its own set of rules. Almost nobody knows this. ∞ - ∞ is indeterminate because some infinities are actually bigger than other infinities. In this case, the infinity on the right side of the equation is inherently bigger than the one on the left.

Familiarize, not memorize.,
Know exactly what you're expected to find.,
What do I need to come up with this result?,
What do I do next?,
Relate the problem to the real world.,
Discuss the problem.,
Review what you have.,
Don't forget to check obvious resources, such as your textbook, which often has examples of problems similar to the one you're trying to solve.,
Don't give up.",How to Love Solving Math Problems," If memorization hinders you from appreciating this subject, then stop doing it. If you memorized something, it doesn’t follow that you have fully grasped the concept. Mere memorization is different from truly understanding it. The latter works best because if we talk about terms and formulas, there is quite a lot in Math!;
, In grade school, this is the first step in problem-solving. “What is needed?” The objective is to answer this question.

, Look at all the given information and values. Analyze the relationships among all the values and variables given. (It might help to write down any equations that might be relevant, especially equations that connect the values you've been given.)

, After knowing the expected output and having given the necessary values, decide on which steps to take. This is where Tip No. 1 applies. If you're already familiar with the processes because you've understood them, then this step should be easier.

, Think of any activity in which you could apply the problem. It could be as simple as needing to buy something worth $20, but you've only got $15. Apparently, you would need another $5 to complete it.

, Talk to a classmate or to your friends, and ask for their opinion on what you've got so far. This will also develop a healthy and productive conversation in which all of you can benefit. One good thing about Math problem-solving is that there’s a lot of ways to express your opinion on the subject matter. You can choose a variety of ways to set out possible solutions.

, Analyze whether or not you have a logical solution to the problem. Ask yourself, “Did this answer the question I was given?” If your answer is ""yes,"" then you have solved the problem. Otherwise, go back and try again.

, A good text will not give you an example that is almost exactly the same; you will have to make some connections that are not obvious. Another source of inspiration can often be problems that are in the vicinity of the problem that you're working on, assuming that it comes from an exercise section in a book. (If it does not come from anywhere in your Math book, look around in other Math books, to see whether you can discover whether it happens to come from somewhere else, and look for examples and companion problems in that book. It might feel like cheating, but think of it as research.)

, If you failed at solving a question, don't stop there. Try practising more. Quitting is never an option.

Come to class on time. In fact, come a little early and open your notebook to the right place, open your textbook and take out your calculator so that you're ready to start when your teacher is ready to start.
Only skip class if you are sick. When you do miss class, talk to a classmate to find out what the teacher talked about and what homework was assigned.;
, If your teacher works problems at the front of your class, then work along with the teacher in your notebook.


Make sure that your notes are clear and easy to read. Don't just write down the problems. Also write down anything that the teacher says that increases your understanding of the concepts.
Work any sample problems that your teacher posts for you to do. When the teacher walks around the classroom as you work, answer questions.
Participate while the teacher is working a problem. Don't wait for your teacher to call on you. Volunteer to answer when you know the answer, and raise your hand to ask questions when you're unsure of what's being taught.

, When you do the homework the same day, the concepts are fresh on your mind. Sometimes, finishing your homework the same day isn't possible. Just make sure that your homework is complete before you go to class.

, Go to your teacher during his or her free period or during office hours.


If you have a Math Center at your school, then find out the hours that it's open and go get some help.
Join a study group. Good study groups usually contain 4 or 5 people at a good mix of ability levels. If you're a ""C"" student in math, then join a group that has 2 or 3 ""A"" or ""B"" students so that you can raise your level. Avoid joining a group full of students whose grades are lower than yours., In most schools, students work on arithmetic during the elementary grades. Arithmetic includes the fundamentals of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.


Work on drills. Doing a lot of arithmetic problems again and again is the best way to get the fundamentals down pat. Look for software that will give you lots of different math problems to work on. Also, look for timed drills to increase your speed.
Repetition is the basis of math. The concept has to be not only learned, but put to work for you to remember it!
You can also find arithmetic drills online, and you can download arithmetic apps onto your mobile device.

, This course will provide the building blocks that you'll need to solve algebra problems later on.


Learn about fractions and decimals. You'll learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide both fractions and decimals. Regarding fractions, you'll learn how to reduce fractions and interpret mixed numbers. Regarding decimals, you'll understand place value, and you'll be able to use decimals in word problems.
Study ratios, proportions and percentages. These concepts will help you to learn about making comparisons.
Solve squares and square roots. When you've mastered this topic, you'll have perfect squares of many numbers memorized. You'll also be able to work with equations containing square roots.
Introduce yourself to basic geometry. You'll learn all of the shapes as well as 3D concepts. You'll also learn concepts like area, perimeter, volume and surface area, as well as information about parallel and perpendicular lines and angles.
Understand some basic statistics. In pre-algebra, your introduction to statistics mostly includes visuals like graphs, scatter plots, stem-and-leaf plots and histograms.
Learn algebra basics. These will include concepts like solving simple equations containing variables, learning about properties like the distributive property, graphing simple equations and solving inequalities.

, In your first year of algebra, you will learn about the basic symbols involved in algebra. You'll also learn to:


Solve linear equations and inequalities that contain 1-2 variables. You'll learn how to solve these problems not only on paper, but sometimes on a calculator as well.
Tackle word problems. You'll be surprised how many everyday problems that you'll face in your future involve the ability to solve algebraic word problems. For example, you'll use algebra to figure out the interest rate that you earn on your bank account or on your investments. You can also use algebra to figure out how long you'll have to travel based on the speed of your car.
Work with exponents. When you start solving equations with polynomials (expressions containing both numbers and variables), you'll have to understand how to use exponents. This may also include working with scientific notation. Once you have exponents down, you can learn to add, subtract, multiply and divide polynomial expressions.
Understand functions and graphs. In algebra, you'll really get into graphic equations. You'll learn how to calculate the slope of a line, how to put equations into point-slope form, and how to calculate the x- and y-intercepts of a line using slope-intercept form.
Figure out systems of equations. Sometimes, you're given 2 separate equations with both x and y variables, and you have to solve for x or y for both equations. Fortunately, you'll learn many tricks for solving these equation including graphing, substitution and addition., In geometry, you'll learn about the properties of lines, segments, angles and shapes.You'll memorize a number of theorems and corollaries that will help you to understand the rules of geometry.
You'll learn how to calculate the area of a circle, how to use the Pythagorean theorem and how to figure out relationships between angles and sides of special triangles.
You'll see a lot of geometry on future standardized tests like the SAT, the ACT and the GRE.

, Algebra II builds on the concepts that you learned in Algebra I but adds more complex topics involving more complex non-linear functions and matrices.

, You know the words of trig: sine, cosine, tangent, etc. Trigonometry will teach you many practical ways to calculate angles and lengths of lines, and these skills will be invaluable for people who go into construction, architecture, engineering or surveying.

, Calculus may sound intimidating, but it's an amazing tool chest for understanding both the behavior of numbers and the world around you.


Calculus will teach you about functions and about limits. You'll see the behavior or a number of useful functions including e^x and logarithmic functions.
You'll also learn how to calculate and work with derivatives. A first derivative gives you information based on the slope of a tangent line to an equation. For instance, a derivative tells you the rate at which something is changing in a non-linear situation. A second derivative will tell you whether a function is increasing or decreasing along a certain interval so that you can determine the concavity of a function.
Integrals will teach you how to calculate the area beneath a curve as well as volume.
High school calculus usually ends with sequences and series. Although students won't see many applications for series, they are important to people who go on to study differential equations.
Calculus is still only the beginning for some. If you are considering a career with a high involvement of math and science, like an engineer, try going a bit farther!, Adding 1 to a number takes you to the next highest number on the number line. For example, 2 + 1 = 3.

, Any number added to zero equals the same number because ""zero"" is the same as ""nothing.""

, Doubles are problems that involve adding two of the same number. For example, 3 + 3 = 6 is an example of an equation involving doubles.

, In the example below, you learn through mapping what happens when you add 3 to 5, 2 and 1. Try the ""add 2"" problems on your own.

, Learn to add 3 numbers together to get a number larger than 10.

, Learn about regrouping 1s into the 10s place, 10s into the 100s place, etc.


Add the numbers in the right column first. 8 + 4 = 12, which means you have 1 10 and 2 1s. Write down the 2 under the 1s column.
Write the 1 over the 10s column.
Add the 10s column together.

, Subtracting 1 from a number takes you backwards 1 number. For example, 4 - 1 = 3.

, For instance, you add the doubles 5 + 5 to get 10. Just write the equation backward to get 10 - 5 = 5.


If 5 + 5 = 10, then 10 - 5 = 5.
If 2 + 2 = 4, then 4 - 2 = 2.

, For example:


3 + 1 = 4
1 + 3 = 4
4 - 1 = 3
4 - 3 = 1

, For example, ___ + 1 = 6 (the answer is 5). This also sets the foundation for algebra and beyond.

,, Subtract the numbers in the 1s column and bring down the number in the 10s column.

,


32 = 3 10s and 2 1s.
64 = 6 10s and 4 1s.
96 = __ 10s and __ 1s.

You want to subtract 42 - 37. You start by trying to subtract 2 - 7 in the 1s column. However, that doesn't work!
Borrow 10 from the 10s column and put it into the 1s column. Instead of 4 10s, you now have 3 10s. Instead of 2 1s, you now have 12 1s.
Subtract your 1s column first: 12 - 7 = 5. Then, check the 10s column. Since 3 - 3 = 0, you don't have to write 0. Your answer is 5., Any number times 1 is equal to itself. Any number times zero equals zero.

You want to multiply 34 x 6. You start by multiplying the 1s column (4 x 6), but you can't have 24 1s in the 1s column.
Keep 4 1s in the 1s column. Move the 2 10s over to the 10s column.
Multiply 6 x 3, which equals 18. Add the 2 that you carried over, which will equal 20.

, If 4 x 4 = 16, then 16 / 4 = 4.

,


Divide the number to the left of the division symbol, or the divisor, into the first number under the division symbol. Since 6 / 2 = 3, you'll write 3 on top of the division symbol.
Multiply the number on top of the division symbol by the divisor. Bring the product down under the first number under the division symbol. Since 3 x 2 = 6, then you'll bring a 6 down.
Subtract the 2 numbers that you've written. 6 - 6 = 0. You can leave the 0 blank also, since you don't usually start a new number with 0.
Bring the second number that is under the division symbol down.
Divide the number that you brought down by the divisor. In this case, 8 / 2 = 4. Write 4 on top of the division symbol.
Multiply the top right number by the divisor and bring the number down. 4 x 2 = 8.
Subtract the numbers. The final subtraction equals zero, which means that you have finished the problem. 68 / 2 = 34., Some divisors won't divide evenly into other numbers. When you've finished your final subtraction, and you have no more numbers to bring down, then the final number is your remainder."

, When you place the same symbols together, you can just add their values. Normally the maximum number of the consecutive same symbols is three.


II = 2
XXX = 30

, Similar to the above rule, just add their values together. Remember the numeral must have the larger symbol value first for this to work. Here's how you do it:


XI = 11
MCL = 1150

, In this case, you need to subtract the smaller value from the larger value. Here's how you do it:


IV = 4
CM = 900

, There are numerous rules that govern the way Roman numerals are supposed to look. Here are some rules to know:


IV should be used rather than IIII
2987 is written as MMCMLXXXVII because:

The first M gives you 1000
The next M gives you 1000
The next CM gives you 900
The next LXXX gives you 80
The next VII gives you 7
Therefore if you add the amounts together, you will get 2987.



, Since M = 1,000, if you want to represent one million, a bar, or line, is added above the numeral M, equaling one million. The bar above the numeral represents that figure times one thousand. Thus, M x M= 1,000,000.


Five million would be represented by MMMMM with a bar above each M. This procedure is necessary because in Roman numerals, there is no larger symbol than M (1,000). This method isn't commonly used, but it's good to know how it works.

, This reduces the possibility of making a mistake when trying to determine whether a ratio is dimensionless or not.

, If they are, they will cancel each other out.

, Sometimes, the units might appear as different, but in fact, one of them is derived and can be expressed as the other.

For example, if the physical quantity above the fraction bar is force (unit is N) and below is a product of mass (kg) and a quotient of the distance traveled (m) and squared value of the time interval (s^2), the whole fraction would equal only a number (a dimensionless result), since =.







, Some SI units have other forms, and they can be easily converted one into the other if their ratio is given.

For example, mass can also be expressed in grams which is a kilogram divided by a thousand, or in ounces (0.028kg).

Solve the following problem.",How to Find the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence," An arithmetic sequence is an ordered series of numbers, in which the change in numbers is constant.This method only works if your set of numbers is an arithmetic sequence.

To determine whether you have an arithmetic sequence, find the difference between the first few and the last few numbers. Ensure that the difference is always the same.

For example, the series 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 is an arithmetic sequence, because the difference between each term is constant (5).
;
, Each number is a term. If there are only a few terms listed, you can count them. Otherwise, if you know the first term, last term, and common difference (the difference between each term) you can  use a formula to find the number of terms. Let this number be represented by the variable n{\displaystyle n}.

For example, if you are calculating the sum of the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, n=5{\displaystyle n=5}, since there are 5 terms in the sequence.


, You need to know both of these numbers in order to calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence. Often the first numbers will be 1, but not always. Let the variable a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} equal the first term in the sequence, and an{\displaystyle a_{n}} equal the last term in the sequence.

For example, in the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 a1=10{\displaystyle a_{1}=10}, and an=30{\displaystyle a_{n}=30}.


, The formula is Sn=n(a1+an2){\displaystyle S_{n}=n({\frac {a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}})}, where Sn{\displaystyle S_{n}} equals the sum of the sequence.Note that this formula is indicating that the sum of the arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms., Make sure you make the correct substitutions. 

For example, if you have 5 terms in your sequence, and 10 is the first term, and 30 is the last term, your formula will look like this: Sn=5(10+302){\displaystyle S_{n}=5({\frac {10+30}{2}})}.


, To do this, add the two numbers, and divide by 2.

For example:Sn=5(402){\displaystyle S_{n}=5({\frac {40}{2}})}Sn=5(20){\displaystyle S_{n}=5(20)}


, This will give you the sum of the arithmetic sequence.

For example: Sn=5(20){\displaystyle S_{n}=5(20)}Sn=100{\displaystyle S_{n}=100}So, the sum of the sequence 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 is 100.


, Consider all consecutive integers.

Determine the number of terms (n{\displaystyle n}) in the sequence. Since you are considering all consecutive integers to 500, n=500{\displaystyle n=500}.

Determine the first (a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}) and last (an{\displaystyle a_{n}}) terms in the sequence. Since the sequence is 1 to 500, a1=1{\displaystyle a_{1}=1} and an=500{\displaystyle a_{n}=500}.

Find the average of a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} and an{\displaystyle a_{n}}: 1+5002=250.5{\displaystyle {\frac {1+500}{2}}=250.5}.

Multiply the average by n{\displaystyle n}: 250.5×500=125,250{\displaystyle 250.5\times 500=125,250}.


, The first term in the sequence is 3. The last term in the sequence is 24. The common difference is 7.

Determine the number of terms (n{\displaystyle n}) in the sequence. Since you begin with 3, end with 24, and go up by 7 each time, the series is 3, 10, 17, 24. (The common difference is the difference between each term in the sequence.)This means that n=4{\displaystyle n=4}

Determine the first (a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}) and last (an{\displaystyle a_{n}}) terms in the sequence. Since the sequence is 3 to 24, a1=3{\displaystyle a_{1}=3} and an=24{\displaystyle a_{n}=24}.

Find the average of a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} and an{\displaystyle a_{n}}: 3+242=13.5{\displaystyle {\frac {3+24}{2}}=13.5}.

Multiply the average by n{\displaystyle n}: 13.5×4=54{\displaystyle 13.5\times 4=54}.


, Mara saves 5 dollars the first week of the year. For the rest of the year, she increases her weekly savings by 5 dollars every week. How much money does Mara save by the end of the year?

Determine the number of terms (n{\displaystyle n}) in the sequence. Since Mara save for 52 weeks (1 year), n=52{\displaystyle n=52}.

Determine the first (a1{\displaystyle a_{1}}) and last (an{\displaystyle a_{n}}) terms in the sequence. The first amount she saves is 5 dollars, so a1=5{\displaystyle a_{1}=5}. To find out the amount she saves the last week of the year, calculate 5×52=260{\displaystyle 5\times 52=260}. So an=260{\displaystyle a_{n}=260}.

Find the average of a1{\displaystyle a_{1}} and an{\displaystyle a_{n}}: 5+2602=132.5{\displaystyle {\frac {5+260}{2}}=132.5}.

Multiply the average by n{\displaystyle n}: 135.5×52=6,890{\displaystyle 135.5\times 52=6,890}. So she saves $6,890 by the end of the year.

Identify the value for which you want to find a corresponding value.,
Find the closest values below and above the value of x in the table or on the graph.,
Find the interpolated value mathematically.",How to Interpolate," Interpolation can be used for such things as finding a logarithm or trigonometric function value or for the corresponding gas pressure or volume for a given temperature in chemistry. Because scientific calculators have largely replaced logarithmic and trigonometric tables, we’ll use as our example for finding an interpolated value that of finding the pressure of a gas for a temperature whose value isn’t listed in the reference table or as a graph point.


For the equation we’ll derive, we’ll represent the value that we want to find a corresponding value for as ‘’x’’ and the interpolated value we want to find as ‘’y’’. (We’ll use these labels, because on a graph, the value we know would be plotted on the horizontal, or x-axis, and the value we’re trying to find would be plotted on the vertical, or y-axis.)
Our ‘’x’’ value will be the temperature of the gas, which for this example will be 37 °C (99 °F).;
, Our reference table doesn’t give a gas pressure for 37 °C (99 °F), but it does list values for 30 °C (86 °F) and 40 °C (104 °F). The gas pressure at 30 °C (86 °F) is 3 kilopascals (kPa) and the pressure at 40 °C (104 °F) is 5 kPa.


Because we’re representing the temperature of 37 °C (99 °F) with ‘’x’’, we’ll represent the temperature of 30 degrees as ‘’x1’’ and the value of 40 degrees as ‘’x2’’.






Because we’re representing the pressure were trying to find with ‘’y’’, we’ll represent the pressure of 3 kPa at 30 °C (86 °F) as ‘’y1’’ and the pressure of 5 kPa at 40 °C (104 °F) as ‘’y2’’.







, The equation for finding the interpolated value can be written as y = y1 + ((x – x1)/(x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1))Plugging in the values for x, x1, and x/2 in their places gives (37 – 30)/(40 -30), which reduces to 7/10 or 0.7.






Plugging in the values for y1 and y2 at the end of the equation gives (5 – 3) or 2.






Multiplying 0.7 by 2 gives a product of 1.4. Adding 1.4 to the value of y1, or 3, gives a value of 4.4 kPa. Checking this against our original values, 4.4 falls between 3 kPa at 30 °C (86 °F) and 5 kPa at 40 °C (104 °F), and because 37 is closer to 40 than it is to 30, the result should be closer to 5 kPa than it is to 3 kPa.

Take your data and analyze your variables.,
Plot each point.,
Plot all your points and draw a line of best fit.This is a smooth line or curve that follows the dots as best as possible without making sharp corners.,
Figure out the slope of the line.,
Find the y-intercept.",How to Graph1," Your variables are the two things that have been measured. You need to determine which axis you want each variable to lie; the general rule is that the independent variable, or the factor you control lies on the x-axis, whereas whatever you measure in relation to that is the dependent variable.









For example, if you are measuring how changing the amount of water fed to a sunflower plant affects growth, you would control how much water you give each sunflower plant and measure each plant’s growth after a fixed amount of time. Because the amount of water is controlled, the amount of water given each day would be recorded on the x-axis. It is understood that you expect plant growth to be dependent on how much water you give; therefore, it is dependent on the independent variable, and would be recorded on the y-axis.;
, Each data point has two numbers: the x-value and the y-value. These come in pairs and create a link between the two variables.









For example, if a plant that is watered 2 cups of water a day grows 6 inches (15.2 cm) in three weeks, its x-value is 2 (because it represents the variable that is controlled: water) and its y-value is 6 (because that is the variable that is measured: plant growth).

, This line does not necessarily have to go right through each point as long as it the curve is as smooth as possible and runs very close to as many points as possible.









This line represents the relationship between your two variables. For example, in the case of watering plants, giving too little water will completely dry out your plant and keep it from growing, but giving too much water will drown the plant and make it rot. Therefore, growth is very low for very low or very high quantities of water, and highest when the quantity of water is somewhere in between. The amount of water that causes the most growth is the highest point on the line

, The slope is how much the y-value increases when the x-value increases by 1.









On a straight line, the slope is constant. This is because the line does not ever get any steeper or flatter. As x increases, y increases by a constant amount, creating a straight line.
On a flat, horizontal line, the slope is 0. This is because no matter how x changes, the change in y is always zero.
On a vertical line, the slope is undefined. This is because you can’t measure how y changes with x because x never changes.
On a curved line, the slope is not constant. This is because the line changes in steepness as you go across; one unit of change in the x-axis does not always create the same change in the y-axis.
On a line with equation y=mx+b, the slope is m. This is because when x changes, y increases or decreases by the m multiplied by however much x changes. So, if x increases by 1, y increases by m.

, This is the value at which the line crosses the y-axis.









Note that every point on the y-axis has an x-value of 0. So, the y-intercept generally refers to the y-value at which the line crosses the y-axis.
On a line with equation y=mx+b, the y-intercept is b and lies at point (0,b). This can be shown by plugging in 0 for x.

y = m*0 + b = b


You can find the y-intercept for any equation with variables x and y by simply plugging in x=0 and solving for y.

Figure out how the graph works.,
Understand the equation.,
To convert polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, use the equations x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ, giving the coordinate (rcosθ, rsinθ).








",How to Graph2," A polar coordinate has two values: (r,θ). r is the distance from the center to the point and θ is the the angle between the terminal axis and the line connecting the center and the point.








, r is dependent on θ, meaning that as the equation goes around the center, the distance from the center r changes accordingly.









A circle has the equation r=k, where k is a constant number. This is because no matter the value of theta, the equation is always a set distance from the center. As you may recall that is the definition of a circle; the set of all points equidistant from a single point.

Triangle ABC is an obtuse angled triangle having the obtuse angle at C. Squares are constructed on each of the three sides AB, BC and AC. Further, BC is extended and from A, a perpendicular is dropped on the extended portion of BC which meets it at D.;
,
We need to prove that the square constructed on the side which subtends the obtuse angle (the side AB) is larger than the other two squares taken together by twice the rectangle contained by either of the other two sides (say BC) and its extension (CD, in this case). This can be done if we prove that the area of the square constructed on side AB equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides plus twice the area of the rectangle which can be formed by BC and CD.
Mathematically, we need to prove that

Find the sum of the ""basic numbers"" substituted for Day, Month, Year, Remainder left after dividing Century by 4, and Leap Year.,
Divide the sum by 7.,
In this ever-changing world, only the Sun and the Moon and a few Planets can be said to have some permanency.,
The rotation of the Earth around the Sun, the dawn of the morning, the coming of the night, were the first measurements of time.,
The year was further divided into months.,
The time taken by the earth to complete one revolution round the Sun, in our current Unit, is odd and not totally accurate, thus arose the leap year every 4th year.,
Now dividing 365 days by 12 leaves a balance and due to this, there was unevenness in the number of days in a month and again the number of weeks does not divide the month and the year fully and as such it is difficult to say exactly what day of the week will fall in a particular month.,
To construct such a calendar, look back upon how we defined our months and years.,
52x7 = 364.,
The 29th day in February changes our calculations, from the month of March onwards in the leap year and permanently for all other years.,
Starting from the 1st January of any one year and knowing the day in that month, we can thus prepare the frame work of our perpetual calendar without going into further details.,
For January, given the number 1, for February the number 4 (in view of what is explained earlier in clue (1)), March number 4, April number 0 (instead of 7 as division by 7 leaves remainder zero and we have 7 days in a week), May number 2, and so on.

, Our ancestors, as such relied on the Sun and moon for their measurement of TIME.;
, The coming of the full Moon periodically was a second measure of time. The changing seasons and their recurrence was a third measure of time. Different Nations had their own notions of measurement of time, but the most prevalent one today is the Gregorian Calendar, which has taken its definition of a year from the time taken by the Earth to revolve once round the Sun and each minute consisting of 60 seconds.

, The number of months had their origin from the number of Gods in ancient Greek mythology. These months were further sub-divided into days, the day itself being measured by the time taken by the Earth to rotate once around its axis. The days were further sub-divided, in this conception of time, into 24 hours, each hour consisting of 60 minutes. For convenience, the days were grouped into what we call Weeks. Perhaps people wanted to take time off from their hard work and also wanted to keep aside some time for their spiritual well-being. The week thus came to be divided into seven days, Sunday being, generally, considered a day of rest and set aside amongst Christians for Mass Prayers. Other religions too have, in general, one day set aside for prayers.

, A normal year consists of 365 days, with leap year having 366 days. This adjustment was, however, not enough and a further adjustment required that there should be no leap year every 100th year, but again every 400th year has to be a leap year to keep the timing in tune with the rotation of Earth.

, From this arises the need for a perpetual calendar, which will meet the needs of people for all times to come.

, If we start from 1st January of a particular year, we find that the day on 1st February will differ from the day in January by three. The day on 1st March, other than in Leap year, will be the same as on 1st February. The day on 1st April will be three more than that on March and so on. From this, we get the first clue for our calculations.

, Therefore, 1st January of the next year will be different from the previous year by one, except in the leap year when it will differ by 2. This gives us the second clue for our calculations.

, This, along with the fact that the year ‘00’ will be a leap year only once in four times, gives us our third and practically the final clue for our calculations.

, Here is the final results. Let us assign one number to each day of the week for convenience, we will start with Sunday as number Zero, Monday as One and so on.

,
Start with the tutorial.,
Go to level 2.,
Tackle small goals one at a time.,
Don't worry about money.,
Don't worry much about being caught.",How to Play Bob the Robber on Coolmath,", Officially, the game has 5 levels. However, in the first level you are robbing a barn, and it helps you along every step.

Control Bob with the arrow keys or WSAD, and scan through crates and items with up arrow or W. Your down arrow key or S key doesn't do anything, though. Just follow the letters, grab the money, and get out safely.

, You'll have to dodge security cameras, and policeman to sneak past. Just stay in the shadows to hide from the cameras, and whack the cops with your baton (space bar).

Tackle each step logically. Many of the levels are a puzzle, and it's good to think, ""Where is the game leading me?""

, Think how to bypass the next barrier, whether it's hiding in the shadows, or finding a password for the doorway. Make small goals for each level, and make sure to not set off the alarm!, You can always replay levels; the main point is to beat level 5, not get all the money/best score each level. If you beat a level, you can go back and try to get as much money as you can., There is no penalty; you will just have to restart the current level. In some ways, being caught will allow you to refresh your mind, and a quick run-through of a level will tell you the layout and the traps that lie ahead."

Understand the objective of the game.,
Gather the materials.,
Know how to read the dice.,
Understand the role of the red chip.,
Remember the game strategy.,
Set up the game.,
Roll and arrange the dice.,
Use Mind Attacks or Strength Attacks to steal the opponent's dice.",How to Play Maths Warrior," The goal of the game is for players to use math in order to capture their opponent's dice - whoever captures all of their opponent's dice first is the winner of the game. In order to capture dice, there are two mathematical ""attacks"" that can be used:


Mind Attack: To use the Mind Attack, players must make a mathematical calculation using the numbers on the dice that have been rolled. For example, if they want to steal their opponent's die with an 8 on it, they must use their own dice to make a calculation that will add up to 8, such as 1 + 2 + 5. Depending on the math abilities of the players, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division can be used as well.

Strength Attack: No mathematical calculations are required to use Strength Attack; instead, players simply need to play a dice with the same or higher value as the one they want to capture. For example, if they want to steal their opponent's die with an 8 on it, they must play one of their own dice with either an 8 or a higher number.;
, Maths Warrior is played with 12 dice of different sides (6 dice per player), as well as a flat game board. A small red chip is also used. The dice that will be needed include:

Two 4-sided dice
Two 6-sided dice
Two 8-sided dice
Two 10-sided dice
Two 12-sided dice
Two 20-sided dice

, On the 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice, there is only one number on each face, so when those dice are rolled, the number facing the top is the number used. However, on the 4-sided dice, there are 3 numbers on each face, and each number is facing a different direction. When this dice is rolled, the number that is on the bottom of the face is used (this will be the only number in the correct direction - the other numbers will be upside-down)., This chip is known as the ""Penalty Chip"", meaning that the owner of the chip can have their Strength Attack blocked by the other player. This chip is typically used in the last round of play when each player only has one die left (and therefore Strength Attacks are the only possible move to win). If the Penalty Chip is used, the dice are not re-rolled and the other player can immediately take their turn, use a Strength Attack, and win the game., Basic Maths Warrior strategy is to try to attack your opponent's dice with the most sides first (since these have bigger numbers and have a better chance of winning Strength Attacks against you), and to try and use a bunch of lower numbers to attack rather than using one big number (this way you can re-roll your lower numbers to try and get bigger numbers to use next time)., Have the two players sit across from each other at a table or a desk. Give six dice to each player (one 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided die each), and place the game board in the middle of the desk between the two players. Place the red chip in the middle of the game board for now., To begin the game, have both players roll all of their dice and arrange them on the game board in descending order (from biggest to smallest). Whichever player has the smallest die will make the first move, and also gets the Penalty Chip, which can now be moved from the game board to beside this player. If both players have the same smallest number, they now have to compare their second-smallest number to see who will start first and get the Penalty Chip., The player who had the smaller number can now capture one of their opponent's dice using a Mind or Strength attack. Once they have captured a dice, they remove that dice from the game board and keep it beside them (this die can no longer be used in game play). They then re-roll any of their own dice that they used to capture the opponent's die and place them back on the game board in order. Once this is done, the next player may take their turn. This process repeats itself until all of the dice have been captured."

Know the order of operations.,
Start by solving all of the terms in parentheses.,
Solve the exponents.,
Solve the multiplication problems in your expression.,
Move on to division.,
Add.,
Subtract.,
Review your expression.",How to Simplify Math Expressions1," When simplifying math expressions, you can't simply proceed from left to right, multiplying, adding, subtracting, and so on as you go. Some math operations take precedence over others and must be done first. In fact, doing operations out of order can give you the wrong answer. The order of operations is: terms in parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and, finally, subtraction. A handy acronym you can use to remember this is ""Please excuse my Dear Aunt Sally,"" or ""PEMDAS"".


Note that, while basic knowledge of the order of operations makes it possible to simplify most basic expressions, specialized techniques are needed to simplify many variable expressions, including nearly all polynomials. See Method Two below for more information.;
, In math, parentheses indicate that the terms inside should be calculated separately from the surrounding expression. Regardless of the operations being performed within them, be sure to tackle the terms in parentheses as your first act when you attempt to simplify an expression. Note that, however, within each pair of parentheses, the order of operations still applies. For instance, within parentheses, you should multiply before you add, subtract, etc.


As an example, let's try to simplify the expression 2x + 4(5 + 2) + 32 - (3 + 4/2). In this expression, we would solve the terms in parentheses, 5 + 2 and 3 + 4/2, first. 5 + 2 = 7. 3 + 4/2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

The second parenthetical term simplifies to 5 because, owing to the order of operations, we divide 4/2 as our first act inside the parentheses. If we simply went from left to right, we might instead add 3 and 4 first, then divide by 2, giving the incorrect answer of 7/2.


Note - if there are multiple parentheses nested inside one another, solve the innermost terms first, than the second-innermost, and so on.

, After tackling parentheses, next, solve your expression's exponents. This is easy to remember because, in exponents, the base number and the power are positioned right next to each other. Find the answer to each exponent problem, then substitute the answers back into your equation in place of the exponents themselves.


After dealing with the parentheses, our example expression is now 2x + 4(7) + 32 - 5. The only exponent in our example is 32, which equals 9. Add this back into the equation in the place of 32 to get 2x + 4(7) + 9 - 5.

, Next, perform any necessary multiplication in your expression. Remember that multiplication can be written several ways. A × symbol, a dot, or an asterisk are all ways to show multiplication. However, a number hugging a parentheses or a variable (like 4(x)) also denotes multiplication.


There are two instances of multiplication in our problem: 2x (2x is 2 × x) and 4(7). We don't know the value of x, so let's leave 2x as it is.. 4(7) = 4 × 7 = 28. We can rewrite our equation as 2x + 28 + 9 - 5.

, As you search for division problems in your expression, keep in mind that, like multiplication, division can be written multiple ways. The simple ÷ symbol is one, but also remember that slashes and bars in a fraction (like 3/4, for instance) signify division.


Because we already solved a division problem (4/2) when we tackled the terms in parentheses, our example no longer has any division in it, so we will skip this step. This brings up an important point - you don't have to perform every operation in the PEMDAS acronym when simplifying an expression, just the ones that are present in your problem.

, Next, perform any addition problems in your expression. You can simply proceed from left to right through your expression, but you may find it easiest to add numbers that combine in simple, manageable ways first. For instance, in the expression 49 + 29 + 51 +71, it's easier to add 49 + 51 = 100, 29 + 71 = 100, and 100 + 100 = 200, rather than 49 + 29 = 78, 78 + 51 = 129, and 129 + 71 = 200.


Our example expression has been partially simplified to ""2x + 28 + 9 - 5"". Now, we must add what we can - let's look at each addition problem from left to right. We can't add 2x and 28 because we don't know the value of x, so let's skip it. 28 + 9 = 37, so let's rewrite or expression as ""2x + 37 - 5"".

, The very last step in PEMDAS is subtraction. Proceed through your problem, solving any remaining subtraction problems. You may address the addition of negative numbers in this step, or in the same step as the normal addition problems - it won't effect your answer..


In our expression, ""2x + 37 - 5"", there is only one subtraction problem. 37 - 5 = 32


, After proceeding through the order of operations, you should be left with your expression in simplest terms. However, if your expression contains one or more variables, understand that the variable terms will remain largely untouched. Simplifying variable expressions requires you to find the values of your variables or to use specialized techniques to simplify the expression (see below).


Our final answer is ""2x + 32"". We can't address this final addition problem until we know the value of x, but when we do, this expression will be much easier to solve than our initial lengthy expression.

"
"
Add like variable terms.,
Simplify numerical fractions by dividing or ""canceling out"" factors.,
In variable fractions, cancel out variable factors.,
Multiply parenthetical terms by their constants.,
Simplify by factoring.",How to Simplify Math Expressions2," When dealing with variable expressions, it's important to remember that terms with the same variable and exponent (or ""like terms"") can be added and subtracted like normal numbers. The terms must not only have the same variable, but also the same exponent. For example, 7x and 5x can be added to each other, but 7x and 5x2 can not.


This rule also extends to terms with multiple variables. For instance, 2xy2 can be added to -3xy2, but not -3x2y or -3y2.
Let's look at the expression x2 + 3x + 6 - 8x. In this expression, we can add the 3x and -8x terms because they are like terms. Simplified, our expression is x2 - 5x + 6.

, Fractions that have only numbers (and no variables) in both the numerator and denominator can be simplified in several ways. First, and perhaps easiest, is to simply treat the fraction as a division problem and divide the denominator by the numerator. In addition, any multiplicative factors that appear both in the numerator and denominator can be ""canceled"" because they divide to give the number 1. In other words, if both the numerator and denominator share a factor, this factor can be removed from the fraction, leaving a simplified answer.


For example, let's consider the fraction 36/60. If we have a calculator handy, we can divide to get an answer of .6. If we don't, however, we can still simplify by removing common factors. Another way to think of 36/60 is (6 × 6)/(6 × 10). This can be rewritten as 6/6 × 6/10. 6/6 = 1, so our expression is actually 1 × 6/10 = 6/10. However, we're not done yet - both 6 and 10 share the factor 2. Repeating the above procedure, we are left with 3/5.

, Variable expressions in the form of fractions offer unique opportunities for simplification. Like normal fractions, variable fractions allow you to remove factors that are shared by both the numerator and denominator. However, in variable fractions, these factors can be both numbers and actual variable expressions.


Let's consider the expression (3x2 + 3x)/(-3x2 + 15x).This fraction can be rewritten as (x + 1)(3x)/(3x)(5 - x), 3x appears both in the numerator and in the denominator. Removing these factors from the equation leaves (x + 1)/(5 - x). Similarly, in the expression (2x2 + 4x + 6)/2, since every term is divisible by 2, we can write the expression as (2(x2 + 2x + 3))/2 and thus simplify to x2 + 2x + 3.
Note that you can't cancel just any term - you can only cancel multiplicative factors that appear both in the numerator and denominator. For instance, in the expression (x(x + 2))/x, the ""x"" cancels from both the numerator and denominator, leaving (x + 2)/1 = (x + 2). However, (x + 2)/x does not cancel to 2/1 = 2.

, When dealing with variable terms in parentheses with an adjacent constant, sometimes, multiplying each term in the parentheses by the constant can result in a simpler expression. This holds true for purely numeric constants and for constants that include variables.


For instance, the expression 3(x2 + 8) can be simplified to 3x2 + 24, while 3x(x2 + 8) can be simplified to 3x3 + 24x.
Note that, in some cases, such as in variable fractions, the constant adjacent to the parentheses gives an opportunity for cancellation and thus shouldn't be multiplied through the parentheses. In the fraction (3(x2 + 8))/3x, for instance, the factor 3 appears both in the numerator and the denominator, so we can cancel it and simplify the expression to (x2 + 8)/x. This is simpler and easier to work with than (3x3 + 24x)/3x, which would be the answer we would get if we had multiplied through.

, Factoring is a technique by which some variable expressions, including polynomials, can be simplified. Think of factoring as the opposite of the ""multiplying through parentheses"" step above - sometimes, an expression can be rendered more simply as two terms multiplied by each other, rather than as one unified expression. This is especially true if factoring an expression allows you to cancel part of it (as you would in a fraction). In special cases (often with quadratic equations), factoring even allows you to find answers to the equation.


Let's consider the expression x2 - 5x + 6 once more. This expression can factor to (x - 3)(x - 2). So, if x2 - 5x + 6 is the numerator of a certain expression with one of these factor terms in the denominator, like is the case with the expression (x2 - 5x + 6)/(2(x - 2)), we may want to write it in factored form so that we can cancel it with the denominator. In other words, with (x - 3)(x - 2)/(2(x - 2)), the (x - 2) terms cancel, leaving us with (x - 3)/2.
As hinted at above, another reason you may want to factor your expression has to do with the fact that factoring can reveal answers to certain equations, especially when those equations are written as expressions equal to 0. For instance, let's consider the equation x2 - 5x + 6 = 0. Factoring gets us (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0. Since any number times zero equals zero, we know that if we can get either of the terms of parentheses to equal zero, the whole expression on the left side of the equals sign will equal zero as well. Thus, 3 and 2 are two answers to the equation.

Learn what hexadecimal is.,
Learn how to write bases.,
Understand place values in decimal.,
Learn the hexadecimal place values.,
Convert from hexadecimal to decimal.",How to Understand Hexadecimal1," Just like the decimal number system uses ten different symbols to denote values from Zero to Nine, the hexadecimal number system uses sixteen different symbols to denote values from Zero to Fifteen. Any number can be written in either system. Here's how to start counting in hexadecimal:


zero through fifteen: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
sixteen through thirty-two: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 20;
, The ten symbols used in the decimal number system form the base of the decimal number system. Similarly, the sixteen symbols used in the hexadecimal number system form the base of the hexadecimal number system. Whenever it's unclear which base is being used, subscript numbers are added to show the base. For example, 10010 is ""100 in base 10"" and 10016 is ""100 in base 16"" (which equals 409610).


Another term for ""base"" is ""radix"" (pluralized ""radixes"" or ""radices"").

, We can understand long numbers written in base 10 without even pausing to think, but that's only because we've had a lot of practice. We know automatically that ""583410"" means 5x103 + 8x102 + 3x101 + 4x100. Each digit in a multi-digit number has its own place value. Here are the place values in decimal, from right to left:


10010 = 1
10110 = 1010

102 = 10x10 = 100
103 = 10x10x10 = 1000
104 = 10x10x10x10 = 10000
105 = 10x10x10x10x10 = 100000 & so on.

, Since hexadecimal is base sixteen, the place values are based on powers of sixteen, not powers of ten. Here are the powers of sixteen, written in decimal.


16010 = 1

16110 = 1610

162=16x16=256

163=16x16x16=4096

164=16x16x16x16=65536

165=16x16x16x16x16=1048576 & so on.
If we write these in hexadecimal, these would instead be written as 1016, 100, 1000, etc.

, Converting between two bases is a good way to become familiar with how each system works. Here's how to convert from any number in hexadecimal to the same number written in decimal:


Write out your hexadecimal number: 15B3016

Write each digit out as a decimal multiplication problem, using the place value in the chart above: 15B30 = (1 x 6553610) + (5 x 409610) + (B x 25610) + (3 x 1610) + (0 x 1)

Convert non-decimal symbols into decimal numbers. In our example, B = 1110, so that digit can be converted to 1110 x 25610

Solve the problem. Use a calculator or work it out by hand, and you'll get the answer in decimal. 15B30 = 65536 + 20480 + 2816 + 48 + 0 = 8888010

Understand how colors on a computer screen are determined.,
Learn why hexadecimal is used for colors.,
Understand how the system works.",How to Understand Hexadecimal2," All colors on a computer screen are determined by three values: red, green, and blue. All colors of light can be created by combining these three types of light in different proportions.On a computer screen, red, green, and blue can each be assigned any value from 0 to 255 (for a total of 256 possible values).


This doesn't match the ""primary"" colors you learned in school, because that color system is based on physical pigment (like paint), not light. The paint system is sometimes called ""subtractive color system"" and the light system (the rgb system described here) ""additive."", HTML uses hexadecimal to describe colors. This is convenient, since a two-digit hexadecimal number can communicate exactly 25610 possible values. This isn't a coincidence; the number 25610 is due to limitations of old hardware, which could only handle 1000000002 colors, or 25610. Because 24 = 1610, any binary system can be easily converted to a hexadecimal system with ¼ as many digits.


The subscript numbers tell you which base the numbers is written in. Base2 is binary, base10 is ordinary decimal, and base16 is hexadecimal.

, The hexadecimal color system is easy to understand, once you know how it works. The first two digits are the red value, the next two are the green value, and the last two are the blue value. Here are some examples:


#000000 is black, while #FFFFFF is white.
Any color with equal r, g, and b values (besides black and white) is a shade of grey, such as #121212, #5A5A5A, or #C0C0C0
#003000 is a very dark green. #003F00 is barely any lighter (you've only added F, or 1610 green), but #00FF00 is the brightest possible green (adding an additional C0, or 19210).
More complex colors are created by using all three types of light. Try to guess #7FFFD4, #8A2BE2, or #A0522D.

Teach yourself to read hexadecimal intuitively.,
Learn hexadecimal addition.,
Learn hexadecimal multiplication.",How to Understand Hexadecimal3," Use the examples below as ""milestones"" to help you estimate the size of a hexadecimal number. This will give you a more intuitive understanding of hexadecimal, and let you read hexadecimal numbers without laboriously converting to decimal every time. As you'll see, one advantage to hexadecimal is that the number of digits doesn't increase nearly as fast as it does in decimal:


Humans have A fingers, or 1416 if you count the toes too. (Remember, the subscript 16 means a number is written in base sixteen.)
In a residential area, drive below 1916 miles per hour (or 2816 kilometers per hour).
A typical highway driving speed is 3C mph (or 6416 kph).
Water boils at D4 ºFahrenheit (6416 º Celsius).
The median U.S. income is roughly C350 dollars a year.
The population of the world is over 1A0,000,000.

, You can do hexadecimal addition problems without ever converting to another system. It does take some mental effort and practice to remember the new rules. Here are a few methods and tips:


Count up one by one, using hexadecimal digits. For instance to solve 7+5 in hex, count 7, 8, 9, A, B, C.
Learn the addition tables. A much faster method is to memorize the hexadecimal addition tables, which you can practice with an online quiz.Once you know that A + 7 = 1116, you don't have to laboriously count it out any more.
Carry the one when needed. If your addition gets you past F, you ""carry the one"" as you would in a normal addition problem. For example, A+5 = F, A+6 = 1016, A+7 = 1116, and so on. Similarly, 3A+6 = 4016, 3A+7 = 4116, etc.

, Just like regular multiplication, the best way to become competent at hexadecimal multiplication is to memorize the multiplication tables. Here's the hex ""6 times table"" as an example (all numbers are hexadecimal):


6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = C
6 x 3 = 12
6 x 4 = 18
6 x 5 = 1E
6 x 6 = 24
6 x 7 = 2A
6 x 8 = 30
6 x 9 = 36
6 x A = 3C
6 x B = 42
6 x C = 48
6 x D = 4E
6 x E = 54
6 x F = 5A

5 = five
6 = six
7 = seven
8 = eight
9 = nine;
, Do you see how many of them look just like the numbers above, plus ""teen"" at the end? ""Sixteen"" (16) just means ""six and ten"" (6 + 10).


10 = ten
11 = eleven
12 = twelve
13 = thirteen
14 = fourteen
15 = fifteen
16 = sixteen
17 = seventeen
18 = eighteen
19 = nineteen

, Here's how to write 20, 30, 40, and so on all the way to 100. You can recognize these numbers because they end in ""ty"" except 100).


20 = twenty
30 = thirty
40 = forty
50 = fifty
60 = sixty
70 = seventy
80 = eighty
90 = ninety

, Now you can write any number from 1 to 100. Let's see how it works for the number 42:


42 is written with two numbers: 4 2.
2 is in the ones place, so this just equals 2. Write this as two.
4 is in the tens place, so this is actually 40. Write this as forty.
Write the two parts together: forty-two. Don't forget the - sign between them.

, This part's easy if you remember the basics. Just write the number as usual and add ""hundred:""


100 = one hundred
200 = two hundred
300 = three hundred (and so on)

, Just write the hundreds place, then the rest of the number. You don't need to write ""and"" or anything else between them. Here are some examples:


120 = one hundred twenty
405 = four hundred five
556 = five hundred fifty-six
999 = nine hundred ninety-nine

, Try writing a few numbers as words. Work on these, then highlight the space after the = sign to see if you're right:


21 = twenty-one

37 = thirty-seven

49 = forty-nine

255 = two hundred fifty-five

876 = eight hundred seventy-six


, We can tell what each digit in a number means based on where it is. Here's what the first 9 place values are called:1 → the ones place.

10 → the tens place.

100 → the hundreds place.

1,000 → the thousands place.

10,000 → the ten thousands place.

100,000 → the hundred thousands place.

1000,000 → the millions place.

10,000,000 → the ten millions place.

100,000,000 → the hundred millions place.

, Start from the right side of the number, at the ones place. Count three digits to the left, then add a comma. Keep separating the number in groups of three.


For example, turn 458735 into 458,735.
Write 1510800 as 1,510,800.
You can use a period instead if that's how people in your country write numbers.

, Look at the two digits at the end of the number. This part is just like writing a normal two-digit number.


5,467,350 looks hard, but don't worry. Start with just the 50 at the end. Write this as fifty.

, The next digit is the hundreds place. This is an easy one. Just write the number in that place, then add the word ""hundred."" Write this in front of your number.


In 5,467,350, the 3 is the hundreds place. Write this as 'three hundred.
Now we have 'three hundred fifty.

, You just wrote the hundreds, tens, and ones place. The next three numbers are the thousands ""chunk."" These are the hundred thousands, ten thousands, and one thousands. Write these the same way, then add the word ""thousand.""In 5,467,350, the 467 is the thousands chunk.
Write the 4 as four hundred.
Write the 67 as sixty-seven.
Write the whole chunk as four hundred sixty-seven thousand.
Now we have four hundred sixty-seven thousand, three hundred fifty.

, The next chunk of three numbers are the millions. These are the hundred millions, ten millions, and one millions. This is just the same as before, but with millions at the end.


In 5,467,350, we only have a 5 in the millions place.
Write this as five million.
Finish writing the number: five million, four hundred sixty-seven thousand, three hundred fifty.

Look at the problem.,
Add the numbers together.,
Write your final answer.",How to Write Numbers in Standard Form1," A number written in expanded form will look very similar to an addition problem. Each place value will be written out separately, but all of the place values should be linked together with plus signs.



Example: Write the following number in standard form: 3000 + 500 + 20 + 9 + 0.8 + 0.01;
, Since expanded form looks like an addition problem, the simplest way to convert it to standard form is simply by adding the separate place values together.


Essentially, you will be removing all of the zero (0) place value holders and combining the remaining digits accordingly.

Example: 3000 + 500 + 20 + 9 + 0.8 + 0.01 = 3529.81

, You should be left with the standard form of the original expanded number—the final answer for this type of problem.



Example: The standard form of the original number is: 3529.81

Use the perfect percentage method for the following sorts of problems: ""If a shirt that costs $40 is reduced to $32, what percentage of a discount is this?,
Decide which number represents the original amount and which represents the ""after amount."",
Divide the ""after amount"" by the original amount.,
Move the decimal point two places to the right to change it from a decimal to a percent.,
Compare that percentage to 100%.,
Compare your percentage to 100%.,
Practice on the following examples.",How to Work With Percentages of Increase and Decrease1,""";
, The amount that exists after the percentage has been applied can also be called the ""new amount"".


For our question, we do not know the percent. We know that $40 is the original, and that's $32 is the ""after.""

, Make sure the ""after amount"" goes into the calculator first.


For our example, type 32, hit divide, type 40, hit equals.
This division gives us: 0.8. (It's not the final answer.)

, For our sample problem, 0.8 changes to 80%.

, If your answer is smaller than 100%, you have a decrease or discount; larger than 100% is an increase.


Because the price in the example dropped, and the price that we calculated is also a discount, we're on the right path.
If the price in the example dropped from $40 to $32, however, and we got 120% after our calculation, we'd know that something is wrong because we're looking for a discount and we got an increase.

, Figure out how much above or below 100% you are and this will be your final answer. In our sample problem, 80% compared to 100% means that we had a discount of 20%.

, To get the hang of things, read the prompt and see if you understand how to finish the following problems:


Problem #1: ""A $50 blouse is now $28. What was the percentage of discount?""

To solve it, grab a calculator. Enter '28,' hit divide, enter '50,' hit equals; the answer is 0.56.
Convert '0.56' to '56%'. Compare this number to 100%, subtracting '56' from '100', leaving us with a discount of 44%.


Problem #2: ""A $12 baseball cap is $15 after tax. What was the sales tax percentage?""

To solve it, grab a calculator. Enter '15', hit divide, enter '12', hit equals; the answer is 1.25.
Convert '1.25' to '125%'. Compare this to 100%, subtracting '100' from '125', leaving us with an increase of 25%.

"
Look at the problem.,
Write each word in numerical form.,
Add the numbers together.,
Write your final answer.",How to Write Numbers in Standard Form2," Instead of being written out in numerical values, the original number should be written out in word form.



Example: Write seven-thousand nine-hundred forty-three and two-tenths in standard form.

The value “seven-thousand nine-hundred forty-three and two-tenths” is the word form of number you need to convert to standard form. This number will need to be rewritten in numerical values before you can change it into its final standard form.



, Look at each separate value written in word form. Working one at a time, write down the numerical value of each separate value mentioned in the original problem. Separate the values with plus signs.


When you complete this step, you should be left with the expanded form of the number.

Example: seven-thousand nine-hundred forty-three and two-tenths

Separate each place value: seven-thousand / nine-hundred / forty / three / two-tenths
Write each place value in numerical form:
Seven-thousand: 7000
Nine-hundred: 900
Forty: 40
Three: 3
Two-tenths: 0.2
Combine all of the numerical values into the expanded form of the number: 7000 + 900 + 40 + 3 + 0.2



, Convert the newly written expanded form into standard form by adding all of the separate place values together.



Example: 7000 + 900 + 40 + 3 + 0.2 = 7943.2

, At this point, the original number should now be in its standard form. This will be the final answer of the problem.



Example: The standard form of the original number is: 7943.2

Look at the number.,
Move the decimal point.,
Count the spaces.,
Write your final answer.",How to Write Numbers in Standard Form3," While it is not always true, most numbers needing to be written in British standard form are either very large or very small. The number should also already be in numerical value.


Note that this form is only referred to as ""standard form"" by speakers of British English. In the United States, this numerical form is usually referred to as ""scientific notation.""
The overall purpose of this numerical form is to change very large or very small numbers into an abbreviated, easy-to-write format. You can technically change any number with more than one digit into British standard form regardless of its size, however.

Example A: Write the following value in standard form: 8230000000000

Example B: Write the following value in standard form: 0.0000000000000046

, Shift the decimal point to the right or left, as needed, until it lies directly after the very first digit of the overall number.


Make sure that you pay attention to the original position of the decimal point as you do this. You will need to know that information for the next step.

Example A: 8230000000000 => 8.23

Even though there was no visible decimal point at the end of the original number, there is an implied decimal point at the end of every whole number.



Example B: 0.0000000000000046 => 4.6

, Look at both versions of the number and count the number of spaces you shifted the decimal point over. This number will become the index of your final answer.


The “index” is an exponent tagged onto the multiplier of your final answer.
When you shift the decimal point to the left, the index will be positive. When you shift the decimal point to the right, the index will be negative.

Example A: The decimal was shifted 12 places to the left, so your index will be 12.

Example B: The decimal was shifted 15 places to the right, so your index will be -15.

, Include both the altered form and indexed multiplier when writing the final answer in standard form.


The multiplier will always be 10 for numbers written in British standard form or scientific notation. The index you calculated will always be placed to the right of the 10 in your final answer.

Example A: The standard form of the original value is: 8.23 * 1012


Example B: The standard form of the original value is: 4.6 * 10-15

Look at the problem.,
Separate the real number.,
Take the square root of the integer value.,
Write the imaginary number part.,
Write you final answer.",How to Write Numbers in Standard Form4," The problem should include at least two numerical values. One value will be a real integer and the other value will be a negative number beneath a radical (square root symbol).


Keep in mind that two negative numbers will produce a positive value when multiplied, just as two positive numbers will produce a positive value when multiplied. Due to this fact, any number squared by itself will produce a positive value, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. As such, there is no way in “real” terms for the number beneath a square root radical to be negative since that number should, supposedly, be produced by the square of a smaller value. When an impossible negative value like this occurs, you must deal with it in terms of imaginary numbers.

Example: Write the standard form of the following number: √(-64) + 27

, The real number should be placed at the front of your final answer.



Example: The real number portion of this value is 27 since this is the only portion that does not lie beneath the radical in your original problem.

, Look at the number beneath the radical. Even though you cannot take the actual square root of a negative value, you should at least be able to find what the square root of the numerical value would be if it were positive instead of negative. Find that value now and write it down.



Example: The number beneath the radical is -64. If the integer were positive instead of negative, the square root of 64 would be 8.

Written another way, you could say:
√(-64) = √= √(64) * √(-1) = 8 * √(-1)



, Combine the value you just calculated with the imaginary number indicator, i. When written as a whole, these two pieces make up the imaginary number part of the standard form.



Example: √(-64) = 8i

The i is another way to write: √(-1)
When you consider that √(-64) = 8 * √(-1), you can see that it becomes 8 * i or 8i.



, You should have all the information you need at this point. Write the real number part first and the imaginary number part second. Separate the two with a plus sign.



Example: The standard form of the original number is: 27 + 8i

Use the unknown new amount method for the following sorts of problems: ""A $25 pair of jeans is on sale at 60% off.,
Decide if you have an increase or decrease situation.,
If you have an increase situation, add your percent to 100.,
If you have a decrease situation, subtract your percent from 100.,
Convert the answer to Step 3 or Step 4 into a decimal.,
Multiply this decimal with your original amount.,
Label the increase or decrease appropriately and you're done.,
Practice on the following examples.",How to Work With Percentages of Increase and Decrease2," What is the sale price?"" or ""A colony of 4,800 bacteria grows by 20%. How many bacteria are there now?""

, Something like a sales tax, for example, is an increase situation. A discount, on the other hand, is a decrease situation.

, So an 8% sales tax becomes 108%, for example, or a 12% surcharge becomes 112%.

, If something is 30% off, you will be working with 70%; if something is discounted 12%, you'll be dealing with 88%.

, This means moving the decimal point over two places to the left.


For example, 67% becomes 0.67; 125% becomes 1.25; 108% becomes 1.08; etc.
If you are unsure of how to do this calculation, you can also divide your percentage by 100. This will give you the same number.

, If, for example, we're working on the problem ""A $25 pair of jeans is on sale at 60% off. What is the sale price?"" the following is an illustration of this step:


25 x .40 = ?
Remember that we subtracted our sale price of 60% from 100, giving us 40%, and then turned it into a decimal.

, For our own example, we last had:


25. x .40 = ? Multiply the two numbers together and we get '10'.
But '10' what? 10 dollars, so we say that the new jeans cost $10 after the 60% sale.

, To better understand this type of problem, read the prompt and see if you understand how to finish the following problems:


Problem #1: ""A $120 pair of jeans is on sale at 65% off. What is the sale price?""

To solve: 100 - 65 gives 35%; 35% converts to 0.35.
0.35 x 120 equals 42; the new price is $42 (and quite a deal it is, too!)


Problem #2: ""A colony of 4,800 bacteria grows by 20%. How many bacteria are there now?""

To solve: 100 + 20 gives 120%; that converts to 1.2.
1.2 x 4,800 equals 5,760; there are now 5,760 bacteria in the colony.

Use the unknown original amount method for the following sorts of problems: ""A video game is on sale at 75% off.,
Decide if it's an increase or decrease situation.,
If it's an increase, add the percentage to 100.,
Convert that number into a decimal.,
Divide the ""after amount"" by the decimal from step 3.,
Our ""after amount"" is $15, and our decimal is 0.25.,
Label appropriately and you're done.,
Practice on the following examples.",How to Work With Percentages of Increase and Decrease3," The sale price is $15. What was the original price?"" or ""An investment grew by 22% and is now worth $1525. How much was invested originally?""


To solve these questions, you must understand that percentages are applied using multiplication. Whether it is an increase or decrease, it was applied using multiplication. Your job, therefore, is to undo that multiplication. You are not undoing the increase or decrease; you are undoing the application of the percentage. Therefore, three things will be true:

You will be dividing by the percent.
If you have an increase, you will still add the percentage to 100.
If you have a decrease, you will still subtract the percentage from 100.



, Sales tax, for example, is an increase; discounts are a decrease. An investment that grows in value is an increase; a population that declines in numbers is a decrease and so forth.


Let's imagine we have to work out the following problem: ""A video is on sale at 75% off. The sale price is $15. What is the original price?""

Sale is another word for discount, so we're dealing with a decrease.
$15 is our ""after amount,"" because it's the number we have after the sale has been applied.

, If it's a decrease, subtract the percentage from 100.


Because we're dealing with a decrease/discount, we'll subtract 100 - 75, giving us 25%.

, Do this by moving the decimal point two places to the left or dividing the number by 100.


25% becomes 0.25.

, This will help us reverse the multiplication that we talked about in Step 1.

,


Grab a calculator, punch in '15,' hit divide, enter in '0.25,' and hit equals.

, You've just calculated the original price.


15 divided by 0.25 = 60, which means the original price was $60.
If you want to double-check your answer to make sure it's correct, multiply the sale price (75%, or 0.75) with the original price ($60) and see if you get the sale price.
($15): 0.75 x 60 = $45 sale; $60 (original price) - $45 (sale amount) = $15 (sale price)



, To better understand this type of problem, read the prompt and see if you understand how to finish the following problem: ""An investment grew by 22% and is now worth $1,525. How much was invested originally?""


This is an increase situation, so add 100 + 22.
Convert the answer to a decimal: 122% becomes 1.22
On a calculator, enter '1,525', hit divide, enter '1.22', hit equals.
Label the answer. For this problem, 1,525 divided by 1.22 = 1250, so the original investment was $1,250.

"
"
Decide which of the other numbers is the ""whole amount"" and which is the ""partial amount"".,
Use the equation % = (partial)/(whole).,
This will give you a decimal, which you convert into a percentage by moving the decimal point two places to the right.",How to Work With Percentages1," For example, a problem that says ""8 is what percent of 32?"" indicates that the 32 is the whole amount and the 8 is the partial. What tips this off: the 8 connects directly to the ""is"", while the 32 connects directly to the ""of"".;
, So on the calculator, punch in the partial amount, hit divide, enter the whole, and hit equals.

,

Example: ""8 is what percent of 32?"". Take 8, divide by 32, hit equals; get 0.25; convert that to 25%.






Example: ""what percent of 25 is 16?"". Enter 16, divide by 25, hit equals; get 0.64; convert to 64%.






Example: ""what percent of 12 is 45?"". Enter 45, divide by 12, hit equals; get 3.75; convert to 375%. (Answers larger than 100%, while rare, are acceptable).






Example: ""9 is what percent of 250?"". Enter 9, divide by 250, hit equals; get 0.036; convert to 3.6%.

Triangle ABC is an acute angled triangle. Squares are constructed on each of the three sides AB, BC and AC. Further, a perpendicular is dropped from the vertex A which intercepts the opposite side BC at point D;
,
We need to prove that the square constructed on any side (say AB) is smaller than the other two squares taken together by twice the rectangle contained by either of the other two sides (say BC) and the intercept (CD) between the acute angle and the foot of the perpendicular on it from the opposite angle (A). This can be done if we prove that the area of the square constructed on side AB equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides minus twice the area of the rectangle which can be formed by BC and CD.

Let's assume you have an ""unknown entire amount"" problem, like ""15 is 25% of what number?"".,
Use the equation: (whole amt) = (partial) / %.

,
Using your calculator, enter the partial amount, hit divide, enter the percentage decimal, and hit equals.",How to Work With Percentages2," ""Is"" tends to be associated with the partial amount, while ""of"" is paired with the entire amount. The word ""what"" indicates the unknown.

Example: A question says, ""what is 10% of 16?"" The phrase ""what is"" indicates that the partial amount is unknown. The phrase ""of 16"" indicates that 16 is the whole amount. This is an ""unknown partial amount"" problem.






Example: A question says, ""15 is 25% of what number?"" The phrase ""of what"" means that the entire amount is unknown, but the phrase ""15 is"" shows that 15 is the partial amount. This would be an ""unknown entire amount"" problem.







, First of all, change the percent into a decimal --- 0.25 instead of 25%, 1.38 instead of 138%, 0.07 instead of 7%, etc.

, Taking then a+b-b=ab-b and simplifying the left while factoring b out on the right, leaves a =  b(a-1). Dividing both sides by (a-1) and simplifying leaves a/(a-1) =b, Since ab = c, it's also true that a^2/(a-1) = c. Because a could have been subtracted first instead of b, and because addition and multiplication are both commutative, it's also true that b/(b-1) = a and b^2/(b-1) = c as well.

Check to see if your set is bounded from below.,
Determine whether your set has a supremum.,
Determine whether your set has an infimum.,

Note the upper and lower bounds of your set.",How to Work Out Upper and Lower Bounds," If a set of real numbers, labeled S, includes a real number A ∈ R such that every number of the subset S is less than or equal to A, then S is said to be “bounded from above.” A is an upper bound. Mathematically, this is expressed as follows:
∀x∈S⇒x≤A.
If S does not have an upper bound, it is said to be “unbounded from above.”


If there is a least member among the upper bounds of the set S, then this number is called the “least upper bound” or the “supremum” of the set and is denoted by supS.
If a set S has at least one upper bound, then there are infinitely many upper bounds greater than that number.;
, If a set of real numbers, labeled S, includes a real number B ∈ R such that every number of the subset S is great than or equal to B, then S is said to be “bounded from below.” B is a lower bound. Mathematically, this is expressed as follows:
∀x∈S ⇒x≥B
If S does not have a lower bound, it is said to be “unbounded from below.”


If there is a greatest member among the lower bounds of the set S, then this member is called the “greatest lower bound” or “infimum” of the set and is denoted by infS.
If a set S has at least one lower bound, then there are infinitely many lower bounds less than that number.

, If for a set of real numbers, S, ∃A∈R such that ∀x∈S ⇒x≤A, then A is said to be an upper bound of S. In other words, if there is a real number A so that any number picked from the set of numbers is less than or equal to it, the set is indeed bounded from above.


For example, say you have the follow set of real numbers, S: {1, -1/4, 1/9, 1/16 . . .}. In this example, there is a real number A that is equal to 1, and any number from the set will be less than or equal to it. Therefore, the set is bounded from above.

, If for a set of real numbers, S, ∃B∈R such that ∀x∈S⇒x≥B, then B is said to be a lower bound of S. In other words, if there is a real number B so that any number picked from the set of numbers is greater than or equal to it, the set is indeed bounded from below.


In the example above, there is a real number B that is equal to -1/4, and any number from the set will be greater than or equal to it. Therefore, the set is bounded from below.

, If there is a lowest number among the upper bounds of the set, then this number is the supremum, denoted supS.


In the example above, any number greater than 1 would be an upper bound, but 1 is the lowest upper bound. Therefore, 1 is your supremum: supS = 1.

, If there is a greatest number among the lower bounds of the set, then this number is the infimum, denoted infS.


In the example above, any number less than -1/4 would be a lower bound, but -1/4 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, -1/4 is your infimum: infS = -1/4.

, A number a is the greatest member of a set S if a∈S⋀x∈S⇒x≤a. In other words, if you pick a number from the set, and any number compared to that number is less than or equal to it, that number is the greatest member of the set. It is also called the “maximum.”


In the example above, there is indeed a number a such that these conditions exist. That number is 1, and 1 is therefore the greatest member of your set.

, A number b is the least member of a set S if b∈S⋀x∈S⇒x≥b. In other words, if you pick a number from the set, and any number compared to that number is greater than or equal to it, that number is the lowest member of the set. It is also called the “minimum.”


In the example above, there is indeed a number b such that these conditions exist. That number is -1/4, and -1/4 is therefore the lowest member of your set.

, The biggest and smallest numbers in your set are the upper and lower bounds.


In the example above, you have a set that is both bounded from above and bounded from below, by 1 and -1/4.

Download Visual Studio 2013.,
Click on download.,
Create an empty project.,
Plan your program.,
Include header.,
Write your main function int main ().,
Declare data type.,
Find parameters: To calculate mean, you will need following parameters:

The sum of all the inputs that will be entered by user and
Total number of inputs provided by user.,
Create a loop: Using for loop ask the user to enter numbers that will be calculated.,
Calculate the mean.,
Review your final code.,
Display the result.",How to Write a C++ Program to Calculate Mean," You can download the software from the Visual Studio website

, The specific software version that you requested will start downloading on clicking.

, After installing Visual Studio, select new project and follow the steps to create an empty project. Now you can start writing the code in compiler.

, The first step to make this program is to plan how the program will work. If the numbers that will be calculated are long, then double data type can be used to save numbers.

Double data type will help to keep decimal point if needed, whereas int data type will disregard digits after decimal.

, The first line of code will start with include<iostream> following the namespace statement. This two line enable program to input numbers and output result as well.

, Function is a method that includes different statements that will be executed to find the output of the program.


At the end of the main function, you need to include the return statement that is return 0. This line will help to stop your program. Inside your main function, write your detailed code.

, In the main function declare variables that will be used for calculation.


Variable data will be used to know total number of inputs and i will be used for keep track of for loop. Also declare sum, average and array of sized 100.
This array numcan hold up to 100 numbers to calculate mean.

, Using for loop, ask the user to enter numbers that will be calculated.
For example, if the sum of the inputs = 50, and the total number of inputs = 10, the mean = 50 / 10 = 5
So, the formula to calculate the mean, or the average, is: Mean = Sum of all inputs / Total Number of inputs.

, You can also use a while loop.


Adding one with i, will count the entered number from 1 instead of 0
To find sum of all inputs, add numbers while user enter each number.

, Using formula and code given in previous step, get all the information from the user, and then calculate average or mean using the formula. Average = sum / data;

, It will look something like this:





#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main(){
 
        int data, i;
        double num, sum = 0.0, average;
        cout << ""Enter total numbers of data: "";
        cin >> data;
 
        for (i = 0; i<data; i++)
        {
                cout << i + 1 << "". Enter number: "";
                cin >> num;
                sum = sum + num;
        }
        average = sum / data;
        cout << ""Average/Mean = "" << average<<endl;
        return 0;
}





, Once the program has calculated the average or mean, display it to the user. Use cout statement to output the calculated result.

Write down the implied fraction with a small space in between, so that unit you have already used can become the denominator of the fraction.,
Multiply the fractions.",How to Use Dimensional Analysis to Solve a Conversion Equation (High School Level),";
, Find out what unit you need to convert to, and what unit you have to work with to find that final answered unit.

, Jot it down on your paper.

, This step is crucial.

, Sometimes it's easy to decipher in the problem, sometimes it's not and needs to be found someplace (or could even be a multi-step problem). Example: If you are given centimeters and are asked to convert it to inches and you have the given fraction, you've got enough information to solve. If not (such as if you are given inches and need to convert to millimeters through a unit of centimeters), you'll need to do a little more work.

,, The units will later cancel, leaving you the unit you'll eventually need to solve for as part of the numerator.


Sometimes, they'll make it easy and the numerator will become a quantity of 1, but that's up to the problems discretion and each problem is different.

, Understand that there could be an implied 1 (with no unit attached) with a unit of below the initial quantity you need to convert from.

Select column B and Format Cells Number for 14 decimal places. Expand the column width if need be.





, In this example, it is 685.





, In cell A2, type ""InitialROOTGuess"" (w/o the quotation marks). Since 25^2 = 625, and 30^2 = 900, we will use 25. Please input 25 in cell B2

, Doing so will assign the defined variable name ""Square"" to cell B1, as well as the defined variable name ""InitialROOTGuess"" to cell B2.


The Newton-Raphson method is that guess X(1) (read X sub 1) = X(0) + f(X(0))/f'(X(0)). In this case, where x^2 = 685, f(x) = x^2 - 685 = 0 and f'(x) = 2x. Therefore, into cell B3, please input the following formula (w/o quotation marks) ""=InitialROOTGuess-((InitialROOTGuess^2-Square)/(2*InitialROOTGuess))""

, The formula will be taking each previous guess and using it to get a better current answer by a factor of 2 more significant digits each computation.


You should see the correct answer, 26.1725046566048, which is the square root of 685, in cell B6. Please notice how fast the Newton-Raphson method arrived at the correct answer.

, For simple expressions such as 4x^3, to obtain the derivative, one takes the exponent down and multiplies it as a (combined) coefficient, and reduces the exponent by 1 power, so the derivative of x^n = nx^(n-1) and the derivative of 4x^3 = 12x^2. If there is a constant such as π in the expression as a factor, that is treated as the 4 just was above in 4x^3 -- it remains. If there is a lone x, such as in the expression 4x^3 - x, the derivative of that is 12x^2 - 1, since x^0 = 1. if there is a constant added such as 4x^3 + 10, it is dropped, and the derivative is 12x^2.

,, In the new cell A1, type ""Power"" (w/o quotation marks). Format cell C1 with a border and red font and input 10 into cell C1.

, when Power = 10. Therefore, we have (a+10) = a^10, so F(X) = a^10 - a - 10 and F'(x) = 10*a^9 - 1. Our InitialROOTGuess will be 1 since 1+10 = 11 and 1^10 = 1, but 2+10 = 12 and 2^10 = 1024 (which is much too large). We do not know the ""square"", which is actually a^10 -- not a square -- or sum (a+b) yet. Do not input an InitialROOTGuess yet however. Let's preserve the square root function we made in columns A and B by moving over and working in column C.





, Select cell C1 and Insert Name Define Powerful for it. You may type ""Powerful"" into B1 if you so choose. Select cell C3 and input the following formula (w/o quotes): ""=InitialGuess+(((InitialGuess)^Powerful)-Powerful-InitialGuess)/(Powerful*(-InitialGuess)^(Powerful-1)"". The evaluated result should equal 2. This has modified the derivative in the denominator somewhat by dropping the constant; in this case, that is necessary, along with changing the sign of the InitialGuess in the final term. Call it the Garthwaite method if you please -- it is part of trying to arrive at the base instead of the root.

,,


An InitialGuess of -1 will result in the answer -1.24233531640777 and that is also correct in that (-1.24233531640777 + 10) = -1.24233531640777^10 = 8.75766468359223

Understand the concept of Roman numerals.,
Learn the values.,
Put them together.,
Learn the special rules for 4000 and above.,
Understand how to break up a number to read it.",How to Use Roman Numerals," Roman numerals use fewer symbols than the number system you are used to. I is the number 1 (one), V is 5 (five), and X is 10 (ten), for example. Counting starts out as easy as I (one), II (two), III (three). But for the next one, write IV for ""one away from five"" (I away from V), which is four. This pattern continues with V (five), VI (five + one = six), VII (seven), VIII (eight), then IX (""one away from ten"" = nine), X (ten). This may sound confusing, but you'll get the hang of it, Take a look at Roman numerals from 1 to 20:
I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV XVI XVII XVIII XIX XX;
, As you may know, the Roman numbering system is based on letters rather than a whole new alphabet for numbers.


I 1
V 5
X 10
L 50
C 100
D 500
M 1000

, The concept in step 1 is actually quite basic. That pattern repeats continuously throughout the system, no matter how great a number may be. For example:


From 40 to 50:
XL XLI XLII XLIII XLIV XLV XLVI XLVIII XLIX L
From 100 to 110:
C CI CII CIII CIV CV CVI CVII CVIII CIX CX
By hundreds, from 100 to 1000:
C CC CCC CD D DC DCC DCCC CM M

, There is no character representing 5000, so there are 3 ways to do this.


The Romans themselves just wrote MMMM for 4000.
To be faster, write the Roman numeral value for 4 in parentheses like so: (IV)
Finally, a bar could be drawn above the number rather than putting the number in parentheses.

, After understanding how the individual numbers are written, it is easy to understand how MCMXXXIV (used as an example in the introduction) means 1934. To get MCMXXXIV, simply add: MCM (1900) + XXX (30) + IV (4). To get MDCCLXXVI (1776), simply add: MDCC (1700) + LXX (70) + VI (6).

Multiply the term outside of the parentheses by each term in the parentheses.,
Combine like terms.,
Solve the equation.",How to Use Distributive Property to Solve an Equation1," To do this, you are essentially distributing the outer term into the inner terms. Multiply the term outside the parentheses by the first term in the parentheses. Then multiply it by the second term. If there are more than two terms, keep distributing the term until there are no terms left. Keep whatever operation (plus or minus) is in the parentheses.2(x−3)=10{\displaystyle 2(x-3)=10}


2(x)−(2)(3)=10{\displaystyle 2(x)-(2)(3)=10}


2x−6=10{\displaystyle 2x-6=10}
;
, Before you can solve the equation, you will have to combine like terms. Combine all numerical terms with each other. Separately, combine any variable terms. To simplify the equation, arrange the terms so the variables are on one side of the equals sign and the constants (numbers only) are on the other.2x−6=10{\displaystyle 2x-6=10}…..(original problem)


2x−6(+6)=10(+6){\displaystyle 2x-6(+6)=10(+6)}….. (Add 6 to both sides)


2x=16{\displaystyle 2x=16}….. (Variable on left; constant on right)


, Solve for x{\displaystyle x} by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient in front of the variable.2x=16{\displaystyle 2x=16}…..(original problem)


2x/2=16/2{\displaystyle 2x/2=16/2}…..(divide both sides by 2)

Distribute a negative number together with its negative sign.,
Combine like terms.,
Divide to find the final solution.,
Treat subtraction as adding (-1).",How to Use Distributive Property to Solve an Equation2," If you have a negative number multiplying a term or terms within parentheses, be sure to distribute the negative to each term inside the parentheses.Remember the basic rules of multiplying negatives:

Neg. x Neg. = Pos.

Neg. x Pos. = Neg.



Consider the following example:


−4(9−3x)=48{\displaystyle -4(9-3x)=48}….. (original problem)


−4(9)−(−4)(3x)=48{\displaystyle -4(9)-(-4)(3x)=48}…..(distribute (-4) to each term)


−36−(−12x)=48{\displaystyle -36-(-12x)=48}…..(simplify the multiplication)


−36+12x=48{\displaystyle -36+12x=48}…..(notice that ‘minus -12’ becomes +12)




, After you complete the distribution, you then need to simplify the equation by moving all the variable terms to one side of the equals sign, and all the numbers without variables to the other. Do this by a combination of addition or subtraction.−36+12x=48{\displaystyle -36+12x=48}…..(original problem)


−36(+36)+12x=48+36{\displaystyle -36(+36)+12x=48+36}…..(add 36 to each side)


12x=84{\displaystyle 12x=84}…..(simplify the addition to isolate the variable)


, Solve the equation by dividing both sides of the equation by whatever the coefficient of the variable is. This should result in a single variable on one side of the equation, with the result on the other.12x=84{\displaystyle 12x=84}…..(original problem)


12x/12=84/12{\displaystyle 12x/12=84/12}…..(divide both sides by 12)


x=7{\displaystyle x=7}…..(solution)


, Whenever you see a minus sign in an algebra problem, particularly if it comes before a parenthesis, you should imagine that it says + (-1). This will help you correctly distribute the negative to all the terms within the parentheses. Then solve the problem as before.For example, consider the problem, 4x−(x+2)=4{\displaystyle 4x-(x+2)=4}. To be certain that you distribute the negative properly, rewrite the problem to read:


4x+(−1)(x+2)=4{\displaystyle 4x+(-1)(x+2)=4}



Then distribute the (-1) to the terms inside the parentheses as follows:


4x+(−1)(x+2)=4{\displaystyle 4x+(-1)(x+2)=4}…..(revised problem)


4x−x−2=4{\displaystyle 4x-x-2=4}…..(multiply (-1) times x and times 2)


3x−2=4{\displaystyle 3x-2=4}…..(combine terms)


3x−2+2=4+2{\displaystyle 3x-2+2=4+2}…..(add 2 to both sides)


3x=6{\displaystyle 3x=6}…..(simplify terms)


3x/3=6/3{\displaystyle 3x/3=6/3}…..(divide both sides by 3)


x=2{\displaystyle x=2}…..(solution)

Identify any fractional coefficients or constants.,
Find the lowest common multiple (LCM) for all denominators.,
Multiply all terms of the equation by the LCM.,
Combine like terms.,
Solve the equation.",How to Use Distributive Property to Solve an Equation3," Sometimes, you may have a problem that contains fractions as coefficients or constants. You are allowed to leave them as they are and apply the basic rules of algebra to solve the problem. However, using the distributive property can often simplify the solution by turning the fractions into integers.Consider the example x−3=x3+16{\displaystyle x-3={\frac {x}{3}}+{\frac {1}{6}}}. The fractions in this problem are x3{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{3}}} and 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}.


, For this step, you can ignore all the integers. Look only at the fractions, and find the LCM for all the denominators. To find the LCM, you need the smallest number that is evenly divisible by the denominators of the fractions in the equation. In this example, the denominators are 3 and 6, so the LCM is 6., Remember that you can perform any operation that you want to an algebra equation, as long as you do it equally to both sides. Multiply all terms of the equation by the LCM, and the fractions will cancel out and “become” integers. Place parentheses around the entire left and right sides of the equation and then perform the distribution:x−3=x3+16{\displaystyle x-3={\frac {x}{3}}+{\frac {1}{6}}}…..(original equation)


(x−3)=(x3+16){\displaystyle (x-3)=({\frac {x}{3}}+{\frac {1}{6}})}…..(insert parentheses)


6(x−3)=6(x3+16){\displaystyle 6(x-3)=6({\frac {x}{3}}+{\frac {1}{6}})}…..(multiply both sides by LCM)


6x−6(3)=6(x3)+6(16){\displaystyle 6x-6(3)=6({\frac {x}{3}})+6({\frac {1}{6}})}…..(distribute multiplication)


6x−18=2x+1{\displaystyle 6x-18=2x+1}…..(simplify multiplication)


, Combine all of the terms so all the variables appear on one side of the equation, and all constants appear on the other. Use basic operations of addition and subtraction to move terms from one side to the other.6x−18=2x+1{\displaystyle 6x-18=2x+1}…..(simplified problem)


6x−2x−18=2x−2x+1{\displaystyle 6x-2x-18=2x-2x+1}…..(subtract 2x from both sides)


4x−18=1{\displaystyle 4x-18=1}…..(simplify subtraction)


4x−18+18=1+18{\displaystyle 4x-18+18=1+18}…..(add 18 to both sides)


4x=19{\displaystyle 4x=19}…..(simplify addition)


, Find the final solution by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable. This should leave a single x term on one side of the equation, and the numerical solution on the other.4x=19{\displaystyle 4x=19}…..(revised problem)


4x/4=19/4{\displaystyle 4x/4=19/4}…..(divide both sides by 4)


x=194 or 434{\displaystyle x={\frac {19}{4}}{\text{ or }}4{\frac {3}{4}}}…..(final solution)

Interpret a long fraction as distributed division.,
Simplify each numerator as a separate fraction.,
Isolate the variable.,
Divide by the coefficient to solve the problem.,
Avoid the common trap of dividing only one term.,
Check the correctness of your solution.",How to Use Distributive Property to Solve an Equation4," You may occasionally see a problem that contains multiple terms in the numerator of a fraction, over a single denominator. You need to treat this as a distributive problem and apply the denominator to each term of the numerator. You can rewrite the fraction to show the distribution, as follows:


4x+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4x+8}{2}}=4}.....(original problem)


4x2+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{2}}+{\frac {8}{2}}=4}.....(distribute the denominator to each term of the numerator)


, After distributing the denominator to each term, you can then simplify each term individually.


4x2+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{2}}+{\frac {8}{2}}=4}.....(revised problem)


2x+4=4{\displaystyle 2x+4=4}.....(simplify the fractions)


, Proceed to solve the problem by isolating the variable on one side of the equation and moving the constant terms to the other side.  Do this with a combination of addition and subtraction steps, as needed.


2x+4=4{\displaystyle 2x+4=4}.....(revised problem)


2x+4−4=4−4{\displaystyle 2x+4-4=4-4}.....(subtract 4 from both sides)


2x=0{\displaystyle 2x=0}.....(isolated x on one side)


, In the final step, divide by the coefficient of the variable. This should lead you to the final solution, with the single variable on one side of the equation and the numerical solution on the other.


2x=0{\displaystyle 2x=0}.....(revised problem)


2x/2=0/2{\displaystyle 2x/2=0/2}.....(divide both sides by 2)


x=0{\displaystyle x=0}.....(solution)


, It is tempting (but incorrect) to divide the first numerator term by the denominator and cancel out the fraction. A mistake like this, for the problem above, would look like the following:


4x+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4x+8}{2}}=4}.....(original problem)


2x+8=4{\displaystyle 2x+8=4}.....(divide only 4x by 2 instead of the full numerator)


2x+8−8=4−8{\displaystyle 2x+8-8=4-8}


2x=−4{\displaystyle 2x=-4}


x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2}..... (incorrect solution)


, You can always check your work by inserting your solution into the original problem. When you simplify, you should reach a true statement. If you simplify and get an incorrect statement, then your solution was incorrect. For this example, test the two solutions of x=0 and x=-2 to see which is correct.

Begin with the solution x=0:


4x+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4x+8}{2}}=4}.....(original problem)


4(0)+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4(0)+8}{2}}=4}.....(insert 0 for x)


0+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {0+8}{2}}=4}


82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{2}}=4}


4=4{\displaystyle 4=4}.....(true statement. This is the correct solution.)



Try the ""false"" solution of x=-2:


4x+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4x+8}{2}}=4}.....(original problem)


4(−2)+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4(-2)+8}{2}}=4}.....(insert -2 for x)


−8+82=4{\displaystyle {\frac {-8+8}{2}}=4}


02=4{\displaystyle {\frac {0}{2}}=4}


0=4{\displaystyle 0=4}.....(incorrect statement. Therefore, x=-2 is false.)

,  In addition to preprocessor directives, the first lines of the code must also define the namespace being used.  The standard namespace, formatted as shown below, is sufficient for this code.  Note that this line ends with a semicolon.

,  To create the main function, type “int main()” as shown below.  The parentheses are for setting the parameters of the function, but here no parameters are needed and thus the parentheses are empty.  There is no semicolon after the function definition.

,  On the next line, make a set of curly braces as shown in the graphic.  Everything included within these curly brackets is part of the main function.  The code up to this point should look something like the picture below.

,  Cout is used with the insertion operator, which is written as << (two “less than” signs).  The actual output then follows, written within quotation marks.  The line must end with a semicolon.

,  Within the main function, type the cout statement using the proper syntax.  For example:   cout << “type text here”;

,  Cout can also be used to output the values of variables, as long the variable has already been defined.  Simply write the name of the variable after the insertion operator as shown below.

,  Insertion operators can be simply chained together, one after the other as shown in the figure.

,  Cin is used with the extraction operator, which is written as >> (two “greater than” signs).  The operator is then followed by a variable where the inputted data is stored.  The line must end with a semicolon.

,  First declare a variable. Then write a cin statement to define a value for the variable as shown.  When the program runs, the input that user enters will be assigned to the variable.  Note that the cin statement does not output any text onto the monitor.

Record the quotient.,
Determine the remainder.,
Repeat the process.",How to Use an Abacus," Each column in the top row should have one or two beads per row, while each column in the bottom row should have four. When you start, all of the beads should be up in the top row, and down in the bottom row. The beads in the top row represent the number value 5 and each bead in the bottom row represents the number value 1., As on a modern calculator, each column of beads represents a ""place"" value from which you build a numeral. So, the farthest column on the right would be the ""ones"" place (1-9), the second farthest the ""tens"" place (10-99), the third farthest the hundreds (100-999), and so on.You can also assign some columns to be decimal places if necessary.

, To count a digit, push one bead to the ""up"" position. ""One"" would be represented by pushing a single bead from the bottom row in the farthest column on the right to the ""up"" position, ""two"" by pushing two, etc.You'll find it easiest to use your thumb to move the beads in the top row, and your index finger to move the beads in the bottom row.

, The abacus at this position is correctly read ""five."" To count ""six,"" push one bead from the bottom row up, so the bead in the top row is down (representing a value of 5) and one bead from the bottom row is up., The process is essentially the same across the abacus. Go from ""nine,"" in which all the beads in the ones place are pushed up and the bead in the top row is pushed down, to ""ten,"" in which a single bead from the bottom row of the tens place is pushed up.

For example, 11 would have one bead in the second column pushed up, and another in the first column pushed up, all on the bottom row. 12 would have one in the second column and two in the first column, all pushed up, and all on the bottom row.
226 would have two in the third column pushed up in the bottom row, and two in the second column pushed up in the bottom row. In the first column, one bead on the bottom row would be pushed up, and one bead on the top row would be pushed down.

, Say you've got to add 1234 and 5678. Enter 1234 on the abacus by pushing up four beads in the ones place, three in the tens place, two in the hundreds place, and one in the thousands place., The first numbers you'll add are the 1 and the 5 from the thousands place, in this case moving the single bead from the top row of that column down to add the 5, and leaving the lower bead up for a total of 6. Likewise, to add 6 in the hundreds place, move the top bead in the hundreds place down and one bead from the bottom row up to get a total of 8.

, Since adding the two numbers in the tens place will result in 10, you'll carry over a 1 to the hundred place, making it a 9 in that column. Next, put all the beads down in the tens place, leaving it zero.


In the ones column, you'll do essentially the same thing. 8 + 4 = 12, so you'll carry the one over to the tens place, making it 1. This leaves you with 2 in the ones place.

, You're left with a 6 in the thousands column, a 9 in the hundreds, a 1 in the tens, and a 2 in the ones: 1,234 + 5,678 = 6,912.

, Borrow digits from the previous column instead of carrying them over. Say you're subtracting 867 from 932. After entering 932 into the abacus, start subtracting column-by-column starting on your left.


8 from 9 is one, so you'll leave a single bead up in the hundreds place.
In the tens place, you can't subtract 6 from 3, so you'll borrow the 1 in the hundreds place (leaving it zero) and subtract 6 from 13, making it 7 in the tens place (the upper bead up and two lower beads).
Do the same thing in the ones place, ""borrowing"" a bead from the tens place (making it 6) to subtract 7 from 12 instead of 2.
There should be a 5 in the ones column: 932 - 867 = 65.

, Start at the farthest left column of the abacus. Say you're multiplying 34 and 12. You need to assign columns to ""3"", ""4"", ""X"", ""1"", ""2"", and ""="". Leave the rest of the columns to the right open for your product.The “X” and “=” will be represented by blank columns.
The abacus should have 3 beads up in the farthest column left, four up in the next farthest, a blank column, a column with one bead up, two beads up in the next, and another blank column. The rest of the columns are open.

, The order here is critical. You need to multiply the first column by the first column after the break, then the first column by the second column after the break. Next, you'll multiply the second column before the break by the first column after the break, then the second column before the break by the second column after the break.If you are multiplying larger numbers, keep the same pattern: start with the leftmost digits, and work to the right.

, Start recording in the first answer column, after the blank one for the “=” sign. You will keep moving beads on the right hand portion of the abacus as you multiply the individual digits. For the problem 34 x 12:First, multiply 3 and 1, recording their product in the first answer column. Push three beads up in that seventh column.
Next, multiply the 3 and the 2, recording their product in the eighth column. Push up the upper bead and one lower bead in that column.
When you multiply the 4 and the 1, add that product (4) to the eighth column, the second of the answer columns. Since you're adding a 4 to a 6 in that column, carry one bead over to the first answer column, making a 4 in the seventh column and a zero in the eighth.
Record the product of the last two digits 4 and 2 (8), in the last of the answer columns. They should now read 4, blank, and 8, making your answer 408.

, When dividing on an abacus, you will put the divisor in the left-most column(s). Put the dividend in the columns just to the right of this. The next columns to the right will be used for the answer. Leave those blank for now.For example, to divide 34 by 2, count 2 in the left-most column, and 34 over to the right. Leave the other columns blank.

, Divide the first number in the dividend (3) by the divisor (2), and put it in the first blank column on the right. 2 goes into 3 once, so record a 1 there.

, Next, you need to multiply the quotient in the first answer column (1) by the dividend in column one (2) to determine the remainder. This product (2) needs to be subtracted from the first column of the dividend. The dividend should now read 14.

, Record the next digit of the quotient in the next blank column, subtracting the product from the divisor (here, eliminating it). Your board should now read 2, then 1, 7, showing your divisor and the quotient, 17.

Instead, the numbers are spaced using a special ""logarithmic"" formula, closer together on one side than the other. This lets you line up the scales to get the answer to multiplication problems, as described below.;
, Each scale on the slide rule should have a letter or symbol identifying it, printed to the left or right. This guide will assume your slide rule uses the most common notation:The C and D scales each look like a single stretched out ruler, reading from left to right. These are called ""single decade"" scales.
The A and B scales are ""double decade"" scales. Each one has two smaller stretched rulers stacked end-to-end.
The K scale is a triple decade scale, or three stretched rulers stacked end-to-end. Not all models have this.
The C| and D| scales are the same as the C and D scales, but read right to left. These are often printed in red. Not all models have these.

, Take a look at the vertical lines of the C or D scale, and get used to reading them:


The primary numbers on the scale begin with 1 on the extreme left edge, extend up to 9, then end with another 1 on the far right edge. These are usually all labeled.
The secondary divisions, marked by the second-tallest vertical lines, divide each primary number by 0.1. Don't be confused if these are labeled ""1, 2, 3;"" remember they actually represent ""1.1, 1.2, 1.3"" and so on.
There are usually smaller divisions, typically representing increments of 0.02. Pay close attention, since these may disappear on the high end of the scale, where numbers get closer together.

, You'll often have to make a ""best guess"" when reading a scale, when the answer doesn't fall exactly on a line. Slide rules are used for quick calculations, not for purposes that require extreme precision.


For instance, if the answer falls between the 6.51 and 6.52 marks, write down whichever value it's closer to. If you can't tell, write 6.515.

, Write down the two numbers you plan to multiply together.


In Example 1 throughout this section, we'll calculate 260 x 0.3.
In Example 2, we'll calculate 410 x 9. This ends up being a little more complicated than Example 1, so you might want to follow Example 1 first.

, The slide rule is only labeled with numbers between 1 and 10. Move the decimal point in each number you are multiplying, so they fall between these values. After the problem is complete, we'll move the decimal point in the answer back to the right place, as described at the end of this section.


Example 1: to calculate 260 x 0.3 on a slide rule, start with 2.6 x 3 instead.
Example 2: to calculate 410 x 9, start with 4.1 x 9 instead.

, Find the smaller number on the D scale. Slide the C scale so the ""1"" on the far left (called the left index) is directly in line with that number.


Example 1: slide the C scale so the left index is in line with the 2.6 on the D scale.
Example 2: slide the C scale so the left index is in line with the 4.1 on the D scale.

, The cursor is the metal object that slides over the entire slide rule. Line the cursor up with the second number in your multiplication problem, on the C scale. The cursor will point to the answer to your problem on the D scale. If it can't slide that far, go to the next step.


Example 1: slide the cursor so it points to 3 on the C scale. At this position it should also point to 7.8 on the D scale, or extremely close to it. Skip ahead to the estimation step.
Example 2: try to slide the cursor so it points to the 9 on the C scale. On most slide rules, this will not be possible, or the cursor will be pointing to empty air off the end of the D scale. See the next step for how to fix this.

, If the cursor is blocked by a ""bridge"" in the center of the slide rule, or if the answer is ""off the scale,"" take a slightly different approach instead.Slide the C scale so the right index, or the 1 on the extreme right end, is located over the larger factor in the multiplication problem. Slide the cursor to the location of the other factor on the C scale, and read the answer on the D scale.


Example 2: slide the C scale so the 1 on the far right lines up with the 9 on the D scale. Slide the cursor to 4.1 on the C scale. The cursor is pointing to the D scale in between 3.68 and 3.7, so the answer must be about 3.69.


, No matter what multiplication you try, your answer will always be read off the D scale, which only displays numbers from one to ten. You'll need to use some estimation and mental math to determine where to put the decimal point in your actual answer.


Example 1: Our original problem was 260 x 0.3, and the slide rule gave us an answer of 7.8. Round the original problem to convenient numbers and solve it in your head: 250 x 0.5 = 125. This is much closer to 78 than it is to 780 or 7.8, so the answer is 78.
Example 2: Our original problem was 410 x 9, and we read an answer of 3.69 on the slide rule. Estimate the original problem as 400 x 10 = 4,000. The closest we can get to that by moving the decimal point is 3,690, so that must be the actual answer.

, These two scales are typically fixed in place. Simply slide the metal cursor to a value on the D scale, and the A value will be its square.Just like a multiplication problem, you'll need to determine the position of the decimal point yourself.


For example, to solve 6.12, slide the cursor to 6.1 on the D scale. The corresponding A value is about 3.75.
Estimate 6.12 to 6 x 6 = 36. Position the decimal point to get an answer near this value: 37.5.
Note that the exact answer is 37.21. The slide rule answer is off by less than 1%, easily accurate enough for most real-world circumstances.

, You've just seen how the A scale, which is a D scale shrunk to 1/2 scale, lets you find the square of numbers. Similarly, the K scale, which is a D scale shrunk to 1/3 scale, lets you find the cubes. Simply slide the cursor to a D value and read the result on the K scale. Use estimation to place the decimal.


For example, to solve 1303, slide the cursor to 1.3 on the D value. The corresponding K value is 2.2. Since 1003 = 1 x 106, and 2003 = 8 x 106, we know the answer must be somewhere between them. The answer must be 2.2 x 106, or 2,200,000.

, As always, the slide rule only has values from 1 to 10, so you'll need to write the number in scientific notation before you can find its square root.


Example 3: to solve √(390), write it as √(3.9 x 102).
Example 4: to solve √(7100), write it as √(7.1 x 103).

, To find the square root of a number, the first step is sliding the cursor to that number on the A scale. However, since the A scale is printed twice, you'll have to decide which one to use first.To do so, follow these rules:


If the exponent in your scientific notation is even (such as 2 in Example 3), use the left side of the A scale (the ""first decade"").
If the exponent in your scientific notation is odd, (such as 3 in Example 4), use the right side of the A scale (the ""second decade"").

, Ignoring the exponent of ten for now, slide the metal cursor along the A scale to the number you've ended up with.


Example 3: To find √(3.9 x 102), slide the cursor to 3.9 on the left A scale. (Use the left scale because the exponent is even, as described above.)
Example 4: To find √(7.1 x 103), slide the cursor to 7.1 on the right A scale. (Use the right scale because the exponent is odd.)

, Read the D value where the cursor is pointing. Add ""x10n"" to this value. To calculate n, take the original power of 10, round down to the nearest even number, and divide by 2.


Example 3: The corresponding D value at A=3.9 is about 1.975. The original number in scientific notation had 102. 2 is already even, so just divide by 2 to get 1. The final answer is 1.975 x 101 = 19.75.
Example 4: The corresponding D value at A=7.1 is about 8.45. The original number in scientific notation had 103, so round the 3 down to the nearest even number, 2, then divide by 2 to get 1. The final answer is 8.45 x 101 = 84.5.

, The process for finding cube roots is very similar. The most important step is determining which of the three K scales to use. To do this, divide the number of digits in your number by three and find the remainder. If the remainder is 1, use the first scale. If 2, use the second scale. If 3, use the third scale. (Another way to accomplish this is to repeatedly count from the first scale to the third, until you reach the number of digits in your answer.)Example 5: To find the cube root of 74,000, first count the number of digits (5), divide by 3 and find the remainder (1 remainder 2). Since the remainder is 2, use the second scale. (Alternatively, count the scales five times: 1–2–3–1–2.)
Slide the cursor to 7.4 on the second K scale. The corresponding D value is approximately 4.2.
Since 103 is smaller than 74,000, but 1003 is larger than 74,000, the answer must be in between 10 and 100. Move the decimal point to make 42.

Note that the first two numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence are same: 1 and 1.;
,
Any other number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the two immediately preceding numbers.,
In a different situation, say you need to write a particular number of terms in the Fibonacci Sequence.",How to Understand the Fibonacci Sequence,", It's that simple!
Few examples:

The 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 3rd and 2nd numbers.
i.e. 3 = 2 + 1






The 7th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 6th and 5th numbers.
i.e. 13 = 8 + 5






The 11th number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the 10th and 9th numbers.
i.e. 89 = 55 + 34







, For example, consider generating first 6 terms of the Fibonacci Sequence. The steps are as follows:

Write the first two terms -> 1, 1






Generate the 3rd term by adding the 2nd and 1st terms
i.e. 3rd term = 1 + 1 = 2






Generate the 4th term by adding the 3rd and 2nd terms
i.e. 4th term = 2 + 1 = 3






Generate the 5th term by adding the 4th and 3rd terms
i.e. 5th term = 3 + 2 = 5






Generate the 6th term by adding the 5th and 4th terms
i.e. 6th term = 5 + 3 = 8

Since probability is expressed as a ratio, or fraction, you can think of it as being the odds that something will happen, on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 being no chance, and 1 being certain (that is, the event will happen 1 out of 1 times).Probability describes random events. A random event is an event that cannot be predicted,for example, pulling a particular card out of a deck, or getting struck by lightning.
;
, The probability of something happening is defined by the ratio probability=numberoffavorableoutcomesnumberofpossibleoutcomes{\displaystyle probability={\frac {number\;of\;favorable\;outcomes}{number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}}}, where a favorable outcome is the event you are seeking to happen., To do this, complete the probability ratio by determining how many favorable outcomes you can have, and how many possible outcomes you can have.

Before you can understand more complex probability theory, you must understand how to figure out the probability of a single, random event happening, and understand what that probability means.

For example, if you have a jar with 10 red marbles and 5 blue marbles, you might want to know what the possibility of randomly pulling out a blue marble is. Since you have 5 blue marbles, the number of favorable outcomes is 5. Since you have 15 marbles total in your jar, the number of possible outcomes is 15. Your probability ratio will look like this:probability=numberoffavorableoutcomesnumberofpossibleoutcomes{\displaystyle probability={\frac {number\;of\;favorable\;outcomes}{number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}}}probability=515{\displaystyle probability={\frac {5}{15}}} Simplified, probability=13{\displaystyle probability={\frac {1}{3}}}. So, the probability of randomly pulling out a blue marble is 1 out of 3.


, Independent events are ones in which the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other event happening.For example, if you are using two dice, you might want to know what the probability is that you will roll a double 3. The chance that you will throw a 3 with one die does not affect the chance that you will throw a 3 with the second die, thus the events are independent.


, To do this, set up the ratio probability=numberoffavorableoutcomesnumberofpossibleoutcomes{\displaystyle probability={\frac {number\;of\;favorable\;outcomes}{number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}}}, where a favorable outcome is the event you are seeking to happen.

For example, if the first event is throwing a 3 with one die, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, since there is only one 3 on a die. The number of possible outcomes is 6, since a die has six sides. So, your ratio will look like this: probability=16{\displaystyle probability={\frac {1}{6}}}. 


, To do this, set up the ratio, just like you did for the first event.

For example, if the second event is also throwing a 3 with one die, the probability is the same as the first event: probability=16{\displaystyle probability={\frac {1}{6}}}.

The probability of the first and second event might not be the same. For example, if you and a classmate own the same outfit, you might want to know the probability that she and you will wear the same outfit to school on the same day. If you have five outfits, the odds of you wearing the outfit is 15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5}}}, but if your classmate has ten outfits, the odds of her wearing the outfit is 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}}.


, This will give you the probability of both events happening.For a refresher on how to multiply fractions, read Multiply Fractions.

For example, if the probability of throwing a 3 with one die is 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, and the probability of throwing a 3 with a second die is also 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, to find the probability of both events happening, you would calculate 16×16=136{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}\times {\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {1}{36}}}. So, the probability of throwing double threes is 1 out of 36.


, A conditional event, also called a dependent event, is an event that may be affected by the event(s) that come before.For example, if you are drawing from a standard deck of cards, you might want to know what the probability is of drawing a heart on the first and second draws. Drawing a heart the first time affects the probability of it happening again, because once you draw one heart, there are fewer hearts in the deck, and fewer cards in the deck.


, To do this, set up the ratio probability=numberoffavorableoutcomesnumberofpossibleoutcomes{\displaystyle probability={\frac {number\;of\;favorable\;outcomes}{number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}}}, where a favorable outcome is the event you are seeking to happen.

For example, if the first event is drawing a heart from a deck of cards, the number of favorable outcomes is 13, since there are 13 hearts in a deck. The number of possible outcomes is 52, since a deck has 52 cards total. So, your ratio will look like this: probability=1352{\displaystyle probability={\frac {13}{52}}}. Simplified, the probability is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}.


,

For example, if you pulled a heart on your first draw, now there are only 12 hearts in the deck, and there are only 51 cards total. So, the probability of drawing a heart on your second draw is 1251{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{51}}}. Simplified, the probability is 417{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{17}}}.


, This will give you the probability of both events happening.For a refresher on how to multiply fractions, read Multiply Fractions.

For example, if the probability of pulling a heart on your first draw is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, and the probability of pulling a heart on your second draw, given that you pulled a heart on your first draw, is 417{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{17}}}, to find the probability of both events happening, you would calculate:14×417=468{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}\times {\frac {4}{17}}={\frac {4}{68}}}468=117{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{68}}={\frac {1}{17}}}So, the probability of pulling hearts on your first and second draw is 1 out of 17.  


, Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time.Mutually exclusive events will be marked by the conjunction or. (Events that are not mutually exclusive will use the conjunction and.)For example, if you are rolling one die, you might want to know the probability of rolling a 3 or a 4. You cannot roll a 3 and a 4 with one die, so the events are mutually exclusive.


, To do this, set up the ratio probability=numberoffavorableoutcomesnumberofpossibleoutcomes{\displaystyle probability={\frac {number\;of\;favorable\;outcomes}{number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}}}, where a favorable outcome is the event you are seeking to happen.

For example, if the first event is throwing a 3 with one die, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, since there is only one 3 on a die. The number of possible outcomes is 6, since a die has six sides. So, your ratio will look like this: probability=16{\displaystyle probability={\frac {1}{6}}}.


, To do this, set up the ratio, just like you did for the first event.

For example, if the second event is throwing a 4 with one die, the probability is the same as the first event: probability=16{\displaystyle probability={\frac {1}{6}}}.

The probability of the first and second event might not be the same. For example, you might want to know the probability of the next random song in a 32-song playlist being hip hop or folk. If there are 12 hip hop songs in the playlist, and 6 folk songs, the probability of the next song being hip hop is 1232{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{32}}}, and the probability of it being folks is 632{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{32}}}.


, This will give you the probability of either event happening.

For a refresher on how to add fractions, read Add Fractions.

For example, if the probability of throwing a 3 with one die is 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, and the probability of throwing a 4 with one die is also 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, to find the probability of both events happening, you would calculate:16+16=26{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}+{\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {2}{6}}}26=13{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}={\frac {1}{3}}}So, the probability of throwing a 3 or a 4 is 1 out of 3.

Set up this equation: T1 - T2 = T1/ T2
Proceed to subtract Theory #1 from both sides: T1-T1 - T2 = T1/T2 - T1
Simplify the left and factor out T1 on the right: -T2 = T1(1/T2 - 1)
Divide both sides by (1/T2 - 1): -T2/(1/T2 - 1) = T1*(1/T2 - 1)/(1/T2 - 1) = T1
Put in the expected number of adherents or facts that represent T2: Let's say 100, because it could also represent 100%.
Substituting in 100 for T2, you should get -100/(1/100 - 1) = T1
Work out the math and get first -100/(-99/100) = T1
Work that by flipping the denominator and multiplying by it, to get -100(-100/99) = T1.
Arrive at the answer that 101.01010101 ... = T1. Better than 100%, in a way ...
Put back the numbers for T1 and T2 in the original equation to make sure it is correct: Originally, T1 - T2 = T1/ T2, so you get 101.0101 - 100 = 101.0101/100.
Solve the problem. Make sure the left side equals 1.01010101... and the right side, given you have a calculator or computer handy, you should get 1.01010101... also on the right! They're equal, the left and right sides of the equation. That is, the difference between the two theories is small, just 1.01010101 ..., and their ratio T1/T2 is also very close to Unity. Which means that these two theories are stating almost the same truth!!! There's a slight difference, yes, an advantage to T1 if being larger is advantageous (it's not, always).
Notice T1 is 101.01010101...% correct. Why? Because he's checked all those decimal 1 tiny possibilities is why!! He's forever testing against smaller and smaller problems and bothersome facts, because the number repeats forever!
You can further solve problems and you can use any number, except 1. The reason you cannot use 1, is because the equation has a step, -T2/(1/T2 - 1) = T1, where if T2=1, you get 0 in the denominator, which is undefined, or infinite, depending upon your own theory about division by zero. Let it be that the slope y/x of the x axis = the tangent of 0º (i.e. when y=0) = 0. Call that m1. And the slope of 90º, that is when y goes up forever in value and x approaches 0 infinitely closer and closer = Infinity or Undefined. Call that slope m2. Now recall your algebra and Cartesian Graph and remember that perpendicular lines, like the axes of x and y, must have their slopes multiply to equal -1. And since you can't multiply anything by ""Undefined"", and Infinity is not strictly speaking a number on the number line (depending on whose theory you believe), then the best we might say is that m1*m2=-1, so 0*INFINITY = -1, else those two axes are not perfectly perpendicular.
Learn that, in that case, -T2/(1/T2 - 1) = T1 become -1/0 = Infinity, which is exactly what the Cartesian Plane submits is the fact. And happily, not only is Theory #1 correct in terms of tiny details, but it's also infinitely correct! Everywhere in Space-Time on at least 1 plane, of infinitely many such planes, it is correct.
Make sure that your theory matters. Because we're all made up of very small particles, whizzing while spinning, and spinning while their whizzing, around. That's what matters, and don't let anyone tell you different.

, It works just fine with 100, even if 100 does not really mean 100%, 1.01010101 ... is extremely close to 100%. In Accounting, and Auditing, in most circumstances, for an account to be off by 3-5% with a 99% Confidence Level, makes for an immaterial discrepancy, and the firm will still have a pass on their audit, though there may be some specifics about the discrepancy way far down in the Notes to the Financial Statements, which nowadays are as important to read as the statements themselves, if you're thinking of investing that is, or divesting, as the case may be., Make your theory useful, because it matters.,

Let T+B-B = TB-B
Let T = B*(T-1), where the 1 stands for something 100% Beautiful.
Let T/(T-1) = B, by dividing both sides by (T-1), and simplifying. We now have Beauty isolated and defined in terms of Truth and 1.
Let T= any number except 1, else Beauty is Infinite, with no room left for Truth?
Let T = 12, like 12 jurors in a trial. Then, substitute 12 for T and get:
Let 12/(12-1) = B. And 12/11 = 1.09090909....
Test the original hypothesis: T+B = T*B = Omniscience (at least for 12 jurors, that is, the triers of fact.
Find out if 12+ 12/11 = 12* 12/11?
Proceed to find out that 132/11+ 12/11 = 144/11, which = 13.09090909.... or 12 and 12/11. In this case, the Jury is so beautiful in their relative omniscience, that they, by setting the sum of Truth and Beauty equal to the product of Truth and Beauty, have added a fact worth 12/11 to the Truth (=12). That's why people say ""Facts are beautiful things"".

, ""That's a rather beautiful theory you've got there"" is what you'd like to hear, of course! Who wouldn't?  ;), Just add in the proper measure, test it, taste it, feel that it's right and good when it's there and when it's gone, and you will have developed the proper way(s) to theorize, about most anything you care to acquire the facts about., As mentioned before, check them all out before you just start off willy-nilly, okay? It's alright if some people call you ""ridiculous"" -- it just means you've planted your flag on the Moon, when everyone said it couldn't be done! And it matters, it matters a great deal, things like that., Therefore, one might as well have started out by subtracting Truth, instead of Beauty. In that case, it works out that B/(B-1) = T, just as T/(T-1) = B, because of Commutation. It's very symmetrical, which is a hot topic now in Higher Math. It also means that T^2/(T-1) = B^2/(B-1) = Omniscience, but the two 1's mean something different in each case. With the T's, the 1 was a B before, and with B^2/(B-1), the 1 was Truth previously, when they were factored. Their graphs being entirely similar, they are two lines or curves occupying the same course in the plane, simultaneously. They're twins, as it were, or a very strong Devotee and Master. See it with your two eyes and hear it with your two ears, males and females, for 'tis Truth, and Beautiful. Above is a picture of some ""schizopairs"" in a ""rare state of attraction"" like a + b, or T*B, in an image created via Neutral Operations in Excel:
, Listen carefully, because like String Theory, which is a very Strong Theory of vibrational consonance and harmony, this theory deals with extremely minute quantities. It's called the ""Base 1 Theory"" and like the base 2, it has two members, 0 and 1, but the 0's are all arbitrary and being arbitrary, are not exactly a defined number; the number of zeroes is both not important and very important, if you understand such paradoxes, because 0.00000000000000... is arbitrarily as close to a definition of 0 as one could want. In a way, this is both the Base 1 and the Base 0 theory, combined -- it practically doesn't count at all, except that it's an approximation (or direct statement and definition) of the smallest entity in the Cosmos, as theorized by humans. If 1/3 = .333333333...., then 3/3 = either 1 or .99999999999999.... The base 1 is simply the 1 that allows a person to convert the discrepancy between .999999999999... and 1 into an equality, and is simply 1^-n power, as n approaches Infinity. That is, by adding .01 or .0000000000000000001, somewhere arbitrarily in all those 9's, 1 is created, depending upon how large or tiny one needs the 1 to be. That's why it's the nth power in the formula. If one asks, ""but what about all the 9's to the right of where one puts 1^-n? They are infinitely close to 0, so they are of practically no consequence. It is just what is needed to solve all those ""rounding errors"" and discrepancies that are arbitrary in math today. That's the theory anyway ... the theory of the arbitrary 1, Base 1. It's arguable, of course, but may be just the trick Science needs to decide where they will cut off inquiry at its tiniest, for now ... it's right next to the proposal to have commas to the right of the decimal point too, like this: .00,000,000,000,000,..n. It matters very little, or quite a lot, as a teaching aid to students of the minute. I freely admit it's not as convenient as Exponential Notation, but it might help some people grasp how relatively tiny the subject matter is., For example, 1/.999 = 1.001001001001 actually, not 1 exactly. Some of those magnitudes of cyclical 1's would be fantastically large compared to a neutron's size, for example. That is a Cyclical Small Base, which is a little different than a simple Arbitrary Base, and awaits better definition ... because if one takes pi and subtracts or adds all the digits which make it equal 3, or 4, or a number arbitrarily rounded off in pi, so that pi becomes actually useful at tiny distances and amounts, one is really speaking of another arbitrary process which this author believe utilizes the Base 1, or not -- it's arbitrary. One could use this Cyclical Small Base to talk about a possible recurrence or non-recurrence of (some) physical laws at various levels of reality perhaps, because certain physical constants may fail to exist at those levels. As =1/0.9990999 = 1.00090091090991, once can dream up an infinite number of bases to count by, depending on their applicability in the realm concerned, with a given (tiny) Confidence Level, or series of them. Something exists at the practically Infinitely Small, we just have very little confidence assuring anyone that it's known or knowable., Are we talking about the 3 made up of Phi? In that case, we have a situation where we're subtracting the most irrational number from one whose generalized forms of CFE (Continued Fraction Expansion) are very regular, if infinite. It's like finding the CFE for the reciprocal of the largest prime one multiplies by to obtain 1. It's there but increasingly difficult to find I imagine -- I don't know that for a FACT. Perhaps it's easily obtained, due to the process of establishing the largest prime. Maybe not. It's probably had by a fairly simple algorithm in fact. It may be a piece of work that's very piecework. Hypothetically speaking, it may very well be do-able."

Identify the denominator of each ratio.,
Find the least common multiple for the two denominators.,
Write the equivalent fraction for the first ratio.,

Compare the two equivalent fractions.",How to Tell if Two Ratios Are in Proportion1," Ratios can be expressed using a colon (1:2{\displaystyle 1:2}), the word “to” (1 to 2{\displaystyle {\text{1 to 2}}}), or a fraction bar (12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}).Set up your ratios as fractions. The denominator is the number below the fraction bar.

For example, if one shelter’s ratio of cats to dogs is 6 to 4, and another shelter’s ratio of cats to dogs is 39 to 26, you would rewrite the ratios as 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}} and 3926{\displaystyle {\frac {39}{26}}}. So, the denominators are 4{\displaystyle 4} and 26{\displaystyle 26}.
;
, To find the least common multiple, look for the smallest multiple each denominator has in common.If there is no least common multiple, then the ratios cannot be in proportion and no further steps are required.

For example, the denominators 4 and 26 are both multiples of 52.


, To find the equivalent fraction, divide the least common multiple by the denominator. Multiply the numerator by this quotient. This will give you the new numerator of your equivalent fraction.

For example, if the first ratio is 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}}, you would divide the least common multiple (52) by 4:52÷4=13{\displaystyle 52\div 4=13}.So, you will multiply the numerator (6) by 13:6×13=78{\displaystyle 6\times 13=78}.So, your new fraction becomes 7852{\displaystyle {\frac {78}{52}}}.


, Follow the same steps you did to find the equivalent fraction for the first ratio.

For example, if the second ratio is 3926{\displaystyle {\frac {39}{26}}}, you would divide the least common multiple (52) by 26:52÷26=2{\displaystyle 52\div 26=2}.So, you will multiply the numerator (39) by 2:39×2=78{\displaystyle 39\times 2=78}.So, your new fraction becomes 7852{\displaystyle {\frac {78}{52}}}.


, If the two fractions are equal, then the two original ratios are in proportion.For example, 7852=7852{\displaystyle {\frac {78}{52}}={\frac {78}{52}}}, so 64=3926{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}={\frac {39}{26}}}

For example, if you are comparing the ratios 6 to 4 and 39 to 26, set them up as follows: 64=3926{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}={\frac {39}{26}}}.


, Place this product to the right of the equation.

For example, 6×26=156{\displaystyle 6\times 26=156}:64=3926156{\displaystyle {\frac {\cancel {6}}{4}}={\frac {39}{\cancel {26}}}156}

, If they are the same, then the ratios are in proportion.For example, since 156=156{\displaystyle 156=156}, you know that 64=3926{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}={\frac {39}{26}}}.

If your ratios are set up this way, turn them into fractions. Use a variable, such as x{\displaystyle x}, to stand for the missing number

For example, if you are baking cookies, and you need 6 cups of flour for every 4 batches of cookies, how many cups of flour do you need to make 20 batches of cookies? The first ratio is 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}}. The second ratio is x20{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{20}}}, since you are trying to find out how many cups of flour you need to make 20 batches of cookies. So your proportion will be set up like this: 64=x20{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}={\frac {x}{20}}}.


, Place this product to the right of the equation.

For example, 6×20=120{\displaystyle 6\times 20=120}:64=x20120{\displaystyle {\frac {\cancel {6}}{4}}={\frac {x}{\cancel {20}}}120}


, Place this product to the left of the equation.

For example, 4×x=4x{\displaystyle 4\times x=4x}:4x64=x20120{\displaystyle 4x{\frac {\cancel {6}}{\cancel {4}}}={\frac {\cancel {x}}{\cancel {20}}}120}


, This will give you the missing number in your second ratio. The two ratios are now in proportion.For example:4x=120{\displaystyle 4x=120}4x4=1204{\displaystyle {\frac {4x}{4}}={\frac {120}{4}}}x=30{\displaystyle x=30}.So, if you need 6 cups of flour for 4 batches of cookies, you will need 30 cups of flour for 20 batches of cookies. Thus, 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}} and 3020{\displaystyle {\frac {30}{20}}} are ratios in proportion.

Review opposite variables.,
Replace each variable in the function with its opposite.,
Simplify the new function.,
Compare the two functions.",How to Tell if a Function Is Even or Odd1," In algebra, the opposite of a variable is written as a negative. This is true whether the variable in the function is x{\displaystyle x} or anything else. If the variable in the original function already appears as a negative (or a subtraction), then its opposite will be a positive (or addition). The following are examples of some variables and their opposites:the opposite of x{\displaystyle x} is −x{\displaystyle -x}

the opposite of q{\displaystyle q} is −q{\displaystyle -q}

the opposite of −w{\displaystyle -w} is w{\displaystyle w}.
;
, Do not alter the original function other than the sign of the variable. For example:f(x)=4x2−7{\displaystyle f(x)=4x^{2}-7} becomes f(−x)=4(−x)2−7{\displaystyle f(-x)=4(-x)^{2}-7}


g(x)=5x5−2x{\displaystyle g(x)=5x^{5}-2x} becomes g(−x)=5(−x)5−2(−x){\displaystyle g(-x)=5(-x)^{5}-2(-x)}


h(x)=7x2+5x+3{\displaystyle h(x)=7x^{2}+5x+3} becomes h(−x)=7(−x)2+5(−x)+3{\displaystyle h(-x)=7(-x)^{2}+5(-x)+3}.


, At this stage, you are not concerned with solving the function for any particular numerical value. You simply want to simplify the variables to compare the new function, f(-x), with the original function, f(x). Remember the basic rules of exponents which say that a negative base raised to an even power will be positive, while a negative base raised to an odd power will be negative.f(−x)=4(−x)2−7{\displaystyle f(-x)=4(-x)^{2}-7}


f(−x)=4x2−7{\displaystyle f(-x)=4x^{2}-7}




g(−x)=5(−x)5−2(−x){\displaystyle g(-x)=5(-x)^{5}-2(-x)}


g(−x)=5(−x5)+2x{\displaystyle g(-x)=5(-x^{5})+2x}


g(−x)=−5x5+2x{\displaystyle g(-x)=-5x^{5}+2x}




h(−x)=7(−x)2+5(−x)+3{\displaystyle h(-x)=7(-x)^{2}+5(-x)+3}


h(−x)=7x2−5x+3{\displaystyle h(-x)=7x^{2}-5x+3}




, For each example that you are testing, compare the simplified version of f(-x) with the original f(x). Line up the terms with each other for easy comparison, and compare the signs of all terms.If the two results are the same, then f(x)=f(-x), and the original function is even. An example is:


f(x)=4x2−7{\displaystyle f(x)=4x^{2}-7} and f(−x)=4x2−7{\displaystyle f(-x)=4x^{2}-7}.

These two are the same, so the function is even.



If each term in the new version of the function is the opposite of the corresponding term of the original, then f(x)=-f(-x), and the function is odd. For example:


g(x)=5x5−2x{\displaystyle g(x)=5x^{5}-2x} but g(−x)=−5x5+2x{\displaystyle g(-x)=-5x^{5}+2x}.

Notice that if you multiply each term of the first function by -1, you will create the second function. Thus, the original function g(x) is odd.



If the new function does not meet either of these two examples, then it is neither even nor odd. For example:


h(x)=7x2+5x+3{\displaystyle h(x)=7x^{2}+5x+3} but h(−x)=7x2−5x+3{\displaystyle h(-x)=7x^{2}-5x+3}. The first term is the same in each function, but the second term is an opposite. Therefore, this function is neither even nor odd.

Start with any matrix.,
Turn the first row of the matrix into the first column of its transpose.,
Repeat for the remaining rows.,
Practice on a non-square matrix.,
Express the transposition mathematically.,
(MT)T = M. The transpose of a transpose is the original matrix.This is pretty intuitive, since all you're doing is switching the rows and columns.,
Flip square matrices over the main diagonal.,
Transpose a symmetric matrix.,
Start with a complex matrix.,
Take the complex conjugate.,
Transpose the results.",How to Transpose a Matrix," You can transpose any matrix, regardless of how many rows and columns it has. Square matrices, with an equal number of rows and columns, are most commonly transposed, so we'll use a simple square matrix as an example:matrix A =
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9;
, Rewrite row one of the matrix as a column:


transpose of matrix A = AT

first column of AT:
1
2
3

, The second row of the original matrix becomes the second column of its transpose. Repeat this pattern until you have turned every row into a column:



AT =
1  4  7
2  5  8
3  6  9

, The transposition is exactly the same for a non-square matrix. You rewrite the first row as the first column, the second row as the second column, and so forth. Here's an example with color-coding to show you where the elements end up:


matrix Z =4  7  2  13  9  8  6

matrix ZT =4  37  92  81  6


, The concept is pretty simple, but it's good to be able to describe it in mathematics. No jargon is required beyond basic matrix notation:


If matrix B is an m x n matrix (m rows and n columns), the transposed matrix BT is an n x m matrix (n rows and m columns).For each element bxy (xth row, yth column) in B, the matrix BT has an equal element at byx (yth row, xth column).

, If you switch them again, you're back where you started.

, In a square matrix, transposition ""flips"" the matrix over the main diagonal. In other words, the elements in a diagonal line from element a11 to the bottom right corner will remain the same. Each other elements will move across the diagonal and end up at the same distance from the diagonal, on the opposite side.


If you can't visualize this, draw a 4x4 matrix on a piece of paper. Now fold is over the main diagonal. See how elements a14 and a41 touch? They trade places in the transpose, as does each other pair that touches when folded.

, A symmetric matrix is symmetric across the main diagonal. If we use the ""flip"" or ""fold"" description above, we can immediately see that nothing changes. All the element pairs that trade places were already identical.In fact, this is the standard way to define a symmetric matrix. If matrix A = AT, then matrix A is symmetric.

, Complex matrices have elements with a real and imaginary component. While you can take an ordinary transpose of these matrices, most practical calculations involve the conjugate transpose instead.Matrix C =
2+i     3-2i
0+i     5+0i


, The complex conjugate changes the sign of the imaginary components, without altering the real components. Perform this operation for all elements of the matrix.


complex conjugate of C =
2-i     3+2i
0-i     5-0i


, Take an ordinary transposition of the result. The matrix you end up with is the conjugate transpose of the original matrix.


conjugate transpose of C = CH =
2-i        0-i
3+2i     5-0i

Graph the function.,
Test for symmetry across the y-axis.,
Test for origin symmetry.,
Look for no symmetry.",How to Tell if a Function Is Even or Odd2," Using graph paper or a graphing calculator, draw the graph of the function. Choose several numerical values for x{\displaystyle x} and insert them into the function to calculate the resulting y{\displaystyle y} value. Plot these points on the graph and, after you have plotted several points, connect them to see the graph of the function.When plotting points, check positive and corresponding negative values for x{\displaystyle x}. For example, if working with the function f(x)=2x2+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+1}, plot the following values: 


f(1)=2(1)2+1=2+1=3{\displaystyle f(1)=2(1)^{2}+1=2+1=3}. This gives the point (1,3){\displaystyle (1,3)}.


f(2)=2(2)2+1=2(4)+1=8+1=9{\displaystyle f(2)=2(2)^{2}+1=2(4)+1=8+1=9}. This gives the point (2,9){\displaystyle (2,9)}.


f(−1)=2(−1)2+1=2+1=3{\displaystyle f(-1)=2(-1)^{2}+1=2+1=3}. This gives the point (−1,3){\displaystyle (-1,3)}.


f(−2)=2(−2)2+1=2(4)+1=8+1=9{\displaystyle f(-2)=2(-2)^{2}+1=2(4)+1=8+1=9}. This gives the point (−2,9){\displaystyle (-2,9)}.




, When looking at a function, symmetry suggests a mirror image. If you see that the part of the graph on the right (positive) side of the y-axis matches the part of the graph on the left (negative) side of the y-axis, then the graph is symmetrical across the y-axis. If a function is symmetrical across the y-axis, then the function is even.You can test symmetry by selecting individual points. If the y-value for any selected x is the same as the y-value for -x, then the function is even. The points that were chosen above for plotting f(x)=2x2+1{\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}+1} gave the following results:

(1,3) and (-1,3)

(2,9) and (-2,9).



The matching y-values for x=1 and x=-1 and for x=2 and x=-2 indicate that this is an even function. For a true test, selecting two points is not enough proof, but it is a good indication.


, The origin is the central point (0,0). Origin symmetry means that a positive result for a chosen x-value will correspond to a negative result for -x, and vice versa. Odd functions display origin symmetry.If you select some sample values for x and their opposite corresponding -x values, you should get opposite results. Consider the function f(x)=x3+x{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}+x}. This function would provide the following points:


f(1)=13+1=1+1=2{\displaystyle f(1)=1^{3}+1=1+1=2}. The point is (1,2).


f(−1)=(−1)3+(−1)=−1−1=−2{\displaystyle f(-1)=(-1)^{3}+(-1)=-1-1=-2}. The point is (-1,-2).


f(2)=23+2=8+2=10{\displaystyle f(2)=2^{3}+2=8+2=10}. The point is (2,10).


f(−2)=(−2)3+(−2)=−8−2=−10{\displaystyle f(-2)=(-2)^{3}+(-2)=-8-2=-10}. The point is (-2,-10).



Thus, f(x)=-f(-x), and you can conclude that the function is odd.


, The final example is a function that has no symmetry from side to side. If you look at the graph, it will not be a mirror image either across the y-axis or around the origin. Consider the function f(x)=x2+2x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x+1}.Select some values for x and -x, as follows:


f(1)=12+2(1)+1=1+2+1=4{\displaystyle f(1)=1^{2}+2(1)+1=1+2+1=4}. The point to plot is (1,4).


f(−1)=(−1)2+2(−1)+(−1)=1−2−1=−2{\displaystyle f(-1)=(-1)^{2}+2(-1)+(-1)=1-2-1=-2}. The point to plot is (-1,-2).


f(2)=22+2(2)+2=4+4+2=10{\displaystyle f(2)=2^{2}+2(2)+2=4+4+2=10}. The point to plot is (2,10).


f(−2)=(−2)2+2(−2)+(−2)=4−4−2=−2{\displaystyle f(-2)=(-2)^{2}+2(-2)+(-2)=4-4-2=-2}. The point to plot is (2,-2).



These should give you enough points already to note that there is no symmetry. The y-values for opposing pairs of x-values are neither the same nor are they opposites. This function is neither even nor odd.

You may recognize that this function, f(x)=x2+2x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+2x+1}, can be rewritten as f(x)=(x+1)2{\displaystyle f(x)=(x+1)^{2}}. Written in this form, it appears to be an even function because there is only one exponent, and that is an even number. However, this sample illustrates that you cannot determine whether a function is even or odd when it is written in a parenthetical form. You must expand the function into individual terms and then examine the exponents.

Convert the whole number to a fraction.,
Convert to fractions of like denominators.,
Subtract the numerators.,
Convert to a mixed number (optional).",How to Subtract Fractions from Whole Numbers1," To do this, give the whole number a denominator of 1.

Example: 8−45{\displaystyle 8-{\frac {4}{5}}}


=81−45{\displaystyle ={\frac {8}{1}}-{\frac {4}{5}}}
;
, The original fraction's denominator is also the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions. Multiply the top and bottom of the ""whole number fraction"" by this number so the fractions have the same denominator.


81−45{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{1}}-{\frac {4}{5}}}


=8∗51∗5−45{\displaystyle ={\frac {8*5}{1*5}}-{\frac {4}{5}}}


=405−45{\displaystyle ={\frac {40}{5}}-{\frac {4}{5}}}


, Now that the fractions have the same denominators, you can treat the numerators as a normal subtraction problem:


405−45{\displaystyle {\frac {40}{5}}-{\frac {4}{5}}}


=40−45{\displaystyle ={\frac {40-4}{5}}}

= 365{\displaystyle {\frac {36}{5}}}


, If your answer is an improper fraction, you may need to rewrite it as a mixed number:

Example: Rewrite 365{\displaystyle {\frac {36}{5}}} as a mixed number.

How many times does 5 fit evenly into 36? 5 x 7 = 35, so the whole number portion is 7.

What's left over? The whole number portion is equivalent to 355{\displaystyle {\frac {35}{5}}}, so solve 365{\displaystyle {\frac {36}{5}}} - 355{\displaystyle {\frac {35}{5}}} = 15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5}}}

Combine the whole number and fraction: 365{\displaystyle {\frac {36}{5}}} = 715{\displaystyle 7{\frac {1}{5}}}

Convert the 1 into a fraction.,
Multiply to give the fractions like denominators.,
Combine the two fractions.",How to Subtract Fractions from Whole Numbers2," Did you see how the method above converts the whole number into a fraction, then converts back to a mixed number at the end? This method lets you skip some of that so the fraction only involves smaller numbers.
, Skip this step if your fraction is not improper. (An improper fraction has a larger number on top than on bottom.)

Example: 11−43{\displaystyle 11-{\frac {4}{3}}}


=11−113{\displaystyle =11-1{\frac {1}{3}}}


=10−13{\displaystyle =10-{\frac {1}{3}}}


, For example, rewrite 5 as 4 + 1, or rewrite 22 as 21 + 1.


10−13{\displaystyle 10-{\frac {1}{3}}}


=9+1−13{\displaystyle =9+1-{\frac {1}{3}}}


, At this point we're using the method above to solve the part of the problem in the form ""1 - (fraction)"". The other whole number will stay the same for the rest of the problem.


=9+1−13{\displaystyle =9+1-{\frac {1}{3}}}


=9+11−13{\displaystyle =9+{\frac {1}{1}}-{\frac {1}{3}}}


, As described above, multiply the top and bottom of your new fraction so it has the same denominator as the original fraction.


=9+1∗31∗3−13{\displaystyle =9+{\frac {1*3}{1*3}}-{\frac {1}{3}}}


=9+33−13{\displaystyle =9+{\frac {3}{3}}-{\frac {1}{3}}}


, Subtract the numerators to solve the fraction part of the equation.


=9+3−13{\displaystyle =9+{\frac {3-1}{3}}}


=9+23{\displaystyle =9+{\frac {2}{3}}}


=923{\displaystyle =9{\frac {2}{3}}}

Use the divisor 5 as half the divisor of 10.",How to Teach Mental Math," Adding zero to a number does not change its value.

For example, if I have 6 apples, and you have 0 apples, together we have 6 apples:6+0=6{\displaystyle 6+0=6}
;
, The commutative property states that numbers can be added in any order.

For example, 7 apples plus 4 apples is the same as 4 apples plus 7 apples. They both equal 11 apples:7+4=4+7{\displaystyle 7+4=4+7}11=11{\displaystyle 11=11}


, Use the commutative property and start with the larger number, then count up the value of the smaller number.

This strategy works best when one of the addends is less than five.

Students can use their fingers or manipulatives to keep track of how many they count on.

For example, to calculate 7+3{\displaystyle 7+3}, begin with 7 and count on three: “Seven, eight, nine, ten.”


, Use the commutative property to make a ten, then add the remaining number.

For example, to calculate 3+6+7{\displaystyle 3+6+7}, first make a ten by adding 7 and 3, then add 6:3+6+7{\displaystyle 3+6+7}(7+3)+6{\displaystyle (7+3)+6}(10)+6=16{\displaystyle (10)+6=16}


, A double is an addition sentence that adds a number to itself.

Adding a number to itself yields a number twice as big as the original number, so if students know how to multiply by two, they can use multiplication to help them add.

For example, students can memorize doubles up to 10:1+1=2{\displaystyle 1+1=2}2+2=4{\displaystyle 2+2=4}3+3=6{\displaystyle 3+3=6}4+4=8{\displaystyle 4+4=8}5+5=10{\displaystyle 5+5=10}6+6=12{\displaystyle 6+6=12}7+7=14{\displaystyle 7+7=14}8+8=16{\displaystyle 8+8=16}9+9=18{\displaystyle 9+9=18}10+10=100{\displaystyle 10+10=100} 


, A doubles plus one is an addition sentence that would be a double, except one number is one larger than the other. Once students have their doubles memorized, they can simply add 1 to the doubles sum.

For example, if a student knows that 6+6=12{\displaystyle 6+6=12}, they can recognize that 6+7=13{\displaystyle 6+7=13}, because 6+7=6+6+1{\displaystyle 6+7=6+6+1}.


, Students can use skip counting when adding by twos, fives, or tens.

Students should recognize that any even number plus two will equal an even number, and any odd number plus two will equal an odd number.For example, 5+5+5{\displaystyle 5+5+5} is the same as skip counting by fives three times: “Five, ten, fifteen.”


,

For example, to calculate 29+9{\displaystyle 29+9}, calculate:29+10=30{\displaystyle 29+10=30}30−1=29{\displaystyle 30-1=29}


,

For example, to calculate 58+32{\displaystyle 58+32}, you can break up 58 into 50+8{\displaystyle 50+8}, and you can break up 32 into 30+2{\displaystyle 30+2}. Then you can use the commutative property to add compatible numbers first:50+8+30+2{\displaystyle 50+8+30+2}(50+30)+(8+2){\displaystyle (50+30)+(8+2)}80+10=90{\displaystyle 80+10=90}


,

For example, to find 58+32{\displaystyle 58+32}, you could subtract 2 from 30, then add 2 to 58.58+32{\displaystyle 58+32}(58+2)+(32−2){\displaystyle (58+2)+(32-2)}60+30=90{\displaystyle 60+30=90}


, The result will be the answer, or difference.

Students can use their fingers or manipulatives to count on.

For example, to calculate 8−6{\displaystyle 8-6}, start with 6 and see how many you have to count on to get to 8: “Six, seven, eight.” You counted on 2, so 8−6=2{\displaystyle 8-6=2}.


,

When subtracting with pencil and paper you usually start from the ones place. When using the front end strategy, you work beginning from the other direction.

This strategy only works when you do not have to borrow from other place values. You will know that the problem requires no borrowing if, when you line up the place values of each number, all the digits you are subtracting are smaller than the digits you are subtracting from.

For example, to calculate 795−463{\displaystyle 795-463}, you would first subtract the hundreds place, then the tens place, then the ones place:7−4=3{\displaystyle 7-4=3}9−6=3{\displaystyle 9-6=3}5−3=2{\displaystyle 5-3=2}So 795−463=332{\displaystyle 795-463=332}.


,

You can also use this strategy to break up numbers into hundreds and tens, or larger place values, for easier subtraction.

For example, to calculate 42−24{\displaystyle 42-24}, break up 24 into 20 and 4:42−24{\displaystyle 42-24}(42−20)−4{\displaystyle (42-20)-4}(22)−4=18{\displaystyle (22)-4=18}


, A number multiplied by 0 will always equal 0.

For example, 5 apples zero times is zero: 5×0=0{\displaystyle 5\times 0=0}.


, A number multiplied by 1 will always equal the number.

For example, 5 apples 1 time is 5: 5×1=5{\displaystyle 5\times 1=5}.


, The shortcut is that, when multiplying any number by a multiple of ten, simply add the number of zeroes in the multiple to the other number.

For example:27×10=270{\displaystyle 27\times 10=270}27×100=2,700{\displaystyle 27\times 100=2,700}27×1000=27,000{\displaystyle 27\times 1000=27,000}


, The associative property states that you can change the order of groupings you multiply first.

For example, to calculate 27×5×2{\displaystyle 27\times 5\times 2}, multiplying the 5 and 2 first will make a ten, which makes the problem easier:27×5×2{\displaystyle 27\times 5\times 2}27×(5×2){\displaystyle 27\times (5\times 2)}27×(10)=270{\displaystyle 27\times (10)=270}


, To do this, whenever you are multiplying a number by 5, multiply by 10 instead, and then half the product.

For example, to calculate 27×5{\displaystyle 27\times 5}, change the problem to 27×10{\displaystyle 27\times 10}, then divide the answer in half:27×5=12(27×10){\displaystyle 27\times 5={\frac {1}{2}}(27\times 10)}27×5=12(270){\displaystyle 27\times 5={\frac {1}{2}}(270)}27×5=135{\displaystyle 27\times 5=135}


,

For example, to calculate 125×8{\displaystyle 125\times 8}, you can factor 125 as 25×5{\displaystyle 25\times 5} and 8 as 4×2{\displaystyle 4\times 2}. You can then use the commutative and associative property to multiply the factors in any order or combination. Thus:125×8{\displaystyle 125\times 8}(25×5)×(4×2){\displaystyle (25\times 5)\times (4\times 2)}(25×4)×(5×2){\displaystyle (25\times 4)\times (5\times 2)}100×10=1000{\displaystyle 100\times 10=1000}


,

For example, to calculate 8×45{\displaystyle 8\times 45}, you could half the 8 and double the 45:8×45=4×90{\displaystyle 8\times 45=4\times 90}8×45=360{\displaystyle 8\times 45=360}


, To do this, break up the number you are dividing into smaller numbers that can easily be divided by the divisor. Then, sum the quotients.

For example, to calculate 104÷8{\displaystyle 104\div 8}, break up the 104 into 64 and 40:104÷8{\displaystyle 104\div 8}(64+40)÷8{\displaystyle (64+40)\div 8}(64÷8)+(40÷8){\displaystyle (64\div 8)+(40\div 8)}(8)+(5)=13{\displaystyle (8)+(5)=13}


, The shortcut is that, when dividing any number by a multiple of ten, simply subtract the number of zeroes in the multiple from the other number.

For example:27,000÷10=2,700{\displaystyle 27,000\div 10=2,700}27,000÷100=270{\displaystyle 27,000\div 100=270}27,000÷1,000=27{\displaystyle 27,000\div 1,000=27}


, Whenever you are dividing a number by five, you can instead divide the number by ten, then multiply the quotient by 2.

For example, to calculate 1230÷5{\displaystyle 1230\div 5}, instead divide 1230 by ten, then multiply the answer by 2:1230÷5=2(1230÷10){\displaystyle 1230\div 5=2(1230\div 10)}1230÷5=2(123){\displaystyle 1230\div 5=2(123)}1230÷5=246{\displaystyle 1230\div 5=246}

Know what kind of problem you're tackling.",How to Solve Word Problems Requiring Quadratic Equations1," Quadratic equations can be in many forms. In this article, we will use ax2+bx+c=0{\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0} where a≠ 0. You can solve a quadratic equations using the quadratic formula or factoring.  

 For the real life scenarios, factoring method is better. 

 In geometric problems, it is good to use the quadratic formula.

Write down the equation.,
Determine how to isolate the variable.,
Add or subtract the constant from both sides of the equation.,
Check your work.",How to Solve One Step Equations1," It’s easy to solve equations when you understand what they mean. An equation will have a variable (usually x{\displaystyle x}), which represents an unknown value. The equation will also have a constant, which is a number you need to add or subtract from the variable to equal a certain sum or difference.

For example, you might have the equation x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}. The variable representing the unknown number is x{\displaystyle x}. When you subtract 9 from the unknown number, the difference is 5.
;
, To isolate a variable, you need to get it alone on one side of the equation by performing an inverse operation to cancel the constants. Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. So, if the constant is subtracted in the equation, to cancel it you would add.For example, in the equation x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}, 9 is subtracted from the variable, so to isolate the variable you must cancel the 9 by adding it.


, As you manipulate equations to solve them, you must keep both sides balanced. Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side. So, if you need to add a value to isolate the variable, you must also add that same value to the other side of the equation.For example, in the equation x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}, you need to add 9 to the left side to isolate the variable, so you also need to add 9 to the right side of the equation:x−9=5{\displaystyle x-9=5}x−9+9=5+9{\displaystyle x-9+9=5+9}x=14{\displaystyle x=14}.


, To make sure your solution is correct, plug the value of x{\displaystyle x} into the original equation. If the equation is true, your solution is correct.

For example, if you found that x=14{\displaystyle x=14}, substitute 14 for x{\displaystyle x} in the original equation: 14−9=5{\displaystyle 14-9=5}. Since this equation is true, your solution is correct.

Find the missing amounts of each ingredient.",How to Solve Mixture Word Problems," The table will help you approach the problem logically so that you can set up an equation.The rows will represent each ingredient in the mixture, plus the mixture. So, for a mixture of two ingredients, you need three rows. Label the first row for ingredient 1, the second row for ingredient 2, and the third row for the mixture.

For example, you might have a 20% saline solution, and a 15% saline solution. If you need to make 5 liters of an 18% saline solution, how many liters of each solution do you need to combine?

For this problem you would label the three rows “20% solution,” “15% solution,” and “18% Mixture.”
;
, The first column will include values that represent the part of the total mixture or solution each ingredient is. Label the column “Amount” and fill in the cell for each ingredient. If the amount of each ingredient in the final mixture is unknown, use variables to represent these values.For example, if you are mixing saline solutions, you would label the column “Amount.” Since you don’t know how much of the 20% solution is in the final mixture, write the variable x{\displaystyle x} in this cell. Since you also don’t know how much of the 15% solution is in the final mixture, write the variable y{\displaystyle y} in this cell. Since you know that you need 5 liters of the final mixture, in this cell you will write 5.


, If you are completing a problem regarding diluted solutions, such as a saline solution, then this column will represent the percentage of saline in each unit of the ingredient.

For example, you would label the second column “Percent Saline.” Since the first ingredient is 20% saline, in the first row you will write .20. Since the second solution is 15% saline, in the second row you will write .15. Since the final mixture needs to be 18% saline, in the third row you will write .18.


, If you are completing a problem regarding a diluted solution, then this column will represent the amount of the compound each ingredient adds to the total solution. To find the values for this column, multiply the first two values in each row.For example, you need x{\displaystyle x} amount of the first ingredient, which is 20% saline, in the third column the value for this ingredient is .20x{\displaystyle .20x}. Since you need y{\displaystyle y} amount of the second ingredient, which is 15% saline, in the third column the value for this ingredient is .15y{\displaystyle .15y}. For the total mixture, since you need 5 liters, and the salinity will be 18%, the value for the third column is (5)(.18)=.9{\displaystyle (5)(.18)=.9}, which means there is .9{\displaystyle .9} liters of saline in the final mixture.


, Since you need to solve an equation, you should only be working with one variable. To rewrite the second variable, look at the total amount of the final mixture (the first column of your table). The difference between the total amount of the mixture and the first variable is equal to the second variable.For example, since you need 5 liters of the final mixture, and the first ingredient is equal to x{\displaystyle x} liters of that solution, the second ingredient is equal to 5−x{\displaystyle 5-x} liters.


, Each time you see a y{\displaystyle y} in the grid, replace the variable rewritten in terms of the x{\displaystyle x}. Likely this will be in the second row, third column.

For example, if you found that y=5−x{\displaystyle y=5-x}, in the third column of the second ingredient, you need to change .15y{\displaystyle .15y} to .15(5−x){\displaystyle .15(5-x)}.


, This is the total amount of the ingredient in the final mixture. This value will be the first half of your equation.

For example, you know that the final 18% mixture will have .9 liters of saline in it. So the first half of your equation is .9{\displaystyle .9}.


, These are the total amount of the compound each ingredient adds to the mixture. These addends are the second half of the equation.

For example, since the final mixture will derive .20x{\displaystyle .20x} saline from the first ingredient, and .15(5−x){\displaystyle .15(5-x)} saline from the second ingredient, your equation will look like this: .9=.20x+.15(5−x){\displaystyle .9=.20x+.15(5-x)}.


, Use the  regular rules of algebra to isolate the variable. Remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side.

For example, to solve .9=.20x+.15(5−x){\displaystyle .9=.20x+.15(5-x)}: 

First use the distributive property to simplify the value in parentheses:.9=.20x+.75−.15x{\displaystyle .9=.20x+.75-.15x}.

Second, combine the x{\displaystyle x} terms:.9=.05x+.75{\displaystyle .9=.05x+.75}.

Third, subtract .75{\displaystyle .75} from each side:.9−.75=.05x+.75−.75{\displaystyle .9-.75=.05x+.75-.75}.15=.05x{\displaystyle .15=.05x}.

Fourth, divide each side by .05{\displaystyle .05}:.15.05=.05x.05{\displaystyle {\frac {.15}{.05}}={\frac {.05x}{.05}}}3=x{\displaystyle 3=x}So, you need 3 liters of the first ingredient, the 20% saline solution, for your final mixture.




, Remember that in your original table you had two variables, x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y}. To find the value of y{\displaystyle y}, go back to the expression you used to restate y{\displaystyle y} in terms of x{\displaystyle x}. Plug the value of x{\displaystyle x} into this equation and solve.

For example, if you found that y=5−x{\displaystyle y=5-x} and 3=x{\displaystyle 3=x}, plug 3 into the equation and solve:y=5−3{\displaystyle y=5-3}y=2{\displaystyle y=2}


, The variable x{\displaystyle x} will give you the missing value for the first ingredient. The variable y{\displaystyle y} will give you the missing value for the second ingredient.

For example, if you needed to find how many liters of a 20% saline solution and how many liters of a 15% saline solution you need combine to make 5 liters of a 18% solution, then x{\displaystyle x} will tell you how many liters of the first solution you need, and y{\displaystyle y} will tell you how many liters of the second solution you need. So if x=3{\displaystyle x=3} and y=2{\displaystyle y=2}, you need 3 liters of the 20% solution, and 2 liters of the 18% solution.


, They might be food ingredients, or differently priced items, such as tickets.For example, you might be trying to solve the following problem: The student council is selling 100 cups of punch at a school dance. The punch is made from a combination of fruit juice and lemon-lime soda. They want to sell each cup of punch for $1.00. Normally they would sell a cup of fruit juice for $1.15 and a cup of lemon lime soda for $0.75. How many cups of each ingredient should the student council use to make the punch?

In this problem, fruit juice and lemon-lime soda are the two ingredients.


, The first column will be the amount of each ingredient in the final mixture, and the total amount of the mixture. You will likely need to use variables.

For example, since you know the student council plans on making 100 cups of punch, you would write 100 in the third row of the first column. 

For the fruit juice, you would write the variable x{\displaystyle x}, since you don’t know how much fruit juice will be in the final mixture. 

For the lemon-lime soda, you would write 100−x{\displaystyle 100-x}, since the amount will be the difference between the amount of the total mixture and the amount of the other ingredient.


, This will be the unit price of each ingredient in the mixture, and the unit price of the mixture.For example, you know that the punch will be sold for $1.00 per cup, so write a 1 in the second column for the mixture. The fruit juice sells for $1.15 per cup, so write 1.15 in the second column for this ingredient. The soda sells for $0.75 per cup, so write 0.75 in the second column for lemon-lime soda.


, This column will represent the total price of each ingredient in the total mixture, as well as the total price of the mixture. To calculate this, multiply the values in the first and second column for each ingredient.

For example, since 100 cups of punch will be made, and each cup will cost $1.00, the total price of the punch is 100×1=100{\displaystyle 100\times 1=100}.

Since there are x{\displaystyle x} cups of fruit juice in the punch, and fruit juice is priced at $1.15 per cup, the total price of the fruit juice in the mixture is 1.15x{\displaystyle 1.15x}.

Since there are 100−x{\displaystyle 100-x} cups of soda in the punch, and soda is priced at $0.75 per cup, the total price of the soda in the mixture is 0.75(100−x){\displaystyle 0.75(100-x)}. Simplified using the distributive property, this becomes 75−.75x{\displaystyle 75-.75x}.


, To solve for x{\displaystyle x} set up an equation using the third column of the table. The values in the first and second row of the third column will add up to the value in the third row of the third column.

For example, (1.15x)+(75−.75x)=100{\displaystyle (1.15x)+(75-.75x)=100}.


, To do this, isolate the variable using normal algebra rules. Remember to balance the equation by completing calculations to both sides.

For example, to solve for x{\displaystyle x}, you would first combine like x{\displaystyle x} terms, then subtract 75 from both sides of the equation, then divide both sides .4:(1.15x)+(75−.75x)=100{\displaystyle (1.15x)+(75-.75x)=100}(1.15x−.75x)+(75)=100{\displaystyle (1.15x-.75x)+(75)=100}.4x+75=100{\displaystyle .4x+75=100}.4x+75−75=100−75{\displaystyle .4x+75-75=100-75}.4x=25{\displaystyle .4x=25}.4x.4=25.4{\displaystyle {\frac {.4x}{.4}}={\frac {25}{.4}}}x=62.5{\displaystyle x=62.5}


, To do this, plug the value of x{\displaystyle x} into the table, and complete any necessary calculations.

For example, since x=62.5{\displaystyle x=62.5}, the student council should use 62.5 cups of fruit juice in its punch, and 100−62.5{\displaystyle 100-62.5}, or 37.5, cups of lemon-lime soda in the punch.

,

 dm=54{\displaystyle dm=54} (The day times the month equals Miss Pitasi's favorite number, 54.)

,  Only one answer out of two will be realistic (if the problem asks for both the variables, you have to give two answers).

 4m2+6m−54=0{\displaystyle 4m^{2}+6m-54=0} becomes (2m−6)(2m+9){\displaystyle (2m-6)(2m+9)}, resulting 3=m=−4.5{\displaystyle 3=m=-4.5}.

,

 The problem tells us that the base is 9 less than 2 times the height.  You can express this as: b=2h−9{\displaystyle b=2h-9}

Using the quadratic formula −b±b2−4(a)(c)2(a){\displaystyle {\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4(a)(c)}}}{2(a)}}}, h=(−(−9)±−92−4(2)(−24)2(2){\displaystyle h={\frac {(-(-9)\pm {\sqrt {-9^{2}-4(2)(-24)}}}{2(2)}}}, h=9±2734{\displaystyle h={\frac {9\pm {\sqrt {273}}}{4}}}. Since 9−2734{\displaystyle {\frac {9-{\sqrt {273}}}{4}}} gives you a negative number, the answer would be 9+2734{\displaystyle {\frac {9+{\sqrt {273}}}{4}}} which is approximately 6.38cm.

Understand that subtraction of percentages may be done in several ways: You can convert the percent to a fraction or decimal.",How to Subtract Percentages in Math1," While you might need to subtract a percent from a percent when working in finance, if you are working on homework you more likely will come across problems where you need to subtract a percent from a whole number. 

Three of the methods and examples below each have an elegant/straight forward alternative technique that cuts away the complexity of awkward conversions that are optional.

Evaluate the equation.,
Determine how to isolate the variable.,
Multiply or divide from both sides of the equation.,
Check your solution.",How to Solve One Step Equations2," The variable, usually x{\displaystyle x}, represents an unknown value. Solving an equation means finding the unknown value. The equation may also have a coefficient, which is a number you need to multiply by the variable to equal a certain product. The variable may also be the numerator of a fraction. This means you need to divide the variable by the number in the denominator to equal a certain quotient.

For example, you might have the equation 3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}. The variable representing the unknown number is x{\displaystyle x}. When you multiply the unknown number and 3, the product is 24.


, Isolating a variable means getting it by itself on one side of the equation. To do this you must perform an inverse operation to cancel coefficients or fractions. Multiplication and division are inverse operations. If the variable has a coefficient, to cancel it you would divide by the coefficient, since any number divided by itself is equal to 1. If the variable is the numerator of a fraction, to isolate it you would multiply by the denominator, since multiplying by a number cancels the division by that number.For example, in the equation 3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24} the variable is multiplied by 3, so to isolate the variable you must cancel the 3 by dividing by 3.


, As you solve an equation the most important thing to remember is that you must keep both sides of the equation balanced. This means that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other side, too.So, if you need to divide by a value to isolate the variable, you must also divide by the same value on the other side of the equation.

For example, in the equation 3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}, you need to divide by 3 on the left side to isolate the variable, so you also need to divide by 3 on the right side of the equation:3x=24{\displaystyle 3x=24}3x3=243{\displaystyle {\frac {3x}{3}}={\frac {24}{3}}}x=8{\displaystyle x=8}


, To make sure your answer is correct, plug the value of x{\displaystyle x} into the original equation. If the equation is true, your solution is correct.

For example, if you found that x=8{\displaystyle x=8}, substitute 8 for x{\displaystyle x} in the original equation: 3(8)=24{\displaystyle 3(8)=24}. Since this equation is true, your solution is correct.

Solve this equation with a fraction: x4=8{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{4}}=8}.,
Solve this equation with a negative constant: −16+x=29{\displaystyle -16+x=29}.,
Solve this equation with a negative coefficient: −5x=45{\displaystyle -5x=45}.",How to Solve One Step Equations3,"

Since the variable is divided by 4, to isolate it you need to multiply by 4.


x4=8{\displaystyle {\frac {x}{4}}=8}


4(x4)=(4)8{\displaystyle 4({\frac {x}{4}})=(4)8}


x=32{\displaystyle x=32}

Checking your work, since 324=8{\displaystyle {\frac {32}{4}}=8}, your solution is correct.


,

Since the constant is negative, adding it to both sides will isolate the variable.


−16+x=29{\displaystyle -16+x=29}


−16+x+16=29+16{\displaystyle -16+x+16=29+16}


x=45{\displaystyle x=45}

Checking your work, since −16+45=29{\displaystyle -16+45=29}, your solution is correct.


,

Since the variable is multiplied by -5, to isolate the variable, you must divide each side by -5. Remember that dividing a positive number by a negative number equals a negative quotient.


−5x=45{\displaystyle -5x=45}


−5x−5=45−5{\displaystyle {\frac {-5x}{-5}}={\frac {45}{-5}}}


x=−9{\displaystyle x=-9}

Checking your work, since −5(−9)=45{\displaystyle -5(-9)=45}, your solution is correct.

For example, with variables x, y and z, you would need three equations. If you have four variables, you need four equations.


If you have fewer equations than the number of variables, you will be able to learn some limiting information about the variables (such as x = 3y and y = 2z), but you cannot get a precise solution. For this article, we will be working toward getting a unique solution only.;
, Before you can transfer information from the equations into matrix form, first write each equation in standard form. The standard form for a linear equation is Ax+By+Cz=D, where the capital letters are the coefficients (numbers), and the last number - in this example, D - is on the right side of the equals sign.


If you have more variables, you will just continue the line as long as necessary. For example, if you are trying to solve a system with six variables, your standard form would look like Au+Bv+Cw+Dx+Ey+Fz =G. For this article, we will focus on systems with only three variables. Solving a larger system is exactly the same, but just takes more time and more steps.
Note that in standard form, the operations between the terms is always addition. If your equation has subtraction instead of addition, you will need to work with this later my making your coefficient negative. If it helps you remember, you can rewrite the equation and make the operation addition and the coefficient negative. For example, you can rewrite the equation 3x-2y+4z=1 as 3x+(-2y)+4z=1.

, A matrix is a group of numbers, arranged in a block-looking format, that we will work with to solve the system. It actually carries the same data as the equations themselves, but in a simpler format. To create the matrix from your equations in standard form, just copy the coefficients and result of each equation into a single row, and stack those rows one on top of each other.


For example, suppose you have a system that consists of the three equations 3x+y-z=9, 2x-2y+z=-3, and x+y+z=7. The top row of your matrix will contain the numbers 3,1,-1,9, since these are the coefficients and solution of the first equation. Note that any variable that has no coefficient showing is assumed to have a coefficient of 1. The second row of the matrix will be 2,-2,1,-3, and the third row will be 1,1,1,7.
Be sure to align the x-coefficients in the first column, the y-coefficients in the second, the z-coefficients in the third, and the solution terms in the fourth. When you finish working with the matrix, these columns will be important in writing your solution.

, By convention, a matrix is designated with a pair of square brackets, , around the entire block of numbers. The brackets do not factor into the solution in any way, but they do illustrate that you are working with matrices. A matrix can consist of any number of rows and columns. As we work through this article, we will use brackets around terms in a row to help join them.

, In working with matrices, it is common convention to refer to the rows by the abbreviation R and the columns with the abbreviation C. You can use numbers together with these letters to indicate a specific row or column. For example, to indicate Row 1 of a matrix, you can write R1. Row 2 would be R2.


You can indicate any specific position in a matrix by using a combination of R and C. For example, to pinpoint the term in the second row, third column, you could call it R2C3.

, Before you begin doing any work to solve your system of equations, you should recognize what you will be trying to do with the matrix. Right now, you have a matrix that looks like this:


3 1 -1 9
2 -2 1 -3
1 1 1 7
You will be working with some basic operations to create the “solution matrix.” The solution matrix will look like this:
1 0 0 x
0 1 0 y
0 0 1 z
Notice that the matrix consists of 1’s in a diagonal line with 0’s in all other spaces, except the fourth column. The numbers in the fourth column will be your solution for the variables x, y and z.

, The first tool at your disposal for solving a system using a matrix is scalar multiplication. This is simply a term that means you will be multiplying the items in a row of the matrix by a constant number (not a variable). When you use scalar multiplication, you must remember to multiply every term of the entire row by whatever number you select. If you forget and only multiply the first term, you will ruin the entire solution. You are not required, however, to multiply the entire matrix at the same time. You are only working on one row at a time with scalar multiplication.


It is common to use fractions in scalar multiplication, because you often want to create that diagonal row of 1s. Get used to working with fractions. It will also be easier, for most steps in solving the matrix, to be able to write your fractions in improper form, and then convert them back to mixed numbers for the final solution. Therefore, the number 1 2/3 is easier to work with if you write it as 5/3.
For example, the first row (R1) of our sample problem begins with the terms . The solution matrix should contain a 1 in the first position of the first row. In order to “change” our 3 into a 1, we can multiply the entire row by 1/3. Doing this will create the new R1 of .
Be careful to keep any negative signs where they belong.

, The second tool you can use is to add or subtract any two rows of the matrix. In order to create the 0 terms in your solution matrix, you will need to add or subtract numbers that get you to 0. For example, if R1 of a matrix is and R2 is , you can subtract the first row from the second row and create the new row of , because 1-1=0 (first column), 3-4=-1 (second column), 5-3=2 (third column), and 8-2=6 (fourth column). When you perform a row-addition or row-subtraction, rewrite your new result in place of the row you started with. In this case, we would take out row 2 and insert the new row .


You can use some shorthand and indicate this operation as R2-R1=.
Recognize that adding and subtracting are merely opposite forms of the same operation. You can either think of adding two numbers or subtracting the opposite. For example, if you begin with the simple equation 3-3=0, you could consider this instead as an addition problem of 3+(-3)=0. The result is the same. This seems basic, but it is sometimes easier to think of a problem in one form or the other. Just keep track of your negative signs.

, You cannot expect the terms always to match so you can use simple addition or subtraction to create 0s in your matrix. More often, you will need to add (or subtract) a multiple of another row. To do this, you perform the scalar multiplication first, then add that result to the target row that you are trying to change.


Suppose you have a Row 1 of and a Row 2 of . You want to create a 0 term in the first column of R2. That is, you want to change the 2 into a 0. To do this, you need to subtract a 2. You can get a 2 by first multiplying Row 1 by the scalar multiplication 2, and then subtract the first row from the second row. In shorthand, you can think of this as R2-2*R1. First multiply R1 by 2 to get . Then subtract this from R2 to get . Simplify this and your new R2 will be .

, As you work with the matrix, you will be changing a single row at a time, either through scalar multiplication, row-addition or row-subtraction, or a combination step. When you change the one row, make sure to copy the other rows of your matrix in their original form.


A common mistake occurs when conducting a combined multiplication and addition step in one move. Suppose, for example, you need to subtract double R1 from R2. When you multiply R1 by 2 to do this step, remember that you are not changing R1 in the matrix. You are only doing the multiplication to change R2. Copy R1 first in its original form, then make the change to R2.

, To solve your system, you will work in a very organized pattern, essentially “solving” one term of the matrix at a time. The order for a three-variable matrix will begin as follows:


1. Create a 1 in the first row, first column (R1C1).
2. Create a 0 in the second row, first column (R2C1).
3. Create a 1 in the second row, second column (R2C2).
4. Create a 0 in the third row, first column (R3C1).
5. Create a 0 in the third row, second column (R3C2).
6. Create 1 in the third row, third column (R3C3).

, At this point, if you have done the steps correctly, you are halfway to the solution. You should have the diagonal line of 1’s, with 0’s beneath them. The numbers in the fourth column are really irrelevant at this point. Now you will work your way back up to the top as follows:


Create a 0 in the second row, third column (R2C3).
Create a 0 in first row, third column (R1C3).
Create a 0 in the first row, second column (R1C2).

, If your work is correct, you will have created the solution matrix with 1’s in a diagonal line of R1C1, R2C2, R3C3 and 0’s in the other positions of the first three columns. The numbers in the fourth column are the solutions to your linear system.

, To practice these steps, begin with the sample we used before: 3x+y-z=9, 2x-2y+z=-3, and x+y+z=7. When you write this into a matrix, you will have R1= , R2=, and R3=.

, Notice that R1 currently begins with a 3. You need to change it into a 1. You can do this by scalar multiplication, by multiplying all four terms of R1 by 1/3. In shorthand, you can note this as R1*1/3. This will give a new result for R1 as R1=. Copy R2 and R2, unchanged, as R2=and R3=.


Notice that multiplication and division are merely inverse functions of each other. We can say we are multiplying by 1/3 or dividing by 3, and the result is the same.

, Currently, R2=. To move closer to the solution matrix, you need to change the first term from a 2 to a 0. You can do this by subtracting twice the value of R1, since R1 begins with a 1. In shorthand, the operation is R2-2*R1. Remember, you are not changing R1, but just working with it. So first, copy R1 as R1=. Then, when you double each term of R1, you will get 2*R1=. Finally, subtract this result from the original R2 to get your new R2. Working through term by term, this subtraction is (2-2), (-2-2/3), (1-(-2/3)), (-3-6). These simplify to give the new R2=. Notice that first term is 0, which was your objective.


Copy down the unaffected row 3 as R3=.
Be very careful with subtracting negative numbers, to make sure you keep the signs correct.
For now, leave the fractions in their improper forms. This will make later steps of the solution easier. You can simplify fractions in the final step of the problem.

, To continue forming the diagonal line of 1’s, you need to transform the second term -8/3 into 1. Do this by multiplying the entire row by the reciprocal of that number, which is -3/8. Symbolically, this step is R2*(-3/8). The resulting second row is R2=.


Notice that as the left half of the row starts looking like the solution with the 0 and 1, the right half may start looking ugly, with improper fractions. Just carry them along for now.
Remember to continue copying the unaffected rows, so R1=and R3=.

, Your focus now moves to the third row, R3=. To create a 0 in the first position, you will need to subtract a 1 from the 1 that is in that position currently. If you look up, there is a 1 in the first position of R1. Therefore, you simply need to subtract R3-R1 to get the result you need. Working term by term, this will be (1-1), (1-1/3), (1-(-1/3)), (7-3). These four mini-problems simplify to give the new R3=.


Continue to copy along R1=and R2=. Remember that you only change one row at a time.

, This value is currently 2/3, but it needs to be transformed into a 0. At first glance, it looks like you might be able to subtract double the R1 values, since the corresponding column of R1 contains a 1/3. However, if you double all the values of R1 and subtract them, you will affect the 0 in the first column of R3, which you do not want to do. This would be taking a step backward in your solution. So you need to work with some combination of R2. If you subtract 2/3 of R2, you will create a 0 in the second column, without affecting the first column. In shorthand notation, this is R3- 2/3*R2. The individual terms become (0-0), (2/3-2/3), (4/3-(-5/3*2/3)), (4-27/8*2/3). Simplifying gives the result R3=.

, This is a simple step of multiplying by the reciprocal of the number that is there. The current value is 42/24, so you can multiply by 24/42 to create the desired value of 1. Notice that the first two terms are 0’s, so any multiplication will remain 0. The new value of R3=.


Notice that the fractions, which appeared quite complicated in the previous step, have already begun to resolve themselves.
Continue to carry along R1=and R2=.
Notice that at this point, you have the diagonal of 1’s for your solution matrix. You just need to transform three more items of the matrix into 0’s to find your solution.

, R2 currently is , with a value of -5/8 in the third column. You need to transform it to a 0. This means conduction some operation involving R3 that will consist of adding 5/8. Because the corresponding third column of R3 is a 1, you need to multiply all of R3 by 5/8 and add the result to R2. In shorthand, this is R2+5/8*R3. Working term by term, this is R2=(0+0), (1+0), (-5/8+5/8), (27/8+5/8). These simplify to R2=.


Copy along R1=and R3=.

, The first row is currently R1=. You need to transform the -1/3 in the third column to a 0, by using some combination of R3. You do not want to use R2, because the 1 in the second column of R2 would affect R1 in the wrong way. So, you will multiply R3*1/3 and then add the result to R1. The notation for this is R1+1/3*R3. Working it out term by term results in R1=(1+0), (1/3+0), (-1/3+1/3), (3+1/3). These simplify to give a new R1=.


Copy the unchanged R2=and R3=.

, If everything has been done properly, this should be your final step. You need to transform the 1/3 in the second column to a 0. You can get this by multiplying R2*1/3 and subtracting. In shorthand, this is R1-1/3*R2. The result is R1=(1-0), (1/3-1/3), (0-0), (10/3-4/3). Simplifying gives the result of R1=.

, At this point, if all has gone well, you should have the three rows R1=, R2=and R3=. Notice, if you write this in the block matrix form with the rows on top of each other, you will have the diagonal 1’s, with 0’s everywhere else, and your solutions in the fourth column. The solution matrix should look like this:


1 0 0 2
0 1 0 4
0 0 1 1

, When you translated your linear equations into a matrix, you put the x-coefficients in the first column, the y-coefficients in the second column, the z-coefficients in the third column. There, to rewrite your matrix back into equation form, these three lines of the matrix really mean the three equations 1x+0y+0z=2, 0x+1y+0z=4, and 0x+0y+1z=1. Since we can drop the 0-terms and don’t need to write the 1 coefficients, these three equations simplify to give you the solution, x=2, y=4 and z=1. This is the solution to your system of linear equations.

, It is always a good idea to check that your solution actually is correct. You do this by testing your results in the original equations.


Recall that the original equations for this problem were 3x+y-z=9, 2x-2y+z=-3, and x+y+z=7. When you replace the variables with their solved values, you get 3*2+4-1=9, 2*2-2*4+1=-3, and 2+4+1=7.

, Perform the operations in each equation according to the basic rules of operations. The first equation simplifies to 6+4-1=9, or 9=9. The second equation simplifies as 4-8+1=-3, or -3=-3. The final equation is simply 7=7.


Because each equation simplifies to a true mathematical statement, your solutions are correct. If any of them did not resolve correctly, you would have to go back through your work and look for any errors. Some common mistakes occur in dropping negative signs along the way or confusing the multiplication and addition of fractions.

, For this given problem, the final solution is x=2, y=4 and z=1.

However our minds are used to remembering figures from left to right. So for mental multiplication, you can develop a habit of multiplying from left to right.


Take for instance multiplication of 284*7. Build the answer in three steps.
First , 2*7=14
14 , 8*7=56 => add 5 to 14 and stick the 6 on the end, i.e 196

196, 7*4=28=>add 2 to 196 and stick the 8 on the end, i.e 1988 .;
,


Suppose you want to calculate (108*109) where the base is 100. Add 108 and 9 to get 117. Add to the end 9*8, or 72, to get your answer: 11772. Therefore, 108*109=117||72=11772
Another example: (115*106). Add 115 + 6 = 121, and then stick 90(15*6=90) on the end. 115*106=121||90=12190.
Another example: 108*113=121||104 =12204. 121 is 113+8, and 104 is 8*13. Add the 1 from 104 to the last digit of 121 to get an answer with the right number of digits, 12204.
When base is 1000 : Consider 1024*1008. Just write 1032(1024+8=1032). Suffix it with 192(024*8=192) to get 1032192.

,


If you want to calculate (98*89) where base is 100, just write 22((100-98=2)*(100-89=11)=22) and prefix it with 87(98-11=87 or 89-2=87).
When base is 1000: Consider 998*568 .Now just write 864((1000-998=2)*(1000-568=432)).Prefix it with 566(568-2=566 or 998-432=566)

,


Consider the example 32 x 38 = 1216. Both numbers here start with 3 and the last digits (2 and 8) add up to 10.
Multiply 3 (the first digit of both numbers) by 4 (3 + 1) to get 12 for the first part of the answer.
And we multiply the last figures: 2 x 8 = 16 to get the last part of the answer.
Similarly , 42*48=20||16=2016
53*57=30||21=3021
99*91=90||09=9009

,


Consider the example 25*25. The last two digits of the answer are 25. The first part of the answer is the product of the first digit of the number being squared and its successor. In this example, the first digit of 25 is 2, and its successor is 3 (2+1=3). 2 * 3 = 6, so the solution is 625.
Similarly,35*35=(3*4)||25=1225
45*45=(4*5)||25=2025
95*95=(9*10)||25=9025

,


To multiply any 2-figure number by 11 we just put the total of the two digits between the 2 figures. For example, 26 x 11 = 286. Notice that the outer digits in 286 are the 2 and 6 from 26. The middle figure is the sum of 2 and 6.
45*11=495
65*11=715. This involves a carry: 6+5 = 11, which is now added to the 6 to get 71 for the first two digits.
For 3 digits, 132*11=1||(1+3=4)||(3+2=5)||2=1452
148*11=  1 ||  (1+4=5    5+1(carry)=  6  ) || (4+8=12 =>2 carry 1)||8 =1628

Understand a percentage as a fraction, as a number out of 100.,
Subtract the numerators.,
Do NOT simplify.",How to Subtract Percentages in Math2," So convert a percentage to a fraction, place the percent in the numerator, and 100 in the denominator.For example, 75%−23%{\displaystyle 75\%-23\%} is the same as 75100−23100{\displaystyle {\frac {75}{100}}-{\frac {23}{100}}}.
;
, When subtracting fractions that have the same denominator, you simply subtract the numerators, then place the difference over the original denominator.For example, since 75−23=52{\displaystyle 75-23=52}, you know that 75100−23100=52100{\displaystyle {\frac {75}{100}}-{\frac {23}{100}}={\frac {52}{100}}}.


, A percent is a number out of 100.To convert the fraction back to a percent, simply take the numerator and label it as a percent.

For example, 52100{\displaystyle {\frac {52}{100}}} converted to a percent is 52%{\displaystyle 52\%}.

For example, 68%−9.5%{\displaystyle 68\%-9.5\%} is the same as .68−.095{\displaystyle .68-.095} (or 68 hundredths minus 95 thousandths).


, You can use a calculator to do this quickly. You can also do it by hand. Set up the problem vertically. Align the decimal points in each number, then subtract as usual. Drop the decimal point down into your answer.

For example:0.680−0.0950.585{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}0.680\\-0.095\\\hline \\0.585\end{array}}} 


, To do this, move the decimal place back two places to the right. Take this answer and label it as a percent.

For example, to convert 0.585{\displaystyle 0.585} to a percent, move the decimal place two places to the right: 58.5{\displaystyle 58.5}. So, 68%−9.5%=58.5%{\displaystyle 68\%-9.5\%=58.5\%}


, For example:

 68.0%−9.5%58.5%{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}68.0\%\\-9.5\%\\\hline \\58.5\%\end{array}}}

Anticipate a negative difference.,
Reverse the order of the minuend and subtrahend.,
Subtract as you normally would.,
Add a negative sign to the difference.,
 Alternatively, subtract them directly.",How to Subtract Percentages in Math4," Any time you subtract a larger percentage from a smaller percentage, the difference will be negative. These situations require additional steps when subtracting.

For example, you might need to subtract 123.688% from 50%. Since 123.688 is larger than 50, your answer will be negative.


, The minuend is the number you are subtracting from, and the subtrahend is the number you are subtracting.If you are working with decimals, align the decimal points and use zeros to extend place values as needed.

For example:50.000%−123.688%{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}50.000\%\\-123.688\%\\\hline \end{aligned}}} becomes123.688%−50.000%{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}123.688\%\\-50.000\%\\\hline \end{aligned}}}


, Borrow from larger place values when necessary. You should end up with a positive number.

For example: 123.688%−50.000%73.688%{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}123.688\%\\-50.000\%\\\hline \\73.688\%\end{aligned}}}


, If you visualize a number line, you should see that the difference is the absolute distance between the two numbers. However, since in the original problem you begin with a smaller number and subtract a larger number, you would move left on the number line, past zero, and thus end up with a negative number.

Thus, 50%−123.688%=−73.688%{\displaystyle 50\%-123.688\%=-73.688\%}.


, For example:

 50.000%−123.688%−73.688%{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}50.000\%\\-123.688\%\\\hline \\-73.688\%\end{array}}}


"
"
Assess what the problem is.,
Convert the percentage to a decimal.,
Multiply the decimal by the whole value.,
Subtract the product from the whole value.,
Alternatively, realize that a 30% discount means the price or value will represent the difference: 

 100%−30%{\displaystyle 100\%-30\%} = 70%{\displaystyle 70\%}

 The price will be 70% of the original price, so simply find 70% of $120 -- using the decimal equivalent 70% = 0.70 multiply the original price -- to get the discounted price.",How to Subtract Percentages in Math5," You are likely being asked to take a percentage discount off of a price or value. For example, you might be asked what 30% off 120 dollars is.
, To do this, remove the percentage sign and think of the percent as a whole number. Then, move the decimal point two places to the left.Sometimes the percent will have a decimal already (such as in 7.5%). If there is no decimal, remember that a whole number always has an understood decimal to the right of the ones place (such as 75 = 75.00).

For example, 30%{\displaystyle 30\%} converted to a decimal is 0.30{\displaystyle 0.30}.


, You can multiply be a calculator, or by hand. If multiplying by hand, set up the problem like a regular multiplication problem. Multiply the numbers as usual. Your final answer should have two places to the right of its decimal point. For more information on how to multiply decimals, read Multiply Decimals.

For example, 120×0.3036.00{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}120\\\times 0.30\\\hline \\36.00\end{array}}}


, The difference is the result of subtracting the percent of a value from the whole value.

For example, 120−36=84{\displaystyle 120-36=84}. So, 120−30%=84{\displaystyle 120-30\%=84}. 


, 

For example, $120×0.70$84.00{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}\$120\\\times 0.70\\\hline \\\$84.00\end{array}}}

Pat yourself on the back.",How to Solve Math Word Puzzles," Does it start with ""how much,"" ""how long,"" ""who has more,"" or something else? Identifying your end goal is the first step to finding the answer. The question included in the given example would be ""how many marshmallows does Henry have?"".;
, A list based off the given example would look like this:


Sally = 15
Tommy = 7
Henry = (1/3) X (Sally).

, As disheartening as it is, the word problem might be trying to trick you. It is, however, no match for the skills you are bound to acquire after reading this article. Tommy's information would not be included because his marshmallows are not required to complete the problem. The final question, which was identified in step one, does not include Tommy. Sally's information is still necessary, however, because her name is in Henry's equation. Do you see where this is going?


Sally = 15
Henry = (1/3) X (Sally).

, You now have a list of only the facts necessary to answer the final question. If done correctly, you should be able to replace any unknown variables in your final equation with other information on your list. Eventually, your list should be simplified to the point where all you have left to do is solve a simple math problem. The example above would require one to replace the (Sally) in Henry's equation with Sally's equivalent: 15. You then wind up with this:


Henry= (1/3) X 15.

Read the problem carefully.,
Determine the hourly rate of each individual.,
Create a ratio for their combined hourly rate.,
Set up the equation.,
Add the fractions together.,
Solve for t{\displaystyle t}.,
Simplify the fraction, if necessary.",How to Solve Combined Labor Problems1," Use this method if the problem represents two or more people working together to complete a job. The problem should also give you the amount of time it would take each person to complete the job alone.

For example, the problem might ask, “If Tommy can paint a room in 3 hours, and Winnie can paint the same room in 4 hours, how long will it take them to paint the room together?
;
, The hourly rate is represented by creating a fraction, where the total number of hours it takes to complete the job is the denominator (bottom number), and 1 is the numerator (top number).For example, if Tommy can paint a room in 3 hours, his hourly rate is 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}}; that is, each hour he completes 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}} of a room. If Winnie takes 4 hours to paint a room, her hourly rate is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}.


, This will be 1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{t}}}, where t{\displaystyle t} equals the amount of time it takes them to complete the job together., Because they are working together, their combined hourly rate will equal the sum of their individual hourly rates.For example, if Tommy paints 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}} of a room in 1 hour, Winnie paints 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of a room in 1 hour, and together they complete 1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{t}}} of a room in 1 hour, the equation will be:13+14=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{4}}={\frac {1}{t}}}.


, You will need to find the least common denominator. For complete instructions on how to add fractions, you can read the article Add Fractions.

For example, 12 is the least common denominator of 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}} and 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, thus:13+14=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{4}}={\frac {1}{t}}}412+312=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{12}}+{\frac {3}{12}}={\frac {1}{t}}}712=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{12}}={\frac {1}{t}}}


, To do this, cross multiply.In this instance, you can also simply take the inverse of the fraction.For example:712=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{12}}={\frac {1}{t}}}7t=12{\displaystyle 7t=12}t=127{\displaystyle t={\frac {12}{7}}}


, This will give you the number of hours it takes for the workers to complete the job together.

For example, if Tommy takes 3 hours to paint a room, and Winnie takes 4 hours to complete a room, together they can complete a room in 127{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{7}}}, or 157{\displaystyle 1{\frac {5}{7}}} of an hour. This equals almost two hours (about 1 hour, 43 minutes).

It might be helpful to box out a work space where you do your calculations. Then, write any conclusions or information in a different box where you have room to keep them organized. Using tables and bubble maps can be helpful. Use whatever organizational methods work best for you.
;
, Don’t assume that you know what the problem is asking. Wordy math problems can be very misleading, and if you don’t read all of the information, you can be easily tricked.For example, you might have the following problem: Joe has 7 marbles: 2 red, 1 blue, 3 yellow, and 1 green. He gave 1 red and 1 yellow to Steve. How many more marbles should Joe buy to have a dozen marbles?

If you did not read the entire problem above, you might assume the problem was asking how many marbles Joe had after giving 2 marbles to Steve. But the problem is asking a very different question.


, The writers of wordy math problems are trying to confuse you by cramming a lot of information into the problem. Sometimes this information is relevant; sometimes it isn’t. To understand what to do with all of the information you are given, it’s best to read the problem sentence-by-sentence. Pause after you read each piece of information to fully process what you have read.Reading slowly will prevent you from being overwhelmed, as well as make it easier to sift the relevant facts from the problem.


, After reading the problem carefully, locate what the problem is asking you to find. Often this information will be at the end of the problem, in the form of a question, but not always.Underline the question so that you can easily refer back to it will working through the problem.

For example, underline the sentence: “How many more marbles should Joe buy to have a dozen marbles?”


, For problems that are very wordy, you will likely come across information that is not necessary for answering the question. Re-read the problem and cross out this information. This will make the information and steps you need to solve the problem easier to parse.

Be absolutely certain that information is unnecessary before crossing it out.

It might also help to consolidate information. For example, if the problem describes the parts or components of a whole, but all you need to know is information about the whole, cross out the information about the parts and write in what those parts add up to.

For example, it is irrelevant to know that Joe had 2 red, 1 blue, 3 yellow, and 1 green marble. All that is important is that he had 7 marbles. It is also irrelevant that 1 of the marbles he gave Steve was red and 1 was orange. All you need to know is that he gave Steve 2 marbles.


, Highlighting important information makes it easier to reference as you solve. You can also rewrite this information to make it clearer.

For example, you can highlight the phrases “Joe has 7 marbles” and “He gave Steve 2.” 


, Visualize what is happening in the word problem. Then, draw a picture or diagram that represents the known information.This will help you determine which information is unknown, and what steps you can take to find out this information.

For example, in one color, draw Joe’s 7 marbles. Then, cross out the 2 he gives to Steve. Finally, in another color, draw more marbles until the amount is equal to 12.


, If these are included with the problem, they will likely already be labeled. Make sure you understand what each piece of information means. Check the graph against the word problem to understand how each piece of information is represented in the graph.

If you drew your own graph or diagram, label it clearly now, so that you are not confused when you use it later to help you solve the problem. 


, Highlighting these in the problem will help you translate the written words into math. Specifically, keywords can give you clues about which operations to use in order to find the answer.For example:

Phrases that indicate addition include “more than,” “total of,” and “added to.”Phrases that indicate subtraction include “decreased by,” “difference between,” and “less than.”Words that indicate multiplication include “of” and “times.”Words that indicate division include “per” and “out of.”In the sample problem, you would highlight the word “give,” which denotes subtraction. You would also highlight the phrase “how many more,” which suggests addition.


, Word problems that ask for a specific quantity will usually only have one unknown, but if the word problem is asking for an equation, you might have multiple unknowns, and therefore multiple variables. A variable can be any letter or symbol.For example, let x{\displaystyle x} equal the number of marbles Joe needs to buy to have a dozen (12) marbles.  


, Think about the known information, unknown information, what you are trying to find, and how you can find it. Use the keywords and key phrases to translate the English into an algebraic equation.For example, you know that Joe begins with 7 marbles, gives away 2, adds an unknown amount, and ends up with 12. So, your equation will be 7−2+x=12{\displaystyle 7-2+x=12}. 


, To find the value of a variable, you need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Follow the regular rules of  algebra to do this, and remember to keep the equation balanced. This means that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side.

For example, to find the value of x{\displaystyle x} in the equation 7−2+x=12{\displaystyle 7-2+x=12}, you would calculate:7−2+x=12{\displaystyle 7-2+x=12}5+x=12{\displaystyle 5+x=12}5+x−5=12−5{\displaystyle 5+x-5=12-5}x=7{\displaystyle x=7}So, Joe needs to buy 7 marbles to have a dozen.


, Make sure that your answer is reasonable.You should also plug the value of the variable back into the equation to verify that it makes the equation true.If your answer does not seem correct, follow all the steps again to check where you went wrong.

For example, since Joe only wants 12 marbles, it is reasonable that he would need to buy 7. Substituting your solution for the variable, you would calculate:7−2+x=12{\displaystyle 7-2+x=12}7−2+7=12{\displaystyle 7-2+7=12}5+7=12{\displaystyle 5+7=12}12=12{\displaystyle 12=12}Since this is true, you know your solution is correct.


, Bella has 48 colored pencils. Eight of her pencils are primary colors. Another 8 are secondary colors. The rest of the pencils are tertiary colors. She gets 12 more colored pencils for her birthday. Half of these pencils are primary colors. How many primary colored pencils does she have all together?
, Don’t stress out about extraneous information that you might not understand. For example, you don’t need to know what a primary, secondary, or tertiary color is in order to solve this problem. In this problem, the question comes in the last sentence: How many primary colored pencils does Bella have now? So, you only need to worry about how many primary colors Bella has all together; you don’t need to know what a primary color is.
, It is not important to know that Bella begins with 48 total pencils. Since you are asked to find the number of primary pencils she has, it is only important to know that she begins with 8 primary pencils. It is also important to know that half of the 12 pencils she gets for her birthday are also primary colors. It is not important to know how many of her pencils are secondary or tertiary colors.
, For this problem, you might draw 8 colored pencils in one group. Then, draw 12 colored pencils in another group. Draw a circle that encompasses the group of 8, and half of the group of 12.
, The phrase “half of” indicates that something will be multiplied by 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} (or divided by 2). The phrase “all together” indicates that addition will be involved.
, The unknown information is how many primary colored pencils Bella has altogether. So, let the variable x{\displaystyle x} stand for this quantity. We know that she begins with 8 primary pencils, and that when she is given 12 more colored pencils, half of them are also primary. Thus, the equation would be 8+12(12)=x{\displaystyle 8+{\frac {1}{2}}(12)=x}.
, For the equation you would first find half of 12, and then add:8+12(12)=x{\displaystyle 8+{\frac {1}{2}}(12)=x}8+6=x{\displaystyle 8+6=x}14=x{\displaystyle 14=x}So, altogether, 14 of Bella’s pencils are primary colors. To check, consider whether this answer is reasonable. Since Bella begins with 8 primary colored pencils, and is given less than 12 more, it seems reasonable that she would end up with 14 primary colored pencils.

Solve for t{\displaystyle t} by cross multiplying.Note that, In this instance, you can also simply take the inverse of the fraction.For example:26=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}2t=6{\displaystyle 2t=6}2t=6{\displaystyle 2t=6}t=62{\displaystyle t={\frac {6}{2}}}


,
Simplify the fraction, if necessary.",How to Solve Combined Labor Problems2," Use this method if the problem represents one person (or thing) completing a job and another person (or thing) undoing the job the other person is doing. A typical problem involves pipes filling and draining a pool.For example, the problem might ask, “If a hose can fill a pool 6 hours, and an open drain can empty it in 2 hours, how long will it take the open drain to empty the pool with the hose on?”


, Look at the problem carefully to determine which individual this is. If the goal is to empty something, the individual doing the draining is completing the job. The hourly rate is is represented by creating a fraction, where the total number hours it takes to complete the job is the denominator (bottom number), and 1 is the numerator (top number).For example, if a drain can empty a pool in 2 hours, and you need to calculate how long it takes to empty the pool, then the drain is completing the job. Its hourly rate is 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}; that is, each hour it empties12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} of the pool.


, Remember that the total number of hours it takes to undo the job will be in the denominator, and 1 will be in the numerator.For example, if the hose can fill a pool in 3 hours, but the goal is to empty the pool, then the hose is undoing the job. If the hose fills the pool in 6 hours, Its hourly rate is 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}; that is, each hour it fills 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}} of the pool. 


, This will be 1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{t}}}, where t{\displaystyle t} equals the amount of time it takes them to complete the job while working against each other., Because they are working against each other, their combined hourly rate will equal the difference between their individual hourly rates.This is the hourly rate of the individual completing the job minus the hourly rate of the individual undoing the job.

For example, if a drain empties 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} of a pool in 1 hour, a hose fills 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}} of a pool in 1 hour, and together they empty 1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{t}}} of a pool in 1 hour, the equation will be:12−16=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}.


, You will need to find the least common denominator. For complete instructions on how to subtract fractions, you can read the article Subtract Fractions.

For example, 6 is the least common denominator of 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} and 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}}, thus:12−16=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}36−16=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{6}}-{\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}26=1t{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}={\frac {1}{t}}}


,, This will give you the number of hours it takes for the individuals to complete the job while working against each other.

For example, if a hose fills a pool in 6 hours, and a drain empties the pool in 2 hours to, working against each other, the pool will drain in 62{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{2}}} hours, or 3{\displaystyle 3} hours.

Solve for h{\displaystyle h}.",How to Solve Combined Labor Problems3," Use this method if the problem represents two or more people (or things) working together to complete a job for a part of the time, and then just one individual (or thing) finishing (or starting) the job alone. The problem should also provide the hourly rate of each individual.

For example, the problem might be: “Damarion can clean the cat shelter in 8 hours, and Cassandra can clean the shelter in 4 hours. They work together for 2 hours, but then Cassandra leaves to take some cats to the vet. How long will it take for Damarion to finish cleaning the shelter on his own?”


, The hourly rate is is represented by creating a fraction, where the total number hours it takes to complete the job is the denominator (bottom number), and 1 is the numerator (top number).For example, if Damarion can clean the cat shelter in 8 hours, his hourly rate is 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}}; that is, each hour he completes 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} of a room. If Cassandra takes 4 hours to clean the shelter, her hourly rate is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}.


, To do this, add their hourly rates together. For complete instructions on how to add fractions, read the article Add Fractions.

For example, if Damarion cleans 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} of the room in an hour, and Cassandra completes 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the room an hour, together they will complete 18+14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}} of the room in an hour:18+14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}=216+416{\displaystyle ={\frac {2}{16}}+{\frac {4}{16}}}=616{\displaystyle ={\frac {6}{16}}}


, To do this, multiply how much they complete in an hour by how many hours they worked together.For complete instructions on how to multiply fractions, read Multiply Fractions.

For example, if Damarion and Cassandra together clean 616{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{16}}} of the shelter in 1 hour, in two hours they complete twice that much:616×2{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{16}}\times 2}=1216{\displaystyle ={\frac {12}{16}}}=34{\displaystyle ={\frac {3}{4}}} of the shelter


, To do this, subtract the fraction of what they did from 1 whole. For complete instructions on how to subtract fractions, read Subtract Fractions.

For example, if Damarion and Cassandra cleaned 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} of the shelter in 2 hours, then after Cassandra leaves, Damarion has to clean 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the shelter on his own.


, You are looking for how long it will take the work to be completed by the remaining individual. To do this, you need to multiply the individual’s hourly rate times the number of hours (h{\displaystyle h}) it will take to complete the job. This will be equal to the amount of the job that needs to be finished.For example, if Damarion cleans the shelter at a rate of 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} per hour, and he needs to complete 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the job on his own, you equation will be 18h=14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}h={\frac {1}{4}}}, or, more simply, h8=14{\displaystyle {\frac {h}{8}}={\frac {1}{4}}}


, To do this, cross multiply the two fractions. Make sure to simplify the fractions, if necessary. This will give you the number of hours it takes the remaining person to complete the job on his or her own.

For example:h8=14{\displaystyle {\frac {h}{8}}={\frac {1}{4}}}4h=8{\displaystyle 4h=8}h=2{\displaystyle h=2}So, it will take Damarion 2 hours to complete the job on his own.

For example, say you are trying to simplify the absolute value of an expression, -6 + 3. Since the entire expression is within the absolute value bars, do the addition first. The problem is now to simplify the absolute value of -3.;
, Once you have performed any operations inside the absolute value bars, you can simplify the absolute value. Whatever number you have as your argument, whether positive or negative, represents a distance from 0, so your answer is that number, and it is positive.


In the example above, the simplified absolute value is 3. This is true because the distance between 0 and -3 is 3.

, Optionally, you can also note your answer using a number line. This step can help you visualize absolute values and check your work.


For the example above, your number line should look like this.

Review rounding on a number line (optional).,
Write down a number with a decimal point.,
Find the tenths place.,
Look at the hundredths place.,
Round the tenths place up if the hundredths place is 5 or more.,
Round down if the hundredths place is 4 or less.,
Round down to a zero in the tenths place.,
Round negative numbers.,
Round extra long numbers.,
Keep numbers with no hundredths place the same.",How to Round to the Nearest Tenth," Let's ignore the decimals for a moment and try rounding to tens instead. Draw a number line from 10 to 20. The numbers on the left half of the line (like 13 or 11) are closer to 10, so they round to 10. The numbers on the right half (like 16 or 17) are closer to 20, so they round to 20. Rounding with decimals can seem confusing, but it's really the same process. You could relabel your number line as ""0.10, 0.11, 0.12, ..., 0.19, 0.2"" and you'd have a number line for rounding to the nearest tenth.;
, It doesn't matter how many digits come after the decimal.



Example 1: Round 7.86 to the nearest tenth.

Example 2: Round 247.137 to the nearest tenth.

, The tenths place is immediately to the right of the decimal point. After rounding to the nearest tenth, this will be the final digit in your number. For now, just underline this digit.



Example 1: In the number 7.86, the 8 is in the tenths place.

Example 2: In the number 247.137, the 1 is in the tenths place.

, The hundredths place is the digit to the right of the decimal point. This digit tells you whether to round up or down.



Example 1: In the number 7.86, the 6 is in the hundredths place.

Example 2: In the number 247.137, the 3 is in the hundredths place.
The digits to the right of the hundredths do not matter when you're rounding to the nearest tenth. They represent ""extra stuff"" to small to make a difference.

, Is the digit in the hundredths place is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9? If it is, ""round up"" by adding 1 to the tenths place digit. Get rid of all digits after the tenths place, and you have your answer.



Example 1: The number 7.86 has a 6 in the hundredths place. Round up by adding 1 to the tenths place to get 7.9, removing the digits to the right.

, Is the digit in the hundredths place 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0? If it is, ""round down"" by leaving the tenth place as it is. Just remove any digits in the hundredths place and further to the right.



Example 2: The number 247.137 has a 3 in the hundredths place. Round down by removing everything past the tenths place, to get 247.1.

, If there's a zero in the tenths place and your round down, keep the zero in your answer. For example, 4.03 rounded to the nearest tenth is 4.0. This gives people a better idea of the accuracy of your number. Just writing ""4"" isn't wrong, but it hides the fact that you were working with decimals.

, Rounding negative numbers is basically the same as rounding positive numbers. Follow the same process and always keep the minus sign in your answer. For example, -12.56 round to -12.6, and -400.333 rounds to -400.3.


Be careful about using the phrases ""round down"" and ""round up."" If you look at a number line for negative numbers, you'll see that rounding -12.56 to -12.6 moves left, so that's ""rounding down"" even though you increased the tenth digit by 1.

, Don't get confused by super long numbers. The rules stay the same. Find the tenths place and figure out whether to round up or down. After rounding, all the numbers to the left of the tenths place will stay the same, and all the numbers to the right of the tenths place will disappear. Here are three examples:


7192403242401.29 rounds to 7192403242401.3
5.0620138424107 rounds to 5.1
9000.30001 rounds to 9000.3

, Does the number end in the tenths place, with nothing further to the right? This number is already rounded to the nearest tenth, so you don't need to do anything here. Your textbook might be trying to trick you.


For example, 1509.2 is already rounded to the nearest tenth.

Deal with an argument that is just a variable.,
Recognize absolute value inequalities.,
Graph a number line.,
Consider the numbers on the left side of the number line.,
Consider the numbers on the right side of the number line.,
Find the intersect of the two intervals.",How to Simplify Absolute Values2," If your argument is just a variable by itself, set equal to a number, then simplifying is very easy. Since absolute value represents a distance from 0, your variable could be either the positive number to which it is equal, or it could be the negative version of that number. There is no way to tell, so include both possibilities in your solution.


For example, say you know that the absolute value of a variable, x, is equal to 3. You cannot tell if x is positive or negative; you are looking for any number whose distance is 3 from 0. Therefore, you solution is either 3 or -3.
If this is the kind of argument you need to simplify, stop here. Your work is done. If, however, you have an inequality, continue on.

, If, however, you are given an argument with a variable, expressed as an inequality, more steps are required. Interpret these inequalities as asking you to find all the possible numbers that could work.


For example, say you have the following inequality.
This can be interpreted as “Show all numbers whose absolute value is less than 7.” In other words, find all numbers whose distance is 7 from 0, excluding 7 itself. Note that the inequality is constructed as “less than” rather than “less than or equal to.” If it were the later, then 7 itself would be included.

, The first thing to do, when faced with an absolute value inequality, is to draw a number line. Tag points corresponding with the numbers with which you are working.


In the example above, your number line would look like this.
The open circles indicate numbers excluded from your final result. Remember: if the inequality were stated as “greater than or equal to” or “less than or equal to,” then these numbers would be included instead. In that case, the circles would be solid.

, Since you don’t know whether your variable is positive or negative, you are really dealing with two possible ranges of numbers: those on the left side of the number line and those on the right. First, consider the numbers on the left. Make the variable negative, and convert your absolute value bars to parentheses. Solve.


In the example above, you would convert the absolute value bars to parentheses to show that (-x) is less than 7. Multiply both sides of the inequality by -1. Note that when you multiply by a negative number, you must switch the inequality sign (from less than to greater than, or vice versa). Your inequality would look like this.
You now know that for the left side of the number line, x will be greater than -7. On a number line, that would look like this.

, Now you can look at the other range of numbers, those that are positive. This is even simpler: make the variable positive, convert your absolute value bars to parentheses.


In the example above, you would convert the absolute value bars to parentheses to show that (x) is less than 7. No further work is necessary for this step. On a number line, that would look like this.

, Once you have considered both sides, you need to determine where the solutions overlap. Draw both intervals on the same number line to get a final result.


In the example above, you would highlight values greater than -7 and less than 7 (but excluding -7 and 7 themselves). These are your solutions.

,, The problem is to set a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i = a^(b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i) = y. Algebraically, dividing both sides by a gives, after simplification, b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i = a^((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i).-1), and inverting the exponent and raising both sides to it gives (b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)^(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1)) = a, after simplifying. So, fine, there is an isolated and defined but isolating much of anything else is going to be quite difficult if not impossible. One can say, however, that since a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i= y and (b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)^(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1)) = a, that (b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)^(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1))bcdefghj = j. Therefore, (bcdefghj)^(1+(1/((b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i)-1))) = y. But unless one knows the values of a or b through 0, one is at pretty much of a loss to say much else definitively. One might be able to build this structure up through series of steps, however, algebraically or by goal seeking. That is because ab = a^b becomes ab/a = (a^b)/a becomes b = a^(b-1) becomes b^(1/(b-1)) = a. The latter route of goal seeking has proven fruitful, however, if somewhat obvious. Obvious because, no matter the value selected for a, so long as b thru whatever multiply to 1 via reciprocals, they will also be raising a to the power of 1, via reciprocals that produce 1. So, for example, x*25*.04 = 1x = x and x^(25*.04) = x^1 = x also. And while there are other solutions, this one meets the criteria and is easy for Excel to calculate, so that's what its goal seeking function does in this case.

Determine the place value to which the number is to be rounded.,
Identify the place value that you will round the number to.,
Locate the number to the right of the rounding number.,
Round the rounding digit up one digit if the digit to the right is greater than or equal to 5.,
Round the rounding digit down if the digit to the right is less than 5.",How to Round Numbers1," This can be determined by your teacher if you're working on a math problem, or you can figure it out based on the context and the sets of numbers you're using. For example when rounding money, you'd most likely want to round to the nearest hundredth, or the nearest cent. When rounding off a weight, round to the nearest pound.


The less precise number required, the more you can round (to higher place values).
More precise numbers should be rounded to lesser place values.;
, If you're working with the number 10.7659, let's say you've decided to round the number to the thousandth digit, which is the 5 digit in the thousandths place, the third digit to the right of the decimal point. You can also think of this as rounding the number to five significant digits. So, focus on the digit 5 for now.

, Just look one digit to the right. In this case, you'll find a 9 next to the 5 digit. This number will determine whether you will round the 5 digit up or down.

, This is called rounding up because the number you were rounding to becomes greater than the original number. Your original digit, 5, becomes a 6. All of the numbers to the left of the original 5 will remain the same, and the numbers to the right of it will disappear (you can think of them as becoming zeroes). So, if you're rounding the number 10.7659 to the 5 digit, it would be rounded up to a 6, making the number 10.766.


Though 5 is in the middle of the numbers 1-9, it is universally agreed that the digit 5 will require a number before it to be rounded up. This may not apply to your teachers when they submit final grades, though!, If the number to the right of your rounding place value digit is less than 5, the rounding place value digit will remain the same. Though this process is called rounding down, it just means that the rounding digit remains the same; you should never actually change a digit to a lower number. In this case, if you're working with the number 10.7653, you would round it down to 10.765 because the digit 3 to the right of the 5 is on the low end of the scale.


By keeping it the same and changing all numbers to its right to 0, the final rounded number is less than the original beginning number. Thus, the number, as a whole, goes down.
The above two steps are represented on most desktop calculators as 5/4 rounding. There is usually a slide-switch you can move to the 5/4 rounding position to achieve these results.

Round off a number to the nearest tens digit.,
Round off a number to the nearest hundreds digit.,
Round off a number to the nearest thousands digit.",How to Round Numbers2," To do this, simply look at the number to the right of the tens digit of the rounding number. The tens digit is the digit that is second from last in a number, before the ones digit. (If you're looking at 12, look at the number 2.) Then, if that number is less than 5, keep the rounding number the same; if it is greater than or equal to 5 round the rounding number up one digit. Here are some examples:12 --> 10
114 --> 110
57 --> 60
1,334 --> 1330
1,488 --> 1490
97--> 100

, Follow the same protocol for rounding a number to the nearest hundreds digit. Check out the hundreds digit, which is the third from last in a number, just before the tens digit. (In the number 1,234, the 2 is in the hundreds digit). Then use the number to the right of the hundreds digit, the tens digit, to see if you should round that number up or down, making the numbers after it even 00s. Here are some examples:7,891 -- > 7,900
15,753 --> 15,800
99, 961 --> 100,000
3,350 --> 3,300
450 --> 500

, The same rules apply here. Just know how to locate the thousands digit, which is fourth from the end of a number, and then check out the digit in the hundreds place, which will be to the right of that number. If the digit is less than 5, round down, and if it's greater than or equal to 5, round up. Here are a few more examples to consider:8,800 --> 9,000
1,015 --> 1,000
12,450 --> 12,000
333,878 --> 334,000
400,400 --> 400,000

Understand what a significant digit is.,
Round a number to an amount of significant digits.,
Round to the correct number of significant digits in addition.,
Round to the correct number of significant digits in multiplication.",How to Round Numbers3," You can think of a significant digit as an ""interesting"" or an ""important"" digit that gives you useful information about a number. This means that any zeroes to the right of whole numbers or to the left of decimals can be discounted because they are placeholders. To find the number of significant digits in a number, just count the number of digits from left to right. Here are some examples:1.239 has 4 significant digits
134.9 has 4 significant digits
.0165 has 3 significant digits

, This depends on the problem you're working with. If you're rounding a number to two significant digits, for example, then you'll need to identify the second significant digit of the number and then use the number to the right of it to see if you should round it down or up. Here are some examples:1.239 rounded to 3 significant digits is 1.24. This is because the digit to the right of the third digit, 3, is a 9, which is 5 or more.
134.9 rounded to 1 significant digit is 100. This is because the digit to the right of the digit in the hundreds place, or the first digit, 1, is 3, which is less than 5.
0.0165 rounded to 2 significant digits is 0.017. This is because the second significant digit is 6, and the number to the right of it, 5, makes it round up.

, To do this, you will first have to add up the numbers you are given. Then, you will have to find the number with the lowest amount of significant digits and then round your entire answer to that place. Here's how you do it:13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38 = 261.2290
See that the second number, 234.6, is only accurate to the tenths place, or four significant digits.
Round the answer so that it is only accurate to the tenths place. 261.2290 becomes 261.2.

, First, multiply all of the numbers that you are given. Then, check them to see which number is rounded to the least amount of significant digits. Finally, round your finally answer to match the level of accuracy of that number. Here's how you do it:16.235 × 0.217 × 5 = 17.614975
Notice that the 5 number only has one significant digit. This means that your final answer will only have one significant digit as well.
17.614975 rounded to one significant digit becomes 20.

Add the real portions together.,
Add the imaginary portions together.,
Combine the two parts to form the simplified answer.",How to Simplify Complex Numbers1," Recognize that addition and subtraction are really the same process. Subtraction is nothing more than adding a negative number. Therefore, addition and subtraction are treated as versions of the same process. To add two or more complex numbers, first just add the real portions of the numbers together.For example, to simplify the sum of (a+bi) and (c+di), first identify that a and c are the real number portions, and add them together. Symbolically, this will be (a+c).

Using actual numbers instead of variables, consider the example of (3+3i) + (5-2i). The real portion of the first number is 3, and the real portion of the second complex number is 5. Add these together to get 3+5=8. The real portion of the simplified complex number will be 8.
;
, In a separate operation, identify the imaginary portions of each complex number and add them together.For the algebraic example of (a+bi) plus (c+di), the imaginary portions are b and d. Adding these together algebraically gives the result (b+d)i. 

Using the numerical example of (3+3i) + (5-2i), the imaginary portions of the two complex numbers are 3i and -2i. Adding these gives the result of 1i, which can also be written just as i.


, To find the final simplified version of the sum, put the real part and the imaginary part back together. The result is the simplified sum of the complex numbers.The sum of (a+bi) and (c+di) is written as (a+c) + (b+d)i. 

Applying the numerical example, the sum of (3+3i) + (5-2i) is 8+i.

Look at the ratio.,
Factor out the first number.,
Factor out the second number.,
Find the greatest common factor.,
Divide both sides by the greatest common factor.,
Write down the final answer.",How to Simplify a Ratio1," A ratio is an expression used to compare two quantities. A simplified ratio should be taken as is, but if a ratio has not been simplified already, you should do so now to make the quantities easier to compare and understand. In order to simplify a ratio, you will need to divide both sides by the same number.Example: 15:21

Note that neither number in this example is a prime number. Since that is the case, you'll need to factor out both numbers to determine whether or not the two terms have any like factors that can be used in the simplification process.

;
, A factor is a whole number that you can divide the term by evenly, giving you another whole number. Both terms in the ratio must share at least one factor (other than the number 1), but before you can determine if the two terms share a factor, you must discover what the factors of each term are.



Example: The number 15 has four factors: 1, 3, 5, 15

15 / 1 = 15
15 / 3 = 5



, In a separate space, list all the factors of the ratio's second term. For the time being, do not worry about the factors of the first term and only focus on factoring this second term.



Example: The number 21 has four factors: 1, 3, 7, 21

21 / 1 = 21
21 / 3 = 7



, Look at the factors for both terms in your ratio. Circle, list, or otherwise identify all numbers that appear in both lists. If the only shared factor is 1, then the ratio is already in its simplified form and no further work needs to be done. If the two terms of the ratio have other shared factors, however, sort through them and identify the highest number. This number is your greatest common factor (GCF).



Example: Both 15 and 21 share two common factors: 1 and 3

The GCF for the two numbers of your original ratio is 3.



, Since both terms of your original ratio share the GCF, you should be able to divide both sides separately and come up with whole numbers as a result. Both sides must be divided by the GCF; do not only divide one side.



Example: Both 15 and 21 must be divided by 3.

15 / 3 = 5
21 / 3 = 7



, You should be left with a new terms on both sides of the ratio. Your new ratio is equivalent to the original ratio, meaning that the quantities of both forms are in the same proportion.Also note that the quantities on both sides of your new ratio should not share any common factors between them.



Example: 5:7

Find a kind willing partner.,
Ask him to pick a whole number between one and ten.,

Add some panache to your performance.While the most important thing is that you get the steps down right, you're ultimately performing a magic trick for them, and magic requires a certain level of style.,
Understand that certain parts of each trick are smoke and mirrors.A large part of performance magic is in distracting your audience with otherwise useless steps and information.,
Identify unique patterns and occurrences in mathematics.,
Acknowledge that every answer hinges upon the constant information in the equation.Adding superfluous additions and subtractions can be done as many times as you want, so long as you're ultimately able to nullify your friend's chosen variable.,
Try inventing a trick of your own.",How to Read Someone's Mind With Math (Math Trick)," Find someone you're looking to impress, who has a few minutes to spare for your trick. It's best to find somewhere quiet to do this, as an interruption risks messing it up.;
, In theory, they could choose any real number. However, it's best to stick between one and ten for the sake of simplicity. Larger numbers will complicate the math; so will choosing numbers with decimal points or fractions. , This trick is a good one to start with, as its one of the simplest. There's just enough substance to make it impressive however, so take the following steps and get them wondering how you knew it:


Tell him to multiply their number by 2.
Ask him to multiply the new number by 5.
Have him divide their current number by their original number.
Instruct him to subtract 7 from their current number.
""Guess"" the answer! If the prior steps were done correctly, the right answer will always be 3.
Witness as the fabric of their reality crashes down around them.


For example, if your friend chooses 3: 3x2=6. 6x5=30. 30/3=10. 10-7=3.

, This one's a little more complicated, but it's a perfect way to keep impressing your friend. This time, you'll have to choose a number too, so have an even number in mind before you begin. Once your friend has chosen a number, follow these steps:


Tell him to multiply the chosen number by 2.
Choose an even number to use yourself. Ask your friend to add this number to the one in his head.
Tell him to divide the new number by 2.
Tell him to subtract his original number from the equation.
""Guess"" the number. This time around, the right answer will be half the even number you chose.


For example, if you choose 10, and your friend chooses 3, here's how the equation will go down: 3x2=6. 6+10=16. 16/2=8. 8-3=5. 5 is half of 10!

, This is a great trick that operates on the unique property of multiples of 9. It's very important the number your friend chooses is between 1-10. Once your friend has picked a number, here's how to do it:


Tell your friend to multiply his number by 9.
Tell him/her to add the first and second digit of his number together. If it's a single digit number (i.e. 9), add 0.
Get your friend to add 4 to his new number.
""Guess"" the answer. Each and every time, the answer will be 13.
Watch as they begin to question everything they once held close and dear.


If your friend chooses 3, here's how the equation will unfold: 3x9=27. 2+7=9. 9+4=13.

, Giving your tricks a confident, theatrical presentation will make it more enjoyable for everyone.


A magician's costume isn't necessary, but it might be handy in giving the impression you're imbued with magical powers.

, The core mechanic in a lot of these tricks is getting your friend to eventually subtract his given number from the equation. Once the variable is out of the way, you have full control over where the equation goes. , The reason why the ""Lucky Number 13"" trick works so well is because multiples of 9 between 1-10 operate under in a uniquely identifiable way. In the case, each answer (e.g. 9, 18, 27 etc.) will equal to 9 if you add each digit together. Although this property is unique to multiples of 9, it makes a great trick, especially if your friend was quick to catch onto the fact that other tricks are quick to discard the original number.

, For instance the ""End With 3"" trick can be rearranged to end with any number.

, Once you've had some time getting used to mathematical mind tricks, you might be ready to try crafting your own. While they can become as infinitely complex as you want, it's a good thing to start out small, and slowly work your way up. For starters, use the ""End With 3"" as a template, and change the values of the constants to make a new equation. From there on, you'll be able to create new and inventive ways of ultimately removing the variable. Don't forget to consistently develop your presentation as well. People want to be entertained, and the way you baffle them with your trick is going to be just as important as the trick itself!

Understand the idea of decimal places.,
Find the decimal place you need to round to.,
Look at the number in the space to the right.,
If this number is greater than or equal to five, round up.,
If this number is less than five, round down.,
Use the same technique to round to a whole number.,

Round 45.783 to the nearest hundredth.,
Round 6.2979 to the third decimal place.,
Round 11.90 to the nearest tenth.,
Round -8.7 to the nearest whole number.",How to Round Decimals," In any number, the different digits represent different amounts. For instance, in the number 1,872, the ""1"" represents thousands, the ""8"" represents hundreds, the ""7"" represents tens, and the ""2"" represents ones. When there is a decimal point in a number, the numbers to the right of the point represent fractions of one.


The places to the right of the decimal point have names that mirror the names of the whole number decimal places. The first number to the right of the decimal point represents tenths, the second represents hundredths, the third represents thousandths, and so on for ten-thousandths, etc.For example, in the number 2.37589, ""2"" is the number of ones, ""3"" is the number of tenths, ""7"" is the number of hundredths, ""5"" is the number of thousandths, ""8"" is the number of ten-thousandths, and ""9"" is the number of hundred-thousandths.;
, The first step to rounding a decimal is to determine which decimal place you're going to round it to. If you're doing schoolwork, this information is usually given to you — often, the problem will say something like, ""round the answer to the nearest tenth/hundredth/thousandth.""


For example, if you are asked to round to the nearest thousandth in the number 12.9889, you would start by finding the thousandths place. Counting from the decimal point, the spaces to the right represent tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and ten-thousandths, so the second ""8"" (12.9889) is the one you want.
Sometimes, instructions will tell you exactly which decimal place to round to (e.g., ""round to the third decimal place"" means the same thing as ""round to the nearest thousandth"").

, Now, find the decimal place to the right of the place you're rounding to. Based on the number in this place, you'll round either up or down.


In our example number (12.9889), you're rounding to the thousandths place (12.9889), so now look at the number to the right of this, which is the final ""9"" (12.9889).

, To be clear: if the place you're rounding to is followed by a 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, round it up. In other words, make that decimal place one value greater and get rid of the digits after it.


In the example number (12.9889), since the final 9 is higher than 5, round your thousandths place up. The rounded value becomes 12.989. Note that you drop the digits after the rounded decimal place.

, On the other hand, if the place you're rounding to is followed by a 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, round it down. This means to leave the rounded digit as it is and get rid of the digits after it.


You wouldn't round 12.9889 down because the final 9 isn't 4 or lower. However, if you were working with the number 12.9884, you could round it down to 12.988.
Does this process seem familiar? If so, it's because this is basically how you round whole numbers — the decimal point doesn't change things.

, One common rounding task is to round a number to the nearest whole number (sometimes, this will be explained as ""rounding the number to the ones place""). In this case, use the same rounding technique as before.


In other words, start at the ones place, then look at the number to the right. If this number is 5 or greater, round up. If it is 4 or lower, round down. The decimal point in the middle doesn't change anything.
For example, if you needed to round the example number from earlier (12.9889) to the nearest whole number, you'd start by looking at the ones place: 12.9889. Since the ""9"" to the right is greater than 5, you would round up to 13. Since you've gotten a whole number answer, you don't need the decimal point any more.

, The directions for rounding above will work well in general. However, when you've been given special directions for rounding decimal places, make sure to follow them before you use the normal rounding rules.


For example, if you receive the instructions ""Round 4.59 down to the nearest tenth"", you'd round the 5 in the tenths place down even though the 9 to the right means you'd normally round it up. This would give you 4.5.
Similarly, if you are told to ""round 180.1 up to the nearest whole number,"" you'd round to 181 even though you'd normally round down.

, See below for the solution.


First, find the hundredths place. This is two spaces to the right of the decimal point, or 45.783.
Then, look at the number to the right: 45.783

Since 3 is less than 5, round down. This gives an answer of 45.78.

, Remember that ""third decimal place"" means to count three spaces to the right of the decimal point. This is the same thing as saying ""thousandths place."" See below for the solution:


Find the third decimal place. This is 6.2979.
Look at the number to the right. This is 6.2979.
Since 9 is greater than 5, round up. This gives an answer of 6.298.

, The ""0"" here makes this one a little tricky, but remember that zeroes count as numbers less than four. See below for the solution:


Find the tenths place. This is 11.90.
Look at the number to the right. This is 11.90.
Since 0 is less than 5, round down. This gives an answer of 11.9.

, Don't be intimidated by the negative sign — rounding negative numbers works exactly the same way as rounding positive numbers.


Find the ones place. This is -8.7
Look at the number to the right. This is -8.7.
Since 7 is greater than 5, round up. This gives an answer of -9. Leave the negative sign as-is.

Remember the F-O-I-L rule.,
Apply the FOIL rule to complex number multiplication.,
Combine the terms.,
Simplify by combining like terms.,
Work through one more example.",How to Simplify Complex Numbers2," Looking at a complex number (a+bi) should remind you of binomials from Algebra or Algebra 2. Remember that to multiply binomials, you need to multiply each term of the first binomial by each term of the second. A shorthand version for doing this, is the F-O-I-L rule, which stands for “First, Outer, Inner, Last.” For an example of (a+b)(c+d), apply this rule as follows:First. The F in FOIL means that you multiply the the first term of the first binomial by the first term of the second binomial. For the sample, this would be a*c.

Outer. The O in FOIL tells you to multiply the “outer” terms. These are the first term of the first binomial and the second term of the second binomial. For the sample, this would be a*d.

Inner. The I in FOIL means to multiply the “inner” terms. These would be the two terms that appear in the middle, which are the second term of the first binomial and the first term of the second binomial. In the given example, the inner terms are b*c.

Last. The L in FOIL represents the last terms of each binomial. For the sample expression, this would be b*d.

Finally, add all four products together. The result for the sample binomial multiplication of (a+b)(c+d) is ac+ad+bc+bd.


, To multiply two complex numbers, set them up as the product of two binomials and apply the FOIL rule. For example, the product of the two complex numbers (3+2i)*(5-3i) works as follows:First. The product of the first terms is 3*5=15.

Outer. The product of the outer terms is 3*(-3i). This product is -9i.

Inner. The product of the two inner terms is 2i*5. This product is 10i.

Last. The product of the last terms is (2i)*(-3i). This product is -6i2. Recognize that i2 equals -1, so the value of -6i2 is -6*-1, which is 6.


, After applying the FOIL rule and finding the four independent products, combine them together to find the result of the multiplication. For the sample (3+2i)*(5-3i), the parts combine to give 15-9i+10i+6., The result of the FOIL rule multiplication should yield two real number terms and two imaginary number terms. Simplify the result by combining like terms together.For the sample 15-9i+10i+6, you can add the 15 and 6 together and add the -9i and the 10i together. The result will be 21+i.


, Find the product of the two complex numbers (3+4i)(-2-5i). The steps for this multiplication are:(3)(-2)=-6     (First)

(3)(-5i)=-15i    (Outer)

(4i)(-2)=-8i    (Inner)

(4i)(-5i)=-20i2=(-20)(-1)=20    (Lasts)

-6-15i-8i+20 = 14-23i    (Combine terms and simplify)

Write the division of two complex numbers as a fraction.,
Find the conjugate of the denominator.,
Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.,
Return to complex number format.",How to Simplify Complex Numbers3," When you want to divide two complex numbers, set up the problem as a fraction. For example, to find the quotient of (4+3i) divided by (2-2i), set up the problem as follows:(4+3i)(2−2i){\displaystyle {\frac {(4+3i)}{(2-2i)}}}


, The conjugate of a complex number is a useful tool. It is simply created by changing the sign in the middle of the complex number. Thus, the conjugate of (a+bi) is (a-bi). The conjugate of (2-3i) is (2+3i).
, Whenever you multiply by a fraction whose numerator and denominator are identical, the value is just 1. This is a useful tool for simplifying complex numbers, particularly for division problems. Thus, set up the example (4+3i)(2−2i){\displaystyle {\frac {(4+3i)}{(2-2i)}}} as follows:(4+3i)(2−2i)∗(2+2i)(2+2i){\displaystyle {\frac {(4+3i)}{(2-2i)}}*{\frac {(2+2i)}{(2+2i)}}}

Then multiply the numerator and denominator and simplify as follows:


(4+3i)(2−2i)∗(2+2i)(2+2i){\displaystyle {\frac {(4+3i)}{(2-2i)}}*{\frac {(2+2i)}{(2+2i)}}}


8+8i+6i+6i24+4i−4i−4i2{\displaystyle {\frac {8+8i+6i+6i^{2}}{4+4i-4i-4i^{2}}}}


8+14i+6(−1)4−4(−1){\displaystyle {\frac {8+14i+6(-1)}{4-4(-1)}}}


8+14i−64+4{\displaystyle {\frac {8+14i-6}{4+4}}}


2+14i8{\displaystyle {\frac {2+14i}{8}}}



Notice in the second step above, the denominator contains the terms +4i{\displaystyle +4i} and −4i{\displaystyle -4i}. These will cancel each other out. This will always happen as a result of multiplying by the conjugate. The imaginary terms of the denominator should always cancel and disappear.

Look at the ratio.,
Factor out both terms.,
Find the greatest common factor.,
Divide both sides by the greatest common factor.,
Factor out the variable, if possible.,
Note your true greatest common factor.,
Write your final answer.",How to Simplify a Ratio2," This type of ratio still compares two quantities, but variables are introduced into the quantities on one or both sides. You will need to simplify both the numerical terms and the variables when figuring out this ratio's simplified form.



Example: 18x2:72x

, Remember that factors are whole numbers which divide evenly into a given quantity. Look at the numerical values on both sides of the ratio. Write out all factors for both numerical terms in separate lists.



Example: To solve this problem, you will need to find the factors of 18 and 72.

The factors of 18 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
The factors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72



, Go through both factor lists and circle, underline, or otherwise identify all of the factors shared between both lists. From this new selection of numbers, identify the highest number. This value is your greatest common factor (GCF) between the numerical terms. Note, however, that this value only represents a partial portion of your true GCF within the ratio.



Example: Both 18 and 72 share several factors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Of these factors, 18 is the greatest.

, You should be able to evenly divide both numerical terms in your ratio by the GCF. Do so now, and write down the whole numbers that you get as a result. These numbers will be used in your final simplified ratio.



Example: Both 18 and 72 must be divided by a factor of 18.

18 / 18 = 1
72 / 18 = 4



, Look at the variable on both sides of the ratio. If the same variable appears on both sides of the ratio, it can be factored out.


Look at the power the variable is raised to on both sides. The smaller power must be subtracted from the larger one. Understand that by subtracting one power from the other, you are essentially dividing the larger variable amount by the smaller one.

Example: When examined separately the ratio of variables was: x2:x

You can factor out an x from both sides. The power of the first x is 2, and the power of the second x is 1. As such, one x can be factored out from both sides, the first term will be left with one x, and the second term will be left with no x.
x * (x:1)
x:1



, Combine the GCF of your numerical values with the GCF of your variables to find your true GCF. This true GCF is the term that must be factored out of your entire ratio.



Example: Your greatest common factor for this problem is 18x.

18x * (x:4)



, After you remove your GCF, the remaining ratio is the simplified form of your original problem. This new ratio should be equivalent in proportion to the original and the terms on both sides of the ratio must not share any common factors with each other.



Example: x:4

"
"
Look at the ratio.,
Separate the first quantity into factors.,
Split the second quantity into factors.,
Cancel out common factors.Compare the two factored forms of your original expressions.,
Write your final answer.",How to Simplify a Ratio3," Polynomial ratios are more complex than other ratio types. There are still two quantities being compared, but the factors of those quantities are not as obvious and the problem may take slightly longer to solve. Nonetheless, the basic principle and steps remain the same.



Example: (9x2 - 8x + 15) : (x2 + 5x - 10)

, You'll need to factor out the polynomial of the first quantity. There are multiple methods you can use to complete this step, so you will need to use your knowledge of quadratic equations and other complex polynomials to determine the best method to use.



Example: For this problem, you can use the decomposition method of factorization.

x2 - 8x + 15
Multiply the a and c terms together: 1 * 15 = 15
Find two numbers that equal this number when multiplied and add up to the value of the b term: -5, -3 Substitute these two numbers into the original equation: x2 - 5x - 3x + 15
Factor by grouping: (x - 3) * (x - 5)



, The second quantity of the ratio must be broken down into factors, as well.



Example: Use any method desired to break down the second expression into factors:
x2 + 5x - 10

(x - 5) * (x + 2)



, Note that a factor, in this application, is any expression set in parentheses. If any of the parenthetical factors are the same between the two sides of your ratio, those factors can be canceled out.



Example: The factored form of the ratio is written as: : The common factor between the numerator and denominator is: (x-5)
When the common factor is removed, the ratio can be rewritten as: (x-5)*, The final ratio should contain no additional like factors and should be equivalent in proportion to the original ratio.



Example: (x – 3) : (x + 2)

Learn the basic value of each digit.,
Use a mnemonic.,
Add numbers with larger digits first.,
Treat numbers with smaller digits first as subtraction.,
Break a number into parts to understand it.,
Look for a horizontal bar for very large numbers.",How to Read Roman Numerals1," There are only a few Roman numerals, so it doesn't take long to learn them:


I = 1
V = 5
X = 10
L = 50
C = 100
D = 500
M = 1000;
, A mnemonic is a phrase that you can memorize more easily than a list of numbers, that will help you remember the order of the digits. Try repeating this one to yourself ten times:



I Value Xylophones Like Cows Do Milk., If the digits are ordered largest to smallest, all you need to do to read them is add the value of each digit. Here are some examples:


VI = 5 + 1 = 6
LXI = 50 + 10 + 1 = 61
III = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

, Most people who use Roman numerals save space by using subtraction to show certain numbers. You'll know this is happening if a smaller digit is in front of a larger digit. This only happens in a few situations:


IV = 1 subtracted from 5 = 5 - 1 = 4
IX = 1 subtracted from 10 = 10 - 1 = 9
XL = 10 subtracted from 50 = 50 - 10 = 40
XC = 10 subtracted from 100 = 100 - 10 = 90
CM = 100 subtracted from 1000 = 1000 - 100 = 900

, If you need to, divide a number into groups of digits to understand it better. Always make sure you catch any ""subtraction problems"" with a smaller digit in front of a larger, and include both the digits into the same group.


For example, try to read DCCXCIX.
There are two places in the number with a small digit in front of a larger one: XC and IX.
Keep the ""subtraction problems"" together and break up the other digits separately: D + C + C + XC + IX.
Translate into ordinary numerals using the subtraction rules when necessary: 500 + 100 + 100 + 90 + 9
Add them all together: DCCXCIX = 799.

, If a horizontal line is drawn across the top of a number, multiply the value by 1,000.Be careful, though: many people draw a horizontal line above and below every roman numeral, just as decoration.


For example, an X with a ""–"" written over it means 10,000.
If you're not sure whether the bar is just decoration, think about the context. Would a general send in 10 soldiers, or 10,000? Would a recipe use 5 apples, or 5,000?

Determine whether you are reading a semi-log or log-log graph.,
Read the scale of the main divisions.,
Notice that the minor intervals are not evenly spaced.",How to Read a Logarithmic Scale1," Graphs that represent rapidly growing data can use one-log scales or two-log scales. The difference is in whether both the x-axis and y-axis use logarithmic scales, or only one.The choice depends on the amount of detail that you wish to display with your graph. If numbers on one axis or the other grow or decrease exponentially, you may wish to use a logarithmic scale for that axis.

A logarithmic (or just “log”) scale has unevenly spaced grid lines. A standard scale has evenly spaced grid lines. Some data needs to be graphed on standard paper only, some on semi-log graphs, and some on log-log graphs.

For example, the graph of y=x{\displaystyle y={\sqrt {x}}} (or any similar function with a radical term) can be graphed on a purely standard graph, a semi-log graph, or log-log graph. On a standard graph, the function appears as a sideways parabola, but the detail for very small numbers is difficult to see. On the log-log graph, the same function appears as a straight line, and the values are more spread out for better detail.If both variables in a study include great ranges of data, you would probably use a log-log graph. Studies of evolutionary effects, for example, may be measured in thousands or millions of years and might choose a logarithmic scale for the x-axis. Depending on the item being measured, a log-log scale may be necessary.
;
, On a logarithmic scale graph, the evenly spaced marks represent the powers of whatever base you are working with. The standard logarithms use either base 10 or the natural logarithm which uses the base e{\displaystyle e}.


e{\displaystyle e} is a mathematical constant that is useful in working with compound interest and other advanced calculations. It is approximately equal to 2.718.This article will focus on the base-10 logarithms, but the reading the natural logarithm scale operates in the same way.

Standard logarithms use base 10. Instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4… or 10, 20, 30, 40… or some other evenly spaced scale, a logarithm scale counts by powers of 10. The main axis points are, therefore, 101,102,103,104{\displaystyle 10^{1},10^{2},10^{3},10^{4}} and so on.Each of the main divisions, usually noted on log paper with a darker line, is called a “cycle.” When specifically using based 10, you can use the term “decade” because it refers to a new power of 10.


, If you are using printed logarithmic graph paper, you will notice that the intervals between the main units are not evenly spaced. That is, for example, the mark for 20 would actually be placed about 1/3 of the way between 10 and 100.The minor interval marks are based on the logarithm of each number. Therefore, if 10 is represented as the first major mark on the scale, and 100 is the second, the other numbers fall in between as follows:


log(10)=1{\displaystyle log(10)=1}


log(20)=1.3{\displaystyle log(20)=1.3}


log(30)=1.48{\displaystyle log(30)=1.48}


log(40)=1.60{\displaystyle log(40)=1.60}


log(50)=1.70{\displaystyle log(50)=1.70}


log(60)=1.78{\displaystyle log(60)=1.78}


log(70)=1.85{\displaystyle log(70)=1.85}


log(80)=1.90{\displaystyle log(80)=1.90}


log(90)=1.95{\displaystyle log(90)=1.95}


log(100)=2.00{\displaystyle log(100)=2.00}



At higher powers of 10, the minor intervals are spaced in the same ratios. Thus, the spacing between 10, 20, 30… looks like the spacing between 100, 200, 300… or 1000, 2000, 3000….

Remember that any number multiplied by 1 is the number itself.,

Start simple and work your way up.,

Subtract 1 from the single digit you've chosen to multiply time 9 (starting with 2).,

Subtract the first digit of your answer from 9.,

Put your numbers together.,

Calculate other single multiplication problems with 9 with this method and you'll be able to solve them in your head in no time!
",How to Quickly Multiply Single Digits by 91," No matter how tricky 9 is, it can't escape the fact that 1x9 will always equal 9.
, Don't try to multiply 9x9 before you learn 9x2 because it is a lot easier to think of math like a ladder. You should take each step to the top because if you try to skip steps you may just fall back and have to start over., When you subtract one from your digit, you will have the first digit in the product. For example, when you want to know the product of 9x2, subtract 1 from 2 and you will know your answer starts with a 1., If you subtract the first number in your product from 9 you will get the second number in your product. We found out the first number in the product of 9x2 is 1 by subtracting 1 from 2 and 9-1=8., You found the first digit of your answer to be 1 and then your next to be 8. This means the product of 9x2 is 18.

Note that the sum of the digits always equals 9. Even with multiplying 9 by numbers higher than ten, if you add all the digits in a multiple of 9, and then add the digits again if there are more than one, and so on, you will always eventually end up with 9. For example, 9 x 15,873 is equal to 142,857. Add the digits of this number together, and get 27. Add the digits of this together and you will end up with 9.

Factor out the two.,
Test it on an example.",How to Find the Surface Area of a Rectangular Prism," Each rectangular prism has a length, a width, and a height. Draw a picture of the prism, and write the symbols l, w, and h next to three different edges of the shape.


If you're not sure which sides to label, pick any corner. Label the three lines that meet at that corner.
For example: A box has a base that measures 3 inches by 4 inches, and it stands 5 inches tall. The long side of the base is 4 inches, so l = 4, w = 3, and h = 5.

, To cover the whole surface area, you'd need to paint six different ""faces."" Think about each one — or find a box of cereal and look at them directly:


There are a top and bottom face. Both are the same size.There are a front and a back face. Both are the same size.
There are a left and right face. Both are the same size.
If you have trouble picturing this, cut a box apart along the edges and lay it out., To start out, let's find the surface area of just one face: the bottom. This is a rectangle, just like every face. One edge of the rectangle is labeled length and the other is labeled width. To find the area of the rectangle, just multiply the two edges together. Area (bottom edge) = length times width = lw.


Going back to our example, the area of the bottom face is 4 inches x 3 inches = 12 square inches.

, Wait a second — we already noticed that the top and bottom faces are the same size. This must also have an area of lw.


In our example, the top area is also 12 square inches.

, Go back to your diagram and look at the front face: the one with one edge labeled width and one labeled height. The area of the front face = width times height = wh. The area of the back is also wh.


In our example, w = 3 inches and h = 5 inches, so the area of the front is 3 inches x 5 inches =15 square inches. The area of the back face is also 15 square inches.

, We've just got two faces left, each the same size. One edge is the length of the prism, and one edge is the height of the prism. The area of the left face is lh and the area of the right face is also lh.


In our example, l = 4 inches and h = 5 inches, so the area of the left face = 4 inches x 5 inches = 20 square inches. The area of the right face is also 20 square inches.

, Now you've found the area of each of the six faces. Add them all together to get the area of the whole shape: lw + lw + wh + wh + lh + lh. You can use this formula for any rectangular prism, and you will always get the surface area.


To finish our example, just add up all the blue numbers above: 12 + 12 + 15 + 15 + 20 + 20 = 94 square inches.

, You now know enough to find the surface area of any rectangular prism. You can do it faster if you've learned some basic algebra. Start with our equation above: Area of a rectangular prism = lw + lw + wh + wh + lh + lh. If we combine all the terms that are the same, we get:


Area of a rectangular prism = 2lw + 2wh + 2lh


, If you know how to factor in algebra, you can make it even shorter:


Area of a Rectangular Prism = 2lw + 2wh + 2lh = 2(lw + wh + lh).

, Let's go back to our example box, with length 4, width 3, and height 5. Plug these numbers into the formula:


Area = 2(lw + wh + lh) = 2 x (lw + wh + lh) = 2 x (4x3 + 3x5 + 4x5) = 2 x (12 + 15 + 20) = 2 x (47) = 94 square inches. That's the same answer we got before. Once you've practiced doing these equations, this is a much faster way to find the surface area.

3 = III
4 = IV or IIII
5 = V
6 = VI
7 = VII

Use this section only for old text.,
Read unusual repetitions.,
Look for signs of multiplication.,
Understand variations of I.,
Read large numbers with unusual symbols.",How to Read Roman Numerals3," Roman numerals were not standardized until modern times. Even the Romans themselves used them inconsistently, and all sorts of variations were used into medieval times and even the 19th and early 20th centuries. If you come across an old text with numerals that don't make sense in the usual system, refer to the steps below for help interpreting it.If you're learning Roman numerals for the first time, ignore this section.

, Most modern users don't like to repeat the same digit if they can avoid it, and never subtracted more than one digit at a time. Old sources didn't obey these rules, but it's usually easy to figure out what they meant. For example:


VV = 5 + 5 = 10
XXC = (10 + 10) subtracted from 100 = 100 - 20 = 80

, Confusingly, old texts sometimes use the smaller digit in front of the larger to mean multiplication, not subtraction. For example, VM might mean 5 x 1000 = 5000. There's not always an easy way to tell when this is happening, but sometimes the number is slightly altered:


A period between the two numbers: VI.C = 6 x 100 = 600.
A subscript: IVM = 4 x 1000 = 4000.

, In old printed works, the symbol j or J is sometimes used instead of i or I at the end of a number. More rarely, an extra tall I at the end of a word can signify 2 instead of 1.


For example, xvi or XVJ, both equal 16.
xvI = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17

, Early printers sometimes used a symbol called the apostrophus, similar to a backwards C or a ) symbol. This and variations of it were only used for large numbers:


M was sometimes written as CI) or ∞ by early printers, or as a ϕ in ancient Rome.
D was sometimes written as I)
Enclosing the above numbers inside additional ( and ) symbols meant multiplication by ten. For example, (CI)) = 10,000 and ((CI))) = 100,000.

Determine the type of scale you wish to use.,
Mark the x-axis scale.,
Determine that you need a logarithmic scale for the y-axis.,
Label the logarithmic scale.,
Find the position on the x-axis for a data point.,
Locate the position along the logarithmic scale y-axis.,
Continue with all the data.",How to Read a Logarithmic Scale2," For the explanation given below, the focus will be on a semi-log graph, using a standard scale for the x-axis and a log scale for the y-axis. However, you may wish to reverse these, depending on how you want the data to appear. Reversing the axes has the effect of shifting the graph by ninety degrees and may make the data more easily interpreted in one direction or the other. Additionally, you may wish to use a log scale to spread out certain data values and make their details more visible., The x-axis is the independent variable. The independent variable is the one that you generally control in a measurement or experiment. The independent variable is not affected by the other variable in the study. Some examples of independent variables may be such things as:Date

Time

Age

Medication given


, You will use a logarithmic scale to graph data that changes extremely quickly. A standard graph is useful for data that grows or decreases at a linear rate. A logarithmic graph is for data that changes at an exponential rate. Samples of such data might be:

Population growth rates

Product consumption rates

Compounding interest


, Review your data and decide how to mark the y-axis. If your data measures numbers only within, for example, the millions and billions, you probably do not need to have your graph begin at 0. You could label the lowest cycle on the graph as 106{\displaystyle 10^{6}}. Subsequent cycles would be 107,108,109{\displaystyle 10^{7},10^{8},10^{9}} and so on.
, To graph the first (or any) data point, you begin by finding its position along the x-axis. This may be an incremental scale, such as a regular number line that counts 1, 2, 3, and so on. It may be a scale of labels that you assign, such as dates or months of the year when you take certain measurements.
, You need to find the corresponding position along the y-axis for the data that you wish to plot. Recall that, since you are working with a logarithmic scale, the major markings are powers of 10, and the minor scale markings in between represent the subdivisions. For example, between 106{\displaystyle 10^{6}} (one million) and 107{\displaystyle 10^{7}} (ten million), the lines represent divisions of 1,000,000’s.For example, the number 4,000,000 would be graphed at the fourth minor scale mark above 106{\displaystyle 10^{6}}. Even though, on a standard linear scale, 4,000,000 is less than halfway between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000, because of the logarithmic scale, it actually appears slightly more than halfway.

You should note that the higher intervals, closer to the upper limit, become squeezed together. This is due to the mathematical nature of the logarithmic scale.


, Continue repeating the previous steps for all the data that you need to graph. For each data point, first locate its position along the x-axis, and then find its corresponding location along the logarithmic scale of the y-axis.

Find the range on the graph.",How to Find the Range of a Function in Math1," Let's say the formula you're working with is the following: f(x) = 3x2 + 6x -2. This means that when you place any x into the equation, you'll get your y value. This is the function of a parabola.;
, If you're working with a straight line or any function with a polynomial of an odd number, such as f(x) = 6x3+2x + 7, you can skip this step. But if you're working with a parabola, or any equation where the x-coordinate is squared or raised to an even power, you'll need to plot the vertex. To do this, just use the formula -b/2a to get the x coordinate of the function 3x2 + 6x -2, where 3 = a, 6 = b, and -2 = c. In this case -b is -6, and 2a is 6, so the x-coordinate is -6/6, or -1.Now, plug -1 into the function to get the y-coordinate. f(-1) = 3(-1)2 + 6(-1) -2 = 3 - 6 -2 = -5.
The vertex is (-1,-5). Graph it by drawing a point where the x coordinate is -1 and where the y-coordinate is -5. It should be in the third quadrant of the graph.

, To get a sense of the function, you should plug in a few other x-coordinates so you can get a sense of what the function looks like before you start to look for the range. Since it's a parabola and the x2 coordinate is positive, it'll be pointing upward. But just to cover your bases, let's plug in some x-coordinates to see what y coordinates they yield:


f(-2) = 3(-2)2 + 6(-2) -2 = -2. One point on the graph is (-2, -2)
f(0) = 3(0)2 + 6(0) -2 = -2. Another point on the graph is (0,-2)
f(1) = 3(1)2 + 6(1) -2 = 7. A third point on the graph is (1, 7).

, Now, look at the y-coordinates on the graph and find the lowest point at which the graph touches a y-coordinate. In this case, the lowest y-coordinate is at the vertex, -5, and the graph extends infinitely above this point. This means that the range of the function is y = all real numbers ≥ -5.

, Anonymous functions are not stored to any program file. They can accept multiple inputs and return outputs. You must know what function you want to graph because you need to let MATLAB know what independent variables your function has before you write the function. Some examples of anonymous functions include:

Trigonometric functions
Rational functions
Polynomials
Logarithmic functions

, You will want to know what interval you want your function to be graphed on because it is entered before you graph the function. It is a good idea to know your interval before you begin typing. Intervals always have lower and upper bounds. Entering the interval will be explained later., This is where you will place individual statements. Inside the command window you can assign values to variables, assign functions to variables, plot functions etc., The first thing you will begin to type is the name of the function. Typical names for functions are “f” and “g”. However, you can name the function anything that you want. The name of the function must start with a letter. It should not contain any special characters. It may contain numbers as long as the first character is a letter., Directly after the function you will set up the independent variables. You do this by putting an equal sign “=” after the function name. Then put a space and an “@”. Immediately after the “@” you will put an open parenthesis “(“. Now you can start listing all the of the independent variables. If your independent variable is “x”, it should look like this: “@(x)”. If you wish to have more independent variables, then you put a comma after each variable. For example, @(x,y)., After you set up the independent variables you can type the function. It is a good idea to put a space in between them so your code looks neat. Here are some basic tips to help type functions in MATLAB.

Cosine- cos(x)
Sine-sin(x)
Tangent-tan(x)
Cosine(in degrees)-cosd(x)
Sine(in degrees)-sind(x)
Tangent(in degrees)-tand(x)
Multiplication- “2*x”
Division- “2/x”
Addition- “2+x”
Subtraction- “2-x
Exponent- x^2
e- exp(x)
Example of how to type a polynomial - ""2*x^2+3*x+7""

, This saves the function to the variable. After you press enter, the function should come up on the next line. If you get an error, then you may have typed something in wrong., On the next line you will write a statement to plot the function. To plot an anonymous function, you must use “fplot” even if your function is not named ""f"". The proper syntax for fplot is: fplot(name of function, interval). So you will basically type in the name of the function first and then type in the interval. The interval is written . For example: fplot(f,). If you do not know the interval, then you can just put “fplot(f)”. MATLAB will pick the interval. After you type this, then you will press enter again.

, Make sure you click back in the command window. Do not exit out of the graph. If you exit out of the graph, then you will not be able to add to the graph.

, After each time you label an axes or the title, you will hit ↵ Enter. Each time, the graph window will change. Make sure your cursor is still in the command window. Here is how you give a name to each:

x-axis: xlabel(‘name’)
y-axis: ylabel(‘name’)
title:title(‘name’).

However, you do need to know the length of all the sides of the shape.For example, a pentagon has five sides, and you need to know the length of each one to determine perimeter.
Even with an irregular polygon that has 20 sides, you can still find the perimeter as long as you know the length of each side.;
, To find the perimeter of non-circular objects, find the sum of all the side lengths to determine the distance around the shape.Say the irregular pentagon has the following lengths: A = 4, B =2, C = 3, D = 3, and E = 2
Add 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 14, where P (perimeter) = 14

, You can still find perimeter when you are working with variables. For example, say you have a triangle with the side lengths 14a, 11b, and 7a:Find the sum of all the sides: P = 14a + 11b + 7a
Combine the like terms: P = (14a + 7a) + 11b
P = 21a + 11b

, In a real world application, finding the perimeter of an object won’t do you much good if you don’t know what unit of measurement you’re working with (such as feet, miles, or meters). With the pentagon, if each side was measured in centimeters, then you know that P = 14 cm.

, Some regular shapes have formulas that make it faster for you to find the figure’s perimeter. But there are other shapes, like circles, that require a formula to find perimeter. The perimeter of a circle is called the circumference. To find the circumference of a circle, use the equation C (circumference) = 2πr.To start, find the radius of the circle, which is the length of a line segment running from the center of the circle to the perimeter.
For simpler equations, use the truncated version π = 3.14
For a circle with a radius of 4cm: C = 2 x 3.14 x 4 = 25.12cm

, Use the equation P = a + b + c for a triangle. For instance, if a triangle has the dimensions a = 20cm, b = 11cm, and c = 9cm, then P = 20 + 11 + 9 = 40cm.

, Because a square has four sides of the same length, you can use the simple equation P = 4x, where x equals the length of one side.


On a square where x = 3cm, then P = 4 x 3 = 12cm

, Since the lengthwise sides are the same and the widthwise sides are the same on a rectangle, you can use the equation P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length of one side and w is the width of one side. For a rectangle where l = 8cm and w = 5cm:


P = (2 x 8) + (2 x 5)
P = 16 + 10
P = 26cm
The equation P = 2(l + h) will also give you the same result: 2(8 + 5) = 2(13) = 26cm, A quadrilateral refers to any two-dimensional shape with four closed, straight sides. This includes rectangles, squares, trapezoids, parallelograms, kites, and rhombuses.There are three equations you can use for a quadrilateral, depending on the sides:


For a quadrilateral with no equal sides, like an irregular trapezoid, use the equation P = a + b + c + d
For a quadrilateral with four equal sides, use the same equation as a square: P = 4x.
For quadrilaterals where the lengthwise sides are the same and the widthwise sides are the same (like a rectangle), use the equations P = 2a + 2b or P = 2(a + b)

, Let's say the highest y-coordinate that the function reaches is 10. This function could also get larger and larger infinitely, so it doesn't have a set highest point -- just infinity.

, This means that the range of the function, or the range of y-coordinates, ranges from -3 to 10. So, -3 ≤ f(x) ≤ 10. That's the range of the function.


But let's say the graph reaches its lowest point at y = -3, but goes upward forever. Then the range is f(x) ≥ -3 and that's it.
Let's say the graph reaches its highest point at 10 but goes downward forever. Then the range is f(x) ≤ 10.

You can look at a relation and determine its domain and range. Let's say you're working with the following relation: {(2, –3), (4, 6), (3, –1), (6, 6), (2, 3)}., To find the range of the relation, simply write down all of the y-coordinates of each ordered pair: {-3, 6, -1, 6, 3}., You'll notice that you have listed ""6"" two times. Take it out so that you are left with {-3, -1, 6, 3}., Now, reorder the numbers in the set so that you're moving from the smallest to the largest, and you have your range. The range of the relation {(2, –3), (4, 6), (3, –1), (6, 6), (2, 3)} is {-3,-1, 3, 6}. You're all done., For a relation to be a function, every time you put in one number of an x coordinate, the y coordinate has to be the same. For example, the relation {(2, 3) (2, 4) (6, 9)} is not a function, because when you put in 2 as an x the first time, you got a 3, but the second time you put in a 2, you got a four. For a relation to be a function, if you put in the same input, you should always get the same output. If you put in a -7, you should get the same y coordinate (whatever it may be) every single time."

Read the problem.,
Write the problem as a function.,
Determine the domain.,
Determine the range.",How to Find the Range of a Function in Math4," Let's say you're working with the following problem: ""Becky is selling tickets to her school's talent show for 5 dollars each. The amount of money she collects is a function of how many tickets she sells. What is the range of the function?""

, In this case, M represents the amount of money she collects, and t represents the amount of tickets she sells. However, since each ticket will cost 5 dollars, you'll have to multiply the amount of tickets sold by 5 to find the amount of money. Therefore, the function can be written as M(t) = 5t.


For example, if she sells 2 tickets, you'll have to multiply 2 by 5 to get 10, the amount of dollars she'll get.

, To determine the range, you must first find the domain. The domain is all of the possible values of t that work in the equation. In this case, Becky can sell 0 or more tickets - she can't sell negative tickets. Since we don't know the number of seats in her school auditorium, we can assume that she can theoretically sell an infinite number of tickets. And she can only sell whole tickets; she can't sell 1/2 of a ticket, for example. Therefore, the domain of the function is t = any non-negative integer.

, The range is the possible amount of money that Becky can make from her sale. You have to work with the domain to find the range. If you know that the domain is any non-negative integer and that the formula is M(t) = 5t, then you know that you can plug any non-negative integer into this function to get the output, or the range. For example, if she sells 5 tickets, then M(5) = 5 x 5, or 25 dollars. If she sells 100, then M(100) = 5 x 100, or 500 dollars. Therefore, the range of the function is any non-negative integer that is a multiple of five.


That means that any non-negative integer that is a multiple of five is a possible output for the input of the function.

, The midpoint formula can be used by adding the x-coordinates of the two endpoints and dividing the result by two and then adding the y-coordinates of the endpoints and dividing them by two. This is how you will find the average of the x and y coordinates of the endpoints.This is the formula: , You can't use the midpoint formula without knowing the x and y-coordinates of the endpoints. In this example, you want to find the midpoint, point O, which is between the two endpoints M (5,4) and N (3,-4). Therefore, (x1, y1) = (5, 4) and (x2, y2) = (3, -4).


Note that either pair of coordinates can serve as (x1, y1) or (x2, y2) -- since you'll just be adding the coordinates and dividing by two, it doesn't matter which pair is first.

, Now that you know the coordinates of the endpoints, you can plug them into the formula. Here's how you do it:

;
, These should be given, or you should be able to measure them. Make sure you are substituting for a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the width of a rectangle is 3 cm, and the length is 4 cm, your formula will look like this: 32+42=c2{\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}.


, Remember, squaring a number means to multiply the number by itself.

For example:32+42=c2{\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}9+16=c2{\displaystyle 9+16=c^{2}}25=c2{\displaystyle 25=c^{2}}


, The easiest way to find a square root is to use a calculator. You can use an online calculator if you do not have a scientific calculator.This will give you the value of c{\displaystyle c}, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the diagonal of the rectangle.

For example:25=c2{\displaystyle 25=c^{2}}25=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}5=c{\displaystyle 5=c}So, the diagonal of a rectangle with a width of 3 cm and a length of 4 cm is 5 cm.

Try a more difficult problem.",How to Find the Equation of a Tangent Line1," A graph makes it easier to follow the problem and check whether the answer makes sense. Sketch the function on a piece of graph paper, using a graphing calculator as a reference if necessary. Sketch the tangent line going through the given point. (Remember, the tangent line runs through that point and has the same slope as the graph at that point.)


Example 1: Sketch the graph of the parabola f(x)=0.5x2+3x−1{\displaystyle f(x)=0.5x^{2}+3x-1}. Draw the tangent going through point (-6, -1).You don't know the tangent's equation yet, but you can already tell that its slope is negative, and that its y-intercept is negative (well below the parabola vertex with y value -5.5). If your final answer doesn't match these details, you'll know to check your work for mistakes.
;
, For function f(x), the first derivative f'(x) represents the equation for the slope of the tangent line at any point on f(x). There are many ways to take derivatives. Here's a simple example using the power rule:Example 1 (cont.): The graph is described by the function f(x)=0.5x2+3x−1{\displaystyle f(x)=0.5x^{2}+3x-1}.Recall the power rule when taking derivatives: ddxxn=nxn−1{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}x^{n}=nx^{n-1}}.The function's first derivative = f'(x) = (2)(0.5)x + 3 - 0.f'(x) = x + 3. Plug any value a for x into this equation, and the result will be the slope of the line tangent to f(x) at the point were x = a.


, Read the problem to discover the coordinates of the point for which you're finding the tangent line. Enter the x-coordinate of this point into f'(x). The output is the slope of the tangent line at this point.


Example 1 (cont.): The point mentioned in the problem is (-6, -1). Use the x-coordinate -6 as the input for f'(x):f'(-6) = -6 + 3 = -3The slope of the tangent line is -3.


, The point-slope form of a linear equation is y−y1=m(x−x1){\displaystyle y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})}, where m is the slope and (x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} is a point on the line.You now have all the information you need to write the tangent line's equation in this form.


Example 1 (cont.): y−y1=m(x−x1){\displaystyle y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})}The slope of the line is -3, so y−y1=−3(x−x1){\displaystyle y-y_{1}=-3(x-x_{1})}The tangent line passes through (-6, -1), so the final equation is y−(−1)=−3(x−(−6)){\displaystyle y-(-1)=-3(x-(-6))}Simplify to y+1=−3x−18{\displaystyle y+1=-3x-18}y=−3x−19{\displaystyle y=-3x-19}


, If you have a graphing calculator, graph the original function and the tangent line to check that you have the correct answer. If working on paper, refer to your earlier graph to make sure there are no glaring mistakes in your answer.


Example 1 (cont.): The initial sketch showed that the slope of the tangent line was negative, and the y-intercept was well below -5.5. The tangent line equation we found is y = -3x - 19 in slope-intercept form, meaning -3 is the slope and -19 is the y-intercept. Both of these attributes match the initial predictions.


, Here's a run-through of the whole process again. This time, the goal is to find the line tangent to f(x)=x3+2x2+5x+1{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}+2x^{2}+5x+1} at x = 2:

Using the power rule, the first derivative f′(x)=3x2+4x+5{\displaystyle f'(x)=3x^{2}+4x+5}. This function will tell us the slope of the tangent.

Since x = 2, find f′(2)=3(2)2+4(2)+5=25{\displaystyle f'(2)=3(2)^{2}+4(2)+5=25}. This is the slope at x = 2.

Notice we do not have a point this time, only an x-coordinate. To find the y-coordinate, plug x = 2 into the initial function: f(2)=23+2(2)2+5(2)+1=27{\displaystyle f(2)=2^{3}+2(2)^{2}+5(2)+1=27}. The point is (2,27).

Write the tangent line equation in point-slope form: y−y1=m(x−x1){\displaystyle y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})}y−27=25(x−2){\displaystyle y-27=25(x-2)}If required, simplify to y = 25x - 23.

Find the smallest multiple the numbers have in common.",How to Find the Least Common Multiple of Two Numbers1," This method works best when you are working with two numbers that are less than 10. If you are working with larger numbers, it’s best to use a different method.

For example, you might need to find the least common multiple of 5 and 8. Since these are small numbers, it is appropriate to use this method.
;
, A multiple is a product of any number and an integer.In other words, they are the numbers you would see in a multiplication table.

For example, the first several multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.


, Do this near the first set of multiples, so that they are easy to compare.

For example, the first several multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64.


, You might need to extend your list of multiples until you find one both numbers share. This number will be your least common multiple.For example, the lowest multiple 5 and 8 share is 40, so the least common multiple of 5 and 8 is 40.

Find a vertical or horizontal line.,
Find the length of the segment.,
Divide the length of the segment by two.,
Count that value from either of the endpoints.",How to Find the Midpoint of a Line Segment2," Before you can use this method, you'll need to know how to locate a vertical or horizontal line. Here's how to spot it:A line is horizontal if the two y-coordinates of the endpoints are equal. For example, the line segment with the endpoints (-3, 4) and (5, 4) is horizontal.






A line is vertical if the two x-coordinates of the endpoints are equal. For example, the line segment with the endpoints (2, 0) and (2, 3) is vertical.







, You can easily find the length of the segment just by counting how many horizontal spaces it takes up if it's horizontal, and counting how many vertical spaces it takes up if it's vertical. Here's how to do it:


The horizontal line segment with the end points (-3, 4) and (5, 4) is 8 units long. You can find this by counting the spaces it takes up or by adding the absolute values of the x-coordinates: |-3| + |5| = 8






The vertical line segment with the end points (2, 0) and (2, 3) is 3 units long. You can find this by counting the spaces it takes up or by adding the absolute values of the y-coordinates: |0| + |3| = 3







, Now that you know the length of the line segment, you can divide it by two.


8/2 = 4






3/2 = 1.5







, This is the last step to finding the endpoint of the line segment. Here's how you do it:


To find the midpoint of the points (-3, 4) and (5, 4), just shift over 4 units either from the left or right to reach the middle of the segment. (-3, 4) shifted over 4 x-coordinates is (1, 4). You won't need to change the y-coordinates since you know the midpoint will be on the same y-coordinate as the endpoints. The midpoint of (-3, 4) and (5, 4) is (1, 4).






To find the midpoint of the points (2, 0) and (2, 3), just shift over 1.5 units either from the top or bottom to reach the middle of the segment. (2, 0) shifted up 1.5 y-coordinates is (2, 1.5). You won't need to change the x-coordinates since you know the midpoint will be on the same x-coordinate as the endpoints. The midpoint of (2, 0) and (2, 3) is (2, 1.5).

For example, if the area of the rectangle is 35 square centimeters, your formula will look like this: 35=lw{\displaystyle 35=lw}.


, To do this, divide both sides of the equation by l{\displaystyle l}. Set this value aside. You will plug it into the perimeter formula later.

For example:35=lw{\displaystyle 35=lw}35l=w{\displaystyle {\frac {35}{l}}=w}.


, The formula is P=2(w+l){\displaystyle P=2(w+l)}, where w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle, and l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle., Make sure you substitute for the variable P{\displaystyle P}.

For example, if the perimeter of a rectangle is 24 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 24=2(w+l){\displaystyle 24=2(w+l)}.


, This will give you the value of w+l{\displaystyle w+l}.

For example:24=2(w+l){\displaystyle 24=2(w+l)}242=2(w+l)2{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{2}}={\frac {2(w+l)}{2}}}12=w+l{\displaystyle 12=w+l}.


, Use the value you found by rearranging the formula for area.

For example, if using the area formula you found that 35l=w{\displaystyle {\frac {35}{l}}=w}, replace this value of w{\displaystyle w} into the perimeter formula:12=w+l{\displaystyle 12=w+l}12=35l+l{\displaystyle 12={\frac {35}{l}}+l}


, To do this, multiply both sides of the equation by l{\displaystyle l}.

For example:12=35l+l{\displaystyle 12={\frac {35}{l}}+l}12×l=(35l×l)+(l×l){\displaystyle 12\times l=({\frac {35}{l}}\times l)+(l\times l)}12l=35+l2{\displaystyle 12l=35+l^{2}}


, To do this, subtract the first-degree term from both sides of the equation.

For example:12l=35+l2{\displaystyle 12l=35+l^{2}}12l−12l=35+l2−12l{\displaystyle 12l-12l=35+l^{2}-12l}0=35+l2−12l{\displaystyle 0=35+l^{2}-12l}


, This means the term with the exponent will be first, followed by the term with the variable, followed by the constant. When reordering, make sure you keep the appropriate positive and negative signs. You should note that the equation is now set up as a quadratic equation.

For example, 0=35+l2−12l{\displaystyle 0=35+l^{2}-12l} becomes 0=l2−12l+35{\displaystyle 0=l^{2}-12l+35}.


, For complete instructions on how to do this, read Solve Quadratic Equations.

For example, the equation 0=l2−12l+35{\displaystyle 0=l^{2}-12l+35} can be factored as 0=(l−7)(l−5){\displaystyle 0=(l-7)(l-5)}.


, To do this, set each term to zero and solve for the variable. You will find two solutions, or roots, to the equation. Since you are working with a rectangle, the two roots will be the width and length of your rectangle.

For example:0=(l−7){\displaystyle 0=(l-7)}7=l{\displaystyle 7=l}AND0=(l−5){\displaystyle 0=(l-5)}5=l{\displaystyle 5=l}.So, the length and width of the rectangle are 7 cm and 5 cm.


, The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the side lengths of a right triangle, and c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of a right triangle’s hypotenuse.You use the Pythagorean Theorem because a diagonal of a rectangle cuts the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.The width and length of the rectangle are the side lengths of the triangle; the diagonal is the hypotenuse of the triangle.


, It doesn’t matter which value you use for which variable.

For example, if you found the width and length of the rectangle are 5 cm and 7 cm, your formula will look like this: 52+72=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+7^{2}=c^{2}}.


, Remember, squaring a number means to multiply the number by itself.

For example:52+72=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+7^{2}=c^{2}}25+49=c2{\displaystyle 25+49=c^{2}}74=c2{\displaystyle 74=c^{2}}


, The easiest way to find a square root is to use a calculator. You can use an online calculator if you do not have a scientific calculator.This will give you the value of c{\displaystyle c}, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the diagonal of the rectangle.

For example:74=c2{\displaystyle 74=c^{2}}74=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {74}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}8.6024=c{\displaystyle 8.6024=c}So, the diagonal of a rectangle with an area of 35 cm and a perimeter of 24 cm is about 8.6 cm.

For example, if you know the width of a rectangle is 2 cm more than the length, you can write a formula for w{\displaystyle w}: w=l+2{\displaystyle w=l+2}.


, The formula is A=lw{\displaystyle A=lw}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the rectangle, l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle, and w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle.You can use this method if you know the perimeter of the rectangle, except you would now set up the perimeter formula instead of the area formula. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P=2(w+l){\displaystyle P=2(w+l)}, where w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle, and l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle., Make sure you substitute for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if the area of the rectangle is 35 square centimeters, your formula will look like this: 35=lw{\displaystyle 35=lw}.


, Since you are working with a rectangle, it doesn’t matter whether you work with the l{\displaystyle l} or w{\displaystyle w} variable.

For example, if you found that w=l+2{\displaystyle w=l+2}, then you would substitute this relationship for w{\displaystyle w} in the area formula:35=lw{\displaystyle 35=lw}35=l(l+2){\displaystyle 35=l(l+2)}


, To do this, use the distributive property to multiply the terms in parentheses, then set the equation to 0.

For example:35=l(l+2){\displaystyle 35=l(l+2)}35=l2+2l{\displaystyle 35=l^{2}+2l}0=l2+2l−35{\displaystyle 0=l^{2}+2l-35}


, For complete instructions on how to do this, read Solve Quadratic Equations.

For example, the equation 0=l2+2l−35{\displaystyle 0=l^{2}+2l-35} can be factored as 0=(l+7)(l−5){\displaystyle 0=(l+7)(l-5)}.


, To do this, set each term to zero and solve for the variable. You will find two solutions, or roots, to the equation.

For example:0=(l+7){\displaystyle 0=(l+7)}−7=l{\displaystyle -7=l}AND0=(l−5){\displaystyle 0=(l-5)}5=l{\displaystyle 5=l}.In this case, you have one negative root. Since the length of a rectangle cannot be negative, you know that the length must be 5 cm.


, This will give you the length of the other side of the rectangle.

For example, if you know that the length of the rectangle is 5 cm, and that the relationship between the side lengths is w=l+2{\displaystyle w=l+2}, you would substitute 5 for the length in the formula:w=l+2{\displaystyle w=l+2}w=5+2{\displaystyle w=5+2}w=7{\displaystyle w=7}


, The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the side lengths of a right triangle, and c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of a right triangle’s hypotenuse.You use the Pythagorean Theorem because a diagonal of a rectangle cuts the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.The width and length of the rectangle are the side lengths of the triangle; the diagonal is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

Find the extreme points on a graph.,
Find the equation of the normal.",How to Find the Equation of a Tangent Line2," These are points where the graph reaches a local maximum (a point higher than the points on either side), or local minimum (lower than the points on either side). The tangent line always has a slope of 0 at these points (a horizontal line), but a zero slope alone does not guarantee an extreme point. Here's how to find them:Take the first derivative of the function to get f'(x), the equation for the tangent's slope.

Solve for f'(x) = 0 to find possible extreme points.

Take the second derivative to get f''(x), the equation that tells you how quickly the tangent's slope is changing.

For each possible extreme point, plug the x-coordinate a into f''(x). If f''(a) is positive, there is a local minimum at a. If f''(a) is negative, there is a local maximum. If f''(a) is 0, there is an inflection point, not an extreme point.

If there is a maximum or minimum at a, find f(a) to get the y-coordinate.


, The ""normal"" to a curve at a particular point passes through that point, but has a slope perpendicular to a tangent. To find the equation for the normal, take advantage of the fact that (slope of tangent)(slope of normal) = -1, when they both pass through the same point on the graph.In other words:

Find f'(x), the slope of the tangent line.

If the point is at x = a, find f'(a) to find the slope of the tangent at that point.

Calculate −1f′(a){\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{f'(a)}}} to find the slope of the normal.

Write the normal equation in slope-point form.

Assess your numbers.,
Factor the first number.,
Factor the second number.,
Write down the factors each number shares.,
Add any leftover factors to the multiplication sentence.,
Calculate the least common multiple.",How to Find the Least Common Multiple of Two Numbers2," This method works best when both of the numbers you are working with are greater than 10. If you have smaller numbers, you can use a different method to find the least common multiple more quickly.

For example, if you need to find the least common multiple of 20 and 84, you should use this method.


, You want to factor the number into its prime factors; that is, find the prime factors you can multiply together to get this number. One way to do this is by creating a  factor tree. Once you are done factoring, rewrite the prime factors as an equation.

For example, 2×10=20{\displaystyle {\mathbf {2} }\times 10=20} and 2×5=10{\displaystyle {\mathbf {2} }\times {\mathbf {5} }=10}, so the prime factors of 20 are 2, 2, and 5. Rewriting as an equation, you get 20=2×2×5{\displaystyle 20=2\times 2\times 5}.


, Do this in the same way you factored the first number, finding the prime factors you can multiply together to get the number.

For example, 2×42=84{\displaystyle {\mathbf {2} }\times 42=84}, 7×6=42{\displaystyle {\mathbf {7} }\times 6=42}, and 3×2=6{\displaystyle {\mathbf {3} }\times {\mathbf {2} }=6}, so the prime factors of 84 are 2, 7, 3, and 2. Rewriting as an equation, you get 84=2×7×3×2{\displaystyle 84=2\times 7\times 3\times 2}.


, Write the factors as a multiplication sentence. As you write each factor, cross it off in each numbers factorization equation.

For example, both numbers share a factor of 2, so write 2×{\displaystyle 2\times } and cross out a 2 in each number’s factorization equation.

Each number also shares a second 2, so change the multiplication sentence to 2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2} and cross out a second 2 in each factorization equation.


, These are the factors you did not cross out when comparing the two groups of factors. Thus, these are factors that the two numbers do not share.For example, in the equation 20=2×2×5{\displaystyle 20=2\times 2\times 5}, you crossed out both 2s, since these factors were shared with the other number. You have a factor of 5 left over, so add this to your multiplication sentence: 2×2×5{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 5}.

In the equation 84=2×7×3×2{\displaystyle 84=2\times 7\times 3\times 2}, you also crossed out both 2s. You have the factors 7 and 3 left over, so add these to your multiplication sentence: 2×2×5×7×3{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 5\times 7\times 3}.


, To do this, multiply together all of the factors in your multiplication sentence.

For example, 2×2×5×7×3=420{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 5\times 7\times 3=420}. So, the least common multiple of 20 and 84 is 420.

Extend your grid if necessary.,
Draw a circle around the numbers in the first column and last row of your grid.,
Complete the multiplication.",How to Find the Least Common Multiple of Two Numbers3," A tic-tac-toe grid is two sets of parallel lines that intersect each other perpendicularly. The lines form three rows and three columns and looks like the pound key (#) on a phone or keyboard. Write your first number in the top-center square of the grid. Write your second number in the top-right square of the grid.For example, if you are trying to find the least common multiple of 18 and 30, write 18 in the top center of your grid, and 30 in the top right of your grid.


, Write this number in the top-left square of your grid. It is helpful to use prime factors, but you don’t necessarily have to.

For example, since 18 and 30 are both even numbers, you know that that they both have a factor of 2. So write 2 in the top-left of the grid.


, Write the quotient in the square below either number. A quotient is the answer to a division problem.

For example, 18÷2=9{\displaystyle 18\div 2=9}, so write 9 under 18 in the grid.


30÷2=15{\displaystyle 30\div 2=15}, so write 15 under 30 in the grid.


, If there is no factor common to both quotients, you can skip this and the next step. If there is a common factor, write it in the middle-left square of the grid.

For example, 9 and 15 both have a factor of 3, so you would write 3 in the middle-left of the grid.


, Write this new quotient below the first ones.

For example, 9÷3=3{\displaystyle 9\div 3=3}, so write 3 under 9 in the grid.


15÷3=5{\displaystyle 15\div 3=5}, so write 5 under 15 in the grid.


, Follow this same process until you reach a point where the last set of quotients have no common factor.
, You can think of it as drawing an “L” for “least common multiple.” Write a multiplication sentence using all of these factors.For example, since 2 and 3 are in the first column of the grid, and 3 and 5 are in the last row of the grid, you would write the sentence 2×3×3×5{\displaystyle 2\times 3\times 3\times 5}.


, When you multiply all of these factors together, the result is the least common multiple of your two original numbers.For example, 2×3×3×5=90{\displaystyle 2\times 3\times 3\times 5=90}. So, the least common multiple of 18 and 30 is 90.

Understand the vocabulary of division.,

Use the original divisor as the new dividend.,
Repeat this process until you have a remainder of 0.,
Look at the last divisor you used.,
Multiply the two numbers.",How to Find the Least Common Multiple of Two Numbers4," The dividend is the number being divided. The divisor is the number the dividend is being divided by. The quotient is the answer to the division problem. The remainder is the amount left over after a number is divided by another.For example, in the equation 15÷6=2remainder3{\displaystyle 15\div 6=2\;{\text{remainder}}\;3}:15 is the dividend6 is the divisor2 is the quotient3 is the remainder.


, The formula is dividend=divisor×quotient+remainder{\displaystyle {\text{dividend}}={\text{divisor}}\times {\text{quotient}}+{\text{remainder}}}.You will use this form to set up Euclid’s algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

For example, 15=6×2+3{\displaystyle 15=6\times 2+3}.

The greatest common divisor is the largest divisor, or factor, that two numbers share.In this method, you first find the greatest common divisor, and then use it to find the least common multiple.


, Use the smaller of the two numbers as the divisor. Set up an equation in quotient-remainder form for these two numbers.

For example, if you are trying to find the least common multiple of 210 and 45, you would calculate 210=45×4+30{\displaystyle 210=45\times 4+30}.


, Use the remainder as the new divisor. Set up an equation in quotient-remainder form for these two numbers.

For example, 45=30×2+15{\displaystyle 45=30\times 2+15}.


, For each new equation, use the previous equation’s divisor as the new dividend, and the previous remainder as the new divisor.For example, 30=15×2+0{\displaystyle 30=15\times 2+0}. Since the remainder is 0, you need not divide any further.


, This is the greatest common divisor for the two numbers.For example, since the last equation was 30=15×2+0{\displaystyle 30=15\times 2+0}, the last divisor was 15, and so 15 is the greatest common divisor of 210 and 45.


, Divide the product by the greatest common divisor. This will give you the least common multiple of the two numbers.For example, 210×45=9450{\displaystyle 210\times 45=9450}. Dividing by the greatest common divisor, you get 945015=630{\displaystyle {\frac {9450}{15}}=630}. So, 630 is the least common multiple of 210 and 45.

Open a new Excel workbook and worksheet and draw a unit-cube using the Media Browser ""Shapes"" tool option -- that means the sides must be equal to 1 unit; that is side s = 1 unit.,
Label 3 consecutive corners (vertices) of the bottom face (the base) as A, B and C, thus forming triangle ABC.,
Use the Pythagorean theorem: a2 + b2 = c2, for the right triangle ABC where: `

Let 2 + 2 = 2

Then let = 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 = 2, for the ""left hand side"" (LHS) = 2 thus:

Examine the length of the RHS = AC squared: 2 = 2.,
Find the length of the long internal diagonal by using the Pythagorean theorem for right triangle ACD: 2 + 2 = 2, where AD is the long internal diagonal we seek.,
Find the internal diagonal of a cube with a different side length: modify the formula to side s equaling a different number, as not for the unit cube but any length of side s; so that each side of the triangle is a multiple of the parts of the unit cube:

Let 2 + 2 = 2 , by multiplication for sides of rt triangle ACD,
and 2 + 2 = 2, by substitution.,You're finished!",How to Find the Longest Internal Diagonal of a Cube,"

Review: The six square shaped exterior surfaces (faces) are equal in dimensions, size, area and have the same shape. Therefore all faces are congruent.;
,

See the figure: label as point D the corner (vertex) above C, at the top of the cube. The segment CD is at a right angle (90 degrees) to the base.

,
Let 2 = 2. Simplify that; you will find the length of the diagonal of the base, AC. We have AC = sqrt(2).



,

Use AC = sqrt(2) and knowing that CD = 1, we substitute these known values into the Pythagorean formula and have the following equation:
2 + 12 = 2

Then let 2 + 12 = 2 + 1 = 3, then 2 = 2.
Then realize that, the length of the internal diagonal from bottom to top and between opposing corners equals sqrt(3), because 2 = 3 (square root of the squared number) is just that number; let's call the number a, such as 2 = a ) and lengths are always positive numbers.

,
You also can modify the earlier formula to 2 + 2 = 2.
2 + 2 = 2, to convert from the unit cube with sides equaling 1, into a multiple of the sides of right triangle ABC with two legs = s*1, and its hypotenuse = s*sqrt(2).
In both cases, the absolute value of s (your cube's side length) is used as the multiplier.

Learn the definition of the domain.,
Learn how to find the domain of a variety of functions.,
Correctly state the domain.",How to Find the Domain of a Function1," The domain is defined as the set of input values for which the function produces an output value. In other words, the domain is the full set of x-values that can be plugged into a function to produce a y-value.;
, The type of function will determine the best method for finding a domain. Here are the basics that you need to know about each type of function, which will be explained in the next section:



A polynomial function without radicals or variables in the denominator. For this type of function, the domain is all real numbers.

A function with a fraction with a variable in the denominator. To find the domain of this type of function, set the bottom equal to zero and exclude the x value you find when you solve the equation.

A function with a variable inside a radical sign. To find the domain of this type of function, just set the terms inside the radical sign to >0 and solve to find the values that would work for x.

A function using the natural log (ln). Just set the terms in the parentheses to >0 and solve.

A graph. Check out the graph to see which values work for x.

A relation. This will be a list of x and y coordinates. Your domain will simply be a list of x coordinates.

, The proper notation for the domain is easy to learn, but it is important that you write it correctly to express the correct answer and get full points on assignments and tests. Here are a few things you need to know about writing the domain of a function:


The format for expressing the domain is an open bracket/parenthesis, followed by the 2 endpoints of the domain separated by a comma, followed by a closed bracket/parenthesis.

For example, [-1,5). This means that the domain goes from -1 to 5.



Use brackets such as to indicate that a number is included in the domain.

So in the example, [-1,5), the domain includes -1.



Use parentheses such as ( and ) to indicate that a number is not included in the domain.

So in the example, [-1,5), 5 is not included in the domain. The domain stops arbitrarily short of 5, i.e. 4.999…



Use “U” (meaning ""union"") to connect parts of the domain that are separated by a gap.'

For example, . This means that the domain goes from -1 to 10, inclusive, but that there is a gap in the domain at 5. This could be the result of, for example, a function with “x - 5” in the denominator.
You can use as many ""U"" symbols as necessary if the domain has multiple gaps in it.



Use infinity and negative infinity signs to express that the domain goes on infinitely in either direction.

Always use ( ), not , with infinity symbols.

Find the domain of a function with a square root when there are multiple solutions.",How to Find the Domain of a Function3," Let's say you're working with the following problem: Y =√(x-7)

, You cannot take the square root of a negative number, though you can take the square root of 0. So, set the terms inside the radicand to be greater than or equal to 0. Note that this applies not just to square roots, but to all even-numbered roots. It does not, however, apply to odd-numbered roots, because it is perfectly fine to have negatives under odd roots. Here's how:


x-7 ≧ 0

, Now, to isolate x on the left side of the equation, just add 7 to both sides, so you're left with the following:


x ≧ 7

, Here is how you would write it:


D = [7,∞)

, Let's say you're working with the following function: Y = 1/√( ̅x2 -4). When you factor the denominator and set it equal to zero, you'll get x ≠ (2, - 2). Here's where you go from there:


Now, check the area below -2 (by plugging in -3, for example), to see if the numbers below -2 can be plugged into the denominator to yield a number higher than 0. They do.

(-3)2 - 4 = 5


Now, check the area between -2 and 2. Pick 0, for example.

02 - 4 = -4, so you know the numbers between -2 and 2 don't work.


Now try a number above 2, such as +3.

32 - 4 = 5, so the numbers over 2 do work.


Write the domain when you're done. Here is how you would write the domain:

D = (-∞, -2) U (2, ∞)

, The natural log has to be a positive number, so set the terms inside the parentheses to greater than zero to make it so. Here's what you do:


x - 8 > 0

, Just isolate the variable x by adding 8 to both sides. Here's how:


x - 8 + 8 > 0 + 8
x > 8

Check out the x-values that are included in the graph.,
State the domain.",How to Find the Domain of a Function5,", This may be easier said than done, but here are some tips:


A line. If you see a line on the graph that extends to infinity, then all versions of x will be covered eventually, so the domain is equal to all real numbers.
A normal parabola. If you see a parabola that is facing upwards or downwards, then yes, the domain will be all real numbers, because all numbers on the x axis will eventually be covered.
A sideways parabola. Now, if you have a parabola with a vertex at (4,0) which extends infinitely to the right, then your domain is D = [4,∞)

, Just state the domain based on the type of graph you're working with. If you're uncertain and know the equation of the line, plug the x-coordinates back into the function to check.

, They are: 1, 2, 5.

, D = {1, 2, 5}

, For a relation to be a function, every time you put in one numerical x coordinate, you should get the same y coordinate. So, if you put in 3 for x, you should always get 6 for y, and so on. The following relation is not a function because you get two different values of ""y"" for each value of ""x"": {(1, 4),(3, 5),(1, 5)}."

Know the names of polygons.,
Draw the polygon.,
Draw the diagonals.,
Count the diagonals.,
Beware of counting a diagonal more than once.,
Practice with some examples.",How to Find How Many Diagonals Are in a Polygon1," You may need to first identify how many sides are present in the polygon. Each polygon has a prefix that indicates the number of sides it has. Here are the names of polygons with up to twenty sides:Quadrilateral/tetragon: 4 sides
Pentagon: 5 sides
Hexagon: 6 sides
Heptagon: 7 sides
Octagon: 8 sides
Nonagon/Enneagon: 9 sides
Decagon: 10 sides
Hendecagon: 11 sides
Dodecagon: 12 sides
Triskaidecagon/tridecagon: 13 sides
Tetrakaidecagon/tetradecagon: 14 sides
Pendedecagon: 15 sides
Hexdecagon: 16 sides
Heptdecagon: 17 sides
Octdecagon: 18 sides
Enneadecagon: 19 sides
Icosagon: 20 sides
Note that a triangle has no diagonals.;
, If you wanted to know how many diagonals were present in a square, you would start by drawing the square. The easiest way to find diagonals and count them is to draw the polygon symmetrically, each side has the same length. It’s important to note that even if the polygon is not symmetrical, it will still have the same number of diagonals.To draw the polygon, use a ruler and draw each side the same length, connecting all of the sides together.
If you’re unsure what the polygon will look like, search for pictures online. For example, a stop sign is an octagon.

, A diagonal is a line segment drawn from one corner of the shape to another, excluding the sides of the polygon.Starting at one vertex of the polygon, use a ruler to draw a diagonal to every other available vertex.


For a square, draw one line from the bottom left corner to the top right corner and another line from the bottom right corner to the top left corner.
Draw diagonals in different colors to make them easier to count.Note that this method gets much more difficult with polygons that have more than ten sides.

, There are two options for counting: you can count as you draw the diagonals or count them once they have been drawn. As you count each diagonal, draw a small number above the diagonal to denote that it has been counted. It is easy to lose track while counting when there are a lot of diagonals crossing each other.


For the square, there are two diagonals: one diagonal for every two vertices.A hexagon has 9 diagonals: there are three diagonals for every three vertices.
A heptagon has 14 diagonals. Past the heptagon, it gets more difficult to count the diagonals because there are so many of them.

, Each vertex may have multiple diagonals, but that doesn’t mean that the number of diagonals is equal to the number of vertices times the number of diagonals. Take care when counting the diagonals to count each one only once.For example, a pentagon (5 sides) has only 5 diagonals. Each vertex has two diagonals, so if you counted each diagonal from every vertex twice, you might think there were 10 diagonals. This is incorrect because you would have counted each diagonal twice!

, Draw some other polygons and count the number of diagonals. The polygon does not have to be symmetric for this method to work. In the case of a concave polygon, you may have to draw some of the diagonals outside the actual polygon.A hexagon has 9 diagonals.
A heptagon has 14 diagonals.

Set up the formula for arc length.,
Plug the length of the circle’s radius into the formula.,
Plug the value of the arc’s central angle into the formula.,
Multiply the radius by 2π{\displaystyle 2\pi }.,
Divide the arc’s central angle by 360.,
Multiply the two numbers together.",How to Find Arc Length1," The formula is arc length=2π(r)(θ360){\displaystyle {\text{arc length}}=2\pi (r)({\frac {\theta }{360}})}, where r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle and θ{\displaystyle \theta } equals the measurement of the arc’s central angle, in degrees., This information should be given, or you should be able to measure it. Make sure you substitute this value for the variable r{\displaystyle r}.

For example, if the circle’s radius is 10 cm, your formula will look like this: arc length=2π(10)(θ360){\displaystyle {\text{arc length}}=2\pi (10)({\frac {\theta }{360}})}.


, This information should be given, or you should be able to measure it. Make sure you are working with degrees, and not radians, when using this formula. Substitute the central angle’s measurement for θ{\displaystyle \theta } in the formula.

For example, if the arc’s central angle is 135 degrees, your formula will look like this: arc length=2π(10)(135360){\displaystyle {\text{arc length}}=2\pi (10)({\frac {135}{360}})}.


, If you are not using a calculator, you can use the approximation π=3.14{\displaystyle \pi =3.14} for your calculations. Rewrite the formula using this new value, which represents the circle’s circumference.For example:2π(10)(135360){\displaystyle 2\pi (10)({\frac {135}{360}})}2(3.14)(10)(135360){\displaystyle 2(3.14)(10)({\frac {135}{360}})}(62.8)(135360){\displaystyle (62.8)({\frac {135}{360}})}


, Since a circle has 360 degrees total, completing this calculation gives you what portion of the entire circle the sector represents. Using this information, you can find what portion of the circumference the arc length represents.

For example:(62.8)(135360){\displaystyle (62.8)({\frac {135}{360}})}(62.8)(.375){\displaystyle (62.8)(.375)}


, This will give you the length of the arc.

For example:(62.8)(.375){\displaystyle (62.8)(.375)}23.55{\displaystyle 23.55}So, the length of an arc of a circle with a radius of 10 cm, having a central angle of 135 degrees, is about 23.55 cm.

Define the formula.,
Identify the number of sides in the polygon.,
Plug the number of sides into the equation.,
Solve the equation.,
Practice with more examples.",How to Find How Many Diagonals Are in a Polygon2," The formula to find the number of sides of a polygon is n(n-3)/2 where “n” equals the number of sides of the polygon.Using the distributive property this can be rewritten as (n2 - 3n)/2. You may see it either way, both equations are identical.


This equation can be used to find the number of diagonals of any polygon.
Note that the triangle is an exception to this rule. Due to the shape of the triangle, it does not have any diagonals., To use this formula, you must identify the number of sides that the polygon has. The number of sides is given in the name of the polygon, you just need to know what each name means. Here are some of common prefixes you will see in polygons:Tetra (4), penta (5), hexa (6), hepta (7), octa (8), ennea (9), deca (10), hendeca (11), dodeca (12), trideca (13), tetradeca (14), pentadeca (15), etc.
For very large sided polygons you may simply see it written “n-gon”, where “n” is the number of sides. For example, a 44-sided polygon would be written as 44-gon.
If you are given a picture of the polygon, you can simply count the number of sides.

, Once you know how many sides the polygon has, you just need to plug that number into the equation and solve. Everywhere you see “n” in the equation will be replaced with the number of sides of the polygon.For example: A dodecagon has 12 sides.
Write the equation: n(n-3)/2
Plug in the variable: (12(12 - 3))/2

, Finish by solving the equation using the proper order of operations. Start by solving the subtraction, then multiply, then divide. The final answer is the number of diagonals the polygon has.For example: (12(12 – 3))/2
Subtract: (12*9)/2
Multiply: (108)/2
Divide: 54
A dodecagon has 54 diagonals.

, The more practice you have with a math concept, the better you will be at using it. Doing lots of examples will also help you memorize the formula in case you need it for a quiz, test, or exam. Remember, this formula works for a polygon of any number of sides greater than 3.


Hexagon (6 sides): n(n-3)/2 = 6(6-3)/2 = 6*3/2 = 18/2 = 9 diagonals.
Decagon (10 sides): n(n-3)/2 = 10(10-3)/2 = 10*7/2 = 70/2 = 35 diagonals.
Icosagon (20 sides): n(n-3)/2 = 20(20-3)/2 = 20*17/2 = 340/2 = 170 diagonals.
96-gon (96 sides): 96(96-3)/2 = 96*93/2 = 8928/2 = 4464 diagonals.

Multiply the radius by the radian measurement.",How to Find Arc Length2," The formula is arc length=θ(r){\displaystyle {\text{arc length}}=\theta (r)}, where θ{\displaystyle \theta } equals the measurement of the arc’s central angle in radians, and r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the circle’s radius., You need to know the length of the radius to use this method. Make sure you substitute the length of the radius for the variable r{\displaystyle r}.

For example, if the circle’s radius is 10 cm, your formula will look like this: arc length=θ(10){\displaystyle {\text{arc length}}=\theta (10)}.


, You should have this information in radians. If you know the angle measurement in degrees, you cannot use this method.

For example, if the arc’s central angle is 2.36 radians, your formula will look like this: arc length=2.36(10){\displaystyle {\text{arc length}}=2.36(10)}.


, The product will be the length of the arc.

For example:2.36(10){\displaystyle 2.36(10)}=23.6{\displaystyle =23.6}So, the length of an arc of a circle with a radius of 10 cm, having a central angle of 23.6 radians, is about 23.6 cm.

Take 72, for example, but the number could be denoted by a variable.

, There are many methods of doing this, but usually, the simplest way is to make a factor tree. This works because according to number theory, every integer (except -1, 0, and 1) has a number of prime numbers that, when multiplied together, will equal the number. Remember that 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.


72 should be factorized into 2 and 36, 2, 6, and 6, and finally, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, which equals 23*32.

,


In the example 23 and 32, the exponents are 3 and 2 - adding one to each will make them 4 and 3.

,


4 x 3 = 12. There are 12 factors for the number 72 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.


, Now, because x1 = x, 29, 13, and 5 all have exponents to the first power.
Add exponents by one. 3, 2, 2, 2.
Multiply the modified exponents together. There are 24 factors of the number 7540.;

, In this case, you're working with 3 numbers.

, Now take the sum of the numbers, 9, and divide it by the amount of numbers, 3. 9/3 = 3. The mean, or the average of all the numbers in the set, is 3. Remember that you won't always get a nice even number for your answer.

, Let's say you're working with the following numbers: 4, 2, 8, 1, 15. Just reorder them in ascending order, like so: 1, 2, 4, 8, 15.

, How you do this will depend on whether you have an even amount of numbers or an odd amount. Here's what you can do in either situation:


If odd, cross out the leftmost number, then the rightmost number, and then repeat. When you have one number left, this is your median. If you're working with the numbers 4, 7, 8, 11, and 21, then 8 is your mode because it's the number in the middle.
If even, cross out numbers on either side, but you should have two numbers exactly in the middle. Add them together and divide by two for the median value. (If the two numbers in the middle are the same, that number is your median.) If you're working with the numbers 1, 2, 5, 3, 7, and 10, then your two middle numbers are 5 and 3. Add up 5 and 3 to get 8 and divide this result by 2 to get 4 as your median.

, In this case, you're working with the numbers 2, 4, 5, 5, 4, and 5. It can help to order them from least to greatest here too.

, Think: ""Mode is most."" In this example, the number 5 occurs the most, so that is the mode. If there are two numbers that occur the most, then that set is ""bimodal,"" and if more than two numbers occur the most, then the set is ""multi-modal.""

Compare the value of pizzas.",How to Figure Cost Per Square Inch of Pizza1," The formula is A=π(r2){\displaystyle A=\pi (r^{2})} where r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the circle’s radius., Pizza sizes are measured by their diameter. To find the length of the radius, you have to divide the diameter in half.

For example, if you are ordering a 20 inch pizza, calculate 20÷2=10{\displaystyle 20\div 2=10}. So the radius of the pizza is 10 inches.


, Remember to substitute for the variable r{\displaystyle r}.

For example, if the radius is 10 inches, your formula will look like this: A=π(102){\displaystyle A=\pi (10^{2})}.


, To square a number, multiply it by itself.

For example, if the radius is 10 inches, you would calculate 10×10=100{\displaystyle 10\times 10=100}, so your formula will now look like this: A=π(100){\displaystyle A=\pi (100)}.


, You can use a calculator, or use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }. The result will give you the area, in square inches, of your pizza.

For example:A=π(100){\displaystyle A=\pi (100)}A=3.14(100){\displaystyle A=3.14(100)}A=314{\displaystyle A=314}So, the area of a 20-inch round pizza is 314 square inches.


, This will give you the cost per square inch of the pizza.

For example, if a pizza costs $32 and has an area of 314 square inches, you would calculate 32÷314=.101{\displaystyle 32\div 314=.101}. So, the cost per square inch of pizza is about .10, or 10 cents.


, When comparing value, the best value is the pizza with the lowest cost per square inch. This is only true, however, when comparing pizzas with the same toppings. A cheese pizza is likely to be cheaper per square inch than a pizza with several toppings, but that doesn’t necessarily make it the best value.

You will have to contact the restaurant and ask if they will provide you with the length and width of the pizza. If it is a square pizza, the length and width will be the same.

For example, you might want to find the value of a square 16-inch pizza. Both the length and the width will be 16 inches.


, Due to the commutative property of multiplication, It doesn’t matter which dimension you use for the length and which you use for the width.

For example, for a square 16-inch pizza, your formula will look like this: A=16×16{\displaystyle A=16\times 16}.


, This will give you the area of the pizza in square inches.

For example:A=16×16{\displaystyle A=16\times 16}A=256{\displaystyle A=256}So, the area of a square 16-inch pizza is 256 square inches.


, This will give you the cost per square inch of the pizza.

For example, if a pizza costs $32 and has an area of 256 square inches, you would calculate 32÷256=.125{\displaystyle 32\div 256=.125}. So, the cost per square inch of pizza is about .13, or 13 cents.


, The pizza with the lowest cost per square inch will have the best value. However, you should only compare similar types of pizzas when looking for the best value (for example, two veggie pizzas). A pizza with fewer toppings will cost less per square inch than a pizza with several toppings, but that doesn’t necessarily make it the best value.

Know the formula for calculating average speed.,
Determine the starting position.,
Measure the distance to the endpoint.,
Measure the elapsed time.,
Calculate the average speed.,
Convert the units as necessary.",How to Find an Average Rate of Change1," Suppose you want to know the average speed of travel, but you do not have a speedometer. It is possible to calculate speed with some basic measurements and calculations. The average speed of any object is found by dividing the change in position by the change in time. This can be written mathematically as:speed=ΔxΔt{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta t}}}

In this function, Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x} represents the change in position or the distance traveled. The denominator Δt{\displaystyle \Delta t} represents the change in time.
;
, Average speed of an object is is the calculation of its change in position, or location, over a chosen period of time. Therefore, to begin, you need to select the starting position for your measurement.For example, if you want to measure your average walking speed from your house to your school across town, the starting position is your house. 

The “starting” position does not have to be a true start. For example, you could choose to measure the average speed of a race car in the Indy 500. You might select any point along the track as the “starting” point for your measurement.


, You can calculate the average speed over any distance or length of time that you choose. The only limiting factor is the quality or precision of your measuring instrument. For example, measuring the speed of a sprinter requires accuracy within a few centimeters, while measuring the speed of a race car needs to be accurate to within a few feet or meters.To measure your walking speed from home to school, you could find the distance either by looking at a local map, or by traveling the route with a car’s odometer. For this example, assume that the distance is 0.6 miles.

For the Indy 500 race car, one lap of the Indianapolis Speedway race track is 2.5 miles. Therefore, check the car’s position at any point on the track. When the car passes that same point again, it’s distance will be 2.5 miles.


, The average speed requires you to measure the amount of time that goes by. As with the distance measurements, this may require more of less precision, depending on the speed itself. For example, you need a stopwatch that measures tenths or hundredths of seconds to measure the speed of world-class sprinters, but a regular watch with a second hand can measure the speed of a race car around a track.For the walking trip to school, you can probably use a wristwatch to measure the time. Suppose, for this example, that the walk to school takes fifteen minutes.

Watching the race car around the Indianapolis Speedway, you can time each lap with a watch or stopwatch. A fast car will take about 45 seconds to complete one lap.


, After you have taken the measurements that you need, you then simply place them into the formula for speed calculation to find the speed of the object. Pay attention to the units that you use for the calculation.For the walking trip to school, the distance was measured at 0.6 miles, and the time was fifteen minutes. Place this information in the formula as follows:


speed=ΔxΔt=0.615=0.4{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta t}}={\frac {0.6}{15}}=0.4} miles/minute.



The Indy race car traveled 2.5 miles in 45 seconds. This data goes into the formula for speed calculation as follows:


speed=ΔxΔt=2.545=0.0556{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta t}}={\frac {2.5}{45}}=0.0556} miles/second.




, Sometimes, the final calculation may not be in the units that are most useful to you. If you need or wish to report the speed in different units, you will need to multiply by some conversion factor.

For example, a race car’s speed is generally measured in miles per hour, not miles per second. Because one hour is equal to 3600 seconds, you can convert the calculated speed by multiplying by 3600 seconds per hour.0.0556 miles per second∗3600 seconds per hour=200.16 miles per hour{\displaystyle 0.0556{\text{ miles per second}}*3600{\text{ seconds per hour}}=200.16{\text{ miles per hour}}}.

Decide how long you wish to measure the growth rate.,
Calculate the starting size.,
Measure the ending height or weight.,
Use the growth rate formula for either height or weight.",How to Find an Average Rate of Change2," For things that grow, whether in height or weight, you can measure the rate of growth by finding the change in whatever quality you wish to measure, divided by the time. This formula can be expressed mathematically as:rate=ΔhΔt{\displaystyle {\text{rate}}={\frac {\Delta h}{\Delta t}}} or ΔwΔt{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta w}{\Delta t}}}

In these two examples, h{\displaystyle h} represents the height and w{\displaystyle w} represents weight. In both of these, t{\displaystyle t} is for the elapsed time.


, Some plants, like the Asian bamboo, grow very fast, with visible differences taking place within hours. For measuring something like the growth rate of a child, changes may not take place for months or a year or more. You need to select a time period that is relevant for what you are measuring.Suppose an elementary class plants bean seeds and begins measuring their growth as soon as the first sprout appears. A reasonable time measurement might be about a month, measured in days.

Scientists raising an orphaned baby elephant wanted to measure its growth rate over the first 90 days of its life.


, Measuring a growth rate requires that you set some starting point and measure the size at that time.For the example of the students’ bean plants, they chose the starting point to be the day that the first sprout appeared. The height at the point is set at 0 cm.

For the baby elephant, veterinarians measured the elephant’s weight the day it was born. Its initial weight on that day was 200 pounds., After the time elapses for your study, measure the height or weight of the object whose growth you are studying.For the bean plants, the average height of the students’ plants on the 30th day was 24 inches tall. Because the plants began at a height of 0, the amount of growth was 24 inches.

For the elephant, after the 90 day study period, the veterinarians measured its weight to be 400 pounds.


, Enter the data that you measured into the formula and perform the calculations to find the growth rate.

For the students’ bean example, the calculation will look like this:


rate=24 inches30 days=0.8 inches day{\displaystyle {\text{rate}}={\frac {24{\text{ inches}}}{30{\text{ days}}}}=0.8{\frac {\text{ inches}}{\text{ day}}}}



For the elephant’s growth rate, you must calculate the amount of change in the weight in the numerator as part of the calculation:


rate=400−200 pounds90 days{\displaystyle {\text{rate}}={\frac {400-200{\text{ pounds}}}{90{\text{ days}}}}}


rate=200 pounds90 days{\displaystyle {\text{rate}}={\frac {200{\text{ pounds}}}{90{\text{ days}}}}}


rate=2.22poundsday{\displaystyle {\text{rate}}=2.22{\frac {\text{pounds}}{\text{day}}}}

, Finding the average rate of change of a function means measuring the value of the function at two different points along the x-axis. Select one value of x where you wish to begin measuring, and then determine how far along the axis you wish to advance.

Depending on your purposes, you may choose a wider or narrower range of x values to measure. For this exercise, select the first x-value at 0 and the second x-value at 3.


, Rate of change of the function measures how much the y-values change over the chosen horizontal x-distance. To calculate this change, you need to know the y values at each chosen value of x.For the sample function, y(x)=x2{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{2}}, select the two values x=0 and x=3, for example. The corresponding values of y(x){\displaystyle y(x)}, therefore, are:


y(0)=02=0{\displaystyle y(0)=0^{2}=0}


y(3)=32=9{\displaystyle y(3)=3^{2}=9}




, The rate of change of a function can be written formally as:A(x)=ΔyΔx=f(x+h)−f(x)h{\displaystyle A(x)={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}={\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}}

In this formula, f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} represents the value of the function at the first chosen x-value. f(x+h){\displaystyle f(x+h)} is the value of the function some distance away at a second value of x. The denominator h{\displaystyle h} is the distance between the two measurements.


h{\displaystyle h} can also be represented as Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x}, since it is the distance or change in the chosen x-values.

For the chosen function y(x)=x2{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{2}}, you can calculate the average rate of change from 0 to 3 as follows:


A(x)=ΔyΔx=9−03−0=3{\displaystyle A(x)={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}={\frac {9-0}{3-0}}=3}.




, For this function, the rate of change is a measure of how much the value of the function changes vertically as you move horizontally along the x-axis. In this case, the parabola y(x)=x2{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{2}} begins at point (0,0) and climbs to point (3,9) over the measured interval. Although the function itself is not a straight line, the average rate of change is measured as the slope of the straight line connecting those two points. This line climbs 3 units for each single unit increase in x.Note that the average rate of change for a function may differ depending on the location that you choose to measure. For the parabola example, the average rate of change is 3 from x=0 to x=3. However, for the same function measured from x=3 to x=6, also a distance of 3 units, the average rate of change becomes 8.33.

, P stands for “Parentheses”; E stands for “Exponents”; M stands for “Multiplication”; D stands for “Division”; A stands for “Addition”; and S stands for “Subtraction.”, The order of operations is the standard sequence in which you must perform operations in an expression that has more than one. PEMDAS tells you the order in which you must complete the operations.

If you calculate an expression without using the order of operations, your answer will be incorrect.


, Not all problems will have them, so If you don’t see parentheses, you can skip this step.
, If there are no exponents, skip this step.
, These operations are of equal importance and must be performed from left to right.If there is no multiplication or division, skip this step.
, These operations are of equal importance and must be performed from left to right.If there is no addition or subtraction, skip this step.
, Any operations contained within parentheses must be completed first.

For example, if you are solving (7−2)×42÷2−3+1{\displaystyle (7-2)\times 4^{2}\div 2-3+1}, your first step is to calculate 7−2=5{\displaystyle 7-2=5}.(7−2)×42÷2−3+1{\displaystyle (7-2)\times 4^{2}\div 2-3+1}=(5)×42÷2−3+1{\displaystyle =(5)\times 4^{2}\div 2-3+1}


, Calculate the value of all exponents in the expression.

For example, the next step in 5×42÷2−3+1{\displaystyle 5\times 4^{2}\div 2-3+1} is to calculate 42=16{\displaystyle 4^{2}=16}.5×42÷2−3+1{\displaystyle 5\times 4^{2}\div 2-3+1}=5×16÷2−3+1{\displaystyle =5\times 16\div 2-3+1}


, Remember, these two operations are equally important and should be completed left to right.

For example, the next step in 5×16÷2−3+1{\displaystyle 5\times 16\div 2-3+1} is to calculate 5×16=80{\displaystyle 5\times 16=80}. Then you would complete the division. Thus: 5×16÷2−3+1{\displaystyle 5\times 16\div 2-3+1}=80÷2−3+1{\displaystyle =80\div 2-3+1}=40−3+1{\displaystyle =40-3+1}


, These two operations are also equally important and should be completed left to right.

For example, the next step in 40−3+1{\displaystyle 40-3+1} is to calculate 40−3=37{\displaystyle 40-3=37}. Then you would complete the addition. Thus:40−3+1{\displaystyle 40-3+1}=37+1{\displaystyle =37+1}=38{\displaystyle =38}

If 5 students are in both classes, how many are in neither class?"" Venn Diagrams, however, are versatile and can be used to reflect data for a variety of purposes, such as:


Outlining a comparison and contrast paper for English class.
Weighing out pros and cons of a complex decision.
Classifying data into various subsets.;
, Referring to the example above, a Venn Diagram can be as simple as a pair of overlapping circles. Yet, Venn Diagrams can also be complex a collection of variously-sized, overlapping circles used to create classifications. Depending on the complexity of your problem and the comparisons being performed, it may be a good idea to draft a few versions of your diagram with a pen or pencil before committing yourself to a design.

, Once you've determined the purpose and complexity of your diagram, decide on the correct tool. For the example from the first step, since there are only two circles, and the data required is minimal, the best tool is probably a pencil or pen.


If presentation matters, a compass can be employed to ensure that the circles are precise or, if the template will be reused, design software might be the best option.

, This really depends on the problem being solved. If your problem is similar to the word problem from the prior section, since there is only one number that goes in each part, a relatively small diagram (with circles roughly the size of the circumference of a tennis ball) would be more than enough space.


When using a Venn Diagram non-mathematically, it is best to err on the side of too much room rather than too little. So if you are using your diagram to brainstorm for an English essay, you might want to build a diagram that takes up most of a sheet of notebook paper.

, If slight irregularity of the circle(s) is not an issue, simply hold your writing tool in your hand at a 45-degree angle, and depending on the desired size, make a circular motion with your wrist or elbow while the tip of the pen or pencil is on the paper surface. Repeat as needed.

, First find a ""guide."" A roll of masking tape, a cookie tin, a coffee can, or some other flat-bottomed, circular container is ideal. Place it on your sheet of paper, being sure to leave room for additional circles as needed. Take your drawing implement and place the tip on the paper at the edge of the guide, then move the tip along the perimeter of the object's bottom. Move the guide and repeat as needed.

, Hold your drawing tool at a 45-degree angle and put your hand on the paper, firmly enough that you can pivot on the bone at the heel of your hand, but lightly enough that the paper can be rotated. Put the tip of your writing tool on the paper so that it will draw, but not stop the paper from moving. While keeping your hand still, slowly rotate paper. You MUST keep the point of the pencil in the same place. Continue turning the sheet until the circle is complete.

, If you find yourself frequently drawing Venn Diagrams, this may be the best method to choose. There are different types of compasses available-- some made for drafting blueprints, others for completing math home work. In either case, they work by creating a pivot point affixed to the paper, with an adjustable arm that guides a pencil tip across the paper in a circular shape.

, Nearly every standard operating system installation comes with a ""Paint"" program with basic drawing tools. For a standard Venn Diagram, this is usually sufficient; however, any graphic design software can be employed, provided it has a tool specifically for drawing circles. To access ""Paint"" from a Windows operating system:


Mouse over to the Windows icon in the lower left-side of your computer screen.
Click on the icon and select ""All Programs"" from the bottom of the pop-up menu.
Click on the ""Accessories"" folder to display its contents.
Double-click on ""Paint"" and wait for it to open.

, While you could still freehand a circle using paint, design software offers the unique advantage of being able to create symmetrical designs by use of special commands. To use the circle tool:


Open paint, and locate the circle drawing tool within the ""Shapes"" command tab at the top of the screen.
Click on the circle tool and small, cross shaped cursor will appear on the white canvas under the command tabs.
Press and hold the left-mouse button, then drag the cursor a few inches down, creating what looks like a black line. While still holding the left-mouse button, now drag the cursor roughly the same distance to the right. You've just created a circle. Practice a few times to get the hang of it.

, To draw a circle, click on the ""File"" command at the top left-hand corner of the screen, then click on ""New."" With the new file open, follow the instructions from step 2. Before doing this, you may wish to change the color and thickness of the lines by using the settings provided in the command tabs.

, For simpler Venn Diagrams, once you've drawn a circle in the size you need for your diagram, rather than attempt to draw a second circle of equal size, it's easier and more precise to use the Select, Copy, Cut, and Paste tools.


Click on the circle tool in the shapes command tab, then click on the ""Fill"" command located on the right of the tab, ensuring that it is set to ""No Fill.""
Draw a circle in the size you need. You can use the box that appears around the circle to adjust the circumference and height as needed.
Locate the ""Select"" command tab at the top of the screen. Click on the down arrow below the word ""Select."" A drop-down menu will appear.
Select ""Transparent Selection"" from the drop-down menu commands. This ensures that when you copy, cut and paste your circles onto one another, only the outline will overlap.
Click on the ""Select"" tool, then press and hold the left mouse button just a few millimeters to the left and above the top left-side of your circle. While still holding the left mouse, drag the cursor down to just below the bottom of the circle and then an equal distance to the right, enclosing the circle in a box made of dotted lines.
Press ""Ctrl+C"" while the circle is in the box to copy it; next, press ""Ctrl+V"" to paste a duplicate copy of your circle into the top left hand side of your canvas.
Mouse over to the duplicate copy and, using the cursor, hold down the left-mouse button and drag the duplicate over to the original. Adjust the overlap as needed.

, While you can always print your diagram and fill it in by hand, design programs have a text function that will add Text boxes to your diagram as needed.

, Once you've created a basic Venn Diagram, you can save the file to your desktop and reuse it as much as you like.

, This requires knowing what you intend to compare. Using the mathematical word problem from section one, in order to solve the problem, we would label one circle ""Algebra"" and the other would be labeled ""Creative Writing."" Other more complex deigns will require multiple labels, one for each circle.

, For the same word problem, we are told that 5 students are in both classes, so the number ""5"" would be listed in the overlapping area between the circles, while the number ""13"" would go in the Creative Writing circle and ""20"" in the Algebra circle.


A non-mathematical use for a Venn Diagram might be creating a visual comparison to catalog the similarities and differences between two breeds of dog, or comparing hamburgers from two different restaurants. In these cases, the circles would be named for the two dogs or restaurants, respectively, with a list of common attributes in the overlapping area, and a list of differences in the circles themselves.

, The word problem mentioned above asks the reader to solve for a specific value, but not all Venn Diagrams require the reader to provide an exact answer. Often, the purpose of the diagram might be to organize thoughts on a complex topic, or help with decision making. Depending on what type of comparison is being made, the results and how to interpret them will vary.

Review the general meaning of fractions.,
Recognize the special relationship of percentages.,
Use a calculator to convert any fraction to a decimal or percentage.,
Convert decimals to percentages by shifting the decimal point.,
Memorize basic fraction conversions.",How to Do Percentages on a Calculator1," A fraction is a comparison between two numbers, usually representing the size of a part of something to the size of the whole thing. The classic example is a pie that is cut into eight, for example, equal portions. The top of the fraction, called the numerator, represents the number of pieces you select. The bottom of the fraction, called the denominator, represents the total number of pieces in the pie - in this case, 8.


For example, the fraction 1/8 represents one piece of the pie that has been cut in eight pieces.
The fraction 7/8 represents 7 pieces, almost the full pie.;
, A percentage is a special kind of fraction in which the denominator is always set at 100. While this is not practical when cutting slices of an actual pie, the concept of percentages is much more useful because it is standard.


For example, with fractions, the size of “half” of something will depend on the number of pieces. If your “pie” is cut into eight pieces, then half would be four. But if your “pie” is in 22 pieces, then half would be eleven. The target always changes. But with percentages, one-half is always the same - 50%.

, If you are presented with any fraction, you can very easily convert it to a decimal number using any calculator. Just recognize that a fraction represents a division problem, and use your calculator to divide the numerator by the denominator. Your calculator will give you the decimal equivalent of the fraction.


For example, suppose you have the fraction 1/2. On your calculator, perform the operation 1 ÷ 2, and the calculator will show the result 0.5.
As another example, convert the fraction 1/4 into a decimal by performing the operation 1 ÷ 4. The result is 0.25.
For a more complicated example, you can convert the fraction 274/312 into a decimal with the operation 274 ÷ 312. The result will be 0.878. (There are more digits, but for our purposes we can stop at three.)

, If you have a number that is already represented by a decimal, converting that to a percentage is easy. Because the decimal numbering system is based on factors of 10, you can transform a decimal number into a percentage by simply shifting the decimal point by two spaces to the right and then adding a % sign. If your decimal number consists of only one digit, you can add 0’s on the right of the number, such as turning 0.5 into 0.50 or even 0.500. These all have the same numerical value.


For example, consider the example above of 1/2, which we converted to the decimal of 0.5. To change this decimal to a percentage, shift the decimal point two spaces to the right. First rewrite 0.5 as 0.50. Then when you shift the decimal point two spaces, you turn 0.50 into the number 50%.
The example of 1/4, which has a decimal equivalent of 0.25, can be turned into the percentage 25%.

, It is useful if you can memorize the percentage representations of certain basic fractions. Because the denominator for a percentage is always 100, certain values are constant. For example, you should know the following conversions:


3/4 = 75%
1/2 = 50%
1/3 = 33 1/3%
1/4 = 25%
1/5 = 20%
1/8 = 12.5% (this is often used in banking)

"
"
Add percentages very directly.,
Subtract percentages in the same manner.,
Multiply or divide using decimal equivalents.",How to Do Percentages on a Calculator2," Because percentages all represent fractions with the common denominator of 100, you can add a list of percentages without any additional work. By contrast, remember that to add fractions, you must work through the steps of finding common denominators and converting your fractions to those common denominators. With percentages, however, no additional work is necessary. Just add the numbers together.


For example, if each of six people draws a portion of the company’s payroll, you can find out how much they represent together by just adding the relative percentages. If their respective shares are 10%, 5%, 8%, 22%, 10% and 8%, you can just add 10+5+8+22+10+8 = 63. Those six people make up 63% of the company’s payroll.
When you are adding, ignore the percent symbol, and just add the numbers. Put the symbol back in your final answer.

, Again, because percentages represent fractions with the common denominator of 100, you do not need to do any additional work to subtract percentages. If you are working the the concept of removing some percentage from an original whole item, you should represent the whole item with the number 100 (because the whole means 100%).


For example, suppose you want to calculate an income percentage. 100% represents the entire income from some project, but then you must subtract, for example, 10% for expenses, 12% for salaries, and 25% for taxes. How much is left? Simply use your calculator to perform the subtraction of 100-10-12-25. The result is 53%.

, If you have a problem that is initially written as 25% x 30, just write the 25% as its decimal equivalent 0.25 and conduct the operation. This would be 0.25 x 30 which gives the result of 7.5. Similarly, if you have a division problem of 200 ÷ 10%, rewrite this as 200 ÷ 0.10 and enter this into your calculator. You will get the result of 2000.


The last result may appear surprising, if you expect division to produce a smaller result than the starting number. However, you should understand that division by a number less than one will always lead to an increase by the reciprocal of that number. For example, dividing by 1/10 is the same as multiplying by 10. Dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2.

"
"
Perform multiplication to find the percent “of” a number.,
Convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.,
Write your result without a percentage symbol.",How to Do Percentages on a Calculator3," A common calculation involving percentages is to find some percent “of” another number. For example, if you are in a restaurant you may want to tip 15% “of” your total bill. When working with percentages, the word “of” carries the same meaning as “times” or “multiply.” Therefore, 15% “of” 100, for example, means the same as 15% x 100.

, To calculate the percentage of the whole number, you need to first turn the percentage into a decimal as already described. Then simply multiply.


For example, completing the problem of finding 15% of 100, rewrite the 15% as 0.15. Then just multiply 0.15 x 100, to get the solution of 15.

, When you set out to find a percentage of a whole number, your result will be a number and not a percentage. You may begin with a percentage symbol, but when you convert that percentage to a decimal to conduct the multiplication, your answer will no longer have a percentage symbol.


In the example of 15% of 100, the result is the whole number 15.

Use the % key for calculations.",How to Do Percentages on a Calculator4," Most simple calculators will contain a key with the % symbol. More advanced, graphing calculators may not have this key because the makers expect that you can operate without it. But many more basic calculators will have it.

, The simplest use of the % key is to convert any number from its percentage form to its decimal form. Just enter the number and press the % button, and the calculator will show the decimal equivalent.


For example, to represent the number 4% on your calculator, just press the button 4 and then %. Your calculator will turn the number 4 into 0.04, which is the decimal equivalent.
To change the number 82.5% into a decimal, just type the buttons 8, 2, . , 5, %. The calculator will now show the value of 0.825.

, The % key on your calculator makes certain calculations very simple. Suppose you want to calculate a tip amount, and you want to find 15% of the total bill of $75.32. If you have your calculator available, you will enter the buttons 15% x 75.32. You should get the result of 11.298, which represents a tip of $11.30.


Whenever you are using a calculator for percentage calculations, you should make sure to press the Clear (C) or All Clear (AC) button before starting.
As you enter the numbers for this calculation, you should notice that as soon as your hit the % button, your number of 15 converts to .15. The calculator will the proceed to calculate .15 x 75.32.

In this example, ""seven thousand four hundred thirty eight"" is provided in written form (a.k.a. its ""word name""). Change it so that it will be in numerical form.

;
, Take another look at the number in your problem. Separate out each different place value and write the place values separately in numerical form, separated by plus signs.


Note that the form you will produce in this step is actually known as a value's ""expanded form.""
As you get comfortable with the process, you might be able to skip this step and move directly onto the next one.

Example: In this problem, the separate place values are: ""seven thousand,"" ""four hundred,"" ""thirty,"" and ""eight.""

""Seven thousand"" = 7000
""Four hundred"" = 400
""Thirty"" = 30
""Eight"" = 8
In expanded form, the value is: 7000 + 400 + 30 + 8



, To find the standard form of your number, you simply need to add together all of the different place value pieces.



Example: 7000 + 400 + 30 + 8 = 7438

, Locate the decimal point. Shift it from its current position to a point just to the right of the first integer.


Do not forget where the decimal point originally was while doing this.

Example A: 429000000000 => 4.29

Note that there was no visible decimal point in this problem, but the decimal point was implied at the very end of the whole number.



Example B: 0.0000000078 => 7.8

, Count the number of places you moved the decimal point. This number will become the index.


When you shift the decimal place to the left, the index will be a positive number. When you shift the decimal place to the right, the index will be a negative number.

Example A: The decimal point was moved 11 places to the left, so the index is 11.

Example B: The decimal point was moved nine places to the right, so the index is -9.

, To rewrite the number in standard form, you must write the new numerical value multiplied by 10 raised to the value of your index.



Example A: The standard form of 429000000000 is: 4.29 * 1011


Example B: The standard form of 0.0000000078 is: 7.8 * 10-9

Look at the original equation.,
Move all terms to one side of the equation.,
Write your final answer.",How to Do Standard Form3," If you have an equation with one variable, you will need to rewrite that equation so that the value ""0"" is the only value remaining on the right side of the equal sign.Example A: Change the following equation to standard form: x5 = -9

Example B: Change the following equation to standard form: y4 = 24

, To move terms, you will need to either add or subtract them from both sides of the equation.


The correct mathematical function will depend on what you need to do to leave nothing but a ""0"" on the right side of the equation.

If a number on the right side of the equation is negative, add it to both sides of the equation.
If a number on the right side of the equation is positive, subtract it from both sides of the equation.



Example A: x5 + 9 = -9 + 9

Since the value on the right was negative (-9), you must add positive 9 to both sides of the equation.



Example B: y4 - 24 = 24 - 24

Since the number on the right was positive (24), you must subtract positive 24 from both sides of the equation.



, Solve both sides of the equation. Once the only value on the right side is ""0,"" you have the standard form of the equation.



Example A: x5 + 9 = 0

Example B: y4 - 24 = 0

Look at the original equation.,
Shift all the terms to one side, if necessary.,
Rearrange the variable terms.,
Write your final answer.",How to Do Standard Form4," If you have a polynomial, or an equation with multiple variable terms in it, the standard form of that equation is to arrange the variable terms so that degrees of each term flow from highest to lowest.



Example: Change the following into standard form: 8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5 = 10

, The equation may or may not already follow the standard form of a variable equation. If it does not, you will need to shift all terms to the left side so that only ""0"" remains on the right side of the equal sign.


Do this by following the same steps outlined in the ""Standard Form of a Variable Equation"" section. Add or subtract values to both sides of the equation nothing but ""0"" remains on the right side.
8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5- 10 = 10 - 10

8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5 - 10 = 0



, To put this equation in standard form, you will need to rearrange the terms so that the highest variable is first and the remaining variables descend in order.


If there is a non-variable term in your equation, it must be the last one.
You must also make sure that each variable keeps its charge (positive or negative) when you move it.

Example: 8x + 2x3 - 4x4 + 7x2 + x5 - 10

x5 - 4x4 + 2x3 + 7x2 + 8x - 10 = 0



, Once the variables are arranged in descending order, you have the standard form of the equation.



Example: The standard form of the equation is: x5 - 4x4 + 2x3 + 7x2 + 8x - 10 = 0

Note the standard form of linear equations.,
Look at the original equation.,
Remove any fractions.,
Isolate the constant.,
Rearrange the variables.,
Make the lead coefficient positive.,
Write your final answer.",How to Do Standard Form5," When dealing with a linear equation, the standard form of that equation should follow the form: Ax + By = C


Additionally, A must not be negative, neither A nor B should be ""0,"" and A, B, and C should all be integers (not decimals or fractions).
This form can also be referred to as the ""general form"" of a linear equation.

, The equation should have three terms. One term should include an ""x"" variable, one should include a ""y"" variable, and one should have no variable (this is called a ""constant"" term).



Example: Change the following to standard form: y/2 = 7x - 4

, Since all of the terms must be integers, you cannot have any fractions in the equation. If there is a fraction somewhere in your equation, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator of that fraction to get rid of it.Example: 2 * (3y/2) = (7x - 4) * 2

3y = 14x - 8



, You must isolate the constant, C, to the right side of the equal sign. If there are any other terms on the same side of the equal sign as the constant, add or subtract those terms from both sides of the equation to shift them to the left side.



Example: 3y = 14x - 8

The constant here is ""-8."" Since ""14x"" appears on the same side of the equal sign, you must subtract it from both sides of the equation.
3y - 14x = 14x - 8 - 14x
3y - 14x = -8



, Rewrite the equation so that the variables are all in the proper order according to standard form (Ax + By = C).


Make sure that each term keeps its charge (positive or negative) as you move it.

Example: 3y - 14x = -8

-14x + 3y = -8



, Recall that the A term cannot be negative. If it currently is, you must multiply both sides of the equation by ""-1"" to remove the negative.Example: -1 * 14x - 3y = 8



, You should now have the standard form of your linear equation.



Example: The standard form of the equation is: 14x - 3y = 8

Know the standard form for quadratic equations.,
Look at the original equation.,
Expand the equation.,
Shift all terms to the left side.,
Write your final answer.",How to Do Standard Form6," When you have a quadratic equation, or an equation with an x2 term, the standard form of that equation is: Ax2 + Bx + C = 0


Note that A must not equal ""0"" in this equation.

, There must be an x2 value somewhere in that equation. If there is, you can use this version of standard form.


Sometimes the x2 value is not obvious at first glance. If solving or expanding part of the equation can result in that term, however, this version of standard form still applies.

Example: Change the following into standard form: x * (2x + 5) = -11

, If you must expand part of the equation to reveal the x2 term, do so now.


If no expansion is necessary, you can skip this step.

Example: x * (2x + 5) = -11

Multiply the value in parentheses by the value outside of the parentheses to expand the equation.
2x2 + 5x = -11



, You need to shift all terms to the left side of the equation, leaving nothing but ""0"" to the right of the equal sign. Do this by adding or subtracting the terms to the right of the equal sign to both sides of the equation.


'Example: 2x2 + 5x + 11 = -11 + 11

2x2 + 5x + 11 = 0



, You should now have the standard form of the quadratic equation. Compare it to the formula (Ax2 + Bx + C = 0) to verify. If it follows this form, your answer should be correct.



Example: The standard form of this equation is: 2x2 + 5x + 11 = 0

Identify the question.,
Draw diagrams.,
Study proofs of related theorems.,
Ask questions.",How to Do Math Proofs1," You must first determine exactly what it is you are trying to prove. This question will also serve as the final statement in the proof. In this step, you also want to define the assumptions that you will be working under. Identifying the question and the necessary assumptions gives you a starting point to understanding the problem and working the proof.;
, When trying to understand the inner working of a math problem, sometimes the easiest way is to draw a diagram of what is happening. Diagrams are particularly important in geometry proofs, as they help you visualize what you are actually trying to prove.


Use the information given in the problem to sketch a drawing of the proof. Label the knowns and unknowns.
As you work through the proof, draw in necessary information that provides evidence for the proof.

, Proofs are difficult to learn to write, but one excellent way to learn proofs is to study related theorems and how those were proved.


Realize that a proof is just a good argument with every step justified. You can find many proofs to study online or in a textbook., It’s perfectly okay to get stuck on a proof. Ask your teacher or fellow classmates if you have questions. They might have similar questions and you can work through the problems together. It’s better to ask and get clarification than to stumble blindly through the proof.


Meet with your teacher out of class for extra instruction.

Define mathematical proofs.,
Know your audience.,
Identify the type of proof you are writing.,
Write the two-column proof as an outline.,
Convert the two-column proof to a formal written proof.",How to Do Math Proofs2," A mathematical proof is a series of logical statements supported by theorems and definitions that prove the truth of another mathematical statement.Proofs are the only way to know that a statement is mathematically valid.


Being able to write a mathematical proof indicates a fundamental understanding of the problem itself and all of the concepts used in the problem.
Proofs also force you to look at mathematics in a new and exciting way. Just by trying to prove something you gain knowledge and understanding even if your proof ultimately doesn’t work.

, Before writing a proof, you need to think about the audience that you’re writing for and what information they already know. If you are writing a proof for publication, you will write it differently than writing a proof for your high school math class.Knowing your audience allows you to write the proof in a way that they will understand given the amount of background knowledge that they have.

, There are a few different types of proofs and the one you choose depends on your audience and the assignment. If you’re unsure which version to use, ask your teacher for guidance. In high school, you may not be expected to write a formal proof.A two-column proof is a setup that puts givens and statements in one column and the supporting evidence next to it in a second column. They are very commonly used in geometry.
A formal proof uses grammatically correct statements and no symbols. At higher levels, you should always use a formal proof.

, You can use a two-column proof to as an outline of your formal proof before you write it. The two-column proof is an easy way to organize your thoughts and think through the problem. Draw a line down the middle of the page and write all givens and statements on the left side. Write the corresponding definitions/theorems on the right side, next to the givens they support.


For example:Angle A and angle B form a linear pair. Given.
Angle ABC is straight. Definition of a straight angle.
Angle ABC measures 180°. Definition of a line.
Angle A + Angle B = Angle ABC. Angle addition postulate.
Angle A + Angle B = 180°. Substitution.
Angle A supplementary to Angle B. Definition of supplementary angles.
Q.E.D.

, Using the two-column proof as a foundation, write the formal paragraph form of your proof without too many symbols and abbreviations.


For example: Let angle A and angle B be linear pairs. By hypothesis, angle A and angle B are supplementary. Angle A and angle B form a straight line because they are linear pairs. A straight line is defined as having an angle measure of 180°. Given the angle addition postulate, angles A and B sum together to form line ABC. Through substitution, angles A and B sum together to 180°, therefore they are supplementary angles. Q.E.D.

"
"
Learn the vocabulary of a proof.,
Write down all givens.,
Define all variables.,
Work through the proof backwards.,
Order your steps logically.,
Avoid using arrows and abbreviations in the written proof.,
Support all statements with a theorem, law, or definition.,
End with a conclusion or Q.E.D.",How to Do Math Proofs3," There are certain statements and phrases that you will see over and over in a mathematical proof. These are phrases that you need to be familiar with and know how to use properly when writing your own proof.“If A, then B” statements mean that you must prove whenever A is true, B must also be true.“A if and only if B” means that you must prove that A and B are true and false at the same time. Prove both “if A, then B” and “if not A, then not B”.
“A only if B” is equivalent to “if A, then B”, so it is not frequently used. It is good to be aware of it though, in case you see it.
When composing the proof, avoid using “I”, but use “we” instead., When composing a proof, the first step is to identify and write down all of the givens. This is the best place to start because it helps you think through what is known and what information you will need to complete the proof. Read through the problem and write down each given.


For example: Prove that two angles (angle A and angle B) forming a linear pair are supplementary.Givens: angle A and angle B are a linear pair
Prove: angle A is supplementary to angle B

, In addition to writing the givens, it is helpful to define all of the variables. Write the definitions at the beginning of the proof to avoid confusion for the reader. If variables are not defined, a reader can easily get lost when trying to understand your proof.


Don’t use any variables in your proof that haven’t been defined.
For example: Variables are the angle measure of angle A and measure of angle B.

, It’s often easiest to think through the problem backwards. Start with the conclusion, what you’re trying to prove, and think about the steps that can get you to the beginning.Manipulate the steps from the beginning and the end to see if you can make them look like each other. Use the givens, definitions you have learned, and proofs that are similar to the one you’re working on.
Ask yourself questions as you move along. ""Why is this so?"" and ""Is there any way this can be false?"" are good questions for every statement or claim.
Remember to rewrite the steps in the proper order for the final proof.
For example: If angle A and B are supplementary, they must sum to 180°. The two angles combine together to form line ABC. You know they make a line because of the definition of a linear pairs. Because a line is 180°, you can use substitution to prove that angle A and angle B add up to 180°.

, Start the proof at the beginning and work towards the conclusion. Although it is helpful to think about the proof by starting with the conclusion and working backwards, when you actually write the proof, state the conclusion at the end.It needs to flow from one statement to the other, with support for each statement, so that there is no reason to doubt the validity of your proof.


Start by stating the assumptions you are working with.
Include simple and obvious steps so a reader doesn’t have to wonder how you got from one step to another.
Writing multiple drafts for your proofs is not uncommon. Keep rearranging until all of the steps are in the most logical order.
For example: Start with the beginning.

Angle A and angle B form a linear pair.
Angle ABC is straight.
Angle ABC measures 180°.
Angle A + Angle B = Angle ABC.
Angle A + Angle B = Angle 180°.
Angle A is supplementary to Angle B.



, When you are sketching out the plan for your proof, you can use shorthand and symbols, but when writing the final proof, symbols such as arrows can confuse the reader. Instead, use words like “then” or “therefore”.Exceptions to using abbreviations include, e.g. (for example) and i.e. (that is), but be sure that you are using them properly., A proof is only as good as the evidence used. You cannot make a statement without supporting it with a definition. Reference other proofs that are similar to the one you are working on for example evidence.


Try to apply your proof to a case where it should fail, and see whether it actually does. If it doesn’t fail, rework the proof so that it does.
Many geometric proofs are written as a two-column proof, with the statement and the evidence. A formal mathematical proof for publication is written as a paragraph with proper grammar.

, The last statement of the proof should be the concept you were trying to prove. Once you have made this statement, ending the proof with a final concluding symbol such as Q.E.D. or a filled-in square indicates that the proof is completely finished.Q.E.D. (quod erat demonstrandum, which is Latin for ""which was to be shown"").
If you're not sure if your proof is correct, just write a few sentences saying what your conclusion was and why it is significant.

Draw the actual plot on paper or in drawing software on your computer.,
Label the plot.,
Draw the data out onto the plot.,
Understand how to read the plot.",How to Draw a Dot Plot1," To begin your basic Dot Plot, draw a line long enough to hold all of your data.;
, Labeling your plot will need to be done on the bottom, under the line you drew. Choosing whether to use Numbers or Words will depend on what your data consists of.


Numbers should be used when your problem looks like this: ""How long does it take you to eat breakfast?""
Words should be used when your problem looks like this: ""We asked Jack, Anna, and Flickety to guess how many wikiHowian friends they have. Anna said 100, Jack said 101, and Flickety said 102. So instead of numbers at the bottom, you'd use the names of the wikiHow Admins listed in the problem instead.

, After labeling and or numbering your Dot Plot, you now must place the data onto the table.


For Example: If your dot plot problem says something such as this: ""Krystle was asked how many cookies she gave Adelaide from 5pm to 10pm. She said she gave her 2 cookies at 5pm, 4 cookies at 6pm, 1 cookie at 7pm, 6 cookies' at 8pm, 5 cookies at 9pm, and 1 cookie at 10pm."" then your Dot Plot should look just like the one in the picture above.

, Referring to the image within the step above, each dot was placed on the corresponding time of day representing 1 cookie per dot:



Adelaide received 6 cookies at 8pm, therefore eight dots have been placed onto the Dot Plot above ""8pm"".
In this example, 1 dot is equivalent to 1 cookie. As for most dot plots, the dots will more than likely be equal to 1 of something (x = 1).

"
"
Compared to the Dot Plot.,
Creating the 'One-Dot' is very simple, it may require a little bit more work but it's worth it when it comes to saving you time.,
This time you will be labeling the left side of the plot as well as the bottom, opposed to just labeling the bottom.,
Just as you would do to the dot plot, you must label the bottom depending on your data that you have.,
Finished.

",How to Draw a Dot Plot2," The 'One-Dot' Dot Plot is very similar to the Dot Plot. It's much easier to work with compared to the other. In the following image; You may notice that multiple dots are used. Meanwhile, the One-Dot uses one dot to represent the data.

, This time, instead of drawing one line, a simple rectangular box must be drawn.

, On the left side of the rectangle you drew, you will need to label it with numbers, going up to the highest number you've been given.


For example; If the highest number you have been given is 3, then the side should be numbered: 0, 1, 2, 3 (Going no higher than 3).

, If your data requires numbers then you must label it with numbers, and if words are necessary then those will need to be used instead.

Evaluate your performance.",How to Do Well on Math Contests Like the AMC," Someone who wants to get a 150 on the AMC is going to have a different way of training than someone just looking to qualify for the AIME. Know your goal, and you can prepare for it well.;
, All math contests need a source of questions, and oftentimes the same types of questions appear over and over again. Just this year, the AIME II had a geometry question almost identical to one on an AIME a while back. The AMC returns to the same themes and question types year after year.

, The best way to get good at something is to do it, right? So go ahead and enter some math contests. You would be surprised how many there are out there, and the experience you can gain is invaluable. Remember, different contests teach you different skills-USAMTS is going to teach you how to write proofs, while ARML individual round tests are going to test your speed.

, Say you take a practice AMC from a few years ago, and you can't get any geometry problem in the last 10 questions or so. Well, it sounds like you need to work on your geometry skills. Beef up on theorems and do some basic problems that apply these theorems. Books like Art of Problem Solving are excellent for this-–they have theorems presented, and then problems that you can try applying them in. Remember, the only way to learn how to solve problems is to solve some.

, A few weeks before the real test, do a few timed sessions of old tests you have never seen before. Make it as true to the actual test experience as possible. Make an answer sheet and fill in the bubbles just like they will be when you take the test. This might make you realise how long or short the test really will feel like.

, Chances are, you will stumble on a couple that you can't get or that really get you interested––and you don't need any extra distractions.

, A tired brain does not think as well as a well rested brain.

, Have pencils, and also a ruler, protractor, or compass if you feel you might need it. Plan for every contingency. Bring tissues.

, If you've prepared, you have every right to feel confident. Chances are, 99 percent of the people you are taking the test with (especially the AMC level) haven't prepared as much as you, and that gives you the edge.

, Fill in the information carefully and completely.

, That way, you won't have to worry about calculating how many minutes you have left with an analog clock on the wall––one less thing to worry about.

, If you want, divide the scrap paper into parts with a box for each question to keep your work organised. You can also make boxes for each question as you go.

, The proctor has finished checking to see that everyone is ready. She looks at the clock and waits for the second hand to get to the top of the minute. A few minutes later and she says - ""You may begin.""

, Here is where the training should kick in. You should start at the beginning, and read the first question. Don't read it so fast you miss details; this is a possibility if it is a speed test. Read slowly and deliberately, and solve the problem on the scrap paper. When you finish, read the problem again, and make sure you did what they wanted. Once you are sure, bubble it in or otherwise, and continue. Depending on the contest, the act of solving the problem could take 30 seconds to an hour. That is the part that should be savored––the actual solving process. Hopefully, you will be able to solve the problems easily at first, and you will find elements of problems that you have done or practiced before. Hopefully also you will discover solutions to problems you have never seen before, and you will wonder in awe at their elegance. After all, that is what math contests are all about.

, If you still can't solve it, skip it and do it later. In lower level contests, there is usually a trick or an easy way to solve the problems. Remember that 99% of the time, you will use all of the information given to you, so if you haven't used something, think about how you might. Oftentimes, one more look will make you realize that there is a solution after all, and it isn't such a hard problem.

, Sometimes, you need to calculate whether to guess or not--be wary. If you have eliminated it down to 2, oftentimes the wrong answer will look much more appealing, especially up around AMC questions #20 and up. Make yourself have a logical basis for all your answers, and you will usually get the right answers.

, When time is winding down, and you scan back to previous work, you need to be able to read it. Don't let misreading a digit keep you from your goal.

, Why not push to the finish? Sometimes kids walk out of the AIME an hour early. Don't do that. If you re-energise yourself, and give yourself another boost of confidence, you can keep going. A mathlete in this sense is not unlike an athlete, with the test before you as an adversary. Don't give that piece of paper a fighting chance. You know there has to be a way to get every question, and this information alone should help you when tackling problems where you don't even know where to start.

, Just because you've never qualified for the USAMO doesn't mean this can't be the year. Just because you've never won the school title for the AMC doesn't mean you shouldn't be the kid who does. Someone has to do it every year and you have just as much chance as the kid last year. If you are intimidated by someone who you judge to be better than you, you are just putting another distraction on your shoulders you don't need. Never look over to see if they have already turned the page when you are still on the first question; you don't need to think about that because you only need to worry about what you can do.

, Turn in the sheet and get on with life. Hopefully, you saw some problems that interested you. Worry about your score when you get it––don't waste time worrying about it now. Chances are, your training and focus paid off.

, Did you make your goal? Was the test unusually hard or easy? Did you still miss a lot of geometry questions? Every test is an opportunity to improve. If you can take it again next year, analyse it and see how you can improve. But don't kill yourself over the stupid mistakes. Making one or more per test is normal, so take this into account when considering your goal. Just look at it and try to find a bright side.

Write your answer.",How to Do the Chunking Method," When given a division problem that cannot be solved using short division, you can use the chunking method to find the quotient.


This method is also called the ""partial quotients method"" because you are essentially finding the total quotient one part at a time. All parts will eventually be added together so that you can find the final, total quotient.

Example: Use the chunking method to find the quotient of 731 ÷ 5.;
, The ""easy"" multiples of your dividend are those that can be quickly calculated in your head.


Usually, they will be the multiples calculated when you multiply the dividend by the easy multipliers of 1000, 100, 10, 5, or 2., Determine the largest easy multiple you can calculate for the equation. You must multiply the divisor by one of the easy multipliers to come up with a number that is less than the value of the dividend.



Example: You can multiply the divisor, 5, by the multipliers of 100, 10, 5, and 2 to come up with a product that is less than the value of the dividend, 731. The largest of these multipliers is 100, so you would multiply 5 * 100 to produce an easy multiple of 500.


, Subtract the product or partial quotient you just found from the dividend. The difference between the two will be the next value that you work with.Example: You'll need to subtract 731 – 500. The answer is 231.

You'll have to break down the difference, 231, like you broke down the dividend, 731.



, Identify the next largest easy multiple and subtract it from the difference you just calculated. Repeat this process as needed until the difference between two subtracted numbers is either “0” or a number less than the original divisor.Example: The next easy multiple you can work with in this problem is 10, so multiply 5 * 10 to reach a product of 50.

Subtract 50 from the previous difference, 231, as so: 231 – 50 = 181
The easy multiple 50 can still be used since it is less than the new difference, 181. As such, you must continue to subtract by 50 until the difference is less than that value: 181 – 50 = 131 – 50 = 81 - 50 = 31
Identify the next highest easy multiple. The next best multiplier to use would be 5, so your next multiple would be 25 (5 * 5 = 25).
Subtract 31 – 25, which gives you an answer of 6.
The divisor, 5, can be subtracted as is from the difference, 6: 6 = 5 = 1
Since 1 is less than 5 (the original divisor), the calculations end here.



, When you are left with “0” at the end of your calculations, there is no remainder. Any number other than “0” that is smaller than the divisor would be a remainder, though.



Example: For this problem, there is a remainder of 1.

, You'll need to add all of the multipliers you used while chunking the equation to find your final answer. Multipliers used more than once must be added the number of times they were used. Any time you subtracted the actual divisor without multiplying it by a separate multiplier, you must add a 1.Example: In this equation, you used the multiplier 100 once, 10 four times, 5 once, and 1 once, so you must add together:

100 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 146



, Your final answer is the sum calculated in the previous step, along with any remainder identified in the step before it. The remainder should be proceeded with an “R.”



Example: The answer to 731 ÷ 5 is 146 R1


, This equation could technically be solved with short division, but if you don't know the answer already, you could still use the chunking method to find the correct answer.

, The easiest multiple is the largest possible easy multiple of the divisor. In this case, it would be 70.


You would find the multiple, 70, by multiplying 7 by the easy multiplier of 10.
Using a lower easy multiplier would give you a value that is smaller than necessary. Using a higher easy multiplier, like 100, would give you a multiple that is larger than the dividend, 84.

, The difference is 14.


Since 14 is still larger than 7, you need to continue you calculations further.

, If you've memorized your multiplication tables, you will already know that 7 * 2 = 14. Since the product of 7 and 2 is no larger than the difference calculated in the previous step, this product (14) is your next easiest multiple.


Note that the multiplier used here is 2, which happens to be one of the standard easy multiples.

, The difference between these values is 0.


When you reach a difference of 0, you have found all of the partial quotients you can find. The chunking portion of your calculations is complete.

, In this case, you would need to add 10 + 2, giving you an answer of 12.


You used the multiplier 10 once.
You used the multiplier 2 once.

, The answer to 84 ÷ 7 is 12.


Note that there was no remainder in this problem.

, Since this equation cannot be solved simply by using short division, it makes sense to use the chunking method of division to find the quotient.

, The largest possible easy multiple of your divisor, 72, would be 720.


This multiple is found by multiplying 72 by the easy multiplier 10.
A larger easy multiplier, like 100, would produce a multiple that is too large for the equation (7200) since the multiple must be smaller than the dividend, 931.

, The difference between the dividend and the multiple is 211.


Since 211 is larger than 72, you must continue chunking to find the final answer.
Note that 211 is smaller than 720, so you will need to find a new multiple to use.

, The next easiest multiple you can use would 144.


You need to use an easy multiplier smaller than the previous multiplier, 10.
The next highest easy multiplier is 5, but 72 * 5 = 360. Since 360 is larger than 211, this multiple cannot be used.
The next highest easy multiplier after that is 2, and 72 * 2 = 144. Since 144 is smaller than 211, this is the multiple you should use.

, The difference between the two values is 67.


Since 67 is smaller than the original divisor, 72, your chunking calculations must stop here.

, You'll need to add together 10 + 2, giving you an answer of 12.


Note, however, that there is also a remainder value for this equation: 67
The remainder must be included when you write your final answer.

, The answer to 931 ÷ 72 is 12 R67.

, Short division cannot be used to solve this problem, so using the chunking method can be a practical solution.

, The largest easy multiple you can use would be 1120.


This multiple is found by multiplying 112 and the easy multiplier 10.
A larger easy multiplier, like 100, would create a product that is larger than the quotient, so it cannot be used. A smaller easy multiplier would not be as practical, even though it could technically be used.

, The difference between the quotient and the multiple is 448.


Since 448 is larger than 112, you will need to continue chunking the equation.
Since 1120 is larger than the difference, 112, you can no longer use that multiple.

, The largest easy multiple you can use at this point would be 224.


You can get 224 by multiplying 112 * 2. In this case, 2 is the easy multiplier used.
Even though the multiplier 5 is smaller than the multiplier 10 and larger than the multiplier 2, 112 * 5 = 560. Since 560 is larger than 224, it cannot serve as an easy multiple in this problem.

, The difference between the two values is 224.


Notice that 224 is the same value as your chosen multiple. As such, you will continue to use 224 as your chosen multiple and subtract it from the difference.

, The answer is 0.


Since you've reached 0, there can be no further chunking for this problem.

, You must add 10 + 2 + 2, giving you an answer of 14.


You used the multiplier 10 only once.
You used the multiplier 2 a total of two times.

, The answer to 1568 ÷ 112 is 14.


Note that there is no remainder for this problem.

Enter the following into a new worksheet in a New Workbook or just use pencil and paper.

To be discussed are the 5 basic Neutral Operations:

1) a+b = a*b = c;
2) a-b = a*b = c;
3) a+b = a/b = c;
4) a-b = a/b = c; and
5) a*b = a^b = c.
In previous wikiHows, more complicated relations have been solved, e.g.,
The first equation neutralizes Addition versus Multiplication, i.e.,
The second equation neutralizes Subtraction versus Multiplication and is handled in much the same way as the first.,
The third equation is handled somewhat differently when neutralizing Addition versus Division.,
The fourth principle equation, neutralizing Subtraction versus Division, operates much like the third where we lose some discretion.,
Lastly, we have the principle neutral operation of a*b = a^b, which may be written down and learned from as follows:

1) a*b = a^b;
2) ab/a = (a^b)/a;
3) b = a^(b-1);
4) The root of (b-1) is taken of both sides so that b^(1/(b-1)) = a and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1.,
Many other side-excursions are possible, e,g, a+b = -a/b, etc, etc.,
What does f = m+a or E = m+c^2 mean?,
Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the Related wikiHows below and the article How to Do the Sub Steps of Neutral Operations for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation relating to Neutral Operations.",How to Do the Sub Steps of Neutral Operations,", a+b+c+...+z = abc...z and abcdefghi = a^(bcdefghi). Those will be referred to at the bottom in Related wikiHows.

, for the same two numbers a and b, a+b = a*b. The algebraic sub-steps to write down and learn are:

1) a+b = a*b = c;
2) a+b-b = ab - b;
3) a = b*(a-1) as b is factored out on the right side while the left side is simplified;
4) a/(a-1) = b as both sides are divided by (a-1) and the right side's (a-1)/(a-1) reduces to simply 1.
Now b has been isolated and defined in terms of a and 1. Since it was also possible to begin by subtracting a instead of b, and because both addition and multiplication are commutative, it's also true that b/(b-1) = a. And since ab = c, it is true also that a^2 / (a-1) = c and b^2 / (b-1) = c, which is very symmetrical.
It is well worth noting that the formula works wherever in Math or Physics one finds the relationship of c = ab, such as F = ma, or E = mc^2 or for a+b = c as in the Pythagorean Theorem, as a^2 + b^2 = c^2 can be set equal to a^2 * b^2 (or even a^2/b^2).
As a = b/(b-1), a is set to 5 and b then = 5/4. a+b = ab becomes 5+ 5/4 = 5 * 5/4 which both = 25/4. Check: the hypothesis holds. Neither a nor b may equal 1 lest 0 result in the denominator, for division by 0 is undefined.

, The algebraic steps to write down and learn are:

1) a-b = a*b;
2) a-b+b = ab + b;
3) a = b*(a+1) as b is again factored out on the right while the left is simplified;
4) a/(a+1) = b after both sides are divided by (a+1 and simplified. Now b has again been isolated and defined in terms of a and 1 but subtraction is not commutative so there is not a symmetrical relationship. If a is subtracted to start with instead of adding b, one obtains
2) a-a-b =ab-a;
3) -b = a*(b-1);
4) -b/(b-1) = a and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1.
5) -b/(b-1) * -1/-1 = b/(1-b) = a.
Letting b equal 5 again then with b/(1-b) = a, a = -5/4 and -5/4 - 5 = -5/4 *5 because -5/4 - 20/4 = -25/4, check.

, We need to be able to factor out a from the numerator, so we lose discretion. The steps to write down and learn are as follows:

1) a+b = a/b and since we must factor out a on the right, we must subtract it on the left;
2) a-a+b = a/b -a;
3) b = a*(1/b -1) factoring out a on the right and simplifying the left;
4) b/(1/b -1) = a as both sides have been divided by (1/b -1) and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1. There is no symmetry. Letting b = 5, for b/(1/b -1) = a then, 5/(1/5 -1) = a = 5/(-4/5) = -25/4 = a. However, since a/b = c, it's possible to set c equal to /b so that c = 1/(1/b - 1). Letting b = 5 and for c = 1/(1/b - 1), we have c = 1/(1/5 - 1) or 1/((-4/5) = -5/4 = c.
Testing the hypothesis of a+b = a/b = c, -25/4 + 5 = (-25/4)/5 becomes -25/4 + 20/4 = -25/20 which is -5/4 = c, check.. And c = 1/(1/b - 1) = 1/(1/5 -1) = 1/(-4/5) = -5/4, check also.

, The steps to write down and learn are as follows:

1) a-b = a/b and since a must be factored out on the right, it must be subtracted on the left;
2) s-s-b = a/b - a;
3) -b - a*(1/b - 1) factoring out a on the right and simplifying the left;
4) -b//(1/b - 1) = a can become, by multiplying the left by -1/-1, b/(1 - 1/b) = a and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1 by dividing through by (1/b -1). There is no symmetry.
However, since a/b = c, it's possible to set c equal to /b = c so that c = 1/(1 - 1/b) ... sort of the opposite of the above. Letting b = 5 and for a = b/(1 - 1/b), a = 5/(1 -1/5) = 5/(4/5) = 25/4 (whereas above a equaled -25/4).

Testing the hypothesis of a-b = a/b = c, 25/4 - 5 = (25/4)/5 = 25/4 - 20/4 = 25/20 = 5/4, check. And c = 1/(1 - 1/b) or 1/(1 - 1/5) = 1/(4/5) = 5/4, check again.



, Letting b=9, and for b^(1/(b-1)) = a then, 9^(1/(9-1)) = a and the left side evaluates in Excel to the value 1.31607401295249 = a.
Testing the hypothesis of a*b = a^b gives 1.31607401295249 * 9 = 1.31607401295249 ^ 9 and the first answer = 11.8446661165724 and the second value = 11.8446661165722, which is off just a smidgen, but acceptably so because of how Excel cuts off digits when calculating.
Because a*b = c and a = b^(1/(b-1)), then it is also true that b^(1/(b-1))*b or b^(1+(1/(b-1))) = c. 9^(1+(1/(9-1))) = 9^(9/8) and this answer = 11.8446661165724 = c, check.

A graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the graph is connected and all vertices have even degrees.;
,(Paths)


If a graph has exactly one vertex of odd degree, then it does not have an Euler path.
If a graph has more than two vertices of odd degree, then it does not have an Euler path.
If a connected graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree, then it has an Euler path. Any such path must start at one of the odd-degree vertices and end at the other one.,(finding an Euler circuit or path) A ""bridge"" on a graph is an edge whose removal disconnects a previously connected part of the graph. Fleury's algorithm can be summarized by the statement: ""don't cross a bridge till you have to"".

,


Take the given graph and add edges by duplicating existing ones, until you arrive at a graph that is connected and has all even degree vertices. This process of adding edges to a graph so as to make all degrees even is called Eulerizing the graph.
You then want to find an Euler circuit on the eulerized graph.
Create a path on the original graph by ""squeezing"" this Euler circuit from the eulerized graph onto the original graph by reusing an edge of the original graph each time the circuit on the eulerized graph uses an added edge.

Add and Subtract. Fractions can only be added, or subtracted, if they have the same denominator, otherwise the answer is incorrect. For example, 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5. To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, the first step is to find the lowest common denominator. For example, 3/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 + 1X2/2X2

= 3/4 + 2/4
= 5/4 or 1 1/4
3/4 - 1/3 = 3X3/4X3 - 1X4/3X4
= 9/12 - 4/12
= 5/12


Multiply. To multiply fractions, divide the numerator and the denominator by any common factors. Any mixed numbers should first be converted to improper fractions. To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal.

/9 X 3/4 = 8/9 X 3/4
= 2/3 X 1/1
= 2/3








1/2 \ 6/7 = 7/2 \ 6/7








= 7/2 \ 7/6

the reciprocal of 6/7 is 7/6.*


= 49/12

12 \ 49 = 4 R 1.*


= 4 1/12

That a difference equals a ratio or proportion is important because, in Nature, certain ratios or proportions are necessary and they may not always be constructed additively. An example of this is the space in the mouth or the spaces between teeth -- such a space is essential for the animal's survival but may not be created additively, only by making sure not too much is added in fact, i.e that a proportion is maintained as a difference. See Allometry and Spherical Cap in Wikipediafor information on how body mass varies and on the availability of united spherical or hyperspherical surfaces to reactants/solvents -- how these may be calculated and/or compared to expected values. Adding a coefficient to the above neutral operation is easily done.

Understand what unit rates are.,
Determine the unknown.,
List the given numbers in a fraction form.,
Do the required operations to find the unit rate.",How to Do a Unit Rate," First, we need to define a ratio, the relationship between two measurements or numbers.

The first form of a unit rate is made by simply taking one number and placing it over the other, as in division.



 


For example, if you want to express the statement, “There are 24 eggs in 2 dozens of eggs.” in fraction form it would be 24/2.


The second form is to use the phrase, “is to”, between the things you are comparing, to denote that they are a ratio.






If you take the example using this form, the answer would be, “24 is to 2”.


The third form is to use a colon to between the numbers that we are comparing; this is the standard ratio form.






The ratio form of the example is 24:2.


A rate is a special ratio that is composed of two different units or things; think of it as a ratio with words.
It's like describing what things are equal to in the simplest and most convenient form.






For example, there are 7.57 liters (2.0 US gal) in two gallons. We can write the statement as:


Unit rates are rates whose bottom number, or denominator, is equal to 1.






In other words, unit rates are basic rates defined for a single set – per hour, per minute, or per one meter. For example:;
, The unknown is what is being asked in the problem.


In order to determine the unknown, you need to read the problem carefully and sort out the data.
The unknown is usually preceded by the question part of the problem, indicated by: how, what, when, where, or who.
To determine the unit of the unknown, look for indications of measurements.
For example, if the question asks for distance, look for units like: meters, feet, inches, or centimeters; for mass: kilogram, gram, pound, or ton; and for time: seconds, hours, or minutes.
Try this sample problem: ""Find the unit rate of a train if it can travel 236 miles (380 km) in 4 hours. And find how far will the train travel in six hours.""






Since the problem asks for how far the train will travel, you can be sure that it is asking for the distance.






Out of the two units given: miles and hours, we know that miles is the unit for distance or displacement.







, After finding the unknown, sort out the data by dividing it into pairs with its appropriate units.


Read the problem and think about which number goes with what.
For easier calculations, you can place the unknown on the left hand side, and the other given data on the other side.
The unknown goes at the top of the division bar, or in the numerator’s place, and its partner goes at the bottom, or in the denominator's place.
Since we have another pair of given numbers, place the number with the same unit at the same place where you put the unknown.
The last piece of given data will go in the denominator's place.
The most important part is that the numerator should always be the same unit as the unknown you were looking for.
Returning to the example, since the unit of the unknown is miles, the given that should be adjacent to it should also be in miles.
Also, since the problem is asking for the unit rate, the denominator has to be 1 of whatever unit it is. So put 1 in the denominator:

, There are a number of ways in which you can solve these “double division” problems.

First, you can multiply the denominator of the left side by the numerator of the right side and divide that number by the denominator of the right hand side.






Alternatively, you can divide the right side first, and then multiply the denominator by the answer obtained.






The resulting unit rate will be a composite unit – two units that are combined by elementary operations, multiplication or division, to form one unified unit.
So, using the second method: dividing 236 by 4 and multiplying it by one:






Therefore, the train has a unit rate of 59 miles (95 km)/hour.
Answering the second question (And find how far will the train travel in six hours.), you can use another variable, ""Y"", to avoid confusion with the answers.






Since you know that the question is asking for the distance, you once again place the number that has units of distance in the numerator, and the remaining data in the denominator.






Another method is to just multiply the unit rate with the hours asked, since the unit is in a per hour basis.






Taking the unit rate of 59 miles (95 km)/hour and multiplying it by 6 hours yields the same answer.






So the train can travel 354 miles (570 km) in 6 hours.

Write your answer.",How to Do a Factor Tree," When you need to build a factor tree for a particular number, you need to start by writing that number at the top of the paper. This will be the tip of your tree.


Prepare the tree for its factors by drawing two downward diagonal lines beneath the number. One should point left and the other should point right.
Alternatively, you could place the number at the bottom of the tree and draw its factor branches up and above it. This method is far less common, however.

Example: Make a factor tree for the number 315.

.....315
...../...\

;
, Pick any pair of factors for the number you're working with. To qualify as a pair of factors, the product of the two numbers must equal your original number when multiplied together.These factors will form the first branches of your factor tree.
You can pick any two factors. The end result will be the same no matter which ones you start with.
Note that if there are no factors that equal the original number when multiplied together, other than that number and the number “1,” the number is considered a prime number and cannot be made into a factor tree.

Example:

.....315
...../...\
...5....63



, Break down your first two factors into their own sets of two factors apiece.


As before, two numbers can only be considered factors if they equal the current value when multiplied together.
Do not break down prime numbers any further.

Example:

.....315
...../...\
...5....63
........./ \
.......7...9



, You will need to break down each number as far as possible until you separate it into nothing but prime numbers. A prime number is a number that has no factors other than itself and the number “1.”


Continue as often as needed, creating as many branches as necessary in the process.
Note that there should be no “1” anywhere in your tree.

Example:

.....315
...../...\
...5....63
........./..\
.......7...9
.........../..\
..........3....3



, Since the prime numbers might be scattered throughout various levels of the factor tree, you should identify each one to make them easier to spot. Do so by highlighting, circling, or writing them down in a list.



Example: The prime number factors are: 5, 7, 3, 3

.....315
...../...\
...5....63
............/..\
.........7...9
............../..\
...........3....3



An alternate way of writing out the prime factors of a factor tree is to carry each prime factor down to the next level. By the end of the problem, you can spot each prime number because each one will be in the bottom row.Example:

.....315
...../...\
....5....63
.../....../..\
..5....7...9
../..../..../..\
5....7...3....3



, Typically, you would show the results of your work by writing out all of the prime number factors in a multiplication equation. Write out all of the numbers and separate each one with a multiplication sign.If you are instructed to leave your answer in factor tree form, however, this step is not necessary.

Example: 5 * 7 * 3 * 3

, Solve the new equation you just wrote. When you multiply all of the prime number factors together, the product you find should be the same as your original number.



Example: 5 * 7 * 3 * 3 = 315

, To find the greatest common factor (GCF) between two or more numbers, you need to start by breaking down each number into its prime number factors. You can use the factor tree method to do this.


You will need to create a separate factor tree for each number.
The process required for making a factor tree is the same as described in the “Making a Factor Tree” section.
The GCF between two ore more numbers is the largest prime number factor that is shared between all of the given numbers in the problem. This number must divide evenly into all of the original numbers in the problem.

Example: Find the GCF of 195 and 260.

......195
....../....\
....5....39
........./....\
.......3.....13
The prime factors of 195 are: 3, 5, 13
.......260
......./.....\
....10.....26
.../...\ …/..\
.2....5...2...13
The prime factors of 260 are: 2, 2, 5, 13



, Look at all of the factor trees created for your original values. Identify the prime factors of each original number, then highlight or write down all of the factor numbers that both lists have in common


If there are no common factors between the numbers, the GCF is the number 1.

Example: As noted previously, the factors of 195 are 3, 5, and 13; the factors of 260 are 2, 2, 5, and 13. The common factors between both numbers are 5 and 13.

,


If there is only one shared factor between two or more numbers, however, the GCF is simply that single shared factor.

Example: The common factors between 195 and 260 are 5 and 13. The product of 5 multiplied by 13 is 65.

5 * 13 = 65



, The problem is now complete, and you should have your answer ready.


You can double-check your work, if desired, by dividing each of your original numbers by the GCF you calculated. If the GCF goes into each number evenly, the solution should be accurate.

Example: The greatest common factor (GCF) of 195 and 260 is 65.

195 / 65 = 3
260 / 65 = 4



, To find the least common multiple (LCM) between two or more numbers, you need to break down each number in the problem set into its prime factors. Do so by using the factor tree method.


Create a separate factor tree for each number in the problem set using the method described in the ""Making a Factor Tree"" section.
A multiple is a value that the current number is a factor of. The LCM is the smallest value that can qualify as a shared multiple of all given numbers in the set.

Example: Find the least common multiple of 15 and 40.

....15
..../..\
...3...5
The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5.
.....40
..../...\
...5....8
......../..\
.......2...4
............/ \
..........2...2
The prime factors of 40 are 5, 2, 2, and 2.



, Look at all of the prime number factors of each original value. Highlight, list, or otherwise identify all of the factors that are shared among each of the factor trees.


Note that if you are working with more than two numbers, the common factors must be shared among at least two of the factor trees but do not need to appear in all of the trees.
Pair off common factors. For instance, if one number has “2” as a factor twice and the other has “2” as a factor once, you should count the shared “2” as one pair; the remaining “2” of the first number will be counted as an unshared digit.

Example: The factors of 15 are 3 and 5; the factors of 40 are 2, 2, 2, and 5. Among these factors, only the number 5 is shared.

, Once you have separated out each set of shared factors, multiply the shared factor by all of the unshared factors in each tree.


The shared factor is treated as a single number. The unshared factors are each counted, even if there are multiple occurrences of that digit.

Example: The common factor is 5. The number 15 also contributes the unshared factor of 3, and the number 40 also contributes the unshared factors of 2, 2, and 2. As such, you must multiply:

5 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 120



, This completes the problem, so you should be able to write down your final answer.



Example: The LCM of 15 and 40 is 120.

While it may certainly depend a great deal on costs, certain other factors come into play. Among these are:



Pricing policies per the demand curve and other considerations, such as growing the business at a certain pace.
Market research studies
Past sales volume
General economic and industry conditions
Relationship of sales to economic indicators such as GNP, personal income, employment, prices and industrial production
Advertising and other promotional budget
Quality of sales force
Competition
Seasonal variations
Production capacity






Long-term sales trends for various products, i.e. where in product life cycle it is.
Research and development allocations in the recent past - product improvements.;
, Products may not be sold under cost due to anti-trust regulations and legislation. Some costs have a mixed fixed-variable component basis, which is fine to allocate between so long as treated on a consistent basis between planning periods.

, For example, a manufacturer of ski apparel will have velcro that fluctuates with jackets and warmup pants sold, as well as seasonal changes in production, and fill, etc., as well as a color mix to consider (which may need to respond rapidly to changes in consumer tastes).

, For example, the ski apparel's unit price for a jacket might be $150 and the unit variable expenses $75, or 50% of the price. The unit variable costs include direct labor, machine production such as cutting and sewing 4 basic sizes for 2 sexes, then adult and children's, oil for the machinery and repairs to it as budgeted and are standard, etc. standard indirect labor such as color consulting, etc. The contribution margin of this jacket is $75 times the number of jackets projected to be sold, let's say 7812.5 (there are a few 1/2 size infant outfits made for special order). So that's $585,937.5 in total Contribution Margin towards Fixed Costs from this one jacket. Multiplied by 16 distributors of 8 jacket sizes and 8 pant sizes of 4 colors each size, that's 16*(32 + 32) * $585,937.5 = $600,000,000.00. We plan to increase our sales distribution marketing to 32 and double our sales if sales take off early in the season.

, The breakeven point equals the volume of sales it takes to cover all costs, and it is calculated by dividing the company's Fixed Costs by the Unit Contribution Margin (mixed, but here grossly simplified to be the same selling price and variable cost for pants and jackets, the only two products). For example, let's say the Fixed Costs for this Apparel Manufacturer are $300 Million. $300/50% = $600 Million Breakeven Point.

, Here, as mentioned, the Contribution towards Fixed Costs based on a reasonable sales projection of selling 7812.5 units of each of 8 jackets and 8 pants of 4 colors each at 16 distributors for $150/selling price per unit will total 1,200,000,000 and that our BreakEven Point is $600,000,000. You'll therefore anticipate a profit of $0 on sales of $150*7812.5* 1024 = $1,200,000,000.00, which is a ROS (Return on Sales) of 0%, and a Return on Fixed Costs of $0/300M = 0% -- so you can pretty much roll with seasonal changes every two years and stay right with the fast-moving market of ski fashion, in which there's almost always a role for the high-end warmup pants and jacket customer, and just break even.

, If we do increase our marketing efforts to 32 distribution points with sales of $2,400,000,000, we'll make a profit of $600,000,000 -- enough to purchase a new factory, or rather, set of Fixed Costs. The ROS would then be $600M/$2,400M or 25%, and the return to Fixed Costs would be $600M/300M or 200%.

, The Total Fixed and Variable Expenses line has been crossed at $2.4M (consisting of $600,000 in Fixed Expenses and $1.8M of Variable Expenses). So, by subtracting the Total Fixed and Variable Expenses of $2.4M form the Total Sales Revenue of $3.6M, one learns that the profit forecast equals the difference of $1.2M. At $0 of Sales, the Fixed Expenses of $600,000 must still be paid, and that would also be the amount of Loss incurred.

If you are trying to do your homework efficiently, consider how long it has taken you to complete similar problems in class, and extend the amount of time you allot to your homework accordingly. For example, if realistically you know you can complete one problem on your assignment in 2 minutes, you will need to give yourself an hour to complete 30 problems.

Completing 30 math problems in 15 minutes means you would spend an average of 30 seconds on each problem. Be honest about whether this is a realistic goal, considering the scope of the work.

If you try to cram a half-hour’s worth of work into 15 minutes, you will likely do a poor job and receive no credit for your efforts. Thus, you will have wasted 15 minutes trying to save time.

Additionally, math skills build sequentially. So, you will likely lose more time later because you do not fully understand how to do the work today that you need to know for tomorrow.
;
, The easiest way to do this is to divide 15 minutes (or however long you plan to spend on homework) by 30 (or however many problems you have to complete). Once you know how much time to spend on each problem, use a clock or watch to track your progress.If you realize you are spending too much time on a single problem, move on. You can always come back to it once you have finished the rest of the assignment.


, Sometimes teachers want you to show all of your work and will grade you on the process and strategies you use. Sometimes, you just need to find the correct answer. In this case, you don't need to waste time showing all of your work if there are certain calculations you can simply do in your head.

For example, you might have memorized that the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 right triangle is s2{\displaystyle s{\sqrt {2}}}. If your teacher doesn't need to see your work, there is no need to show how this answer is derived from using the Pythagorean Theorem. Simply write down your answer and move on.


, Scan the assignment and identify the problems you are confident about.Once you knock out these problems, you can recalculate your time budget by dividing the amount of time you have left by the number of problems you have left. You might find that you have more time for the harder problems once you complete the easy problems first.
, An easy way to waste time is by tackling a problem incorrectly. If you assume you know what you need to do without reading the instructions, you might find that you are nearly through solving a problem before you realize you are doing the work incorrectly and need to start over from the beginning.
, Sometimes homework problems will follow a sequence. If you can identify this sequence, you may be able to quickly write down your answers without calculating each one, or without even looking at the problems.

For example, you might be working with exponents. The first question in a section  might ask you to evaluate 6.4×101{\displaystyle 6.4\times 10^{1}}. The next problem might ask you to evaluate 6.4×102{\displaystyle 6.4\times 10^{2}}. If you scan the rest of the section and notice that each problem begins with 6.4, you can assume that in each problem, the exponent of 10 is increased by 1. So, you can simply go down your answer sheet and move the decimal in 6.4 one to the right each time.

Be very careful when looking for patterns. Sometimes, if you don't fully understand the work, you might see patterns where none exist. Other times, you might assume the problems are following a pattern, when they actually do not.


, Another big time waster when completing multiple-step problems is losing track of your calculations. Clearly identify the solution to each step as you work. This not only helps you work efficiently, but also helps when you need to go back and check your work."

Repeat the previous three steps on the interim quotient.",How to Divide Polynomials," How complicated the divisor (the polynomial you’re dividing by) is compared to the dividend (the polynomial you’re dividing into) determines which approach is best.

If the divisor is a monomial (single-term polynomial), either a variable with a coefficient, or a constant (a number without a variable following it), you can probably factor the dividend and cancel out one of the resulting factors and the divisor. See “Factoring the Dividend” for instructions and examples.

If the divisor is a binomial (two-term polynomial), you may be able to factor the dividend and cancel out one of the resulting factors and the divisor.

If the divisor is a trinomial (three-term polynomial), you may be able to factor both the dividend and the divisor, cancel out the common factor, and then either factor out the dividend further or use long division.

If the divisor is a polynomial with more than three factors, you will probably have to use long division. See “Using Long Polynomial Division” for instructions and examples.
;
, If looking at the divisor polynomial of the equation doesn’t tell you whether you should try to factor the dividend, look at the dividend itself.

If the dividend has three terms or fewer, you can probably factor it and cancel out the divisor. 

If the dividend has more than three terms, you will probably have to divide the divisor into it by using long division.


, If this is the case, you can factor it out and probably cancel out the divisor.

If you’re dividing the binomial 3x – 9 by 3, you can factor 3 out of both terms of the binomial, making it 3(x – 3). You can then cancel out the divisor of 3, leaving a quotient of x – 3.

If you’re dividing the binomial 24x3 - 18x2 by 6x, you can factor 6x out of both terms of the binomial, making it 6x(4x2 - 3). You can the cancel out the divisor of 6x, leaving a quotient of 4x2 - 3.


, Certain polynomials display terms that tell you they can be factored. If one of those factors matches the divisor, you can cancel it out, leaving the remaining factor as the quotient. Here are some patterns to look for:

Difference of perfect squares. This is a binomial of the form ‘’a 2x2 - b 2’’, where the values of ‘’a 2’’ and ‘’b 2’’ are perfect squares. This binomial factors into two binomials (ax + b)(ax – b), where a and b are the square roots of the coefficient and constant of the earlier binomial.

Perfect square trinomial. This trinomial is in the form a2x2 + 2abx + b 2. It factors to (ax + b)(ax + b), which may also be written (ax + b)2. If the sign in front of the second term is a minus sign, the binomial factors will be in the form (ax – b)(ax – b).

Sum or difference of cubes. This is a binomial of the form a3x3 + b3 or a3x3 - b3, where the values of ‘’a 3’’ and ‘’b 3’’ are perfect cubes. This binomial factors into a binomial and a trinomial. A sum of cubes factors down to (ax + b)(a2x2 - abx + b2). A difference of cubes factors down to (ax - b)(a2x2 + abx + b2).


, If you don’t see a discernible pattern in the dividend to tell you how to factor it, you can try several possible factoring combinations. You can do this by looking first at the constant and finding several factors for it, then at the coefficient of the middle term.

For example, if the dividend is x2 - 3x – 10, you would look at the factors of 10 and use the 3 to help determine which factor pair is correct.

The number 10 can be broken into factors of 1 and 10 or 2 and 5. Because the sign in front of 10 is negative, one of the factor binomials has to have a negative number in front of its constant. 

The number 3 is the difference between 2 and 5, so these must be the constants of the factor binomials. Because the sign in front of the 3 is negative, the binomial with the 5 must be the one with the negative number. The binomial factors are thus (x – 5)(x + 2). If the divisor is one of these two factors, that factor can be canceled out, and the remaining factor is the quotient.


, You write out the long division of polynomials the same as you do for dividing numbers. The dividend goes under the long division bar, while the divisor goes to the left.

If you’re dividing x2 + 11 x + 10 by x +1, x2 + 11 x + 10 goes under the bar, while x + 1 goes to the left.


, The result of this division goes on top of the division bar.

For our example, dividing x2, the first term of the dividend, by x, the first term of the divisor yields x. You would write an x on the top of the division bar, over the x2.


, Write the result of the multiplication under the leftmost terms of the dividend.

Continuing with our example, multiplying x + 1 by x produces x2 + x. You would write this under the first two terms of the dividend.


, To do so, first reverse the signs of the product of the multiplication. After subtracting, bring down the remaining terms of the dividend.

Reversing the signs of x2 + x gives - x2 - x. Subtracting this from the first two terms of the dividend leaves 10x. After bringing down the remaining term of the dividend, you have 10x + 10 as the interim quotient to continue the division process with.


, You’ll again divide the first term of the divisor into that of the interim quotient, write that result on top of the division bar after the first term of the quotient, multiply the result by the divisor, and then calculate what to subtract from the interim quotient.

Because x goes into 10x 10 times, you would write “+ 10” after the x in the quotient position on the division bar.

Multiplying x +1 by 10 gives 10x + 10. You write this under the interim quotient and reverse the signs for the subtraction, making -10x – 10.

When you perform the subtraction, you have a remainder of 0. Thus, dividing x2 + 11 x + 10 by x +1 produces a quotient of x + 10. (You could have gotten the same result by factoring, but this example was chosen to keep the division fairly simple.)

Skip the easy problems.,
Compare your answer to an estimate.,
Reward yourself.",How to Do 30 Math Problems in 15 Minutes2," You most likely answered the problems you were confident about correctly. If you have a strict time-budget, don’t bother checking your work on these problems. You might end up wasting time by second-guessing yourself.
, For the more difficult problems, go back and make an estimate about what the answer should be, then check the estimate against your solution. Doing this can help you quickly identify unreasonable answers.If your answer seems reasonable based on your estimate, don’t bother re-checking your work. Only re-check work that does not align with your estimate.


, If you complete your assignment adequately, choose a reward that is motivating to you. This can be social media time, ice cream, a TV show, or anything else you enjoy. Rewarding yourself is an important step, as it will help keep you motivated to focus and work efficiently in the future.Only reward yourself if you were focused, and if you completed your work accurately. Don’t reward yourself if you crammed too much work into 15 minutes and did not do an accurate job on your homework.

Pay attention in class.,
Find an appropriate place to work.,
Eat a snack.,
Gather all of your materials.,
Eliminate all possible distractions.",How to Do 30 Math Problems in 15 Minutes3," Focus and do the work in class, so that when you sit down to do your homework or take a timed test, you will understand how to approach and solve the problems. If you don’t pay attention in class, much of your homework time may be spent going back through your textbook and notes in order to reteach yourself how to do the work.
, It is helpful to do your homework in the same place each night. This will prompt your brain that it is study time, and it also takes away time you might waste trying to decide where to do your homework. The place you choose should also be quiet, as background noise can raise your stress levels, making it difficult to focus. Also make sure you sit in a comfortable chair when you work. Physical discomfort can also hinder your focus. You might also waste time trying to get comfortable when you should be working., Another big distraction when trying to do homework is a growling stomach. Make sure you eat before sitting down to do your homework, so that you are not distracted by eating. You might also want to drink a moderate amount of caffeine before working, as it can help increase your concentration. Make sure to fix yourself a glass of water and keep it at your table while you work. This way you don’t have to interrupt your work if you get thirsty while doing your homework.


, Make sure you have paper, a pencil, pencil sharpener, and a good eraser at the desk or table where you are working. Don’t forget any extra materials you might need, such as a ruler, protractor, or calculator. Again, the goal is to minimize disruptions while you work.
, Turn off your television. Resist the temptation to check your computer or phone while you work. Electronic gadgets and social media are good ways to keep yourself from getting your work done. Don’t use a computer to help you with your homework unless you absolutely need to. A computer will just present you with the temptation to check Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. If you do need to use the computer, try completing everything you can without it first.

A positive number divided by a negative number is always negative. This also is the rule when dividing a negative number by a positive number.For example:10÷5=2{\displaystyle 10\div 5=2}10÷−5=−2{\displaystyle 10\div -5=-2}−10÷5=−2{\displaystyle -10\div 5=-2}
;
, To do this, divide the integers as usual, and ignore the negative signs. A negative divided by a negative always equals a positive.For example:10÷5=2{\displaystyle 10\div 5=2}−10÷−5=2{\displaystyle -10\div -5=2}


, To do this, divide the numbers as usual, then add a negative sign to the quotient. A positive number divided by a negative number will always be negative, regardless of whether the number is a whole number or a fraction. The same is true when dividing a negative number by a positive number. Remember that dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.For example:58÷−4{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}\div -4}=58÷−41{\displaystyle ={\frac {5}{8}}\div {\frac {-4}{1}}}=58×−14{\displaystyle ={\frac {5}{8}}\times {\frac {-1}{4}}}=−532{\displaystyle ={\frac {-5}{32}}}


, To do this, divide the numbers as usual, and ignore the negative signs. A negative number divided by a negative number will always be positive, regardless of whether the number is a whole number or a fraction. Remember that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.

For example:−58÷−4{\displaystyle {\frac {-5}{8}}\div -4}=−58÷−41{\displaystyle ={\frac {-5}{8}}\div {\frac {-4}{1}}}=−58×−14{\displaystyle ={\frac {-5}{8}}\times {\frac {-1}{4}}}=532{\displaystyle ={\frac {5}{32}}}


, To do this, multiply the integers as usual, then add a negative sign to the product. A positive number multiplied by a negative number is always negative.For example:10×5=50{\displaystyle 10\times 5=50}−10×5=−50{\displaystyle -10\times 5=-50}10×−5=−50{\displaystyle 10\times -5=-50}


, To do this, multiply the integers as usual, and ignore the negative signs. A negative number multiplied by a negative number is always positive.For example:10×5=50{\displaystyle 10\times 5=50}−10×−5=50{\displaystyle -10\times -5=50}


, To do this, multiply the numbers as usual, then add a negative sign to the product. A positive number times a negative number will always be negative, regardless of whether the number is a whole number or a fraction.

For example:58×−4{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}\times -4}=58×−41{\displaystyle ={\frac {5}{8}}\times {\frac {-4}{1}}}=−208{\displaystyle ={\frac {-20}{8}}}


, To do this, multiply the numbers as usual, and ignore the negative signs. A negative number times a negative number will always be positive, regardless of whether the number is a whole number or a fraction.

For example:−58×−4{\displaystyle {\frac {-5}{8}}\times -4}=−58×−41{\displaystyle ={\frac {-5}{8}}\times {\frac {-4}{1}}}=208{\displaystyle ={\frac {20}{8}}}


, 224÷−7{\displaystyle 224\div -7}

Remember that a positive number divided by a negative number will equal a negative number.

Since 224÷7=32{\displaystyle 224\div 7=32}, you know that 224÷−7=−32{\displaystyle 224\div -7=-32}.


, A peregrine falcon can dive (lose height) at a rate of 320 km/hr. Assuming it can sustain this rate indefinitely, how long would it take a peregrin to reach a height of -240 km?

Remember that a negative number (-240km) divided by a negative number (-320km/hr) will equal a positive number (number of hours).

Since 240÷320=.75{\displaystyle 240\div 320=.75}, you know that −240÷−320=.75{\displaystyle -240\div -320=.75}. So the falcon would take .75 hours, or about 45 minutes, to dive 240 km.


, 710÷−6{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{10}}\div -6}

Remember that a positive fraction divided by a negative number will equal a negative number.

Since 710÷6=710×16=760{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{10}}\div 6={\frac {7}{10}}\times {\frac {1}{6}}={\frac {7}{60}}}, you know that 710÷−6=−760{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{10}}\div -6={\frac {-7}{60}}}.


, −56÷−3{\displaystyle {\frac {-5}{6}}\div -3}

Remember that a negative fraction divided by a negative number will equal a positive number. 

Since 56÷3=56×13=518{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}\div 3={\frac {5}{6}}\times {\frac {1}{3}}={\frac {5}{18}}}, you know that −56÷−3=518{\displaystyle {\frac {-5}{6}}\div -3={\frac {5}{18}}}.


, Jason spends 5 dollars on donuts every morning. How much money will he lose on donuts after 5 days?

Remember that a positive number (5 days) multiplied by a negative number (-5 dollars) will equal a negative number (money lost).

Since 5×5=25{\displaystyle 5\times 5=25}, you know that 5×−5=−25{\displaystyle 5\times -5=-25}. So Jason loses $25 after 5 days of buying donuts.


, −12×−5{\displaystyle -12\times -5}

Remember that a negative number times a negative number will always equal a positive number.

Since 12×5=60{\displaystyle 12\times 5=60}, you know that −12×−5=60{\displaystyle -12\times -5=60}.


, Rebecca has a whole pie in her refrigerator. Over the course of three days, her house guest sneaks into the kitchen and eats 16{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}} of the pie. How much pie has Rebecca lost?

Remember that a negative fraction (−16{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{6}}} of a pie) times a positive number (3 days), will equal a negative number (amount of pie eaten).

Since 16×3=36=12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}\times 3={\frac {3}{6}}={\frac {1}{2}}}, you know that −16×3=−12{\displaystyle {\frac {-1}{6}}\times 3={\frac {-1}{2}}}. So Rebecca has lost half of her pie.


, −47×−7{\displaystyle {\frac {-4}{7}}\times -7}

Remember that a negative fraction times a negative number will equal a positive number.

Since 47×7=287=4{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}\times 7={\frac {28}{7}}=4}, you know that −47×−7=4{\displaystyle {\frac {-4}{7}}\times -7=4}

, The steps of Neutral Operations for Addition vs. Multiplication are: a+b = ab; a+b-b = ab-b; a = b(a-1); a/(a-1) = b and b has been isolated and defined in terms of a and 1 but a may not = 1 lest division by 0 result in the denominator. Also, it's possible to start out by subtracting a from both sides instead of b, and because both addition and multiplication are commutative, it is also true that b/(b-1) = a. It's symmetrical, which is a hot property in math these days. For more on Neutral Operations, google NeuOps-Graphs01.

Plot the various (r,θ) points as found in the table.,
Join the plotted points with a smooth curve and you're done!

",How to Graph Polar Equations," Coordinates in polar equations are of the form (r,θ), where r represents radius and θ represents angle. This means you rotate θ radians around and go out r units.;
, Take any random values of θ (around ten values would suffice) and calculate r against each of them using the relationship given between r and θ. This will help you plot them out on a graph easier, because you can just refer to a table instead of having to come up with coordinates in your head.

, The equation will have two variables and a constant. If you are not given the equation, you cannot use this method.

For example, you might be given the equation yx=32{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{x}}={\frac {3}{2}}}.


, The equation is y=kx{\displaystyle y=kx}, where y{\displaystyle y} equals the y-coordinate of a point on the line, x{\displaystyle x} equals the x-coordinate for that same point, and k{\displaystyle k} is the constant, or slope of the line. Use algebra to rearrange the equation in the form of y=kx{\displaystyle y=kx}. If you can’t rewrite the equation in this form, the variables are not directly proportional. If you can, it proves that they are directly proportional.For example, if you multiply both sides of the equation yx=32{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{x}}={\frac {3}{2}}} by x{\displaystyle x}, the equation becomes y=32x{\displaystyle y={\frac {3}{2}}x}, which is in the form of y=kx{\displaystyle y=kx}, with 32{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}} being the constant.

D-D - T = D/T -D as D is subtracted from both sides.
-T = D(1/T -1) as the left side is simplified and D is factored out on the right.
-T/(1/T -1) = D as both sides are divided by (1/T -1) and the right side is simplified since (1/T -1)/(1/T -1) = 1. D has become isolated and defined in terms of T and 1 and T may not = 1 or 0, lest division by 0 result.
T/(1 - 1/T) = D as the left sides is multiplied by 1 in the form of -1/-1 and the denominator is rearranged. From this is obtained y = x/(1 - 1/x) or in B2 as =A2/(1-(1/A2)), entered above.
Entering 60 for T gives 60/(1 - 1/60) or 60/(59/60) = 3600/59 = 61.0169491525424 = D.
Testing the hypothesis: D - T - D/T = R?
D - T = 61.0169491525424 - 60 = 1.0169491525424 = R
D/T = 61.0169491525424 / 60 =  1.0169491525424 = R; check.
So that if T = 60 minutes and D = 61.0169491525424 miles (98.197261016949 km), Rate R is 1.0169491525424 miles (1.6366210169492 km) per minute. Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 60 gives 61.0169491525424 mph (98.197261016949 km/h) =  the Rate R. This is also true if one subtracts the time, 60 minutes, from the distance, 61.0169491525424 miles (98.197261016949 km), to obtain the Residual Rate of 1.0169491525424 miles (1.6366210169492 km) per minute.
This ""Residual Rate"" is positive for T>1 and otherwise is negative, infinite or non-existent. The chart clearly shows that Infinity will be asymptotically approached for values approaching closer and closer to 1, from either side of 1. Otherwise, slope y/x is somewhat greater than 1 for numbers greater than 1 and just less than 1 for values of y less than about -9.

Identify the x-coordinates of the first two points.,
Determine the factor by which the x{\displaystyle x} variable grows.,
Determine the factor by which the  y{\displaystyle y} variable grows.,
Compare the constants of the two variables.",How to Determine Whether Two Variables Are Directly Proportional2," You should be given a list of coordinates, or have a graph from which you can determine the coordinates of the points. If you don’t have the coordinates of points on the line, you cannot use this method.

For example, you might be given the set of points xy214263{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}x&y\\\hline \\2&1\\4&2\\6&3\end{matrix}}}

The x-coordinate of the first point is 2, and the x-coordinate of the second point is 4.


, To do this, determine which factor, or constant, the first x-coordinate is multiplied by to arrive at the second coordinate.

For example, if the first x-coordinate is 2, and the second x-coordinate is 4, you need to determine what you multiply 2 by to get 4:2k=4{\displaystyle 2k=4}2k2=42{\displaystyle {\frac {2k}{2}}={\frac {4}{2}}}k=2{\displaystyle k=2}So, the x{\displaystyle x} variable grows by the constant 2.


, Use the same two points you used to determine the growth of x{\displaystyle x}. Use algebra to determine the factor by which the two coordinates vary.

For example, if the first y-coordinate is 1, and the second y-coordinate is 2, you need to determine what you multiply 1 by to get 2:1k=2{\displaystyle 1k=2}1k1=21{\displaystyle {\frac {1k}{1}}={\frac {2}{1}}}k=2{\displaystyle k=2}So, the variable y{\displaystyle y} grows by the constant 2.


, If x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} changed at the same rate, or by the same factor, then they are directly proportional.For example, since the x-coordinates changed by a factor of 2 while the y-coordinates also changed by a factor of 2, the two variables are directly proportional.

, The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. When two variables are directly proportional, when graphed their line will cross through the origin. The origin is at the point (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)}, so the y-intercept of the line should be 0{\displaystyle 0}.

, Compare the coordinates with each other, and determine whether each coordinate changed by the same factor.That is, determine whether the constant (k{\displaystyle k}) is the same for both the x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} values.

For example, if the first point is (1,3){\displaystyle (1,3)}, and the second point is (2,6){\displaystyle (2,6)}, the x-coordinate changed by a factor of 2, since 1(2)=2{\displaystyle 1(2)=2}. The y-coordinate also changed by a factor of 2, since 3(2)=6{\displaystyle 3(2)=6}. Thus, you can confirm that the line represents two variables that are directly proportional.

Remember that if the variables are directly proportional, they will follow the pattern y=kx{\displaystyle y=kx}.

Use algebra to rewrite the equation.

Isolate the y{\displaystyle y} variable by dividing each side by x{\displaystyle x}:xyx=6x{\displaystyle {\frac {xy}{x}}={\frac {6}{x}}}y=61x{\displaystyle y=6{\frac {1}{x}}}



Assess whether the rewritten equation follows the pattern y=kx{\displaystyle y=kx}. In this instance, the equation does not, so the variables are not directly proportional. In fact, they are inversely proportional., Are the variables directly proportional?xy1339927{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}x&y\\\hline \\1&3\\3&9\\9&27\end{matrix}}}

Determine the growth of x{\displaystyle x}. Do this by finding the factor you multiply the first x-coordinate by to reach the second coordinate:1k=3{\displaystyle 1k=3}1k1=31{\displaystyle {\frac {1k}{1}}={\frac {3}{1}}}k=3{\displaystyle k=3}So, the x-coordinate grows by factor of 3.

Determine the growth of y{\displaystyle y}:3k=9{\displaystyle 3k=9}3k3=93{\displaystyle {\frac {3k}{3}}={\frac {9}{3}}}k=3{\displaystyle k=3}So, the y-coordinate grows by factor of 3.

Compare the factor, or constant, of the two variables. They both grow by a factor of 3. Therefore, the variables are directly proportional.


, Does the graph show direct proportion between variables?

Note whether the line is straight. Since the equation of the line is in slope-intercept form, it has a constant slope, meaning the line is straight. So potentially, the variables are directly proportional.

Determine the y-intercept. If the variables are directly proportional, the line will pass through the point (0,0){\displaystyle (0,0)}. The y-intercept of this line is the point (0,3){\displaystyle (0,3)}. So, the variables are not directly proportional.

Everything but the constant terms vanish, leaving y = 5/2. Expressing this as a coordinate pair, (0, 5/2) is a point on the graph. Graph that point.;
, Long divide the denominator into the numerator to determine the behavior of y for large absolute values of x. In this example, division shows that y = (1/2)x - (7/4) + 17/(8x + 4). For large positive or negative values of x, 17/(8x + 4) approaches zero, and the graph approximates the line y = (1/2)x - (7/4). Using a dashed or lightly drawn line, graph this line.


If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, there is no division to do, and the asymptote is y = 0.
If deg(N) = deg(D), the asymptote is a horizontal line at the ratio of the leading coefficients.
If deg(N) = deg(D) + 1, the asymptote is a line whose slope is the ratio of the leading coefficients.
If deg(N) > deg(D) + 1, then for large values of |x|, y quickly goes to positive or negative infinity as a quadratic, cubic, or higher degree polynomial. In this case, it probably isn't worthwhile to accurately graph the quotient of the division.

, A rational function has a zero when it's numerator is zero, so set N(x) = 0. In the example, 2x2 - 6x + 5 = 0. The discriminant of this quadratic is b2 - 4ac = 62 - 4*2*5 = 36 - 40 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, N(x), and consequently f(x), has no real roots. The graph never crosses the x-axis. If any zeros were found, add those points to the graph.

, A vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator is zero. Setting 4x + 2 = 0 gives the vertical line x = -1/2. Graph each vertical asymptote with a light or dashed line. If some value of x makes both N(x) = 0 and D(x) = 0, there may or may not be a vertical asymptote there. This is rare, but see the tips for how to deal with it if it occurs.

, When is it positive, negative, or zero? In the example, the numerator of the remainder is 17 which is always positive. The denominator, 4x + 2, is positive to the right of the vertical asymptote and negative to the left. This means that the graph approaches the linear asymptote from the above for large positive values of x and from below for large negative values of x. Since 17/(8x + 4) can never be zero, this graph never intersects the line y = (1/2)x - (7/4). Don't add anything to the graph right now, but note these conclusions for later.

, A local extremum may occur whenever N'(x)D(x)- N(x)D'(x) = 0. In the example, N'(x) = 4x - 6 and D'(x) = 4. N'(x)D(x) - N(x)D'(x) = (4x - 6)(4x + 2) - (2x2 - 6x + 5)*4 = 0. Expanding, combining terms, and dividing by 4 leaves x2 + x - 4 = 0. The quadratic formula shows roots near x = 3/2 and x = -5/2. (These differ by about 0.06 from the exact values, but our graph isn't going to be precise enough to worry about that level of detail. Choosing a decent rational approximation makes the next step easier.)

, Plug the x-values from the previous step back into the original rational function to find the corresponding y-values. In the example, f(3/2) = 1/16 and f(-5/2) = -65/16. Add these points, (3/2, 1/16) and (-5/2, -65/16), to the graph. Since we approximated in the previous step, these aren't the exact minima and maxima, but are probably close. (We know (3/2, 1/16) is very close to the local minimum. From step 3, we know that y is always positive when x > -1/2 and we found a value as small as 1/16, so at least in this case, the error is probably less than the thickness of the line.)

, Take care not to cross the x-axis except at the points already found in step 3. Don't cross the horizontal or linear asymptote except at the points already found in step 5. Don't change from upward sloping to downward sloping except at the extreme found in the previous step.

The x-axis goes left and right, the second coordinate is on the y-axis.
The y-axis goes up and down.
Positive numbers go up or right (depending on the axis). Negative numbers go left or down.;
, Remember that a graph has four quadrants (typically labeled in Roman numerals). You will need to know which quadrant the plane is in.









Quadrant I gets (+,+); quadrant I is above and to the left of the y-axis.
Quadrant IV gets (+,-); quadrant IV is below the x-axis and to the right of the y-axis. (5,4) is in quadrant I.
(-5,4) is in Quadrant II. (-5,-4) is in Quadrant III. (5,-4) is in Quadrant IV.

, Just go to (0, 0), which is the intersection of the x and y axes, right in the center of the coordinate plane.







, Let's say you're working with the set of coordinates (5, -4). Your x coordinate is 5. Since five is positive, you'll need to move over five units to the right. If it was negative, you would move over 5 units to the left.








, Start where you left off, 5 units to the right of (0, 0). Since your y coordinate is -4, you will have to move down four units. If it were 4, you would move up four units.








, Mark the point you found by moving over 5 units to the right and 4 units down, the point (5, -4), which is in the 4th quadrant. You're all done.








, If you have a formula without any coordinates, then you'll have to find your points by choosing a random coordinate for x and seeing what the formula spits out for y. Just keep going until you've found enough points and can graph them all, connecting them if necessary. Here's how you can do it, whether you're working with a simple line, or a more complicated equation like a parabola:









Graph points from a line. Let's say the equation is y = x + 4. So, pick a random number for x, like 3, and see what you get for y. y = 3 + 4 = 7, so you have found the point (3, 7).
Graph points from a quadratic equation. Let's say the equation of the parabola is y = x2 + 2. Do the same thing: pick a random number for x and see what you get for y. Picking 0 for x is easiest. y = 02 + 2, so y = 2. You have found the point (0, 2).

, If you have to make a line graph, draw a circle, or connect all of the points of a parabola or another quadratic equation, then you'll have to connect the points. If you have a linear equation, then draw lines connecting the points from left to right. If you're working with a quadratic equation, then connect the points with curved lines.









Unless you are only graphing a point, you will need at least two points. A line requires two points.
A circle requires two points if one is the center; three if the center is not included (Unless your instructor has included the center of the circle in the problem, use three).
A parabola requires three points, one being the absolute minimum or maximum; the other two points should be opposites.
A hyperbola requires six points; three on each axis.

, Here are the different ways that modifying the equation changes the graph:









Modifying the x coordinate moves the equation left or right.
Adding a constant moves the equation up or down.
Turning it negative (multiplying by -1) flips it over; if it is a line, it will change it from going up to down or going down to up.
Multiplying it by another number will either increase or decrease the slope.

, Consider the equation y = x^2 ; a parabola with its base at (0,0). Here are the differences you will see as you modify the equation:









y = (x-2)^2 is the same parabola, except it is graphed two spaces to the right of the origin; its base is now at (2,0).
y = x^2 + 2 is still the same parabola, except now it is graphed two spaces higher at (0,2).
y = -x^2 (the negative is applied after the exponent ^2) is an upside down y = x^2; its base is (0,0).
y = 5x^2 is still a parabola, but it gets larger even faster, giving it a thinner look.

Here are the parts of the parabola that you'll need to know:The focus. A fixed point on the interior of the parabola that is used for the formal definition of the curve.

The direct x. A fixed straight line. The parabola is the locus of points where any given point is of equal distance from the focus and the directrix.

The axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the turning point of the parabola. Each side of the axis of symmetry is a mirror image.

The vertex. The point where the axis of symmetry crosses the parabola is called the vertex of the parabola. If the parabola opens upward, then the vertex is a minimum point; if it opens downward, then the vertex is a maximum point.
;
, The equation of a parabola is y = ax2+ bx + c. It can also be written in the form y = a(x – h)2 + k, but we will focus on the first form of the equation in this example.


If the a in the equation is positive, then the parabola opens upward, like a ""U"", and has a minimum point. If the a is negative, then it opens downward and has a minimum point. If you have trouble remembering this, think of it this way: an equation with a positive a value looks like a smile; an equation with a negative a value looks like a frown.Let’s say you have the following equation: y = 2x2 -1. This parabola will be shaped like a ""U"" because the a value, 2, is positive.
If your equation has a squared y coordinate instead of a squared x-coordinate, then it will open up sideways, to the right or a left, like a ""C"" or a ""C"" facing the left. For example, the parabola x2 = y + 3 opens to the right, like a ""C"".

, Remember that the axis of symmetry is the vertical line that passes through the turning point of the parabola. It is the same as the x coordinate of the vertex, which is the point where the axis of symmetry crosses the parabola. To find the axis of symmetry, use this formula: x = -b/2aUsing the example, you can see that a = 2, b = 0, and c = 1. Now, you can calculate the axis of symmetry by plugging in the numbers: x = -0/(2 x 2) = 0.

Your axis of symmetry is x = 0.

, Once you have your axis of symmetry, you can plug that value in for x to get the y coordinate. These two coordinates will give you the vertex of the parabola. In this case, you should plug 0 in to 2x2 -1 to get the y coordinate. y = 2 x 02 -1 = 0 -1 = -1. Your vertex is (0,-1), which is the point at which the parabola crosses the y axis.The points of the vertex are also known as the points (h, k). Your h is 0 and your k is -1. If the equation for the parabola is written in the form y = a(x – h)2 + k, then your vertex is simply the point (h, k), and you don't need to do any math to find it beyond interpreting the graph correctly.

, In this step, you need to create a table where you put the values of x in the first column. This table will give you the coordinates you need to graph your parabola.


The middle value of x should be the axis of symmetry.
You should include 2 values above and below the middle value for x in the table, for the sake of symmetry.
In your example, put the value of the axis of symmetry, x = 0, in the middle of the table.

, Substitute each value of x in the equation of the parabola and calculate the corresponding values of y. Insert the calculated values of y in the table. In your example, the equation of the parabola is calculated as follows:


For x = -2, y is calculated as: y = 2 x (-2)2 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7

For x = -1, y is calculated as: y = 2 x (-1)2 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

For x = 0, y is calculated as: y = 2 x (0)2 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1

For x = 1, y is calculated as: y = 2 x (1)2 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

For x = 2, y is calculated as: y = 2 x (2)2 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7


, Now that you've found at least 5 coordinate pairs for the parabola, you're almost ready to graph it. Based on your work, you now have the following points: (-2, 7), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (1, 1), (2, 7). Now, you can think back to the idea that the parabola is reflected over the axis of symmetry. This means that the y coordinates of points that are direct reflections of each other across the axis of symmetry will be the same. The y-coordinates for the x-coordinates -2 and 2 are both 7, the y-coordinates for the x-coordinates -1 and 1 are both 1, and so on.

, Each row of the table forms a coordinate (x, y) on the coordinate plane. Draw all dots with the coordinates given in the table on the coordinate plane.


The x-axis goes left and right; the y-axis goes up and down.
The positive numbers on the y-axis are above the point (0, 0) and the negative numbers on the y-axis are below the point (0, 0).
The positive numbers on the x-axis are to the right of the point (0, 0) and the negative numbers on the x-axis are to the left of the point (0, 0).

, To graph the parabola, connect the dots given in the previous step. The graph of your example will look like a U. Make sure that you connect the dots using a curved line, instead of connecting them to look like line segments. This will create the most accurate image of the parabola. You can also draw arrows pointing upward or downward at each end of the parabola, depending on which direction it is facing. This will indicate that the parabola's graph will continue to move outside of the coordinate plane., Take the equation y = x2 +1. All you have to do is shift this original parabola up 1 unit, so that the vertex is now (0, 1) instead of (0, 0). It will still have the same exact shape as the original parabola, but every y-coordinate will be shifted up 1 unit. So, instead of (-1, 1) and (1, 1), you have (-1, 2) and (1, 2), and so on.

, Take the equation y = x2 -1. All you have to do is shift this original parabola down 1 unit, so that the vertex is now (0, -1) instead of (0, 0). It will still have the same exact shape as the original parabola, but every y-coordinate will be shifted down 1 unit. So, instead of (-1, 1) and (1, 1), you have (-1, 0) and (1, 0), and so on.

, Take the equation y = (x + 1)2. All you have to do is shift this original parabola to the left 1 unit, so that the vertex is now (-1, 0) instead of (0, 0). It will still have the same exact shape as the original parabola, but every x-coordinate will be shifted to the left 1 unit. So, instead of (-1, 1) and (1, 1), you have (-2, 1) and (0, 1), and so on.

, Take the equation y = (x - 1)2. All you have to do is shift this original parabola to the left 1 unit, so that the vertex is now (1, 0) instead of (0, 0). It will still have the same exact shape as the original parabola, but every x-coordinate will be shifted to right left 1 unit. So, instead of (-1, 1) and (1, 1), you have (0, 1) and (2, 1), and so on.

Factor the denominator of the function.,
Find values for which the denominator equals 0.,
Understand the meaning of the solutions.,
Review the meaning of a graph.,
Recognize asymptotes.,
Graph vertical asymptotes with a dotted line.",How to Find Vertical Asymptotes of a Rational Function," To simplify the function, you need to break the denominator into its factors as much as possible. For the purpose of finding asymptotes, you can mostly ignore the numerator.

For example, suppose you begin with the function x−25x2+5x{\displaystyle {\frac {x-2}{5x^{2}+5x}}}. The denominator 5x2+5x{\displaystyle 5x^{2}+5x} can be factored into the two terms (5x)(x+1){\displaystyle (5x)(x+1)}.

As another example, consider the function y=3x+1x2+2x+1{\displaystyle y={\frac {3x+1}{x^{2}+2x+1}}}. You should recognize the denominator as a simple quadratic function, which can be factored into (x+1)(x+1){\displaystyle (x+1)(x+1)}.

Recognize that some denominator functions may not be able to be factored. For example, in the equation y=x2−2x2+3x−1{\displaystyle y={\frac {x^{2}-2}{x^{2}+3x-1}}}, the function in the denominator, x2+3x−1{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x-1} cannot be factored. For this first step, you will just have to leave it in that form.

If you need to review factoring of functions, check out the articles Factor Algebraic Equations or Factor Second Degree Polynomials (Quadratic Equations).
;
, Still disregarding the numerator of the function, set the factored denominator equal to 0 and solve for x. Remember that factors are terms that multiply, and to get a final value of 0, setting any one factor equal to 0 will solve the problem. Depending on the number of factors that exist, you may find one or more solutions.

For example, if a denominator function factored as (5x)(x+1){\displaystyle (5x)(x+1)}, then you would set this equal to 0 as (5x)(x+1)=0{\displaystyle (5x)(x+1)=0}. The solutions will be any values of x that make this true. To find those values, set each individual factor equal to 0, to create two mini-problems of 5x=0{\displaystyle 5x=0} and x+1=0{\displaystyle x+1=0}. The first solution is x=0{\displaystyle x=0} and the second is x=−1{\displaystyle x=-1}. 

Given another example with a denominator of x2+5x+6{\displaystyle x^{2}+5x+6}, this could be factored into the two terms (x+3)(x+2){\displaystyle (x+3)(x+2)}. Setting each factor equal to 0 leads to x+3=0{\displaystyle x+3=0} and x+2=0{\displaystyle x+2=0}. Therefore, the solutions for this problem would be x=−3{\displaystyle x=-3} and x=−2{\displaystyle x=-2}.


, The work you have done to this point identifies values of x for which the denominator of the function equals 0. Recognize that a rational function is really a large division problem, with the value of the numerator divided by the value of the denominator. Because dividing by 0 is undefined, any value for x for which the denominator will equal 0 represents a vertical asymptote for the full function.
, A graph of a function is a visual representation of the values of x and y that are solutions to a given equation. The graph may consist of individual points, a straight line, a curved line, or even some closed figures like a circle or an ellipse. Any point that lies on the line could be a solution to the equation.

For example, a simple equation like y=2x{\displaystyle y=2x} will have infinite solutions. Written in pairs of (x,y), some possible solutions are (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), or any pair of numbers in which the second number is double the first. Plotting these points on the x,y coordinate plane will show a continuous straight line that appears as a diagonal that goes upward from left to right. To see more samples of this type of graph, you may want to review Graph Linear Equations.

A graph of a quadratic equation is one that has an exponent of 2, such as y=x2+2x−1{\displaystyle y=x^{2}+2x-1}. Some sample solutions are (-1,-2), (0,-1), (1,1), (2,7). If you plot these points, and others, you will find the graph of a parabola, which is a u-shaped curve. To review this type of graph, you can look at Graph a Quadratic Equation.

If you need more help reviewing how to graph functions, read Graph a Function or Graph a Rational Function.


, An asymptote is a straight line that generally serves as a kind of boundary for the graph of a function. An asymptote can be vertical, horizontal, or on any angle. The asymptote represents values that are not solutions to the equation, but could be a limit of solutions.

For example, consider the equation y=1x{\displaystyle y={\frac {1}{x}}}. If you begin at the value x=3 and count down to select some solutions for this equation, you will get solutions of (3, 1/3), (2, 1/2), and (1,1). If you continue counting down, the next value for x would be 0, but this would create the fraction y=1/0. Because division by 0 is undefined, this cannot be a solution to the function. Therefore, the value of x=0 is a vertical asymptote for this equation.


, Conventionally, when you are plotting the solution to a function, if the function has a vertical asymptote, you will graph it by drawing a dotted line at that value. In the example of y=1x{\displaystyle y={\frac {1}{x}}}, this would be a vertical dotted line at x=0.

Draw your line.",How to Graph an Equation1," To graph a linear equation, all you have to do it substitute in the variables in this formula.


In the formula, you will be solving for (x,y).
The variable m= slope. The slope is also noted as rise over run, or the number of points you travel up and over.
In the formula, b= y-intercept. This is the place on your graph where the the line will cross over the y-axis.;
, Graphing a linear equation is the most simple, as you don’t have to calculate any numbers prior to graphing. Simply draw your Cartesian coordinate plane.

, If we use the example of y=2x-1, we can see that ‘-1’ is in the point on the equation where you would find ‘b.’ This makes ‘-1’ the y-intercept.


The y-intercept is always graphed with x=0. Therefore, the y-intercept coordinates are (0,-1).
Place a point on your graph where the y-intercept should be.

, In the example of y=2x-1, the slope is the number where ‘m’ would be found. That means that according to our example, the slope is ‘2.’ Slope, however, is the rise over run, so we need the slope to be a fraction. Because ‘2’ is a whole number and a fraction, it is simply ‘2/1.’


To graph the slope, begin at the y-intercept. The rise (number of spaces up) is the numerator of the fraction, while the run (number of spaces to the side) is the denominator of the fraction.
In our example, we would graph the slope by beginning at -1, and then moving up 2 and to the right 1.
A positive rise means that you will move up the y-axis, while a negative rise means you will move down. A positive run means you will move to the right of the x-axis, while a negative run means you will move to the left of the x-axis.
You can mark as many coordinates using the slope as you would like, but you must mark at least one.

, Once you have marked at least one other coordinate using the slope, you can connect it with your y-intercept coordinate to form a line. Extend the line to the edges of the graph, and add arrow points to the ends to show that it continues infinitely."

, These are pretty simple, because they only have one coordinate. You will be given an inequality such as x<1 to graph. To do this, first find ‘1’ on your number line.


If you are given a “greater than” symbol, which is either > or <, then draw an open circle around the number.
If you are given a “greater than or equal to” symbol, either > or <, then fill in the circle around your point.

, Using the point you just made, follow the inequality symbol to draw a line representing the inequality. If it is ‘greater than’ the point, then the line will go to the right. If it is ‘less than’ the point, then the line will be drawn to the left. Add an arrow to the end to show that the line continues and is not a segment.

, Substitute in any number to equal ‘x’ and mark it on your number line. If this number lies on the line you have drawn, your graph is accurate.

Slope intercept form is y=mx+b, where m=slope and b=y-intercept.
Having an inequality present means that there are multiple solutions.

, Find the y-intercept and the slope to mark your coordinates. If we use the example of y>1/2x+1, then the y-intercept is ‘1’. The slope is ½, meaning you move up one point and to the right two points.

, Before you draw it though, check the inequality symbol that is being used. If it is a “greater than” symbol, your line should be dashed. If it is a “greater than or equal to” symbol, your line should be solid.

, Because there are multiple solutions to an inequality, you must show all possible solutions on your graph. This means you will shade all of your graph above or below your line.


Choose a coordinate - the origin at (0,0) is often the easiest. Make sure that you note if this coordinate is above or below the line you’ve drawn.
Substitute these coordinates into your inequality. Following our example, it would be 0>1/2(0)+1. Solve this inequality.
If the coordinate pair is a point above your line and the answer is true, then you would shade above the line. If the answer to the inequality is false, then you would shade below the line. If the coordinate lies below your line and the answer is true, then you shade below your line. If your answer is false, then shade above our line.
In our example, (0,0) is below our line and creates a false solution when substituted into the inequality. That means that we shade the remainder of the graph above the line."

Find ‘a,’ ‘b,’ and ‘c’.,
Find the vertex.,
Make a table.,
Make a table that has two rows and three columns.,
Use your table and formula to solve for the y-coordinates.,
Graph the coordinates.",How to Graph an Equation4," A quadratic equation means that you have at least one variable that is squared. It will typically be written in the formula y=ax(squared)+bx+c.


Graphing a quadratic equation will give you a parabola, which is a ‘U’ shaped curve.
You will need to find at least three point to graph it, beginning with the vertex which is the centermost point.

, If we use the example y=x(squared)+2x+1, then a=1, b=2, and c=1. Each letter corresponds to the number directly before the variable it sits next to in the equation. If there is no number before ‘x’ in the equation, then the variable is equal to ‘1’ because it is assumed that there is 1x.

, To find the vertex, the point in the middle of the parabola, use the formula -b/2a. In our example, this equation would change to -2/2(1), which equals to -1.

, You now know the vertex, -1, which is a point on the x-axis. However, this is only one point of the vertex coordinate. To find the corresponding y-coordinate as well as two other points on your parabola, you will need to make a table.

,


Place the x-coordinate for the vertex in the top center column.
Choose two more x-coordinates an equal number in each direction (positive and negative) from the vertex point. For example, we could go up two and down two, making the two numbers we fill in the other blank table spaces ‘-3’ and ‘1’.
You can choose any numbers you want to fill in the top row of the table, as long as they are whole numbers and the same distance from the vertex.
If you want to have a clearer graph, you can find five coordinates instead of three. Doing this is the same process as above, but give your table five columns instead of three.

, One at a time, take the numbers you have selected to represent the x-coordinates from your table and insert them into the original equation. Solve for ‘y’.


Following our example, we could use our chosen coordinate of ‘-3’ to substitute into the original formula of y=x(squared)+2x+1. This would change to y= -3(squared)+2(3)+1, giving an answer of y=4.
Place the new y-coordinate underneath the x-coordinate that you used into your table.
Solve for all three (or five, if you want more) coordinates in this fashion.

, Now that you have at least three complete coordinate pairs, mark them on your graph. Draw a connecting them all into a parabola, and you’re finished!

"
"
Solve the quadratic formula.,
Mark the coordinates on your graph.,
Connect the points on your graph.,
Shade the graph.",How to Graph an Equation5," A quadratic inequality uses the same formula as the quadratic formula but will use an inequality symbol instead. For example, it will look like y<ax(squared)+bx+c. Using the complete steps from above in “Graphing a Quadratic Equation,” find three coordinates to graph your parabola.

, Although you have enough points to make your complete parabola, don’t draw the shape yet.

, Because you are graphing a quadratic inequality, the line you draw will be a bit different.


If your inequality symbol was “greater than” or “less than” (> or <), then you will draw a dashed line between the coordinates.
If your inequality symbol was “greater than or equal to” or “less than or equal to” (> or <), then the line you draw will be solid.
End your lines with arrow points to show that the solutions extend beyond the range of your graph.

, In order to show multiple solutions, shade the portion of the graph in which the solution could be found. To find out which part of the graph should be shaded, test a pair of coordinates in your formula. An easy set to use is (0,0). Note whether or not these coordinates lie within or outside of your parabola.


Solve the inequality with the coordinates you’ve chosen. If we use an example of y>x(squared)-4x-1 and substitute the coordinates (0,0), then it will change to 0>0(squared)-4(0)-1.
If the solution to this is true and the coordinates are inside the parabola, shade inside the parabola. If the solution is false, shade outside of the parabola.
If the solution to this is true and the coordinates are outside the parabola, shade the outside of the parabola. If the solution is false, shade inside the parabola."

Examine your equation.,
Make the absolute value equal to 0.,
Make a table.,
Solve the inequality.,
Graph the points.",How to Graph an Equation6," The most basic absolute value equation will appear as y=|x|. Other numbers or variables may be involved though.

, To do this, make everything in the absolute value lines | | =0. If we use the example y=|x-2|+1, then we get the absolute value by making |x-2|=0. Then the absolute value becomes 2.


The absolute value is the number of points from |x| to ‘0’ on a number line. So the absolute value of |2| is 2, and the absolute value of |-2| is also two. This is because in both cases, ‘2’ and ‘-2’ are 2 steps away from zero on the number line.
You may have an absolute value equation where ‘x’ is alone. In that case, the absolute value is ‘0’. For example, y=|x|+3 changes to y=|0|+3, which equals to ‘3’.

, You want it to have two rows and three columns.


Put the first absolute value coordinate in the into the top center column for ‘X’.
Choose two other numbers an equal distance from your x-coordinate in each direction (positive and negative). If |x|=0, then move up and down an equal number of spaces from ‘0’.
You can choose any numbers, although ones that are near the x-coordinate are most helpful. They must also be whole numbers.

, You need to find the y-coordinate that pairs with the three x-coordinates you have. To do this, substitute the x-coordinate values into the inequality and solve for ‘y’. Fill these answers in on your table.

, You only need three points to graph an absolute value equation, but you can use more if you would like. An absolute value equation will always form a “V” shape on your graph. Add arrows to the ends to show that the line extends further than the edge of your graph."

Identify the values of a, b, and c. In a quadratic equation, the x2 term = a, the x term = b, and the constant term (the term without a variable) = c. Let's say you're working with the following equation: y = x2 + 9x + 18.,
Use the vertex formula for finding the x-value of the vertex.,
Plug the x-value into the original equation to get the y-value.,
Write down the x and y values as an ordered pair.",How to Find the Vertex of a Quadratic Equation1," In this example, a = 1, b = 9, and c = 18., The vertex is also the equation's axis of symmetry. The formula for finding the x-value of the vertex of a quadratic equation is x = -b/2a. Plug in the relevant values to find x. Substitute the values for a and b. Show your work:


x=-b/2a
x=-(9)/(2)(1)
x=-9/2

, Now that you know the x-value, just plug it in to the original formula for the y value. You can think of the formula for finding the vertex of a quadratic function as being (x, y) = . This just means that to get the y value, you have to find the x value based on the formula and then plug it back into the equation. Here's how you do it:


y = x2 + 9x + 18
y = (-9/2)2 + 9(-9/2) +18
y = 81/4 -81/2 + 18
y = 81/4 -162/4 + 72/4
y = (81 - 162 + 72)/4
y = -9/4

, Now that you know that x = -9/2, and y = -9/4, just write them down as an ordered pair: (-9/2, -9/4). The vertex of this quadratic equation is (-9/2, -9/4). If you were to draw this parabola on a graph, this point would be the minimum of the parabola, because the x2 term is positive.

Write down the equation.,
Divide each term by the coefficient of the x 2 term.,
Move the constant term to the right side of the equation.,
Complete the square on the left side of the equation.,
Factor the left side of the equation.,
Use this format to find the x and y coordinates.",How to Find the Vertex of a Quadratic Equation2," Completing the square is another way to find the vertex of a quadratic equation. For this method, when you get to the end, you'll be able to find your x and y coordinates right away, instead of plugging the x coordinate back in to the original equation. Let's say you're working with the following quadratic equation: x2 + 4x + 1 = 0., In this case, the coefficient of the x 2 term is 1, so you can skip this step. Dividing each term by 1 would not change anything. Dividing each term by 0, however, will change everything.

, The constant term is the term without a coefficient. In this case, it is ""1."" Move 1 to the other side of the equation by subtracting 1 from both sides. Here's how you do it:x2 + 4x + 1 = 0
x2 + 4x + 1 -1 = 0 - 1
x2 + 4x = - 1

, To do this, simply find (b/2)2 and add the result to both sides of the equation. Plug in ""4"" for b, since ""4x"" is the b-term of this equation.


(4/2)2 = 22 = 4. Now, add 4 to both sides of the equation to get the following:

x2 + 4x + 4 = -1 + 4
x2 + 4x + 4 = 3



, Now you will see that x2 + 4x + 4 is a perfect square. It can be rewritten as (x + 2)2 = 3

, You can find your x coordinate by simply setting (x + 2) 2 equal to zero. So when (x + 2) 2 = 0, what would x have to be? The variable x would have to be -2 to balance out the +2, so your x coordinate is -2. Your y-coordinate is simply the constant term on the other side of the equation. So, y = 3. You can also do a shortcut and just take the opposite sign of the number in parentheses to get the x-coordinate. So the vertex of the equation x 2 + 4x + 1 = (-2, 3)

Find the midpoint of the two points.,
Find the slope of the two points.,
Find the negative reciprocal of the slope of the two points.",How to Find the Perpendicular Bisector of Two Points1," To find the midpoint of two points, simply plug them into the midpoint formula: . This means that you're just finding the average of the x and y coordinates of the two sets of points, which leads you to the midpoint of the two coordinates. Let's say we're working with the (x1, y1) coordinates of (2, 5) and the (x2, y2) coordinates of (8, 3). Here's how you find the midpoint for those two points:=
(10/2, 8/2) =
(5, 4)
The coordinates of the midpoint of (2, 5) and (8, 3) are (5, 4).;
, To find the slope of the two points, simply plug the points into the slope formula: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). The slope of a line measures the distance of its vertical change over the distance of its horizontal change. Here's how to find the slope of the line that goes through the points (2, 5) and (8, 3):(3-5)/(8-2) =
-2/6 =
-1/3

The slope of the line is -1/3. To find this slope, you have to reduce 2/6 to its lowest terms, 1/3, since both 2 and 6 are evenly divisible by 2.



, To find the negative reciprocal of a slope, simply take the reciprocal of the slope and change the sign. You can take the reciprocal of a number simply by flipping the x and y coordinates. The reciprocal of 1/2 is -2/1, or just -2; the reciprocal of -4 is 1/4.The negative reciprocal of -1/3 is 3 because 3/1 is the reciprocal of 1/3 and the sign has been changed from negative to positive.

Write the equation of a line in slope-intercept form.,
Plug the negative reciprocal of the original slope into the equation.,
Plug the points of the midpoint into the line.,
Solve for the intercept.,
Write the equation of the perpendicular bisector.",How to Find the Perpendicular Bisector of Two Points2," The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b where any x and y coordinates in the line are represented by the ""x"" and ""y,"" the ""m"" represents the slope of the line, and the ""b"" represents the y-intercept of the line. The y-intercept is where the line intersects the y-axis. Once you write down this equation, you can begin to find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the two points., The negative reciprocal of the slope of the points (2, 5) and (8, 3) was 3. The ""m"" in the equation represents the slope, so plug the 3 into the ""m"" in the equation of y = mx + b.


3 --> y = mx + b =
y = 3x + b

, You already know that the midpoint of the points (2, 5) and (8, 3) is (5, 4). Since the perpendicular bisector runs through the midpoint of the two lines, you can plug the coordinates of the midpoint into the equation of the line. Simply plug in (5, 4) into the x and y coordinates of the line.


(5, 4) ---> y = 3x + b =
4 = 3(5) + b =
4 = 15 + b

, You have found three of the four variables in the equation of the line. Now you have enough information to solve for the remaining variable, ""b,"" which is the y-intercept of this line. Simply isolate the variable ""b"" to find its value. Just subtract 15 from both sides of the equation.


4 = 15 + b =
-11 = b
b = -11

, To write the equation of the perpendicular bisector, you simply have to plug in the slope of the line (3) and the y-intercept (-11) into the equation of a line in slope-intercept form. You should not plug in any terms into the x and y coordinates, because this equation will allow you to find any coordinate on the line by plugging in either any x or any y coordinate.


y = mx + b
y = 3x - 11
The equation for the perpendicular bisector of the points (2, 5) and (8, 3) is y = 3x - 11.

Check your work.",How to Find the Slope of a Line Using Two Points," Slope is defined as “rise over run,” with rise indicating vertical distance between two points, and run indicating the horizontal distance between two points.

, These can be any points the line runs through.

You can also use this method if you are given two points on the line, without having the line graphed in front of you.

Coordinates are listed as (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)}, with x{\displaystyle x} being the location along the x, or horizontal axis, and y{\displaystyle y} being the location along the y, or vertical axis.

For example, you might choose points with coordinates (3,2){\displaystyle (3,2)} and (7,8){\displaystyle (7,8)}.


, One point will be point 1, and one point will be point 2. It doesn’t matter which point is which, as long as you keep them in the correct order throughout the calculation.The first point’s coordinates will be (x1,y1){\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})}, and the second point’s coordinates will be (x2,y2){\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})} 


, The formula is riserun=y2−y1x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}. The change in y-coordinates determines the rise, and the change in x-coordinates determines the run., Make sure you are not using the x-coordinates, and that you are substituting the correct y-coordinates for the first and second points.

For example, if the coordinates of your first point are (3,2){\displaystyle (3,2)}, and the coordinates of your second point are (7,8){\displaystyle (7,8)}, your formula will look like this:riserun=8−2x2−x1{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}={\frac {8-2}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}}


, Make sure you are not using the y-coordinates, and that you are substituting the correct x-coordinates for the first and second points.

For example, if the coordinates of your first point are (3,2){\displaystyle (3,2)}, and the coordinates of your second point are (7,8){\displaystyle (7,8)}, your formula will look like this:riserun=8−27−3{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}={\frac {8-2}{7-3}}}


, This will give you your rise.

For example, if your y-coordinates are 8{\displaystyle 8} and 2{\displaystyle 2}, you would calculate 8−2=6{\displaystyle 8-2=6}.


, This will give you your run.

For example, if your x-coordinates are 7{\displaystyle 7} and 3{\displaystyle 3}, you would calculate 7−3=4{\displaystyle 7-3=4}.


, This result will give you the slope of your line.

For complete instructions on how to reduce a fraction, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}} can be reduced to 32{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}}, so the slope of a line through points (3,2){\displaystyle (3,2)} and (7,8){\displaystyle (7,8)} is 32{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}}.


, A slope can be positive or negative. A line with a positive slope moves up left-to-right; a line with a negative slope moves down left-to-right.

Remember, if the numerator and denominator are both negative, then the negative signs cancel out, and the fraction (and slope) is positive. 

If either the numerator or the denominator is negative, then the fraction (and slope) is negative.


, To do this, look at the rise and run you calculated for your slope. Starting at your first point, count up the rise, then over the run. Repeat counting up the rise and over the run until you reach your second point.

If you do not reach your second point, then your calculation is incorrect.

Write down the selected formula to begin calculation.","How to Find the Length of the Hypotenuse, Adjacent and Opposite Side of a Right Triangle"," The hypotenuse side of a right triangle is always the side opposite to the right angle. In order to find the length oh the Hypotenuse side we first need to recall the three trigonometric ratios. so: Sine of an angle = opposite side ÷ hypotenuse side, cosine of an angle = adjacent side ÷ hypotenuse side and tangent of an angle = opposite side ÷ adjacent side.
, In order to find the length of the hypotenuse side of a right triangle we simply eliminate the side which will not be used in the calculation., Eliminate the formulas containing opposite in the above triangle we are left with the cosine formula. Write down the formula, substitute the values in the formula and then simplify by transposition in order to obtain a value for the Hypotenuse., Known values should be on one side of the equation and the unknown on the other side., To find the adjacent side, start by removing the sine formula because it does not have an adjacent side in it. By comparing the cosine and tangent formulas to the question, determine which of the two is more suitable to be used. Remove the one which is not needed. Eliminate the tangent formula if the question does not have an opposite and if it does not have a hypotenuse remove the cosine formula., The diagram above provides an angle and the side opposite to it and we need to find the adjacent side so we use the tangent formula. Substitute the known values into the formula. Simplify by transposition in order to obtain a value for the unknown side., In order to find the opposite side, you first need to narrow down your selection of which formula to use by eliminating the one that does not have opposite. Cosine should be eliminated because it does not have opposite. Take the sine and tangent formulas and make a comparison between them and the given question. If the question does not have a hypotenuse then use the tangent formula and if it does not have an adjacent, use the sine formula., From the diagram above there is no adjacent, so use the sine formula. Substitute the known values into the formula. Simplify the equation by transposing to obtain a value for the unknown side."

Write down the equation of the hyperbola in its standard form.,
Set the equation equal to zero instead of one.,
Factor the new equation.,
Separate the factors and solve for y.,
Try the same process with a harder equation.",How to Find the Equations of the Asymptotes of a Hyperbola1," We'll start with a simple example: a hyperbola with the center of its origin. For these hyperbolas, the standard form of the equation is x2/a2 - y2/b2 = 1 for hyperbolas that extend right and left, or y2/b2 - x2/a2 = 1 for hyperbolas that extend up and down.Remember, x and y are variables, while a and b are constants (ordinary numbers).



Example 1: x2/9 - y2/16 = 1

Some textbooks and teachers switch the position of a and b in these equations.Follow the equation closely so you understand what's going on. If you just memorize the equations you won't be prepared when you see a different notation.;
, This new equation represents both asymptotes, though it will take a little more work to separate them.Example 1: x2/9 - y2/16 = 0


, Factor the left hand side of the equation into two products. Refresh your memory on factoring a quadratic if you need to, or follow along while we continue Example 1:


We'll end up with an equation in the form (__ ± __)(__ ± __) = 0.

The first two terms need to multiply together to make x2/9, so take the square root and write it in those spaces: (x/3 ± __)(x/3 ± __) = 0

Similarly, take the square root of y2/16 and place it in the two remaining spaces: (x/3 ± y/4)(x/3 ± y/4) = 0

Since there are no other terms, write one plus sign and one minus sign so the other terms cancel when multiplied: (x/3 + y/4)(x/3 - y/4) = 0


, To get the equations for the asymptotes, separate the two factors and solve in terms of y.



Example 1: Since (x/3 + y/4)(x/3 - y/4) = 0, we know x/3 + y/4 = 0 and x/3 - y/4 = 0

Rewrite x/3 + y/4 = 0 → y/4 = - x/3 → y = - 4x/3

Rewrite x/3 - y/4 = 0 → - y/4 = - x/3 → y = 4x/3


, We've just found the asymptotes for a hyperbola centered at the origin. A hyperbola centered at (h,k) has an equation in the form (x - h)2/a2 - (y - k)2/b2 = 1, or in the form (y - k)2/b2 - (x - h)2/a2 = 1. You can solve these with exactly the same factoring method described above. Just leave the (x - h) and (y - k) terms intact until the last step.



Example 2: (x - 3)2/4 - (y + 1)2/25 = 1

Set this equal to 0 and factor to get:
((x - 3)/2 + (y + 1)/5)((x - 3)/2 - (y + 1)/5) = 0
Separate each factor and solve to find the equations of the asymptotes:
(x - 3)/2 + (y + 1)/5 = 0 → y = -5/2x + 13/2
((x - 3)/2 - (y + 1)/5) = 0 → y = 5/2x - 17/2

Write down the hyperbola equation with the y2 term on the left side.,
Take the square root of each side.,
Review the definition of an asymptote.,
Adjust the equation for large values of x.,
Solve for y to find the two asymptote equations.",How to Find the Equations of the Asymptotes of a Hyperbola2," This method is useful if you have an equation that's in general quadratic form. Even if it's in standard form for hyperbolas, this approach can give you some insight into the nature of asymptotes. Rearrange the equation so the y2 or (y - k)2 term is on one side to get started.



Example 3: (y + 2)2/16 - (x + 3)2/4 = 1

Add the x term to both sides, then multiply each side by 16:
(y + 2)2 = 16(1 + (x + 3)2/4)
Simplify:
(y + 2)2 = 16 + 4(x + 3)2

, Take the square root, but don't try to simplify the right hand side yet. Remember, when you take the square root, there are two possible solutions: a positive and a negative. (For example, -2 * -2 = 4, so √4 can be equal to -2 as well as 2.) Use the ""+ or -"" sign ± to keep track of both solutions.


√((y + 2)2) = √(16 + 4(x + 3)2)
(y+2) = ± √(16 + 4(x + 3)2)

, It's important that you understand this before you continue to the next step. The asymptote of a hyperbola is a line that the hyperbola gets closer and closer to as x increases. X can never actually reach the asymptote, but if we follow the hyperbola for larger and larger values of x, we'll get closer and closer to the asymptote.

, Since we're trying to find the asymptote equation now, we only care about x for very large values (""approaching infinity""). This lets us ignore certain constants in the equation, because they contribute such a small part relative to the x term. Once x is at 99 billion (for example), adding three is so small we can ignore it.


In the equation (y+2) = ± √(16 + 4(x + 3)2), as x approaches infinity, the 16 becomes irrelevant.

(y+2) = approximately ± √(4(x + 3)2) for large values of x

, Now that we've got rid of the constant, we can simplify the square root. Solve in terms of y to get the answer. Remember to split the ± symbol into two separate equations, one with + and one with -.


y + 2 = ±√(4(x+3)^2)
y + 2 = ±2(x+3)
y + 2 = 2x + 6 and y + 2 = -2x - 6
y = 2x + 4 and y = -2x - 8

We'll assume you only have the vector's definition in terms of its dimensional coordinates (also called components).If you already know a vector's length (its magnitude), you'll be able to skip some of the steps below.

Example: The two-dimensional vector u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} = (2,2). Vector v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}} = (0,3). These can also be written as u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} = 2i + 2j and v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}} = 0i + 3j = 3j.

While our example uses two-dimensional vectors, the instructions below cover vectors with any number of components.
;
, To find the angle θ between two vectors, start with the formula for finding that angle's cosine. You can learn about this formula below, or just write it down:cosθ = (u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} • v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}}) / (||u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}}|| ||v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}}||)


||u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}}|| means ""the length of vector u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}}.""


u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} • v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}} is the dot product (scalar product) of the two vectors, explained below.


, Picture a right triangle drawn from the vector's x-component, its y-component, and the vector itself. The vector forms the hypotenuse of the triangle, so to find its length we use the Pythagorean theorem. As it turns out, this formula is easily extended to vectors with any number of components.||u||2 = u12 + u22. If a vector has more than two components, simply continue adding +u32 + u42 + ...

Therefore, for a two-dimensional vector, ||u|| = √(u12 + u22).

In our example, ||u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}}|| = √(22 + 22) = √(8) = 2√2. ||v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}}|| = √(02 + 32) = √(9) = 3.


, You have probably already learned this method of multiplying vectors, also called the scalar product.To calculate the dot product in terms of the vectors' components, multiply the components in each direction together, then add all the results.For computer graphics programs, see Tips before you continue.

In mathematical terms, u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} • v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}} = u1v1 + u2v2, where u = (u1, u2). If your vector has more than two components, simply continue to add + u3v3 + u4v4...

In our example, u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} • v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}} = u1v1 + u2v2 = (2)(0) + (2)(3) = 0 + 6 = 6. This is the dot product of vector u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} and v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}}.


, Remember, cosθ = (u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} • v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}}) / (||u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}}|| ||v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}} ||). Now you know both the dot product and the lengths of each vector. Enter these into this formula to calculate the cosine of the angle.

In our example, cosθ = 6 / (2√2 * 3) = 1 / √2 = √2 / 2.


, You can use the arccos or cos-1 function on your calculator to find the angle θ from a known cos θ value. For some results, you may be able to work out the angle based on the unit circle.

In our example, cosθ = √2 / 2. Enter ""arccos(√2 / 2)"" in your calculator to get the angle. Alternatively, find the angle θ on the unit circle where cosθ = √2 / 2. This is true for θ = π/4 or 45º.

Putting it all together, the final formula is: angle θ = arccosine((u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}} • v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}}) / (||u→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {u}}}|| ||v→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}} ||))


, This formula was not derived from existing rules. Instead, it was created as a definition of two vectors' dot product and the angle between them.However, this decision was not arbitrary. With a look back to basic geometry, we can see why this formula results in intuitive and useful definitions.

The examples below use two-dimensional vectors because these are the most intuitive to use. Vectors with three or more components have properties defined with the very similar, general case formula.


, Take an ordinary triangle, with angle θ between sides a and b, and opposite side c. The Law of Cosines states that c2 = a2 + b2 -2abcos(θ). This is derived fairly easily from basic geometry.
, Sketch a pair of 2D vectors on paper, vectors a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} and b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}}, with angle θ between them. Draw a third vector between them to make a triangle. In other words, draw vector c→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {c}}} such that b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} + c→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {c}}} = a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}}. This vector c→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {c}}} = a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} - b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}}., Insert the length of our ""vector triangle"" sides into the Law of Cosines:


||(a - b)||2 = ||a||2 + ||b||2 - 2||a|| ||b||cos(θ)


, Remember, a dot product is the magnification of one vector projected onto another. A vector's dot product with itself doesn't require any projection, since there is no difference in direction.This means that a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} = ||a||2. Use this fact to rewrite the equation:

(a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} - b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}}) • (a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} - b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}}) = a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} + b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} • b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} - 2||a|| ||b||cos(θ)


, Expand the left side of the formula, then simplify to reach the formula used to find angles.


a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} - a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} - b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} • a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} + b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} • b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} = a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} + b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} • b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} - 2||a|| ||b||cos(θ)

- a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} - b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} • a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} = -2||a|| ||b||cos(θ)

-2(a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}}) = -2||a|| ||b||cos(θ)


a→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {a}}} • b→{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {b}}} = ||a|| ||b||cos(θ)

Draw the x axis.,
Draw the y axis.,
Calculate the values of y for several values of x.,
Mark the ordered pairs on the graph.,
You have created a graph of the function f(x) = 2x.

",How to Draw a Graph,"


Make a horizontal line on the paper. You may draw arrows on the ends of the line to indicate it is a number line that continues past your data sample.
Put the label ""X"" to the right of the line to indicate the x axis.
Mark the center of the line with a vertical tick mark and label it 0. This is the origin of the graph.
Make equally spaced tick marks on the rest of the x axis. For this example you should label the tick marks from 1 to 10 on the right side of the 0.;
,


Make a vertical line that passes through the origin of the x axis.
Put the label ""Y"" above the line.
Make equally spaced tick marks on the y axis. For this example you should label the tick marks from 2 to 20 above the 0.

,


We will be drawing a graph using the function f(x) = 2x. This means that y = 2x. For every possible value on the x axis there will be a corresponding value on the y axis. To calculate the value of y, plug a number into x. If x= 3 then f(x) = 6. Only positive values will be used in this example.
Set x = 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. The corresponding y values are 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. The result is a set of ordered pairs represented with the x, or abscissa, first and the y, or ordinate, second. For our example we will have five ordered pairs: (0,0), (2,4), (4,8), (6,12), and (8,16).

,


Count over on the x axis then count up on the y axis. The value of y is marked on the the graph above the x value.

Consider weight loss or weight gain.",How to Measure Your Waist to Height Ratio," You need a few things in order to calculate your waist-to-height ratio. Having everything ready will make this process quick.


The first thing you'll need is a tape measure. Get a non-elastic, cloth measuring tape. This is the best choice since it won't stretch when you pull it taut around you body.Find a calculator or use your smartphone or tablet calculator app. Unless you're really good at doing math in your head, you may want to make sure your calculation is correct.
Get a pen and paper. Write down your height and waist measurements to keep track of everything.;
, Use your measuring tape to get a value for your waist. It's essential to get this measurement as accurate as possible for this equation.Start by wrapping the tape measure around your body. Have the end (the one starting with 0) near your belly button in the front.
Pull the measuring tape so it's about 1 inch above your belly button. This will accurately place the tape measure at your waist and not at hip-level.
Try to stand next to a mirror so you can see the tape measure around your body. Try to keep it parallel to the floor and at equal level all the way around your body.
Pull the tape measure so it's snug around your waist, but not digging into your body.
Also, take this measurement as you breathe out, not as you're inhaling. Your waist is naturally at its relaxed state as you exhale. Record this number on your sheet of paper.

, Just like with your waist circumference measurement, you want to make sure that your height is accurate as well. Use your known height or ask someone to measure your height.


If you don't have anyone to measure your height, use the last height that was taken from a doctor's visit. Unless you're a child, your height has probably remained the same since your last doctor's visit.
If you have someone to help take your height, you can get a more updated measurement.
To start, make sure you're not wearing shoes or socks. You don't want to artificially increase your height by having your shoes on. This will not be an accurate reflection of your true height.
Stand with your back and heels pressed up against a wall — make sure you are on a flat, non-carpeted surface. Using a ruler, have your friend or family member press the ruler to the top of your head, so it's completely parallel to the floor. Using a pencil, make a small mark on the wall at your height level.
Using the measuring tape, measure from the floor up to the mark. This is how tall you are.

, After you have both your height and your weight, you can input your measurements into a simple equation to determine your waist-to-height ratio.


The equation to determine this ratio is: waist in inches divided by height in inches.
For example, if your waist is 30"" and your height is 67"", your equation would look like: 30"" / 67"" = .44. This is your waist-to-height ratio.

, If math isn't your strong point or you don't have a calculator on hand, you can also figure out your waist-to-height ratio by using free, online calculators.


There are many websites that offer to do your waist-to-height ratio. However, not all websites are preferred sources and may give you incorrect or unsubstantiated information.
Try to use sources that are unbiased and well-founded. These will not only give you an accurate measurement, but also provide you with accurate information.
Sources you can try include:

Penn State Pro Wellness: http://prowellness.vmhost.psu.edu/prevention/understanding_risk/whtr%7C

Health & Fitness Calculators: http://www.health-calc.com/body-composition/waist-to-height-ratio%7C




, The online calculators are really easy and simple to use. Plus, they allow you to figure out your waist-to-height ratio just in a few clicks.


Measure your waist and height. You will need to measure your waist and height to input this information into the online calculator. Be accurate so the ratio comes out correctly.
Online calculators will also generally require that you input your gender — male or female. This doesn't factor into the actual calculation, but does impact how your results are read.

, Many of the online websites will not only provide you with your waist-to-height ratio, but also provide you with information, advice or suggestions for managing your weight.


After you've put in your information and received your waist-to-height ratio, you may get some information regarding your results. Many sites will provide recommendations based on these results.
Since your waist-to-height ratio reflects your risk for chronic health conditions and provides information regarding your body fat distribution, if your ratio is high, a website may suggest losing weight.
The same goes for a lower waist-to-height ratio. If you have an overly low ratio, a website may advise that you are underweight and should gain weight in order to be healthy.
Although in general, these recommendations may be appropriate, do not gain or lose weight without speaking to your doctor first. Remember, this information is only part of your health picture and should not be used to diagnose or treat any condition.

, After either calculating your waist-to-height ratio by hand or using an online calculator, see how your results measure up. You can use this information to direct you on a path towards better health.


Waist-to-height ratio cannot necessarily tell you that you are overweight or underweight or even give you a specific amount of weight to lose. However, it does give you information about how much excess fat you have around your mid-section.
Increased levels of abdominal fat, especially visceral fat (the kind found in and around your abdominal organs) can be dangerous and increases your risk for diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer., Waist-to-height ratios will differ between men and women. Since men typically have more muscle mass and store excess fat in different locations, interpreting your ratio correctly is essential.


For men, if your waist-to-height ratio is over .53, you're more than likely overweight. If it's over .63, you may even be obese. With ratio levels this high, you may benefit from weight loss.If your waist-to-height ratio is .43 – .52 as a man, you're most likely at a normal weight and do not have increased levels of visceral fat. However, if your ratio is below .43 it may suggest that you're too thin and underweight.

, Although very similar to the guidelines for men, women have more wiggle room when it comes to their waist-to-height ratio.


For women, it's very similar. If your waist-to-height ratio is above .49 you're more than likely overweight and if it's over .58 you could even be obese.
A normal waist-to-height ratio for women is between .42 – .48. If it's less than .42 you may be too thin and considered underweight.

, Your waist-to-height ratio is just one measure of your overall health. Alone, it will not give you a clear picture of whether you're over or underweight or whether or not you would benefit from a change to your weight.


Whenever you're trying to determine whether or not you should lose or gain weight, it's best to find out a variety of weight measurements — not just one. The more measurements you have, the more clear of a picture you'll get.
Consider your ideal body weight. This is done by a calculation that uses your gender and height to find an appropriate weight for you. If your weight is above or below this value, you may benefit from weight gain or loss.BMI is another measure that could indicate whether or not you're overweight. Similar to waist-to-height ratio, BMI shows how much body fat you have in relation to lean mass.The higher the BMI, the more likely it is that you're overweight or obese.
Check your waist-to-hip ratio. This is similar to the waist-to-height ratio and can provide you with similar information about visceral fat. This ratio is determined by the following calculation: waist measurement divided by hip measurement.
Waist circumference is something you should already have from doing your waist-to-height ratio. This is the measurement around your midsection. If your waist circumference is high (over 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men), it suggests that you are carrying a lot of excess weight that could be visceral fat., Now that you have your actual waist-to-height ratio and also have information regarding your current weight, BMI and waist circumference, you can bring this information to a meeting with your doctor.


If you've figured out a variety of weight measures and are noticing that many are indicating that you're overweight or obese, it's a smart idea to bring this information to your doctor.
Being overweight or obese, especially if you're carrying that extra weight around your midsection, increases your risk for a variety of chronic and dangerous health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.If many of the weight measurements are saying you're underweight or too thin, consider talking to your doctor about possible weight gain and if you'd benefit from weighing a little more.
Regardless of what your weight measurements indicate, always talk to your doctor before diagnosing yourself with a certain condition or making any large changes to your weight.

, If you've talked to your doctor and have concluded that your weight should change based on the information you've gathered, consider changing your diet and lifestyle to push your weight in the right direction.


If your BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio all indicate you're overweight and your doctor agrees, consider losing weight.
You'll most likely need to follow a lower calorie diet and increase your exercise to help you get down to a healthier weight.
If your BMI, ideal body weight and waist-to-height ratio indicate that you're a normal or healthy weight, make sure you try to keep your weight stable to help prevent any future issues. Regular weigh-ins can help keep you aware of any small and unwanted weight fluctuations.
If these indicators show that you're underweight and your doctor thinks you'd benefit from weight gain, consider modifying your diet to include a few extra calories to help you slowly increase your weight.

Compare two diagonals.",How to Find the Diagonal of a Square Using Its Area," The formula is Area=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=s^{2}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the square.In order to find the length of the diagonal, you first need to find the side length of the square.

The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length and width, but since a square rectangle has four equal side lengths, you can use this shortened formula for its area.;
, Make sure you put the value on the left side of the equation. Do not substitute for s{\displaystyle s}. If you don’t know the area of the square, you cannot use this method.

For example, you might need to find the diagonal length of a square that has an area of 169 square centimeters. So, your equation will look like this: 169=s2{\displaystyle 169=s^{2}}.


, Taking the square root of both sides will give you the side length of the square. The easiest way to calculate a square root of a number is to use the x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}} function on a calculator. You can also  calculate a square root by hand. Remember that when finding the square root of a squared variable, the answer is simply the variable.

For example:169=s2{\displaystyle 169=s^{2}}169=s2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {169}}={\sqrt {s^{2}}}}13=s{\displaystyle 13=s}So, a square with an area of 169 square centimeters has a side length of 13 cm.


, The formula is Diagonal=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=s{\sqrt {2}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} is the length of one of the square’s sides.This formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem. The diagonal divides a square into two right triangles. So, using the side lengths and the Pythagorean Theorem, you get the formula s2+s2=c2{\displaystyle s^{2}+s^{2}=c^{2}}, which simplifies to s2=c{\displaystyle s{\sqrt {2}}=c}.


, Substitute for the variable s{\displaystyle s}. You should have calculated the side length previously.

For example, if you found that the side length of a square is 13 centimeter (5.1 in), your equation will look like this: Diagonal=132{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=13{\sqrt {2}}}


, The square root of 2 is about 1.414. You can also use a calculator to find a more precise answer. Calculating the side length by 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} gives you the length of the square’s diagonal.

For example:Diagonal=132{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=13{\sqrt {2}}}Diagonal=13(1.414){\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=13(1.414)}Diagonal=18.382{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=18.382}So, the length of the square's diagonal is about 18.38 cm.


, A square has an area of 120 square centimeters. What is the length of its diagonal?

Find the side length of the square by using the formula Area=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=s^{2}}:120=s2{\displaystyle 120=s^{2}}120=s2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {120}}={\sqrt {s^{2}}}}10.95=s{\displaystyle 10.95=s}

Plug the side length into the formula Diagonal=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=s{\sqrt {2}}}:Diagonal=10.952{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=10.95{\sqrt {2}}}Diagonal=10.95(1.414){\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=10.95(1.414)}Diagonal=15.4833{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=15.4833}So, the length of the diagonal is about 15.5 cm.


, The corners are at the northwest and southeast corners of a square field. The field has an area of 16,000 square feet.

The distance between opposite corners of a square is the length of the diagonal. So first find the side length using the area formula:Area=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=s^{2}}16,000=s2{\displaystyle 16,000=s^{2}}16,000=s2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {16,000}}={\sqrt {s^{2}}}}126.49=s{\displaystyle 126.49=s}

Plug the side length into the formula Diagonal=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=s{\sqrt {2}}}:Diagonal=126.492{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=126.49{\sqrt {2}}}Diagonal=126.49(1.414){\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=126.49(1.414)}Diagonal=178.86{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=178.86}So, the length of the diagonal is about 179 feet.


, The diagonal of rhombus is 12 feet (3.7 m). How does its length compare to the diagonal of a square with an area of 72.25 square feet?

Find the square’s side length by using the area formula:Area=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=s^{2}}72.25=s2{\displaystyle 72.25=s^{2}}72.25=s2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {72.25}}={\sqrt {s^{2}}}}8.5=s{\displaystyle 8.5=s}

Plug the side length into the formula Diagonal=s2{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=s{\sqrt {2}}}:Diagonal=8.52{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=8.5{\sqrt {2}}}Diagonal=8.5(1.414){\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=8.5(1.414)}Diagonal=12.02{\displaystyle {\text{Diagonal}}=12.02}So, the length of the square’s diagonal is about 12 feet (4 m). This means that the diagonal of the rhombus is about the same length.

Let's say that we have two 3-dimensional vectors, vector A and vector B. We might write these vectors in components as A = <Ax,Ay,Az > and B = <Bx,By,Bz>, using x y z components accordingly.;
, In other words, add the x component of the first vector to the x component of the second and so on for for y and z. The answers you get from adding the x, y, and z components of your original vectors are the x, y, and z components of your new vector.


In general terms, A+B = <Ax+Bx,Ay+By,Az+Bz>.
Let's add two vectors A and B. Example: A = <5, 9, -10> and B = <17, -3, -2>. A + B = <5+17, 9+-3, -10+-2>, or <22, 6, -12>.

, Note that subtracting one vector from another A-B can be thought of adding the ""reverse"" of that second A+(-B)., A = <18, 5, 3> and B = <10, 9, -10>. A - B = <18-10, 5-9, 3-(-10)>, or <8, -4, 13>.

Write down the polar coordinates.",How to Plot Polar Coordinates," You've probably graphed points with Cartesian coordinates before, using (x,y){\displaystyle (x,y)} notation to mark locations on a rectangular grid. Polar coordinates use a different kind of graph instead, based on circles:The center point of the graph (or ""origin"" in a rectangular grid) is the pole. You can label this with the letter O.

Starting from the pole, draw a horizontal line to the right. This is the polar axis. Label the axis with units as you would the positive x-axis on a rectangular grid.

If you have special polar graph paper, it will include many circles of different sizes, all centered on the pole. You do not have to draw these yourself if using blank paper.
;
, On the polar plane, a point is represented by a coordinate in the form (r,θ){\displaystyle (r,\theta )}:

The first variable, r{\displaystyle r}, stands for radius. The point is located on a circle with radius r{\displaystyle r}, centered on the pole (origin).

The second variable, θ{\displaystyle \theta }, represents an angle. The point is located along a line that passes through the pole and forms an angle θ{\displaystyle \theta } with the polar axis.


, In polar coordinates, the angle is usually measured in radians instead of degrees. In this system, one full rotation (360º or a full circle) covers an angle of 2π{\displaystyle \pi } radians. (This value is chosen because a circle with radius 1 has a circumference of 2π{\displaystyle \pi }.) Familiarizing yourself with the unit circle will make working with polar coordinates much easier.

If your textbook uses degrees, you don't need to worry about this for now. It is possible to plot polar points using degree values for θ{\displaystyle \theta }.


, Any point P{\displaystyle P} has polar coordinates in the form (r,θ){\displaystyle (r,\theta )}. Begin by drawing a circle with radius r{\displaystyle r}, centred on the pole.

The pole is the center point of the graph, where the origin is on the rectangular coordinate plane.

For example, to plot the point (5,π2){\displaystyle (5,{\frac {\pi }{2}})}, place your compass on the pole. Extend the pencil end of the compass to 5 units along the polar axis. Rotate the compass to draw a circle.


, Place a protractor so the center is on the pole, and the edge runs along the polar axis. Measure the angle θ{\displaystyle \theta } from this axis. If the angle is in radians and your protractor only shows degrees, you can convert the units or refer to the unit circle for help.

For the point (5,π2){\displaystyle (5,{\frac {\pi }{2}})}, the unit circle tells you that π2{\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}} is ¼ of the way around the circle, equivalent to 90 degrees from the polar axis.

Always measure positive angles counter-clockwise from the axis. Measure negative angles clockwise from the axis.


, The next step will be to draw a line along the angle you measured. Before you can do this, however, you need to know which way to draw the line. Refer back to the polar coordinates (r,θ){\displaystyle (r,\theta )} to find out:

If r{\displaystyle r} is positive, draw the line ""forward"", from the pole straight through the angle marking you just made.

If r{\displaystyle r} is negative, draw the line ""backward"": from the angle marking back through the pole, to intersect the circle on the opposite side.

Don't be confused by rectangular coordinates: this does not correspond to positive or negative values on an x- or y- axis.


, This is the point (r,θ){\displaystyle (r,\theta )}.

The point (5,π2){\displaystyle (5,{\frac {\pi }{2}})} is located on a circle with radius 5 centered on the pole, ¼ of the way along the circle's circumference in a counter-clockwise direction from the polar axis. (This point is equivalent to (0, 5) in rectangular coordinates.)


, Use the pole as its centre.
, Measure this angle from the polar axis (equivalent to the positive x-axis). Since the angle −π3{\displaystyle {\frac {-\pi }{3}}} is negative, measure this angle in a clockwise direction.
, Start at the pole (origin). Since the radius is positive, move forward from the pole through the angle you measured. The point where the line intersects the circle is (4,−π3){\displaystyle (4,{\frac {-\pi }{3}})}.
, Use the pole as its centre. Although the radius is actually -2, the sign is not important for this step.
, Since the angle 3π2{\displaystyle {\frac {3\pi }{2}}} is positive, you must go counter-clockwise from the polar axis.
, Since the radius −2{\displaystyle -2} is negative, you must go from the pole in the opposite direction of the given angle. The point where the line intersects the circle is (−2,3π2){\displaystyle (-2,{\frac {3\pi }{2}})}.
, Starting at the origin, draw a line segment 2 units along the positive x-axis. Draw a second line segment from that point 1 unit in the positive y direction. You are now at point (2, 1), so label this point P.
, Draw a line between O and P. This line has length r{\displaystyle r} in polar coordinates. It is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so you can find the hypotenuse's length using geometry. For example:

The legs of this right triangle have values of 2 and 1.

With the Pythagorean theorem, calculate that the hypotenuse's length is 22+12=4+1=5≈2.236{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2^{2}+1^{2}}}={\sqrt {4+1}}={\sqrt {5}}\approx 2.236}.

The general formula to find r{\displaystyle r} from Cartesian coordinates is r=x2+y2{\displaystyle r={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}}, where x{\displaystyle x} is the Cartesian x-coordinate and y{\displaystyle y} the Cartesian y-coordinate.


, Use trigonometry to find this value:


tan⁡(θ)=oppositeadjacent=12{\displaystyle \tan(\theta )={\frac {opposite}{adjacent}}={\frac {1}{2}}}tan−1⁡(12)=θ=26.56∘{\displaystyle \tan ^{-1}({\frac {1}{2}})=\theta =26.56^{\circ }}

The general formula to find θ{\displaystyle \theta } is θ=tan−1⁡(yx){\displaystyle \theta =\tan ^{-1}({\frac {y}{x}})}, where y{\displaystyle y} is the Cartesian y-coordinate and x{\displaystyle x} the Cartesian x-coordinate.


, You now have the values of r{\displaystyle r} and θ{\displaystyle \theta }. The rectangular coordinates (2, 1) convert to approximate polar coordinates of (2.24, 26.6º), or exact coordinates of (5,tan−1⁡(12)){\displaystyle ({\sqrt {5}},\tan ^{-1}({\frac {1}{2}}))}.

Draw a large cross in the middle of your graph paper.,
Label each axis with the variable it represents.,
Identify the range of data you have to include for each variable.,
Decide how many units every line on the graph represents for each of your variables.,
Plot your data on the graph.,
Connect the left-most dot and the dot to its right with a straight line.,
Repeat the process if you're graphing multiple data sets.,
Write the graph's title at the top of the page.",How to Make a Line Graph," This represents the two axes y and x -- one vertical, one horizontal. The vertical axis is designated the Y-axis and the horizontal as the X-axis. The place where the lines cross is called the origin.


The areas below the X-axis and to the left of the Y-axis represent negative numbers. If your data set doesn't include negative numbers, you can omit those portions of the graph.;
, To continue the temperature-time example from the introduction, you would label the x-axis as months during the year, and the y-axis as temperature.

, To continue the temperature-time example, you'd select a range that was large enough to include the highest and lowest temperatures you plan to graph. If the range isn't very high, you can have a larger scale, spreading it out more so that it fills up the graph instead of just covering 10% of it.

, You might designate a scale of 10 degrees Fahrenheit (12.22 degrees Celsius) per line to measure temperature along the Y-axis, and a scale of one month per line to measure time along the X-axis.


Label several of the lines along each axis with the scale measurements. You don't need to label every line, but you should space the labeled line at regular intervals along the axis.

, For example: If the high temperature in your hometown was 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 degrees Celsius) in January, locate the ""January"" line on the X-axis and the ""40 degrees"" line on the Y-axis. Trace both lines to the point where they intersect. Place a dot on the intersection. Repeat for all of your other data until you've plotted each point on the graph.

, Continue connecting the dots, one by one, working from left to right. Make sure that it looks like you're connecting the points with straight lines only, so that the graph does not look curved. Once you've connected all of the points, you will have successfully graphed all of the data.

, If you're graphing multiple data sets on the graph, use a distinctive color of pen, or style of line, for the first data set. Place an example of the color/line style off to the side of the graph and label it with the name of the information being displayed. For example: ""High Temperatures.""

Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the next data set, using a different-color pen or a different style of line for each data set.
Place an example of the second line color/style in the margin and label it, too. For example, you could use a red pen to graph high temperatures, then use a blue pen to graph low temperatures over the same period on the same graph. Continue repeating steps 1 and 2 for each remaining data set you want to include on the graph.

, For example: Average Monthly High and Low Temperatures in Seattle, 2009. You should do this last after you know how much space all of the graphs will take up on the page.

Set up the formula for area of a rectangle.,
Plug the values for area and length into the formula.,
Solve for w{\displaystyle w}.,
Write your final answer.",How to Find the Width of a Rectangle1," The formula is A=(l)(w){\displaystyle A=(l)(w)}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the rectangle, l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle, and w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle.This method will only work if you are given the area and length of the rectangle.

You might also see the formula written as A=(h)(w){\displaystyle A=(h)(w)}, where h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the rectangle and is used instead of length.These two terms refer to the same measurement.
;
, Make sure you substitute for the correct variables.

For example, if you are trying to find the width of a rectangle that has an area of 24 square centimeters, and a length of 8 centimeters, your formula will look like this:24=8w{\displaystyle 24=8w}


, To do this, you need to divide each side of the equation by the length.

For example, in the equation 24=8w{\displaystyle 24=8w}, you would divide each side by 8.24=8w{\displaystyle 24=8w}248=8w8{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{8}}={\frac {8w}{8}}}3=w{\displaystyle 3=w}


, Don’t forget to include the unit of measurement.

For example, for a rectangle with an area of 24cm2{\displaystyle 24cm^{2}} and a length of 8cm{\displaystyle 8cm}, the width would be 3cm{\displaystyle 3cm}.

Represent vectors visually by drawing them with a head and tail.,
To add 2 vectors, draw the second vector B so that its tail meets the head of the first A.,

Note that the order you join the vectors in is not important.,
To subtract, add the ""negative"" of the vector.,
If adding or subtracting more than two vectors, join all other vectors head-to-tail in sequence.,
To get the result: Draw a new vector from tail of the first vector to the head of the last.,
Represent your resultant vector via its magnitude and direction.",How to Add or Subtract Vectors2," Since vectors have magnitude and direction, they are likened to arrows with a tail and a head and a length. Vectors can be said to have a ""beginning point"" and an ""end point"". The ""sharp point"" of the arrow is the vector's head and the ""base"" of the arrow is the tail.


When making a scale drawing of a vector, you must take care to measure and draw all angles accurately. Mis-drawn angles will lead to poor answers.

, This is referred to as joining your vectors ""head to tail"". If you are only adding two vectors, this is all you'll need to do before finding your resultant vector A+B. Vector B may need to be slid into position without altering its orientation , called parallel transport., Vector A + Vector B = Vector B + Vector A

, Subtracting vectors visually is fairly simple. Simply reverse the vector's direction but keep its magnitude the same and add it to your vector head to tail as you would normally. In other words, to subtract a vector, turn the vector 180o around and add it.

, Actually the order in which you join the vectors does not matter. This method can be used for any number of vectors.

, Whether you are adding/subtracting two vectors or a hundred, the vector stretching from the original starting point (the tail of your first vector) to end point of your final added vector (the head of your last vector) is the resultant vector, or the sum of all your vectors. Note that this vector is identical to the vector obtained by adding the x,y, and perhaps z components of all the vectors separately.


If you drew all of your vectors to scale, measuring all angles exactly, you can find the magnitude of the resultant vector by measuring its length. You can also measure the angle that the resultant makes with either a specified vector or the horizontal/vertical etc. to find its direction.
If you didn't draw all vectors to scale, you probably need to calculate the magnitude of the resultant using trigonometry. You may find the Sine Rule and the Cosine Rule helpful here. If you are adding more than two vectors together, it is helpful to first add two, then add their resultant with the third vector, and so on. See the following section for more information.

, Vectors are defined by their length and direction. As noted above, assuming you drew your vectors accurately, your new vector's magnitude is its length and its direction is its angle relative to the vertical, horizontal, etc. Use the units of your added or subtracted vectors to choose the units for your resultant vector's magnitude.


For example, if the vectors we added represented velocities in ms-1, we might define our resultant vector as ""a velocity of x ms-1 at yo to the horizontal"".

Use trigonometry to find a vector's components.,
Add or subtract two or more vectors' corresponding components.,
Calculate the magnitude of the resultant vector using the Pythagorean Theorem.,
Calculate the direction of the resultant with the tangent function.,
Represent your resultant vector via its magnitude and direction.",How to Add or Subtract Vectors3," To find a vector's components, it's usually necessary to know its magnitude and its direction relative to the horizontal or vertical and to have a working knowledge of trigonometry. Taking a 2-D vector first: set or imagine your vector as the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose other two sides are parallel to the x and y axes. These two sides can be thought of as head-to-tail component vectors that add to create your original vector.


The lengths of the two sides are equal to the magnitudes of the x and y components of your vector and may be calculated using trigonometry. If x is the magnitude of the vector, the side adjacent to the vector's angle (relative to the horizontal, vertical, etc.) angle is xcos(θ), while the side opposite is xsin(θ).
It's also important to note the direction of your components. If the component points in the negative direction of one of your axes, it is given a negative sign. For example, in a 2-D plane, if a component points to the left or downwards, it is given a negative sign.
For example, let's say that we have a vector with a magnitude of 3 and a direction of 135o relative to the horizontal. With this information, we can determine that its x component is 3cos(135) = -2.12 and its y component is 3sin(135) = 2.12


, When you've found the components of all of your vectors, simply add their magnitudes together to find the components of your resultant vector. First, add all the magnitudes of the horizontal components (those parallel to the x-axis) together. Separately, add all the magnitudes of the vertical components (those parallel to the y-axis). If a component has a negative sign (-), its magnitude is subtracted, rather than added. The answers you obtain are the components of your resultant vector.


For instance, let's say that our vector from the previous step, <-2.12, 2.12>, is being added to the vector <5.78, -9>. In this case, our resultant vector would be <-2.12+5.78, 2.12-9>, or <3.66, -6.88>.

, The Pythagorean Theorem, c2=a2+b2, solves for the side lengths of right triangles. Since the triangle formed by our resultant vector and its components is a right triangle, we can use it to find our vector's length and therefore its magnitude. With c as the magnitude of the resultant vector, which you're solving for, set a as the magnitude of its x component and b as the magnitude of its y components. Solve with algebra.


To find the magnitude of the vector whose components we found in the previous step, <3.66, -6.88>, let's use the Pythagorean Theorem. Solve as follows:

c2=(3.66)2+(-6.88)2

c2=13.40+47.33
c=√60.73 = 7.79




, Finally, find the resultant vector's direction. Use the formula θ=tan-1(b/a), where θ is the angle that the resultant makes with the x-axis or the horizontal, b is the magnitude of the y component, and a is the magnitude of the x component.


To find the direction of our example vector, let's use θ=tan-1(b/a).

θ=tan-1(-6.88/3.66)
θ=tan-1(-1.88)
θ=-61.99o




, As noted above, vectors are defined by their magnitude and direction. Be sure to use the proper units for your vector's magnitude.


For example, if our example vector represented a force (in Newtons), then we might write it as ""a force of 7.79 N at -61.99o to the horizontal"".

Set up the formula for perimeter of a rectangle.,
Plug the values for perimeter and length into the formula.,
Solve for w{\displaystyle w}.,
Write your final answer.",How to Find the Width of a Rectangle2," The formula is P=2l+2w{\displaystyle P=2l+2w}, where P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter of the rectangle, l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle, and w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle.This method will only work if you are given the perimeter and length of the rectangle.

You might also see the formula written as P=2(w+h){\displaystyle P=2(w+h)}, where h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the rectangle and is used instead of length.The variables l{\displaystyle l} and h{\displaystyle h} refer to the same measurement, and the distributive property dictates that these two formulas, although arranged differently, will give you the same result.


, Make sure you substitute for the correct variables.

For example, if you are trying to find the width of a rectangle that has a perimeter of 22 centimeters, and a length of 8 centimeters, your formula will look like this:22=2(8)+2w{\displaystyle 22=2(8)+2w}22=16+2w{\displaystyle 22=16+2w}


, To do this, you need to subtract the length from each side of the equation, then divide by 2.

For example, in the equation 22=16+2w{\displaystyle 22=16+2w}, you would subtract 16 from each side, then divide by 2.22=16+2w{\displaystyle 22=16+2w}6=2w{\displaystyle 6=2w}62=2w2{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{2}}={\frac {2w}{2}}}3=w{\displaystyle 3=w}


, Don’t forget to include the unit of measurement.

You might also see the formula written as D=w2+h2{\displaystyle D={\sqrt {w^{2}+h^{2}}}}, where h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the rectangle and is used instead of length.The variables l{\displaystyle l} and h{\displaystyle h} refer to the same measurement.


, Make sure you substitute for the correct variables.

For example, if you are trying to find the width of a rectangle that has a diagonal length of 5 centimeters, and a side length of 4 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 5=w2+42{\displaystyle 5={\sqrt {w^{2}+4^{2}}}}


, You need to do this to get rid of the square root sign, which makes isolating the width variable easier.

For example:5=w2+42{\displaystyle 5={\sqrt {w^{2}+4^{2}}}}52=w2+42{\displaystyle 5^{2}=w^{2}+4^{2}}25=w2+16{\displaystyle 25=w^{2}+16}


, To do this, you need to subtract the squared length from each side of the equation.

For example, in the equation 25=16+w2{\displaystyle 25=16+w^{2}}, you would subtract 16 from each side.25=16+w2{\displaystyle 25=16+w^{2}}9=w2{\displaystyle 9=w^{2}}


, To do this, you need to find the square root of each side of the equation.

For example:9=w2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9}}={\sqrt {w^{2}}}}3=w{\displaystyle 3=w}


, Don’t forget to include the unit of measurement.

For example, for a rectangle with a diagonal length of 5cm{\displaystyle 5cm} and a side length of 4cm{\displaystyle 4cm}, the width would be 3cm{\displaystyle 3cm}.

Write the expression that describes the relationship between the length and the width.,
Replace the l{\displaystyle l} variable in your area (or perimeter) formula with the expression for length.,
Simplify the equation.,
Solve for w{\displaystyle w}.",How to Find the Width of a Rectangle4," Which formula you use will depend on which measurement you are given. If you are given the area, set up the area formula. If you are given the perimeter, set up the perimeter formula.

If you do not know the area or the perimeter, or the relationship between the length and the width, you cannot use this method.

The formula for area is A=(l)(w){\displaystyle A=(l)(w)}.

The formula for perimeter is P=2l+2w{\displaystyle P=2l+2w}.

For example, you might know that the area of a rectangle is 24 square centimeters, so you would set up the formula for area of a rectangle.


, Write your expression in terms of what l{\displaystyle l} equals.

The relationship might be given by stating how many times bigger one side is than the other, or how many units more or less it is.

For example, you might know that the length is five centimeters longer than the width. Your expression for the length is then l=w+5{\displaystyle l=w+5}.


, Your formula should now only contain the variable w{\displaystyle w}, which means you can solve for the width.

For example, if you know that area is 24 square centimeters, and that l=w+5{\displaystyle l=w+5}, your formula will look like this:A=(l)(w){\displaystyle A=(l)(w)}24=(w+5)(w){\displaystyle 24=(w+5)(w)}


, Your simplified equation might take on various forms, depending on the relationship between the length and the width, and depending on whether you are working with area or perimeter.Think about setting up an equation that allows you to solve for w{\displaystyle w} in the simplest way.

For example, you can simplify 24=(w+5)(w){\displaystyle 24=(w+5)(w)} to 0=w2+5w−24{\displaystyle 0=w^{2}+5w-24}.


, Again, how you solve for w{\displaystyle w} will depend on your simplified equation. Use the basic rules of algebra and geometry to solve.

You might need to use addition or division to solve, or you might need to factor a quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to solve.For example, 0=w2+5w−24{\displaystyle 0=w^{2}+5w-24} can be factored as follows:0=w2+5w−24{\displaystyle 0=w^{2}+5w-24}0=(w+8)(w−3){\displaystyle 0=(w+8)(w-3)}You will then have two possible solutions for w{\displaystyle w}:  w=3{\displaystyle w=3} or w=−8{\displaystyle w=-8}. Since a rectangle cannot have a negative width, you can eliminate -8. So your solution is w=3{\displaystyle w=3}."

The units for circumference can be any unit for the measure of length: feet, miles, meters, centimeters, etc.;
, There are three components to finding circumference of a circle: radius, diameter, and π. The radius and diameter are related: the radius is equal to half the diameter, while the diameter is equal to double the radius.


The radius (r) of a circle is the distance from one point on the circle to the center of the circle.
The diameter (d) of a circle is the distance from one point on the circle to another directly opposite it, going through the circle’s center.The Greek letter pi (π) represents the ratio of the circumference divided by the diameter and is represented by the number 3.14159265…, an irrational number that has neither a final digit nor a recognizable pattern of repeating digits.This number is commonly rounded to 3.14 for basic calculations.

, Using a ruler, place one end at one side of the circle and place it through the center point to the other side of the circle. The distance to the center of the circle is the radius, while the distance to the other end of the circle is the diameter.


In most textbook math problems, the radius or diameter is given to you.

, Once you have determined the radius and/or diameter of the circle, you can plug these variables into the appropriate equation. If you have the radius, use C = 2πr, but if you have the diameter, use C = πd.


For example: What is the circumference of a circle with a radius of 3 cm?

Write the formula: C = 2πr
Plug in the variables: C = 2π3
Multiply through: C = (2*3*π) = 6π = 18.84 cm


For example: What is the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 9 m?

Write the formula: C = πd
Plug in the variables: C = 9π
Multiply through: C = (9*π) = 28.26 m



, Now that you’ve learned the formula, it’s time to practice with a few examples. The more problems you solve, the easier it becomes to solve them in the future.


Find the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 5 ft.

C = πd = 5π = 15.7 ft


Find the circumference of a circle with a radius of 10 ft.

C = 2πr = C = 2π10 = 2 * 10 * π = 62.8 ft.



, The area of a circle can be calculated using the diameter or the radius with two different formulas: A = πr2 or A = π(d/2)2,where π is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14,r is equal to the radius, and d is the diameter.


Because the radius of a circle is equal to twice its diameter, these equations are essentially the same.
The units for area can be any unit for the measure of length squared: feet squared (ft2), meters squared (m2), centimeters squared (cm2), etc.

, Using a ruler, place one end at one side of the circle and place it through the center point to the other side of the circle. The distance to the center of the circle is the radius, while the distance to the other end of the circle is the diameter.


In most textbook math problems, the radius or diameter is given to you.

, Once you have determined the radius and/or diameter of the circle, you can plug these variables into the appropriate equation. If you have the radius, use A = πr2, but if you have the diameter, use A = π(d/2)2.


For example: What is the area of a circle with a radius of 3 m?

Write the formula: A = πr2

Plug in the variables: A = π32

Square the radius: r2 = 32 = 9
Multiply by pi: A = 9π = 28.26 m2



For example: What is the area of a circle with a diameter of 4 m?

Write the formula: A = π(d/2)2

Plug in the variables: A = π(4/2)2

Divide the diameter by 2: d/2 = 4/2 = 2
Square the result: 22 = 4
Multiply by pi: A = 4π = 12.56 m2




, Now that you’ve learned the formula, it’s time to practice with a few examples. The more problems you solve, the easier it becomes to solve them in the future.


Find the area of a circle with a diameter of 7 ft.

A = π(d/2)2 = π(7/2)2 = π(3.5)2 = 12.25 * π= 38.47 ft2.


Find the area of a circle with a radius of 3 ft.

A = πr2 = π32 = 9 * π = 28.26 ft2




, Some problems may give you a radius or diameter that has a variable in it: r = (x + 7) or d = (x + 3). In this case, you can still solve for the area or circumference, but your final answer will also have that variable in it. Write down the radius or diameter as it is stated in the problem.


For example: Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of (x = 1).

, Whether you are solving for area or circumference, you will still follow the basic steps of plugging in what you know. Write down the formula for area or circumference and then write in the variables given.


For example: Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of (x + 1).
Write the formula: C = 2πr
Plug in the given information: C = 2π(x+1)

, At this point, you can just solve the problem as you normally would, treating the variable as if it were just another number. You may need to use the distributive property to simplify the final answer.


For example: Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of (x = 1).
C = 2πr = 2π(x+1) = 2πx + 2π1 = 2πx +2π = 6.28x + 6.28
If you are given the value of “x” later in the problem, you can plug it in and get a whole number answer.

, Now that you’ve learned the formula, it’s time to practice with a few examples. The more problems you solve, the easier it becomes to solve them in the future.


Find the area of a circle with a radius of 2x.

A = πr2 = π(2x)2 = π4x2 = 12.56x2



Find the area of a circle with a diameter of (x + 2).

A = π(d/2)2 = π((x +2)/2)2 = ((x +2)2/4)π

Understand factors that can influence the density of a water.",How to Find the Density of Water," To calculate the density of water you will need a graduated cylinder, a scale or balance, and water. Graduated cylinders are special containers that have lines or gradations that allow you to measure a specific volume of liquid.;
, In order to find the density, you have to know the mass and volume of the liquid in question. You will use the graduated cylinder to obtain the mass of the water, but you have to subtract out the weight of the graduated cylinder so you know you’re only measuring the mass of the water itself.


Turn the balance on and make sure it is set to zero.
Place the dry, empty graduated cylinder on the balance.
Record the mass of the cylinder in grams (g).
For example, let’s say the empty graduated cylinder weighs 11 grams.

, It doesn’t matter how much water you add, but be sure to note the exact amount. Read the volume by looking at the cylinder at eye level and recording the volume at the bottom of the meniscus. The meniscus is the curve of the liquid that you’ll see when you look at the water right at eye level.The volume of water in the graduated cylinder is the volume you will use for the density calculation.
Let’s say you filled the graduated cylinder with 7.3 milliliters (mL) of volume.

, Make sure the balance is set to zero and weigh the graduated cylinder full of water. Be careful not to spill any of the water out of the top when you weigh it.


If you do spill the water, take note of the new volume and re-weigh the water-filled graduated cylinder.
For example, let’s say the full graduated cylinder weighs 18.3 grams.

, To get the mass of the water only, you must subtract out the weight of the graduated cylinder. The result is the mass of the water in the cylinder.


In our example, the mass of the graduated cylinder is 11 g and the mass of the cylinder full of water is 18.3 g. 18.3 g – 11 g = 7.3 g, therefore the mass of the water is 7.3 grams.

, Using the equation density = mass/volume, you can determine the density of water.Plug in the values of mass and volume you determined and solve.


Mass of the water: 7.3 g
Volume of the water: 7.3 mL
Density of water = 7.3/7.3 = 1 g/mL

, Density is equal to the mass of an object, m, divided by the volume, v, of that object. Density is represented with the Greek letter rho, ρ. An object that is denser will have a greater mass for a smaller amount of volume compared to an object that is less dense.


The standard equation for density is ρ = m/v.

, When calculating density, it is customary to use metric units. The mass of an object is represented in grams. The volume of the object is in milliliters. You may also see volume in centimeters cubed (cm3).

, The density of an object can be used to identify different materials.If you are trying to identify a substance, you can calculate its density and then compare it to the known density of other materials.

, Although the density of water is pretty close to 1 g/mL, certain disciplines of science need to know the density of water with a higher specificity. The density of pure water is altered by temperature.Water density increases as the temperature gets colder.


For example, at 0°C the density of water is .9998 g/mL, but at 80°C the density is .9718 g/mL. These differences may seem small, but are very important to be aware of in scientific experiments and research.

If you think about it, the can has a top and a bottom that are the same. Both of these ends are the shape of a circle. The first step to finding the surface area of your cylinder will be to find the surface area of these circular ends., The radius is the distance from the center of a circle to the outer edge of the circle. Radius is abbreviated “r.” The radius of your cylinder is the same as the radius of the top and bottom circles. In this example, the radius of the base is 3 centimeter (1.2 in).If you are solving a word problem, the radius may be given. The diameter also might be given, which is the distance from one side of the circle to the other, passing through the center point. The radius is exactly one half the diameter.
You can measure the radius with a ruler if you are looking for the surface area of an actual cylinder.

, The surface area of a circle is equal to the number pi (~3.14) times the radius of the circle squared. The equation is written as π x r2. This is the same as saying π x r x r.


To find the area of the base, just plug the radius, 3 centimeter (1.2 in), into the equation for finding the area of a circle: A = πr2. Here's how you do it:A = πr2

A = π x 32

A = π x 9 = 28.26 cm2


, Now that you have solved for the area of one base, you have to take into account the area of the second base. You can follow the same steps as you did with the first base, or you can recognize that the bases are identical. You can skip using the area equation a second time for the second base if you understand this., When you visualize a cylindrical soup can, you should see a top and a bottom base. The bases are connected to each other by a “wall” of can. The radius of the wall is the same as the radius of the base, but unlike the base, the wall has height., You will need to find the circumference to find the surface area of the outer edge (also known as lateral surface area). To get the circumference, simply multiply the radius by 2π. So, the circumference can be found by multiplying 3 centimeter (1.2 in) by 2π. 3 centimeter (1.2 in) x 2π = 18.84 centimeter (7.4 in)., This will give you the outer edge surface area. Multiply the circumference, 18.84 centimeter (7.4 in), by the height, 5 centimeter (2.0 in). 18.84 centimeter (7.4 in) x 5 centimeter (2.0 in) = 94.2 cm2., First, you visualized how the top and bottom base and solved for the area contained on those surfaces. Next, you thought about the wall that extends between those bases and solved for that space. This time, think of the can as a whole, and you are solving for the entire surface., Simply multiply the previous result, 28.26 cm2, by 2 to get the area of both bases. 28.26 x 2 = 56.52 cm2. This gives you the area of both bases., Once you add the area of the two bases and the outer surface area, you will have found the surface area of the cylinder. All you have to do is add 56.52 cm2, the area of both bases, and the outer surface area, 94.2 cm2. 56.52 cm2 + 94.2 cm2 = 150.72 cm2. The surface area with a cylinder with a height of 5 centimeter (2.0 in) and a circular base with a radius of 3 centimeter (1.2 in) is 150.72 cm2."

Calculate the perimeter.,

Plug the values of a and p in the formula and get the area.,
Understand that a regular polygon can be thought of as a collection of triangles.,
Remember the formula for the area of a triangle.,
See the similarities.",How to Find the Area of Regular Polygons," The perimeter is the combined length of the outline of any two-dimensional figure. For a regular polygon, it can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by the number of sides (n)., The apothem of a regular polygon is the shortest distance from the center point to one of the sides, creating a right angle. This is a little trickier to calculate than the perimeter.


The formula for calculating the length of the apothem is this: the length of the side (s) divided by 2 times the tangent (tan) of 180 degrees divided by the number of sides (n).

, The area of any regular polygon is given by the formula:Area = (a x p)/2,
where a is the length of the apothem and p is the perimeter of the polygon.

, As an example, let's use a hexagon (6 sides) with a side (s) length of 10.


The perimeter is 6 x 10 (n x s), equal to 60 (so p = 60).
The apothem is calculated by its own formula, by plugging in 6 and 10 for n and s. The result of 2tan(180/6) is 1.1547, and then 10 divided by 1.1547 is equal to 8.66.
The area of the polygon is Area = a x p / 2, or 8.66 multiplied by 60 divided by 2. The solution is an area of 259.8 units.
Note as well, there are no parenthesis in the ""Area"" equation, so 8.66 divided by 2 multiplied by 60, will give you the same result, just as 60 divided by 2 multiplied by 8.66 will give you the same result.

, Each side represents the base of a triangle, and there are as many triangles in the polygon as there are sides. Each of the triangles are equal in base length, height, and area., The area of any triangle is 1/2 times the length of the base (which, in the polygon, is the length of a side) multiplied by the height (which is the same as the apothem in regular polygon)., Again, the formula for a regular polygon is 1/2 times the apothem multiplied by the perimeter. The perimeter is just the length of one side multiplied the by the number of sides (n); for a regular polygon, n also represents the number of triangles that make up the figure. The formula, then, is nothing more than the area of a triangle multiplied by the number of triangles in the polygon."

Set up the Pythagorean Theorem.,
Solve for h. Remember, the area formula uses b and h, but you don't know the value of h yet.,
Plug in the values for your triangle to find h. Now that you know this formula, you can use it for any isosceles triangle where you know the sides.,
Plug the base and height into your area formula.,
Try a more difficult example.",How to Find the Area of an Isosceles Triangle1," Squares and rectangles are parallelograms, as is any four-sided shape with two sets of parallel sides. All parallelograms have a simple area formula: area equals base multiplied by the height, or A = bh.If you place the parallelogram flat on a horizontal surface, the base is the length of the side it is standing on. The height (as you would expect) is how high it is off the ground: the distance from the base to the opposite side. Always measure the height at a right (90 degree) angle to the base.

In squares and rectangles, the height is equal to the length of a vertical side, since these sides are at a right angle to the ground.
;
, There's a simple relationship between these two shapes. Cut any parallelogram in half along the diagonal, and it splits into two equal triangles. Similarly, if you have two identical triangles, you can always tape them together to make a parallelogram. This means that the area of any triangle can be written as A = ½bh, exactly half the size of a corresponding parallelogram.
, Now you have the formula, but what exactly do ""base"" and ""height"" mean in an isosceles triangle? The base is the easy part: just use the third, unequal side of the isosceles.

For example, if your isosceles triangle has sides of 5 centimeters, 5 cm, and 6 cm, use 6 cm as the base.

If your triangle has three equal sides (equilateral), you can pick any one to be the base. An equilateral triangle is a special type of isosceles, but you can find its area the same way., Make sure the line hits the base at a right angle. The length of this line is the height of your triangle, so label it h. Once you calculate the value of h, you'll be able to find the area.

In an isosceles triangle, this line will always hit the base at its exact midpoint.


, Notice that the height line divided your isosceles triangle into two identical right triangles. Look at one of them and identify the three sides:

One of the short sides is equal to half the base: b2{\displaystyle {\frac {b}{2}}}.

The other short side is the height, h.

The hypotenuse of the right triangle is one of the two equal sides of the isosceles. Let's call it s.


, Any time you know two sides of a right triangle and want to find the third, you can use the Pythagorean theorem: (side 1)2 + (side 2)2 = (hypotenuse)2 Substitute the variables we're using for this problem to get (b2)2+h2=s2{\displaystyle ({\frac {b}{2}})^{2}+h^{2}=s^{2}}.

You probably learned the Pythagorean Theorem as a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}. Writing it as ""sides"" and ""hypotenuse"" prevents confusion with your triangle's variables.


, Rearrange the formula to solve for h:


(b2)2+h2=s2{\displaystyle ({\frac {b}{2}})^{2}+h^{2}=s^{2}}h2=s2−(b2)2{\displaystyle h^{2}=s^{2}-({\frac {b}{2}})^{2}}h=(s2−(b2)2){\displaystyle h={\sqrt {(}}s^{2}-({\frac {b}{2}})^{2})}.


, Just plug in the length of the base for b and the length of one of the equal sides for s, then calculate the value of h.

For example, you have an isosceles triangle with sides 5 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm. b = 6 and s = 5.

Substitute these into your formula:h=(s2−(b2)2){\displaystyle h={\sqrt {(}}s^{2}-({\frac {b}{2}})^{2})}h=(52−(62)2){\displaystyle h={\sqrt {(}}5^{2}-({\frac {6}{2}})^{2})}h=(25−32){\displaystyle h={\sqrt {(}}25-3^{2})}h=(25−9){\displaystyle h={\sqrt {(}}25-9)}h=(16){\displaystyle h={\sqrt {(}}16)}h=4{\displaystyle h=4} cm.


, Now you have what you need to use the formula from the start of this section: Area = ½bh. Just plug the values you found for b and h into this formula and calculate the answer. Remember to write your answer in terms of square units.

To continue the example, the 5-5-6 triangle had a base of 6 cm and a height of 4 cm.

A = ½bhA = ½(6cm)(4cm)A = 12cm2.


, Most isosceles triangles are more difficult to work with than the last example. The height often contains a square root that doesn't simplify to an integer. If this happens, leave the height as a square root in simplest form. Here's an example:

What is the area of a triangle with sides 8 cm, 8 cm, and 4 cm?

Let the unequal side, 4 cm, be the base b.

The height h=82−(42)2{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {8^{2}-({\frac {4}{2}})^{2}}}}=64−4{\displaystyle ={\sqrt {64-4}}}=60{\displaystyle ={\sqrt {60}}}

Simplify the square root by finding factors: h=60=4∗15=415=215.{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {60}}={\sqrt {4*15}}={\sqrt {4}}{\sqrt {15}}=2{\sqrt {15}}.}

Area =12bh{\displaystyle ={\frac {1}{2}}bh}=12(4)(215){\displaystyle ={\frac {1}{2}}(4)(2{\sqrt {15}})}=415{\displaystyle =4{\sqrt {15}}}

Leave this answer as written, or enter it in a calculator to find a decimal estimate (about 15.49 square centimeters).

"
Start with a side and an angle.,
Divide the isosceles into two right triangles.,
Use trigonometry to find the value of h. Now that you have a right triangle, you can use the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent.,
Find the value of the remaining side.,
Relate x to the base of the isosceles triangle.,
Plug your values for h and b into the basic area formula.,
Turn this into a universal formula.",How to Find the Area of an Isosceles Triangle2," If you know some trigonometry, you can find the area of an isosceles triangle even if you don't know the length of one of its side. Here's an example problem where you only know the following:The length s of the two equal sides is 10 cm.

The angle θ between the two equal sides is 120 degrees.


, Draw a line down from the vertex between the two equal sides, that hits the base at a right angle. You now have two equal right triangles.

This line divides θ perfectly in half. Each right triangle has an angle of ½θ, or in this case (½)(120) = 60 degrees.


, In the example problem, you know the hypotenuse, and you want to find the value of h, the side adjacent to the known angle. Use the fact that cosine = adjacent / hypotenuse to solve for h:

cos(θ/2) = h / s

cos(60º) = h / 10

h = 10cos(60º)


, There is one remaining unknown side of the right triangle, which you can call x. Solve for this using the definition sine = opposite / hypotenuse:

sin(θ/2) = x / s

sin(60º) = x / 10

x = 10sin(60º)


, You can now ""zoom out"" to the main isosceles triangle. Its total base b is equal to 2x, since it was divided into two segments each with a length of x.
, Now that you know the base and height, you can rely on the standard formula A = ½bh:


A=12bh{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}bh}=12(2x)(10cos60){\displaystyle ={\frac {1}{2}}(2x)(10cos60)}=(10sin60)(10cos60){\displaystyle =(10sin60)(10cos60)}=100sin(60)cos(60){\displaystyle =100sin(60)cos(60)}

You can enter this into a calculator (set to degrees), which gives you an answer of about 43.3 square centimeters. Alternatively, use properties of trigonometry to simplify it to A = 50sin(120º).


, Now that you know how this is solved, you can rely on the general formula without going through the full process every time. Here's what you end up with if you repeat this process without using any specific values (and simplifying using properties of trigonometry):A=12s2sinθ{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}s^{2}sin\theta }

s is the length of one of the two equal sides.

θ is the angle between the two equal sides.

Example: Consider the steps you'll need to follow when constructing a rectangular prism with a length of 6 inches (15 cm), a width of 4 inches (10 cm), and a height of 3 inches (7.6 cm).;
, On a sheet of heavy construction paper, use a ruler and pencil to draw two rectangles. The length of each rectangle should match the length of the final prism, and the width of the two rectangles should match the width of the final prism.After drawing both rectangles, use the ruler to measure them again. Both rectangles must be equal in size and must accurately match the length and width of the rectangular prism you wish to create.
Once you are certain that both rectangles are the correct length and width, cut them out with sharp scissors.
Note that these two rectangles will form the top and bottom of your rectangular prism.

Example: Measure and cut two rectangles, each with a length of 6 inches (15 cm) and a width of 4 inches (10 cm).

, Use a ruler and pencil to draw two more rectangles from heavy construction paper. The length of these rectangles should match the length of the rectangular prism, but the width of these rectangles will need to match the height of the final rectangular prism.


Re-measure the two rectangles after drawing them to check for accuracy, then use sharp scissors to cut both of them out.
These two rectangles will eventually form the front and back of your rectangular prism.

Example: Measure and cut two rectangles, each with a length of 6 inches (15 cm) and a width of 3 inches (7.6 cm).

, Sketch two more rectangles on heavy construction paper using a ruler and pencil. The length of each rectangle should match the width of the rectangular prism, and the width of each rectangle should match the height of your rectangular prism.


After drawing both rectangles, measure them again to check for accuracy before cutting them both out with scissors.
These two final rectangles will form the left and right sides of the rectangular prism.

Example: Measure and cut two rectangles, each with a length of 4 inches (10 cm) and a width of 3 inches (7.6 cm).

, Line up the length-by-width rectangles and the length-by-height rectangles, alternating back and forth between the two types. Tape the length sides together on one side of the paper.The paper rectangles should be lined up in the following order: length-by-width, length-by-height, length-by-width, length-by-height. Do not place identical rectangles next to one another.
Note that the rectangles should be lined up so that their length sides lie directly next to the length side of the adjacent rectangle.
Apply one to two strips of tape to each shared edge. When finished, all four rectangles should be taped together into one strip.

Example: Alternate the 6-inch by 4-inch (15-cm by 10-cm) rectangles with the 6-inch by 3-inch (15-cm by 7.6-cm) rectangles, matching the 6-inch (15-cm) sides together. Tape the 6-inch (15-cm) sides in place.

, Fold the strip so that the two unattached length-side ends meet. Use one or two pieces of tape to hold these two ends together.


As you fold, make sure that the strip is folding at the edges between separate rectangular faces. You may need to use your thumbnail to crease the tape in between these edges, making it easier to fold.
When done, you should have something that looks like a rectangular tube. The prism shape is almost complete, but two sides are still missing at this point.

Example: Fold up the strip and tape together the two loose 6-inch (15-cm) sides.

, Position the two remaining rectangles over the two open ends of the shape. Use tape to attach all four sides of each rectangle to the matching sides of the rectangular prism.


Make sure that the height side of each rectangle matches the height side of the prism. Likewise, the width side of each rectangle must match the width side of the prism.
Start by taping one side of each rectangle in place, then tape the opposite side. The paper should already stay in place at that point, but taping the remaining two sides will provide greater security.

Example: Position the 4-inch (10-cm) sides of one rectangle against the 4-inch (10-cm) sides of the rectangular prism. The 3-inch (7.6-cm) sides should naturally match up, as well. Tape the rectangle in place, then repeat with the remaining rectangle.

, Use a ruler to measure all sides of the finished shape. The length, width, and height dimensions should each match the required dimensions you needed to fulfill.


At this point, the rectangular prism is complete.

Example: The final rectangular prism should have a length of 6 inches (15 cm), a width of 4 inches (10 cm), and a height of 3 inches (7.6 cm).

Review the required dimensions.,
Gather enough blocks.,
Create a line of blocks to match the length.,
Create a second line to match the width.,
Complete the rectangle.,
Stack enough blocks to match the height.,
Repeat over the entire rectangle.,
Count the blocks to measure the sides.",How to Make a Rectangular Prism2," You'll need to know the required length, width, and height of the desired rectangular prism before you can build it. Review these dimensions now and refer to them throughout the construction process.For the sake of simplicity, it might be easiest to work in generic “cubic units” instead of inches or other specific measurements. If you do wish to work in specific inches, you will need to use blocks that measure 1-inch (2.5-cm) on all sides. Square dice measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) on all sides can be a good option.

Example: Consider the steps you'll need to follow to construct a rectangular prism with a length of 4 cubic units, a width of 3 cubic units, and a height of 2 cubic units.

, The number of blocks you'll need will match the volume of the final rectangular prism. To find the volume of the rectangular prism, you will need to multiply the length, width, and height together.


Note that you must use cubic blocks with equal lengths, widths, and heights. Do not use blocks of any other shape.
If desired, you can apply a small strip of double-sided tape or another temporary adhesive to all faces of all blocks. Doing so is not strictly necessary but may make it easier to build the final rectangular prism.

Example: To calculate the volume of this rectangular prism, multiply: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24

This signifies that you will need 24 blocks to build this particular rectangular prism.



, Line up enough blocks to match the number of cubic units required for the length of the rectangular prism. Keep the line as even as possible.



Example: Line up four blocks in an even row.

, Starting from the end of your length line, build a second line of blocks that matches the number of cubic units required for the width of your rectangular prism.


The total number of blocks in this width edge must match the width of the final prism. This will include the first block already included in the length line. In other words, the number of blocks you will add to the structure during this step will be one fewer than the number of cubic units making up the width of the rectangular prism.

Example: Line up two more blocks off one corner of your original line, creating a new perpendicular line containing three blocks total.

, Construct another length and width edge to mirror and match the first two. Fill in the rectangular outline with as many blocks as needed to make the rectangle solid.


Count to make sure that the length and width edges match the required length and width of the rectangular prism.
You should also count the total number of blocks used for this first rectangular surface. The total number of blocks should match the surface area of the face, which can be calculated by multiplying the length by the width.

Example: Build another four-block length edge off the end of the first width edge, then build another three-block width edge between the other end of the two length edges. Fill in the space between with two more blocks.

Calculate the surface area by multiplying: 4 * 3 = 12
Count the total number of blocks in this rectangle. There should be 12 blocks total.



, Starting at one corner of the completed rectangular base, stack enough blocks to equal the required height in cubic units for the desired rectangular prism.As you count the number of blocks in this stack, make sure that you count the bottom block already included in the completed base. The total number of blocks in this stack must equal the total number of cubic units in the height of the prism, so the number of blocks you'll add will actually be one fewer than the number of cubic units required for the height of the prism.

Example: Place one block on top of one corner block of your existing rectangle. This should set a height of two blocks (cubic units).

, Build similar stacks of blocks on top of each block in the completed rectangular base. The number of blocks in each of these stacks must match the number of blocks in your first stack and the required height of the rectangular prism.


When finished, you should not have any excess blocks left behind.

Example: Place one block on top of each of the remaining 11 blocks in your original rectangle. This should use up the remainder of your original 24 blocks.

, Measure the sides by counting the number of blocks making up the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism. The blocks making up these sides must match the number of required cubic units for each side of the intended prism.


Note that you can also use these block counts to calculate the surface area of each visible face. To calculate surface area, you simply need to multiply the length and width of any face.
The volume of the rectangular prism can be calculated, as well, by multiplying the number of blocks making up the length, width, and height of the prism. The volume of the rectangular prism in cubic units should match the number of blocks used to construct the prism.

Example: The length of the rectangular prism should contain four blocks, the width should contain three blocks, and the height should contain two blocks.

To calculate the surface area of the front and back faces, multiply: 4 * 2 = 8 units
To calculate the surface area of the top and bottom faces, multiply: 4 * 3 = 12 units
To calculate the surface area of the right and left faces, multiply: 3 * 2 = 6 units
To calculate the total volume of the rectangular prism, multiply: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 cubic units

Determine the object's mass.,
Determine the object's volume.,
Divide the object's mass by its volume.",How to Find Density," An object's mass, simply put, is how much stuff it contains. You can find the mass by weighing the object with a balance or spring scale.


If the object is to be held in a container while being weighed, such as a liquid or powder in a graduated cylinder, the container must first be weighed empty so that its mass can be determined and subtracted from that of the object inside the container.;
, An object's volume is how much space it takes up. Volume can be determined in one of several ways, depending on the object:


If the object is solid with regular dimensions, measure its length, width and height (or length and diameter if cylindrical) and calculate its volume mathematically depending the shape of the object. There are different formula for finding the volume of a rectangle, a cylinder, a pyramid, and so on.
If the object is solid and non-porous with no regular dimensions, such as a jagged rock, you can determine its volume by immersing it in water and measuring the volume of water it displaces. (Under Archimedes' principle, an object displaces a volume of liquid equal to its own volume.)
If the object is a liquid or powder, place it in a graduated cylinder and read the mark to which the substance fills the container. (If the substance is a liquid, read the mark at the lowest point of the curve the top of the liquid forms.)

, This value is the object's density and expresses it in units of mass per unit of volume. For example, for a 20-gram mass that takes up a volume of 5 cubic centimeters, the density is 4 grams per cubic centimeter.

Practice with an example.,
Understand surface area.",How to Find the Surface Area of a Sphere," This nearly ancient formula is still the easiest way to determine the surface area of a sphere. Using almost any calculator, you can plug in the radius to get the surface area of your sphere.



r, or ""radius: The radius is the distance from the center of the sphere to the edge of that sphere.

π, or ""pi:"" This incredible number (equalling roughly 3.14) represents the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter, and is useful in all equations with circles and spheres. It is commonly shortened as π = 3.1416, but there are an infinite number of decimals.4: For somewhat complex reasons, the surface area of a sphere is always 4 times as large as the area of a circle with the same radius.;
, Sometimes your problem will supply you the radius, and other times you will have to find it yourself. If you are given the diameter of a circle, simply divide the diameter by 2 to get the radius. For example, a sphere of diameter 10 inches has a radius of 5 inches.



Advanced Tip:If you only know the volume of a sphere, you need to do a little more work to get the radius. Divide the volume by 4π, then multiply that answer by 3. Finally, take the cube root of this answer.

, You can either do this by manually multiplying (52 = 5 * 5 = 25) or by using your calculator's ""square"" function (sometimes labeled as ""x2"").

, While you can multiply either 4 or pi first, it is generally easier to start with 4 since there are no decimals to multiply yet.


If our radius is 5, like above, you would be left with 4 * 25 * π, or 100π.

, If your problem says ""exact value"", write the symbol π after your number and call it done. Otherwise, use the approximation π=3.14 or your calculator's π button.


100 * π = 100 * 3.14
100π = 314

, Is your sphere's surface area 314 inches big, or 314 miles big? The units need to be written as ""units2,"" because this denotes area, otherwise known as ""square units""


The full answer to the sphere in the pictures is: Surface Area = 314 units2.
The units you use are always the same ones used to measure the radius. If the radius is in meters, the answer will be in meters.

Advanced Tip: We square the units because area measures how many flat squares we could fit on the surface of the sphere. Say we measure the practice problem in inches. This means on a sphere where r=5, we could fit 314 squares on the surface of the sphere if the sides of every square are 1 inch long.

, If the radius of a sphere is 7 centimeters, what is the surface area of that sphere?


4πr2

r = 7
4 * π * 72

49 * 4 * π
196π

Answer: Surface Area = 615.75 centimeters2, or 615.75 square centimeters.

, The surface area of a sphere is the area covering the outside of the sphere -- think of it as the rubber covering a kickball or the surface of the earth. Because it is curved, it is much harder to measure the surface area of a sphere than a box, so we need an equation to determine the area.


Rotating a circle around it's axis (the center point) will produce a sphere. Think of spinning a coin on the table and how it appears to form a sphere. While it won't be explained here, this is where our equation comes from.

Advanced Tip: Spheres have a smaller surface area per volume than any other shape -- that means it can hold more things in a smaller area than any other shape.

Understand that the surface area of a cube is made up of the areas of its six faces.,
Find the area of one side of the cube.,
Multiply the area of the side of the cube by 6.",How to Find the Surface Area of a Cube1," Since all of the faces of a cube are congruent, we can just find the area of one face and multiply it by 6 to get the total surface area. The surface area can be found by using a simple formula: 6 x s2, where ""s"" represents a side of the cube., To find the are of one side of the cube, you need to find ""s,"" which represents the side length of a cube, and then find s2. This really means that you'll be multiplying the length of the cube's side times its width to find its area -- the length and width of a cube's side just happen to be the same. If one side of the cube, or ""s,"" is equal to 4 centimeter (1.6 in), then the area of the side of the cube is (4 cm)2, or 16 cm2. Remember to state your answer in square units.

, Now that you've found the area of one side of the cube, all you have to do to find the surface area is to multiply this number by 6. 16 cm2 x 6 = 96 cm2. The surface area of the cube is 96 cm2.

Find the cube root of the volume.,
Plug this answer into the formula for finding the surface area of a cube.,
Solve.",How to Find the Surface Area of a Cube2," Let's say that the volume of the cube is 125 cm3.

, To find the cube root of the volume, just look for a number that can be cubed to become the volume, or use your calculator. The number won't always be a whole number. In this case, with the number 125 is a perfect cube, and its cube root is 5, because 5 x 5 x 5 = 125. So, ""s,"" or one side of the cube, is 5.

, Now that you know the length of one side of a cube, just plug it into the formula for finding the surface area of a cube: 6 x s2. Since the length of one side is 5 centimeter (2.0 in), just plug it into the formula like this: 6 x (5 cm)2.

, Just do the math. 6 x (5 cm)2 = 6 x 25 cm2 = 150 centimeter (59.1 in) 2.

Calculate the lateral surface area of the cone ((π)(r)(s){\displaystyle (\pi )(r)(s)}).,
Calculate the area of the cone’s base ((π)(r2){\displaystyle (\pi )(r^{2})}).,
Add the lateral surface area and the base area of the cone.",How to Find the Surface Area of Cones1," The formula is SA=(π)(r)(s)+(π)(r2){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(\pi )(r)(s)+(\pi )(r^{2})}, where SA{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}} equals the surface area of the cone, r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the radius of the cone’s base, and s{\displaystyle s} equals the slant height of the cone.The total surface area of a cone is equal to the sum of the lateral surface area ((π)(r)(s){\displaystyle (\pi )(r)(s)}) and the base area ((π)(r2){\displaystyle (\pi )(r^{2})}), since the base of a cone is a circle.

The slant height is the diagonal distance from the top vertex of the cone to the edge of the base.Make sure you don’t confuse the “slant height” with the “height,” which is the perpendicular distance between the top vertex to the base.;
, This length should be given, or you should be able to measure it. Make sure you substitute for both r{\displaystyle r} variables in the formula.

For example, if the radius of the base of a cone is 5 cm, your formula will look like this: SA=(π)(5)(s)+(π)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(\pi )(5)(s)+(\pi )(5^{2})}.


, This length should be given, or you should be able to measure it.

For example, if the slant height of a cone is 10 cm, your formula will look like this: SA=(π)(5)(10)+(π)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(\pi )(5)(10)+(\pi )(5^{2})}.


, To do this, multiply the radius, slant height, and π{\displaystyle \pi }. If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 as the value of π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example:SA=(π)(5)(10)+(π)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(\pi )(5)(10)+(\pi )(5^{2})}SA=(3.14)(5)(10)+(π)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(3.14)(5)(10)+(\pi )(5^{2})}SA=157+(π)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=157+(\pi )(5^{2})}


, To do this, square the radius of the base, then multiply by π{\displaystyle \pi }. If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 as the value of π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example:SA=157+(π)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=157+(\pi )(5^{2})}SA=157+(3.14)(25){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=157+(3.14)(25)}SA=157+78.5{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=157+78.5}


, This will give you the total surface area of the cone, in square units.

For example:SA=157+78.5=235.5{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=157+78.5=235.5}So, the surface area of a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 10 cm is 235.5 square centimeters.

Substitute the radius for the variable a{\displaystyle a} and the height for the variable b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the radius of a cone is 5 cm and the height is 12 cm, your formula will look like this: 52+122=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+12^{2}=c^{2}}.


, Remember that squaring a number means to multiply it by itself.

For example:52+122=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+12^{2}=c^{2}}25+144=c2{\displaystyle 25+144=c^{2}}169=c2{\displaystyle 169=c^{2}}


, This will give you the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, which is equal to the the slant height of the cone.For example:169=c2{\displaystyle 169=c^{2}}169=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {169}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}13=c{\displaystyle 13=c}So, the slant height of the cone is 13 cm.


, The formula is SA=(π)(r)(s)+(π)(r2){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(\pi )(r)(s)+(\pi )(r^{2})}, where SA{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}} equals the surface area of the cone, r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the radius of the cone’s base, and s{\displaystyle s} equals the slant height of the cone.The total surface area of a cone is equal to the sum of the lateral surface area ((π)(r)(s){\displaystyle (\pi )(r)(s)}) and the base area ((π)(r2){\displaystyle (\pi )(r^{2})}, since the base of a cone is a circle).


, The radius should be given, and you already calculated the slant height. Make sure you use the slant height in the surface area formula, not the (perpendicular) height. If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }

For example, for a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 13 cm, your formula will look like this: SA=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(5^{2})}.


, Then, add these products together. The sum will give you the total surface area of the cone in square units.

For example:SA=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(5^{2})}SA=204.1+(3.14)(25){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=204.1+(3.14)(25)}SA=204.1+78.5{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=204.1+78.5}SA=282.6{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=282.6}So, the surface area of a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm is 282.6 square centimeters.

If not, you cannot use this method. If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }.

For example, if you know a cone has a volume of 950 cubic centimeters and a radius of 6 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 950=13(3.14)(62)(h){\displaystyle 950={\frac {1}{3}}(3.14)(6^{2})(h)}.


, First, square the radius, then multiply that value by π{\displaystyle \pi }. Then, multiply that product by 13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3}}}. This will give you the coefficient for the h{\displaystyle h} variable.

For example:950=13(3.14)(62)(h){\displaystyle 950={\frac {1}{3}}(3.14)(6^{2})(h)}950=13(3.14)(36)(h){\displaystyle 950={\frac {1}{3}}(3.14)(36)(h)}950=13(113.04)(h){\displaystyle 950={\frac {1}{3}}(113.04)(h)}950=37.68h{\displaystyle 950=37.68h}


, This will give you the value of h{\displaystyle h}, which is the perpendicular height of the cone. You will need this information to find the slant height of the cone, which is necessary to know when solving for the surface area.

For example:950=37.68h{\displaystyle 950=37.68h}95037.68=37.68h37.68{\displaystyle {\frac {950}{37.68}}={\frac {37.68h}{37.68}}}25.21=h{\displaystyle 25.21=h}So, the height of the cone is 25.21 cm.

Substitute the radius for the variable a{\displaystyle a} and the height for the variable b{\displaystyle b}

For example, if the radius of a cone is 6 cm and the height is 25.21 cm, your formula will look like this: 62+25.212=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+25.21^{2}=c^{2}}.


, This will give you the length of the right triangle’s hypotenuse, which is also the slant height of the cone.

For example:62+25.212=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+25.21^{2}=c^{2}}36+635.54=c2{\displaystyle 36+635.54=c^{2}}671.54=c2{\displaystyle 671.54=c^{2}}671.54=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {671.54}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}25.91=c{\displaystyle 25.91=c}So, the slant height of the cone is 25.91 cm.


, The formula is SA=(π)(r)(s)+(π)(r2){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(\pi )(r)(s)+(\pi )(r^{2})}, where SA{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}} equals the surface area of the cone, r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the radius of the cone’s base, and s{\displaystyle s} equals the slant height of the cone.The total surface area of a cone is equal to the sum of the lateral surface area ((π)(r)(s){\displaystyle (\pi )(r)(s)}) and the base area ((π)(r2){\displaystyle (\pi )(r^{2})}, since the base of a cone is a circle).


, Make sure you use the slant height in the surface area formula, not the (perpendicular) height. If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }

For example, for a cone with a radius of 6 cm and a slant height of 25.91 cm, your formula will look like this: SA=(3.14)(6)(25.91)+(3.14)(62){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(3.14)(6)(25.91)+(3.14)(6^{2})}.


, Then, add these products together. The sum will give you the total surface area of the cone in square units.

For example:SA=(3.14)(6)(25.91)+(3.14)(62){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(3.14)(6)(25.91)+(3.14)(6^{2})}SA=488.14+(3.14)(36){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=488.14+(3.14)(36)}SA=488.14+113.04{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=488.14+113.04}SA=601.18{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=601.18}So, the surface area of a cone with a radius of 6 centimeters and a volume of 950 cubic centimeters is 601.18 square centimeters.

, Multiply the number you get when you divide by 360 by the number you got earlier after you multiply by pi. For us, this gives a result of about 102.214.

, This resulting number is the area of your sector, making our sector 102.214 square inches.

Get your measurements.,
Multiply the two radii.,
Multiply that number by pi.,
Get your result.",How to Find the Area of a Shape5," To get the area of an ellipse, you'll need to know the two ""radio"", which you can think of as the width and the height each divided in half. These are the measurements from the center to the middle of the long side and from the center to the middle of the short side. The measurement lines should form a right angle.


In the real world, you'll have to measure for yourself but for your homework your teacher should have these measurements listed with the shape.

, For us, let's say that the ellipse is 6 inches wide and 4 inches tall. This gives us radii of 3 inches and 2 inches. Now, we'll multiply those numbers by each other, giving us 6 (3x2).

, Pi (π) is a really big number that is used in lots of calculations. If you're using a calculator, use the pi function for a really accurate result. If not, you can round pi (ignore some of the numbers) and just multiply by 3.14159. That gives us a value of 18.84954.

Use alternative methods.",How to Find the Area of a Shape7," You'll have to start finding the area for complex shapes by breaking the shape down into geometric shapes, like those discussed above. On homework assignments, it will probably be pretty clear cut what those shapes should be, but in the real world, you might need to break an area up into a lot of shapes in order to get really accurate.


A good place to start is by looking for right angles and parallel lines. These serve as the basis of many shapes.

, Use the instructions above to find the area of the different shapes you find.

, Add the resulting areas together in order to get the total area for your shape.

, There are other tricks you can try too, depending on the shape. You can also try adding imaginary space in order to make the shape a standard geometric shape, and then subtracting the area of that imaginary space after you get your result, for example.

Ensure that you didn't measure the same side twice.,
Input your measurements into the formula to solve the equation.,
Express your answer in ""units squared"" when done.,
Break complex boxes into smaller pieces to find surface area.",How to Find the Surface Area of a Box1," Surface area is the total area of each side. As long as you know how to find the area of a regular rectangle, which is simply the length times the height, you can find each side and add them together. However, there is also a simplified formula that will do this for you if you know the measurements of the box: SurfaceArea=2lw+2lh+2wh{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2lw+2lh+2wh}



l is the length of the box, or the longest side.


h is the height of the box.


w is the width of the box.
;
, This is your longest side. There should be 4 identical lines equally long across the whole box. Lay the box down on it's longest side to make it easier to measure.


Example: The length of the box is 5 feet.


, Make sure you don't measure the same side as the length.


Example: The height of the box is 4 feet.


, This is the side directly perpendicular (it forms a right angle, or L) with the length. Make sure you are not remeasuring the height.


Example: The width of the box is 2 feet.


, The easiest way to prevent this is to check that all three lines meet at some point. Find a corner and measure the three sides coming off of it -- this ensures you have the right measurements.

The sides may be the same measurement. You just want to make sure you're measuring three unique sides, even if two or three of them are all identical. 


, Once you've got the numbers, the rest is easy. Simply input the measurements and add it all up.


SurfaceArea=2lw+2lh+2wh{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2lw+2lh+2wh}


SurfaceArea=2(5)(2)+2(5)(4)+2(2)(4){\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2(5)(2)+2(5)(4)+2(2)(4)}


SurfaceArea=20+40+16{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=20+40+16}


SurfaceArea=76{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=76}


, This lets people know how you measured everything, and is a crucial part of your answer. Luckily, all you need to do is use the units provided in the question. For this example, since the units were in feet, you would put ""feet squared"" at the end of your answer:

You have a box 5 feet long, 4 feet high, and 2 feet wide, what is the total surface area?

Answer: 76feet2{\displaystyle 76feet^{2}}


, For example, say you had an ""L"" shaped box. Instead of finding everything by hand, simply think of two separate boxes, the vertical half on top and the horizontal half on the bottom. Find the surface area of both, then add them together to get the total surface area.For example, if you have a U shaped box:

Say the bottom has a surface area of 12 units squared.

Say both sides have a surface area of 15 units squared.

The total area would be 42 units squared, since 12+15+15=42{\displaystyle 12+15+15=42}.

The proper formula is SurfaceArea=2B+hC{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2B+hC}  For example, if the area of the base is 3, the height is 5, an the circumference is 6, what is the surface area? Answer = 36 units squared.


B is the area of the base.


h is the height of the cylinder.


C is the circumference of the base., The base is the circular end of the cylinder. It can be found with the formula Area=pi∗r2{\displaystyle Area=pi*r^{2}} R is the radius of the circle. Pi is the constant, rounded to 3.14 for simple problems. You can also leave it as ""pi"" if you do not have a calculator.


Example: The radius of the base in a cylinder is 2. What is the area of the base?


pi∗(2)2{\displaystyle pi*(2)^{2}}

B = 4pi{\displaystyle 4pi}


, The circumference is the distance around the edge of the circle. It is found with the formula Circumference=2∗r∗pi{\displaystyle Circumference=2*r*pi} Continuing the previous example:


2∗pi∗(2){\displaystyle 2*pi*(2)}

C = 4pi{\displaystyle 4pi}


, The height of a cylinder is just another way to figure out how long it is. It is the straight line between the center of the two bases.


Example: In the same cylinder, with radius 2 inches, the height is 5 inches.


h=5{\displaystyle h=5}


, Once you've got your base area, circumference, and height, all you need to do is plug the numbers into your formula to get the right answer.


SurfaceArea=2B+hC{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2B+hC}


SurfaceArea=2(4pi)+(5)(4pi){\displaystyle SurfaceArea=2(4pi)+(5)(4pi)}


SurfaceArea=8pi+20pi{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=8pi+20pi}


SurfaceArea=28pi{\displaystyle SurfaceArea=28pi}


, All problems of surface area need units to give them scale. Is the area in inches, or feet, for example. The units always match the units given to you in the problem. If no units are given, you should just write the phrase ""units squared,"" or ""units2{\displaystyle units^{2}}""

In the example, the units were given as inches. So the final answer would be 28pi{\displaystyle 28pi} inches2{\displaystyle inches^{2}}"

Choose a meter stick or metric tape measure.,
Measure the length of the area you're measuring.,
If you can't measure the entire length at once, do it in stages.,
Measure the width.,
Convert from centimeters to meters.,
Multiply the length and width together.,
Round to a more convenient measurement.",How to Calculate Square Meters1," Select a meter stick ruler or tape measure with meters (m) or centimeters (cm) printed on it. These tools will make it easier to calculate square meters, since they were designed in the same system of measurement.


If you can only find a ruler with feet (ft) or inches (in), measure with those instead, then go to the section on converting to square meters.;
, Square meters are a unit for measuring area, or the size of a two-dimensional object such as a floor or a field. Use your measuring tool to measure one side of the object, from one corner to the other. Write down the result.


If the object is longer than 1 meter, remember to include both the meter and centimeter parts of the measurement. For instance, ""2 meters 35 centimeters.""
If you want to measure an object that isn't rectangular or square, read the Complex Shapes section instead.

, Lay out the measuring tool, then put down a rock or other small object exactly at an easy to remember mark (like 1 meter or 25 centimeters). Pick up the tool and lay it down again, starting at the small object. Repeat until the entire length is covered, and add all your measurements together.

, Use the same tool to measure the width of the same area or object. The side you measure in this step should be angled close to 90º away from the length of the object you measured earlier, like two sides of a square next to each other. Write this number down as well.


Unless the object you're measuring is much smaller than 1 meter, you can round to the nearest centimeter when making your measurements. For instance, if the width is slightly past the 1 meter 8 centimeter mark, just use '""1m 8cm"" as your measurement, without using decimals or millimeter measurements.

, Usually, the measurements won't divide evenly into meters. Instead, you'll have a measurement in both meters and centimeters, for example ""2 meters 35 centimeters."" Because 1 centimeter = 0.01 meters, you can convert a centimeter measurement into meters by moving the decimal point two digits to the left. Here are a couple examples:


35cm = 0.35m, so 2m 35cm = 2m + 0.35m = 2.35m

8cm = 0.08m, so 1m 8cm = 1.08m


, Once both measurements are converted into meters, multiply them together to get the measurement of the area in square meters. Use a calculator if necessary. For example:


2.35m x 1.08m = 2.538 square meters (m2).

, If you get a long decimal as an answer, for instance 2.538 square meters, you'll probably want to round it to a number with fewer digits, for instance 2.54 square meters. In fact, since you probably didn't measure correctly down to the tiniest fraction of a meter, the last digits probably aren't accurate anyway. In most cases, you can round to the nearest centimeter (0.01m). For a more accurate measurement, learn how to round to the significant digits.


Whenever you multiply two numbers with the same units (for instance, meters), the answer is always in the form of that unit squared (m2, or square meters).

Multiply square feet by 0.093.,
Multiply square yards by 0.84.,
Multiply acres by 4050.,
Convert square miles to square kilometers instead.,
Convert square meters to units of area, not length.",How to Calculate Square Meters2," Measure the length and width in feet and multiply them together to get a result in square feet. Since 1 square foot = 0.093 square meters, multiply your result by 0.093 to get the answer in square meters instead. Square meters are bigger than square feet, so it will take fewer of them to cover the same area.


For greater precision, multiply by 0.092903 instead.

, If you have the measurement in square yards, multiply by 0.84 to get the measurement in square meters.


For greater precision, multiply by 0.83613 instead.

, One acre contains about 4050 square meters. If you want to be more precise, multiply by 4046.9 instead.

, One square mile is much, much larger than a square meter, so typically it is converted into square kilometers instead. Multiply the square miles by 2.6 to find the area in square kilometers instead. (Or multiply by 2.59 instead to be more precise.)


If you really want to convert to square meters, 1 square kilometer = 1,000,000 square meters.

, Square meters are a unit that measures area, or two-dimensional surfaces. It doesn't make any sense to compare them with units that measure length, or distance in one direction. You can convert between ""square meters"" and ""square feet,"" but not between ""square meters"" and ""feet.""


Don't use the calculations in this section to convert between units of length. That requires different numbers.

Calculate the area of a circle.",How to Calculate Square Meters3," If you are solving a math problem, draw or cut lines in the shape to divide it into simpler shapes, such as rectangles and triangles. If you are measuring a room or other physical object, sketch a diagram of the area first, then do the same thing. Take measurements of each section and write them on the diagram. Follow the instructions below to find the area of each section, then add the results together.

, To find the area in square meters for rectangular sections, see the instructions for calculating an area in square meters.


If you are measuring in a different unit, look at the section on other units.

, A right triangle, which has a 90º angle just like the corners of a square, has an area easy to calculate. Measure the two sides next to that 90º corner (the length and width), multiply them together, then divide by two to get the answer in square meters.


This works because a right triangle is exactly the size of a rectangle cut in half. Basically, you found the area of a rectangle as usual, then divided by two to get the area of the triangle.

, Draw a line from any corner of a triangle to the opposite side, so that the line hits the opposite side at a 90º angle (picture the corner of a square).You've just divided the triangle into two pieces, each one a right triangle! See above for instructions on how to find the area of a right triangle; measure each of the two sub-triangles separately, and add them together.

, The area of a circle is πr2, where r is the radius, or distance from the center of the circle to the rim, or perimeter. Measure this distance, multiply it by itself, then multiply the result by π on a calculator. If you don't have a calculator with a π function, use 3.14 instead (or 3.1416 if high precision is required).


If you're not sure where the center is, have a friend hold a tape measure and walk around the edge of the circle. Hold the other end of the tape measure and adjust your position until the measurement stays the same while your friend walks around the entire edge.
More complicated curved boundaries require more advanced math to calculate. If you are measuring a room for practical purposes, it might be easier to estimate the area by pretending the curved surfaces are a series of straight lines.

, The base and height are simply the measurements of two perpendicular sides of the square or rectangle; for a square, this two measurements are the same. Simply multiply both numbers together to find the area of the end.

, The radius is the length from the center of the circle to the outside edge. Square this number (i.e. multiply it by itself) and then multiply the result by pi (3.14159…). This gives you the area of the end.

If you’ve been given the diameter (i.e. the length across the entire circle), divide this number in half to find the radius.






If you’ve been given the circumference (i.e. the length of the outside edge of the circle), divide this number by pi and divide that result by 2 to find the radius.







, Parallelograms are slanted squares (like open-ended boxes that have been pushed to one side); they have two pairs of parallel sides but none of the corners are right angles. The base of a parallelogram is simply the length of one of the two long, misaligned sides; the height, however, is the distance between these two sides, not the length of one of the angled sides. If this height isn’t already given to you, the problem will ask you to solve for it by turning on of the angled sides into a right triangle and giving you the length of two of the sides of the triangle. To solve for height this way:


Use the Pythagorean Theorem, which is A^2 + B^2 = C^2. The hypotenuse of the triangle, or C, is simply the side of the triangle opposite the right angle. We’ll call the other side that’s been given B. To solve for the height, which we’ll call A, rearrange the formula to A^2 = C^2 – B^2. Multiply C by itself, then multiply B by itself. Subtract the second result from the first to get A^2; to then solve for A, find the square root of this sum. This is the height of the parallelogram, which you can now multiply by the base to find the total area.

If the matching ends are triangles, solve for all sides by using the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem is A^2 + B^2 = C^2: A and B are the base and height of a right triangle and C is the hypotenuse, which is simply the side opposite the right angle.


If you have been given A and B, use the formula C^2 = A^2 + B^2. Multiply A by itself, multiply B by itself, and add the two numbers together; this gives you C^2. To then solve for C, simply find the square root of this sum.







If you have been given C and B: use the formula A^2 = C^2 – B^2. Multiply C by itself, multiply B by itself, and subtract the second result from the first; this gives you A^2. To then solve for A, simply find the square root of this sum.







If you have been given C and A: use the formula B^2 = C^2 – A^2. Multiply C by itself, multiply A by itself, and subtract the second result from the first; this gives you B^2. To then solve for B, simply find the square root of this sum.









If the matching ends are circles, find the circumference. The formula for circumference is C = D x pi: C is circumference and D is diameter. If you have the radius, simply multiply this by 2 to find the diameter.







If the matching ends are another polygon, break the shape down into triangles and/or squares as before and find the outside edges by solving for these shapes individually. Use the shape guides above if necessary.

Note the length of the prism.,
Find the area of each side.",How to Find the Surface Area of Prisms4," This is the distance between the two matching ends of the prism. Since the ends of the prism are parallel, this distance will be uniform throughout – even if the matching ends are both angled. This means that if you know the length of one side, you know the length of all the sides.

, Each side will either be a square/rectangle or a parallelogram. Parallelograms are slanted squares (like open-ended boxes that have been pushed to one side); they have two pairs of parallel sides but none of the corners are right angles.


To find the area of a square/rectangle, multiply base by height. The base and height are simply the measurements of two perpendicular sides of the square or rectangle; for a square, this two measurements are the same. Simply multiply both numbers together to find the area of the end.







To find the area of a parallelogram, multiply base by height. Note that the base of a parallelogram is simply the length of one of the two long, misaligned sides; the height, however, is the distance between these two sides, not the length of one of the angled sides. If you only know the length of the angled side but not the parallelogram’s true height, draw a line through either side of the parallelogram, turning it into a perfect square/rectangle with a triangle on either end. To find the height using this triangle:






Use the Pythagorean Theorem, which is A^2 + B^2 = C^2. The hypotenuse of the triangle, or C, is simply the side of the triangle opposite the right angle. We’ll call the other side that’s been given B. To solve for the height, which we’ll call A, rearrange the formula to A^2 = C^2 – B^2. Multiply C by itself, then multiply B by itself. Subtract the second result from the first to get A^2; to then solve for A, find the square root of this sum. This is the height of the parallelogram, which you can now multiply by the base to find the total area.



If the prism is cylindrical, find the area of the sides by multiplying circumference, which you solved for in the previous section, by the total height.

Define the formula for surface area of a cube.,
Measure the length of one side.,
Square your measurement for a.,
Multiply this product by six.",How to Find Surface Area1," A cube has six identical square sides. Because both the length and width of a square are equal, the area of a square is a2, where a is the length of a side. Since there are 6 identical sides of a cube, to find the surface area, simply multiply the area of one side times 6. The formula for surface area (SA) of a cube is SA = 6a2, where a is the length of one side.The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.;
, Each side or edge of a cube should, by definition, be equal in length to the others, so you only need to measure one side. Using a ruler, measure the length of the side. Pay attention to the units you are using.


Mark this measurement down as a.
Example: a = 2 cm


, Square the measurement taken for the length of the edge. To square a measurement means to multiply it by itself. When you are first learning these formulas, it might be helpful to write it as SA= 6*a*a.


Note that this step calculates the area of one side of the cube.
Example: a = 2 cm

a2 = 2 x 2 = 4 cm2

, Remember, a cube has six identical sides. Now that you have the area of one side, you need to multiply it by six to account for all six sides.


This step completes the calculation for the cube's surface area.
Example: a2 = 4 cm2

Surface Area = 6 x a2 = 6 x 4 = 24 cm2

Obtain all necessary measurements in yards.,
Use the equation L × W × H for rectangular spaces.,
For cylindrical spaces, use the equation pi × R2 × H. Finding the volume of a cylindrical space is simply a matter of multiplying the two-dimensional area of one of its circular faces by the height or length of the cylinder.,
For spheres, use the equation 4/3 pi × R3.,
For cones, use the equation 1/3 pi × R2 × H. The volume of a given cone is 1/3 the volume of a cylinder that has the same height and radius as the cone.,
For irregular shapes, try using multiple equations.",How to Determine Cubic Yards1," Cubic yard volumes can be obtained relatively easily for a variety of standard three-dimensional spaces via a few simple equations. However, these equations assume that all measurements have been taken in yards. Thus, before using one of these equations, it's important to ensure that you took your initial measurement(s) in yards or, alternatively, that you converted them into yards via a conversion factor. A few conversions for common measurements of length are below:


1 yard = 3 feet
1 yard = 36 inches
1 yard = 0.914 meters
1 yard = 91.44 centimeters;
, The volume of any rectangular three-dimensional space (rectangular prism, cuboid, etc.), can be determined simply by multiplying its length times its width times its height. This equation can also be thought of as multiplying the surface area of one of the rectangular space's faces by the dimension perpendicular to that face.


For example, let's say we want to determine the volume (in yd3) of the dining room in our house. We measure the dining room to be 4 yd long, 3 yd wide, and 2.5 yd high. To determine the room's volume, we simply multiply its length, width, and height:

4 × 3 × 2.5
= 12 × 2.5
= 30. The room has a volume of 30 yd3.



Cubes are rectangular spaces where all sides are equal in length. Thus, a cube's volume equation can be shortened from L × W × H to L3, etc.

, Find the area of its circular face via the area equation for circles: multiply the mathematical constant pi (3.1415926...) by the circle's radius (the distance from the center of the circle to one of its edges) times itself. Then, simply multiply this answer by the height of the cylinder to find the cylinder's volume. As always, ensure all values are in yards.


For example, let's say we want to determine the volume of a cylindrical hole in our back patio before installing a fountain. The hole is 1.5 yards across and 1 yard deep. Divide the distance across the hole in half to get the hole's radius: 0.75 yards. Then, multiply your variables according the the cylindrical volume equation:

(3.14159) × 0.752 × 1
= (3.14159) × 0.5625 × 1
= 1.767. The hole has a volume of 1.767 yd3.




, To calculate the volume of a sphere in cubic yards, all you need to know is its radius - the distance from its center to its outside edge - in yards. Simply cube this number (multiply it by itself two times), then multiply it by 4/3 pi to get the sphere's volume in cubic yards.


For example, let's say we want to find the volume inside a spherical hot air balloon. The hot air balloon is 10 yards across. Divide 10 in half to find the balloon's radius - 5 yards. Then, simply plug this into the equation for ""R"" as follows:

4/3 pi × (5)3

= 4/3 (3.14159) × 125
= 4.189 × 125
= 523.6. There are 523.6 yd3 in the balloon.



, Simply find the height and radius of a cone (in yards), then solve as if finding the volume of a cylinder. Multiply your result by 1/3 to get the volume of your cone.


For example, let's say that we want to find the volume of an ice cream cone. The ice cream cone is fairly small - it has a radius of 1 inch and a height of 5 inches. Converted to yards, these are .028 yards and .139 yards, respectively. Solve as follows:

1/3 (3.14159) × .0282 × .139
= 1/3 (3.14159) × 0.000784 × .139
= 1/3 × 0.000342
= 1.141-4. There are 1.141-4 yd3 in the ice cream cone.



, When confronted with a three-dimensional shape that doesn't have an elegant equation for its volume, try to break the space up into multiple spaces whose volume (in cubic yards) can be more easily calculated. Then, find the volume of these spaces individually, adding your results to find the final volume value.


Let's say, for instance, that we want to find the volume of a small grain silo. The silo has a cylindrical body 12 yards high with a radius of 1.5 yards. The silo also has a conic roof that is 1 yard high. By calculating the volume of the roof and the body of the silo separately, we can find the silo's total volume:

Pi × R2 × H + 1/3 Pi × R'2 × H'
(3.14159) × 1.52 × 12 + 1/3 (3.14159) × 1.52 × 1
= (3.14159) × 2.25 × 12 + 1/3 (3.14159) × 2.25 × 1
= (3.14159) × 27 + 1/3 (3.14159) × 2.25
= 84.822 + 2.356
= 87.178. The silo has a volume of 87.178 cubic yards.

Define the formula for surface are of a rectangular prism.,
Measure the length, height, and width of each side.,
Calculate the area of one of the sides of the prism, then multiply by two.,
Find the area of the other side of the prism and multiply by two.,
Calculate the area of the ends of the prism and multiply by two.,
Add the three separate measurements together.",How to Find Surface Area2," Like a cube, a rectangular prism has six sides, but unlike a cube, the sides are not identical. In a rectangular prism, only opposite sides are equal.Because of this, the surface of a rectangular prism must take into account the various side lengths making the formula SA = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac.


For this formula, a equals the width of the prism, b equals the height, and c equals the length.
Breaking down the formula, you can see that you are simply adding up all of the areas of each face of the object.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.

, All three measurements can vary, so all three need to be taken separately. Using a ruler, measure each side and write it down. Use the same units for each measurement.


Measure the length of the base to determine the length of the prism, and assign this to c.

Example: c = 5 cm

Measure the width of the base to determine the width of the prism, and assign this to a.

Example: a = 2 cm

Measure the height of the side to determine the height of the prism, and assign this to b.

Example: b = 3 cm


, Remember, there are 6 faces of a rectangular prism, but opposite sides are identical. Multiply the length and height, or c and a to find the area of one face. Take this measurement and multiply it by two to account for the opposite identical side.Example: 2 x (a x c) = 2 x (2 x 5) = 2 x 10 = 20 cm2


, Like with the first pair of faces, multiply the width and height, or a and b to find the area of another face of the prism. Multiply this measurement by two to account for the opposite identical sides.Example: 2 x (a x b) = 2 x (2 x 3) = 2 x 6 = 12 cm2


, The final two faces of the prism will be the ends. Multiply the length and width, or c and b to find their area. Multiply this measurement by two to account for both sides.Example: 2 x (b x c) = 2 x (3 x 5) = 2 x 15 = 30 cm2


, Because surface area is the total area of all of the faces of an object, the final step is to add all of the individually calculated areas together. Add the area measurements for all the sides together to find the total surface area.Example: Surface Area = 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 12 + 30 + 20 = 62 cm2.

Define the surface area formula for a triangular prism.,
Calculate the area of the triangular face and multiply by two.,
Measure each side of the triangle and the height of the prism.,
Determine the perimeter of the triangle.,
Multiply the perimeter of the base by the height of the prism.,
Add the two separate measurements together.",How to Find Surface Area3," A triangular prism has two identical triangular sides and three rectangular faces. To find the surface area, you must calculate the area of all of the sides and add them together. The surface area of a triangular prism is SA = 2A + PH, where A is the area of the triangular base, P is the perimeter of the triangular base, and h is the height of the prism.For this formula, A is the area of a triangle which is A = 1/2bh where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height.

P is simply the perimeter of the triangle which is calculated by adding all three sides of the triangle together.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.

, The area of a triangle is 1/2b*h where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. Because there are two identical triangle faces we can multiply the formula by two. This makes the calculation for both faces simply, b*h.The base, b, equals the length of the bottom of the triangle.
Example: b = 4 cm

The height, h, of the triangular base equals the distance between the bottom edge and the top peak.
Example: h = 3 cm

Area of the one triangle multiplied by 2= 2(1/2)b*h = b*h = 4*3 =12 cm

, To finish the surface area calculation, you need to know the length of each side of the triangle and the height of the prism. The height is the distance between the two triangular faces.


Example: H = 5 cm

The three sides refer to the three sides of the triangular base.
Example: S1 = 2 cm, S2 = 4 cm, S3 = 6 cm


, The perimeter of the triangle can be calculated simply by adding up all of the measured sides: S1 + S2 + S3.


Example: P = S1 + S2 + S3 = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 cm


, Remember, the height of the prism is distance between the two triangular bases. In other words, multiply P by H.


Example: P x H = 12 x 5 = 60 cm2


, You will need to add the two measurements from the previous two steps together to calculate the triangular prism's surface area.Example: 2A + PH = 12 + 60 = 72 cm2.

Define the surface area formula for a sphere.,
Measure the radius of the sphere.,
Square the radius.,
Multiply the squared radius by an approximation of pi.,
Multiply this product by four.",How to Find Surface Area4," A sphere has a curved surface and therefore the surface area must use the mathematical constant, pi. The surface area of a sphere is given by the equation SA = 4π*r2.For this formula, r equals the radius of the sphere. Pi, or π, should be approximated to 3.14.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.

, The radius of the sphere is half the diameter, or half the distance from one side of the center of the sphere to the other.Example: r = 3 cm


, To square a number, simply multiply it by itself. Multiply the measurement for r by itself. Remember, this formula can be rewritten as SA = 4π*r*r.Example: r2 = r x r = 3 x 3 = 9 cm2


, Pi is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.It is an irrational number that has many decimal digits. It is frequently approximated as 3.14. Multiply the squared radius by π, or 3.14, to find the area of one circular section of the sphere.Example: π*r2 = 3.14 x 9 = 28.26 cm2


, To complete the calculation, multiply by 4. Find the surface area of the sphere by multiplying the flat circular area by four.Example: 4π*r2 = 4 x 28.26 = 113.04 cm2

Find the area of the base and multiply by two.,
Calculate the surface area of the cylinder itself, using 2π*rh.,
Add the two separate measurements together.",How to Find Surface Area5," A cylinder has two circular ends enclosing a rounded surface. The formula for surface area of a cylinder is SA = 2π*r2 + 2π*rh, where r equals the radius of the circular base and h equals the height of the cylinder. Round pi or π off to 3.14.2π*r2 represents the surface area of the two circular ends while 2πrh is the surface area of the column connecting the two ends.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.

, The radius of a circle is half of the diameter, or half the distance from one side of the center of the circle to the other.The height is the total distance of the cylinder from end to end. Using a ruler, take these measurements and write them down.


Example: r = 3 cm

Example: h = 5 cm


, To find the area of the base, you simply use the formula for area of circle, or π*r2. To complete the calculation, square the radius and multiply by pi. Multiply by two to take into account the second identical circle on the other end of the cylinder.Example: Area of base = π*r2 = 3.14 x 3 x 3 = 28.26 cm2

Example: 2π*r2 = 2 x 28.26 = 56.52 cm2


, This is the formula to calculate the surface area of a tube. The tube is the space between the two circular ends of the cylinder. Multiply the radius by two, pi, and the height.Example: 2π*rh = 2 x 3.14 x 3 x 5 = 94.2 cm2


, Add the surface area of the two circles to the surface area of the space between the two circles to calculate the total surface area of the cylinder. Note, adding these two pieces together allows you to recognize the original formula: SA =2π*r2 + 2π*rh.Example: 2π*r2 + 2π*rh = 56.52 + 94.2 = 150.72 cm2

Find the square footage of the area where you're pouring.,
Find how thick your concrete must be.,
Divide your square footage by a coefficient based on the thickness of your concrete.,
Determine odd thicknesses via simple formula.,
Buy a little more concrete than you need.",How to Determine Cubic Yards2," When pouring concrete to, for instance, make a concrete patio, you're usually pouring concrete into a mold several inches to a foot thick. In this case, it's not necessary to use relatively complex formulas to determine the volume of concrete you'll need. Instead, use a contractor's trick to quickly figure the amount of concrete you need. Begin by finding the square footage of the area you're pouring into.


Remember - for square footage, we take our measurements in feet, not in yards, as above.
As a reminder, for squares or rectangles, this area can be found by multiplying Length × Width. For circles, it's Pi × R2. For more complex shapes, browse wikiHow's many surface-area calculation guides.


, This is simple - just measure the depth of the mold you're pouring into. Because we're pouring into a relatively shallow mold, we can take our measurements in inches, rather than having to measure in unwieldy fractions of a foot.

, All you need to do to determine your concrete yardage is to divide your number for square footage by a certain number - if your concrete needs to be thin, this number will be bigger. If your concrete needs to be thick, this number will be smaller. See below for common thicknesses, or proceed to the next step if your thickness doesn't match one of these:


If the concrete is 4 inches thick, divide the square footage by 81 to determine cubic yards.
If the concrete is 6 inches thick, divide the square footage by 54 to determine cubic yards.
If the concrete is 8 inches thick, divide the square footage by 40 to determine cubic yards.
If the concrete is 12 inches thick, divide the square footage by 27 to determine cubic yards.

, If you have a thickness that doesn't match any of the above examples, don't worry - it's easy to find the amount you need. Simply divide 324 over the thickness of your concrete (in inches). Then, multiply the answer by your square footage to determine the total concrete yardage.


Let's say our concrete for a 10 ft × 10 ft area needs to be 3.5 inches thick. In this case, we would find our yardage as follows:

324/3.5 = 92.6
10 × 10 = 100
100/92.6 = 1.08. We need 1.08 yd3 concrete.



, When pouring concrete, it's usually a good idea to buy a little extra just in case your measurements weren't exact. After all,dry concrete mix that you don't end up using can be saved and used for another project. However, if you don't have enough, you're in a bind - someone may have to run to the hardware store before you can continue. So, be sure to buy a little extra, especially for large projects.

Write down the equation for calculating the volume of a sphere.,
Find the radius.,
Cube the radius.,
Multiply the cubed radius by 4/3.,
Multiply the equation by π.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Sphere," This is the equation: V = ⁴⁄₃πr³. In this equation, ""V"" represents volume and ""r"" represents the radius of the sphere.;
, If you're given the radius, then you can move on to the next step. If you're given the diameter, then you can just divide it by two to get the radius. Once you know what it is, write it down. Let's say the radius we're working with is 1 inch (2.5 cm).If you're only given the surface area of the sphere, then you can find the radius by finding the square root of the surface area divided by 4π. In that case, r = root (surface area/4π)

, To cube the radius, simply multiply it by itself thrice, or raise it to the third power. For example, 1 inch3 is really just 1 inch (2.5 cm) x 1 inch (2.5 cm) x 1 inch (2.5 cm). The result of 1 inch3 is really just 1, since 1 multiplied by itself any number of times will be 1. You'll reintroduce the unit of measurement, inches, when you state your final answer. After you've done this, you can plug the cubed radius into the original equation for calculating the volume of a sphere, V = ⁴⁄₃πr³. Therefore, V = ⁴⁄₃π x 1


If the radius was 2 inches (5.1 cm), for example, then to cube it, you would find 23, which is 2 x 2 x 2, or 8.

, Now that you've plugged r3, or 1, into the equation, you can multiply this result by 4/3 to continue plugging in to the equation, V = ⁴⁄₃πr³. 4/3 x 1 = 4/3. Now, the equation will read V = ⁴⁄₃ x π x 1, or V = ⁴⁄₃π.

, This is the last step to finding the volume of a sphere. You can leave π as it is, stating the final answer as V = ⁴⁄₃π. Or, you can plug π into your calculator and multiply its value by 4/3. The value of π (approximately 3.14159) x 4/3 = 4.1887, which can be rounded to 4.19. Don't forget to state your units of measurement and to state the result in cubic units. The volume of a sphere with the radius of 1 is 4.19 in.3

Define the surface area formula for a square pyramid.,
Measure the slant height and base side.,
Find the area of the square base.,
Calculate the total area of the four triangular faces.,
Add the two separate areas together.",How to Find Surface Area6," A square pyramid has a square base and four triangular sides. Remember, the area of square is the length of one side squared. The area of a triangle is 1/2sl (side of the triangle times the length or height of the triangle). Because there are four triangles, to find the total surface area, you must multiply by four. Adding all of these faces together yields the equation of surface area for a square pyramid: SA = s2 + 2sl.For this equation, s refers to the length of each side of the square base and l refers to the slant height of each triangular side.
The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.

, The slant height, l, is the height of one of the triangular sides. It is the distance between the base to the peak of the pyramid as measured along one flat side. The base side, s, is the length of one side of the square base. Because the base is square, this measurement is the same for all sides. Use a ruler to make each measurement.Example: l = 3 cm

Example: s = 1 cm


, The area of a square base can be calculated by squaring the length of one side, or multiplying s by itself.Example: s2 = s x s = 1 x 1 = 1 cm2


, The second part of the equation involves the surface area of the remaining four triangular sides. Using the formula 2ls, multiply s by l and two. Doing so will allow you to find the area of each side.Example: 2 x s x l = 2 x 1 x 3 = 6 cm2


, Add the total area of the sides to the area of the base to calculate the total surface area.Example: s2 + 2sl = 1 + 6 = 7 cm2

Define the surface area formula for a cone.,
Measure the radius and height of the cone.,
Calculate the slant height (l) of the cone.,
Determine the area of the circular base.,
Calculate the surface area of the top of the cone.,
Add two areas together to find total surface area.",How to Find Surface Area7," A cone has a circular base and a rounded surface that tapers into a point. To find the surface area, you need to calculate the area of the circular base and the surface of the cone and add these two together. The formula for surface area of a cone is: SA = π*r2 + π*rl, where r is the radius of the circular base, l is the slant height of the cone, and π is the mathematical constant pi (3.14).The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.

, The radius is the distance from the center of the circular base to the side of the base. The height is the distance from the center of the base to the top peak of the cone, as measured through the center of the cone.Example: r = 2 cm

Example: h = 4 cm


, Because the slant height is actually the hypotenuse of a triangle, you must use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate it. Use the rearranged form, l = √ (r2 + h2), where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone. Example: l = √ (r2 + h2) = √ (2 x 2 + 4 x 4) = √ (4 + 16) = √ (20) = 4.47 cm


, The area of the base is calculated with the formula π*r2. After measuring the radius, square it (multiply it by itself) and then multiply that product by pi.Example: π*r2 = 3.14 x 2 x 2 = 12.56 cm2


, Using the formula π*rl, where r is the radius of the circle and l is the slant height previously calculated, you can find the surface area of the top part of the cone.Example: π*rl = 3.14 x 2 x 4.47 = 28.07 cm


, Calculate the final surface area of your cone by adding the area of the circular base to the calculation from the previous step.Example: π*r2 + π*rl = 12.56 + 28.07 = 40.63 cm2

Fill it partway with water.,
Mark the water level.,
Drop the object into the water and see if it absorbs water.,
Learn what to do if the object floats.,
Make a second mark where the new water level is.,
Understand why this method works.,
Find the volume using your container's printed measurements.,
Find the volume using a rectangular container.,
Find the volume using a cylindrical container.",How to Calculate the Volume of an Irregular Object1," This method involves submerging the object in water. If the object is hollow and not watertight, you cannot get an accurate measure of volume using this method. If the object absorbs water, make sure water will not damage it, and read the instructions carefully to see how to adjust the process. Never drop an electric or electronic item in water, as this could cause a dangerous electrical shock and/or damage the object beyond repair.


If you have access to a vacuum sealer, you may be able to seal a small object in a watertight plastic coating with minimal air inside. This will allow you to get a good estimate of volume, since the volume of the plastic used is likely to be relatively small compared to the volume of the object.;
, If you are measuring a small object, you could use a graduated cylinder or measuring cup, which have volume measurements printed on the side. Otherwise, find a watertight container with a volume that is simple to calculate, such as a cylinder or rectangular box. A bowl will not be as accurate, but you can treat it as a cylinder and get an approximate answer, especially if the object is very small compared to the bowl.


It's a good idea to locate a dry towel as well, since the object will be dripping water when removed from the container.

, Add enough water to submerge the object, but leave plenty of space between the water and the top of the container. If the object has an irregularly shaped base, such as rounded bottom corners, fill it up enough that the water level reaches a more regular portion, such as straight rectangular walls.

, If the container is transparent, mark the top of the water level on the outside with a wet-erase marker or other easily cleaned writing device. Otherwise, mark the water level on the inside using a piece of colored tape or other mark that will not be washed off by the water.


If you are using a graduated cylinder or measuring cup with volume measurements on the side, you do not need to make a mark. Just look for the volume measurement at the water's surface, and write this number down.

, Sink the object you want to measure completely in the water. If the object absorbs water, wait at least thirty seconds for it to absorb the water, then remove the object. The water level should have dropped, since some of the water is in the object. Remove your old mark or piece of colored tape, and replace it with a new one at the new water level. You may then drop the object into the water a second time and leave it there.

, If the object floats, attach a dense, heavy item to it and continue on to measure the volume of both combined. After you write down that result, repeat this method with the heavy item alone to find its volume. Take the combined volume of both items (your first result), then subtract the heavy item's volume. The answer is the volume of the original object.


When you take the volume of the heavy item alone, include anything you used to attach it to the original object, such as safety pins or tape.

, If you are using a graduated cylinder or measuring cup, you can write down the volume measurement at the new water height instead. Once you have done this, you can remove your object. You may not wish to leave the object underwater for more than a couple minutes, since even some ""waterproof"" objects can be affected if left underwater for too long.

, Since you know the water rose from one level to a higher level when the object was submerged, the volume of space between those two levels is the volume of the object. This is called the displacement method, and works because an object submerged in water always ""displaces"" an amount of water exactly equal to its volume. Depending on what type of container you used, there are different ways to calculate the volume of this displaced water, which is the same as your object's volume. Finish the problem by continuing on to the step that matches your container's description.

, If you used a graduated cylinder, measuring cup, or any other container that has volume measurements printed on the side, you already wrote down the two volumes you need to calculate the answer. Take the volume you wrote down when the object was submerged (the larger volume) and subtract the original volume of the water level (the smaller volume). The answer is the volume of the object.

, If you used a rectangular container, look at the space in the box between the first water mark and second water mark you made. This space forms a ""rectangular prism"", or box shape, that was filled with the displaced water. Find the volume of this space by measuring the height between the two water marks, then the length and width between the container's inside surfaces. As explained here, you can find the volume of this box-shaped space by multiplying its length, width, and height together (length x width x height). The answer to this multiplication problem is the volume of the object.


Do not measure the height of the entire container, just the height from one water mark to another.
Use this online calculator or search for another ""rectangular prism calculator"" that can multiply these numbers for you.

, If you used a cylindrical container, look at the space between the first water mark and the second water mark. This cylindrical space was once filled with the displaced water, and so its volume is equal to the object's volume. To find the volume of this cylindrical space, you'll need to measure two distances: its height and its diameter. First, measure the height between the two water marks, and write this down. Next, find the diameter of the cylinder by measuring the distance from the inside edge of the cylinder to the opposite side, through the center. Then divide the diameter by two to find the radius, which is the distance from the center of the circle to the edge. Write the radius down, then use your measurements to finish the calculations:


Calculate πr2, or π x the radius x the radius, to find the area of a circle across the cylinder. If you don't have a calculator with a π button, find one online or estimate by replacing it with 3.14.
Multiple your answer by the height between the water marks (which you measured at the beginning of this step) to find the volume of space the water took up. This answer is also the volume of your object.
You can get a more precise answer, or save yourself some math, if you enter your measurements on an online cylinder volume calculator.

Break down the object into more regular shapes.,
Write down the measurements of each section.,
Calculate the volume of each section.,
Add each result together.",How to Calculate the Volume of an Irregular Object2," If a word problem describes an irregular object and asks you to find its volume, you are probably expected to break it up into sections. The word problem may hint at this by describing the object as, for instance, ""a cone on top of a cube,"" or you may have to figure out from a diagram how to divide it into objects with easier shapes to measure.


Look for places where the irregular object is joined together at an unstated angle (not 90º). Can you ""cut it apart"" at that angle into two objects that have names, such as cylinders or pyramids? These do not have to be the same object.

, To find the volume of a cube, rectangular prism, or pyramid, you'll need to know its length, width, and height. To find the volume of a cylinder or cone, you'll need to know its radius and height. Read the word problem carefully and write down the measurements of each section, carefully labeling them or drawing a diagram of each section with the measurements written on it.


If the word problem tells you the diameter but not the radius, divide the diameter by two to get the radius.
You may need to do some addition or subtraction to find the measurements you need. For instance, say the problem tells you ""a building shaped like a cone on top of a cube has a height of 30 units, but the height of the cube section is only 20 units tall."" The height of the cone isn't listed, but logically it must be 30 units - 20 units = 10 units.

, Use the more common volume formulas for regular objects to find the volume of each section. Write down the result of each calculation and label it so you don't forget which section you've already calculated.


If you need a refresher on how to calculate volumes, see these instructions for common shapes.

, Once you've calculated the volume of each section separately, add every result together to get the volume of the entire object. Reread the word problem to make sure you didn't forget anything. If everything checks out, congratulations: you have found the answer.

Measure the side length of the base.,
Calculate the area of the base.,
Multiply the area of the base by the pyramid's height.,
Divide this answer by 3.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Square Pyramid1," Since, by definition, square pyramids have bases that are perfectly square, all of the sides of the base should be equal in length. Thus, for a square pyramid, you only need to find the length of one side.Consider a pyramid whose base is a square with side lengths of s=5cm{\displaystyle s=5{\text{cm}}}. This is the value you will use to find the area of the base.

If the sides of the base are not equal in length, you have a rectangular pyramid rather than a square pyramid. The volume formula for rectangular pyramids is very similar to the formula for square pyramids. If l{\displaystyle l} represents the length of the rectangular pyramid's base and w{\displaystyle w} represents its width, the pyramid's volume is V=13h∗l∗w{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}h*l*w}.
;
, Finding the volume begins by finding the two-dimensional area of the base. This is done by multiplying the base's length times its width. Because the base of a square pyramid is a square, its sides all have equal lengths, so the area of the base is equal to the length of one side squared (times itself).In the example, since the side lengths of the pyramid's base are all 5 cm, you can find the base's area as:


area=s2=(5cm)2=25cm2{\displaystyle {\text{area}}=s^{2}=(5{\text{cm}})^{2}=25{\text{cm}}^{2}}



Remember that two-dimensional areas are expressed in square units - square centimeters, square meters, square miles, and so on.


, Next, multiply the base area by the height of the pyramid. As a reminder, the height is the distance of the line segment stretching from the apex of the pyramid to the plane of the base at perpendicular angles to both.In the example, suppose the pyramid has a height of 9 cm. In this case, multiply the area of the base by this value as follows: 


25cm2∗9cm=225cm3{\displaystyle 25{\text{cm}}^{2}*9{\text{cm}}=225{\text{cm}}^{3}}



Remember that volumes are expressed in cubic units. In this case, because all the linear measurements are centimeters, the volume is in cubic centimeters.


, Finally, find the volume of the pyramid by dividing the value you just found from multiplying the base area by the height by 3. This will give you a final answer that represents the volume of the square pyramid.In the example, divide 225 cm3 by 3 to get an answer of 75 cm3 for the volume.

Use the height and base to calculate volume.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Square Pyramid2," Sometimes you will not be told the perpendicular height of the pyramid. Instead, you may be told - or may have to measure - the pyramid’s slant height. With the slant height, you will be able to use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the perpendicular height.A pyramid's slant height is the distance from its apex to the midpoint of one of the base sides. Measure to the midpoint of the side and not to one of the corners of the base. For this example, assume that you measure the slant height to be 13 cm, and you are told that the side length is 10 cm.

As a reminder, the Pythagorean Theorem can be expressed as the equation a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the perpendicular legs of the right triangle and c{\displaystyle c} is the hypotenuse.


, To use the Pythagorean Theorem, you need a right triangle. Imagine a right triangle slicing through the middle of the pyramid and perpendicular to the base of the pyramid. The slant height of the pyramid, called l{\displaystyle l}, is the hypotenuse of this right triangle. The base of this right triangle is one half the length of s{\displaystyle s}, the side of the square base of the pyramid., The Pythagorean Theorem uses the variables a, b, and c, but it helps to replace those with variables that have meaning for your problem. The slant height l{\displaystyle l} takes the place of c{\displaystyle c} in the Pythagorean Theorem. The leg of the right triangle, which is s2{\displaystyle {\frac {s}{2}}}, takes the place of b.{\displaystyle b.} You will be solving for the height of the pyramid, h{\displaystyle h}, which takes the place of a{\displaystyle a} in the Pythagorean Theorem.

This substitution will look like this:


a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}


h2+(s2)2=l2{\displaystyle h^{2}+({\frac {s}{2}})^{2}=l^{2}}




, Insert the measured values of s=10{\displaystyle s=10} and l=13{\displaystyle l=13}. Then proceed to solve the equation:


h2=l2−(s2)2{\displaystyle h^{2}=l^{2}-({\frac {s}{2}})^{2}}.....(original equation)


h=l2−(s2)2{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {l^{2}-({\frac {s}{2}})^{2}}}}.....(square root both sides)


h=132−(102)2{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {13^{2}-({\frac {10}{2}})^{2}}}}.....(substitute values)


h=169−52{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {169-5^{2}}}}.....(simplify fraction)


h=169−25{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {169-25}}}.....(simplify square)


h=144{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {144}}}.....(subtract)


h=12{\displaystyle h=12}.....(simplify square root)


, After using the calculations with the Pythagorean Theorem, you now have the information you need to calculate the volume of the pyramid as you normally would. Use the formula V=13s2h{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}s^{2}h} and solve, making sure to label your answer in cubic units.From the calculations, the height of the pyramid is 12 cm. Use this and the base side of 10 cm. to calculate the pyramid's volume:


V=13s2h{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}s^{2}h}


V=13(102)12{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}(10^{2})12}


V=13(100)(12){\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}(100)(12)}


V=400cm3{\displaystyle V=400{\text{cm}}^{3}}

Measure the pyramid’s edge height.,
Imagine a right triangle.,
Assign variables.,
Calculate the diagonal of the square base.,
Find the side of the base from the diagonal.,
Use the side and height to calculate volume.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Square Pyramid3," The edge height is the length of the edge of the pyramid, measured from the apex to one of the corners of the pyramid’s base. As before, you will then use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the perpendicular height of the pyramid.For this example, assume that the edge height can be measured to be 11 cm and you are given that the perpendicular height is 5 cm.


, As before, you need a right triangle to use the Pythagorean Theorem. In this case, however, your unknown value is the base of the pyramid. You know the perpendicular height and the edge height. If you imagine cutting the pyramid diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner and opening it up, the exposed inside face is a triangle. The height of that triangle is the perpendicular height of the pyramid. It divides the exposed triangle into two symmetrical right triangles. The hypotenuse of either right triangle is the edge height of the pyramid. The base of either right triangle is one-half the diagonal of the base of the pyramid.
, Use this imaginary right triangle and assign values to the Pythagorean Theorem. You know the perpendicular height, h,{\displaystyle h,} which is one leg of the Pythagorean Theorem, a{\displaystyle a}. The edge height of the pyramid, l,{\displaystyle l,} is the hypotenuse of this imaginary right triangle, so it takes the place of c{\displaystyle c}. The unknown diagonal of the base of the pyramid is the remaining leg of the right triangle, b.{\displaystyle b.} After you make these substitutions, the equation will look like this:


a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}


h2+b2=l2{\displaystyle h^{2}+b^{2}=l^{2}}


, You will need to rearrange the equation to isolate the variable b{\displaystyle b} and then solve for its value.h2+b2=l2{\displaystyle h^{2}+b^{2}=l^{2}}..........(revised equation)


b2=l2−h2{\displaystyle b^{2}=l^{2}-h^{2}}..........(substitute h2 from both sides)


b=l2−h2{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {l^{2}-h^{2}}}}..........(square root both sides)


b=112−52{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {11^{2}-5^{2}}}}..........(insert numerical values)


b=121−25{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {121-25}}}..........(simplify squares)


b=96{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {96}}}..........(subtract values)


b=9.80{\displaystyle b=9.80}..........(simplify square root)

Double this value to find the diagonal of the square base of the pyramid. Thus, the diagonal of the pyramid’s base is 9.8*2=19.6 cm.


, The base of the pyramid is a square. The diagonal of any square is equal to the length of a side times the square root of 2. Conversely, you can find the side of the square from its diagonal by dividing by the square root of 2.For this sample pyramid, the diagonal has been calculated to be 19.6 cm. Therefore, the side is equal to:


s=19.62=19.61.41=13.90{\displaystyle s={\frac {19.6}{\sqrt {2}}}={\frac {19.6}{1.41}}=13.90}




, Return to the original formula to calculate the volume using the side and perpendicular height.V=13s2h{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}s^{2}h}


V=1313.92∗5{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}13.9^{2}*5}

,

 Example:  Consider V=a362{\displaystyle V={\frac {a^{3}}{6{\sqrt {2}}}}}, given that a=6{\displaystyle a=6}. Then, you can see that V=6362=21662{\displaystyle V={\frac {6^{3}}{6{\sqrt {2}}}}={\frac {216}{6{\sqrt {2}}}}}


, Note that √2 is similar to 1.41.

 Example: 6∗1.41=8.46{\displaystyle 6*1.41=8.46}

 This gives you V=21662=2168.46{\displaystyle V={\frac {216}{6{\sqrt {2}}}}={\frac {216}{8.46}}}

Understand the volume of a rectangle equals it's length x width x height.,
Measure the length of a box.,
Measure the width of the box next to the length.,
Measure the height of the box.,
Multiply the three sides together.,
Add the ""units3"" to your volume.",How to Calculate Volume of a Box1," If your box is a rectangular prism or a cube, the only information you need is the box's length, width, and height. You can then multiply them together to get volume. This formula is often abbreviated as V = l x w x h.



Sample Question: ""If I have a box with a length of 10cm, width of 4cm, and height of 5cm, what is the volume of the box?""
V = l x w x h
V = 10cm x 4cm x 5cm
V = 200cm3

""Height"" may be replaced with ""depth."" For example, ""The box has a length of 10cm, width of 4cm, and is 5cm deep."";
, If your are looking down at your box, the top appears to be a flat rectangle/The length the longest side of this rectangle. Write this number down as ""length.""


Make sure you use the same measurement for each side -- if you measure one side in inches, you need to measure them all in inches.

, The width of the box is the other edge next to the length. If you are looking one side of the box, the width is the side the forms an ""L"" with the length. Write down this measurement as ""width.""


The width is always the shorter side.

, This is the last side you have not measured, and is the the distance from the top of the box to the ground. Write this measurement down as ""height.""


Depending on how the box is laying, which side you call ""height"" or ""length"" might be different. However, it doesn't matter what side you call the length, just that you measure 3 different sides.

, Remember, the equation for volume is V = length x width x height, so simply multiply all three sides together to get your volume. Be sure to include the units you used to measure with as well, so you don't forget what your numbers mean.

, Volume is a measurement, but if you don't know what the measuring system your number will be meaningless. The correct way write out volume is with your type of measurement cubed. For example, if I measured all the sides in inches, my final answer would be in ""inches3."" For example.



Sample Question: ""If I have a box with a length of 2 feet, width of 1 foot, and height of 3 feet what is the volume of the box?""
V = l x w x h
V = 2ft x 1ft x 4ft
Volume = 8ft3


Advanced Note:' This is because volume tell you how many small cubes you could fit in the box. In the previous example, this means we could fit eight separate 1 foot cubes in our box.

Multiply the length, the width, and the height.,
State your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Rectangular Prism," The length is the longest side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism.


Ex: Length = 5 in.;
, The width is the shorter side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism.


Ex: Width = 4 in.

, The height is the part of the rectangular prism that rises up. Imagine that the height is what stretches up a flat rectangle until it becomes a three-dimensional shape.


Ex: Height = 3 in.

, You can multiply them in any order to get the same different result. The formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism is the following: Volume = Length * Height * Width, or V = L * H * W.


Ex: V = 5 in. * 4 in. * 3 in. = 60 in.

, Since you're calculating volume, you're working in a three-dimensional space. Just take your answer and state it in cubic units. Whether you're working in feet, inches, or centimeters, you should state your answer in cubic units.

Find the volume of cylinders.,
Find the volume of a pyramid.,
Add the volume of the parts together to find the volume of complicated shapes.",How to Calculate Volume of a Box2," Cylinders are tubes, where the top and bottom are circles. To find volume of a cylinder, use the equation V = pi x r2 x h. Where pi = 3.14, r is the radius of the top circle, and h is the height.


To find the volume of a cone, or pyramid with a circle for the bottom, use the same equation time 1/3. So, Volume of a Cone = 1/3(pi x r2 x h)

, Pyramids have one side, or base, and all of the other sides comes to a point. To find volume, multiply the area the base by the height, and then multiply that by the fraction 1/3. Thus, Volume of a Pyramid = 1/3(base x height).


Most pyramids have square or rectangular bases. The area of a base is found by multiplying the length of the base by the width.

, For example, if I need to find the volume of an ""L"" shaped box, there are more than three sides to measure. If you view the box as two smaller boxes, however, you can find the volume of each smaller box and add them together to get the final volume. With our ""L"" shaped box, for example, we can view the vertical line as a rectangular box and the bottom horizontal line as a square box.


Thought it becomes complicated, there are many ways to find the volume for any shape.

Measure the sides of the carton.,
Convert the measurements into meters, if necessary.,
Multiply the length, width, and height.,
Note the CBM.",How to Calculate CBM1," You'll need to know the length, width, and height of the rectangular carton. Use a measuring stick to find all three distances and mark them down separately.


CBM is a measurement of volume, so you'll be using the standard volume formula for rectangular prisms.

Example: Calculate the CBM of a rectangular package with a length of 15 cm, a width of 10 cm, and a height of 8 cm.;
, For small packages, you may end up taking measurements in centimeters, inches, or feet. Before you can calculate CBM, you'll need to convert each measurement into its equivalent value in meters.


The exact conversion equation will vary depending on the unit used in your original measurements.

Example: The original measurements were taken in centimeters. To convert centimeters into meters, divide the number of centimeters by a conversion factor of 100. Repeat this process for all three measurements. The unit for the length, width, and height should be the same.

Length: 15 cm / 100 = 0.15 m
Width: 10 cm / 100 = 0.1 m
Height: 8 cm / 100 = 0.08 m



, Following the formula for CBM, multiply together the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism.Written in abbreviated form the formula you'll need to use looks like: CBM = L * W * H

Where L = length, W = width, and H = height



Example: CBM = 0.15 m * 0.1 m * 0.08 m = 0.0012 cubic meters

, The product of the original three dimensions will be both the volume and CBM of the individual package unit.



Example: The CBM of this package is 0.0012. This signifies that the package will take up 0.0012 cubic meters of space.

Multiply the area of the triangular base face times the height.,
State your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Prism1," The formula is simply V = 1/2 x length x width x height. However, we'll be taking this formula apart further to use the formula V = area of base x height. You can find the area of the base by using the formula for finding the area of a triangle -- multiplying 1/2 by the length and width of the base.;
, To calculate the volume of a triangular prism, you need to first find the area of the triangular base. Find the area of the base of the prism by multiplying 1/2 times the base of the triangle times its height.Ex: If the height of the triangular base is 5 cm and the base of the triangular prism is 4 cm, then the area of the base is 1/2 x 5 cm x 4 cm, which is 10 cm2.

, Let's say the height of this triangular prism is 7 cm.

, Simply multiply the area of the base times the height. After you multiply the base and height, you'll have the volume of the triangular prism.


Ex:10 cm2 x 7 cm = 70 cm3

Measure the length and radius of the carton.,
Convert these measurements into meters, when applicable.,
Plug the values into the volume equation.,
Note the CBM.",How to Calculate CBM2," When dealing with tubes and other cylindrical packages, you'll need to know the height or length of the cylinder, as well as the radius of its circular sides. Find these measurements using a measuring stick, then write both down separately.


Since CBM is actually a measurement of volume, you'll need to use the standard volume formula for cylinders when calculating the CBM of a cylindrical package.
Note that the radius of the circular side is half its diameter, and the diameter is the distance from one side of the circular face to the other. To measure the radius, measure the diameter of one circular face and split the number in half.

Example: Calculate the CBM of a cylindrical package with a height of 64 inches and a diameter of 20 inches.

Find the radius of this package by dividing the diameter in half: 20 inches / 2 = 10 inches



, For many small packages, you may naturally take measurements in centimeters, inches, or feet. You must convert such measurements into their equivalent value in meters before calculating cubic meters.


The conversion factor you'll need to use will depend upon the unit used in your original measurement.

Example: These original measurements were taken in inches. To convert inches into meters, you need to divide the number of inches by a conversion factor of 39.37.Repeat this process for both measurements.

Height: 64 inches / 39.37 = 1.63 m
Radius: 10 inches / 39.37 = 0.25 m



, To find the volume and CBM of a cylinder, you need to multiply the cylinder's height with its radius. You must then multiply the product of those two values by the fixed value of pi.When written in abbreviated form, the formula you need to use looks like: CBM = H * R2 * π

Where H = height, R = radius, and π = the constant pi, 3.14



Example: CBM = 1.63 m * (0.25 m)2 * 3.14 = 1.63 m * 0.0625 m2 * 3.14 = 0.32 cubic meters

, The product you calculated during the previous step should be the volume and CBM of the individual cylindrical unit.



Example: The CBM of this package is 0.32, meaning that it will take up 0.32 cubic meters of space.

"
"
Measure the greatest distances.,
Convert the measurements into meters, if needed.,
Multiply the length, width, and height.,
Note the CBM.",How to Calculate CBM3," You'll need to treat an irregularly shaped package like a rectangular package when calculating CBM, but since there is no consistent length, width, and height, you must identify the longest, widest, and tallest portions of the package and measure those maximum distances with some type of measuring stick. Mark each of these three measurements down separately.


Even though CBM is a measurement of volume, there is no standard formula to use when calculating the volume of an irregularly shaped three-dimensional object. Instead of finding an exact volume, you can only calculate an estimated one.Example: Calculate the CBM of an irregularly shaped package with a maximum length of 5 feet, a maximum width of 3 feet, and a maximum height of 4 feet.

, If you inadvertently took the length, height, and width in centimeters, inches, or feet, you need to convert those measurements into meters before calculating the package's cubic meters.


Note that the conversion factor will vary based on the unit used when originally measuring the three sides of the package.

Example: The original measurements in this example were taken in feet. To convert feet into meters, divide the number of feet by a conversion factor of 3.2808.Repeat this process for all three measurements.

Length: 5 ft / 3.2808 = 1.52 m
Width: 3 feet / 3.2808 = 0.91 m
Height: 4 feet / 3.2808 = 1.22 m



, Treat the package as though it were a rectangular unit and multiply together the maximum length, width, and height of the unit.


If written in abbreviated form, the formula will look like: CBM = L * W * H

Where L = length, W = width, and H = height



Example: CBM = 1.52 m * 0.91 m * 1.22 m = 1.69 cubic meters

, After finding the product of the three maximum measurements, you should know the volume and CBM of this individual, irregularly shaped package.



Example: The estimated CBM of this package is 1.69. Even though it may not fill the entire space, the unit will require 1.69 cubic meters of space to pack and ship.

"
"
Find the unit CBM for each batch.,
Multiply each unit CBM by the number of units.,
Add the batch CBM totals together.,
Note the total CBM of the shipment.",How to Calculate CBM4," If the shipment contains multiple batches, and each batch consists of a certain number of equally sized packages, you can calculate the total CBM without calculating the CBM of each individual carton. You'll need to start by finding the unit CBM of the standard carton in each batch.


Use whichever unit CBM calculation is needed based on the shape of the package (rectangular, cylindrical, or irregular).

Example: The rectangular, cylindrical, and irregular packages described in the previous sections of this article are all being delivered in a single shipment. This means that unit CBM of the rectangular batch is 0.0012 m3, the unit CBM of the cylindrical batch is 0.32 m3, and the unit CBM of the irregular batch is 1.69 m3.

, Within each batch, multiply the unit CBM you calculated by the number of units or packages in that particular batch. Repeat this process until you have gone through each batch within the shipment.



Example: There are 50 packages in the rectangular batch, 35 packages in the cylindrical batch, and 8 packages in the irregular batch.

Rectangular batch CBM: 0.0012 m3 * 50 = 0.06 m3

Cylindrical batch CBM: 0.32 m3 * 35 = 11.2 m3

Irregular batch CBM: 1.69 m3 * 8 = 13.52 m3




, After calculating the total CBM of each batch within the shipment, you'll need to add those totals together to find the overall CBM of the entire shipment.



Example: Total CBM = 0.06 m3 + 11.2 m3 + 13.52 m3 = 24.78 m3


, Review your work. At this point, you should know the total CBM of the entire shipment. No further calculations should be needed.



Example: The total CBM of the entire shipment, including all three batches, will be 24.78. This means that 24.78 cubic meters of space are required to pack and ship all of the units involved.

State your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Prism2," The formula is simply V = side3. A cube is a prism that happens to have three equal sides., All of the sides are equal, so it doesn't matter which side you choose.


Ex: Length = 3 cm.

, To cube a number, just multiply it by itself twice. The cube of ""a"" is ""a x a x a,"" for example. Since all of the lengths of the sides of the cube are equal, you don't have to find the area of the base and multiply it by the height and then multiply it by the length. Multiplying any two sides of the cube will give you the area of the base, and any third side could represent the height. You can still think of this as multiplying the length, width, and height when they all just happen to be the same.


Ex: 3 cm3 = 3 cm. * 3 cm. * 3 cm. = 27 cm.3

, The length is the longest side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the rectangular prism.


Ex: Length = 10 cm.

, The width of the rectangular prism is the shorter side of the flat surface of the rectangle on the top or bottom of the shape.


Ex: Width = in 8 cm.

, The height is the part of the rectangular prism that rises up. You can imagine the height of the rectangular prism as the part that stretches up a flat rectangle and makes it three-dimensional.


Ex: Height = 5 cm.

, You can multiply them in any order to get the same result. Using this method, you have essentially found the area of the rectangular base ( 10 x 8) and then have multiplied it by its height, 5. But to find the volume of this prism, you can multiply the lengths of the sides in any order.

Multiply the area of the pentagonal base face times the height.,
State your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Prism5," The formula is V = x height of the prism. You can use the first part of the formula to find the area of the pentagonal base face. You can think of this as finding the area of the five triangles that make up a regular polygon. The side is simply the width of one triangle, and the apothem is the height of one of the triangles. You'll be multiplying by 1/2 because that's part of finding the area of a triangle and then multiplying this by 5 because 5 triangles make up the pentagon.For more information on finding the apothem if one is not provided for you, look here., Let's say the length of a side is 6 cm and the length of the apothem is 7 cm. Just plug these numbers into the formula:


A = 1/2 x 5 x side x apothem
A = 1/2 x 5 x 6 cm x 7 cm = 105 cm2


, Let's say the height of the shape is 10 cm.

, Just multiply the area of the pentagonal base, 105 cm2, times the height, 10 cm, to find the volume of the regular pentagonal prism.


105 cm2 x 10 cm = 1050 cm3


, The final answer is 1050 cm3.

Multiply the area of the base by the height of the cone.,
Divide the product by three.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Cone," If you already know the radius, then you can move on to the next step. If you know the diameter, divide it by 2 to get the radius. If you know the circumference, divide it by 2π to get the diameter. And if you don't know any of the measurements of the shape, just use a ruler to measure the widest pie circular base (the diameter) and divide that number by 2 to get the radius. Let's say the radius of this cone's circular base is .5 inches (1.3 cm).

, To find the area of the base circle, you can just use the same formula you'd use to find the area of a circle: A = πr2. Plug "".5"" in for r to get A = π(.5)2 and square the radius and multiply it by the value of π to find the area of the circular base. π(.5)2 = .79 in.2.

, If you know it already, write it down. If you don't know it, use a ruler to measure it. Let's say the height of the cone is 1.5 inches (1.3 cm). Make sure that the height of the cone is written in the same measurements as the radius.

, Multiply the area of the base, .79 in.2, by the height, 1.5 in. So, .79 in.2 x 1.5 in = 1.19 in.3
, Simply divide 1.19 in.3 by 3 to find the volume of a cone. 1.19 in.3/3 = .40 in.3. Always state the volume in cubic units because it's a measure of three-dimensional space.

Recognize a cube.,

Find the length of one side of the cube.,
Plug the side length into the formula V = s3 and calculate.,
Be sure to state your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate Volume1," A cube is a three-dimensional shape that has six identical square faces.In other words, it is a box shape with equal sides all around.

A 6-sided die is a good example of a cube you might find in your house. Sugar cubes, and children's letter blocks are also usually cubes.;
, Since all of the side lengths of a cube are the same, the formula for the volume of a cube is really easy. It is V = s3 where V stands for volume, and s is the length of the sides of the cube.


To find s3, simply multiply a by itself 3 times: s3 = s * s * s

, Depending on your assignment, the cube will either be labeled with this information, or you may have to measure the side length with a ruler. Remember that since it is a cube, all of the side lengths should be equal so it doesn't matter which one you measure.


If you are not 100% sure that your shape is a cube, measure each of the sides to determine if they are equal. If they are not, you will need to use the method below for Calculating the Volume of a Rectangular Solid.

, For example, if you find that the length of the sides of your cube is 5 inches, then you should write the formula out as follows: V = (5 in)3. 5 in * 5 in * 5 in = 125 in3, the volume of our cube!

, In the above example, the side length of our cube was measured in inches, so the volume was given in cubic inches. If the side length of the cube had been 3 centimeters, for example, the volume would be V = (3 cm)3, or V = 27cm3.

Be sure to express your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate Volume2," A rectangular solid, also known as a rectangular prism, is a three-dimensional shape with six sides that are all rectangles.In other words, a rectangular solid is simply a three-dimensional rectangle, or box shape.

A cube is really just a special rectangular solid in which the sides of all of the rectangles are equal.

, The formula for the volume of a rectangular solid is Volume = length * width * height, or V = lwh.

, The length is the longest side of the rectangular solid that is parallel to the ground or surface it is resting on. The length may be given in a diagram, or you may need to measure it with a ruler or tape measure.


Example: The length of this rectangular solid is 4 inches, so l = 4 in.
Don't worry too much about which side is the length, which is the width, etc. As long as you end up with three different measurements, the math will come out the same regardless of how your arrange the terms.

, The width of the rectangular solid is the measurement of the shorter side of the solid, parallel to the ground or surface the shape is resting on. Again, look for a label on the diagram indicating the width, or measure your shape with a ruler or tape measure.


Example: The width of this rectangular solid is 3 inches, so w = 3 in.
If you are measuring the rectangular solid with a ruler or tape measure, remember to take and record all measurements in the same units. Don't measure one side in inches another in centimeters; all measurements must use the same unit!

, This height is the distance from the ground or surface the rectangular solid is resting on to the top of the rectangular solid. Locate the information in your diagram, or measure the height using a ruler or tape measure.


Example: The height of this rectangular solid is 6 inches, so h = 6 in.

, Remember that V = lwh.

In our example, l = 4, w = 3, and h = 6. Therefore V = 4 * 3 * 6, or 72.

, Since our example rectangle was measured in inches, the volume should be written as 72 cubic inches, or 72 in3.


If the measurements of our rectangular solid were: length = 2 cm, width = 4 cm, and height = 8 cm, the Volume would be 2 cm * 4 cm * 8 cm, or 64cm3.

Find the radius of the base.,
Measure the object if the radius is not given.,
Calculate the area of the circular base.,
Find the height of the cylinder.,
Multiply the area of the base times the height of the cylinder to find the volume.,
Remember to state your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate Volume3," A cylinder is a three-dimensional shape that has two identical flat ends that are circular in shape, and a single curved side that connects them.A can is a good example of a cylinder, so is a AA or AAA battery.

, To calculate the volume of a cylinder, you must know its height and the radius of the circular base (the distance from the center of the circle to its edge) at the top and bottom. The formula is V = πr2h, where V is the Volume, r is the radius of the circular base, h is the height, and π is the constant pi.


In some geometry problems the answer will be given in terms of pi, but in most cases it is sufficient to round pi to 3.14. Check with your instructor to find out what she would prefer.
The formula for finding the volume of a cylinder is actually very similar to that for a rectangular solid: you are simply multiplying the height of the shape by the surface area of its base. In a rectangular solid, that surface area is l * w, for the cylinder it is πr2, the area of a circle with radius r.

, If it is given in the diagram, simply use that number. If the diameter is given instead of the radius, you simply need to divide the value by 2 to get the radius (d = 2r).

, Be aware that getting precise measurement of a circular solid can be a bit tricky. One option is to measure the base of the cylinder across the top with a ruler or tape measure. Do your best to measure the width of the cylinder at its widest part, and divide that measurement by 2 to find the radius.

Another option is to measure the circumference of the cylinder (the distance around it) using a tape measure or a length of string that you can mark and then measure with a ruler. Then plug the measurement into the formula: C (circumference) = 2πr. Divide the circumference by 2π (6.28) and that will give you the radius.
For example, if the circumference you measured was 8 inches, the radius would be 1.27in.
If you need a really precise measurement, you might use both methods to make sure that your measurements are similar. If they are not, double check them. The circumference method will usually yield more accurate results.

, Plug the radius of the base into the formula πr2. Then multiply the radius by itself one time, and then multiply the product by π. For example:


If the radius of the circle is equal to 4 inches, the area of the base will be A = π42.
42 = 4 * 4, or 16. 16 * π (3.14) = 50.24 in2

If the diameter of the base is given instead of the radius, remember that d = 2r. You simply need to divide the diameter in half to find the radius.

, This is simply the distance between the two circular bases, or the distance from the surface the cylinder is resting on to its top. Find the label in your diagram that indicates the height of the cylinder, or measure the height with a ruler or tape measure.

, Or you can save a step and simply plug the values for the cylinder's dimensions into the formula V = πr2h. For our example cylinder with radius 4 inches and height 10 inches:


V = π4210
π42 = 50.24
50.24 * 10 = 502.4
V = 502.4

, Our example cylinder was measured in inches, so the volume must be expressed in cubic inches: V = 502.4in3. If our cylinder had been measured in centimeters, the volume would be expressed in cubic centimeters (cm3).

Calculate the area of the base.,
Find the height of the pyramid.,
Multiply the area of the base of the pyramid by its height, and divide by 3 to find the volume.,
Remember to express your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate Volume4," A pyramid is a three-dimensional shape with a polygon for a base, and lateral faces that taper at an apex (the point of the pyramid).A regular pyramid is a pyramid in which the base of the pyramid is a regular polygon, meaning that all of the sides of the polygon are equal in length, and all of the angles are equal in measure.We most commonly imagine a pyramid as having a square base, and sides that taper up to a single point, but the base of a pyramid can actually have 5, 6, or even 100 sides!
A pyramid with a circular base is called a cone, which will be discussed in the next method.

, The formula for the volume of a regular pyramid is V = 1/3bh, where b is the area of the base of the pyramid (the polygon at the bottom) and h is the height of the pyramid, or the vertical distance from the base to the apex (point).


The volume formula is the same for right pyramids, in which the apex is directly above the center of the base, and for oblique pyramids, in which the apex is not centered.

, The formula for this will depend on the number of sides the base of the pyramid has. In the pyramid in our diagram, the base is a square with sides that are 6 inches in length. Remember that the formula for the area of a square is A = s2 where s is the length of the sides. So for this pyramid, the area of the base is (6 in) 2, or 36in2.


The formula for the area of a triangle is: A = 1/2bh, where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height.
It is possible to find the area of any regular polygon using the formula A = 1/2pa, where A is the area, p is the perimeter of the shape, and a is the apothem, or distance from the center of the shape to the midpoint of any of its sides. This is a pretty involved calculation that goes beyond the scope of this article, but check out Calculate-the-Area-of-a-Polygon for some great instructions on how to use it. Or you can make your life easy and search for a Regular Polygon Calculator online., In most cases, this will be indicated in the diagram. In our example, the height of the pyramid is 10 inches.

, Remember that the formula for the volume is V = 1/3bh. In our example pyramid, that had a base with area 36 and height 10, the volume is: 36 * 10 * 1/3, or 120.


If we had a different pyramid, with a pentagonal base with area 26, and height of 8, the volume would be: 1/3 * 26 * 8 = 69.33.

, The measurements of our example pyramid were given in inches, so its volume must be expressed in cubic inches, 120in. If our pyramid had been measured in meters, the volume would be expressed in cubic meters (m3) instead.3

Find the radius of the semi-circle.,
Find the area of the full circle and divide it by two.,
Remember to state your answer in square units.",How to Find the Area of a Semicircle," You'll need the radius to find the area of the semi-circle. Let's say the radius of the semi-circle is 5 centimeter (2.0 in).


If you're only given the diameter of the circle, you can divide it by two to get the radius. For example, if the diameter of the circle is 10 centimeter (3.9 in), then you can divide it by 2 (10/2) to get 5 centimeter (2.0 in) as the radius.;
, The formula for finding the area of a full circle is πr2, where ""r"" represents the radius of the circle. Since you're finding the area of a semi-circle, you'll be looking for half of the area of a circle, which means you have to use the formula for finding the area of a semi-circle and then divide it by two. So, the formula you'll have to use to find the area of a semi-circle is πr2/2. Now, just plug ""5 centimeter (2.0 in)"" into the formula to get your answer. You can either use the closest approximation for π with your calculator, substitute 3.14 for π, or you can just leave the symbol in place. Here's how you do it:


Area = (πr2)/2
Area = (π x 5 cm x 5 cm)/2
Area = (π x 25 cm2)/2
Area = (3.14 x 25 cm2)/2
Area = 39.25 cm2


, Since you're finding the area of a shape, you'll have to use square units (such as cm2) in your answer to indicate that you're working with a two-dimensional object. If you're calculating volume, then you'll be working with cubic units (such as cm3).

Calculate the area of the circular base of the cone.,
Find the height of the cone.,
Multiply the height of the cone by the area of the base.,
Now multiply the result by 1/3 (or simply divide by 3) to find the volume of the cone.,
Remember to express your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate Volume5," A cone is a 3-dimesional solid that has a circular base and a single vertex (the point of the cone). Another way to think of this is that a cone is a special pyramid that has a circular base.If the vertex of the cone is directly above the center of the circular base, the cone is called a ""right cone"". If it is not directly over the center, the cone is called an ""oblique cone."" Fortunately, the formula for calculating the area of a cone is the same whether it is right or oblique.

, The formula is V = 1/3πr2h, where r is the radius of the circular base of the cone, h is the height of the cone, and π is the constant pi, which can be rounded to 3.14.


The πr2 part of the formula refers to the area of the circular base of the cone. The formula for the volume of the cone is thus 1/3bh, just like the formula for the volume of a pyramid in the method above!

, To do this, you need to know the radius of the base, which should be listed in your diagram. If you are instead given the diameter of the circular base, simply divide that number by 2, since the diameter is simply 2 times the radios (d = 2r). Then plug the radius into the formula A = πr2 to calculate the area.


In the example in the diagram, the radius of the circular base of the cone is 3 inches. When we plug that into the formula we get: A = π32.
32 = 3 *3, or 0, so A = 9π.
A = 28.27in2


, This is the vertical distance between the base of the cone, and its apex. In our example, the height of the cone is 5 inches.

, In our example, the area of the base is 28.27in2 and the height is 5in, so bh = 28.27 * 5 = 141.35.

, In the above step, we actually calculated the volume of the cylinder that would be formed if the walls of the cone extended straight up to another circle, instead of slanting in to a single point. Dividing by 3 gives us the volume of just the cone itself.

In our example, 141.35 * 1/3 = 47.12, the volume of our cone.
To restate it, 1/3π325 = 47.12

, Our cone was measured in inches, so its volume must be expressed in cubic inches: 47.12in3.

Multiply the result by π to find the volume of the sphere.,
Express your answer in cubic units.",How to Calculate Volume6," A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional object, in which every point on the surface is an equal distance from the center. In other words, a sphere is a ball-shaped object., The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = 4/3πr3 (stated: ""four-thirds times pi r-cubed"") where r is the radius of the sphere, and π is the constant pi (3.14)., If the radius is given in the diagram, then finding r is simply a matter of locating it. If the diameter is given, you must divide this number by 2 to find the radius. For example, the radius of the sphere in the diagram is 3 inches.

, If you need to measure a spherical object (like a tennis ball) to find the radius, first find a piece of string large enough to wrap around the object. Then wrap the string around the object at its widest point and mark the points where the string overlaps itself. Then measure the string with a ruler to find the circumference. Divide that value by 2π, or 6.28, and that will give you the radius of the sphere.

For example, if you measure a ball and find its circumference is 18 inches, divide that number by 6.28 and you will find that the radius is 2.87in.
Measuring a spherical object can be a little tricky, so you might want to take 3 different measurements, and then average them together (add the three measurements together, then divide by 3) to make sure you have the most accurate value possible.
For example, if your three circumference measurements were 18 inches, 17.75 inches, and 18.2 inches, you would add those three values together (18 + 17.5 + 18.2 = 53.95) and divide that value by 3 (53.95/3 = 17.98). Use this average value in your volume calculations.

, Cubing a number simply means multiplying the number by itself 3 times, so r3 = r * r * r. In our example, r = 3, so r3 = 3 * 3 * 3, or 27.

, You can either use your calculator, or do the multiplication by hand and then simplify the fraction. In our example, multiplying 27 by 4/3 = 108/3, or 36.

, The last step in calculating the volume is simply to multiply the result so far by π. Rounding π to two digits is usually sufficient for most math problems (unless your teacher specified otherwise,) so multiply by 3.14 and you have your answer.


In our example, 36 * 3.14 = 113.09.

, In our example, the measurement of the radius of the sphere was in inches, so our answer is actually V = 113.09 cubic inches (113.09 in3).

If you don't know the radius, then you can use a ruler to measure the widest part of the circle and then divide it by 2. This will be more accurate than trying to measure half of the diameter. Let's say that the radius of this cylinder is 1 inch (2.5 cm). Write it down.


If you know the diameter of the circle, just divide it by 2.
If you know the circumference, then you can divide it by 2π to get the radius.

, To do this, just use the formula for finding the area of a circle, A = πr2. Just plug the radius you found into the equation. Here's how to do it:


A = π x 12 =
A = π x 1.
Since π is approximately 3.14 to three digits, you can say that the area of the circular base is 3.14 in.2


, If you know the height already, move on. If not, use a ruler to measure it. The height is the distance between the edges of the two bases. Let's say the height of the cylinder is 4 inches (10.2 cm). Write it down.

, You can think of the volume of the cylinder as the volume of the area of the base being extended throughout the height of the cylinder. Since you know that the area of the base is 3.14 in.2 and that the height is 4 in., you can just multiply the two together to get the volume of the cylinder. 3.14 in.2 x 4 in. = 12.56 in.3 This is your final answer.


Always state your final answer in cubic units because volume is the measure of a three-dimensional space.

, Remember that we already know the square's area is equal to s2. If you can get s2 alone on side, you'll have a new equation for area:


s2+s2=d2{\displaystyle s^{2}+s^{2}=d^{2}}

Simplify: 2s2=d2{\displaystyle 2s^{2}=d^{2}}

Divide both sides by two: s2=d22{\displaystyle s^{2}={\frac {d^{2}}{2}}}

Area = s2=d22{\displaystyle s^{2}={\frac {d^{2}}{2}}}

Area = d22{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}}{2}}}


, These steps have proven that the formula Area = d22{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}}{2}}} works for all squares. Just plug in the length of the diagonal for d and solve.

For example, let's say a square has a diagonal that measures 10 cm.

Area = 1022{\displaystyle {\frac {10^{2}}{2}}}= 1002{\displaystyle {\frac {100}{2}}}= 50 square centimeters.


, The Pythagorean theorem for a square with side s and diagonal d gives you the formula 2s2=d2{\displaystyle 2s^{2}=d^{2}}. Solve for d if you know the side lengths and want to find the length of the diagonal:


2s2=d2{\displaystyle 2s^{2}=d^{2}}2s2=d2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2s^{2}}}={\sqrt {d^{2}}}}s2=d{\displaystyle s{\sqrt {2}}=d}

For example, if a square has sides of 7 inches, its diagonal d = 7√2 inches, or about 9.9 inches.

If you don't have a calculator, you can use 1.4 as an estimate for √2.


, If you are given the diagonal and you know that the diagonal of a square is s2{\displaystyle s{\sqrt {2}}}, you can divide both sides by 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} to get s=d2{\displaystyle s={\frac {d}{\sqrt {2}}}}.

For example, a square with a diagonal of 10cm has sides with length 102=7.071{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{\sqrt {2}}}=7.071} cm.

If you need to find both the side length and the area from the diagonal, you can use this formula first, then quickly square the answer to get the area: Area =s2=7.0712=50{\displaystyle =s^{2}=7.071^{2}=50} square centimeters. This is a bit less accurate, since 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is an irrational number that can lead to rounding errors.


, The math checks out for the formula Area = d22{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}}{2}}}, but is there a way to test this directly? Well, d2{\displaystyle d^{2}} is the area of a second square with the diagonal as a side. Since the full formula is d22{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}}{2}}}, you can reason that this second square has exactly twice the area of the original square. You can test this yourself:

Draw a square on a piece of paper. Make sure all the sides are equal.

Measure the diagonal. Draw a second square using that measurement as the length of the square.

Trace a copy of your first square so you have two of them. Cut all three squares out.

Cut apart the two smaller squares into any shapes so you can arrange them to fit inside the large square. They should fill the space perfectly, showing that the area of the larger square is exactly twice the area of the smaller square.

Find the length of one side of the cube.,
Cube the length of the side.,
Label your answer with cubic units.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Cube2," Often, in problems asking you to find the volume of a cube, you'll be given the length of one of a cube's sides. If you have this information, you have all you need to solve for the cube's volume. If you're not solving an abstract math problem but are instead attempting to find the volume of a real-life object shaped like a cube, use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the side of the cube.


To better understand the process of finding the volume of a cube, let's follow along with an example problem as we go through the steps in this section. Let's say the side of the cube is 2 inches (5.08 cm) long. We'll use this information to find the volume of the cube in the next step.

, When you've found the length of one of the cube's sides, cube this number. In other words, multiply it by itself twice. If s is the length of the side, you would multiply s × s × s (or, in simplified form, s3). This will give you the volume of your cube!


This process is essentially the same as finding the area of the base and then multiplying it by the cube's height (or, in other words, length × width × height), since the area of the base is found by multiplying its length and its width. Since the length, width, and height of a cube are equal, we can shorten this process by simply cubing any of these measurements.
Let's proceed with our example. Since the length of the side of our cube is 2 inches, we can find the volume by multiplying 2 x 2 x 2 (or 23) = 8.

, Since volume is the measure of three-dimensional space, your answer should be in cubic units by definition. Often, on math schoolwork, neglecting to label your answer with the right units can cause you to lose points on a problem, so don't forget to use the correct label!


In our example, since our original measurement was in inches, our final answer will be labelled with the units ""cubic inches"" (or in3). So, our answer of 8 becomes 8 in3.
If we had used a different initial unit of measurement, our final cubic units would differ. For instance, if our cube had sides with lengths of 2 meters, rather than 2 inches, we would label it with cubic meters (m3).

Find your cube's surface area.,
Divide the cube's surface area by 6.,
Take the square root of this value.,
Cube this value to find the cube's volume.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Cube3," While the easiest way to find a cube's volume is to cube the length of one of its sides, it's not the only way. The length of a cube's side or the area of one of its faces can be derived from several other of the cube's properties, which means that if you start with one of these pieces of information, you can find the volume of the cube in a roundabout manner. For instance, if you know a cube's surface area, all you need to do to find its volume is to divide the surface area by 6, then take the square root of this value to find the length of the cube's sides. From here, all you'll need to do is cube the length of the side to find the volume as normal. In this section, we'll walk through this process step-by-step.


The surface area of a cube is given via the formula 6s2, where s is the length of one of the cube's sides. This formula is essentially the same as finding the 2-dimensional area of the cube's six faces and adding these values together. We'll use this formula to find the volume of the cube from its surface area.
As a running example, let's say that we have a cube whose surface we know to be 50 cm2, but we don't know its side lengths. In the next few steps, we'll use this information to find the cube's volume.

, Since the cube has 6 faces with equal area, dividing the cube's surface area by 6 will give you the area of one of its faces. This area is equal to the lengths of two of its sides multiplied (l × w, w × h, or h × l).


In our example, dividing 50/6 = 8.33 cm2. Don't forget that two-dimensional answers have square units (cm2, in2, and so on).

, Since the area of one of the cube's faces is equal to s2 (s × s), taking the square root of this value will find you the length of one of the cube's sides. Once you have this, you have enough information to solve for the volume of the cube as you normally would.


In our example, √8.33 is roughly 2.89 cm.

, Now that you've obtained a value for the length of the cube's side, simply cube this value (multiply it by itself twice) to find the volume of the cube as detailed in the section above. Congratulations - you've found the volume of a cube from its surface area.


In our example, 2.89 × 2.89 × 2.89 = 24.14 cm3. Don't forget to label your answer with cubic units.

Divide the diagonal across one of the cube's faces by √2 to find the cube's side length.,
Square the diagonal of two opposite corners of the cube, then divide by 3 and take the square root to find the side length.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Cube4," By definition, the diagonal of a perfect square is √2 × the length of one of its sides. Thus, if the only information you're given about a cube is regarding the diagonal length of one of its faces, you can find the side length for the cube by dividing this value by √2. From here, it's relatively simple to cube your answer and find the volume of the cube as described above.


For instance, let's say that one of a cube's faces has a diagonal that is 7 feet long. We would find the side length of the cube by dividing 7/√2 = 4.96 feet. Now that we know the side length, we can find the volume of the cube by multiplying 4.963 = 122.36 feet3.
Note that, in general terms, d2 = 2s2 where d is the length of the diagonal of one of the cube's faces and s is the length of one of the sides of the cube. This is because, according to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sums of the squares of the other two sides. Thus, because the diagonal of a cube's face and two of the sides on that face form a right triangle, d2 = s2 + s2 = 2s2.

, If the only piece of information you're given about a cube is the length of a 3-dimensional line segment stretching diagonally from one corner of the cube to the corner opposite it, it's still possible to find the volume of the cube. Because d forms one of the sides of a right triangle that has the diagonal between the two opposite corners of the cube as a hypotenuse, we can say that D2 = 3s2, where D = the 3-dimensional diagonal between opposite corners of the cube.


This is because of the Pythagorean Theorem. D, d, and s form a right triangle with D as the hypotenuse, so we can say that D2 = d2 + s2. Since we calculated above that d2 = 2s2, we can say that D2 = 2s2 + s2 = 3s2.
As an example, let's say that we know that the diagonal from one of the corners in the base of the cube to the opposite corner in the ""top"" of the cube is 10 m. If we want to find the volume, we would insert 10 for each ""D"" in the equation above as follows:


D2 = 3s2.
102 = 3s2.
100 = 3s2

33.33 = s2


5.77 m = s. From here, all we need to do to find the volume of the cube is to cube the side length.
5.773 = 192.45 m3

Identify the base and height of one of the triangular bases.,
Multiply them.,
Divide the result by two.,
Multiply this number by the height of the shape.",How to Calculate the Volume of a Triangular Prism," The triangular bases of the triangular prism will have the same dimensions, so it doesn't matter which triangle you use. Now, find the base and the height of the triangle by locating the length of one of the sides of the triangle as well as the length of a line perpendicular to that first line. If you're working with a right triangle, then great -- you can just take the length of the two sides.


Let's say you're working with a triangle with a height of 3 cm and a base of 4 cm.;
, This is the first step to finding the area of the base, which is in the case of the triangular prism, a triangle. So: 3 cm x 4 cm = 12 cm 2. Don't forget to state your answer in square units since you're working with area.

, To finish finding the area of the triangular base, simply divide 12 cm2 by 2. So, 12 cm2/2 = 6 cm2
, Let's say the height of the triangular prism, or the length of one of its sides, is 10 cm. So, just multiply 6 cm2 x 10 cm to find the volume of the triangular prism. 6 cm2 x 10 cm = 60 cm3. Don't forget to state your answer in cubic units since you're working with volume.


You have just followed the simple formula for finding the volume of a triangular prism: 1/2 x bh x l.

Don't forget to state your answer in square units.",How to Find the Area of a Square1," Let's say you're working with a square with a side length of 3 centimeter (1.2 in). Write it down.;
, Since all squares have equal length sides, you can just multiply the distance by itself. If the length of a side of a square is 3 centimeter (1.2 in), then you just have to square 3 centimeter (1.2 in) to find the area of a square. 3 centimeter (1.2 in) x 3 centimeter (1.2 in) = 9 cm2.

, You're done.


Squaring the side of a square is the same thing as multiplying the square's height times its base.

Multiply the perimeter by 1/4 to find the length of a side.,
Multiply the length of the side by itself.",How to Find the Area of a Square3," This is the same as dividing the perimeter by 4. Since there are four sides to a square and each side is of equal length, you can find the length of a square just by dividing the perimeter by 4. Let's say the perimeter of the square you're working with is 20 centimeter (7.9 in). Just multiply 20 centimeter (7.9 in) by 1/4: 20 centimeter (7.9 in) x 1/4 = 5 centimeter (2.0 in). You know that the length of a side of the square is 5 centimeter (2.0 in).

, Square the length of the side. Now that you know that the length of a side is 5 centimeter (2.0 in), you can square it to get the area of the square. Area = (5 cm)2 = 25 centimeter (9.8 in).2

Multiply base times height to get the area of a rectangle.,
Multiply one side by itself to find the area of a square.,
Multiply the diagonals and divide by two to find the area of a rhombus.,
Alternatively, use base × height to find the area of a rhombus.,
Be aware that the rhombus and rectangle formulas work for squares.",How to Find the Area of a Quadrilateral3," A parallelogram is any four-sided shape with two pairs of parallel sides where the sides across from each other are the same length. Parallelograms include:



Squares: Four sides, all the same length. Four corners, all 90 degrees (right angles).

Rectangles: Four sides; opposite sides have same lengths. Four corners, all 90 degrees.

Rhombuses: Four sides; opposite sides have same lengths. Four corners; none have to be 90 degrees but opposite corners must have the same angles.

, To find the area of a rectangle, you need two measurements: the width, or base (the longer side of the rectangle), and the length, or height (the shorter side of the rectangle). Then, just multiply them together to get the area. In other words:



Area = base × height, or A = b × h for short.

Example: If the base of a rectangle has a length of 10 inches and the height has a length of 5 inches, then the area of the rectangle is simply 10 × 5 (b × h) = 50 square inches.
Don't forget that when you're finding a shape's area, you will use square units (square inches, square feet, square meters, etc.) for your answer.

, Squares are basically special rectangles, so you can use the same formula to find their area. However, since a square's sides all have the same length, you can use the shortcut of just multiplying one side's length by itself. This is the same as multiplying the square's base by its height because the base and height are simply always the same. Use the following equation:Area = side × side or A = s2


Example: If one side of a square has a length of 4 feet, (t = 4), then the area of this square is simply t2, or 4 x 4 = 16 square feet.

, Be careful with this one — when you're finding the area of a rhombus, you can't simply multiply two adjacent sides. Instead, find the diagonals (the lines connecting each set of opposite corners), multiply them, and divide by two. In other words: Area = (Diag. 1 × Diag. 2)/2 or A = (d1 × d2)/2


Example: If a rhombus has diagonals with a length of 6 meters and 8 meters, then its area is simply (6 × 8)/2 = 48/2 = 24 square meters.

, Technically, you can also use the base times height formula to find the area of a rhombus. Here, ""base"" and ""height"" don't mean you can just multiply two adjacent sides, however. First, pick one side to be the base. Then, draw a line from the base to the opposite side. The line should meet both sides at 90 degrees. The length of this side is what you should use for height.



Example: A rhombus has sides of 10 miles and 5 miles. The straight-line distance between the 10 mile (16.1 km) sides is 3 miles (4.8 km). If you want to find the area of the rhombus, you would multiply 10 × 3 = 30 square miles.

, The side × side formula given above for squares is by far the most convenient way to find the area for these shapes. However, because squares are technically both rectangles and rhombuses as well as squares, you can use those shapes' area formulas for squares and get the correct answer. In other words, for squares:



Area = base × height or A = b × h


Area = (Diag. 1 × Diag. 2)/2 or A = (d1 × d2)/2


Example: A four-sided shape has two adjacent sides with lengths of 4 meters. You can find the area of this square by multiplying its base times its height: 4 × 4 = 16 square meters.

Example: A square's diagonals are both equal to 10 centimeters. You can find this square's area with the diagonal formula: (10 × 10)/2 = 100/2 = 50 square centimeters.

Know how to identify a trapezoid.,
Find the height of the trapezoid.,
Find the area of the trapezoid using the height and the length of the bases.,
Multiply the midsegment by two to find the area of a trapezoid.",How to Find the Area of a Quadrilateral4," A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least two sides that run parallel to each other. Its corners can have any angles. Each of the four sides on a trapezoid can be a different length.


There are two different ways you can find the area of a trapezoid, depending on which pieces of information you have. Below, you'll see how to use both.

, The height of a trapezoid is the perpendicular line connecting the two parallel sides. This will not usually be the same length as one of the sides, because the sides are usually pointed diagonally. You will need this for both area equations. Here's how to find the height of a trapezoid:Find the shorter of the two base lines (the parallel sides). Place your pencil at the corner between that baseline and one of the non-parallel sides. Draw a straight line that meets the two base lines at right angles. Measure this line to find the height.
You can also sometimes use trigonometry to determine the height if the height line, the base, and the other side make a right triangle. See our trig article for more information.

, If you know the height of the trapezoid as well as the length of both bases, use the following equation:



Area = (Base 1 + Base 2)/2 × height or A = (a+b)/2 × h


Example: If you have a trapezoid with one base of 7 yards, another base of 11 yards, and the height line connecting them is 2 yards long, you can find its area like this: (7 + 11)/2 × 2 = (18)/2 × 2 = 9 × 2 = 18 square yards.
If the height is 10 and the bases have the lengths of 7 and 9, then you can find the area simply by doing the following: (7 + 9)/2 * 10 = (16/2) * 10 = 8 * 10 = 80

, The midsegment is an imaginary line that runs parallel to the bottom and top lines of the trapezoid and is exactly the same distance from each. Since the midsegment is always equal to (Base 1 + Base 2)/2, if you know it, you can use a shortcut for the trapezoid formula:



Area = midsegment × height or A = m × h

Essentially, this is the same as using the original formula except that you're using ""m"" instead of (a + b)/2.
'Example:' The midsegment of the trapezoid in the example above is 9 yards long. This means we can find the area of the trapezoid simply by multiplying 9 × 2 = 18 square yards, just like before.

Start with the side length and apothem.,
Divide the pentagon into five triangles.,
Calculate the area of a triangle.,
Multiply by five to find the total area.",How to Find the Area of a Pentagon1," This method works for regular pentagons, with five equal sides. Besides the side length, you'll need the ""apothem"" of the pentagon. The apothem is the line from the center of the pentagon to a side, intersecting the side at a 90º right angle.


Don't confuse the apothem with the radius, which touches a corner (vertex) instead of a midpoint. If you only know the side length and radius, skip down to the next method instead.
We'll use an example pentagon with side length 3 units and apothem 2 units.;
, Draw five lines from the center of the pentagon, leading to each vertex (corner). You now have five triangles.

, Each triangle has a base equal to the side of the pentagon. It also has a height equal to the pentagon's apothem. (Remember, the height of a triangle runs from a vertex to the opposite side, at a right angle.) To find the area of any triangle, just calculate ½ x base x height.


In our example, area of triangle = ½ x 3 x 2 = 3 square units.

, We've divided the pentagon into five equal triangles. To find the total area, just multiply the area of one triangle by five.


In our example, A(total pentagon) = 5 x A(triangle) = 5 x 3 = 15 square units.

Know how to identify a kite.,
Use the rhombus diagonal formula to find the area of a kite.,
Use the lengths of the sides and the angle between them to find the area.",How to Find the Area of a Quadrilateral5," A kite is a four-sided shape with two pairs of equal-length sides that are adjacent to each other, not opposite each other. Like their name suggests, kites resemble real-life kites.


There are two different ways to find the area of a kite depending on which pieces of information you have. Below you will find how to use both.

, Since a rhombus is just a special kind of kite where the sides are the same length, you can use the diagonal rhombus area formula to find a kite's area as well. As a reminder, diagonals are the straight lines between two opposite corners on the kite. Like a rhombus, the kite area formula is:



Area = (Diag. 1 × Diag 2.)/2 or A = (d1 × d2)/2


Example: If a kite has diagonals with lengths of 19 meters and 5 meters, then its area is simply (19 × 5)/2 = 95/2 = 47.5 square meters.
If you don't know the lengths of the diagonals and can't measure them, you can use trigonometry to calculate them. See our kite article for more information.

, If you know the two different values for the lengths of the sides and the angle at the corner between those sides, you can solve for the area of the kite with the principles of trigonometry.This method requires you to know how to do sine functions (or at least to have a calculator with a sine function). See our trig article for more information or use the formula below:



Area = (Side 1 × Side 2) × sin (angle) or A = (s1 × s2) × sin(θ) (where θ is the angle between sides 1 and 2).

Example: You have a kite with two sides of length 6 feet and two sides of length 4 feet. The angle between them is about 120 degrees. In this case, you can solve for the area like this: (6 × 4) × sin(120) = 24 × 0.866 = 20.78 square feet

Note that you need to use the two different sides and the angle between them here — using the set of sides with the same length won't work.

Find the lengths of all four sides.,
Find the angles between a and d and b and c. When you're working with an irregular quadrilateral, you can't find the area from the sides alone.,
Use the triangle area formula to find the area of the quadrilateral.",How to Find the Area of a Quadrilateral6," Does your quadrilateral not fall into any of the tidy categories above (for instance, does it have sides with all different lengths and zero parallel sets of sides?) Believe it or not, there are formulas you can use to figure out the area of any quadrilateral, regardless of its shape. In this section, you will find how to use the most common one. Note that this formula requires knowledge of trigonometry (once again, here is our basic trig guide.


First, you must find lengths of each of the quadrilateral's four sides. For the purposes of this article, we will label them a, b, c and d. Sides a and c are opposite from each other and sides b and d are opposite each other.

Example: If you have an oddly-shaped quadrilateral that doesn't fit in any of the categories above, first, measure its four sides. Let's say that they have lengths of 12, 9, 5, and 14 inches. In the steps below, you'll use this information to find the shape's area.

, Continue by finding two of the opposite angles. For the purposes of this section, we'll use angle A between sides a and d, and angle C between sides b and c. However, you can also do this with the two other opposite angles.



Example: Let's say that in your quadrilateral, A is equal to 80 degrees and C is equal to 110 degrees. In the next step, you'll use these values to find the total area.

, Imagine that there is a straight line from the corner between a and b to the corner between c and d. This line would split the quadrilateral into two triangles. Since the area of a triangle is absinC, where C is the angle between sides a and b, you can use this formula twice (once for each of your imaginary triangles) to get the total area of the quadrilateral. In other words, for any quadrilateral:



Area = 0.5 Side 1 × Side 4 × sin(Side 1&4 angle) + 0.5 × Side 2 × Side 3 × sin (Side 2&3 angle) or
Area = 0.5 a × d × sin A + 0.5 × b × c × sin C

Example: You already have the sides and angles you need, so let's solve:



= 0.5 (12 × 14) × sin (80) + 0.5 × (9 × 5) × sin (110)
= 84 × sin (80) + 22.5 × sin (110)
= 84 × 0.984 + 22.5 × 0.939
= 82.66 + 21.13 = 103.79 square inches





Note that if you're trying to find the area of a parallelogram, in which the opposite angles are equal, the equation reduces to Area = 0.5*(ad + bc) * sin A.

Start with just the side length.,
Divide the pentagon into five triangles.,
Divide a triangle in half.,
Label one of the smaller triangles.,
Calculate the height of the triangle.,
Find the area of the triangle.,
Multiply to find the area of the pentagon.",How to Find the Area of a Pentagon2," This method only works for regular pentagons, which have five sides of equal length.


In this example, we'll use a pentagon with side length 7 units.

, Draw a line from the center of the pentagon to any vertex. Repeat this for every vertex. You now have five triangles, each the same size.

, Draw a line from the center of the pentagon to the base of one triangle. This line should hit the base at a 90º right angle, dividing the triangle into two equal, smaller triangles.

, We can already label one sides and one angle of the smaller triangle:


The base of the triangle is ½ the side of the pentagon. In our example, this is ½ x 7 = 3.5 units.
The angle at the pentagon's center is always 36º.(Starting with a full 360º center, you could divide it into 10 of these smaller triangles. 360 ÷ 10 = 36, so the angle at one triangle is 36º.)

, The height of this triangle is the side at right angles to the pentagon's edge, leading to the center. We can use beginning trigonometry to find the length of this side:In a right-angle triangle, the tangent of an angle equals the length of the opposite side, divided by the length of the adjacent side.
The side opposite the 36º angle is the base of the triangle (half the pentagon's side). The side adjacent to the 36º angle is the height of the triangle.
tan(36º) = opposite / adjacent
In our example, tan(36º) = 3.5 / height
height x tan(36º) = 3.5
height = 3.5 / tan(36º)
height = (about) 4.8 units.

, A triangle's area equals ½ the base x the height. (A = ½bh.) Now that you know the height, plug in these values to find the height of your small triangle.


In our example, Area of small triangle = ½bh = ½(3.5)(4.8) = 8.4 square units.

, One of these smaller triangles covers 1/10 of the pentagon's area. To find the total area, multiply the area of the smaller triangle by 10.


In our example, the area of the whole pentagon = 8.4 x 10 = 84 square units.

Area of a regular pentagon = pa/2, where p = the perimeter and a = the apothem.If you don't know the perimeter, calculate it from the side length: p = 5s, where s is the side length.

, If you only know the side length, use the following formula:Area of a regular pentagon = (5s2) / (4tan(36º)), where s = side length.
tan(36º) = √(5-2√5).So if your calculator doesn't have a ""tan"" function, use the formula Area = (5s2) / (4√(5-2√5)).

, You can even find the area if you only know the radius. Use this formula:Area of a regular pentagon = (5/2)r2sin(72º), where r is the radius.

Let the diagonal = c^2 and let the height and width of the rectangle = a^2 and b^2, respectively.
,
Let the diagonal = 225, and let its square = 60,025; you know that a Pythagorean Triple is 3-4-5. with the hypotenuse equal  to 5, so now you want to know how to get the other sides, given that information.,
Reason the answer is going to be =(3*x^2)^2+(4*x^2)^2, or 3^2x^4 +4^2x^4.,
Try 7 because 60,025/5^2=7^4=2401:   7^4 *9 + 7^4 *16 = 60,025 -- the square of the diagonal!,
Learn that the shorter side is sqrt(3* 7^2)^2 = 147, and the longer side is sqrt(4 * 7^2)^2 = 196.,
Deduce that the area of the rectangle then is 196 * 147 = 28,812

You are warned, however, that this method works because many Pythagorean Triples are related to the 3-4-5 triple, but not all.",How to Find the Area of a Rectangle Using the Diagonal1,",, Since 3 and 4 are close to each other, try a number between 3^2 and 4^2, like 12.5 and various x's to the 4th power. Try 6. 6^4 * 12.5 = 16,228.512 which is not bad, considering we averaged, but it's low., You did it! 3^2 = 9 and 4^2 = 16 and x^4 = 7^4., 147^2 + 196^2 = 60,025 = c^2. Its square root is 225, the diagonal., However, there are various other triples, since all that is required of the triangle is that it have a 90 degree angle in it.
Still, with diligence, one may discover the given relation for a given rectangle by close observation of how long and thin it is.
Direct relative measurement of the sides of the rectangle also helps in finding its area, but error can creep in with direct measurement so formulation is needed to provide a more exact answer, typically.

Set up the formula for finding the surface area of a prism.,
Plug the lateral area into the formula.,
Plug the area of one base into the formula.,
Complete the calculations.",How to Find Surface Area of a Triangular Prism," The formula is L=Ph{\displaystyle L=Ph}, where L{\displaystyle L} equals the lateral area of the prism, P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter of one base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the prism.The lateral area of a prism is the surface area of all sides, or faces, that are not the base.;
, The base is a triangle, so it will have three sides. The area of the perimeter of a triangle is Perimeter=a+b+c{\displaystyle {\text{Perimeter}}=a+b+c}, where a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c} are the length of each side of the triangle.It doesn’t matter which base you use to calculate, because the two bases of a prism are congruent.For example, if the base has three sides measuring 6 cm, 5 cm, and 4 cm, to calculate the perimeter, you would add up all three sides: 6+5+4=15{\displaystyle 6+5+4=15}. So, the perimeter of one base is 15 cm.


, Make sure you substitute for the variable P{\displaystyle P} in the formula.

For example, L=15h{\displaystyle L=15h}.


, The height of the prism is the same as the length of the side of any lateral face that is not connected to the base. Usually (but not always) this will be the longer side of the lateral face.

For example, if the height of the prism is 9 cm, your formula will look like this: L=15(9){\displaystyle L=15(9)}.


, The result will give you, in square units, the lateral surface area of the prism. This is the first value you need to find the total surface area of the prism, so set this value aside while you calculate the area of the base.

For example, 15(9)=135{\displaystyle 15(9)=135}, So, the lateral surface area of the prism is 135 square centimeters.


, Since the bases of a triangular prism are triangles, you will use this formula to calculate their area. The formula for the area of a triangle is A=12bh{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}bh}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the triangle, b{\displaystyle b} equals the base of the triangle, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the triangle.This is the most common way to calculate the area of a triangle. If you don’t know the height of the triangle, you can also  calculate the area using the length of the triangle’s three sides.

You only need to find the area of one base, since the two bases of a prism are congruent, and will therefore have the same area., Don’t confuse the base for another side of the triangle. The base is the side perpendicular to the height.

For example, if the base of the triangle is 6 cm, your formula will look like this: A=126h{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}6h}.


, Multiply the base by the height. Then, take half of this value. This will give you the area of the base, in square units. This is the second value you need to calculate the total surface area of the prism.

For example, if the height is 3.3 cm, then your calculations will look like this: A=126(3.3){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}6(3.3)}A=3(3.3){\displaystyle A=3(3.3)}A=9.9{\displaystyle A=9.9}So, the area of the base is 9.9 square centimeters.


, The formula is SA=L+2B{\displaystyle SA=L+2B}, where SA{\displaystyle SA} equals the surface area of the prism, L{\displaystyle L} equals the lateral area of the prism, and B{\displaystyle B} equals the area of one base., This is the surface area of all sides of the prism that are not the base. You should have calculated this previously. Make sure that you substitute the lateral area for the variable L{\displaystyle L}.

For example, if the lateral area of your triangular prism is 135 square centimeters, your formula will look like this: SA=135+2B{\displaystyle SA=135+2B}.


, Make sure you use the area of just one base, not the total area of both bases combined. Substitute the base area for the variable B{\displaystyle B}.

For example, if the area of one base of your prism is 9.9 square centimeters, your formula will look like this: SA=135+2(9.9){\displaystyle SA=135+2(9.9)}.


, Multiply the area of the base by 2, then add the lateral area. This will give you the total surface area, in square units, of your triangular prism.

For example:SA=135+2(9.9){\displaystyle SA=135+2(9.9)}SA=135+19.8{\displaystyle SA=135+19.8}SA=154.8{\displaystyle SA=154.8}So, the surface area of a triangular prism with a base having sides measuring 6, 5, and 4 centimeters in length, and a height measuring 9 centimeters in length, has a surface area of 154.8 square centimeters.

If the rectangular form is given and it is not close to a square, proportion it with a ruler, and make adjustments accordingly.

Set up the formula for the area of a kite, given two diagonals.,
Plug the lengths of the diagonals into the formula.,
Multiply the lengths of the diagonals.,
Divide the product of the diagonals by 2.",How to Find the Area of a Kite1," The formula is A=xy2{\displaystyle A={\frac {xy}{2}}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the kite, and x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} equal the lengths of the diagonals of the kite., A diagonal is a straight line that runs from one vertex to the vertex on the opposite side.You should either be given the length of the diagonals, or be able to measure them. If you don’t know the length of the diagonals, you cannot use this method.

For example, if a kite has two diagonals measuring 7 inches and 10 inches, your formula will look like this:A=7×102{\displaystyle A={\frac {7\times 10}{2}}}.


, The product becomes the new numerator in the area equation.

For example:A=7×102{\displaystyle A={\frac {7\times 10}{2}}}A=702{\displaystyle A={\frac {70}{2}}}


, This will give you the area of the kite, in square units.

For example:A=702{\displaystyle A={\frac {70}{2}}}A=35{\displaystyle A=35}So, the area of a kite with diagonals measuring 10 inches and 7 inches is 35 square inches.

Find the sine of the angle.,
Multiply the product of the sides by the sine of the angle.",How to Find the Area of a Kite2," This formula works if you are given two non-congruent side lengths and the size of the angle between those two sides. The formula is A=absin⁡C{\displaystyle A=ab\sin C}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the kite, a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the non-congruent side lengths of the kite, and C{\displaystyle C} equals the size of the angle between sides a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.Make sure you are using two non-congruent side lengths. A kite has two pairs of congruent sides. You need to use one side from each pair. Make sure the angle measurement you use is the angle between these two sides. If you do not have all of this information, you cannot use this method.


, This information should be given, or you should be able to measure them. Remember that you are using non-congruent sides, so each side should have a different length.

For example, if your kite has a side length of 20 inches and a side length of 15 inches, your formula will look like this: A=20×15sin⁡C{\displaystyle A=20\times 15\sin C}.


, Plug this product into the formula.

For example:A=20×15sin⁡C{\displaystyle A=20\times 15\sin C}A=300sin⁡C{\displaystyle A=300\sin C}


, Make sure you are using the angle between the two non-congruent sides.

For example, if the angle measurement is 150∘{\displaystyle 150^{\circ }}, your formula will look like this: A=300sin⁡(150){\displaystyle A=300\sin(150)}.


, To do this, you can use a calculator, or use a trigonometry chart.For example, the sine of a 150 degree angle is .5, so your formula will look like this: A=300(.5){\displaystyle A=300(.5)}.


, This result will be the area of the kite, in square units.

For example:A=300(.5){\displaystyle A=300(.5)}A=150{\displaystyle A=150}So, the area of a kite, with two sides measuring 20 inches and 15 inches, and the angle between them measuring 150 degrees, is 150 square inches.

Make sure you are substituting for A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if your kite has an area of 35 square inches, your formula will look like this: 35=xy2{\displaystyle 35={\frac {xy}{2}}}.


, Substitute for x{\displaystyle x}.

For example, if you know one of the diagonals is 7 inches long, your formula will look like this: 35=7y2{\displaystyle 35={\frac {7y}{2}}}.


, This will remove the fraction in the formula.

For example:35=7y2{\displaystyle 35={\frac {7y}{2}}}35×2=7y2×2{\displaystyle 35\times 2={\frac {7y}{2}}\times 2}70=7y{\displaystyle 70=7y}


, This will give you the length of the missing diagonal.

For example:70=7y{\displaystyle 70=7y}707=7y7{\displaystyle {\frac {70}{7}}={\frac {7y}{7}}}10=y{\displaystyle 10=y}So, the length of the missing diagonal of a kite, given an area of 35 square inches and one diagonal of 7 inches, is 10 inches.

Set one point of your compass on point A{\displaystyle A}, and open your compass so the pencil is on point B{\displaystyle B}. Fix your compass so this measurement is set.Some compasses are more flexible than others. When you set this length, you need to be sure that the compass does not move as you transfer to your new figure. There may be a screw to tighten or a clip to adjust to set this length.
;
, At a new position on your paper, wherever you wish to draw the new triangle, mark a point and label it A1{\displaystyle A_{1}}. Set the point of your compass on A1{\displaystyle A_{1}}. Mark a point with the compass pencil at the designated length. Label this point B1{\displaystyle B_{1}}., Use your straightedge to connect points A1{\displaystyle A_{1}} and B1{\displaystyle B_{1}}. This line should be an exact copy of side AB¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}} from the original triangle. If segment A1B1¯{\displaystyle {\overline {A_{1}B_{1}}}} does not look like it is the same length as original side AB¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}}, then your compass probably slipped while you were moving it. Start over and try again.


, To begin copying the angle, set your compass to any reasonable size. Choose a setting that is roughly half the length of the sides of your original triangle. , Set the point of your compass on point A{\displaystyle A} of the original triangle. Swing the compass so it draws an arc that intersects both sides AB¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}} and AC¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AC}}}.Mark the two positions where the arc intersects the triangle sides. Label the intersection with side AB¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AB}}} as x{\displaystyle x} and label the intersection with side AC¯{\displaystyle {\overline {AC}}} as y{\displaystyle y}.


, Without letting the compass setting change, place the point of the compass on A1{\displaystyle A_{1}} of your construction.

In the above example, the length is 5 cm and the width is 2 cm.

, Using the length and width you just measured, plug them into the formula to solve for the perimeter. There are two ways to solve the equation depending on which formula you have used. For P = 2(l +w) , add the length and the width together and multiply by 2. For P = 2l + 2w, multiply the length by 2 and the width by 2, then add these products together.


For example, P = 2(l + w) = 2(2 + 5) = 2(7) = 14 cm.
For example, P = 2l + 2w = (2 x 2) + (2 x 5) = 4 + 10 = 14 cm.

For example, if you know the radius of a circle is 25 centimeter (9.8 in), your formula will look like this: 25=2π(r){\displaystyle 25=2\pi (r)}.


, This will cancel the coefficient of 2 on the right side of the equation, leaving you with π(r){\displaystyle \pi (r)}.

For example:25=2π(r){\displaystyle 25=2\pi (r)}252=2π(r)2{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{2}}={\frac {2\pi (r)}{2}}}12.5=π(r){\displaystyle 12.5=\pi (r)}


, This is the generally accepted rounded value of π{\displaystyle \pi }. You can also use the π{\displaystyle \pi } function on a scientific calculator for a more exact result. Dividing by π{\displaystyle \pi } isolates the radius, giving you its value.

For example:12.5=π(r){\displaystyle 12.5=\pi (r)}12.5π=π(r)π{\displaystyle {\frac {12.5}{\pi }}={\frac {\pi (r)}{\pi }}}3.98=r{\displaystyle 3.98=r}


, The formula is area=π(r2){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (r^{2})}, where r{\displaystyle r} equals the radius of the circle.Don’t confuse the formula for area with the formula for circumference, which you previously used to calculate the radius.
, Substitute the value you previously calculated and substitute it for the variable r{\displaystyle r}. Then, square the value. To square a value means to multiply it by itself. It’s easy to do this using the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} button on a scientific calculator.

For example, if you found the radius to be 3.98, you would calculate:area=π(r2){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (r^{2})}area=π(3.982){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (3.98^{2})}area=π(15.8404){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (15.8404)}


, If you are not using a calculator, you can use the rounded value 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }. The product will give you the area of the circle, in square units.

For example:area=π(15.8404){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (15.8404)}area=π(49.764){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (49.764)}So, the area of a circle with a circumference of 25 centimeter (9.8 in) is about 49.764 square centimeters.


, The formula is circumference=2π(A){\displaystyle {\text{circumference}}=2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the circle. This formula is derived by rearranging the value of r{\displaystyle r} in the formula for the area of a circle (area=π(r2){\displaystyle {\text{area}}=\pi (r^{2})}) and substituting that value into the circumference formula (circumference=2π(r){\displaystyle {\text{circumference}}=2\pi (r)})., This information should be given to you. Make sure you substitute the circumference on the left side of the formula, not for the value of A{\displaystyle A} on the right side.

For example, if you know the circumference is 25 centimeter (9.8 in), your formula will look like this: 25=2π(A){\displaystyle 25=2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}.


, Remember that what you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side as well. Dividing by 2 simplifies the right side to π(A){\displaystyle {\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}.

For example:25=2π(A){\displaystyle 25=2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}252=2π(A)2{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{2}}={\frac {2{\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}{2}}}12.5=π(A){\displaystyle 12.5={\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}


, When you square a value, you multiply the value by itself. Squaring a square root cancels the square root, leaving you with the value under the radical sign. Remember to keep the equation balanced by squaring both sides.

For example:12.5=π(A){\displaystyle 12.5={\sqrt {\pi (A)}}}12.52=(π(A))2{\displaystyle 12.5^{2}=({\sqrt {\pi (A)}})^{2}}156.25=π(A){\displaystyle 156.25=\pi (A)}


, If you have a scientific calculator, you can use the π{\displaystyle \pi } function instead to get a more accurate answer. This will cancel out π{\displaystyle \pi } on the right side of the equation, leaving you with the value of A{\displaystyle A}. This is the area of the circle, in square units.

For example:156.25=π(A){\displaystyle 156.25=\pi (A)}156.25π=π(A)π{\displaystyle {\frac {156.25}{\pi }}={\frac {\pi (A)}{\pi }}}49.7359=A{\displaystyle 49.7359=A}So, the area of a circle with a circumference of 25 centimeter (9.8 in) is about 49.74 square centimeters.

Recall the formula for slope.,
Read the components of the given vector.,
Calculate the slope.,
Recall the geometric definition of perpendicular slopes.,
Identify the reciprocal of the vector slope.,
Find the negative reciprocal.,
Write the new vector in component form.",How to Find Perpendicular Vectors in 2 Dimensions," The slope of any given line or line segment is calculated by dividing the vertical change (or the “rise”) by the horizontal change (the “run”). This can be expressed more symbolically as follows:slope=ΔxΔy{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}={\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta y}}}
;
, A vector can be written in component form as (i,j){\displaystyle (i,j)}. In this form, the first coefficient i{\displaystyle i} represents the horizontal component of the vector, or the Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x}. The second coefficient j{\displaystyle j} represents the vertical component of the vector, or the Δy{\displaystyle \Delta y}.For this article, we assume that you are given the vector in its component form. If, instead, you have the vector in angle-magnitude form, you will need to calculate the components first. For help with that, see Resolve a Vector Into Components.


, To find the slope, fill in the vector components into the formula for the slope. Specifically, you will divide the j{\displaystyle j} component by the i{\displaystyle i} component.For example, suppose you have a vector represented as (3,5){\displaystyle (3,5)}. This means that the horizontal change is 3{\displaystyle 3}, and the vertical change is 5{\displaystyle 5}. Find the slope:


slope=ΔxΔy{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}={\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta y}}}


slope=53{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}={\frac {5}{3}}}



You could convert this result to a decimal, which would be 1.6. However, leaving it in fraction form will actually be easier for finding the perpendicular slope.


, Two lines (including lines, line segments, or vectors) are perpendicular to each other if their slopes are negative reciprocals.Recall that a reciprocal is the multiplicative inverse of a given number. For a fraction, this can mean just “flipping” the fraction upside down. The following are examples of some numbers and their reciprocals:


5{\displaystyle 5} is the reciprocal of 15{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{5}}}.


23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}} is the reciprocal of 32{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}}.


1{\displaystyle 1} is the reciprocal of 1{\displaystyle 1}.




, After you have calculated the slope of your vector, find the reciprocal of that slope.Using the example that was started above, the vector with components (3,5){\displaystyle (3,5)} has a slope of 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}}.

The reciprocal of 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}} is 35{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{5}}}.


, If the slope of the original vector is positive, then the slope of the perpendicular vector will have to be negative. Conversely, if the slope of the original vector is negative, then the slope of the perpendicular vector will be positive.In the working example, the original slope was 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}}, so the slope of the perpendicular vector must be −35{\displaystyle -{\frac {3}{5}}}.


, Knowing the slope is almost the final step. You then need just to rewrite the vector in its component form, using the “rise” and “run” components.For the working example, the new vector will be (5,−3){\displaystyle (5,-3)}.

Look up the mass of each isotope.,
Write down the abundance of each isotope.,
Turn your abundance percentages into decimals.,
Find the weighted average of the masses.,
Convert mass to number of atoms.,
Convert to molar mass.,
Find average molecular mass.",How to Find Average Atomic Mass," Most elements can naturally occur in multiple forms, or isotopes. The only difference between two isotopes of the same element is the number of neutrons per atom, which affects the atom's mass.The average atomic mass of the element takes these variations into account, and tells you the average mass per atom in a typical sample of that element.


For example, the element silver (Ag) has two naturally occurring isotopes: Ag-107 and Ag-109 (or 107Ag and 109Ag).Isotopes are named after the ""mass number,"" or the sum of protons and neutrons in one atom.This means Ag-109 has two more neutrons per atom than Ag-107, giving it slightly more mass.;
, You'll need two pieces of information for each isotope, which you can look up in a reference book or an online source such as webelements.com. The first is the atomic mass, or the mass of one atom of each isotope. Isotopes with more neutrons have more mass.


For example, the silver isotope Ag-107 has an atomic mass of 106.90509 amu (atomic mass units). The isotope Ag-109 is slightly heavier with a mass of 108.90470.
The last couple decimal places might be slightly different in different sources. Don't include any numbers in parentheses after the mass.

, The abundance tells you how common the isotope is, as a percentage of all atoms of the element. You can find this in the same source you found the mass. The abundances of all isotopes should add up to 100% (though it might be slightly off due to rounding errors).


The isotope Ag-107 has an abundance of 51.86%. Ag-109 is slightly less common with an abundance of 48.14%. This means that a typical sample of silver is 51.86% Ag-107 and 48.14% Ag-109.
Ignore any isotopes that do not have an abundance listed. These isotopes do not occur naturally on Earth.

, Divide the abundance percentage by 100 to get the same value as a decimal.


In the sample problem, the abundance figures are 51.86 / 100 = 0.5186 and 48.14 / 100 = 0.4814.

, The average atomic mass of an element with n isotopes equals (massisotope 1 * abundanceisotope 1) + (massisotope 2 * abundanceisotope 2) + ... + (massisotope n * abundanceisotope n.This is an example of a ""weighted average,"" meaning that more common (more abundant) masses have a greater effect on the result. Here's how to use this formula for silver:


Average atomic massAg = (massAg-107 * abundanceAg-107) + (massAg-109 * abundanceAg-109)
=(106.90509 * 0.5186) + (108.90470 * 0.4814)
= 55.4410 + 52.4267
= 107.8677 amu.
Look up the element on a periodic table to check your answer. The average atomic mass is usually written underneath the element symbol., The average atomic mass tells you the relationship between mass and number of atoms in a typical sample of the element. This is useful in chemistry laboratories because it is almost impossible to count the number of atoms directly, but easy to measure mass. For example, you can weigh a sample of silver and predict that each 107.8677 amu of mass contains one silver atom.

, Atomic mass units are very small, so chemists typically weigh samples in grams instead. Fortunately, these concepts are defined to make the conversion as easy as possible. Just multiply the average atomic mass by 1 g / mol (the molar mass constant) to get an answer in g / mol instead. For example, 107.8677 grams of silver contain one mole of silver atoms on average.

, Since a molecule is just a collection of atoms, you can add the masses of the atoms together to find the mass of the molecule. If you use the average atomic masses (instead of the mass of a specific isotope), the answer is the average mass of the molecule as found in a naturally occurring sample. Here's an example:


A molecule of water has the chemical formula H2O, so it contains two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom.
Hydrogen has an average atomic mass of 1.00794 amu. Oxygen atoms have an average mass of 15.9994 amu.
The average mass of a molecule of H2O equals (1.00794)(2) + 15.9994 = 18.01528 amu, equivalent to 18.01528 g/mol.

, These two lines are the median of each side. A vertex is the point at which two sides of a triangle meet.


, This point is the triangle’s center of gravity, also called the centroid, or center of mass.

, Make sure the measurement is exact.

For example, you might have a median that is 3.6 cm long.


, To do this, divide the length by three. Again, make an exact calculation. If you round, you will not find the center of gravity.

For example, if your median is 3.6 cm long, you would divide 3.6 by 3:3.6cm/3=1.2cm{\displaystyle 3.6cm/3=1.2cm}, so ⅓ of the median is 1.2 cm.


, This point is the triangle's centroid, which will always divide a median into a 2:1 ratio; that is, the centroid is ⅓ the median’s distance from the midpoint, and ⅔ the median’s distance from the vertex.For example, on a median that is 3.6 cm long, the centroid will be 1.2 cm up from the midpoint.

For example, you might be given triangle PQR, and you need to find and label point P (3, 5), point Q (4, 1), and R (1, 0).


, Remember to add all three coordinates. You will not calculate the correct center of gravity if you only use two coordinates.

For example, if your three x-coordinates are 3, 4, and 1, add these three values together: 3+4+1=8{\displaystyle 3+4+1=8}. 


, Remember to add all three coordinates.

For example, if your three y-coordinates are 5, 1, and 0, add these three values together: 5+1+0=6{\displaystyle 5+1+0=6}.


, These coordinates will correspond to the triangle’s center of gravity, also known as the centroid or center of mass.To find the average, divide the sum of the coordinates by 3.

For example, if the sum of your x-coordinates is 8, the average x-coordinate is 8/3{\displaystyle 8/3}. If the sum of your y-coordinates is 6, the average y-coordinate is 6/3{\displaystyle 6/3}, or 2{\displaystyle 2}.

Think of the area of a circle.,
Picture a circle being squashed.",How to Calculate the Area of an Ellipse," This is the distance from the center of the ellipse to the farthest edge of the ellipse. Think of this as the radius of the ""fat"" part of the ellipse. Measure it or find it labeled in your diagram. We'll call this value a.


You can call this the ""semi-major axis"" instead.;
, As you might have guessed, the minor radius measures the distance from the center to the closest point on the edge. Call this measurement b.


This is at a 90º right angle to the major radius, but you don't need to measure any angles to solve this problem.
You can call this the ""semi-minor axis.""

, The area of the ellipse is a x b x π. Since you're multiplying two units of length together, your answer will be in units squared.


For example, if an ellipse has a major radius of 5 units and a minor radius of 3 units, the area of the ellipse is 3 x 5 x π, or about 47 square units.
If you don't have a calculator, or if your calculator doesn't have a π symbol, use ""3.14"" instead.

, You might remember that the area of a circle equals πr2, which is the same as π x r x r. What if we tried to find the area of a circle as though it were an ellipse? We would measure the radius in one direction: r. Measure it at right angles: also r. Plug it into the ellipse area formula: π x r x r! As it turns out, a circle is just a specific type of ellipse., Imagine a circle being squeezed into an ellipse shape. As it's squeezed more and more, one radius gets shorter and the other gets longer. The area stays the same, since nothing's leaving the circle.As long as we use both radii in our equation, the ""squashing"" and the ""flattening"" will cancel each other out, and we'll still have the right answer.

Set up the formula A=(θ360)πr2{\displaystyle A=\left({\frac {\theta }{360}}\right)\pi r^{2}}.,
Plug the sector’s central angle measurement into the formula.,
Plug the radius measurement into the formula.,
Multiply the two numbers together.",How to Calculate the Area of a Sector1," In the formula, r = the length of the radius, and θ = the degrees in the central angle of the sector.

Remember, the area of a circle is πr2{\displaystyle \pi r^{2}}. When finding the area of a sector, you are really just calculating the area of the whole circle, and then multiplying by the fraction of the circle the sector represents.A circle is 360 degrees, so when you place the measurement of the sector’s central angle over 360, it gives you the fraction of the whole circle.
;
, Divide the central angle by 360. Doing this will give you what fraction or percent of the entire circle the sector represents.

For example, if the central angle is 100 degrees, you will divide 100 by 360, to get 0.28. (The area of the sector is about 28 percent of the area of the whole circle.)

If you don't know the measurement of the central angle, but you know what fraction of the circle the sector is, determine the measurement of the angle by multiplying that fraction by 360. For example, if you know the sector is one-fourth of the circle, multiply 360 by one-fourth (.25) to get 90 degrees. 


, Square the radius, and multiply it by 𝝅 (3.14). Doing this will allow you to calculate the area of the whole circle.

For example, if the radius is 5 cm, you will square 5 to get 25, and then multiply 25 by 3.14, to get 78.5.

If you don't know the length of the radius, but you know the diameter, simply divide the diameter by 2 to find the radius.


, Again, you will be multiplying the percent by the area of the whole circle. This gives you the area of the sector.

For example, 0.28 x 78.5 = 21.89. 

Since you are finding the area, the answer will be in square centimeters.

, The height of the trapezoid is perpendicular to the bases. In this example, the height of the trapezoid is 7 cm.

, The sum of the lengths of the bases is 21 cm and the height is 7 cm. 21 cm x 7 cm = 147 cm2.

, Divide 147 cm2 by 2 to get the final answer. 147 cm2/2 = 73.5 cm2. The area of the trapezoid is 73.5. You have just followed the formula for finding the area of a trapezoid, which is /2.

Remember the formula for finding the circumference (perimeter) of a circle is 2𝝅r. If you know the length of the arc (which is a portion of the circumference), you can find what fraction of the circle the sector represents by comparing the arc length to the total circumference.

The complete formula would be A=(l2πr)πr2{\displaystyle A=\left({\frac {l}{2\pi r}}\right)\pi r^{2}}, but you can simplify it to A=rl2{\displaystyle A={\frac {rl}{2}}}., You will be multiplying these two numbers to get a new numerator.

For example, if the arc length is 5 cm and the radius is 8 cm, your new numerator will be 40.


, You are dividing the numerator found in step two. This gives you the area of the sector.

For example, 402=20{\displaystyle {\frac {40}{2}}=20}.

Since you are finding the area, your answer will be in square centimeters.

Divide the result by 2.",How to Calculate the Area of a Rhombus1," The diagonals of a rhombus are the lines that connect the opposite vertices (corners) in the center of the shape. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and form four right triangles through their intersection.


Let's say the diagonals are 6 cm. and 8 cm. long.;
, Just write down the length of the diagonals and multiply them. In this case, 6 cm x 8 cm = 48 cm2. Don't forget to square the units since you're working in square units.

, Since 6 cm x 8 cm = 48 cm2, just divide the result by 2. 48 cm2/2 = 24 cm2. The area of the rhombus is 24 cm2.

Find the base and the height.,
Multiply the base and height.",How to Calculate the Area of a Rhombus2," You can also think of this as multiplying the altitude of the rhombus with the length of the side of the rhombus. Let's say the height of the rhombus is 7 cm and the base is 10 cm.

, Once you know the base and height of the rhombus, all you have to do to find the area of the shape is to multiply them. So, 10 cm x 7 cm = 70 cm2. The area of the rhombus is 70 cm2.

Understand the rectangle.,
Learn the equation for finding the area of a rectangle.",How to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle1," The rectangle is a quadrilateral, which means it has four sides. Its opposite sides are equal in length, so the sides along its length are equal, and the sides along its width are equal as well. If one side of the rectangle is 10, for example, then the opposite side's length will also be 10.


Also, every square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares. So treat squares like rectangles in terms of finding its area.;
, The equation for finding the area of a rectangle is simply A = L * W. This means that the area is equal to the length of the rectangle times its width.

State your answer in square units.",How to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle2," In most cases, you will be given the length, but if not, you can find it using a ruler.


Note that the double hash marks on the long sides of the rectangle mean that the lengths of the two sides are the same.

, Use the same methods to find it.


Note that the single hash marks on the wide sides of the rectangle mean that the two widths have equal length.

, In this example, the length is 5 cm and the width is 4 cm.

, Your length is 5 cm and your width is 4 cm, so you should plug them into the equation A = L * W to find the area.


A = 4 cm * 5 cm
A = 20 cm^2

, Your final answer is 20 cm^2, which means ""twenty centimeters squared.""


You can write your final answer in one of two ways: either 20 cm.sq. or 20 cm^2.

Understand the Pythagorean theorem.,
Use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the other side of the triangle.,
Multiply the length times the width.,
State your answer in square units.",How to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle3," The Pythagorean theorem is a formula for finding the third side of a right triangle if you know the value of two of the sides. You can use it to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, which is its longest side, or its length or width, which meet at a right angle.


Since a rectangle is comprised of four right angles, the diagonal that cuts through the shape will create a right triangle, so you can apply the Pythagorean theorem.
The theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are sides of the triangle and c is the hypotenuse, or longest side.

, Let's say that you have a rectangle with a side of 6 cm and a diagonal of 10 cm. Use 6 cm for one side, use b for the other side, and take 10 cm as your hypotenuse. Now just substitute your known quantities into the Pythagorean theorem and solve. Here's how to do it:



Ex: 6^2 + b^2 = 10^2
36 + b^2 = 100
b^2 = 100 - 36
b^2 = 64
square root (b) = square root (64)
b = 8

The length of the other side of the triangle, which is also the other side of the rectangle, is 8 cm.



, Now that you've used the Pythagorean theorem to find the length and width of the rectangle, all you have to do is multiply them.



Ex: 6 cm * 8 cm = 48 cm^2

, Your final answer is 48 cm^2, or 48 cm. sq.

Measure the distance between your base and the top of the parallelogram for height.,
Multiply the base by the height to find the area.,
Always add ""units squared"" at the end of your problem for the correct answer.",How to Calculate the Area of a Parallelogram1," If your problem gives you a measurement of the base and height of a parallelogram, simply multiply them to get your area. For example, if the base is 5, and the height 3, then your area is 15in2{\displaystyle 15in^{2}}, since 5∗3=15{\displaystyle 5*3=15}.The base is the length of the long, flat side on the bottom.

The height is the distance from the base straight up to its parallel side. 

Which side is the base and which is height is entirely up to you -- you could rotate any parallelogram to make any side the bottom and still get the same final answer.;
, A parallelogram consists of two sets of parallel lines, and one side is usually presented as the ""bottom,"" making two of your sides appear flat. Measure this flat edge and write it down as the base, or ""B.""

For this example, assume the base has a length of 10cm.


, This must be a 90-degree angle so that your measurement for the height is perpendicular to the base. The easiest way to get this is to measure from the bottom corner straight up, using a ruler to line everything up.


You do not measure the height by measuring the slanted sides., As long as your line is perpendicular (at a 90-degree angle to the base, this is your height. Write it down for ""H.""

For this example, assume that the height is 5cm.

 The height may be drawn outside of the parallelogram.


, Once you've got your two measurements, simply add them to the equation A=B∗H{\displaystyle A=B*H}, where A stands for your area. Finishing the work:


A=B∗H{\displaystyle A=B*H}


B=10cm;H=5cm{\displaystyle B=10cm;H=5cm}




A=10cm∗5cm{\displaystyle A=10cm*5cm}


Area of Parallelogram=50cm2{\displaystyle =50cm^{2}}, In the previous example, you could leave the answer as ""5."" But this doesn't actually tell you how big the parallelogram is -- inches, miles, centimeters, etc. Since area is a measure of space, you need to tell the reader, teacher, or client how much space you measured. Since the problem above used centimeters, the final answer was ""centimeters squared."" This means that the parallelogram could fit ""five perfect 1-centimeter squares"" inside of it.

Simply square the units used to measure to get your answer. If you measured base and height in meters, your final answer would be in ""meters squared,"" or ""m2{\displaystyle m^{2}}""

If you have no measurements given, provide your answer in ""units2{\displaystyle units^{2}}."""

Find the width by measuring a side that is moving away from your length and height sides.,
Add all three of your measurements to the formula to get your surface area.,
Always add ""units squared"" to your final answer to indicate your measurements.",How to Calculate the Area of a Parallelogram2," Three-dimensional parallelograms also called ""parallelepipeds,"" are as easy to solve as any other 3D rectangle. Simply find your three measurements-- length (l), height (h), and width (w), and then input them into the following formula:


Lateral Surface Area = 2(lh+lw+hw){\displaystyle 2(lh+lw+hw)}


, If you've got a rectangular solid (a math term for a box) where one of the sides is a parallelogram, you can measure the length and height the exact same way as when you measured the length and height for a 2D parallelogram. Remember that these two measurements must be perpendicular, meaning they must form a right-angle, for the measurements to be correct. When done, write down these measurements as length and height.Remember -- the height is not the length of the diagonal side -- it is the distance between the side you measured for length and its parallel side.

For this example, say that l=6;h=4{\displaystyle l=6;h=4}, and that you measured in inches.


, This is the last distance you haven't measured. Just make sure that you don't re-measure a side that is parallel to your length or height -- the width should be a distinct measurement. You should be able to take all three measurements from the exact same point, with each line perpendicular to each other line.

For this example, say that the width is w=5in{\displaystyle w=5in}.


, Once you've measured all three sides, or if the problem gives them to you. then you're ready to finally solve. Simply input it all into the formula:

Lateral Surface Area =2(lh+lw+hw){\displaystyle =2(lh+lw+hw)}


l=6in;h=4in;w=5in{\displaystyle l=6in;h=4in;w=5in}



Lateral Surface Area=2(6∗4+6∗5+4∗5){\displaystyle =2(6*4+6*5+4*5)}

Lateral Surface Area=2(24+30+20){\displaystyle =2(24+30+20)}

Lateral Surface Area=2(74){\displaystyle =2(74)}


Lateral Surface Area=148in2{\displaystyle =148in^{2}}


, Again, remember that ""148"" means nothing if you don't know if it measures inches, feet, or kilometers. Surface area is obviously another form of area, meaning it requires ""units squared"" even though you're measuring a 3D object. For the example, the prior problem would be in ""inches squared.""

If you forget which units to use, simply look at the original problem. Remember that 32{\displaystyle 3^{2}} is really just a way to write out 3∗3{\displaystyle 3*3}. In your problem, you multiply measurements, like A=3ft∗3ft{\displaystyle A=3ft*3ft}. Just like you could say that the area is 32{\displaystyle 3^{2}}, you also say the units are ft2{\displaystyle ft^{2}}."

Write down the formula for finding the area of a hexagon if you know the side length.,
Identify the length of one side.,
Plug the value of the side length into the formula.,
Simplify your answer.",How to Calculate the Area of a Hexagon1," Since a regular hexagon is comprised of six equilateral triangles, the formula for finding the area of a hexagon is derived from the formula of finding the area of an equilateral triangle. The formula for finding the area of a hexagon is Area = (3√3 s2)/ 2 where s is the length of a side of the regular hexagon., If you already know the length of a side, then you can simply write it down; in this case, the length of a side is 9 cm. If you don't know the length of a side but know the length of the perimeter or apothem (the height of one of the equilateral triangles formed by the hexagon, which is perpendicular to the side), you can still find the length of the side of the hexagon. Here's how you do it:


If you know the perimeter, then just divide it by 6 to get the length of one side. For example, if the length of the perimeter is 54 cm, then divide it by 6 to get 9 cm, the length of the side.
If you only know the apothem, you can find the length of a side by plugging the apothem into the formula a = x√3 and then multiplying the answer by two. This is because the apothem represents the x√3 side of the 30-60-90 triangle that it creates. If the apothem is 10√3, for example, then x is 10 and the length of a side is 10 * 2, or 20.

, Since you know that the length of one side of the triangle is 9, just plug 9 into the original formula. It will look like this: Area = (3√3 x 92)/2

, Find the value of equation and write the numerical answer. Since you're working with area, you should state your answer in square units. Here's how you do it:


(3√3 x 92)/2 =
(3√3 x 81)/2 =
(243√3)/2 =

Identify the radius of a circle.,
Square the radius.,
Multiply by pi.,
Report your result.",How to Calculate the Area of a Circle1," The radius is the length from the center of a circle to the edge of the circle. You can measure this in any direction and the radius will be the same. The radius is also one half of the diameter of a circle. The diameter is the line segment that passes through the center and connects opposite sides of the circle.The radius will generally be provided to you. It can be difficult to measure to the exact center of a circle, unless the center is already marked for you on a circle drawn on paper.

For this example, assume that you are told that the radius of a given circle is 6 cm.
;
, The formula to find the area of a circle is A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}, where the r{\displaystyle r} variable represents the radius. This variable is squared.Do not get confused and square the entire equation.

For the sample circle with radius, r=6{\displaystyle r=6}, then r2=36{\displaystyle r^{2}=36}.


, Pi, written symbolically with the Greek letter π{\displaystyle \pi }, is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of the circle.As a decimal approximation, π{\displaystyle \pi } is approximately 3.14. The true decimal value continues on infinitely. For an exact statement of the area of a circle, you will usually report your answer using the symbol π{\displaystyle \pi } itself.For the given example with a radius of 6 cm, the area is calculated as:


A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}


A=π62{\displaystyle A=\pi 6^{2}}


A=36π{\displaystyle A=36\pi } or A=36(3.14)=113.04{\displaystyle A=36(3.14)=113.04}




, Remember that a calculation of area is going to be reported in “square” units. If the radius was measured in centimeters, the area will be in square centimeters. If the radius was measured in feet, the area will be in square feet. You should also know whether to report your result using the symbol π{\displaystyle \pi } or the numerical approximation. If you do not know, then report both.For the sample circle with a radius of 6 cm, the area will be either 36π{\displaystyle \pi } cm2 or 113.04 cm2.

Write down the formula for finding the area of a hexagon with a given apothem.,
Write down the apothem.,
Use the apothem to find the perimeter.,
Plug all of the known quantities into the formula.,
Simplify your answer.",How to Calculate the Area of a Hexagon2," The formula is simply Area = 1/2 x perimeter x apothem., Let's say the apothem is 5√3 cm.

, Since the apothem is perpendicular to the side of the hexagon, it creates one side of a 30-60-90 triangle. The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the proportion of x-x√3-2x, where the length of the short leg, which is across from the 30 degree angle, is represented by x, the length of the long leg, which is across from the 60 degree angle, is represented by x√3, and the hypotenuse is represented by 2x.The apothem is the side that is represented by x√3. Therefore, plug the length of the apothem into the formula a = x√3 and solve. If the apothem's length is 5√3, for example, plug it into the formula and get 5√3 cm = x√3, or x = 5 cm.
By solving for x, you have found the length of the short leg of the triangle, 5. Since it represents half the length of one side of the hexagon, multiply it by 2 to get the full length of the side. 5 cm x 2 = 10 cm.
Now that you know that the length of one side is 10, just multiply it by 6 to find the perimeter of the hexagon. 10 cm x 6 = 60 cm

, The hardest part was finding the perimeter. Now, all you have to do is plug the apothem and perimeter into the formula and solve:


Area = 1/2 x perimeter x apothem
Area = 1/2 x 60 cm x 5√3 cm

, Simplify the expression until you've removed the radicals from the equation. State your final answer in square units.


1/2 x 60 cm x 5√3 cm =

Each row will be labeled by the names of the six points (Point A, Point B, Point C, etc), and each column will be labeled as the x or y coordinates of those points. List the x and y coordinates of Point A to the right of Point A, the x and y coordinates of Point B to the right of Point B, and so on. Repeat the coordinates of the first point at the bottom of the list. Let's say you're working with the following points, in (x, y) format:A: (4, 10)
B: (9, 7)
C: (11, 2)
D: (2, 2)
E: (1, 5)
F: (4, 7)
A (again): (4, 10)

, You can think of this as drawing a diagonal line to the right and downward one row from each x coordinate. List the results to the right of the chart. Then, add the results.


4 x 7 = 28
9 x 2 = 18
11 x 2 = 22

, Think of this as drawing a diagonal line from each y coordinate downward and to the left, to the x coordinate below it. Once you multiply all of these coordinates, add the results.


10 x 9 = 90
7 x 11 = 77
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 1 = 2
5 x 4 = 20
7 x 4 = 28
90 + 77 + 4 + 2 + 20 + 28 = 221

, Just subtract 221 from 125. 125 - 221 = -96. Now, take the absolute value of this answer: 96. Area can only be positive.

, Just divide 96 by 2 and you'll have the area of the irregular hexagon. 96/2 = 48. Don't forget to write your answer in square units. The final answer is 48 square units.

Find the area of a regular hexagon with a missing triangle.,
Break up an irregular hexagon into other triangles.,
Look for other shapes in the irregular hexagon.",How to Calculate the Area of a Hexagon4," If you know you're working with a regular hexagon that is missing one or more of its triangles, then the first thing you need to do is find the area of the entire regular hexagon as if it were whole. Then, simply find the area of the empty or ""missing"" triangle, and that subtract that from the overall area. This will give you the area of the remaining irregular hexagon.


For example, if you've found that the area of the regular hexagon is 60 cm2 and you've found that the area of the missing triangle is 10 cm2 simply subtract the area of the missing triangle from the entire area: 60 cm2 - 10 cm2 = 50 cm2.
If you know that the hexagon is missing exactly one triangle, you can also just find the area of the hexagon by multiplying the total area by 5/6, since the hexagon is retaining the area of 5 of its 6 triangles. If it's missing two triangles, you can multiply the total area by 4/6 (2/3), and so on.

, You may find that the irregular hexagon is actually composed of four triangles that are irregularly shaped. To find the area of the whole irregular hexagon, you need to find the area of each individual triangle and then add them up. There are a variety of ways to find the area of a triangle depending on the information that you have.

, If you can't simply pick apart a few triangles, look through the irregular hexagon to see if you can locate other shapes -- maybe a triangle, a rectangle, and/or a square. Once you've outlined the other shapes, just find their areas and add them up to get the area of the entire hexagon.


One type of irregular hexagon is comprised of two parallelograms. To get the areas of the parallelograms, just multiply their bases times their heights, just as you would do to find the area of a rectangle, and then add up their areas.

Measure or record the diameter.,
Divide the diameter in half.,
Use the original formula for area.,
Report the value of the area.",How to Calculate the Area of a Circle2," Some problems or situations will not provide you with the radius. Instead, you may be given the diameter of a circle. If the diameter is drawn into your diagram, you can measure it with a ruler. Alternatively, you may just be told the value of the diameter.

Assume for this example that the diameter of your circle is 20 inches.


, Remember that the diameter is equal to double the radius. Therefore, whatever value you are given for the diameter, cut it in half and you will have the radius.

Therefore, the sample circle with a diameter of 20 inches will have a radius of 20/2, or 10 inches.


, After converting the diameter to the radius, you are ready to use the formula A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}} to calculate the area of the circle. Insert the value for the radius and perform the remaining calculations as follows:


A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}


A=π102{\displaystyle A=\pi 10^{2}}


A=100π{\displaystyle A=100\pi }


, Recall that your area is to be reported in square units. In this example, the diameter was measured in inches, so the radius is in inches. Therefore, the area will be reported in square inches. For this sample, the area will be 100π{\displaystyle 100\pi } sq. in.

You can also provide the numerical approximation by multiplying by 3.14 instead of π{\displaystyle \pi }. This will give a result of (100)(3.14) = 314 sq. in.

Learn the revised formula.,
Measure or record the circumference.,
Use the relationship between circumference and radius to revise the formula.,
Substitute into the formula for the area of a circle.,
Use the revised formula to solve the area.,
Report your result.",How to Calculate the Area of a Circle3," If you know the circumference of a circle, you can use a revision of the formula for the area of a circle. This revised formula uses circumference directly, without the radius, to find area. This new formula is:


A=C24π{\displaystyle A={\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi }}}


, In some real world situations, you may not be able to measure the diameter or radius accurately. If the diameter is not drawn for you or the center is not identified, it can be difficult to approximate the center of a circle. For some physical circles - a pizza pan or a frying pan, for example - you may be able to use a tape measure and measure the circumference more accurately than you can measure the diameter.For this example, assume that you have been told or have measured that the circumference of a circle (or circular object) is 42 cm.


, The circumference of a circle is equal to pi times the diameter. This can be written as C=πd{\displaystyle C=\pi d}. Then, recall that the diameter is equal to twice the radius, or d=2r{\displaystyle d=2r}. You can combine these two equalities to create the following relationship: C=π2r{\displaystyle C=\pi 2r}. Rearrange this to isolate the variable r{\displaystyle r} by itself, as follows:C=π2r{\displaystyle C=\pi 2r}


C2π=r{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{2\pi }}=r}….. (divide both sides by 2π{\displaystyle \pi })


, You can create a modified version of the formula for the area of a circle, using this relationship between circumference and radius. Substitute this latest equality into the original area formula, as follows:A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}…..(original area formula)


A=π(C2π)2{\displaystyle A=\pi ({\frac {C}{2\pi }})^{2}}….. (substitute equality for r)


A=π(C24π2){\displaystyle A=\pi ({\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}}})}…..(square the fraction)


A=C24π{\displaystyle A={\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi }}}…..(cancel π{\displaystyle \pi } in numerator and denominator)


, Using this revised formula, written with the circumference instead of radius, you can use your given information and find the area directly. Insert the value of the circumference and perform the calculations as follows:For this sample, you were given C=42{\displaystyle C=42} inches.


A=C24π{\displaystyle A={\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi }}}


A=4224π{\displaystyle A={\frac {42^{2}}{4\pi }}}…..(insert value)


A=17644π{\displaystyle A={\frac {1764}{4\pi }}}.….(calculate 422)


A=441π{\displaystyle A={\frac {441}{\pi }}}…..(divide by 4)


, Unless you are told the circumference as a multiple of π{\displaystyle \pi }, then your result is likely to be a fraction with π{\displaystyle \pi } in the denominator. There is nothing wrong with this. You should report your area calculation in that term, or you may approximate it by dividing by 3.14.For this sample circle, with a circumference given as 42 cm, the area is 441π{\displaystyle {\frac {441}{\pi }}} sq. cm. 

If you approximate, 441π=4413.14=140.4{\displaystyle {\frac {441}{\pi }}={\frac {441}{3.14}}=140.4}. The area is approximately equal to 140 sq. cm.

Identify the known or given information.,
Define the chosen sector.,
Measure the central angle of the sector.,
Use a modified formula for area.,
Enter the values that you know and solve the area.,
Report the result.",How to Calculate the Area of a Circle4," In some problems, you may be told information about a sector of the circle and then be asked to find the area of the full circle. Read the problem carefully and look for information that will say something like, “A sector of Circle O has an area of 15π{\displaystyle \pi } cm2. Find the area of Circle O.”, A sector of a circle is a portion that is sometimes also referred to as a “wedge.” A sector is defined by drawing two radii from the center out to the edge of the circle. The space between these two radii is the sector., Use a protractor to measure the central angle made by the two radii. Set the base of the protractor along one of the radii, with the central point of the protractor aligned with the center of the circle. Then read the angle measurement that corresponds with the position of the second radius forming the sector.Make sure you know if you are measuring the small angle between the two radii or the greater angle outside them. The problem you are working on should define this for you. The sum of the small angle and the great angle will be 360 degrees. 

In some problems, instead of having you measure the central angle, the problem may just tell you the measurement. For example, you might be told, “The central angle of the sector is 45 degrees” or you may be expected to measure it.


, When you know the area of a sector and its central angle measurement, you can use the following modified formula to find the area of the circle:Acir=Asec360C{\displaystyle A_{cir}=A_{sec}{\frac {360}{C}}}


Acir{\displaystyle A_{cir}} is the area of the full circle


Asec{\displaystyle A_{sec}} is the area of the sector


C{\displaystyle C} is the central angle measure




, In this example, you have been told that the central angle is 45 degrees and that the sector has an area of 15π{\displaystyle \pi }. Insert these into this formula and solve as follows:Acir=Asec360C{\displaystyle A_{cir}=A_{sec}{\frac {360}{C}}}


Acir=15π36045{\displaystyle A_{cir}=15\pi {\frac {360}{45}}}


Acir=15π(8){\displaystyle A_{cir}=15\pi (8)}


Acir=120π{\displaystyle A_{cir}=120\pi }


, For this example, the sector was one-eighth of the full circle. Therefore, the area of the full circle is 120π{\displaystyle \pi } cm2. Since the sector’s area was given in terms of π{\displaystyle \pi }, you can assume that your area for the full circle should be reported the same way.If you want to report a numerical value, you can multiply 120 x 3.14 to get a value of 376.8 cm2.

Divide this difference by 2 to get the area of the polygon.",How to Calculate the Area of a Polygon," To find the area of a regular polygon, all you have to do is follow this simple formula: area = 1/2 x perimeter x apothem. Here is what it means:


Perimeter = the sum of the lengths of all the sides
Apothem = a segment that joins the polygon's center to the midpoint of any side that is perpendicular to that side

, If you're using the apothem method, then the apothem will be provided for you. Let's say you're working with a hexagon that has an apothem with a length of 10√3.

, If the perimeter is provided for you, then you're nearly done, but it's likely that you have a bit more work to do. If the apothem is provided for you and you know that you're working with a regular polygon, then you can use it to find the perimeter. Here's how you do it:


Think of the apothem as being the ""x√3"" side of a 30-60-90 triangle. You can think of it this way because the hexagon is made up of six equilateral triangles. The apothem cuts one of them in half, creating a triangle with 30-60-90 degree angles.
You know that the side across from the 60 degree angle has length = x√3, the side across from the 30 degree angle has length = x, and the side across from the 90 degree angle has length = 2x. If 10√3 represents ""x√3,"" then you can see that x = 10.
You know that x = half the length of the bottom side of the triangle. Double it to get the full length. The bottom side of the triangle is 20 units long. There are six of these sides to the hexagon, so multiply 20 x 6 to get 120, the perimeter of the hexagon.

, If you're using the formula area = 1/2 x perimeter x apothem, then you can plug in 120 for the perimeter and 10√3 for the apothem. Here is what it will look like:


area = 1/2 x 120 x 10√3
area = 60 x 10√3
area = 600√3

, You may need to state your answer in decimal instead of square root form. Just use your calculator to find the closest value for √3 and multiply it by 600. √3 x 600 = 1,039.2. This is your final answer.

, If you want to find the area of a regular triangle, all you have to do is follow this formula: area = 1/2 x base x height.


If you have a triangle with a base of 10 and a height of 8, then the area = 1/2 x 8 x 10, or 40.

, To find the area of a square, just square the length of one side. This is really the same thing as multiplying the base of the square by its height, because the base and height are the same.


If the square has a side length of 6, then the area is 6 x 6, or 36.

, To find the area of a rectangle, simply multiply the base times the height.


If the base of the rectangle is 4 and the height is 3, then the area of the rectangle is 4 x 3, or 12.

, The find the area of a trapezoid, you just have to follow this formula: area = /2.


Let's say you have a trapezoid with bases that have a length of 6 and 8 and a height of 10. The area is simple /2, which can be simplified to (14 x 10)/2, or 140/2, which makes for an area of 70.

, Determining the area for an irregular polygon can be found when you know the coordinates of the vertices.

, List the x and y coordinates of each vertex of the polygon in counterclockwise order. Repeat the coordinates of the first point at the bottom of the list.

, Add the results. The added sum of these products is 82.

, Again, add these results. The added total of these products is -38.

, Subtract -38 from 82 to get 82 - (-38) = 120.

, Just divide 120 by 2 to get 60 and you're all done.

Find the base and height of the triangle.,
Set up the formula for the area of a triangle.,
Plug the base and height into the formula.,
Find the area of a right triangle.",How to Calculate the Area of a Triangle1," The base is one side of the triangle. The height is the measure of the tallest point on a triangle. It is found by drawing a perpendicular line from the base to the opposite vertex. This information should be given to you, or you should be able to measure the lengths.

For example, you might have a triangle with a base measuring 5 cm long, and a height measuring 3 cm long.
;
, The formula is Area=12(bh){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(bh)}, where b{\displaystyle b} is the length of the triangle’s base, and h{\displaystyle h} is the height of the triangle., Multiply the two values together, then multiply their product by 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}. This will give you the area of the triangle in square units.

For example, if the base of your triangle is 5 cm and the height is 3 cm, you would calculate:Area=12(bh){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(bh)}Area=12(5)(3){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(5)(3)}Area=12(15){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(15)}Area=7.5{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=7.5} So, the area of a triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 3 cm is 7.5 square centimeters.


, Since two sides of a right triangle are perpendicular, one of the perpendicular sides will be the height of the triangle. The other side will be the base. So, even if the height and/or base is unstated, you are given them if you know the side lengths. Thus you can use the Area=12(bh){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(bh)} formula to find the area.

You can also use this formula if you know one side length, plus the length of the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and is opposite the right angle. Remember that you can find a missing side length of a right triangle using the  Pythagorean Theorem (a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}).

For example, if the hypotenuse of a triangle is side c, the height and base would be the other two sides (a and b). If you know that the hypotenuse is 5 cm, and the base is 4 cm, use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}a2+42=52{\displaystyle a^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}}a2+16=25{\displaystyle a^{2}+16=25}a2+16−16=25−16{\displaystyle a^{2}+16-16=25-16}a2=9{\displaystyle a^{2}=9}a=3{\displaystyle a=3}Now, you can plug the two perpendicular sides (a and b) into the area formula, substituting for the base and height:Area=12(bh){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(bh)}Area=12(4)(3){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(4)(3)}Area=12(12){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {1}{2}}(12)}Area=6{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=6}

You have to recognize what those are so you can break the larger object down into a series of smaller objects.


In this case, this object is composed of the following shapes: a triangle, a trapezoid, a rectangle, a square, and a semi-circle (half of a circle).;
, These formulas will allow you to use the given measurements of each shape to find their areas. Here are the formulas for finding the area of each shape:


Area of a Square = side2 = a2


Area of a Rectangle = width x height = w x h

Area of a Trapezoid = /2 = /2

Area of a Triangle = base x height x 1/2 = (b x h)/2

Area of a Semi-Circle = (π x radius2)/2 = (π x r2)/2

, Once you write down the formulas, write down the dimensions of each shape so you can plug them in. Here are the dimensions of each shape:


Square: a = 2.5 in
Rectangle = w = 4.5 in, h = 2.5 in
Trapezoid = a = 3 in, b = 5 in, h = 5 in
Triangle = b = 3 in, h = 2.5 in
Semi-Circle = r = 1.5 in

, Finding the area of each shape will lead you to find the area of each part of the shape; once you've found the area of each shape using the formula and measurements you were given, all you have to do is add up each area to find the area of the entire object. When calculating area, you have to remember to state the area in square units. The area of the entire object is 44.78 in2. Here's how you get it:


Find the area of each shape:

Area of Square = 2.5 in2 = 6.25 in2

Rectangle = 4.5 in x 2.5 in = 11.25 in2

Trapezoid = /2 = 20 in2

Triangle = 3 in x 2.5 in x 1/2 = 3.75 in2

Semi-Circle = 1.5 in2 x π x 1/2 = 3.53 in2



Add the areas of each shape together:

Area of Object = Area of Square + Area of Rectangle + Area of Trapezoid + Area of Semi-Circle
Area of Object = 6.25 in2 + 11.25 in2 + 20 in2 + 3.75 in2 + 3.53 in2

Area of Object = 44.78 in2




, The surface area is the total area of an object's faces and curved surfaces. Every three dimensional object has a surface area; the volume is the amount of space taken up by the object. Here are the formulas for finding the surface area of a variety of objects:



Surface area of a square = 6 x side2 = 6s2


Surface area of a cone = π x radius x side + π x radius2 = π x r x s + πr2


Surface area of a sphere = 4 x π x radius2 = 4πr2


Surface area of a cylinder = 2 x π x radius2 + 2 x π x radius x height = 2πr2 + 2πrh

Surface area of a square-based pyramid = side of base2 + 2 x side of base x h = b2 + 2bh

, Here they are:


Cube = side = 3.5 in
Cone = r = 2 in, h = 4 in
Sphere = r = 3 in
Cylinder = r = 2 in, h = 3.5 in
Square-Based Pyramid = b = 2 in, h = 4 in

, Now, all you have to do is plug the dimensions of each shape into the formula for finding the surface area of each shape and you're all done. Here's how you do it:


Surface area of the cube = 6 x 3.52 = 73.5 in2

Surface area of the cone = π(2 x 4) + π x 22 = 37.7 in2

Surface are of the sphere = 4 x π x 32 = 113.09 in2

Surface are of the cylinder = 2π x 22 + 2π(2 x 3.5) = 69.1 in2

Surface area of the square-based pyramid = 22 + 2(2 x 4) = 20 in2

Plug the semiperimeter and side lengths into the formula.,
Calculate the values in parentheses.,
Multiply the two values under the radical sign.",How to Calculate the Area of a Triangle2," The semi-perimeter of a figure is equal to half its perimeter. To find the semiperimeter, first calculate the perimeter of a triangle by adding up the length of its three sides. Then, multiply by 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.For example, if a triangle has three sides that are 5 cm, 4 cm, and 3 cm long, the semiperimeter is shown by:s=12(3+4+5){\displaystyle s={\frac {1}{2}}(3+4+5)}s=12(12)=6{\displaystyle s={\frac {1}{2}}(12)=6}


, The formula is Area=s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} is the semiperimeter of the triangle, and a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c} are the side lengths of the triangle., Make sure you substitute the semiperimeter for each instance of s{\displaystyle s} in the formula.

For example:Area=s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}}Area=6(6−3)(6−4)(6−5){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)}}}


, Subtract the length of each side from the semiperimeter. Then, multiply these three values together.

For example:Area=6(6−3)(6−4)(6−5){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)}}}Area=6(3)(2)(1){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {6(3)(2)(1)}}}Area=6(6){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {6(6)}}}


, Then, find their  square root. This will give you the area of the triangle in square units.

For example:Area=6(6){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {6(6)}}}Area=36{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {36}}}Area=6{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=6}So, the area of the triangle is 6 square centimeters.

, The formula is Area=(s2)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(s^{2}){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the equilateral triangle., Make sure you substitute for the variable s{\displaystyle s}, and then square the value.

For example if the equilateral triangle has sides that are 6 cm long, you would calculate:Area=(s2)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(s^{2}){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}Area=(62)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(6^{2}){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}Area=(36)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(36){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}


, It’s best to use the square root function on your calculator for a more precise answer. Otherwise, you can use 1.732 for the rounded value of 3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}}.

For example:Area=(36)34{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=(36){\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}}Area=62.3524{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {62.352}{4}}}


, This will give you the area of the triangle in square units.

For example:Area=62.3524{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {62.352}{4}}}Area=15.588{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=15.588}So, the area of an equilateral triangle with sides 6 cm long is about 15.59 square centimeters.

For example, you might have a triangle with two adjacent sides measuring 150 cm and 231 cm in length. The angle between them is 123 degrees.


, The formula is Area=bc2sin⁡A{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {bc}{2}}\sin A}, where b{\displaystyle b} and c{\displaystyle c} are the adjacent sides of the triangle, and A{\displaystyle A} is the angle between them., Make sure you substitute for the variables b{\displaystyle b} and c{\displaystyle c}. Multiply their values, then divide by 2.

For example:Area=bc2sin⁡A{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {bc}{2}}\sin A}Area=(150)(231)2sin⁡A{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {(150)(231)}{2}}\sin A}Area=(34,650)2sin⁡A{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\frac {(34,650)}{2}}\sin A}Area=17,325sin⁡A{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=17,325\sin A}


, You can find the sine using a scientific calculator by typing in the angle measurement then hitting the “SIN” button.

For example, the sine of a 123-degree angle is .83867, so the formula will look like this:Area=17,325sin⁡A{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=17,325\sin A}Area=17,325(.83867){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=17,325(.83867)}


, This will give you the area of the triangle in square units.

For example:Area=17,325(.83867){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=17,325(.83867)}Area=14,529.96{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}=14,529.96}.So, the area of the triangle is about 14,530 square centimeters.

Measure the lengths of the pieces you need.,
Add the individual lengths together.,
Check your project instructions.,
Convert units if needed.",How to Calculate Linear Feet1," Review the design plan for your project. Identify all the pieces of any particular material type that you need. Determine the length of each separate piece.

For example, suppose you are installing a new kitchen countertop. Your plan might require a two-foot length from the wall to the sink, a three-foot length from the end of the sink to the corner, and another two-foot length to wrap around the corner. 
;
, To find the total number of linear feet that you need for your project, add together the lengths of the individual parts. Imagine the individual pieces lined up end-to-end and determine the length from one end to the other.

In the countertop example, you need three pieces of two feet, three feet, and two feet. Thus, the total number of linear feet of countertop material that you need is 2+3+2=7 feet.


, For some projects, the design plan or instructions may tell you the number of linear feet that you need. For example, suppose you were knitting a sweater. It would be impossible to look at a picture of a sweater and determine the amount of yarn that you need. Somewhere, the instructions should tell you how much yarn to purchase.
, By definition, ""linear feet"" are measured in feet. However, the individual pieces you need may be measured in inches or a combination of feet and inches. It may help first to convert all your measurements to inches, then add them, and convert to feet and inches in your final step.

For example, suppose you have three pieces measuring 5'2"", 4'6"" and 3'8"". If you convert each of these to inches, you get 62"", 54"" and 44"". Add them to get a total of 160"". Divide this by 12 inches per foot, and you will get a total of 13 feet, with four inches left over. Thus, the total linear footage is 13 feet, 4 inches.

Nonlinear first-order equations.,
Homogeneous linear differential equations with constant coefficients.,
Reduction of order.,
Euler-Cauchy equation.,
Inhomogeneous linear differential equations with constant coefficients.",How to Solve Differential Equations," In this section, we discuss the methods of solving the linear first-order differential equation both in general and in the special cases where certain terms are set to 0. We let y=y(x),{\displaystyle y=y(x),} p(x),{\displaystyle p(x),} and q(x){\displaystyle q(x)} be functions of x.{\displaystyle x.}
dydx+p(x)y=q(x){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+p(x)y=q(x)}
p(x)=0.{\displaystyle p(x)=0.} By the fundamental theorem of calculus, the integral of a derivative of a function is the function itself. We can then simply integrate to obtain our answer. Remember that evaluating an indefinite integral introduces an arbitrary constant. 



y(x)=∫q(x)dx{\displaystyle y(x)=\int q(x){\mathrm {d} }x}


q(x)=0.{\displaystyle q(x)=0.} We use the technique of separation of variables. Separation of variables intuitively puts each variable on different sides of the equation. For example, we move all y{\displaystyle y} terms to one side and the x{\displaystyle x} terms to the other. We may treat the dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} and dy{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }y} in the derivative as quantities that are able to be moved around, but keep in mind that this is merely a shorthand for a manipulation that takes advantage of the chain rule. The exact nature of these objects, called differentials, are outside the scope of this article.


First, we get each variable on opposite sides of the equation.


1ydy=−p(x)dx{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{y}}{\mathrm {d} }y=-p(x){\mathrm {d} }x}



Integrate both sides. The integration introduces an arbitrary constant on both sides, but we may consolidate them on the right side.


ln⁡y=∫−p(x)dx{\displaystyle \ln y=\int -p(x){\mathrm {d} }x}


y(x)=e−∫p(x)dx{\displaystyle y(x)=e^{-\int p(x){\mathrm {d} }x}}




Example 1.1. In the last step, we take advantage of the exponent law ea+b=eaeb{\displaystyle e^{a+b}=e^{a}e^{b}} and replace eC{\displaystyle e^{C}} with C{\displaystyle C} because it is again an arbitrary constant.


dydx−2ysin⁡x=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}-2y\sin x=0}

p(x)≠0, q(x)≠0.{\displaystyle p(x)\neq 0,\ q(x)\neq 0.} To solve the general case, we introduce an integrating factor μ(x),{\displaystyle \mu (x),} a function of x{\displaystyle x} that makes the equation easier to solve by bringing the left side under a common derivative.


Multiply both sides by μ(x).{\displaystyle \mu (x).}


μdydx+μpy=μq{\displaystyle \mu {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+\mu py=\mu q}



In order to bring the left side under a common derivative, we must have the following.


ddx(μy)=dμdxy+μdydx=μdydx+μpy{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}(\mu y)={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\mu }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}y+\mu {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=\mu {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+\mu py}



The latter equation implies that dμdx=μp,{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\mu }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=\mu p,} which has the following solution. This is the integrating factor that solves every linear first-order equation. We may now proceed to derive a formula that solves this equation in terms of μ,{\displaystyle \mu ,} but it is more instructive to simply do the calculations. 


μ(x)=e∫p(x)dx{\displaystyle \mu (x)=e^{\int p(x){\mathrm {d} }x}}




Example 1.2. This example also introduces the notion of finding a particular solution to the differential equation given initial conditions.


tdydt+2y=t2,y(2)=3{\displaystyle t{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}+2y=t^{2},\quad y(2)=3}


dydt+2ty=t{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}+{\frac {2}{t}}y=t}


μ(x)=e∫p(t)dt=e2ln⁡t=t2{\displaystyle \mu (x)=e^{\int p(t){\mathrm {d} }t}=e^{2\ln t}=t^{2}}

This is an MIT OpenCourseWare video on solving linear first-order equations.

, In this section, we discuss the methods of solving certain nonlinear first-order differential equations. There is no general solution in closed form, but certain equations are able to be solved using the techniques below. 
dydx=f(x,y){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=f(x,y)}
dydx=h(x)g(y).{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=h(x)g(y).} If the function f(x,y)=h(x)g(y){\displaystyle f(x,y)=h(x)g(y)} can be separated into functions of one variable each, then the equation is said to be separable. We then proceed with the same method as before.


∫dyh(y)=∫g(x)dx{\displaystyle \int {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{h(y)}}=\int g(x){\mathrm {d} }x}


Example 1.3.


dydx=x3y(1+x4){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {x^{3}}{y(1+x^{4})}}}


∫ydy=∫x31+x4dx12y2=14ln⁡(1+x4)+Cy(x)=12ln⁡(1+x4)+C{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int y{\mathrm {d} }y&=\int {\frac {x^{3}}{1+x^{4}}}{\mathrm {d} }x\\{\frac {1}{2}}y^{2}&={\frac {1}{4}}\ln(1+x^{4})+C\\y(x)&={\frac {1}{2}}\ln(1+x^{4})+C\end{aligned}}}




dydx=g(x,y)h(x,y).{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {g(x,y)}{h(x,y)}}.} Let g(x,y){\displaystyle g(x,y)} and h(x,y){\displaystyle h(x,y)} be functions of x{\displaystyle x} and y.{\displaystyle y.} Then a homogeneous differential equation is an equation where g{\displaystyle g} and h{\displaystyle h} are homogeneous functions of the same degree. That is to say, the function satisfies the property g(αx,αy)=αkg(x,y),{\displaystyle g(\alpha x,\alpha y)=\alpha ^{k}g(x,y),} where k{\displaystyle k} is called the degree of homogeneity. Every homogeneous differential equation can be converted into a separable equation through a sufficient change of variables, either v=y/x{\displaystyle v=y/x} or v=x/y.{\displaystyle v=x/y.}



Example 1.4. The above discussion regarding homogeneity may be somewhat arcane. Let us see how this applies through an example.


dydx=y3−x3y2x{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {y^{3}-x^{3}}{y^{2}x}}}

We first observe that this is a nonlinear equation in y.{\displaystyle y.} We also see that this equation cannot be separated. However, it is a homogeneous differential equation because both the top and bottom are homogeneous of degree 3. Therefore, we can make the change of variables v=y/x.{\displaystyle v=y/x.}


dydx=yx−x2y2=v−1v2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {y}{x}}-{\frac {x^{2}}{y^{2}}}=v-{\frac {1}{v^{2}}}}


y=vx,dydx=dvdxx+v{\displaystyle y=vx,\quad {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }v}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}x+v}


dvdxx=−1v2.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }v}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}x=-{\frac {1}{v^{2}}}.} This is now a separable equation in v.{\displaystyle v.}


v(x)=−3ln⁡x+C3{\displaystyle v(x)={\sqrt{-3\ln x+C}}}


y(x)=x−3ln⁡x+C3{\displaystyle y(x)=x{\sqrt{-3\ln x+C}}}




dydx=p(x)y+q(x)yn.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=p(x)y+q(x)y^{n}.} This is the Bernoulli differential equation, a particular example of a nonlinear first-order equation with solutions that can be written in terms of elementary functions. 


Multiply by (1−n)y−n.{\displaystyle (1-n)y^{-n}.} 


(1−n)y−ndydx=p(x)(1−n)y1−n+(1−n)q(x){\displaystyle (1-n)y^{-n}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=p(x)(1-n)y^{1-n}+(1-n)q(x)}



Use the chain rule on the left side to convert the equation into a linear equation in y1−n,{\displaystyle y^{1-n},} which can then be solved using the previous techniques.


dy1−ndx=p(x)(1−n)y1−n+(1−n)q(x){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y^{1-n}}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=p(x)(1-n)y^{1-n}+(1-n)q(x)}




M(x,y)+N(x,y)dydx=0.{\displaystyle M(x,y)+N(x,y){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=0.} Here, we discuss exact equations. We wish to find a function φ(x,y),{\displaystyle \varphi (x,y),} called the potential function, such that dφdx=0.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\varphi }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=0.}


To fulfill this condition, we have the following total derivative. The total derivative allows for additional variable dependencies. To calculate the total derivative of φ{\displaystyle \varphi } with respect to x,{\displaystyle x,} we allow for the possibility that y{\displaystyle y} may also depend on x.{\displaystyle x.}


dφdx=∂φ∂x+∂φ∂ydydx{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\varphi }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}={\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial y}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}}



Comparing terms, we have M(x,y)=∂φ∂x{\displaystyle M(x,y)={\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial x}}} and N(x,y)=∂φ∂y.{\displaystyle N(x,y)={\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial y}}.} It is a standard result from multivariable calculus that mixed derivatives for smooth functions are equal to each other. This is sometimes known as Clairaut's theorem. The differential equation is then exact if the following condition holds.


∂M∂y=∂N∂x{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial M}{\partial y}}={\frac {\partial N}{\partial x}}}



The method of solving exact equations is similar to finding potential functions in multivariable calculus, which we go into very shortly.  We first integrate M{\displaystyle M} with respect to x.{\displaystyle x.} Because M{\displaystyle M} is a function of both x{\displaystyle x} and y,{\displaystyle y,} the integration can only partially recover φ,{\displaystyle \varphi ,} which the term φ~{\displaystyle {\tilde {\varphi }}} is intended to remind the reader of. There is also an integration constant that is a function of y.{\displaystyle y.}


φ(x,y)=∫M(x,y)dx=φ~(x,y)+c(y){\displaystyle \varphi (x,y)=\int M(x,y){\mathrm {d} }x={\tilde {\varphi }}(x,y)+c(y)}



We then take the partial derivative of our result with respect to y,{\displaystyle y,} compare terms with N(x,y),{\displaystyle N(x,y),} and integrate to obtain c(y).{\displaystyle c(y).} We can also start by integrating N{\displaystyle N} first and then taking the partial derivative of our result with respect to x{\displaystyle x} to solve for the arbitrary function d(x).{\displaystyle d(x).} Either method is fine, and usually, the simpler function to integrate is chosen.


N(x,y)=∂φ∂y=∂φ~∂y+dcdy{\displaystyle N(x,y)={\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial y}}={\frac {\partial {\tilde {\varphi }}}{\partial y}}+{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }c}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}}




Example 1.5. We can check that the equation below is exact by doing the partial derivatives.


3x2+y2+2xydydx=0{\displaystyle 3x^{2}+y^{2}+2xy{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}=0}


φ=∫(3x2+y2)dx=x3+xy2+c(y)∂φ∂y=N(x,y)=2xy+dcdy{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\varphi &=\int (3x^{2}+y^{2}){\mathrm {d} }x=x^{3}+xy^{2}+c(y)\\{\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial y}}&=N(x,y)=2xy+{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }c}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}\end{aligned}}}


dcdy=0,c(y)=C{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }c}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}=0,\quad c(y)=C}


x3+xy2=C{\displaystyle x^{3}+xy^{2}=C}



If our differential equation is not exact, then there are certain instances where we can find an integrating factor that makes it exact. However, these equations are even harder to find applications of in the sciences, and integrating factors, though guaranteed to exist, are not at all guaranteed to easily be found. As such, we will not go into them here.

, These equations are some of the most important to solve because of their widespread applicability. Here, homogeneous does not refer to homogeneous functions, but the fact that the equation is set to 0. We will see in the next section on how to solve the corresponding inhomogeneous differential equations. Below, a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are constants.
d2ydx2+adydx+by=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+a{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+by=0}
Characteristic equation. This differential equation is notable because we can solve it very easily if we make some observations about what properties its solutions must have. This equation tells us that y{\displaystyle y} and its derivatives are all proportional to each other. From our previous examples in dealing with first-order equations, we know that only the exponential function has this property. Therefore, we will put forth an ansatz – an educated guess – on what the solution will be. 


This ansatz is the exponential function erx,{\displaystyle e^{rx},} where r{\displaystyle r} is a constant to be determined. Substituting into the equation, we have the following.


erx(r2+ar+b)=0{\displaystyle e^{rx}(r^{2}+ar+b)=0}



This equation tells us that an exponential function multiplied by a polynomial must equal 0. We know that the exponential function cannot be 0 anywhere. The polynomial being set to 0 is deemed the characteristic equation. We have effectively converted a differential equation problem into an algebraic equation problem – a problem that is much easier to solve.


r2+ar+b=0{\displaystyle r^{2}+ar+b=0}


r±=−a±a2−4b2{\displaystyle r_{\pm }={\frac {-a\pm {\sqrt {a^{2}-4b}}}{2}}}



We obtain two roots. Because this differential equation is a linear equation, the general solution consists of a linear combination of the individual solutions. Because this is a second-order equation, we know that this is the general solution. There are no others to be found. A more rigorous justification is contained in the existence and uniqueness theorems found in the literature.

A useful way to check if two solutions are linearly independent is by way of the Wronskian. The Wronskian W{\displaystyle W} is the determinant of a matrix whose columns are the functions and their successive derivatives going down the rows. A theorem in linear algebra is that the functions in the Wronskian matrix are linearly dependent if the Wronskian vanishes. In this part, we can check if two solutions are linearly independent by making sure that the Wronskian does not vanish. The Wronskian will become important in solving inhomogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients via the variation of parameters.


W=|y1y2y1′y2′|{\displaystyle W={\begin{vmatrix}y_{1}&y_{2}\\y_{1}'&y_{2}'\end{vmatrix}}}



In terms of linear algebra, the solution set of this differential equation spans a vector space with dimension equal to the order of the differential equation. The solutions form a basis and are therefore linearly independent of one another. This is possible because the function y(x){\displaystyle y(x)} is being acted on by a linear operator. The derivative is a linear operator because it maps the space of differentiable functions to the space of all functions. The reason why this is a homogeneous equation is because, for any linear operator L,{\displaystyle L,} we are looking for solutions of the equation L=0.{\displaystyle L=0.}


We now proceed to go over two of the three cases. The repeated roots case will have to wait until the section on reduction of order.Two real and distinct roots. If r±{\displaystyle r_{\pm }} are both real and are distinct, then the solution to the differential equation is given below.



y(x)=c1er+x+c2er−x{\displaystyle y(x)=c_{1}e^{r_{+}x}+c_{2}e^{r_{-}x}}


Two complex roots. It is a corollary of the fundamental theorem of algebra that solutions to polynomial equations with real coefficients contain roots that are real or come in conjugate pairs. Hence if r=α+iβ{\displaystyle r=\alpha +i\beta } is complex and is a root of the characteristic equation, then r∗=α−iβ{\displaystyle r^{*}=\alpha -i\beta } is a root as well. We can then write out the solution as c1e(α+iβ)x+c2e(α−iβ)x,{\displaystyle c_{1}e^{(\alpha +i\beta )x}+c_{2}e^{(\alpha -i\beta )x},} but this solution is complex and is undesirable as an answer for a real differential equation.


We can instead make use of Euler's formula eix=cos⁡x+isin⁡x{\displaystyle e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x} to write out the solution in terms of trigonometric functions. 


eαx(c1cos⁡βx+ic1sin⁡βx+c2cos⁡βx−ic2sin⁡βx){\displaystyle e^{\alpha x}(c_{1}\cos \beta x+ic_{1}\sin \beta x+c_{2}\cos \beta x-ic_{2}\sin \beta x)}



We now replace the constant c1+c2{\displaystyle c_{1}+c_{2}} with c1{\displaystyle c_{1}} and replace i(c1−c2){\displaystyle i(c_{1}-c_{2})} with c2.{\displaystyle c_{2}.} This yields the solution below.


y(x)=eαx(c1cos⁡βx+c2sin⁡βx){\displaystyle y(x)=e^{\alpha x}(c_{1}\cos \beta x+c_{2}\sin \beta x)}



There is yet another way to write out this solution in terms of an amplitude and phase, which is typically more useful in physical applications. See the main article for details on this calculation.


Example 2.1. Find the solution to the differential equation below given initial conditions. To do so, we must use our solution as well as its derivative and substitute initial conditions in both results to solve for the arbitrary constants.

This is an MIT OpenCourseWare video on solving homogeneous linear second-order equations with constant coefficients.
, Reduction of order is a method in solving differential equations when one linearly independent solution is known. The method works by reducing the order of the equation by one, allowing for the equation to be solved using the techniques outlined in the previous part. Let y1(x){\displaystyle y_{1}(x)} be the known solution. The basic idea of reduction of order is to look for a solution of the following form, where v(x){\displaystyle v(x)} is a function to be determined, substitute into the differential equation, and solve for v(x).{\displaystyle v(x).} We will see how reduction of order can be applied in finding the solution to the differential equation with constant coefficients with repeated roots.
y(x)=v(x)y1(x){\displaystyle y(x)=v(x)y_{1}(x)}
Repeated roots to the homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. Recall that a second-order equation should have two linearly independent solutions. If the characteristic equation yields a repeating root, then the solution set fails to span the space because the solutions are linearly dependent. We must then use reduction of order to find the second linearly independent solution.


Let r{\displaystyle r} denote the repeated root of the characteristic equation. We assume the second solution as y(x)=erxv(x){\displaystyle y(x)=e^{rx}v(x)} and substitute this into the differential equation. We find that most of the terms, save the term with the second derivative of v,{\displaystyle v,} cancel. 


v″(x)erx=0{\displaystyle v''(x)e^{rx}=0}




Example 2.2. Suppose we were working with the equation below, which has the repeated root r=−4.{\displaystyle r=-4.} Our substitution then fortuitously cancels most of the terms.


d2ydx2+8dydx+16y=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+8{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+16y=0}


y=v(x)e−4xy′=v′(x)e−4x−4v(x)e−4xy″=v″(x)e−4x−8v′(x)e−4x+16v(x)e−4x{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y&=v(x)e^{-4x}\\y'&=v'(x)e^{-4x}-4v(x)e^{-4x}\\y''&=v''(x)e^{-4x}-8v'(x)e^{-4x}+16v(x)e^{-4x}\end{aligned}}}


v″e−4x−8v′e−4x+16ve−4x+8v′e−4x−32ve−4x+16ve−4x=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v''e^{-4x}&-{\cancel {8v'e^{-4x}}}+{\cancel {16ve^{-4x}}}\\&+{\cancel {8v'e^{-4x}}}-{\cancel {32ve^{-4x}}}+{\cancel {16ve^{-4x}}}=0\end{aligned}}}



Much like our ansatz for the differential equation with constant coefficients, only the second derivative can be 0 here. Integrating twice leads to the desired expression for v.{\displaystyle v.}


v(x)=c1+c2x{\displaystyle v(x)=c_{1}+c_{2}x}



The general solution to the differential equation with constant coefficients given repeated roots in its characteristic equation can then be written like so. As a handy way of remembering, one merely multiply the second term with an x{\displaystyle x} to achieve linear independence. Because this set is linearly independent, we have found all the solutions to this equation, and are done.


y(x)=(c1+c2x)erx{\displaystyle y(x)=(c_{1}+c_{2}x)e^{rx}}




d2ydx2+p(x)dydx+q(x)y=0.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+p(x){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+q(x)y=0.} Reduction of order applies if we know a solution y1(x){\displaystyle y_{1}(x)} to this equation, whether found by chance or given in a problem.


We look for a solution of the form y(x)=v(x)y1(x){\displaystyle y(x)=v(x)y_{1}(x)} and proceed to substitute this into the equation.


v″y1+2v′y1′+p(x)v′y1+v(y1″+p(x)y1′+q(x))=0{\displaystyle v''y_{1}+2v'y_{1}'+p(x)v'y_{1}+v(y_{1}''+p(x)y_{1}'+q(x))=0}



Because y1{\displaystyle y_{1}} is already a solution to the differential equation, the terms with v{\displaystyle v} all vanish. What remains is a linear, first-order equation. To see this more clearly, make the change of variables w(x)=v′(x).{\displaystyle w(x)=v'(x).}


y1w′+(2y1′+p(x)y1)w=0{\displaystyle y_{1}w'+(2y_{1}'+p(x)y_{1})w=0}


w(x)=exp(∫(2y1′(x)y1(x)+p(x))dx){\displaystyle w(x)=\exp \left(\int \left({\frac {2y_{1}'(x)}{y_{1}(x)}}+p(x)\right){\mathrm {d} }x\right)}


v(x)=∫w(x)dx{\displaystyle v(x)=\int w(x){\mathrm {d} }x}



If the integrals can be done, then one would obtain the general solution in terms of elementary functions. If not, then the solution can be left in integral form.

, The Euler-Cauchy equation is a specific example of a second-order differential equation with variable coefficients that contain exact solutions. This equation is seen in some applications, such as when solving Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates.
x2d2ydx2+axdydx+by=0{\displaystyle x^{2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+ax{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+by=0}
Characteristic equation. The structure of this differential equation is such that each term is multiplied by a power term whose degree is equal to the order of the derivative.


This suggests that we try the ansatz y(x)=xn,{\displaystyle y(x)=x^{n},} where n{\displaystyle n} is yet to be determined, in a similar manner as trying the exponential function in dealing with the linear differential equation with constant coefficients. After differentiating and substituting, we obtain the following.


xn(n2+(a−1)n+b)=0{\displaystyle x^{n}(n^{2}+(a-1)n+b)=0}



Here, we must assume that x≠0{\displaystyle x\neq 0} in order for us to use the characteristic equation. The point x=0{\displaystyle x=0} is called a regular singular point of the differential equation, a property that becomes important when solving differential equations using power series. This equation has two roots, which may be real and distinct, repeated, or complex conjugates.


n±=1−a±(a−1)2−4b2{\displaystyle n_{\pm }={\frac {1-a\pm {\sqrt {(a-1)^{2}-4b}}}{2}}}




Two real and distinct roots. If n±{\displaystyle n_{\pm }} are both real and are distinct, then the solution to the differential equation is given below.



y(x)=c1xn++c2xn−{\displaystyle y(x)=c_{1}x^{n_{+}}+c_{2}x^{n_{-}}}


Two complex roots. If n±=α±βi{\displaystyle n_{\pm }=\alpha \pm \beta i} are the roots to the characteristic equation, then we obtain a complex function as our solution.


To convert this into a real function, we make the change of variables x=et,{\displaystyle x=e^{t},} implying t=ln⁡x,{\displaystyle t=\ln x,} and use Euler's formula. A similar process is conducted as before in reassigning arbitrary constants.


y(t)=eαt(c1eβit+c2e−βit){\displaystyle y(t)=e^{\alpha t}(c_{1}e^{\beta it}+c_{2}e^{-\beta it})}



The general solution can then be written as follows.


y(x)=xα(c1cos⁡(βln⁡x)+c2sin⁡(βln⁡x)){\displaystyle y(x)=x^{\alpha }(c_{1}\cos(\beta \ln x)+c_{2}\sin(\beta \ln x))}




Repeated roots. To obtain the second linearly independent solution, we must use reduction of order again. 


There is much algebra involved, but the concept remains the same: we substitute y=v(x)y1{\displaystyle y=v(x)y_{1}} into the equation, where y1{\displaystyle y_{1}} is the first solution. Terms will cancel, and we are left with the following equation.


v″+1xv′=0{\displaystyle v''+{\frac {1}{x}}v'=0}



This is a linear first-order equation in v′(x).{\displaystyle v'(x).} Its solution is v(x)=c1+c2ln⁡x.{\displaystyle v(x)=c_{1}+c_{2}\ln x.} Our answer can therefore be written as follows. An easy way to remember this solution is that the second linearly independent solution merely needs an extra ln⁡x{\displaystyle \ln x} term.

y(x)=xn(c1+c2ln⁡x){\displaystyle y(x)=x^{n}(c_{1}+c_{2}\ln x)}



, The inhomogeneous case deals with the equation L=f(x),{\displaystyle L=f(x),} where f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} is called the source term. According to the theory of differential equations, the general solution to this equation is the superposition of the particular solution yp(x){\displaystyle y_{p}(x)} and the complementary solution yc(x).{\displaystyle y_{c}(x).} The particular solution here, confusingly, refers not to a solution given initial conditions, but rather the solution that exists as a result of the inhomogeneous term. The complementary solution refers to the solution of the corresponding homogeneous differential equation by setting f(x)=0.{\displaystyle f(x)=0.} We may show that the general solution is a superposition of these two solutions by writing L=L+L=f(x){\displaystyle L=L+L=f(x)} and noting that because L=0,{\displaystyle L=0,} this superposition is indeed the general solution.
d2ydx2+adydx+by=f(x){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+a{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}+by=f(x)}
Method of undetermined coefficients. The method of undetermined coefficients is a method that works when the source term is some combination of exponential, trigonometric, hyperbolic, or power terms. These terms are the only terms that have a finitely many number of linearly independent derivatives. In this section, we concentrate on finding the particular solution. 


Compare the terms in f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} with the terms in yc,{\displaystyle y_{c},} disregarding multiplicative constants. There are three cases. 


None of the terms are the same. The particular solution yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will then consist of a linear combination of the terms in yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} and their linearly independent derivatives.


f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} contains a term h(x){\displaystyle h(x)} that is xn{\displaystyle x^{n}} times a term in yc,{\displaystyle y_{c},} where n{\displaystyle n} is 0 or a positive integer, but this term originated from a distinct root of the characteristic equation. In this case, yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will consist of a linear combination of xn+1h(x),{\displaystyle x^{n+1}h(x),} its linearly independent derivatives, as well as the other terms of f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} and their linearly independent derivatives.


f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} contains a term h(x){\displaystyle h(x)} that is xn{\displaystyle x^{n}} times a term in yc,{\displaystyle y_{c},} where n{\displaystyle n} is 0 or a positive integer, but this term originated from a repeated root of the characteristic equation. In this case, yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} will consist of a linear combination of xn+sh(x){\displaystyle x^{n+s}h(x)} (where s{\displaystyle s} is the multiplicity of the root) and its linearly independent derivatives, as well as the other terms of f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} and their linearly independent derivatives.



Write out yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} as a linear combination of the aforementioned terms. The coefficients in this linear combination refer to the namesake of ""undetermined coefficients."" If terms that are in yc{\displaystyle y_{c}} appear, they may be discarded because of the presence of the arbitrary constants in yc.{\displaystyle y_{c}.} Once written out, substitute yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} into the equation and equate like terms.

Solve for the coefficients. In general, one encounters a system of algebraic equations at this point, but this system is usually not too difficult to solve. Once found, yp{\displaystyle y_{p}} is found, and we are done.


Example 2.3. The following differential equation is an inhomogeneous differential equation with a source term that contains a finitely many number of linearly independent derivatives. Hence we may use the method of undetermined coefficients to find its particular solution.


d2ydt2+6y=2e3t−cos⁡5t{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}y}{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}+6y=2e^{3t}-\cos 5t}


yc(t)=c1cos6t+c2sin6t{\displaystyle y_{c}(t)=c_{1}\cos {\sqrt {6}}t+c_{2}\sin {\sqrt {6}}t}


yp(t)=Ae3t+Bcos⁡5t+Csin⁡5t{\displaystyle y_{p}(t)=Ae^{3t}+B\cos 5t+C\sin 5t}


9Ae3t−25Bcos⁡5t−25Csin⁡5t+6Ae3t+6Bcos⁡5t+6Csin⁡5t=2e3t−cos⁡5t{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}9Ae^{3t}-25B\cos 5t&-25C\sin 5t+6Ae^{3t}\\&+6B\cos 5t+6C\sin 5t=2e^{3t}-\cos 5t\end{aligned}}}


{9A+6A=2,A=215−25B+6B=−1,B=119−25C+6C=0,C=0{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}9A+6A=2,&A={\dfrac {2}{15}}\\-25B+6B=-1,&B={\dfrac {1}{19}}\\-25C+6C=0,&C=0\end{cases}}}


y(t)=c1cos6t+c2sin6t+215e3t+119cos⁡5t{\displaystyle y(t)=c_{1}\cos {\sqrt {6}}t+c_{2}\sin {\sqrt {6}}t+{\frac {2}{15}}e^{3t}+{\frac {1}{19}}\cos 5t}




Variation of parameters. Variation of parameters is a more general method of solving inhomogeneous differential equations, particularly when the source term does not contain a finitely many number of linearly independent derivatives. Source terms like tan⁡x{\displaystyle \tan x} and x−n{\displaystyle x^{-n}} warrant the use of variation of parameters to find the particular solution. Variation of parameters may even be used to solve differential equations with variable coefficients, though with the exception of the Euler-Cauchy equation, this is less common because the complementary solution is typically not written in terms of elementary functions.


Assume a solution of the form below. Its derivative is written on the second line. 


y(x)=v1(x)y1(x)+v2(x)y2(x){\displaystyle y(x)=v_{1}(x)y_{1}(x)+v_{2}(x)y_{2}(x)}


y′=v1′y1+v1y1′+v2′y2+v2y2′{\displaystyle y'=v_{1}'y_{1}+v_{1}y_{1}'+v_{2}'y_{2}+v_{2}y_{2}'}



Because the assumed solution is of a form in which there are two unknowns, yet there is only one equation, we must also impose an auxiliary condition. We choose the following auxiliary condition.


v1′y1+v2′y2=0{\displaystyle v_{1}'y_{1}+v_{2}'y_{2}=0}


y′=v1y1′+v2y2′{\displaystyle y'=v_{1}y_{1}'+v_{2}y_{2}'}


y″=v1′y1′+v1y1″+v2′y2′+v2y2″{\displaystyle y''=v_{1}'y_{1}'+v_{1}y_{1}''+v_{2}'y_{2}'+v_{2}y_{2}''}



Now we proceed to obtain the second equation. After substituting and rearranging terms, we can group terms containing v1{\displaystyle v_{1}} together and terms containing v2{\displaystyle v_{2}} together. These terms all cancel because y1{\displaystyle y_{1}} and y2{\displaystyle y_{2}} are solutions to the corresponding homogeneous equation. We are then left with the following system of equations.


v1′y1+v2′y2=0v1′y1′+v2′y2′=f(x){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v_{1}'y_{1}+v_{2}'y_{2}&=0\\v_{1}'y_{1}'+v_{2}'y_{2}'&=f(x)\\\end{aligned}}}



This system can be rearranged into a matrix equation of the form Ax=b,{\displaystyle A{\mathbf {x} }={\mathbf {b} },} whose solution is x=A−1b.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=A^{-1}{\mathbf {b} }.} The inverse of a 2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2} matrix is found by dividing by the determinant, swapping the diagonal elements, and negating the off-diagonal elements. The determinant of this matrix is, in fact, the Wronskian.


(v1′v2′)=1W(y2′−y2−y1′y1)(0f(x)){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}v_{1}'\\v_{2}'\end{pmatrix}}={\frac {1}{W}}{\begin{pmatrix}y_{2}'&-y_{2}\\-y_{1}'&y_{1}\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}0\\f(x)\end{pmatrix}}}



The formulas for v1{\displaystyle v_{1}} and v2{\displaystyle v_{2}} are given below. Just like in reduction of order, the integration here introduces an arbitrary constant that incorporates the complementary solution into the general solution of the differential equation.


v1(x)=−∫1Wf(x)y2(x)dx{\displaystyle v_{1}(x)=-\int {\frac {1}{W}}f(x)y_{2}(x){\mathrm {d} }x}


v2(x)=∫1Wf(x)y1(x)dx{\displaystyle v_{2}(x)=\int {\frac {1}{W}}f(x)y_{1}(x){\mathrm {d} }x}

We can clearly see that this equation is nonlinear from the P2{\displaystyle P^{2}} term. In general, nonlinear differential equations do not have solutions which can be written in terms of elementary functions, but the Bernoulli equation is an important exception. 


dPdt−kP=−kLP2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }P}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}-kP=-{\frac {k}{L}}P^{2}}


, When solving Bernoulli equations in general, we would multiply by (1−n)P−n,{\displaystyle (1-n)P^{-n},} where n{\displaystyle n} denotes the degree of the nonlinear term. In our case, it is 2. 


−P−2dPdt+kP−1=kL{\displaystyle -P^{-2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }P}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}+kP^{-1}={\frac {k}{L}}}


, We can apply the chain rule backwards to see that −P−2dPdt=dP−1dt.{\displaystyle -P^{-2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }P}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }P^{-1}}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}.} The equation is now linear in P−1.{\displaystyle P^{-1}.}


dP−1dt+kP−1=kL{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }P^{-1}}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}+kP^{-1}={\frac {k}{L}}}


, As standard for linear first order differential equations, we use the integrating factor e∫g(x)dx,{\displaystyle e^{\int g(x){\mathrm {d} }x},} where g(x){\displaystyle g(x)} is the coefficient of P−1,{\displaystyle P^{-1},} to convert into an exact equation.

Divide your project into different categories of materials.,
Calculate the length of each individual piece.,
Calculate the total length of each building material separately.,
Use your totals to determine the cost of your materials.,
Be conservative with your purchases.",How to Calculate Linear Feet2," Make a list of the separate materials you will need for your project. For example, separate out the different sizes of boards that you plan to use into separate categories. You will need to calculate the amount of material in each category.As a running example, suppose you are planning to build a bookshelf. The sides of the bookshelf will be made with four 2 x 4 boards, one in each corner. The top, bottom, and three shelves in the middle are made from 1 x 12 boards. In this case, divide the building materials into two categories, 2x4’s and 1x12’s.


, After deciding which building materials you will use in your project, determine the length of each individual piece.Take care not to measure the same pieces multiple times. It can be helpful to check off each board on a sketch of your project and label each piece with its length as you go.

In the bookshelf example, suppose that the four 2x4s are each eight feet long and that the five 1x12 boards you use for the top, bottom, and shelves are all four feet long.


, You need to determine how much of each type of board to buy in order to complete your project. Add up the lengths of the pieces of each board size. Keep them apart from each other and find a separate total for each style.In the bookshelf example, since you have four eight-foot long corner pieces made from 2x4 boards and five pieces made from 1x12 boards (three shelves plus the top and bottom), you can calculate totals as follows:

2x4 boards: 8 feet times 4 boards = 32 linear feet

1x12 boards: 4 feet times 5 boards = 20 linear feet




, When you know how much of each material you need for your project, you know how much you'll hypothetically need to buy. Find the price of each type of material (per foot) and multiply by the total linear foot value obtained for the type of material to find the approximate cost of the material.In the bookshelf example, you need 32 feet of 2x4 boards and 20 feet of 1x12 boards. Suppose 2x4s sell for $1.50 per linear foot and 1x12 boards sell for $2.25 per linear foot. In this case, you would determine the costs of these materials by multiplying as follows:

 2x4 boards: $1.50 x 32 = $48

 1x12 boards: $2.25 x 20 = $45




, When it comes to building projects, one of the most widely-circulated tips of the trade is to bring slightly more material than you think you'll need. This may cost a bit more up front, but it can save time and cost overall.

Calculate the square footage of your deck area.,
Decide the width of deck material you wish to use.,
Divide the total area by the width of the boards used.,
Plan for some waste.,
Purchase extra if you are planning a more creative design.",How to Calculate Linear Feet3," Assume for this example that you are building a simple rectangular deck. The area is found by multiplying the length of the deck by its width.For this example, suppose you are building a deck that is 12 feet long by 8 feet wide. The total area is (12 feet)(8 feet)=96 sq. ft.{\displaystyle (12{\text{ feet}})(8{\text{ feet}})=96{\text{ sq. ft.}}}.


, You are likely to find deck materials in widths ranging from four inches to twelve inches wide. You will need to consider the type of material, whether you want natural wood or artificial composite materials, and how your material choice will affect the overall look of your final project., When you know the size of your deck and the width of your building material, divide one by the other to calculate the linear footage that you need to buy.For a deck of 96 square feet, using 6 inch (1/2 foot) wide boards, you need:


linear feet=96 sq. ft.1/2 feet=192 feet{\displaystyle {\text{linear feet}}={\frac {96{\text{ sq. ft.}}}{1/2{\text{ feet}}}}=192{\text{ feet}}}




, You cannot expect that every board will be used perfectly in its full length. Professional builders plan for about 5% to 10% “waste” when purchasing. Multiply your linear footage by 1.05 (5%) or 1.10 (10%) to find the total you should purchase.For example, if you calculated a linear footage need of 192 feet, then you should get:


192∗1.05=201.6 feet{\displaystyle 192*1.05=201.6{\text{ feet}}}


192∗1.10=211.2 feet{\displaystyle 192*1.10=211.2{\text{ feet}}}




, The above calculations are based on a fairly simple rectangular deck with boards that are laid out in straight lines. If you plan to do something more creative, like laying the boards along diagonal lines, you are likely to waste more material in the corners making the boards fit. If so, you will need to plan more linear footage.

Write down your sample data set.,

Calculate the mean of the sample.,
Subtract the mean from each data point.,
Square each result.,
Find the sum of the squared values.,
Divide by n - 1, where n is the number of data points.,
Understand variance and standard deviation.",How to Calculate Variance2," In most cases, statisticians only have access to a sample, or a subset of the population they're studying. For example, instead of analyzing the population ""cost of every car in Germany,"" a statistician could find the cost of a random sample of a few thousand cars. He can use this sample to get a good estimate of German car costs, but it will likely not match the actual numbers exactly.


Example: Analyzing the number of muffins sold each day at a cafeteria, you sample six days at random and get these results: 38, 37, 36, 28, 18, 14, 12, 11, 10.7, 9.9. This is a sample, not a population, since you don't have data on every single day the cafeteria was open.

If you have every data point in a population, skip down to the method below instead.


, The variance of a data set tells you how spread out the data points are. The closer the variance is to zero, the more closely the data points are clustered together. When working with sample data sets, use the following formula to calculate variance:s2{\displaystyle s^{2}} = ∑/(n - 1)


s2{\displaystyle s^{2}} is the variance. Variance is always measured in squared units.


xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} represents a term in your data set.

∑, meaning ""sum,"" tells you to calculate the following terms for each value of xi{\displaystyle x_{i}}, then add them together.

x̅ is the mean of the sample.

n is the number of data points.


, The symbol x̅ or ""x-bar"" refers to the mean of a sample.Calculate this as you would any mean: add all the data points together, then divide by the number of data points.


Example: First, add your data points together: 17 + 15 + 23 + 7 + 9 + 13 = 84Next, divide your answer by the number of data points, in this case six: 84 ÷ 6 = 14.Sample mean = x̅ = 14.

You can think of the mean as the ""centre-point"" of the data. If the data clusters around the mean, variance is low. If it is spread out far from the mean, variance is high.


, Now it's time to calculate xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅, where xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} is each number in your data set. Each answer tells you that number's deviation from the mean, or in plain language, how far away it is from the mean..


Example:x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} - x̅ = 17 - 14 = 3x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} - x̅ = 15 - 14 = 1x3{\displaystyle x_{3}} - x̅ = 23 - 14 = 9x4{\displaystyle x_{4}} - x̅ = 7 - 14 = -7x5{\displaystyle x_{5}} - x̅ = 9 - 14 = -5x6{\displaystyle x_{6}} - x̅ = 13 - 14 = -1

It's easy to check your work, as your answers should add up to zero. This is due to the definition of mean, since the negative answers (distance from mean to smaller numbers) exactly cancel out the positive answers (distance from mean to larger numbers).


, As noted above, your current list of deviations (xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅) sum up to zero. This means the ""average deviation"" will always be zero as well, so that doesn't tell use anything about how spread out the data is. To solve this problem, find the square of each deviation. This will make them all positive numbers, so the negative and positive values no longer cancel out to zero.Example:(x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} - x̅)2=32=9{\displaystyle ^{2}=3^{2}=9}(x2{\displaystyle (x_{2}} - x̅)2=12=1{\displaystyle ^{2}=1^{2}=1}92 = 81(-7)2 = 49(-5)2 = 25(-1)2 = 1

You now have the value (xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} for each data point in your sample.


, Now it's time to calculate the entire numerator of the formula: ∑. The upper-case sigma, ∑, tells you to sum the value of the following term for each value of xi{\displaystyle x_{i}}. You've already calculated (xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} for each value of xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} in your sample, so all you need to do is add the results together.


Example: 9 + 1 + 81 + 49 + 25 + 1 = 166.


, A long time ago, statisticians just divided by n when calculating the variance of the sample. This gives you the average value of the squared deviation, which is a perfect match for the variance of that sample. But remember, a sample is just an estimate of a larger population. If you took another random sample and made the same calculation, you would get a different result. As it turns out, dividing by n - 1 instead of n gives you a better estimate of variance of the larger population, which is what you're really interested in. This correction is so common that it is now the accepted definition of a sample's variance.Example: There are six data points in the sample, so n = 6.Variance of the sample = s2=1666−1={\displaystyle s^{2}={\frac {166}{6-1}}=} 33.2


, Note that, since there was an exponent in the formula, variance is measured in the squared unit of the original data. This can make it difficult to understand intuitively. Instead, it's often useful to use the standard deviation. You didn't waste your effort, though, as the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. This is why the variance of a sample is written s2{\displaystyle s^{2}}, and the standard deviation of a sample is s{\displaystyle s}.

For example, the standard deviation of the sample above = s = √33.2 = 5.76.

Find the mean of the population.,
Subtract the mean from each data point.,
Square each answer.,
Find the mean of your results.,
Relate this back to the formula.",How to Calculate Variance3," The term ""population"" refers to the total set of relevant observations. For example, if you're studying the age of Texas residents, your population would include the age of every single Texas resident. You would normally create a spreadsheet for a large data set like that, but here's a smaller example data set:


Example: There are exactly six fish tanks in a room of the aquarium. The six tanks contain the following numbers of fish:x1=5{\displaystyle x_{1}=5}x2=5{\displaystyle x_{2}=5}x3=8{\displaystyle x_{3}=8}x4=12{\displaystyle x_{4}=12}x5=15{\displaystyle x_{5}=15}x6=18{\displaystyle x_{6}=18}


, Since a population contains all the data you need, this formula gives you the exact variance of the population. In order to distinguish it from sample variance (which is only an estimate), statisticians use different variables:σ2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = (∑(xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}})/n

σ2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = population variance. This is a lower-case sigma, squared. Variance is measured in squared units.


xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} represents a term in your data set.

The terms inside ∑ will be calculated for each value of xi{\displaystyle x_{i}}, then summed.

μ is the population mean

n is the number of data points in the population


, When analyzing a population, the symbol μ (""mu"") represents the arithmetic mean. To find the mean, add all the data points together, then divide by the number of data points.

You can think of the mean as the ""average,"" but be careful, as that word has multiple definitions in mathematics.


Example: mean = μ = 5+5+8+12+15+186{\displaystyle {\frac {5+5+8+12+15+18}{6}}} = 10.5


, Data points close to the mean will result in a difference closer to zero. Repeat the subtraction problem for each data point, and you might start to get a sense of how spread out the data is.


Example:x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x3{\displaystyle x_{3}} - μ = 8 - 10.5 = -2.5x4{\displaystyle x_{4}} - μ = 12 - 10.5 = 1.5x5{\displaystyle x_{5}} - μ = 15 - 10.5 = 4.5x6{\displaystyle x_{6}} - μ = 18 - 10.5 = 7.5


, Right now, some of your numbers from the last step will be negative, and some will be positive. If you picture your data on a number line, these two categories represent numbers to the left of the mean, and numbers to the right of the mean. This is no good for calculating variance, since these two groups will cancel each other out. Square each number so they are all positive instead.


Example:(xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} for each value of i from 1 to 6:(-5.5)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-5.5)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-2.5)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = 6.25(1.5)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = 2.25(4.5)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = 20.25(7.5)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} = 56.25


, Now you have a value for each data point, related (indirectly) to how far that data point is from the mean. Take the mean of these values by adding them all together, then dividing by the number of values.


Example:Variance of the population = 30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.256=145.56={\displaystyle {\frac {30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.25}{6}}={\frac {145.5}{6}}=} 24.25


, If you're not sure how this matches the formula at the beginning of this method, try writing out the whole problem in longhand:

After finding the difference from the mean and squaring, you have the value (x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}}, (x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}}, and so on up to (xn{\displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}}, where xn{\displaystyle x_{n}} is the last data point in the set.

To find the mean of these values, you sum them up and divide by n: ( (x1{\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} + (x2{\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} + ... + (xn{\displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}} ) / n

After rewriting the numerator in sigma notation, you have (∑(xi{\displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{\displaystyle ^{2}})/n, the formula for variance.

Represent probability of an impossible outcome with a 0.",How to Calculate Probability," Probability is the likelihood of one or more events happening divided by the number of possible outcomes. So, let's say you're trying to find the likelihood of rolling a three on a six-sided die. ""Rolling a three"" is the event, and since we know that a six-sided die can land any one of six numbers, the number of outcomes is six. Here are two more examples to help you get oriented:



Example 1: What is the likelihood of choosing a day that falls on the weekend when randomly picking a day of the week?

""Choosing a day that falls on the weekend"" is our event, and the number of outcomes is the total number of days in a week, seven.



Example 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If a marble is drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that this marble is red?

""Choosing a red marble"" is our event, and the number of outcomes is the total number of marbles in the jar, 20.

;
, This will give us the probability of a single event occurring. In the case of rolling a three on a die, the number of events is one (there's only one three on each die), and the number of outcomes is six. You can also think of this as 1 ÷ 6, 1/6, .166, or 16.6%. Here's how you find the probability of our remaining examples:



Example 1: What is the likelihood of choosing a day that falls on the weekend when randomly picking a day of the week?

The number of events is two (since two days out of the week are weekends), and the number of outcomes is seven. The probability is 2 ÷ 7 = 2/7 or .285 or 28.5%.



Example 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If a marble is drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that this marble is red?

The number of events is five (since there are five red marbles), and the number of outcomes is 20. The probability is 5 ÷ 20 = 1/4 or .25 or 25%.



, Calculating the probability of multiple events is a matter of breaking the problem down into separate probabilities. Here are three examples:



Example 1: What is the probability of rolling two consecutive fives on a six-sided die?

You know that the probability of rolling one five is 1/6, and the probability of rolling another five with the same die is also 1/6.
These are independent events, because what you roll the first time does not affect what happens the second time; you can roll a 3, and then roll a 3 again.



Example 2:Two cards are drawn randomly from a deck of cards. What is the likelihood that both cards are clubs?

The likelihood that the first card is a club is 13/52, or 1/4. (There are 13 clubs in every deck of cards.) Now, the likelihood that the second card is a club is 12/51.
You are measuring the probability of dependent events. This is because what you do the first time affects the second; if you draw a 3 of clubs and don't put it back, there will be one less fewer club and one less card in the deck (51 instead of 52).



Example 3: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If three marbles are drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that the first marble is red, the second marble is blue, and the third is white?

The probability that the first marble is red is 5/20, or 1/4. The probability of the second marble being blue is 4/19, since we have one fewer marble, but not one fewer blue marble. And the probability that the third marble is white is 11/18, because we've already chosen two marbles. This is another measure of a dependent event.




, This will give you the probability of multiple events occurring one after another. Here's what you can do:



Example 1:What is the probability of rolling two consecutive fives on a six-sided die? The probability of both independent events is 1/6.

This gives us 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 or .027 or 2.7%.



Example 2: Two cards are drawn randomly from a deck of cards. What is the likelihood that both cards are clubs?

The probability of the first event happening is 13/52. The probability of the second event happening is 12/51. The probability is 13/52 x 12/51 = 12/204 or 1/17 or 5.8%.



Example 3: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If three marbles are drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that the first marble is red, the second marble is blue, and the third is white?

The probability of the first event is 5/20. The probability of the second event is 4/19. And the probability of the third event is 11/18. The probability is 5/20 x 4/19 x 11/18 = 44/1368 or 3.2%.



, For example, a golfer is favorite to win at a 9/4 odds. The odds of an event is the ratio of its probability that it will occur to the probability that it will not occur.


In the example of 9:4 ratio, 9 represents the probability that the golfer will win. 4 represents the probability he will not win. Therefore, it is more likely for him to win than to lose.
Remember that in sports betting and bookmaking, odds are expressed as ""odds against,"" which means that the odds of an event happening are written first, and the odds of an events not happening come second. Although it can be confusing, it's important to know this. For the purposes of this article, we will not use odds against.

, Converting odds is pretty simple. Break the odds into two separate events, plus the number of total outcomes.


The event that the golfer will win is 9; the event that the golfer will lose is 4. The total outcomes is 9 + 4, or 13.
Now the calculation is the same as calculating the probability of a single event.

9 ÷ 13 = .692 or 69.2%. The probability of the golfer winning is 9/13.



, That means they both cannot occur at the same time.

, If you arrive at a negative number, check your calculations again.

, If the likelihood of all possible events doesn't add up to 1 or 100%, you've made a mistake because you've left out a possible event.


The likelihood of rolling a three on a six-sided die is 1/6. But the probability of rolling all five other numbers on a die is also 1/6. 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 or 1 or 100%.

, This just means that there is no chance of an event happening.

Draw a 2x2 table.,
Calculate the relative risk using the 2x2 table.,
Interpret the results of relative risk.",How to Calculate Relative Risk," A 2x2 table is the basis for many epidemiological calculations.


Before you can draw a 2x2 table yourself, you must understand the variables:

A = The number of people who both had the exposure and developed the disease
B = The number of people who had the exposure but did not develop the disease
C = The number of people who did not have the exposure but did develop the disease
D = The number of people who neither had the exposure nor developed the disease


Let's do an example 2x2 table.






A study looks at 100 smokers and 100 non-smokers, and follows them for development of lung cancer.
Right away, we can fill in part of the table. The disease is lung cancer, the exposure is smoking, the total numbers of each group is 100, and the total of all the people in the study is 200.
At the end of the study, they found that 30 of the smokers and 10 of the non-smokers developed lung cancer. Now we can fill in the rest of the table.
Since A = the number of people exposed who got the disease (i.e. smokers who got lung cancer), we know this is 30. We can calculate B simply by subtracting A from the total: 100 - 30 = 70. Similarly, C is the number of non-smokers who got lung cancer, which we know is 10, and D = 100 - 10 = 90.

;
,


The general formula for relative risk, using a 2x2 table, is:
We can calculate relative risk using our example:
Therefore, the relative risk of acquiring lung cancer with smoking is 3.

,


If the relative risk = 1, then there is no difference in risk between the two groups.
If the relative risk is less than 1, then there is less risk in the exposed group relative to the unexposed group.
If the relative risk is greater than 1 (as in the example), then there is greater risk in the exposed group relative to the unexposed group.

Gather your data.,
Organize your data in numerical order.,
Create a horizontal line.,
Mark an ""X"" above the horizontal line every time the data occurs.,
Interpret the data.",How to Make a Line Plot," Your data will be comprised of the frequency with which a certain act or event occurs within a given set of people or things. For example, let's say that 10 students in a third grade class were asked the following question: ""How many books did you read over the summer?"" Your data is the amount of books that were read by each student; it does not matter which student read how many books. What matters is how many books were read. So, let's say that these are the ten different responses for how many books were read over the summer:


5, 1, 2, 5, 8, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1;
, Organizing your data from smallest to largest can help you interpret the data and to get a better sense of the numbers and scope of numbers you are working with. Take the numbers you have for how many books were read by each student and reorganize them from smallest to largest. You can cross off each number from the first list before you write it on the second list. When you're done, check to see that you still have the same amount of numbers (10). Here is how they would look:


0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 8

, Check out your data and see what your largest and smallest data is. Your smallest number is 0 and your largest is 8, so you will have to draw a horizontal line that spans from 0 to 8. If you're working with a larger range of numbers, then you won't have to label every single number. For your purposes here, though, you can draw a horizontal line that labels the numbers from 0-8, moving from left to right. It can just look like this:


0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

, So, mark 1 X above 0 because it occurs once, mark 2 Xs above 1 because it occurs twice, mark 3 Xs above 2 because it occurs 3 times, mark 2 Xs above 5 because it occurs twice, and mark 1 X above 8 because it occurs once. Now that you have made a line plot of the frequency with which a class of 10 students read a certain amount of books, you can sit back and interpret the data.

, Now that you've organized your data in a line plot, you can sit back and look at a few key components of the data. Here is what people look for most commonly when they interpret the data in a line plot:



The most commonly occurring event. In this case, it was most common for students to read 2 books over the summer, since ""2 books"" occurs more frequently than any other set of data.

Outliers. ""8"" is an outlier because this set of data is far away from the others, and breaks the pattern of the most common amount of books read by students.

Gaps. There are gaps between ""3 books"" and ""5 books"" and ""5 books"" and ""8 books.""

Clusters. There is a cluster of data between ""1 book"" and ""2 books,"" which means that a lot of the books that were read fall within those categories.

Divide current prices by the old prices.,
Multiply the result by 100.,
Subtract 100 from the new result to find the change in CPI.",How to Calculate CPI1," Grocery receipts from the past year would work well for this purpose. For accurate calculations, use a sampling of prices based on a relatively brief period of time--perhaps just one or two months of the previous year.If you are using old receipts, make sure that they have the date on them. Simply knowing that the prices listed are not current does not illustrate any real point. The change in CPI is only relevant if calculated for a specifically quantifiable amount of time.;
, Using the record of past prices, add together a sampling of those product prices.


Normally, the CPI is restricted to some of the most commonly used consumer items--foods such as milk and eggs, and others such as laundry detergent and shampoo.
If you are using a record of your own purchases and are trying to determine the general trend in prices and not merely the change of a single item, you may want to exclude those items that are only occasional purchases.

, Again, receipts would function well for this purpose.


If you are using a relatively small sample of items, you may be able to find the prices in flyers sent out by retail stores.
It may be useful, for the sake of comparison, to make sure the prices used are based upon the same brands and from the same retailer. Because of the price differences at each store and from brand to brand, the only way to track the change of prices over time is to minimize these variables.

, You must use an identical list of items as you used when you added the prices of past items together. For example, if one loaf of bread was in your first list, one loaf of bread must be part of the list of current prices.

, For example, if the total of current prices amounted to $90 and the old prices equaled $80, the result is 1.125 (represented mathematically, 90÷80=1.125).

, The baseline for the CPI is 100--that is, the initial reference point, when compared to itself, equals 100%-- and so make your figure comparable.


Think of the CPI as a percentage. Past prices represent a baseline, and that baseline is described as 100% of itself.
Using the previous example, current prices would be 112.5% of the previous prices.

, By doing this, you are subtracting the baseline--represented by the number 100--to determine the change over time.


Again, using the above example, the result would be 12.5, representing a 12.5% change in prices from the first period to the second.
Positive results represent the rate of inflation; negative numbers reflect deflation (a rare fairly rare phenomenon in most of the world since the mid-twentieth century).

Again, the purpose of CPI is not to determine how much you are saving by shopping at a different store or switching to generic brands.


Also avoid comparing sale items. The official CPI calculated by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a large number of items found in a variety of locations in order to eliminate short-term fluctuations. Calculating the change for individual items is still worthwhile, but sales are another variable that should be eliminated.

, So, if a box of cereal once cost $2.50 but now costs $2.75, the result should be 1.1 (represented mathematically, 2.75÷2.5=1.1).

, Again, because the baseline for the CPI is 100--that is, the initial reference point, when compared to itself, equals 100%-- make your figure comparable.


Using the example, the CPI would be 110.

, In the case of the example, 110 minus 100 equals 10. That means that the price of the particular item examined has increased by 10% over time.

Simplify and reduce.",How to Add Fractions," If they are the same number, then you're dealing with fractions that have the same denominator. If not, skip to the section down below.;
, By the last step, you should understand how they were added together.

Ex. 1: 1/4 + 2/4







Ex. 2: 3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8







, The numerator is the number on top of the fraction. However many fractions you have, if they have the same bottom numbers, add up all the top numbers.


Ex. 1: 1/4 + 2/4 is our equation. ""1"" and ""2"" are the numerators. That means 1 + 2 = 3.







Ex. 2: 3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8 is our equation. ""3"" and ""2"" and ""4"" are the numerators. That means 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.







, Take the sum of the numerators you got in Step 2; that sum will be your new numerator. Take the denominator that was the same for each fraction. Don't do anything to it. This is your new denominator; it will always be the same as the old denominator when you add fractions with the same denominators.


Ex. 1: 3 is our new numerator, and 4 is our new denominator. This gives us an answer of 3/4. 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.







Ex. 2: 9 is our new numerator, and 8 is our new denominator. This gives us an answer of 9/8. 3/8 + 2/8 + 4/8 = 9/8.







, Simplify the new fraction to make sure it's written as simply as possible.

If the numerator is bigger than the denominator, like it is in Ex. 2, that means we can take out at least one whole number. Divide the top number by the bottom number. When we divide 9 by 8, we get 1 whole number and a remainder of 1. Put the whole number out in front of the fraction and the remainder in the numerator of the new fraction, leaving the denominator the same.
9/8 = 1 1/8.







, If the denominators are different numbers, then you're dealing with unlike denominators. You're going to have to find a way to make the unlike denominators be the same. This guide will help you do that.

, By the last step, you should understand how they were added together.

Ex. 3: 1/3 + 3/5







Ex. 4: 2/7 + 2/14







, Do this by finding a ""multiple"" of the two denominators. An easy way to find one is to simply multiply the two denominators together. If one of the numbers multiplies into the other numbers, you may only need to multiply one of the fractions.


Ex. 3: 3 x 5 = 15. Both of our fractions will have a denominator of 15.







Ex. 4: 14 is a multiple of 7. So all we have to do is multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Both of our fractions will have a denominator of 14.







, We're not changing the value of the fraction; we're just changing how the fraction looks. It's still the same fraction.


Ex. 3: 1/3 x 5/5 = 5/15.







Ex. 4: For this fraction, we only have to multiply the first fraction by 2, because that's what gives us our common denominator.





2/7 x 2/2 = 4/14.



, Again, we're not changing the value of the fraction; we're just changing how the fraction looks. It's still the same fraction.


Ex. 3: 3/5 x 3/3 = 9/15.







Ex. 4: We don't need to multiply the second fraction because both fractions already have their common denominators.

, We haven't added them yet, but that will come soon! What we've done is multiple each fraction by the number 1. Our goal here was to get the denominators to look exactly the same.


Ex. 3: instead of 1/3 + 3/5, we have 5/15 + 9/15







Ex. 4: instead of 2/7 + 2/14, we have 4/14 + 2/14







, The numerator is the top number of the fraction.


Ex. 3: 5 + 9 = 14. 14 will be our new numerator.







Ex. 4: 4 + 2 = 6. 6 will be our new numerator.







, Or, just keep the denominator that's on the changed fractions already — it's the same number.


Ex. 3: 15 will be our new denominator.







Ex. 4: 14 will be our new denominator.







,


Ex. 3: 14/15 is our answer to 1/3 + 3/5 = ?







Ex. 4: 6/14 is our answer to 2/7 + 2/14 = ?







, Simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator in the fraction by each number's greatest common factor.


Ex. 3: 14/15 cannot be simplified.







Ex. 4: 6/14 can be reduced to 3/7 by dividing both the top and the bottom numbers by 2, the greatest common factor.

Look at the denominators.,
Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions.,
Find the new numerator of the first fraction.,
Find the new numerator of the second fraction.,
Add the numerators of the two fractions, and place the sum over the LCD.,
Simplify your answer, if possible.",How to Add and Multiply Fractions1," The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. In order to add fractions, the denominators of the fractions have to be the same. If they are not the same, you will need to find the lowest common denominator.

The denominator tells you how many pieces make one whole.If the two fractions do not use the same denominator, then you are not adding same-sized pieces, and your answer will be incorrect.

For example, if you are adding the fractions 64{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{4}}} and 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}}, you would compare the 4 and the 3. They are different, and so you cannot add these fractions as is, because you cannot add fourths and thirds together.
;
, If the denominators are the same, you can skip this step. If the denominators are not the same, you must find the LCD. To find the LCD, you are looking for the lowest common multiple of the two denominators. A multiple is a number that results from multiplying a number by another number. One way to find the LCD is to make a list of multiples of the two denominators until you find one that matches. To learn other ways to find the LCD, read Find the Least Common Denominator.

For example, if your denominators are 4 and 3, first list multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 20...) and then list multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15…). The lowest multiple the two numbers have in common is 12, so 12 is the least common denominator.


, The numerator is the number above the fraction bar. To find the new numerator, compare the original denominator to the LCD. Determine what factor you have to multiply the original denominator by to get to the LCD. Then, multiply the numerator by this same factor.

The numerator tells you how many pieces you have.Just remember when preparing fractions for adding that whatever you do to the denominator, you must also do to the numerator.

For example, if the original denominator was 4, and the LCD is 12, you would have to multiply the original denominator by the factor 3, since 4×3=12{\displaystyle 4\times 3=12}. As such, you would then multiply the numerator by the factor 3. If the original numerator was 6, then the new numerator would be 18, since 6×3=18{\displaystyle 6\times 3=18}. So, your new fraction becomes 1812{\displaystyle {\frac {18}{12}}}.


, To do this, follow the same process you did to find the new numerator for the first fraction.

For example, if the original denominator was 3, and the LCD is 12, you would have to multiply the original denominator by the factor 4, since 3×4=12{\displaystyle 3\times 4=12}. As such, you would then multiply the numerator by the factor 4. If the original numerator was 5, then the new numerator would be 20, since 5×4=20{\displaystyle 5\times 4=20}. So, your new fraction becomes 2012{\displaystyle {\frac {20}{12}}}.


, Now that you have found the lowest common denominator, you are adding individual pieces that are the same size, so you can proceed with adding the numerators. You do NOT add the denominators, because the size of the pieces you are adding does not change, only how many of the pieces you have.

For example, if you are adding 1812+2012{\displaystyle {\frac {18}{12}}+{\frac {20}{12}}}, you will add the numerators 18 and 20. 18+20=38{\displaystyle 18+20=38}. Then, you will place 38 over the LCD, which is 12. So the sum is 3812{\displaystyle {\frac {38}{12}}}.


, Usually you will be asked to reduce, or simplify a final answer if it is a fraction. To simplify, find the highest number that will divide evenly into the numerator and denominator,then divide the numerator and denominators by that number.

For example, if your answer is 3812{\displaystyle {\frac {38}{12}}}, divide the numerator and denominator by 2. 38/2=19{\displaystyle 38/2=19} and 12/2=6{\displaystyle 12/2=6}, so the simplified fraction is 196{\displaystyle {\frac {19}{6}}}. Since 19 cannot be divided evenly by any other number, you cannot simplify 196{\displaystyle {\frac {19}{6}}}any further.

Understand how to use an exponent shortcut.",How to Square Fractions," When you see an exponent of two, you know that you need to square the number. To square a whole number, you multiply it by itself.For example:


52 = 5 × 5 = 25;
, To square a fraction, you multiply the fraction by itself. Another way to think about it is to multiply the numerator by itself and then the denominator by itself.For example:


(5/2)2 = 5/2 × 5/2 or (52/22).
Squaring each number yields (25/4).

, The actual order that you multiply these numbers by themselves doesn’t matter as long as you have squared both numbers. To keep things simple, start with the numerator: simply multiply it by itself. Then, multiply the denominator by itself.


The numerator will stay on top of the fraction and the denominator will stay at the bottom of the fraction.
For example: (5/2)2 = (5 x 5/2 x 2) = (25/4).

, When working with fractions, the last step is always to reduce the fraction to its most simple form or turn the improper fraction into a mixed number.For our example, 25/4 is an improper fraction because the numerator is larger than the denominator.


To convert to a mixed number, divide 4 into 25. It goes in 6 times (6 x 4 = 24) with 1 leftover. Therefore, the mixed number is 6 1/4.

, If you are working with a negative fraction, it will have a minus sign in front of it. It is good practice to always put parentheses around a negative number so you know that the “–“ sign is referring to the number and not telling you to subtract two numbers.For example: (–2/4)

, Square the fraction as you would normally by multiplying the numerator by itself and then multiplying the denominator by itself. Alternatively, you can simply multiply the fraction by itself.


For example: (–2/4)2 = (–2/4) x (–2/4)

, When a minus sign is present, the entire fraction is negative. When you square the fraction, you are multiplying two negative numbers together. Whenever two negative numbers are multiplied together, they make a positive number.For example: (-2) x (-8) = (+16)

, After you have squared the fraction, you will have multiplied two negative numbers together. This means that the squared fraction will be positive. Be sure to write your final answer without the negative sign.Continuing the example, the resulting fraction will be a positive number.
(–2/4) x (–2/4) = (+4/16)
Generally, the convention is to drop the “+” sign for positive numbers., The final step when doing any calculations with a fraction is to reduce it. Improper fractions must first be simplified into mixed numbers and then reduced.


For example: (4/16) has a common factor of four.
Divide the fraction through by 4: 4/4 = 1, 16/4= 4
Rewrite simplified fraction: (1/4)

, It is usually easier to reduce fractions before squaring them. Remember, to reduce a fraction means to divide it by a common factor until the number one is the only number that can be evenly divided into both the numerator and denominator.Reducing the fraction first means you don’t have to reduce it at the end when the numbers will be larger.


For example: (12/16)2

12 and 16 can both be divided by 4. 12/4 = 3 and 16/4 = 4; therefore, 12/16 reduces to 3/4.
Now, you will square the fraction 3/4.
(3/4)2 = 9/16, which cannot be reduced.
To prove this, let’s square the original fraction without reducing:

(12/16)2 = (12 x 12/16 x 16) = (144/256)
(144/256) has a common factor of 16. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 16 reduces the fraction to (9/16), the same fraction we got from reducing first.



, When working with more complex equations, you may be able to simply cancel one of the factors. In this case, it is actually easier to wait before you reduce the fraction. Adding an additional factor to the above example illustrates this.


For example: 16 × (12/16)2

Expand out the square and cross out the common factor of 16: 16 * 12/16 * 12/16
Because there is one 16 whole number and two 16’s in the denominator, you can cross ONE of them out.


Rewrite the simplified equation: 12 × 12/16

Reduce 12/16 by dividing through by 4: 3/4

Multiply: 12 × 3/4 = 36/4
Divide: 36/4 = 9

, Another way to solve the same example is to simplify the exponent first. The end result is the same, it’s just a different way to solve.


For example: 16 * (12/16)2

Rewrite with the numerator and denominator squared: 16 * (122/162)
Cancel out the exponent in the denominator: 16 * 122/162
Imagine the first 16 has an exponent of 1: 161. Using the exponent rule of dividing numbers, you subtract the exponents. 161/162, yields 161-2 = 16-1 or 1/16.


Now, you are working with: 122/16

Rewrite and reduce the fraction: 12*12/16 = 12 * 3/4.
Multiply: 12 × 3/4 = 36/4
Divide: 36/4 = 9

Collect and count your data.,
Find the sum of the data values.,
Divide to find the mean.,
Set up a table.,
Calculate the deviation of each data point.,
Find the absolute value of each deviation.,
Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations.,
Interpret the result.",How to Calculate Mean Deviation About Mean (for Ungrouped Data)," For any set of data values, the mean is a measure of central value. Depending on the type of data, the mean tells you the central value of that data. To find the mean, you must first collect your data, either through an experiment of some sort or just from an assigned problem.For this example, use the assigned data set of 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 4, 8 and 12. This set is small enough to count by hand to find that there are eight numbers in the set.

In statistical work, the variable N{\displaystyle N} or n{\displaystyle n} is commonly used to represent the number of data values.
;
, The first step of finding the mean is calculating the sum of all the data points. In statistical notation, each value is generally represented by the variable x{\displaystyle x}. The sum of all values is symbolized as Σx{\displaystyle \Sigma x}. The capital Greek letter sigma signifies finding the sum of the values. For this sample data set, the calculation is:Σx=6+7+10+12+13+4+8+12=72{\displaystyle \Sigma x=6+7+10+12+13+4+8+12=72}


, Finally, divide the sum by the number of values. The Greek letter mu, μ{\displaystyle \mu }, is commonly used to represent the mean. Therefore, the calculation of the mean is:μ=ΣxN=728=9{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\Sigma x}{N}}={\frac {72}{8}}=9}


, To keep your data in good order and to help with the calculations, it is helpful to create a three-column table. Label the first column x{\displaystyle x}. Label  the second column x−μ{\displaystyle x-\mu }. Label the third column |x−μ|{\displaystyle |x-\mu |}.Fill the first column with the data points for your calculation.


, In the second column, which you have labeled x−μ{\displaystyle x-\mu }, you will report the deviation or difference between each data point and the mean of the set. Find this value simply by subtracting the mean from each data value.For the sample data set, these deviations will be:


6−9=−3{\displaystyle 6-9=-3}


7−9=−2{\displaystyle 7-9=-2}


10−9=1{\displaystyle 10-9=1}


12−9=3{\displaystyle 12-9=3}


13−9=4{\displaystyle 13-9=4}


4−9=−5{\displaystyle 4-9=-5}


8−9=−1{\displaystyle 8-9=-1}


12−9=3{\displaystyle 12-9=3}



To check the validity of your calculations, the sum of the values in this deviation column should be 0. If you add them up and get something other than 0, then either your mean is incorrect or you made an error in calculating one or more of the deviations. Go back and check your work. 


, When you calculate the deviation of each data point from the mean, you are concerned only with the size of the difference, and not whether the difference is positive or negative. What you really need, then, in mathematical terminology, is the absolute value of the difference. Absolute value is designated symbolically with the vertical bars |  |.Absolute value is a mathematical tool used to measure distance or size, regardless of direction.

To find absolute value, just drop the negative sign from each number in the second column. Thus, fill the third column with the absolute values as follows:


x.....(x−μ).....|(x−μ)|{\displaystyle x.....(x-\mu ).....|(x-\mu )|}


6..........−3..........3{\displaystyle 6..........-3..........3}


7..........−2..........2{\displaystyle 7..........-2..........2}


10..........1..........1{\displaystyle 10..........1..........1}


12..........3..........3{\displaystyle 12..........3..........3}


13..........4..........4{\displaystyle 13..........4..........4}


4..........−5..........5{\displaystyle 4..........-5..........5}


8..........−1..........1{\displaystyle 8..........-1..........1}


12..........3..........3{\displaystyle 12..........3..........3}


, After completing your three-column table, find the mean of the absolute values in the third column. As you did to find the mean of the original data points, add the deviations together and divide the sum by the number of values.For this data set, this final calculation will be:


3+2+1+3+4+5+1+38=228=2.75{\displaystyle {\frac {3+2+1+3+4+5+1+3}{8}}={\frac {22}{8}}=2.75}




, The value of the mean deviation about the mean is a measure of how closely grouped your data values are. It answers the question, “How close to the mean, on average, are the data values?” For example, with this data set, you can say that the the mean is 9 and the average distance from that mean is 2.75. Note that some numbers are closer than 2.75 and some are farther. But that is the average distance.

Multiply the numerators.,
Multiply the denominators.,
Write your new product.,
Simplify your answer, if possible.",How to Add and Multiply Fractions2," This will give you the numerator of the product. The numerators are the numbers above the fraction bar.

The product is the answer to a multiplication problem.

Unlike when adding fractions, multiplying fractions does not require having a least common denominator. This is because when taking a part of a fraction, you are changing the number of pieces in the whole.  

For example, if you are multiplying 52{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{2}}} and 312{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{12}}}, the numerator of your answer (product) will be 15, since 5×3=15{\displaystyle 5\times 3=15}.


, This will give you the denominator of the product. The denominators are the numbers below the fraction bar.

For example, if you are multiplying 52{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{2}}} and 312{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{12}}}, the denominator of your product will be 24, since 2×12=24{\displaystyle 2\times 12=24}.


, To get the product of the two fractions, simply put together the numerator and denominator you found by multiplying.

For example, if you found the numerator by multiplying 5×3{\displaystyle 5\times 3} and the denominator by multiplying 2×12{\displaystyle 2\times 12}, your answer (product) is 1524{\displaystyle {\frac {15}{24}}}.


, Usually you will be asked to reduce, or simplify a final answer if it is a fraction. To simplify, find the highest number that will divide evenly into the numerator and denominator,then divide the numerator and denominators by that number.

For example, if your answer is 1524{\displaystyle {\frac {15}{24}}}, you can divide the numerator and denominator evenly by 3. 15/3=5{\displaystyle 15/3=5} and 24/3=8{\displaystyle 24/3=8}, so the simplified fraction is 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}. Since 5 cannot be divided evenly by any other number, you cannot simplify 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} any further.

Get additional help with reducing fractions.",How to Divide Fractions by Fractions," The problem 2 ÷ 1/2 is asking you: ”How many halves are in 2?” The answer is 4, because each unit (1) is made up of two halves, and there are 2 units total: 2 halves/1 unit * 2 units = 4 halves.


Try thinking about this same equation in terms of cups of water: How many half cups of water are in 2 cups of water? You could pour 2 half cups of water into each cup of water which means you are basically adding them, and you have two cups: 2 halves/1 cup * 2 cups = 4 halves.
All of this means that when the fraction you are dividing by is between 0 and 1, the answer will always be larger than the original number! This is true whether you are dividing whole numbers or fractions by a fraction.;
, Therefore, dividing by a fraction can be accomplished by multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of a fraction (also called its “multiplicative inverse”) is just the fraction turned upside down, so that the numerator and denominator have switched places.In a moment, we are going to divide fractions by fractions by finding the reciprocal of the second fraction and multiplying them together, but let’s look at some reciprocals first:


The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.
The reciprocal of 7/5 is 5/7.
The reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1, or 2.

, In order, the steps are:


Leave the first fraction in the equation alone.
Turn the division sign into a multiplication sign.
Flip the second fraction over (find its reciprocal).
Multiply the numerators (top numbers) of the two fractions together. This result will be the numerator (top portion) of your answer. Multiply the denominators (bottom numbers) of the two fractions together. The result will be the denominator of your answer.
Simplify your fraction by reducing it to the simplest terms.

, We will begin by leaving the first fraction alone, and changing the division sign to a multiplication sign:



1/3 ÷ 2/5 = becomes:
1/3 * __ =
Now we flip the second fraction (2/5) over to find its reciprocal, 5/2:
1/3 * 5/2 =
Now multiply the numerators (top numbers) of the two fractions, 1*5 = 5.
1/3 * 5/2 = 5/
Now multiply the denominators (bottom numbers) of the two fractions, 3*2 = 6.
We now have: 1/3 * 5/2 = 5/6

This particular fraction cannot be simplified further, so we have our answer.

, And don't forget to simplify, Before it's time to say goodbye."" Another helpful saying that tells you what to do with each part of the equation is: “Leave Me (the first fraction), Change Me (the division symbol), Turn Me Over (the second fraction).”

, Let’s use 2/3 ÷ 3/7. This question is asking us how many parts equal to 3/7 of a whole can be found in the value 2/3. Don’t worry; it’s not as hard as it sounds!

, Your new equation should read: 2/3 * __ (we’ll fill in the blank in a moment.)

, This means flipping 3/7 over so that the numerator (3) is now on the bottom, and the denominator (7) is now on the top. The reciprocal of 3/7 is 7/3. Now write out your new equation:


2/3 * 7/3 = __

, First multiply the numerators of the two fractions together: 2 * 7 = 14. 14 is the numerator (top value) of your answer. Then multiply the denominators of the two fractions together: 3 * 3 = 9. 9 is the denominator (bottom value) of your answer. You now know that 2/3 * 7/3 = 14/9.

, In this case, because the numerator of the fraction is larger than the denominator, we know that our fraction is larger than 1, and we should convert it to a mixed fraction. (A mixed fraction is a whole number and a fraction combined, like 1 2/3.)


First divide the numerator 14 by 9. 9 goes into 14 one time, with a remainder of 5, so you should write out your reduced fraction out as: 1 5/9 (“one and five ninths”).
Stop there, you have found your answer! You can determine that you cannot reduce the fraction further because the denominator is not evenly divisible by the numerator (9 cannot be divided evenly by 5) and the numerator is a prime number, or an integer that can only be divisible by one and itself., Let’s try the problem 4/5 ÷ 2/6 =. First change the division sign to a multiplication sign (4/5 * __ = ), then find the reciprocal of 2/6, which is 6/2. You know have the equation: 4/5 * 6/2 =__. Now multiply the numerators, 4 * 6 = 24, and the denominators 5* 2 = 10. You now have4/5 * 6/2 = 24/10. Now simplify the fraction. Because the numerator is larger than the denominator, we will need to convert this to a mixed fraction.


First divide the numerator by the denominator, (24/10 = 2 remainder 4).
Write the answer out as 2 4/10. We could still reduce this fraction further!
Note that 4 and 10 are both even numbers, so the first step in reducing them is to divide them each by 2. We end up with 2/5.
Because the denominator (5) cannot be divided evenly by the numerator (2), and it is a prime number, we know that it cannot be reduced further. Our answer is thus: 2 2/5.

, You probably spent a lot of time learning to reduce fractions before trying to divide them by each other, but if you need a refresher or some more help, there are some great articles online that can help you a lot. "

Take care of the nib.",How to Use a Fountain Pen," Remove the lid from the pen and hold it in your dominant hand, pinching it gently between your thumb and index finger. The barrel should rest against your middle finger. Rest your other fingers on the paper to stabilize your hand.It’s important to hold a fountain pen properly, because this will prevent your hands from getting tired as you write, and it will facilitate the writing process.
When you write, you can either post the cap on the back of the pen, or remove it completely if you have small hands.;
, This may sound simple, but because of the construction of a fountain pen, this is more complicated than with a ballpoint pen. Because a fountain pen has a pointed nib rather than a rounded end, you must position the nib on the paper properly in order to write, and this is called the sweet spot.


Angle the pen at a 45-degree angle and place the nib against the paper.Make a few strokes with the pen, rotating the pen slightly in your hand as necessary until you find the spot where the pen writes smoothly and without scratching or skipping., When writing, there are two ways you can control the pen: with your fingers or with your hand. With a ballpoint pen, you can get away with controlling the pen with your fingers rather than your hand, because the rounded tip means you'll always be able to write. But with a fountain pen, you need to control the pen with your hand so you don’t lose the sweet spot. To do this:Hold the pen in your hand and keep your fingers and wrist rigid as you move your arm and shoulder to move the pen. Practice a few strokes in the air first, and then start making a few strokes against a piece of paper until you get the feel for writing with your hand.

, You don’t need to press hard with a fountain pen, but you do need to apply the nib to the paper with some pressure in order to draw up the ink. Gently press the pen into the paper and begin practicing writing with the fountain pen.Use light strokes as you write, because pressing too hard can damage the nib and disrupt the ink flow.Writing with your hand instead of your fingers will also help ensure that you don’t apply too much pressure.

, There are three types of fountain pens on the market today: cartridge, converter, and piston. The different types refer to the different ink delivery methods, and the method will determine how you refill your pen when the ink runs out.Cartridge pens are the most common today, and they are the easiest to refill. To write with this type of pen, you simply purchase pre-filled ink cartridges, so when one runs out, all you do is replace the cartridge.
Converter cartridges are reusable cartridges that get inserted into a cartridge pen. These are great for people who don’t mind refilling the ink and don’t want to throw away a cartridge every time the ink runs out.
Piston pens are similar to converter cartridges, but the pen comes with its own built-in refilling system, so you don’t have to replace the reusable cartridge with a separately purchased converter.

, Unscrew the cap from the pen, and then unscrew the barrel (the body) from the nib. Remove the empty ink cartridge. With your new ink cartridge:Insert the small end inside the nib.
Push the cartridge onto the nipple until it clicks, which occurs when the inside of the nib punctures the cartridge to access the ink.
If the pen won’t write immediately, sit it in a vertical position to allow gravity to pull the ink down into the nib. This can take about an hour., Remove the cap from the nib, and, if necessary, the cap off the back of the pen that covers the end knob. Twist the knob (most likely in a counter-clockwise direction) to extend the piston toward the front of the pen. When that’s done:Dip the entire nib into an ink jar, making sure to cover the hole on the back of the nib.
Turn the piston knob in a clockwise direction to draw ink into the chamber.
When the chamber is full, pull the pen out of the ink. Turn the piston in a counter-clockwise direction again and let a few drops of ink back into the bottle. This will help remove air bubbles.
Clean the nib with a cloth to remove any excess ink.

, Converters work in one of two ways, either with a piston mechanism or an air-bladder mechanism (also called squeeze converters). To refill an air-bladder pen, dip the nib into the ink bottle and: Slowly press the converter at the back of the pen, and wait for air bubbles to appear in the ink.
Slowly release the converter and wait for the ink to be drawn into the chamber.
Repeat until the chamber is full.

, There are many different types of fountain pen nibs, and they are appropriate for different situations and to create different effects. For everyday writing, opt for:A round nib, which is great for making uniform lines
A small nib, which will create thinner lines
A firm nib that doesn’t have a lot of flex between the two tines, so the tines won’t spread out under pressure to create a broader stroke

, To write in cursive, italics, or calligraphy, you won’t use the same nib as you would for everyday writing. Instead, look for:Stub and italic nibs, which are wider and flatter than round nibs. These are able to create both wide and narrow strokes, because vertical strokes will be as wide as the nib and horizontal strokes will be as thin.
A wider nib, which will create wider strokes. Nibs typically come in five sizes: extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, and double broad.
A flexible or semi-flexible nib, which allows you to control how narrow or broad a stroke will be by applying more or less pressure.

, Fountain pen nibs are also available in a variety of different metals, and each of these has unique properties. The most common metals for nibs are:Gold, which has lots of flexibility, so you can control the width of the stroke
Steel, which has more spring, meaning you can press harder without separating the tines, so your stroke won’t get broader when you press harder

, For the best performance from your fountain pen, you should flush the pen and nib every six weeks or so, or any time you change the ink type or color. To flush the pen:Unscrew the cap, then unscrew the nib to remove it from the pen. Remove the ink cartridge. If there's still ink in there, put a piece of tape over the opening to keep the ink from drying out.
Hold the nib under room-temperature running water to flush out ink. Then place the nib in a bowl of clean water, nib-down. As the water becomes inky, replace it with clean water. Repeat until the water remains clear.
Wrap the nip in a piece of soft and lint-free cloth, such as microfiber. Place it nib-down in a cup and let it dry for 12 to 24 hours. When it’s dry, you can reassemble the pen.

, To keep the nib from becoming clogged, always store the pen nib-up when you aren't using it. To prevent damage to the nip and scratching to the pen, store the pen in a protective case."

, Drill enough so that the brass tube has been cut to reveal clean shiny brass.

, Bushings are also available for most pen kits to aid in turning the pen to the correct outside diameter. Any means of holding the brass tube on the lathe will suffice; here the tube is held in place between centres by two pieces of steel bar stepped down in diameter so that they enter the brass tube and support it on their shoulders. The two images show the difference between sanded (600 grit) and polished finishes.

Pour about one cup of warm water into a bowl.,
Put the marker(s) tip-down in the water.,
Let the markers dry on a rag.,
Replace the caps when done.,
Alternatively, use a few drops of vinegar.,
Consider injecting water into the marker.",How to Revive Dried Out Markers1," If you have one or more dried-out water-based markers, try this simple trick to breathe some life back into them. Start by filling a small bowl with warm or hot water. In the next step, this water will soak into the markers' dried-out tips, which will usually allow the ink to begin flowing freely once more.


Note that it's not essential to use warm or hot water — cold water will also work. However, since ink diffuses more quickly in higher-temperature water, this usually works faster.;
, Take the caps off of your dry markers and dip them in the water so that the tips are completely submerged. Let the markers soak undisturbed for about five minutes. You may notice some ink draining out of the marker tips and into the water — this is normal.


As noted above, this method is only advised for water-based markers. If you're not sure whether your markers are water-based or not, check the packaging (if it's available). As a very general rule, water-based markers are used for drawing and coloring and are marketed to children, though there are exceptions (such as high-quality markers marketed to grown-up artists)., Remove your markers from the water. Dab the tips with a rag to remove excess water, then lay the markers on the rag to dry. You want the markers to dry to the point that the ink in their tips is no longer diluted with water, but not so dry that they won't write.


The time this takes can vary and often takes up to 24 hours.Your best bet is to check on the markers by scribbling on a sheet of paper every few hours to test their writing ability.
Note that this process will probably get a little ink onto your towel or rag. Even though this ink is water-based, it can cause stains that are difficult to remove, so you'll probably want to use an old, worn-out rag that you don't mind staining.

, Once your markers are writing properly again, be sure to replace their caps. Leaving a marker's cap off is a sure-fire way to find yourself with another dried-out marker. On the other hand, capping your markers between uses helps hold the moisture in the tip, ensuring the marker writes for as long as possible.


If you've lost your marker's tip, don't worry — you can use a small square of plastic wrap and a rubber band as a temporary solution. It's also possible to make a more durable slip-on cap by wrapping a piece of tape around the marker tip (sticky side out), then wrapping another piece of tape on top of the first (sticky side in).

, Another home remedy for dried out water-based markers involves using vinegar. With this method, you'll want to put your markers tip-down in a dry bowl and dampen each marker's tip with one or two drops of clear white vinegar. Allow the markers to soak for several minutes before drying as above. Don't submerge the marker tips as you would when using water — you just want a few drops for each.


To transfer just a drop or two to each marker tip, try filling the vinegar bottle's cap, then using a small stick (like a barbecue skewer) or an eye dropper to add vinegar to each marker drop-by-drop.

, One final way to get your markers back in shape requires a long, sharp, skinny needle (like a hypodermic syringe). For this method, fill your syringe with water, then insert the needle directly through the tip into the body of the marker. Push a small amount of water into the marker very slowly, allowing air to drain out through the tip as you add water. Once you've added no more than a milliliter (mL/cc) or so, let the marker rest on an old rag briefly to dry before using (as directed above).

Sanding will complete the work on the lathe.",How to Turn a Twist Turn Pen on a Lathe2,",, Depending upon the material you may want work your way from 150 to 600 grit sandpaper. A light touch is best. Alternate between sanding with the lathe on and then sanding lengthwise while the lathe is off. When sanding acrylics, you will find that a little water will aid in the process - just use care while working with water around electrical devices.

Once both barrels have been turned from their square form to round and are complete, the parts can be assembled to make the pen.,
The front of the pen is pressed into the front end of the lower barrel.,
After the front of the pen is pressed fully into the barrel, the twist mechanism can be pushed into the rear of the same barrel to the point indicated by the arrow.,
The brass ring can be placed on the twist mechanism before it is compressed into the barrel to the point where the indented ring meets the rear of the front or lower barrel.,
It should now be possible to push the rear barrel onto the twist mechanism by hand to give you an idea of what your final pen will look like.,
With the upper barrel removed from the twist mechanism, it is time to assemble the top of the pen.,

",How to Turn a Twist Turn Pen on a Lathe3," The diagram that comes with the pen parts describes the sequence of assembly. All of the components are squeezed together. You will need a vice with wooden jaws or a clamp with soft jaws to avoid damaging the parts of the pen.

, The only indication of which is the front before these are pressed together is the grain or pattern that runs through the two barrel parts. This is where you get to choose which end of the pen will be held and viewed more frequently.

, If in doubt, compress the components together only a little at a time and check the depth my screwing the ink refill into this component until it twists to expose the writing tip. The depth that the twist mechanism is compressed to will determine how far the writing tip protrudes when the pen is in use. DO NOT compress the parts together with the ink refill in place as this will almost certainly destroy the refill.

, The brass ring has an interference fit on the rear of the twist mechanism that prevents it from falling off when the two final parts of the pen are separated.

Secure the marker to the end of a long string.,
Swing the marker around your head like a lasso.,
Alternatively, turn the tip around with pliers.,
As a last resort, try buying refill ink.",How to Revive Dried Out Markers2," Dry erase markers don't use the same type of water-based ink as ordinary ""coloring"" markers, so reviving them by moistening their tips usually won't work. Instead, try making the most of the ink that's trapped inside the marker itself. To start, tie a long string around the body of the dried-out marker. Secure it to the string with sturdy tape.In the next step, you'll use the power of centrifugal force to force ink into the dried-out tip of the marker. Centrifugal force is basically the idea that objects being swung in a circle experience a force that pushes them ""outward"" — that is, away from the center of the circle.In this case, the outward-pushing force will move any remaining ink from the body of the marker into the tip.

, First, check to make sure the cap is on securely and completely encompasses the tip: if the cap has openings, ink may fly out and splatter the room. Carefully take the length of string in your hand and swing the marker in a circular arc over your head (like a lasso). The tip of the marker should be facing out, not in. Centrifugal force will begin to push the ink in the marker toward the tip. Do this for about a minute or two before testing your marker.


Make sure you have plenty of room around you free from obstructions before you start swinging the marker. Though you're very unlikely to cause serious injury by swinging a marker around, you can still break your marker or hurt someone if you accidentally swing the marker into his or her eye, so err on the side of safety.

, If you can't get your marker to write after using the lasso method above, grab a pair of pliers and try this method. Grip the soft fabric tip of the dry-erase marker with your pliers and pull directly outward. For many markers, the tip should come out without too much effort.Once it's out, if there's a similar soft fabric end on the other side of the tip, try flipping the tip around and replacing it. The marker should be able to write immediately. As ink soaks through the previously dry end of the tip, you can remove the tip again and flip it back around if you wish.


You may want to wear gloves and protect your work area with an old rag while attempting this method. Though unlikely, it's possible to spill ink out of the marker once you remove the tip, so having some protection against difficult-to-remove stains is a wise idea.

, While effective, the methods above will only work if ink remains inside the marker. For dry-erase markers that are completely dry — that is, both the tip and the inside of the marker are dried out — you may need to buy replacement ink.


Refill dry-erase ink can usually be purchased from office supply stores or specialty online retailers. Usually, dry-erase is quite cheap —sometimes as low for $1.00 for a small canister of ink."

Soak the dry marker tips in rubbing alcohol.,
Let the markers dry with their caps on.,
Consider using the leftover alcohol as ink.,
Alternatively, inject alcohol or acetone into the marker.",How to Revive Dried Out Markers3," For most permanent markers (like Sharpies, etc.) with dried out tips, you can get the marker writing again with a trick that's similar to the water-soaking method for water-based markers above. For this method, start by filling a small container with rubbing alcohol — for instance, you may want to use the cap of the bottle of rubbing alcohol.You don't need very much rubbing alcohol — just enough to submerge the tip of your marker (or markers). Filling an entire bowl with rubbing alcohol (as you'd do with water for water-based markers) may be wasteful.

, After soaking your markers for a few minutes in rubbing alcohol, you should notice a small amount of ink swirling around in the liquid. Remove the markers from the alcohol and replace their caps. Place them tip-side up in a glass or mug and let them rest for about 24-48 hours. After this resting period, if ink remains in the markers, they should write well once again.


Rubbing alcohol evaporates very quickly compared to water, so you won't want to let the markers rest with their caps off as you would after soaking water-based markers.If you do, they'll quickly dry out again.

, If the alcohol you soaked your marker tips in absorbed some of the ink from your permanent markers, you may want to try using it as a form of ink or dye in you own art projects. Alcohol-based inks are quite effective at dying materials like metal that other inks can be ineffective on. For instance, to make custom-colored staples, simply soak the staples in leftover alcohol that you used to moisten colored permanent markers' tips.

, Like with water-based markers, you can sometimes get new life out of a dried-out permanent marker by injecting moisture directly into it. However, in this case, you won't want to use water, but instead your marker's ink solvent. Usually, this is isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) or acetone (the active ingredient in nail polish remover), so simply inject a milliliter or so of one of these chemicals into the body of the marker as you would with water above.


Try checking your markers' packaging for a list of ingredients if you're not sure what sort of liquid solvent your ink uses.

Sharpen a carpenter’s pencil.",How to Sharpen a Pencil With a Knife," Your everyday #2 graphite pencil can be sharpened just as well as any other. The most notorious knife-wielding pencil sharpeners are artists who draw with pencils that are very similar to these standard pencils, with different hardness ratings for the graphite core.


The higher the graphite rating, the harder the graphite core, and the lighter the mark made by a pencil applied with a constant pressure.;
, A very shape knife is the best tool there is for sharpening pencils.Believe it or not, there are knives designed specifically to sharpen pencils.However, even a standard pen knife will do. You can also use a knife with a fixed blade, a utility knife, or a razor blade that fits into a handle, such as an X-Acto knife.The important thing is that the blade is very sharp. Regardless of the knife you choose, make sure it is sharp enough to easily cut through the wood of a pencil.

, Hold the pencil with your non-dominant hand with the writing tip pointed away from you. (If you are right-handed, hold the pencil in your left hand.) Grip the pencil with only enough protruding from your hand to allow you to sharpen the tip – probably about 2 inches.

, Use your dominant hand to hold the knife. Hold the handle horizontally in your palm, with the blade coming out of the thumb-side of your grip and the sharp edge of the blade on the pencil.


Always point the blade away from you, with only the end of the pencil you wish to sharpen in front of the sharp edge. Don’t ever push or pull the blade towards your fingers. Don’t ever pull the blade towards your body.

, Place the sharp edge of the blade against the pencil about an inch above the lead. Hold the knife so that the blade is horizontal to the pencil, but tilted back so that the back side of the blade is closer to you.

, Use the thumb on the hand that is holding the pencil to push the blade through the wood. Reduce the pressure on the blade as it meets the marking core. Do not force the blade with the knife hand at any point. Rotate the pencil slowly and consistently with each stroke of the blade. Maintain the angle of the blade throughout the cut.


Use both thumbs to push on the back of the blade if you need to. When using two thumbs, push especially slowly and with particular care.
The strips of wood should be thin enough to ribbon or curl as they seperate from the pencil.

, Try to move the pencil forward after you complete a cut, as opposed to moving the blade backward. This may feel more comfortable. In between cuts, reposition the knife and pencil relative to one another however you’d like, but do so in a consistent manner. Place the blade the same distance from the tip as the previous cut.

, You want a very long point that tapers from the beginning of your cuts to a very sharp point at the very tip of the marking material. The longer the taper is, the stronger the tip.Remember, the shallower the angle of the blade, the longer the taper.

, If you have reduced pressure as you reached the writing core, the tip of the pencil will need a bit of touch up to complete a smooth taper. Hold the blade horizontal to the pencil, but vertically. Brush against the pencil tip very lightly, rotating with each stroke.

, As described above, remove the wood first, rotating as you cut off consistently-sized pieces of wood, and leaving the rod of charcoal intact and exposed. When you have at least a ½ inch of charcoal exposed, sand the charcoal to a sharpened point. Use a sanding block, and rub the pencil against it at a consistent angle. Choose whichever angle you prefer, but hold the angle consistently. Use a shallow angle for a sharper tip. Sand very lightly, as charcoal is especially fragile. Rotate the pencil as you’re sanding for a smooth, sharp tip., Perfect your technique by practicing. Sharpen multiple pencils in slightly different techniques. This will give you practice, as well as differently-shaped tips that you can use for different types writing or drawing., A carpenter’s pencil has a wide, rectangular shaft that cannot be sharpened with a traditional pencil sharpener. It is harder to rotate as you remove strips of wood, though a conical tip is unnecessary (and impossible) given these pencils’ shape and strength. To sharpen a carpenter’s pencil:Use a utility knife to remove wood starting roughly ¾ inch from the end you want to sharpen.
Push the blade through the wood with the thumb of the hand holding the pencil.
Use your knife hand to maintain a consistent blade angle.
Don’t worry as much about precision and consistency with carpenter’s pencils. Both the wood and the graphite core are thicker than in other pencils, and they can handle some variability in your stroke.

Try using an electric pencil sharpener.,
Use a portable, manual sharpener.",How to Sharpen a Pencil1," An electrical pencil sharpener will create a pencil that makes a very neat line. Push the pencil into the hole in the sharpener. The sharpener will make a whirring sound as it sharpens the pencil.A downside of electric pencil sharpeners can be irregular sharpening. However, they are the easiest to use. Choose a pencil that is worth sharpening. The pencil’s lead (the graphite core) should not be off-center or it will be hard to shape into the normal conical point shape. Make sure the pencil is not bowed.
Use an old rag in order to wipe the residue off the pencil after you sharpen it.;
, These usually come with two holes in a small plastic square. One hole is for a smaller pencil, and one is for a larger one.

The benefit of using a manual sharpener is that they are cheap and portable. Again, if you’re not careful, you can create an irregular pencil point.
Simply put the pencil into the sharpener’s hole, and turn it several times to create a point. Sharpen over a garbage can, unless the sharpener has a plastic bubble designed to capture the shaving remnants.

Bottle the ink.",How to Make Ink from Tea," For this process, you are going to need black tea, water, and a thickening agent (either gum arabic or cornstarch). Some recipes also call for vinegar, which can make your ink a bit more uniform in color. You will also need a few measuring spoons, a metal or wooden spoon, a strainer (if using loose tea), and a ceramic bowl. Finally, if you intend to bottle your ink, you’ll need a small glass bottle with a screw-top lid.


Gum arabic can be found at most craft stores.
Everything else may be found at a grocery store.;
, If your black tea is in mesh tea bags, you are going to use 4 of them. If you are using loose-leaf tea, you will need about 2 tbsp. Place the measured tea into a large ceramic bowl., For this recipe, you will need ½ to ¾ cups of boiling water. Place your water on the stove, or use an electric kettle to heat your water to boiling. It is a good idea to measure your water before heating it up, that way you reduce the risk of scalding yourself.

, Take your boiling water (which has already been measured) and pour it carefully over your tea bags or tea leaves in the ceramic bowl.

, Using your wooden or metal spoon, swirl the boiling water with the tea leaves. This helps to evenly distribute the water and tea to create an even ink tone.

, As this is only a preliminary “steep” before adding thickening agents (or other ingredients), you only need to allow 3-4 minutes of steeping. You want the tea to darken a bit, but you need the water to still be hot when you add the next ingredient. You may want to keep your water on low heat during this step., In order for your tea to be transformed into usable ink, you need to thicken the liquid. There are two schools of thought when it comes to thickening agents. Gum arabic is the more popular choice for ink recipes, although it may be harder for you to find. Another option is cornstarch, which may be slightly less effective, but you may have it in your cupboard at home., If you have elected to use gum arabic, using your measuring spoon, measure out 1 tsp. of gum arabic. Add this to your hot water and stir to combine., If you have chosen to use cornstarch instead of gum arabic, there is no specific measurement to follow. Begin by adding 2 tsp. of cornstarch to your hot tea and stirring vigorously. Continue to add 1 tsp. at a time until the ink reaches a nice, thick consistency., The addition of 1 tbsp. of white vinegar to your recipe works to fix the ink and create a stable, uniform color. If you have vinegar at home, consider adding this optional ingredient. Simply measure out 1 tbsp. of white vinegar, and add this to your tea, after the addition of a thickening agent. Stir well., Another optional addition is that of thyme essential oil. Thyme essential oil prevents the growth of mold in your ink. If you intend to bottle your ink and to save it for a while, this may be an important addition. Essential oils can be found at most health food stores. (They tend to be a bit pricey, but will last you for a very long time)., Allow your concoction to steep for 15-20 minutes. Leaving it to simmer on very low heat may result in a deeper hue. Set a timer and watch your tea darken and transform., Using either the back of a spoon or your tea strainer, squeeze down the tea bags or tea leaves, removing all of the water. This works to release more tannins into the water, creating a richer ink.

, Strain the hot water into another bowl (or down the sink), in order to remove the tea leaves and/or tea bags. If using loose-leaf tea, you may want to repeat this step to ensure that all particles have been removed from your ink.

, Your ink is nearly done, however you will need to allow it to cool down completely before it will be ready to use. This cooling down time allows the color to set. Cool ink will also have a more dramatic effect on paper., Using a steel nib pen, dip pen, or quill pen, simply place the tip into your ink and begin writing. If you do not have a pen like this, you can make one by making a diagonal slice in the bottom of a plastic straw.Fountain pens should not be used, as this ink can damage them.

, Once cooled, your ink can be bottled. Using a small funnel, pour your ink into your small glass bottle. (If you do not have a funnel, you can make one out of thick paper.) Close the lid tightly and store your ink in a cool, dry place."

Buy eraser clay.,
Warm and shape the clay.,
Use tools if you wish.",How to Make Erasers1," Look for crafting clay specifically designed for use in creating your own erasers. This special molding material comes in a variety of colors and kits, available in most craft stores.


Try brands like Sculpey or Creatibles for easy-to-find eraser clay in a variety of colors, and even some that come with sculpting tools.
Eraser clay is made with a special type of polymer clay, which doesn’t harden completely when cooked. While some have discovered methods like rubbing an eraser on the sticky part of a post-it note will create a similar substance, it is easiest and most consistent to buy the premade clay.;
, Pull off pieces of the eraser clay to squeeze and warm them in your hands until they’re very soft and pliable. You can then shape pieces into any shapes you want.


Make the clay into any fun shapes you like, including animals, foods, or geometrical shapes. You might find that very thin shapes are too brittle to use, and the shape that traditional pink rubber erasers come in is easiest to hold and use when erasing pencil marks.Try blending colors together to create one that’s not already included in the eraser clay kit that you buy. To do this, simply roll and knead two colors together until they are fully blended. You may want to test two very small pieces first to make sure you get the color you expect.Note that if you make shapes using more than one piece stuck together, you should make sure that they connect very well to one another, or they may become detached during cooking.

, Use any household items you have on hand to help cut, roll, and shape your eraser clay into your desired shape. You may also have some shaping tools included with the eraser clay you bought.


Try using popsicle sticks, toothpicks, butter knives, and cylindrical objects to cut, poke, roll, and shape your eraser clay. You can even find objects with interesting texture to press into the clay to make a unique pattern.
If you want to make an eraser that fits on the top of a pencil, use the end of a pencil to make an indentation in your eraser clay design, or shape the clay right onto the pencil. Then slide the eraser off the pencil carefully to keep its shape before putting in the oven or hot water to set.
Try a silicone mold if you want to make your erasers into clearly defined shapes. You can even make your own silicone mold of any object using mold putty. Pack the clay into a mold evenly, then pop it out of the mold and trim any unwanted excess."

Hold the pencil right.,
Carve away at the pencil wood.,
Sharpen a carpenter pencil.",How to Sharpen a Pencil2," You want to grab the pencil near its point if you are sharpening it with a knife, about 1 ½ inches from the end of the pencil. This will stabilize the pencil. Hold the pencil in your non-dominant hand, and the knife in your dominant hand.


You want to make sure the utility knife is sharp. You can sharpen your knives (carefully) with a knife sharpening stone or steel.Position the knife about ¾ of an inch up the shaft of the pencil. Start to remove the wood. Expose the graphite that is within the pencil itself.
Push the blade of the knife through the pencil’s wood with your thumb holding the pencil. Push the knife toward the unsharpened end of the pencil as your non-dominant hand rotates the pencil. A thumb knuckle’s length away from the end of the pencil is how deep you want to go. Once you’ve exposed the graphite, you can shape it into a point.

, You’re ready to refine the graphite when it’s showing about 3/8th of an inch. Keep the blade’s steel on the graphite. Hold it as a low angle. You don’t want to remove too much material.


If your knife doesn’t cut through the pencil’s wood easily, it’s probably too dull. If the lead of the pencil is soft, cut small bits away of the wood at a time. If your pencil sharpener will not sharpen the pencil well, check that the space where the pencil tip should go is not blocked by broken graphite (the black part) from the tip of the pencil. If it still will not sharpen well, the blade in the sharpener may be blunt. Do not jam in the pencil too hard.
Knives are very versatile tools for sharpening pencils. Make sure you cut in a direction away from your body for safety purposes. Use a utility knife. Hold the edge of the knife so it faces the pencil’s tip. Put your non-dominant hand’s thumb on the non-sharp edge.Use your thumb to push the knife out with your thumb. At the same time, press down with the thump that is holding the knife. You could put a garbage can in front of you between your legs to catch the scraps.

, Take a utility knife. Hold the pencil firmly in one hand and make sure the tip is pointing away from you.Use slow and certain strokes in an outward direction to sharpen the pencil. You can also use a special carpenter's pencil sharpener. Insert the pencil into the hole, and slide it back and forth against the blade of the pencil sharpener.
Try an X-Acto knife. These are good for charcoal pencils because charcoal is soft and can be damaged by electric sharpeners. Worse, the charcoal can damage the sharpener if it gets stuck in it..

"
Choose a point style.,
Use sandpaper to sharpen a pencil.",How to Sharpen a Pencil3," There are four points to choose from when sharpening your pencil. The most common is the standard point. It’s a sharpened point that resembles a cone.A chisel point is created by using a knife to cut the end of the pencil into a chisel shape. This allows people to draw two types of lines with the pencil; the tip creates a thinner but darker line, and the flat sides of the chisel point create wider lines with softness to them.
The chisel will keep itself sharp as you draw. However, the chisel point can be harder to draw with unless you’re practiced at it. Artists sometimes use this pencil point.
The needle point is a sharp concave point carved with a knife. It is a very fine point and can be prone to breaking. However, it’s good for use in drawings with needle-point detail. Carve the wood around the pencil down more deeply to expose more of the graphite.
A bullet point pencil carves away wood from the pencil’s last centimeter. Then carve the end into a bullet shape with a knife. You can make many different types of lines with a bullet point.

, A good trick is to use a little bit of sandpaper to sharpen your pencil when the graphite gets a little worn down.


This way, you can sharpen the pencil without having to go through the full sharpening process each time. Many artists keep pieces of sandpaper next to their drawing boards for this purpose.
Another method is to buy charcoal pencils that are paper wrapped. All you need to do is pull the string on such a pencil to peel off a bit of the paper to expose more of the graphite.
Using sandpaper or a sand pad will also polish the charcoal. You don’t want to see indentations when you draw a straight line."

Set the erasers in the oven.,
Set in boiling water.,
Allow erasers to cool before use.",How to Make Erasers2," If the instructions for your eraser clay say to let them set using an oven, preheat it to the instructed time. Arrange your eraser designs on a baking sheet so they aren’t touching one another.


For most eraser clay, preheat the oven to 250° F (130° C). Bake erasers for 20 minutes per ¼ inch (6 mm) thickness.You may want to bake smaller eraser designs separate from larger ones, as they will likely have different cooking times.
Use a piece of aluminum foil or wax paper on the baking sheet to keep the erasers from sticking.
Make sure children have adult supervision during this step.

, If the instructions for your eraser clay say to let them set using boiling water, pour water into a pot and place it on the stove. Set the water to boil, then place your eraser designs into the boiling water for a few minutes.


Make sure you have enough water in the pot to completely cover your eraser clay designs.
For most eraser clay that uses this method, leave the erasers in the boiling water for 5 minutes, then turn off the burner and allow them to sit in the water as it cools.Remove the erasers from the water safely using a slotted spoon and set them to dry on a paper towel or napkin. Use caution and have an adult present for this entire step.

, After setting in the oven or on the stove, let your erasers cool for a couple of hours. Then enjoy using your personalized erasers to remove any pencil marks.


Test your erasers out when they’ve cooled down. If they are too soft, you may need to set them for longer. If they are too hard, you may need to try again and set them for less time. If they are too brittle, you may want to try again with thicker shapes.
Store your erasers in a container that seals tightly to make your erasers last as long as possible. They may become too dry and brittle for proper use if exposed to the air over a long period of time.

Locate and buy melamine foam.,
Soak your melamine eraser in cleaner.,
Use the damp “eraser” for cleaning.",How to Make Erasers3," Get the material used for the Mr. Clean “Magic Eraser” and other similar products simply by purchasing melamine foam. Find this foam in bulk or multi-packs from online stores like Amazon.


You may also be able to find this material in stores that specialize in soundproofing or insulation, as melamine foam is also used for these purposes.If your melamine comes in larger sheets or blocks, cut it into an easy-to-handle size, as in a rectangle that is 6 inches (15.24 cm) long, 4 inches (10.16 cm) wide, and 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick, or whatever you prefer. Use heavy-duty scissors or a utility knife.

, Use your favorite cleaner to infuse the foam with a cleaning agent that will make it act as an “eraser” for cleaning. You can use any cleaning solution you like.


Try a combination of baking soda and Borax cleaner for a simple solution. Put 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of Borax and 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of baking soda into a bowl with ½ cup (118 milliliters) of water to soak one sponge-sized piece of foam.You can also create a more natural solution with lemon juice and baking soda, or you can simply wet your eraser sponge in plain water and apply your favorite spray cleaner separately.

, Wring excess water out of your melamine foam and use it to scrub at stains on nearly any surface, as you would with a regular sponge. The uniquely porous material acts almost like a very fine sandpaper to scrub away stubborn substances.


Try your new “magic eraser” on wall scuffs and stains, bathroom faucets and shower walls, and other common areas that are difficult to clean with other products.Store your “magic eraser” in a place where it can dry after use, then re-wet it every time you want to use it. Discard the sponge when it becomes very discolored or deformed.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Pour the acidic solution into a bowl.,
Write on the paper.,
Let the ink dry fully.,
Apply heat to the paper.,
Reveal the writing with salt.",How to Make an Invisible Ink Pen1," To make an invisible ink pen, you will need Q-tips or a paintbrush, an acidic solution, a shallow dish or bowl, white paper, and a source of heat. The Q-tips or paintbrush will be used to do the actual writing. Choose the item that works the best for you.Any of the following can serve as the acidic solution for the invisible ink: milk, vinegar, or lemon juice.
The heat source can be a candle, a hair dryer, an iron, or even a lamp.
All of these items should easily be found around the home or purchased at the grocery store.;
, If you are using a lemon, squeeze the lemon until the juice comes out into the bowl. If you are using milk or vinegar, pour about half of a cup into the bowl. The exact amount isn’t important. You will only need enough to write your message.Dispose of the liquid down the drain when you are finished.
Do not use the liquid for anything else once you have used it for invisible ink.

, A Q-tip is a very easy device to use as a pen. Dip it in the solution until it is damp. Write your secret message, dipping the Q-tip into the ink every few letters. This ensures that you have used enough ink for the message to show up later.It may be difficult to keep track of what you are writing because the writing will be invisible as well. If you write at a well-lit table you will be better able to see what you are writing while the ink is still wet.

, Before revealing your hidden message, you need to let the ink dry completely. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes for the ink to finish drying.


Set the first paper aside and write more messages while you wait for the first one to dry.

, Once you have obtained a heating device, apply it to the paper where something has been written with the invisible ink. As the paper heats up, the areas that have invisible ink on them will begin to turn brown. When the message starts to appear, remove the heat source from the paper. If the message is unclear, keep the heat on for a few more seconds until it comes clear.Be extremely cautious not to light the paper on fire if you are using a candle. Adult supervision is recommended for this to avoid burns or other injury.
If you are using a hair dryer, use the low heat seating and wave it across the paper until the words appear.
If you are using an iron, use it on a low setting. To avoid burning the paper away, place a piece of parchment paper between the iron and the paper before rubbing the iron on top.

, You can tweak this method a little bit by using salt instead of heat to reveal the message. When the ink is still wet, cover it in salt. Let the salt sit for at least two minutes and then brush it away from the ink. Let the ink fully dry and then color over the message with a wax crayon.The wax will not stick to the salt in the ink and you will be able to read what is written!
There is no exact amount of salt to use, just make sure the message is covered completely while the ink is still wet.

Create file categories.,
Set up subcategories.,
Use a color-coding system.,
Label the files.,
Sort the files alphabetically.,
Leave several inches of space in each filing drawer.",How to Organize Office Files1," The first thing to do if you want to organize your files is decide what major categories you will use for sorting. Different kinds of offices will have different kinds of categories, but the general system is the same. You need to figure out a system that sorts your files in a meaningful way.For example, if you work in a law office and need to organize client files, you might sort by general case types: litigation, probate, corporate, administrative, and others.;
, Within each single category, you can get more specific by developing a list of subcategories. Any individual piece of paper that needs to be filed can be defined by two terms -- the general category and then the subcategory.For example, if you are setting up a filing system for financial matters, you might have a general category of “Outgoing Payments,” and then set up subcategories of vendors, suppliers, services, professionals and administrative costs.

, This sounds simple, but it can be a very effective way to organize your files for quick access. Decide how many different categories you will have in your filing system, and then use that many different colored folders.Instead of using folders that are completely colored, you can use regular manila folders and get colored stickers. You can then affix the stickers on the top tab, on the edge of the folder, or both for more visibility.

, Each file in your office now has a clear place to be. You should write the label on the tab of each folder clearly and neatly so you will know where it belongs. The label on each individual folder should start with the general category and then be followed by the specific subcategory. For example, a folder containing records of payments to your vendors would have the label, “Outgoing Payments / Vendors.”


The labels on each file should be printed as neatly and consistently as possible. You can very easily buy a software packages that will allow you to format labels, so you can type and print them using your computer.
If you print your labels with your computer, you should use a consistent font size and style. If you are printing by hand, you should try to be consistent and as neat as possible.

, When your filing system is established and you have created all your folders, then put them in order. You should sort the general folders alphabetically. Within each general folder, the subcategories should all be sorted alphabetically as well.You may choose to sort some information by date rather than by a topic label. If so, then you will need to decide for yourself if it makes more sense to sort your files with the newest items in front and move to the oldest, or vice versa.

, When you are establishing your filing system, you need to leave room for the files to grow. As time goes by, you will undoubtedly receive more papers to add to each folder. Leave space for your files to expand. Otherwise, you will have the difficult task later of moving entire sections or file drawers in order to make room."

Gather your materials.,
Cut the flower stems to 1.5 inches.,
Take out the ink cartridge.,
Wrap any extra leaves with the stem of your fake flower.,
Put the ink cartridge back and stick the flower stem in after it.,
Starting at the top, near the flower, wrap the green tape around until you hit the tip of the pen.",How to Make Flower Pens1," You'll need some fake flowers from the craft store, green floral tape, wire cutters, and a pen (or however many you're looking to make!). If you’re looking to make a bouquet or give a variety to different people, it’s best to buy a bulk pack of cheap pens are your local dollar store., If your fake flower has a wire in it, use a wire cutter to clip it or it may be brittle enough to just wiggle back and forth and break.If there are leaves attached to the stem of your fake flower, you can cut them off with scissors or keep some for your desired effect. Leaves can easily be pulled off the main stem or cut off but be sure to leave a bit of stem at the end of the leafs if you plan on wrapping them back up into a bouquet., Before cutting the ink cartridge, measure how deep you want to place your flower stem and leaves. Using your wire cutters or sharp scissors, cut off about 1 inch from the ink cartridge (long enough for the flower stem to fit after it in the pen).

, Using green floral tape, make sure you wrap any leaves with your fake flower stem as tightly as possible to ensure that they will fit down the shaft of the pen.If you want to include a lot of leaves or the shaft of the pen is too small to fit the wrapped flower stem, you can also use the green floral tape to tape the flower stems outside the shaft of the pen. The green floral tape will be wrapped along the entire shaft regardless where you place the flower stems., Use scissors or the wire cutter to adjust the length of either the ink cartridge or flower stem. You may also place the tape flush against the pen as you wrap tape to bind them together. Hold the bottom of the pen to make sure your wrap is as snug as possible., Tape slowly and make sure to tape over the drop of the stem to create the illusion of a single stem. Keep a consistent wrap pattern as you make your way downward. Also, be sure to keep your wrap as tight as possible as you cover any sign of the pen shaft.


If you have the time and skill, you may also attempt a pattern with your stem wrap. For example, you can create a zig zag or layers of parallel lines.
Use double sided tape if you find that your floral tape is not sticky enough.
You may leave space for your grip if you intend to use the pen for writing rather than display.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Write on the paper with the jelly.,
Shine the black light on the paper.",How to Make an Invisible Ink Pen2," Petroleum jelly is a fun ink to use because it will glow in the dark under a black light (UV light). To use this type of invisible ink, you will need petroleum jelly, Q-tip cotton swabs, white computer paper, and a black light.Most of these materials should be easily found around the house.
You can purchase a black light at a local superstore or online.

, Dip the cotton swab into the petroleum jelly until you have a small amount on the end. You don’t want a big glob of it because that will be difficult to write with. Write your message with the tip of the cotton swab.For best results, try to make the writing smooth, avoiding bumps from the jelly.

, To reveal the written message, shine a black light on the paper. You can even turn the normal lights out or look at it in a dark closet. The words you wrote will glow in the dark under the black light.You don’t have to wait for the jelly to dry completely before revealing the message.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Dissolve the baking soda in the water.,
Write your secret message.,
Set it aside to dry completely.,
Brush the message with grape juice.",How to Make an Invisible Ink Pen3," For this type of ink, you will use baking soda for writing and grape juice to reveal the hidden message. To do this, you will need ¼ cup of water, ¼ of baking soda, Q-tips, grape juice concentrate, and a paintbrush/sponge brush.All of these items should be found around the house or purchased at the grocery store.

, Pour the baking soda into the water and stir until it is fully dissolved. The baking soda will dissolve faster if you use warm water. This solution will serve as the invisible ink for your secret messages.The exact amounts of baking soda aren’t important as long as you have equal amounts of baking soda and water.

, Dip the Q-tip into the baking soda solution until the tip is damp. As you write, you will need to dip the Q-tip into the solution again to make sure you have enough ink. It can be hard to see what you’re writing because the ink is invisible.While the ink is still wet you can see it if you are working in a well-lit room.

, The ink must dry completely before you try to reveal it or the reaction will not work. Put your papers off to the side and write more messages while the first ones dry. The ink shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes to dry.When the ink is fully dry, you won’t be able to see anything on the paper. It will look like a normal blank sheet of paper.

, Once the writing has dried completely, you can reveal your message. To do this, dip a paintbrush in grape juice and brush it across the message. When the message is covered in grape juice, the writing will change color and you will be able to read what is written. This works because grape juice is acidic and reacts with the baking soda in the invisible ink to change color.Avoid getting the grape juice on your clothes because it can stain.

Gather all the materials that need filing.,
Separate the papers into two groups for “action” and “filing.” As a first step, you should make a folder or pile for everything that needs immediate action.,
Pick up each paper once.,
Unfold each item.",How to Organize Office Files2," If you are beginning with a collection of papers that have not been organized and are in disarray, you will need to begin by pulling the papers together. Find a workplace and collect everything in one pile. You will then be able to work on organizing., These papers should not get filed, or you may not remember to do the work that needs to be done. Set this “action” folder aside to be addressed soon. Then proceed with filing the remaining papers.Organize the “action” file. The papers that need to be dealt with immediately should be sorted into smaller groups based on the work that you need to do. For example, set up such subcategories as call, write, deliver, and pay.

, As you sort through the loose papers that you are filing, make decisions about each one as you review it. Pick up the paper, read over it, decide which category and subcategory it belongs to in your filing system, and then put it away. Working this way will help you with consistency in your filing and will help you save time by dealing with each item only once.As you review each item, you should determine whether you even need to keep it. If the paper is something that has already been dealt with and is not something that you need to keep as a record, then consider discarding it rather than filing it.

, Most of the papers you have will probably have come in correspondence and are likely to be in envelopes and folded. Remove the papers from their envelopes, open them flat, and then file. Filing each paper in this way helps your folders fit uniformly in the file drawer, without bulging where the folded papers stack up.Decide whether you need to keep any envelopes. In most cases, the envelopes are unnecessary and can be discarded. However, if you believe you may need proof of delivery or proof of a postmark, then you should staple the envelope to the papers and keep them together.
Multiple papers should be stapled together. This will prevent things from getting separated or lost. Staples are preferable to paper clips because (a) they fit more uniformly in the files and (b) they do not have the problem of slipping off.

Use a “To File” basket.,
Designate a consistent time to work on filing.,
Make sure that others with access to the files understand the system.,
Keep vital documents in a safe place.,
Review your files regularly.",How to Organize Office Files3," When new correspondence enters your office or when new paperwork is created, you may not be able to file it right away. You should place everything that needs to be filed in a single place to be filed when you are able. A basket on your desk, labeled “To File,” is a good way to set these papers aside until you are ready., If you can, schedule a consistent time each day or week that you can work on filing new papers. If you make filing a regular part of your routine, you are more likely to keep up with it.For example, you might set aside the last half hour of each day to file the day’s papers. If this is not enough time, then you might try doing your filing twice each day, just before you go to lunch and then just before leaving for the day.
The keys to success are consistency and repetition.

, If you are the only person using your files, then you should easily be able to maintain the order that you have created. However, if other people need to use the papers in your files, you should make sure that they understand -- and follow -- the system that you have created. Having a filing system in place is not helpful if papers get misfiled and put into incorrect folders.If may be more efficient and more effective if you offer to get anything that someone else in your office might need, and then ask them to return everything directly to you. Then you can be sure that everything gets refiled correctly.

, Some special materials may need to be held in separate, special locations. For example, some papers may need to be kept in a safe or in a fireproof lockbox. You may even need to keep some materials off-site, in a bank safety deposit box or at your company’s lawyer’s office., At least once a year, or more frequently if necessary, you should set aside some time to review your files. The purpose of this review is to decide whether there are papers or entire folders that can be discarded or perhaps moved to an off-site storage facility. If something is never going to be needed again, then you should discard it. If it is something that you do not expect to use regularly but may need to keep as a record, then you should send it to storage."

Get 2 or more rolls of duct tape.,
Cut a piece of green or dark duct tape that is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and fold to cover the pen shaft.,
Choose the color for your petals.,
Fold the sides of a single piece of duct tape to create a single petal.,
Continue to add petals until you’ve created your desired look.",How to Make Flower Pens2," You'll want one green roll of duct tape for the stem and another color of your choice for the petals. Duct tape comes in a variety of colours so you can get as creative as you want when making your flower.

, You can use your pen to measure the length of the duct tape that you will be using. Use a sharpie to mark the edge of your pen cap to ensure your pen can still close. Place your pen vertically against a piece of duct tape and line up the edge of the tape with the line you just marked. Cut the tape so it measures from the top of your pen to the line you marked with your sharpie. Roll the tape on the pen.You may also wrap around the pen to create a pattern to the top.

, Whether you want all pink or an assortment of petals, design your finished flower to ensure you keep the pattern you want. You can find a larger variety of duct tape colors at an art supply store relative to a hardware store.

, Cut a piece of duct tape so it’s length is about a third or less of the length of your pen. Fold the top of the piece of duct tape so that it makes a triangle. Roll your pen with the extra tape at the bottom of the triangle so that the petal sticks to your pen with the top pointing out.You may also cut the top of the duct tape into a triangle rather than fold it in.

, Continue to cut or fold small triangle shapes with a little extra tape at the bottom, and stick them onto the top of the pen. Make sure that all the petals are pointing out to the top and you’re following the design you have laid out. Build up your flower buds petal by petal until your pen looks like a real flower!"

Pinch and secure with tape.,
Separate and fluff the petals.,
Cut the tape in the center.,
Glue leaves to the stem.,
Tape the flower onto your pen.",How to Make Flower Pens3," You'll need a pen, paper towels, and tape. You may also use food coloring or watercolor paint to color the petals of your flower. However, remember that less can be more as too much decorations may become distracting or gaudy.

, You will need standard size paper towels. You will need about 10 standard sheets stacked on top of one another. This will create rather larger flower for your pen so you can cut to your desired size., Using regular scissors or special scalloping scissors, create smooth and rounded edges along the entire border of your paper towels. Remember to keep the paper towels stacked as you cut them.The scallop design does not have to be perfect but it does have to be consistent around the edges.

, You may dip the scalloped borders into some water with food colouring or watercolor paint. You can get as creative as you want and try to use a lot of different colors on different parts of the paper towel. You may also leave the paper towel white for an elegant look.


Be careful with your design because the color will spread and make an can ruin an otherwise appealing effect.
Put the paper towel somewhere for it to dry. Then, repeat this process 3-5 times with other paper towels.

, Fold the paper towel stack as if you were making a paper fan. Make sure to keep the creases smooth as you fold it. Do not fold the paper towel stack unless all paper towels are dry., Pinch the accordion-like stack of paper towels at the middle and secure this shape with clear tape. Squeeze down firmly and make sure the tape is wrapped tightly at this point as the entire flower will become undone if not securely wrapped., Whether you used 2-ply or single, fluff both sides of the paper towel to make your flower bloom. Careful not to rip the towel as you fluff each petal. Make sure the petals are dry if you have chosen to add color., Each end of the fluffed paper towel stack is its own flower. Make sure to tape as much layers as you need in the center of the stack to ensure that both flowers will not come undone once separated. Cut at the center of the stack and reinforce each stem with more tape if needed.The amount of tape needed at the neck of each flower depends on the fluffiness of the petals.

, You may glue real or fake leaves together with your freshly made flower. You may either add the leaves to the neck of the flower or directly to the pen., Place the neck of the flower firmly against the shaft of the top of your pen. Use green tape to wrap your flower tightly. The flower will be fairly fluffy relative to the size of your pen so be sure wrap the tape around as many times as needed to secure your flower in place.

Trim the paper.,
Coat the paper with Mod Podge.,
Place the lead on the paper.,
Fold the paper over the lead.,
Roll the lead in the paper.,
Sharpen the pencil.,
Use your new pencil.",How to Make a Pencil1," Start with a square of origami paper, inner side facing up, and a length of pencil lead. Both are available at stationary stores. Lay your pencil lead flat on the paper and measure out the length. Use scissors to trim away any excess paper that extends beyond the length of the lead.


When measuring out the length of your pencil, make sure that one end of the lead is flat against one edge of the paper. Measure out the length using the other end.
Origami paper works best, since it's pretty and easy to manipulate. Newspaper or other waste paper is harder to wrap round the pencil, but friendlier to the environment.In terms of hardness, make sure that your pencil lead is HB. A lead that is 2B or above might be too soft and could snap as you work with it.
You can use standard graphite leads or colored graphite leads.;
, Use a wide, flat paintbrush to apply an even coating of Mod Podge to the inner side of the paper. Apply a generous amount, coating the entire piece of paper.


Temporarily set the lead aside as you apply the adhesive.
You can use glossy or matte Mod Podge; either option is appropriate.
If you cannot find Mod Podge, look for any combination glue/sealer in your craft store.
The adhesive will ensure that the lead sticks to your paper as you work with it. It also makes the paper more flexible, and as a result, the paper will be easier to roll.

, Line up one end of the lead with the perfectly straight side of your paper. The lead should be about ½ inch (13 mm) up from the bottom of the paper.


If the lead has a blunt end and a pointed end, line up the blunt end of the lead with the straight edge of the paper.

, Bring the bottom edge of the paper up and over the lead. Stick this flap of paper on top of the lead and onto the paper just above it, sealing the lead in place.


The lead must be tight and secure. Using your thumbnail, carefully press along the length of the wrapped lead from the top, forcing it further into the fold of the paper and flattening the paper flap in the process.
Use your paintbrush to coat the decorative side of the paper flap with Mod Podge or white glue after it has been secured in place.

, Use your fingers to gently roll the lead upward and into the paper. Continue rolling until you reach the opposite end of the paper.


Apply a firm amount of pressure as you roll the lead. You need to make sure that there are no gaps in between each layer of paper.
Be careful, however, since applying too much pressure can cause the lead to snap.
Keep the lead as straight as possible as you roll it up.
Let the wrapped lead pencil dry before continuing past this step. The drying process can take an hour or so, but you can help speed things up by letting it dry in the sun.

, As soon as the pencil is completely dry, use a sharp craft knife to shave away some of the paper layers at the pointed end of the lead. Shave the paper away gradually, bringing it to a slanted point.


You might be able to use a standard handheld pencil sharpener instead of the craft knife as long as the sharpener has a sharp blade and the pencil has sturdy, gap-free layers. Apply light pressure to avoid snapping the lead in the process.

, Your pencil is now ready to use and should write as well as any standard, store-bought version does.

Sub-divide full files with folders.,
Add tabs to the mix, when applicable.",How to Organize Files," You will need to determine just what kind of information you are dealing with so that you can put your files into order. Take your pen and paper in hand and while you are perusing your files, log the subject of each file and write down the information.For example, you might log receipts from groceries on your paper and then define the subject for these entries as ""Living expenses"" or ""Spending.""
If any files contain conflicting information, a broad array of documents, or are particularly full, leave a short memo to yourself next to each file subject.;
, Now that you have a list of the subjects contained in your files, you need to gather these into broad groups. Try to collect you file subjects into as few main categories as possible. You'll want to come up with broad categories until all your subjects fit into a corresponding master category.You never know what future files might come into your library, and you want your system to be flexible enough to accommodate. Some examples of main categories are:Money
Household
Health
Work/Business
Education

, You're in pretty good shape now that you've got your files sorted and your system categorized, but you'll be able to jump to your files in a jiffy if you include a color code. This allows for even more flexibility in your files, as you'll be able to cluster your files by category while still being able to apply alphabetization.You might consider coding your files with:


Green for finances
Red for personal documents
Blue for medical documents

, Take a look at your file log. Any place you've noted clutter, fullness, or discrepancies deserve a second look. Is there anything that looks like it might be unnecessary? This is the point where you should pitch all the junk you don't need right into the garbage.To help deciding whether or not a document should be kept, ask yourself, ""When have I needed this document? Will I need it in the future?""
Receipts are major contributors to clutter and, unless you are holding it for the potential future return of a product, can be thrown away almost immediately., This will change considerably based on individual need, but taking a look at the shape of your files should give you an indication of what kind of container you will need. Offices and large personal file collections might need a filing cabinet(s). Smaller archives can sometimes be housed in a small file box.


Be sure to purchase a quality file container. Your hard efforts at organization could be ruined by a spill if your container cracks or a handle is torn loose., Some paper documents appear important but don't really need to be held on to, while other paperwork you need to keep your entire life! Every few weeks you should think about time sensitive documents, like bank records, and give your files a once-over to see if any time limits have finished., You should keep deposit and ATM slips until you reconcile them against your monthly bank statement. Your monthly checking and savings account statements can be saved until tax season. After you complete your taxes, you can file the bank statements you need to prove deductions with your tax records. The rest can be shredded., Once you've checked and paid the bill, you won't be needing it unless it confirms a deduction to your taxes. You should also hold onto bills for items paid with credit that are under warranty until after the warranty expires.It's a good idea to keep warranty and corresponding receipt documents collected together by stapling the credit receipt to the warranty.

, These documents should be kept until expiration or replacement, then destroyed. Much of your personal information is included in these kind of documents, so you might consider shredding these for disposal., You should keep any tax related documents for the year in which you are filing it in a single file. If this file is too large, an accordion file might better accommodate the papers. After you file your return, feel free to trash the document., It is recommended that you keep all state and federal tax returns for a minimum of seven years, though if you file with an accountant you should inquire with him whether there are any associated files you might remove that are no longer necessary., These important documents should be kept for as long as you are alive. You may want to consider using a plastic sleeve to protect these, as normal wear and tear can make the paper delicate., You do not want to throw these documents away unless you have a term life policy, in which case you can throw out the paperwork once the term is up., The right filing equipment will ensure your files are orderly and safely organized. Depending on how extensive a filing system you are making, you may need to add a few items to this list, but the essentials for your personal filing system include:


Black Sharpie
Classification Folders
Colored markers
File box/cabinet
Folders (with tab for label)
Hanging files
Two-hole punch, Your sharpie and log are going to be your best friends while you write out each folder heading on the label of your new folders. Write clearly, and leave some space on the label for a dot of color for color coding.Readability is key for your labels, so consider using all caps, but whatever you do, keep the style in which you write consistent., Your alphabetic system is a matter of personal preference. Some people find it easiest to alphabetize all files according to first letter, some alphabetize master categories, then sub-folders, and finally individual documents in sub-folders. Apply whatever system you find most natural consistently to your files.


Some people prefer to use the law of superposition to organize individual documents in sub-categories. This means that each new document you add to a sub-folder is filed first, which will place old documents toward the back of the folder and newer documents toward the front., Bold colors that can be seen quickly and obviously are the best options for your color coding system. Try to match colors to commonly associated categories. For example, if you have a ""Money"" category, you might want to use green to color code this folder.


Each folder should receive a bold dot to the right of the written label of each folder. This way you can tell at glance the category every file falls into, even if you've laid several on your desk.
It might be helpful to use different colored files for each category (or for one important category) as well.

, There will be likely a few files that you use or reference frequently. These ""active"" files might be a little more convenient for you if you had them on your desk or somewhere else readily available.Remove active files after you have labeled and color coded. This way you can move active files seamlessly between your desk and file container.

, Put your hanging files into your file container. These will form the main divisions in your filing system and will keep your file groups from getting too ungainly or cumbersome. Into each hanging file you should put 2 to 3 regular file folders, although you may be able to fit more or less depending on the size of the folders., Time will take its toll on your files, not to mention various things can happen throughout the years to fatigue your filing system. Keep some extra files folders and hanging files on hand, as these will absorb much of the weathering over time.


Keep an eye on your file container as well. A broken handle or clasp on your file container can save you from hours of work down the road.

, When you're working hard trying to get everything in its right place, it can be difficult to see the whole picture clearly. Returning to your filing system after a few days or weeks can improve the efficiency of your system greatly. At that point you should be familiar with any of the weaknesses of the system, and a few small changes can make a big difference.

, When a particular hanging file gets overfull or becomes unmanageable with too many documents, you can add a smaller sub-folder to it so that it isn't so ungainly or split it into two separate hanging files. For example, if you have a lot of business expenses under your ""Finances"" category, you might collect these documents into a single ""Business Expenses"" folder, and nest that under ""Finances.""

, Tabs are a great way you can further subdivide your filing system for ease of use. Tabs are excellent markers of category, but can also be used to help you pinpoint slender, but vital, file folders.You can also use insertable tabs to designate your active files. You may want to label these tabs: Do now, Do later, and Pending (with pending indicating documents on which you are awaiting a response)"

Think about how you want your file drawers to be organized.,
Go through each drawer one at a time, making a brief list of the contents.,
Find a clean workspace such as a desk or table and take a preliminary look through any loose paperwork.,
Once all unsorted items have been separated, add any new categories to your list.

,
Look carefully at your list and decide on the most appropriate method of organization for you, your office, or your household.,
Make a new, clean list of files you will need to label.,
Be sure you have all of the supplies you need.,
Type up and/or print out your file labels.,
Go through your file drawers, one at a time, and put in the new empty files in alphabetical order.,
Put an appropriate label on the outside of each file drawer and throw away all the nasty old folders.",How to Reorganize a File Cabinet," If a system comes to mind—bills in one drawer, tax information in another, et cetera-make notes on a pad of paper.;
, If you already have files set up, write down the names of the files and their contents.

, Start sorting the papers into piles according to how you would like them organized: credit card bills in one pile, expense reports in another, and so on. This is a good time to set aside out-of-date items for storage or shredding.

,, For work files, you might want a file for each project or department; for personal files, you might separate them according to type of bill. Keep in mind that you may want to sub-organize items by month or year.

, Put each drawer on a separate page. On the left side of the page, list ""category"" files; these are usually hanging folders. On the right side of the page, list the individual files you want in each category; these are usually manila folders. For example, a hanging file labeled ""Credit Card Bills"" might contain folders labeled ""MasterCard,"" ""Visa,"" and ""Gas Card,"" or you might have files labeled ""Bills 2005,"" ""Bills 2004,"" and so on.

, A series of hanging files combined with manila files, all clearly labeled, is a great way to organize any file system. Go to an office supply store and pick up the appropriate size files along with your choice of file folder labels.

, Apply the labels to the hanging folders and manila file folders.

, Now empty all your old files and put the paperwork in the appropriate places. Do the same for any loose paperwork.

, Now you're finished!

Dent the end of the twig.,
Drill into the twig.,
Coat your lead in glue.,
Insert the lead into the twig.,
Trim the end of the lead.,
Sharpen the pencil.,
Use your new pencil.",How to Make a Pencil2," Find a straight twig that fits comfortably in a pencil grip. It should be at least three to four times thicker than the 2-mm pencil lead you'll be using for the project, but no more than ½ inch (13mm).You can get creative by looking for a twig with an interesting color pattern or texture. Avoid selecting any piece of wood that could give you a splinter.

, Use small to medium pruning clippers to trim the twig down to about 5 inches (13 cm).Also cut away any parts that could get in the way as you write.


Take this time to examine the interior of your twig. If you see bugs or holes from pest damage, discard it and find a new one.

, Use a clamp to secure the twig to the edge of a workbench or to a piece of plywood. Apply enough pressure to hold the twig in place, but no more. Too much pressure can snap the twig.


Situate the twig so that the cut end hangs slightly over the edge of your work station. This will be the writing end of your pencil.

, Locate the center of the cut end (the intended writing end) of your twig. Firmly yet carefully press into this center point with a scratch awl. You should use just enough force to leave an indentation in the wood at this point.


You can use a sharp nail tip instead of a scratch awl.
This indentation will become the starting point for your drill bit.

, Fit your drill with a 3/32-inch (2.4-mm) drill bit. Drill straight into the twig using the indentation you just made as a starting point. Keep going until you hit a depth between 1 and 1.25 inches (2.5 and 3.2 cm).


Pull the drill bit out occasionally as you work, to clear away wood chips from the flutes or grooves. If these wood chips appear stuck in the drill bit, stop the drill and quickly scrub the sides of the bit with an old toothbrush or similar utensil.

, Test that the lead fits in the hole, then drill the hole wider if necessary. Once you're sure it fits, squirt a shallow puddle of white craft glue onto a piece of scrap cardboard. Roll the bottom 1 to 1.25 inch (2.5 to 3.2 cm) of your lead in this glue.


Make sure that the lead is coated all the way around its perimeter.
The glue will help hold your pencil lead in place when you insert it into the twig. You only need to coat a length of lead equal to the depth of your hole.

, Carefully wedge the glue-covered end of lead into the hole of your twig. You may need to wiggle it back and forth a bit to spread the glue inside the hole.


Work carefully to avoid snapping the lead.
Keep going until you have pushed the lead completely inside the hole. Do not leave part of the hole vacant.

, A significant portion of lead will still extend past the hole of your twig. Trim it down to size by pressing it against the side of the twig, snapping it off in the process.


Allow the glue to dry for several hours or overnight before continuing.

, Use a sharp utility knife to whittle away the wood at the tip of your twig, revealing a small tip of lead and sharpening the pencil in the process.


For safety purposes, move the knife in short strokes and work away from your body.
Gradually remove thin shavings of wood until your pencil is sharp enough to write with.

, At this point, your pencil is complete and should be ready to write with.

Grind graphite into powder.,
Add clay and water.,
Heat the mixture into hard rods.,
Cut wood into thin slats.,
Sandwich the wood and graphite.,
Finish the pencils.",How to Make a Pencil3," Here's an odd fact: ""pencil lead"" is made from graphite, not lead. This soft, black form of carbon has come a long way since the English used it to draw on sheep five hundred years ago.Because graphite sticks to regular grinding equipment, pencil manufacturers break it apart in rotating drums, or bash it together with jets of air.Colored pencils are made with wax, pigment, and clay instead, with no graphite involved., Mix china clay and water into the graphite, and you get a vat of grey sludge. This sounds simple, but it can take an entire week of mixing and drying to get the right consistency!China clay gets its name from the first people to use it for pottery. For centuries, only Chinese craftsmen knew which clay to use, and how to turn it into porcelain. It's a little less mysterious now that it's used to doodle on math homework.

, Machines now push the paste through a small metal tube. The long rod that comes out is cut into pencil-sized pieces. Finally, these enter a kiln heated to about 2,000ºF (1100ºC), to make them hard and smooth., Meanwhile, at a lumber mill, durable wood is cut into slats half the width of a pencil. In North America, pencil manufacturers usually use incense cedar wood from the west coast.If you see short or thin pencils for sale, the wood they came from probably had a defect. The mill cuts off the weak or damaged areas and tries to use the rest for these ""weird"" pencils or other purposes.
The wood may also be waxed and stained to make the color uniform, and to make the pencils easier to sharpen., The pencil lead and lumber finally get to meet. After carving grooves in the wooden slats, machines insert the graphite rods into each one. A second layer of wood clamps down over the graphite and gets glued on tightly., The factory now saws the wood apart into separate pencils. The final batch of machines trims these to uniform length, paints them, and stamps them with a company logo or other writing. If an eraser is attached, the factory crimps the end of the wood to get the metal band (ferrule) to stay in place."

Determine the length of the area to be measured.,
Determine the width of the area to be measured.,
If necessary, convert measurements to inches.,
Multiply length × width.",How to Determine Square Inches1," Squares and rectangles have four straight sides - in the case of rectangles, opposite sides have equal lengths, while in the case of squares, all four sides are equal. Measure any one of the square or rectangle's sides to find a value for length.;
, Next, measure either of the sides that touch the side whose length you just measured. This side should meet the first side at a 90 degree angle. This second measurement is your square or rectangle's width.


Since all four of a squares' sides are equal, the ""length"" measure you obtain for a square will be identical to the ""width"" measurement. In this case, you only need to measure one side.

, To get your final answer in square inches, it's necessary for both your length and width measurements to be in the form of inches. Below are conversion factors for common units of measurement:


1 foot = 12 inches
1 yard = 36 inches
1 centimeter = 0.3937 inches
1 meter = 39.3701 inches
1 millimeter = 0.0394 inches

, Simply multiply your measurements for length and width to determine the area of your square or rectangular area in square inches.


For example, let's say that, for a rectangular area, we measured a length of 4 inches and a width of 3 inches. In this case, the area within our rectangle is 4 × 3 = 12 square inches.

In the case of squares, since all four sides are the same, you can simply take the measurement of one side and multiply it by itself (also called ""squaring"" it or taking it to the second power) to get a square inches value for area.

Grind only the ink that you need for that day, and do not permit ink to dry in your ink stone.",How to Grind Ink," A good ink stone will have a hard, polished surface. You don't want it too rough because a rough surface can damage the brush.;
,,,, Place the end of the ink stick into the water and pull some water up onto the plain of the grinding stone.

, If the ink is too thick, it will not flow easily off the brush. If the ink is too thin, the color will be light. Practice getting the right consistency.

, Clean the ink stone with water and a soft sponge or cloth. Never use anything that could damage the stone. Cover the stone to prevent the ink from drying if you will take a break.

Find the area of a circle with the equation ""Area = pi × r2."",
Find the area of a triangle with the equation ""Area = 1/2 b × h."" The area of a triangle in square inches is given by multiplying its base (""b"") by its height (""h""), with both measurements in inches.,
Find the area of a parallelogram with the equation ""Area = b × h."" Parallelograms are similar to rectangles, the only difference being that their corners don't necessarily meet at 90 degree angles.,
Find the area of a trapezoid with the equation ""1/2 × h × (B+b).""",How to Determine Square Inches2," To find the area of a circle in square inches, all you need to know is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge in inches. This distance is called the circle's radius. Once you find this number, simply substitute it for ""r"" in the equation above. Multiply it by itself, then multiply it by the mathematical constant pi (3.1415926...) to determine the square inches within the circle.

, A triangle's base is simply the length of one of its sides,while its height is the distance from the ""base"" side to the opposite corner when measured at a 90 degree angle from the ""base"" side. The area of a triangle can be calculated using base and height measurement for any of its three sides and the opposite corner.

, Appropriately, the way to calculate a parallelogram's area in square inches is similar to the way to calculate a rectangle's - simply multiply a parallelogram's base by its height with both measurements in inches. Its base is the length of one of its sides, while its height is the distance from the opposite side to the first side when measured at a right angle.

, A trapezoid is a four-sided shape with one set of parallel sides and one set of non-parallel sides. To calculate its area in square inches, you must take three measurements (in inches): The length of the longer parallel side (""B""), the length of the shorter parallel side (""b""), and the trapezoid's height (""h"") - the distance between the two parallel sides, measured at a right angle. Multiply these three measurements by each other, then half the result to find the trapezoid's area in square inches.

Use your thumb, index finger and middle finger for this hold.,
Place the thumb pad to one side of the pencil.,
Place the index finger on top of the pencil.,
Rest the pencil on the middle finger.",How to Hold a Pencil2," No other fingers hold the pencil. Imagine pinching these three digits together, but not overly tightly, with the pencil in between.








, This side is the one closest to your body.








, The tip of this finger should just rest on top of the pencil. Along with the thumb, this finger holds the pencil in place.









Avoid placing undue pressure on the pencil with this finger. This is a common mistake that results in uncomfortable and/or heavy writing. Too much pressure can eventually result in pain when holding the pencil.

, The pencil should rest on the first joint of your middle finger. This finishes off the tripod positioning.

Bend all five fingers slightly.,
Try writing on a horizontal surface (your desk, etc.).,
Keep the underside of your thumb and your forearm aligned.",How to Hold a Pencil3," Avoid making a fist––a small ball should be able to slide into the cupped hand shape. Otherwise, the grip will be too tight and restrictive.









One method suggests that the two fingers need to bend back toward your palm while the other fingers do the maneuvering work. For children, it can be helpful to give them a ball or similar item to hold in these two fingers while the other digits hold the pencil.
Another method is to have these fingers work as supports for the writing fingers––just be sure they're bent. It's a good idea to try both ways to find what works best for you. You may find that the positioning is impacted by whether you're holding the pencil for writing in either a slanted or a perpendicular way (see next).

, Write while holding the pencil slanted or perpendicular (exactly upright) to the table. See which approach best suits your writing needs.








, If you find that your elbow tends to wing out, practice writing on a vertical surface, such as on a whiteboard or on paper on an easel. Writing vertically will automatically force your elbow, arm and writing hand into the correct alignment.

Choose the correct diameter of lead.,
Use specialty sizes for specific purposes.,
Determine the best hardness for your work.,
Consider your writing style.,
Choose the appropriate lead sleeve for your pencil.,
Prioritize .5 mm pencils for easier lead replacement.,
Discover your preferred lead advance mechanism.,
Use a pencil with a lead grade indicator for organization.,
Find a pencil grip that suits your hand.",How to Choose Mechanical Pencil Lead," Different mechanical pencils require lead of a certain thickness. You can usually find this measurement written either on your mechanical pencil itself or its clip. Because of how thin this lead is, the diameter is typically expressed in millimeters as a decimal, like 0.5 mm, as an example.


0.3 mm diameter is considered to be relatively thin. This size of lead might not be suitable for writing or sketching, but using it you'll be able to draw with very minute detail.
0.5 mm thick lead is one of the most common sizes. You might use this size of lead for writing or drawing. Overall, it's a versatile size that might be just right for your writing needs.
0.7 mm lead is a thicker variety, which makes it suited to sketching and non-detailed work. You may also find this lead useful if you do long-hand drafting.;
, Outside of .3, .5, and .7 mm lead, there are thicker and thinner sizes available for your mechanical pencil. These range from size .3 mm all the way to 5.6 mm, though sizes above .9 mm may require a specialty mechanical pencil to write with. These ultra-fine and extra thick leads are frequently intended for artists or draftsmen, though you may find that a specialty size suits your purposes as well.Some specialty leads, like sizes 2 mm and up, may require sharpening, unlike most other kinds of mechanical pencil lead. You should follow the directions that come on the packaging of your lead to learn the best process for sharpening., Soft lead will leave behind a thicker mark when you write. It is lighter and more smudge prone than other leads. Harder leads leave behind marks that are darker and finer. The two most common hardness ratings are medium grade HB and H leads, but there are three main categories of hardness that you should take into consideration:Soft lead. The softness of this lead is represented by a number followed by the letter B. The higher the number, the softer the lead. Therefore, 4B lead will be very soft, 3B lead less so, and so on.
Medium lead. With medium leads, the letter B represents the softest kind and will write like a No. 1 pencil. HB medium leads write the same as a No. 2 pencil. F medium leads are similar to a No. 1½ pencil. Last but not least, H medium leads will be hardest and correspond to a No. 3 pencil.
Hard lead. The hardness rating for hard lead is indicated by a number followed by an H. As the numbers increase, so too will the hardness of your lead. An H2 pencil will be softer than a H3 pencil, and so on., If you are aware that you have a tendency to use hard or soft pressure when writing, you should take this into account when choosing your lead hardness and thickness. The pressure you use when writing can have a distinct affect on the marks you leave on the page.


Heavy handed writers may find fine points break easily when writing, while soft leads leave behind thick, clumsy looking lines. If you're one such person, you may want to stick with medium thickness leads of medium hardness or harder.
Light handed writers may have difficulty with harder leads. You may find, if you have a lighter touch, that hard leads force you to press with your pencil harder than is comfortable., The sleeve of your mechanical pencil is the part that extends from the pen cylinder and ends where your lead emerges. There are three main varieties of sleeve for you to choose from: fixed sleeves, sliding sleeves, and sleeveless.


A sleeve will give you a better view of your drawing/writing area, making this feature an asset if you do detail work in pencil. However, you should be careful when pocketing a fixed sleeve pencil; the points of these could easily jab you in the leg.
Sliding sleeve pencils are able to retract within the body of your pencil. If you enjoy writing with a sleeved pencil but don't like getting poked when it's in your pocket, this option may be right for you., Even if you prefer a thicker or thinner diameter lead pencil, you may want to have a .5 mm on hand as well. This is the most common size of mechanical pencil, meaning that if you run out of lead and are in a pinch, you'll have an easier time finding or purchasing replacement lead.


When using a less common sized mechanical pencil, you may want to carry replacement lead with you. This way, you won't have to scrounge for specialty lead if you run out.

, A lead advance is the way in which your mechanical pencil advances lead from the hollow chamber in its barrel to the tip of the pencil. The lead advance of your pencil will be activated by a button, twist, or shake mechanism.


Push button lead advances come in a two different types. Some have a button on the side of the pencil, others use a top button that combines with the eraser. In either case, you can advance your lead by pressing the button.
Twist-operated lead advances were more common in older models. By twisting the barrel of your mechanical pencil, you'll cause the lead to advance. Some models may have a continuous lead advance, where the more you twist, the more lead is advanced.
A shake advance can be activated by giving your mechanical a firm shake up and down. This motion will cause a small weight on the inside of the pencil to advance the lead., There are some models of pencils that allow you to set an indicator to show you the grade (hardness) of the lead in your pencil. If you switch between grades when working on different projects, a grade indicator can help save you from using a pencil loaded with the wrong lead!, Most mechanical pencils come with a padded, soft, rubber-like grip on the part your hand holds. Different pencil grips will suit different hands, and some grips have special features, like bumpy textures to help you hold onto your pencil. Take a test write with potential candidates before you make the purchase to find what feels right to you.


Some pens come with a triangular shaped grip. This may feel strange to you at first, but some users appreciate the additional contact this kind of grip gives with the pencil."

Use b/x = x/(b+x) instead of a:b as b:(a+b).
,
Cross-multiply to get b^2 +bx = x^2, or 0 = x^2 - bx - b^2.,
Convert to the standard formula for the roots of a quadratic equation is {x1, x2} = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.

,
Substitute in our terms in the standard formula and get {x1, x2} = (-(-b) ± sqrt((-b)^2 - 4*1*-b^2)) / 2*1.,
Let now b = 1 and we have {x1, x2} = (1 ± sqrt(5)) / 2 and the answers computed from this are root x1 =  1.61803399 and root x2 = -.61803399.,

Requirements- You need two BIC® ""round stic®"" pens.,
Take the caps off the two pens and then break the ""clip"" of the cap with your hand or the scissors.

,
Take the ""front part"" (the tip that you write with) out of both pens.,
Remove the plug on the top of the pen with a chopstick.,
Cut off about 7 mm off of each ink tube with scissors.,
Now take the ink tubes and insert them into the pen with no ""plug."",
Take both of the pen caps and put them on.

",How to Make a BICtory Pen Mod for Pen Spinning," These pens can be bought virtually anywhere, from office stores like Staples to shopping websites like Amazon. You also need a chopstick or a handy tool for removing the tip off of the pen, and a pair of scissors to cut the ink tubes. We will discuss that later in this article.;
,, It should come off along with the ink tube.

, You can also use your teeth to bite off the plug. (NOTE: You only need to do this with one pen.)

, This is important so the ink tubes can fit easier.

, They go in on each side. (NOTE: The tips may not exactly fit onto the pen. You might need to tape one of them in order for the tip to stay on.)

,"
"
Pull off the cap.,
Screw off the barrel.,
Determine your filling method.",How to Fill Fountain Pens1," The cap is the top of the pen covering the “grip section,” where you hold the pen, and the “nib,” which is the part where the ink comes out.;
, The barrel is the cover housing the body of the pen, where the ink is held. The most common modern pens will require this step. Older and rarer pens will have self-filling mechanisms that do not require removing the barrel.


Instead of a barrel cover, built-in piston or button systems may have a “blind cap” over the screw knob or button.

, If you aren’t sure what kind of method to follow, examine the inside of your pen. Most likely you will have a plastic cartridge, or a piston converter system with a plunger, or a squeeze filler converter system that has a long button on the side of the pen.

Clean the pen if you are refilling the ink for the second time.,
Take the pen apart.,
Flush out the nib.,
Soak the nib in an ammonia mixture overnight.,

Use a soft cloth to clean celluloid, lacquer, and fine resin finishes.,
Keep the cap on the pen.,
Store your pen in a cup or other pen holder.,
Remove ink for long-term storage.,
Store unfilled pens in a pen case.",How to Clean a Fountain Pen," Fountain pens need to be cleaned periodically to ensure that they will work optimally. When you replace the cartridge every second time, it’s time to clean your pen. The same goes for refilling the ink bottle; if you’ve refilled the bottle twice, it’s time to clean the pen., A fountain pen has several different parts that will need to be dissembled in order to clean the pen thoroughly. Unscrew the pen grip from the barrel.


Take care with the ink cartridge if your pen has one. The ink cartridge is for one-time use and is punctured to release ink into the nib. Since the ink cartridge is punctured, it will leak ink if you turn it upside down. Keep it upright. You might want to use a pen cup or other holder to temporarily store the cartridge while you clean your pen.If your pen has a converter, remove the converter from the pen assembly. A converter is a reusable reservoir for ink. It can be refilled with bottled fountain pen ink.

, The nib is the part of the pen that you write with. Ink runs from the ink cartridge or converter through the nib onto paper. Run cool water through the nib. You can either use your faucet (running it lightly) or a syringe that will inject a small amount of water through the nib.


Run the water through the nib until the water runs clear.Use cool water only. Do not use hot water to clean a fountain pen. This temperature can damage the inner workings of the pen. Instead, make sure you have clean, cool water., If your pen has a lot of dried ink that won’t break up with water, you can use an ammonia mixture to loosen the ink. Add one teaspoon of household ammonia to a cup of water. Ammonia will help break up dried ink and any other dirt that may have gotten into the nib. Put the nib in the mixture. Soak it overnight.


You can also use vinegar instead of ammonia. Use one teaspoon of vinegar with one cup of water.
Do not use ammonia on Wahl Eversharp pens from the 1920s and 1930s. Likewise, don’t use ammonia to clean a pen with aluminum parts. These pens will be damaged by the ammonia.
Do not use any cleaners or soaps on your pen. These will damage your pen.
Do not soak nitrocellulose pens in ammonia, as the ammonia will discolor the pen’s covering., Shake the nib a few times to get any excess water out. Then leave it out for several hours (or overnight) to allow it to air dry.


You can rest the nibs upright on top of a paper towel. The paper towel will help wick away moisture from the nib as it dries overnight.

, Take the pen apart so that the converter is removed from the rest of the pen.

, Take care that the ink doesn’t spill where you don’t want it (on the table, floor or your clothes). Pour the excess ink into the garbage or into a paper towel.

, Running cool water through the converter will dislodge any ink particles and clear it out. You can either use a syringe that will allow you to run water through the converter, or you can use the faucet.


If you run water through the converter with the faucet, be sure to run the water very lightly. Otherwise, water can get behind the piston seal in the converter and may create a moldy-looking blob of ink that is difficult to remove., Cover up the end of the converter with your finger. Give the converter a good shake in order to break up any remaining ink that is inside the converter.

, Run cool water through the converter again until the water runs clear.

, Set the converter upright on top of a paper towel and let it air dry overnight.

, For pens that are made of silver, sterling silver, or plated silver, use a polishing cloth with a little dab of silver polish.If your pen has etching on it, you can use some silver polish with a toothbrush. This will work the silver polish into the grooves of the etching.

, Many fountain pen exteriors are made of platinum, palladium, stainless steel or chrome. These metal finishes can be buffed with a soft cloth.

, Older pens may have a celluloid finish, which is a finish that predates modern plastic. Just use a soft cloth to clean the celluloid. If your pen has a lacquer or painted surface, use a soft cloth to clean it. Do not use any chemical or abrasive cleaners on this pen, as these will damage the finish. Fine resin finishes can be vulnerable to cracks and scratches. Use a soft cloth to clean these types of finishes. , When you are not using your pen, keep the cap on it. This will prevent your pen from drying out.

, If you leave your fountain pen lying down, the ink will dry up in the nib.

, If you are planning to store your pen for longer than about a week, you should remove the ink so that it doesn’t dry up. Remove the ink cartridge and clean out the nib. Allow the nib to dry fully before storing the pen. Then you can store this pen in a pen case. If you leave the ink in the pen, the ink’s acids will mix with oxygen and start oxidizing the nib., Pen cases are intended to allow pens to lie flat. This is not beneficial for pens that have ink in them, since it will allow the ink to settle in the nib. Use these pen cases if you have already removed the ink, or if the pen is brand-new and you haven’t installed an ink cartridge yet.

Choose wooden pencils for affordability and durability.,
Select a mechanical pencil for convenience.,
Choose HB (#2) lead for general use.,
Purchase an ergonomic pencil.",How to Choose a Pencil1," Traditional wooden pencils with or without erasers are among the least expensive writing implements available. If money is tight, go for this option. You should also select wooden pencil if you press hard while writing, since the graphite in wooden pencils can withstand the pressure., This variety doesn't need sharpening and is usually refillable. Read the packaging for the length and diameter of lead that fits your pencil. A mechanical pencil might also be a good choice for standardized test, since its thinner lead is good for filling in small blanks.


Mechanical pencils typically cost more, especially for good quality, non-disposable ones. On the other hand, many allow lead and erasers to be replaced, meaning that you can use one pencil for much longer., This is the usual medium hardness of lead in wooden and mechanical pencils. You can use it for writing an essay or bubbling in the answers on a standardized test. If the pencil or the lead is not labeled, there's a good chance this is the hardness., Consider this option if your hand cramps up after writing for several minutes. Look for a pencil with a large padded grip. It widens the shaft of the pencil, allowing your hand to relax as your write.You can also buy rubber or soft plastic grips that you slide on the end of a pencil. They're available in stationery stores and book stores in the same vicinity as pencils and pens.

"
"
Replace cassettes.,
Add lead from the top.,
Add lead through the tip.",How to Add Lead to a Mechanical Pencil1," Exact instructions may vary by model, but generally, start by pulling the eraser out of the pencil, which will draw out the old cassette. Give the old cassette a shake just to make sure that it really is empty. If so, insert a new cassette into the pencil’s open chamber. Once it clicks into place, reinsert the eraser after detaching the old cassette., If your pencil doesn't use cassettes, try pulling the eraser out of the pencil. If it reveals the pencil's chamber when removed, feed the recommended number of lead pieces into the pencil’s chamber. Fit the eraser back into place when finished., If the eraser isn't removable or doesn't offer access to the chamber, load it from the bottom instead. First, depress the eraser end and hold it in place. Fit the first piece of lead into the tip’s hole. Gently push it all the way inside the pencil. Repeat with each piece of lead until you fill your pencil.


Note that some pencils advance lead out of the chamber by clicking a button on the side instead of the eraser.

Find the right cartridge size.,
Remove the cartridge, if one is present.,
Remove a converter, if one is present.,
Insert a new cartridge.,
Replace the barrel.,
Keep the pen in a vertical position.",How to Fill Fountain Pens2," Some pens use standard sized cartridges (small or large), but other pens use proprietary brands that will not accept the standardized sizes.

, To remove the cartridge, simply pull it straight out from the grip section.

, If there is a piston or squeeze converter already in the pen, pull it straight out from the grip section the same way you would a cartridge.

, Insert the stopper end into the grip section. Push firmly until the stopper is punctured and you hear a click. Ink should begin to flow into the pen. , Screw the barrel back on over the body of the pen.

, Hold the pen vertically, nib side down, to let the nib saturate. Place the pen in a small glass or find another means to stand it vertically. It can take up to a couple of hours for the nib to become saturated for the pen to write properly. "

Remove the cartridge, if one is present.,
Insert the converter, if one is not present.,
Submerge the nib in ink.,
Squeeze and release the converter.,
Twist the converter to raise and lower the piston.,
Clean excess ink from the nib.,
Replace the barrel.",How to Fill Fountain Pens3," The converter will replace the cartridge. To remove the cartridge, simply pull it straight out from the grip section.

, Slide the converter straight in toward the grip section. Some will have small “lugs” on the side that you have to line up with open slots. , Submerge the nib fully, up to the grip section, so that the vent hole is beneath the ink.

, If you are using a squeeze converter, squeeze the side of the pen until the ink bubbles. Slowly release your grip, then let go of the converter slowly to allow suction to draw ink into the pen.


Squeeze and release the converter again. Repeat this process until bubbles no longer appear in the bottle of ink and your pen is full.

, If you are using a piston converter, twist the end of the pen counter-clockwise, which will cause an internal plunger to move up or down. Then twist in the other direction to draw the plunger up to draw ink into the tube.


You may need to raise and lower the piston a number of times to completely fill the pen with ink.
Remove any air pockets. If the ink converter was totally empty when you started, you might notice that you can’t fill the ink all the way to the top due to a pocket of air. To remove the air pocket, twist the plunger counter-clockwise to empty all of the ink along with the air, then refill. Squeeze out a few drops of ink. Remove the nib from the ink, and twist the piston counter-clockwise until a couple of drops of ink come out. This will prime the pen for writing.

, Use a rag or paper towel to remove any ink still on the nib.

, Screw the barrel back on over the body of the pen.

"
"
Unscrew and remove the barrel.,
Clean the barrel.,
Grease the threads.,
Fill the pen using an eyedropper.,
Screw the grip section into the barrel half way.,
Turn the pen right-side up (nib down) and finish screwing in.,
Clean excess ink from the nib.",How to Fill Fountain Pens4," Unlike in cartridge or converter pens, the barrel is not a housing for a cartridge or a converter, but is a reservoir for the ink itself.

, If you have a new pen, or if you are changing colors of ink, clean the barrel using a cotton swab.

, To avoid ink from leaking, you’ll want to create a water-tight seal where the barrel screws into the grip section. Apply silicon grease to the threads. Screw the barrel on, and then screw the barrel off to spread the oil in between the threads.

, Dip the eyedropper into the ink bottle, drawing ink into it. Place the tip of the eyedropper into the upright barrel, and release the ink, filling the barrel. Fill the barrel to the bottom of the threads.


You can also use a syringe instead of an eyedropper.

, Place the grip-section on the barrel, and begin screwing it in.

, Doing this will cause a couple of drops to come out of the feed, priming the pen for writing.

, Use a rag or paper towel to remove any ink still on the nib.

Fill a vacuum filler pen.,
Fill a lever pen.,
Fill a button pen.",How to Fill Fountain Pens5," In a vacuum filler pen, there is a plunger that remains inside the barrel. Removing the knob will free the plunger to move up and down. Pull up the plunger to create a vacuum inside the pen. Then push the plunger down.


As the plunger reaches the wider, flared part of the pen, it will break the vacuum and cause ink to be drawn into the barrel., A lever pen will have a have a lever in the middle of the pen to compress a sac. To fill the pen, first lift the lever, then dip the nib in ink. Push the lever back into place and wait for a few seconds. Then, snap the lever back into place.You might need repeat this step a couple times until the pen fills.

, A button filler pen uses a button to compress a sac, which then creates suction to draw ink into the pen. To fill, take off the blind cap on the end of the pen. Push and hold the button down, compressing the sac. Dip the nib into the ink, then release the button to fill the pen."

Select a wooden pencil for linear variety.,
Choose a mechanical pencil for technical drawing.,
Keep a variety of lead hardness grades on hand.,
Use colored pencils to outline or color forms on paper.,
Select charcoal pencils for deep black or gray lines.,
Choose carbon pencils for smooth black lines.,
Use a grease pencil for glossy surfaces.",How to Choose a Pencil2," Sharpen the pencil for thinner lines. Allow it to blunt for thicker lines. The darkness or lightness of the line from a regular pencil depends on how much pressure you apply to the paper., It can achieve a finer and more consistent line. For a preparatory sketch, a 0.5 millimetres (0.020 in) lead will be sufficient. If you're aiming for a more detailed drawing, go with a narrower lead, around 0.3 millimetres (0.012 in)., Drawing involves creating a variety of lines and tones. Use H-grade leads for drawing light, solid lines that you don't want to smear. Opt for a B-grade lead for creating shadows or other parts of a drawing that require smudging. B-grade leads also create much darker lines and tones., If you're doodling on notebook paper or computer paper, go for the least expensive brand like Crayola. Sharpen them like a wooden pencil to achieve thin lines. Allow them to get blunted for thicker lines.If you're serious about art, visit an art store for high-quality colored pencils. They're more expensive, but you may find that they give a stronger color than you'll find in typical colored pencils. Some brands are much easier to blend than the less expensive brands., Like straight charcoal in stick form, this pencil is based on wood that has been burnt to the point where only the carbon is left. Unlike regular charcoal, they write a bit more smoothly. Apply strong pressure for heavy, dark lines. Ease up on the pressure for finer lines. Like lead pencils, charcoal pencils come in a variety of hardnesses. Buy them at any art supply store., Go with this variety if you're looking for true black, which you can't get with graphite. These pencils are based on lampblack, the byproduct of burning oil. Carbon also comes in varying hardnesses and can also be obtained in stick form. Buy them in any art supply store., Also known as china marker, this variety of pencil is based on a waxy crayon-like material. Choose this variety if you need to make temporary marks on smooth surfaces like ceramic, metal and, plastic. Sharpen it by pulling a string to expose more of the waxy point. You can buy them at the art supply store."

Select H leads for finer lines.,
Use B leads for darker marks.,
Select F lead for medium-grade lines.",How to Choose a Pencil3," H-grade leads are the hardest leads. Ironic as it sounds, these leads do produce finer lines. They're not as easy to sharpen, but the crispness of the lead's edges lasts longer than softer leads. For the lightest quality, opt for 9H. If you prefer darker marks from a soft lead, use H., B-grade leads are the softest leads. Choose this variety if you want to sharpen the lead more quickly and easily. The down side is that they lose their crisp edges more quickly. Use 9B for the darkest quality lines and B for the lightest.If you're drawing, you might outline with a harder lead, then darken and shade with a softer lead.

, F (#2 ½) is right in the middle of the hardness and darkness scale with the #2 lead. Like #2, it sharpens to a fine point. Its line quality is only slightly lighter and harder.While this lead is safe for drawing and general writing, it's not recommended for standardized tests. Not all test readers will give accurate results for even a slight variation from #2.

Dismantle your pen.,
Load lead into your pen.,
Reassemble your pen.",How to Add Lead to a Mechanical Pencil2," Find where the two halves of your pen screw together and twist them loose. Once the pen is opened, locate the lead dispenser inside. Pull it free from the lead holder., First, hold the top half of the pencil upside down, so the opening to the lead holder is facing up. Then feed the lead into the hole for the lead holder, one piece at a time. Remember to only load the recommended number of pieces, which will probably only be a couple due to the limited space., Fit the lead dispenser mechanism back into place. Screw the pen’s two halves back together. Give the pen’s pencil action a couple clicks to make sure it is operating smoothly."

Find out if your pencil requires cassettes.,
Use the correct size lead.Check your pencil to see if the recommended diameter of lead (usually expressed in millimeters, such as “0.5mm”) is featured on its design.,
Don’t overload the pencil.Expect overloading to jam your pencil.,
Seek help when in doubt.",How to Add Lead to a Mechanical Pencil3," Expect mechanical pencils to be reloaded in one of two ways: with or without a cassette. Cassettes already contain lead and can be loaded straight into the pencil as one piece, while cassette-less pencils require you to feed each piece of lead into the pencil. Check the instructions to find out which method is needed.Manufacturers often color-code their products so you can tell which type it is at a glance. Cross, for example, uses a black band around the base of the eraser to indicate that a cassette is required, and a yellow band to indicate that lead pieces need to be fed in individually.

, If not, refer to its packaging or directions. Only use the diameter specified. Avoid jamming your pencil with lead that is too thick, or being stuck with a wobbly piece of lead that is too thin.

, Refer to its instructions. Find out the maximum number of lead pieces that will fit inside. Some models may only fit two at a time, while others may hold up to nine., If you no longer have the pencil’s instructions, search the internet for the manufacturer’s website. Once there, look up the exact model of your pencil to find out its specifications regarding cassettes, lead size, and capacity. Expect most companies to have instructions for reloading available.

Go bold with a felt tip.,
Grab a bag of cheap, all-purpose pens.,
Find a pen that’s comfortable to use.,
Try out different pens to discover what type of ink you like best.,
Choose between different pens based on their unique features.,
Keep it simple with refillable pens.,
Buy your favorite pens in bulk.,
Invest in a premium pen and ink.,
Store and maintain your pens properly.",How to Choose a Pen," Ballpoint pens are the most common variety you’re likely to find. They make use of a rounded tip that allows oil-based ink to go on smooth and dry quickly. Ballpoint pens are basic, inexpensive and easy to purchase in large quantities. For most purposes, a ballpoint pen will work just fine.The best selling point of ballpoint pens is their low price. You can buy a large bag of disposable ballpoint pens for just a few dollars.
The oil-based ink in ball point pens can congeal and collect dust over time, causing it form gummy globs around the tip.;
, Rollerball pens are similar to ballpoints, but the ink they deliver is water-based, so it transfers to the paper quickly and forms sharp, dark lines. These tend to be fitted with a smaller tip. Their liquid ink is stored in an internal reservoir. Many business professionals favor rollerball pens because they combine the thin lines and precision of a traditional fountain pen with the practicality of a ballpoint.Having a finer tip produces thinner lines, which means your writing will look neater.
Rollerball pens can leak easily when they’re put in your pocket, held upside down too long or exposed to changes in pressure. If you’re not careful, the ink might ruin your clothes., Gel ink pens take their name from the thick fluid that they use to write. This type of ink creates extremely smooth, dark lines and allows for an even more effortless feel than ballpoint pens. Gel ink became popular as an alternative to scratchy, fine-tipped ink pens in the late 90s.Gel ink pens are usually refillable, and tend to be slightly more expensive than garden variety ballpoint pens.
One trade-off of gel inks ability to write in thick, smooth lines is that the ink dries very slowly. The gel sits on the surface of the paper momentarily before setting in. This makes it more likely to smudge and make a mess., Fountain pens were among the first types of pens invented and are still considered by many to be the best. They are called “fountain” pens because of the way the ink flows from an internal storage reservoir out through the tip when you write. The ink used in a fountain pens is dark and dries quickly, and the lines they produce are the thinnest and longest-lasting.Fountain pens are extremely customizable. They can be fitted with nibs (tips) of different thicknesses and refilled with inks of various colors. It’s also possible to vary the thickness of a line while writing with a fountain pen, as the shape of the nib allows for different angles of pressure.The biggest disadvantage of using a fountain pen is their tendency to leak, due to the way the ink is stored and transferred. They can also be somewhat difficult to learn how to write with.

, Felt tip pens ride the line between traditional ink pens and markers. They make use of a spongy fabric tip to deliver dark (and usually permanent) ink that sets into the paper very quickly. Their tips come in a couple different sizes, the thinnest of which is best suited for most writing tasks, while thicker tips are often used for art, construction and crafting projects where large, bold, legible writing is a necessity. The conical shape of the tip allows the writer to form thin lines using the point, or bold, tapering strokes by brushing with one side.Felt tip pens may not be your go-to choice for a writing utensil, but they can come in handy if you're writing on an unusual surface or jotting down something you want to make sure will be seen.
The watery ink in a felt tip pen has a tendency to run and bleed on thinner paper types. If you need to do some fine precision writing, such as signing your name, you may want to look elsewhere.

, Sometimes you might opt for quantity over quality, especially if you only need a basic pen for occasional writing tasks. If this is the case, run down to your local convenience store and snag a package of non-refillable ballpoint pens for a couple bucks. You’ll have a supply that will get the job done and last you for months (or possible even years, assuming the ink doesn’t dry out), so you won’t have to worry about running out of pens for a long time.


A package of 60 Bic Stic ballpoint pens can be purchased for less than $5. Inexpensive pens like this will be a no-brainer to people who aren’t looking to spend a lot on writing utensils.
What these sort of pens lack in sophistication, they make up for in sheer availability.

, If you do a lot of writing, make comfort a priority in picking the right pen for you. Many pen styles these days offer ergonomic designs and cushioned gripping surfaces. These features will be a benefit if you frequently spend hours signing, scribbling and outlining.Try out different pens and see what feels the best. Pay attention to things like weight, the width of the body and how well it conforms to your hand.
If you happen to use a pen you like while you’re out somewhere, make a note of what brand and model it is.

, Find an ink that looks good and serves your needs. People who like writing thick, smooth lines will do well with a quality ballpoint or gel ink pen. If you prefer the control and neat appearance of thin, sharp lines, go for a rollerball or fountain pen. Choosing an ink is mostly a matter of preference, as they each have distinct advantages and disadvantages.The biggest factors in deciding on an ink are how smoothly it transfers to the writing surface, how bold the color is and how likely it is to run, smear or bleed.

, If you plan on using the pen for a specific purpose, such as signing your name legibly on important documents or inking a drawing, look for a pen that will best serve that purpose. Artists will want to use fountain pens, since they offer the widest range of nip sizes and can be filled with almost any type of ink. Scientists, executives and students will likely gravitate toward pens that are easy to carry and deliver ink efficiently. Those with arthritis might benefit from writing with wider pens that are less painful to grip.People who are left handed should think about using pens that are filled with quick-drying inks, since they’ll be less prone to smudging if a hand is run over them., To spare yourself expense in the long run, give pens with refillable ink a shot. Fountain pens can be reloaded with various types of ink, and most fancier gel and ballpoint pens can be disassembled when you need to change out an old stick. It’s much cheaper to pick up some replacement ink sticks or cartridges than it is to buy brand new pens every time you run out.Keep a stash of refill bottles, sticks or cartridges in your home, office or locker so that you’ll always have fresh ink when you need it.
You can even get ink refills in unique colors, giving you the option of switching to blue, green, orange, purple or red ink if your work requires a lot of color-coding or you just get bored with plain black.

, Once you’ve found a pen you really like, get enough to last you awhile. Certain brands make their pens available by the bag, box or even case, perfect for people who are particular about what they use. Stockpiling pens will ensure that you have a constant supply, and save you the trouble of shopping for new pens regularly.


Visit wholesale stores for deals on bulk packages of your favorite pens, or order them online.
Older models of pens are frequently discontinued as new ones are released. If you’re partial to a particular pen, buy up as many as you can in case they disappear from the market later on.

, Assuming you have a little money to spend, do some research on top-quality specialty pens. Companies like Platinum, Waterman and Montblanc manufacture pens using flawless designs and durable materials, so they’re guaranteed to last longer, leak less and always perform at peak level. If you weigh your options carefully, you might never have to buy another pen again.Get a protective case to go along with an expensive pen to protect it from damage.

, No matter what kind of ink pen you end up going with, put it away somewhere room temperature and out of the way when you’re not using it. Store spares or refills together with your pens in the same drawer or in a nearby supply stash. Make sure the caps are secured and the pens are laid flat or arranged in an upright container to cut down on the chances of a leak.Keep track of where you leave your pens so that you don’t lose them.
Check your pockets for pens before you wash and dry them. Forgetting a pen when you do the laundry is a surefire way to ruin your clothes.

Gather your loose leaf paper together.,
Place one sheet of construction paper on top of your stack of paper.,
Get out your three-hole punch.,
Take the ribbon and tie it though the holes.",How to Make a Notebook1," This is the paper you will use for the inside sheets of the notebook. You can use lined or blank paper--it all depends on what you plan on using your notebook for. Stack these sheets together, making sure that they are all perfectly lined up and the edges are even.


You can use whatever size paper you would like. However, for someone who has never made a notebook before, you may want to consider using simple lined binder paper. This paper is generally 8x11 inches. It is easiest to use because it has its own three-ring hole punches already.
Blank sheets are common for art notebooks since a drawing, painting or any other form of art appears more prominent on blank A4 sheets. Darkly lined paper is usually used as a form of diary. Lastly, the lightly lined page is used for business equations and for such purposes. It depends on what you want and how you use it.;
, Take the other sheet of construction paper and place it underneath the stack of paper. This construction paper should be the same size as your inside sheets of paper. Make sure the edges of all of the pages are aligned.

, If you only have a handheld one-hole punch, you can use this as well. Insert your stack of paper, making sure that you keep all of the edges perfectly lined up. Push the stack in as far as it will go so that the edge of the paper can press up against the back of the three-hole punch. The holes should be roughly three or four inches into the paper from the edge of the stack. Press the punch down so that it makes the holes.


If you use the one-hole punch, use a ruler to mark out where the holes should go. You will want your holes to break the edge of your paper stack up into three sections. Make your holes about three centimeters away from the edge of the paper stack.

, You can do this in a variety of ways. Run your ribbon through the two end holes and tie a ribbon above or through the middle hole; cut the ribbon into three smaller ribbons and tie a bow through each separate hole; or weave it through the holes and then tie it together.

Get two pieces of 11”x17” construction paper.,
Fold the first sheet in half.,
Place the second sheet inside the fold of the first sheet.,
Fold the two sheets in half.,
Staple the sides of the pockets.",How to Make a Folder out of Paper1," This method calls for two pieces of 11”x17” construction paper. If you have larger sheets, you can simply cut them down to size., Take the first sheet of construction paper and fold it in half lengthwise.With the sheet folded, you will have a sheet that is roughly 5.5”x17” in size.

, Now take the second sheet of construction paper and place it inside the fold of the first sheet.You want to align the 17” edges when placing the second sheet.


Make sure that the bottom edge of the second sheet rests snugly into the crease you made in step 1.

, With the two sheets placed together, you now want to fold both pieces widthwise.This means you want to fold a crease along the 11” side of the whole sheet, which is the 5.5” side of the previously folded sheet.


Once you fold, the large sheet will be roughly 8.5”x11” in size, and the smaller sheet will form a small set of pockets around the bottom of it.

, After you have folded the papers in half, the center crease will make the spine of the folder, and the first sheet that you folded in step 1 will form pockets. In order to hold the pieces together, you simply need to staple the pocket piece to the larger folder piece at the edges of the cover.You can also place a staple along the bottom of each cover of the folder to reinforce the bottom of each pocket.
This folder will actually have four usable pockets—two on the inside of the folder and one on the outside of each cover.

Multiply the numerator of the left-hand fraction by the denominator of the right-hand fraction.,
Multiply the numerator of the right-hand fraction by the denominator of the left-hand fraction.,
Set the two products equal to each other.,
Solve for the variable.",How to Cross Multiply1," Let's say you're working with the equation 2/x = 10/13. Now, multiply 2 * 13. 2 * 13 = 26.;
, Now multiply x by 10. x * 10 = 10x. You can cross multiply in this direction first; it really doesn't matter as long as you multiply both numerators by the denominators diagonal from them.

, Just set 26 equal to 10x. 26 = 10x. It doesn't matter which number you list first; since they're equal, you can swap them from one side of the equation to the other with impunity, as long as you treat each term as a whole.


So, if you're trying to solve 2/x = 10/13 for x, you'd have 2 * 13 = x * 10, or 26 = 10x.

, Now that you're working with 26 = 10x, you can start by finding a common denominator and dividing both 26 and 10 by a number that divides evenly into both numbers. Since they are both even, you can divide them by 2; 26/2 = 13 and 10/2 = 5. You're left with 13 = 5x. Now, to isolate x, divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, 13/5 = 5/5, or 13/5 = x. If you'd like the answer in decimal form, you can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 10 to get 26/10 = 10/10, or 2.6 = x.

Determine what your budget is.,
Determine if you are going to collect old pens or modern pens.,
Pen stores are good for modern pens, but there are few over the counter stores selling vintage pens.,
If you are looking for pens for their writing qualities, buying used models from nonspecialists on eBay may not be the best bet.,
Be aware that not all limited editions have a strong secondary market, especially those offered by newer, less prominent pen makers.

,
Many parts of the vintage pen market have been soft for the past several years due to the retirement of first generation collectors and the preoccupation of Internet-era new collectors with vintage pens as users.",How to Start a Fountain Pen Collection," There are collectible pens that range from a few dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, but most fall in the three to four figure range.;
, Collecting modern pens is easier, but vintage pens offer much more variety, historical interest, and opportunity for the collector willing to put in study time.

, Older pens are available from online dealers, eBay, and other collectors, who may be reached through various online forums, collector clubs, and specialized pen shows. Pen shows are also a great place to acquire modern pens, including limited editions.

, On the other hand, there are a number of experts who offer restoration and nib adjustment services, so don't be afraid of buying a pen as is as long as the price is right.

,, There are some excellent values in classic vintage pens such as Waterman pens with metal overlays and large colorful Deco-era pens by Wahl and Conklin, to name but a few.

Select paper that is strong and colorful.,
Strengthen the paper if needed.,
Make holes in one side of the divider, so that it can slot into the binder.,
Decorate the dividers if wished.,
Decide how you will add a tab.,
Make your own divider tabs.,
Put your dividers into the binder.",How to Make Paper Dividers," Colored printer paper is ideal, as are thin colored card sheets (color helps you to quickly locate the divisions in your binder, against the white paper inserts). You could also use notebook paper, but it is probably best strengthened if you're going to use it as a divider page (see the following step).


The paper size must be the same as or larger than the binder or notebook. If it's larger, measure and cut to size.;
, This step is necessary for notebook paper, as it will prolong the life of the divider sheets. Choose one of the strengthening methods suggested below:


Use contact paper. Measure and cut out a section of contact paper that is double the size of one side of the paper sheet. Remove the backing from the contact paper and slowly cover one side of the paper sheet. Smooth out any bubbles or wrinkles that form. Then enfold the other side of the paper, to cover the divider completely. Cut away excess edges. The resulting divider sheet is now strengthened.
Find a piece of cardboard that is strong and thin. Art quality cardboard or cardstock is ideal (even ripped old dividers can be repurposed for this). Avoid using anything that is too thick or it will add bulk to the folder. Align the cardboard with the notebook paper and cut to size if needed. Glue the cardboard to the notebook paper; if using ripped old dividers, tape the ripped section flat before gluing onto the notebook paper. Allow to dry before proceeding and make the remaining dividers as well. You now have a set of strengthened divider sheets.

, Use a hole-punch for this and ensure that it matches the exact layout of the binder rings.

, You can add pictures, collages, stickers, drawings, notes, etc. Alternatively, add a list box and list all of the items behind each divider, or simply add a printed note as to the contents from an online spreadsheet.

, You can simply stick on a Post-It note but over time, this is liable to pull off. You can also purchase large plastic flag tabs that are a bit stronger or glue on small pieces of paper. If you'd rather make a stronger tab, follow the suggested version in the next step.

,


Measure a small rectangle on white cardstock. The rectangle should be around the same size as a tab would normally be, although you're free to adjust the size as needed.
Cut out the rectangle.
Write the name for the relevant divider onto the tab.
Cover the tab in contact paper.
Glue the tab to the divider (paper glue or spray adhesive work well). Alternatively, leave an edge of contact paper on one side when covering the tab, and use this to attach the tab to the divider sheet.
Continue in the same way with all of the remaining divider tabs.

, You can work your way from the bottom to the top of your binder, adding them where they need to be. Done!

Stack a five or six sheets of paper on top of each other.,
Make three holes in the folded over stack of papers.,
Run string through the holes you have made.,
Find the middle of paper you will use for the cover.,
Decorate your cover.,
Open the folded cover up.",How to Make a Notebook2," These should be sheets without any hole punches in them. An easy size to work with is paper that is 8x10 inches. Once the edges of all of the sheets are lined up, fold the sheets in half horizontally (this means folding the tops of the sheet over so that they are lined up perfectly with the bottom edge of the sheets). Turn your pages so that they lay like a book in front of you.You can use more than six sheets of paper if you want--just remember that this will make double the number of pages because the paper is folded in half. For example, if you use eight sheets of paper, you will actually get 16 pages.

, You can either use a handheld one-hole punch or a bradawl. Open the paper stack up so that the edges are all lined up and the stack opens up like a book. You will be placing your holes along the crease in the center of the pages. Measure three centimeters in from the top and bottom of the center crease.


You can also make this method easier by simply stapling the inside pages together. Line a stapler up so that the staple runs parallel along the center fold. Space your three staples out so that they spaced equally along the center of the pages.

, You can run your string through the bottom hole from the front and down through the top hole so that both ends of the string are on the inside of the pages. Take the ends and run both of them through the center hole. Tie them above the center hole on the outside of the pages either using a knot or a bow.Alternatively, if you made two holes, run the string through the bottom hole, starting at the back of the pages, pull the string through and then run it up through the top hole so that the ends of the strings are hanging out onto the outside of the pages. Tie the string together so that it makes a bow or knot over the middle of the center crease on the outside of the pages.

, Your heavier piece of paper you are going to use for your cover should be slightly larger than your inside pages. For example, if you used 8x10 inch paper for your pages, use 8x12 paper for your cover. Lay the piece of paper out so that it is horizontal and use a ruler to find the center of the paper. Make a light line with a pencil so that you know exactly where to fold the paper.


The paper you use for your cover should be pretty thick. You may want to consider paper that is thicker than construction paper.

, A beautiful and very simple way to decorate this kind of notebook is by using a small 8x8 inch piece of paper with a cute design on it. You can find this kind or paper at your local art supply store. Measure the paper and mark the center. Fold it in half and then fit it onto the spine of your cover. Glue it down so that the edges match up with your cover. The decorated paper should cover about three-fourths of each side of the cover, leaving room for any other decorations you might want., Lay the pages down so that their spine is fitted into the inside center of the cover. Put glue onto the front and back sheet, line them up with the inner cover, and then press them down. Your cover and pages should now be attached.

Stack your pages together.,
Mix up your rubber cement.,
Wait for the glue to dry.,
Cut out a piece of colorful paper.,
Bend the edges of the colorful strip so that they fold down over the top, front and back of the notebook.,
Cut away the extra paper.,
Place your notebook under a larger book.",How to Make a Notebook3," You will need two playing cards, preferably from the same deck. Use a ruler to measure the length and width of the playing cards. This will help when sizing the paper later.


Example: Uno cards measure 2 and 3/16 by 3 and 7/16 inches.

, Make sure that all of the edges are lined up. Measure out the length of the playing cards, making a mark where the measurement ends. If possible, use a paper cutter to cut the pages into strips where you marked the length of your playing card.


If you don’t have a paper cutter, use scissors to cut strips of the paper that are the same length as your playing cards.

, By doing this, you should create rectangles of paper that are exactly the same size as your playing cards. Repeat the previous step and this step on 10 more sheets of paper until you have as many sheets as you would like to have in your little notebook.Try not to exceed 50 pages, as this will make your notebook very thick and hard to bind.

, Place a playing card on top, and one on the bottom with the design you want facing outward. Tape the edges together so that all of the edges are as even as possible. Once all of the edges are lined up, Place large binder clips on the sides and bottom of the stack. The clips on the sides of the stack should be as close to the top as possible.

, Once your rubber cement is mixed, spread a good layer of the cement along the top of the stack. This is what is going to keep the notebook together. Cover every inch of the top, making sure you haven’t missed any spots. Make sure that none of it drips down onto the face of the playing cards.You can also spread a small amount on the very tops of the side edges. This will help to make sure that the notebook doesn’t break open when you flip the pages over.

, Once it has dried, apply another layer. You will need to add multiple layers to make sure that the glue is bonded strong enough so that the notebook doesn’t fall apart. Generally, around five layers will do. Once you see that the glue is drying on the edge, rather than soaking into the paper, you have reached the final layer.

, This piece of paper will be the binding of your notebook. Cut it so that it is a little longer than the width of your notebook and about one inch wide. Turn the pad of paper upside down so that the top is positioned in the exact center of the piece of colorful paper.

, Put glue on to the colorful strip and hold it down so that it lies folded along the top, back and front of the notebook. Hold it there for at least 20 seconds so that it stays in place., You may have some extra colored paper hanging over the sides of the notebook. Use scissors or a craft knife to cut these edges away.

, Your notebook will need a little time to bind together before you can start using. Placing it under something heavy and flat will help the glue to bind to the pages and make sure the notebook dries flat and straight.

Trim 1/4” off the third sheet of paper.,
Cut the third sheet of paper in half.,
Tape in the pockets.,
Personalize the folder.",How to Make a Folder out of Paper2," This method calls for three pieces of 8.5”x11” paper to make the folder.Generally speaking, the heavier the paper you use, the more durable the folder will be. Heavy cardstock paper is preferable followed by construction paper, but you can use regular printer paper if you have to.


The paper dimensions here assume that you’ll store mostly lined paper in the folder. If you need to store printed documents that already use 8.5”x11” paper, then your three sheets should be slightly larger. However, the paper size does not have an effect on the rest of the folder-making process.
If you must use regular printer paper, you can use six sheets instead of three and use a glue stick to double up each sheet.

, Take two of your sheets of paper and line them up so they are completely flush with one another. If you chose cardstock with a design on one side only, then make sure that the design on each sheet faces outward because these will be the front and back covers of your folder., With the two pieces of paper flush, use a long strip of tape to make a spine and attach the two sheets.Apply the tape so that half of the strip runs the length of one of the 11” sides of the first sheet, and then fold the tape around to adhere the second half of the strip to the second sheet.


Try to adhere the tape to both sheets without causing any creases or bubbles in the tape.
Make sure the two sheets stay flush as you tape or the folder won’t close symmetrically.
To reinforce the folder, you can also place additional strips of tape on each cover that overlap the edge of the first piece of tape., Once you have the outer spine taped, open the folder and place another strip of tape in the same spot but along the inside fold.This will reinforce the spine of the folder, and it will also adhere to the other piece of tape so that it doesn’t stick to your folder contents.

, To start making the pockets, you must first trim approximately 1/4” off the width of the third sheet of paper. By width, that means you will trim along the length of the paper. The end result will be a sheet that is 8.25”x11” in size., You will use this one sheet of paper to make both inner pockets on the folder, so you need to cut it in half. This cut will be perpendicular to the trim cut, and you will end up with two pieces of paper that are both approximately 5.5”x8.25”, Take one of the smaller pieces and line it up with one of the bottom corners of the inside of the folder. You want to place the smaller sheet so that the 8.25” side runs parallel to the 8.5” side of the folder cover. Once you have the corners perfectly aligned, apply strips of tape that fold around both edges the same as you did in step 3.


Again, try to keep the tape straight without any creases or bubbles.
As with the tape on the spine, you should reinforce the pockets with additional strips of tape that overlap the edges of the first strips. This will increase the life of the folder by quite a bit.
Repeat the process for the second folder on the other side.

, If you chose plain paper as opposed to cardstock with a design, you can easily personalize your folder with stickers, drawings, or even subject-specific pictures.

Multiply the numerator of the left-hand fraction by the denominator of the right-hand fraction.,
Multiply the numerator of the right-hand fraction by the denominator of the left-hand fraction.,
Set the two products equal to each other and combine the like terms.,
Solve.",How to Cross Multiply2," Let's say you're working with the following equation: (x + 3)/2 = (x + 1)/4. Multiply (x + 3) by 4 to get 4(x +3). Distribute the 4 to get 4x + 12.

, Repeat the process on the other side. (x +1) x 2 = 2(x +1). Distribute the 2 and you get 2x + 2.

, Now, you'll have 4x + 12 = 2x + 2. Combine the x terms and the constant terms on opposite sides of the equation.


So, combine 4x and 2x by subtracting 2x from both sides. Subtracting 2x from 2x on the right side will leave you with 0. On the left side, 4x - 2x = 2x, so you have 2x remaining.
Now, combine 12 and 2 by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation. Subtract 12 from 12 on the left and you'll have 0, and subtract 12 from 2 on the right side to get 2-12 = -10.
You're left with 2x = -10.

, All you have to do is divide both sides of the equation by 2. 2x/2 = -10/2 = x = -5. After cross multiplying, you have found that x = -5. You can go back and check your work by plugging in -5 for x to make sure that both sides of the equation are equal. They are. If you plug -5 back in to the original equation, you'll get -1 = -1.

Multiply the radicands.,
Factor out any perfect squares in the radicand.,
Place the square root of the perfect square in front of the radical sign.,
Square a square root.",How to Multiply Square Roots1," A radicand is a number underneath the radical sign.To multiply radicands, multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Make sure to keep the product under one radical sign.For example, if you are calculating 15×5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {15}}\times {\sqrt {5}}}, you would calculate 15×5=75{\displaystyle 15\times 5=75}. So, 15×5=75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {15}}\times {\sqrt {5}}={\sqrt {75}}}.
;
, To do this, see whether any perfect square is a factor of the radicand.If you cannot factor out a perfect square, your answer is already simplified and you need not do anything further.

A perfect square is the result of multiplying an integer (a positive or negative whole number) by itself.For example, 25 is a perfect square, because 5×5=25{\displaystyle 5\times 5=25}.

For example, 75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}} can be factored to pull out the perfect square 25:75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}}=25×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25\times 3}}}


, Keep the other factor under the radical sign. This will give you your simplified expression.

For example, 75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}} can be factored as 25×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25\times 3}}}, so you would pull out the square root of 25 (which is 5):75{\displaystyle {\sqrt {75}}}= 25×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25\times 3}}}= 53{\displaystyle 5{\sqrt {3}}}


, In some instances, you will need to multiply a square root by itself. Squaring a number and taking the square root of a number are opposite operations; thus, they undo each other. The result of squaring a square root, then, is simply the number under the radical sign.For example, 25×25=25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}\times {\sqrt {25}}=25}. You get that result because 25×25=5×5=25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}\times {\sqrt {25}}=5\times 5=25}.

Find the average of the two factors you are multiplying.,
Find the difference between each factor and their average.,
Recall the formula for the difference of two squares.,
Square a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.,
Calculate the difference between the two squares.",How to Multiply Two Digit Numbers Mentally1," To find the average, add both numbers together, then divide by 2. You can also think of this as the number that both factors are equidistant from.Note that this method only works if the average of the two factors is a whole number.

For example, if you are calculating 23×17{\displaystyle 23\times 17}, find the average of 23 and 17:23+172=402=20{\displaystyle {\frac {23+17}{2}}={\frac {40}{2}}=20}So, the average is 20. In other words, 23 and 17 are equidistant from 20.
;
, This difference should be the same for both numbers.

For example, since the average of 23 and 17 is 20, you would calculate 23−20=3{\displaystyle 23-20=3} and 20−17=3{\displaystyle 20-17=3}. So, the difference between each factor and their average is 3.


, The formula is (a+b)(a−b)=a2−b2{\displaystyle (a+b)(a-b)=a^{2}-b^{2}}For the purposes of multiplying two 2-digit numbers together, let a{\displaystyle a} equal the average of the two products, and b{\displaystyle b} equal the difference between each factor and their average.For example, (20+3)(20−3)=202−32{\displaystyle (20+3)(20-3)=20^{2}-3^{2}}.


, Remember that squaring a number means to multiply it by itself. Hopefully these numbers are easy for you to square in your head. If they aren’t, you might need to use another mental math method.

For example:(20+3)(20−3)=202−32{\displaystyle (20+3)(20-3)=20^{2}-3^{2}}(20+3)(20−3)=400−9{\displaystyle (20+3)(20-3)=400-9}


, The result will be the product of your original two factors.For example, (20+3)(20−3)=391{\displaystyle (20+3)(20-3)=391}. So, (23)(17)=391{\displaystyle (23)(17)=391}.

Multiply the coefficients.,
Multiply the radicands.,
Factor out any perfect squares in the radicand, if possible.,
Multiply the square root of the perfect square by the coefficient.",How to Multiply Square Roots2," A coefficient is a number in front of the radical sign. To do this, just ignore the radical sign and radicand, and multiply the two whole numbers. Place their product in front of the first radical sign.

Pay attention to positive and negative signs when multiplying coefficients. Don't forget that a negative times a positive is a negative, and a negative times a negative is a positive.

For example, if you are calculating 32×26{\displaystyle 3{\sqrt {2}}\times 2{\sqrt {6}}}, you would first calculate 3×2=6{\displaystyle 3\times 2=6}. So now your problem is 62×6{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {6}}}.


, To do this, multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Make sure to keep the product under the radical sign.

For example, if the problem is now 62×6{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {6}}}, to find the product of the radicands, you would calculate 2×6=12{\displaystyle 2\times 6=12}, so 2×6=12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {6}}={\sqrt {12}}}. The problem now becomes 612{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {12}}}.


, You need to do this to simplify your answer.If you cannot pull out a perfect square, your answer is already simplified and you can skip this step.

A perfect square is the result of multiplying an integer (a positive or negative whole number) by itself.For example, 4 is a perfect square, because 2×2=4{\displaystyle 2\times 2=4}.

For example, 12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {12}}} can be factored to pull out the perfect square 4:12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {12}}}=4×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4\times 3}}}


, Keep the other factor under the radicand. This will give you your simplified expression.

For example, 612{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {12}}} can be factored as 64×3{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {4\times 3}}}, so you would pull out the square root of 4 (which is 2) and multiply it by 6:612{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {12}}}= 64×3{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {4\times 3}}}= 6×23{\displaystyle 6\times 2{\sqrt {3}}}= 123{\displaystyle 12{\sqrt {3}}}

Determine which factor is closest to 100.,
Re-express the factor closest to 100 as 100−x{\displaystyle 100-x}.,
Substitute the re-expressed factor into the original equation.,
Multiply using the distributive property.,
Find the difference between the two products.",How to Multiply Two Digit Numbers Mentally2," This method works best when one of the factors is very close to 100, particularly when one of the factors is 99.But, this method may work for other factors as well.

For example, you might be multiplying 12×98{\displaystyle 12\times 98}. In this case, 98 is closest to 100.


, The variable x{\displaystyle x} represents the difference between the factor and 100.For example, 98=(100−2){\displaystyle 98=(100-2)}.


, You should think about multiplying 100−x{\displaystyle 100-x} by the smaller factor.

For example, 12×98=12(100−2){\displaystyle 12\times 98=12(100-2)}. 


, Since the first number in parentheses is 100, it should be easy to find the first factor. Finding the second factor is easier the closest the original number is to 100.

For example, 12×98=12(100−2)=1,200−24{\displaystyle 12\times 98=12(100-2)=1,200-24}.


, This will give you the product of your original two factors.For example, 1,200−24=1,176{\displaystyle 1,200-24=1,176}, so 12×98=1,176{\displaystyle 12\times 98=1,176}.

Determine whether either factor is even.,
Half the even number.,
Double the other number.,
Consider the new multiplication problem.,
Continue the process until you arrive at a problem you can compute mentally.",How to Multiply Two Digit Numbers Mentally3," You will be halving the even number.Remember that an even number is one that is divisible by 2. If both factors are even, choose the smaller number to halve.

For example, if you are multiplying 15×32{\displaystyle 15\times 32}, you would halve the 32, since it is an even number.


, To do this, divide by 2. If you know your math facts well, you should be able to do this easily.

For example, 322=16{\displaystyle {\frac {32}{2}}=16}.


, To double a number, multiply it by 2.

For example, 15×2=30{\displaystyle 15\times 2=30}.


, The new problem is the result of halving one of the factors and doubling the other.

For example, 15×32=30×16{\displaystyle 15\times 32=30\times 16}.


, Make sure you always halve the same number, and double the same number. The amount of times you halve and double should be same for both factors.For example:15×32{\displaystyle 15\times 32}=30×16{\displaystyle =30\times 16}=60×8{\displaystyle =60\times 8}=480{\displaystyle =480}

Define the largest integer to be summed as N. Summing integers from 1 to any given number N requires you to define N as a positive integer itself.,
Multiply N by (N+1) and divide by 2.,
Solve for your answer.,
Understand how the equation (N(N + 1))/2 is derived.,
Decide whether you're summing inclusively or exclusively.,
To find the sum of the integers between two numbers N1 and N2, find the sum for each value of N separately and subtract.,
Understand why this process works.",How to Sum the Integers from 1 to N," As a reminder, integers are whole numbers, so N cannot be a decimal or fraction. N also cannot be negative.


As an example, let's say we want to sum up all the integers from 1 to 100. In this case, we'll use 100 as our value for N because it's the final number in our series, or, in other words, the biggest number to be summed.

, When you've defined the integer value of N, plug it into the equation (N(N + 1))/2. This equation finds the sum of all the integers between 1 and N.


In our example, we would plug 100, our value for N, into the equation. (N(N + 1))/2 becomes (100(100 + 1))/2.

, The final value you obtain from this equation represents the sum of all the numbers between 1 and your value for N.


Let's solve our example problem.

(100(100 + 1))/2 =
(100(101))/2 =
(10100)/2 =
5,050. The sum of all integers from 1 to 100 is 5,050.



, Let's look at our example problem one more time. Mentally split the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + 99 + 100 into two groups - one from 1 to 50 and one from 51 to 100. If you add the first number in the first group (1) to the last number in the second group (100), you get 101. You also get 101 if you add 2 to 99, 3 to 98, 4 to 97, and so on. If we assign each number in the first group to the corresponding number in the second group in this way, we end up with 50 pairs of numbers that all add to the same thing - 101. So, 50 × 101 = 5,050, our sum for the integers from 1 - 100. Notice that 50 is half of 100 and that 101 is 100 + 1. In fact, this observation holds true for the sum of any positive integer - its component addition operations can be broken into two groups, then, the numbers in these groups can be assigned to each other in such a way that each pair adds to the same value. Note that odd integers will have one number left over - this doesn't affect the final answer.


In general terms, we can say that for any number N, the sum of the numbers from 1 to N is equal to (N/2)(N + 1). The simplified form of this equation is (N(N + 1))/2, our integer sum equation.

, Often, rather than being asked to find the sum of a range of integers from 1 to a given number, you'll be asked to find the sum of a range of integers between two integers N1 and N2, where N1 > N2 and both are > 1. The process that finds this sum is relatively simple, but, before undertaking it, you must determine whether the sum is to be inclusive or exclusive - in other words, whether it includes N1 and N2 or just the integers between them, as the process changes slightly based on this distinction.;
, Generally, all you need to do is subtract the sum of the smaller N value from the sum of the larger N value to find your answer. However, as noted above, it's important to know whether you're summing inclusively or exclusively. Inclusive summing requires you to subtract 1 from your value of N2 before plugging it into its equation, while summing exclusively requires you to subtract 1 from your value of N.1

Let's say that we're asked to inclusively find the sum of the integers between N1 = 100 and N2 = 75. In other words, we need to find 75 + 76 + 77 ... + 99 + 100. To do this, we would find the sum of the integers from 1 to N1, then subtract the sum of the integers from 1 to N2 - 1 (remember, when summing inclusively, we subtract 1 from N2), solving as follows:

(N1(N1 + 1))/2 - ((N2-1)((N2-1) + 1))/2 =
(100(100 + 1))/2 - (74(74 + 1))/2 =
5,050 - (74(75))/2 =
5,050 - 5,550/2 =
5,050 - 2,775 = 2,275. The inclusive sum of the integers between 75 and 100 is 2,275.


Now, let's try summing exclusively. Our equation is the same, except in this case we subtract 1 from N1 rather than N2:

((N1-1)((N1-1) + 1))/2 - (N2(N2 + 1))/2 =
(99(99 +1))/2 - (75(75 + 1))/2 =
(99(100))/2 - (75(76))/2 =
9,900/2 - 5,700/2 =
4,950 - 2,850 = 2,100. The exclusive sum of the integers between 75 and 100 is 2,100.



, Think of the sum of the integers from 1 to 100 as 1 + 2 + 3 ... + 98 + 99 + 100 and the sum of the integers from 1 to 75 as 1 + 2 + 3 ... + 73 + 74 + 75. Finding the sum of the integers between 75 and 100 inclusively means finding 75 + 76 + 77 ... + 99 + 100. The sums from 1 - 75 and 1 - 100 are the same up to 75 - at that point, the sum from 1 - 75 ""stops"" and the sum from 1 - 100 ""keeps on going"", with ... 75 + 76 + 77 ... + 99 + 100. Because of this, subtracting the sum of the integers from 1 - 75 from the sum of the integers from 1 - 100 allows us to ""isolate"" the sum of the integers from 75 - 100.


However, if we're summing inclusively, we must use the sum of 1 - 74, rather than the sum of 1 - 75, to ensure we include the number 75 itself in our final sum.
Similarly, if we're summing exclusively, we have to use the sum of 1 - 99, rather than the sum of 1 - 100, to ensure that the number 100 isn't included in the sum. We can use the sum of 1 - 75, because subtracting this from the sum of 1 - 99 excludes the number 75 from our final sum.

To start, one team throws in a card and the other team has to supply its pair or even trio before the time is over.",How to Master Multiplication Through Drills and Games," The three sets of cards explained in this tutorial will help your kids master multiplication through the drills and games explained here In addition, you can also use activities of your own making or inspired by games such as ""Happy Families"", ""Snap"" or ""Dominoes"", to name but a few.


Note that while most drills and games can be played individually, they are more fun played in group.;
, The tutor, parent/guardian, or teacher must get involved too. Monitor progress discreetly and join in the fun, especially when you are caught out, when the kids use their special way of thinking and the adult isn't ready for it!

Adults should spot weak areas in this multiplication journey and help kids overcome them by using graphs and charts up to their level, real things close to them and simple direct talk.











Use varied repetition accompanied by relaxing breaks.

, Have the kids help you ––involving the kids in the making of the teaching materials is of great importance to keep up their motivation to attain a variety of objectives.

The games revolve around using the 31 product and 36 factor cards ( small cards, see ""Things You'll Need"" below for details). These cards can be mastered as an enjoyable challenge within a group of friends. Return every now and then to drill the ""big cards"" (see below). Set a quick pace and focus on keeping the learning close to schoolwork.

, Products to elicit factors are both explained at Master Multiplication Without Learning the Tables. This must be read first.,

Big Cards. The eight possible sequences of products within this approach are:

2......4/6/8/10/12/14/16/18
3......6/9/12/15/18//21/24/27
4......8/12/16/20/24/28/32/36
5......10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45
6......12/18/24/30/36/42/48/54
7......14/21/28/25/42/49/56/63
8......16/24/32/40/48/56/64/72
9......18/27/36/45/54/63/72/81



, Cards are shuffled and handed round. The drill begins with the kid next to the dealer laying out any card that belongs to this sequence. As the answers are given away on the the side of the card, the drill will be completed in no time.

With the ""2"" sequence displayed on the table, kids are asked to say the factors following the actual wording they are used to using. As the clues are visible on the product side, they are bound to succeed, although they have to bear in mind that 12, 16 and 18 have two pairs of factors as the clues indicate.







, In each case, the dealer has to place all cards on the table, shuffle them and hand them round again, as you can only make one sequence at a time., For this version, you'll need Small Cards, Products and a timer (optional, at 10 seconds).

Shuffle the set of cards and hand them around.
The kid whose turn it is, lays down any product that belongs to the ""2"" sequence. If he/she fails, he/she misses a turn.
The kid who finishes a sequence without making an error is the new dealer.






Kids are expected to set the products in order while they are completing a sequence.
Proceed in a similar way from ""3"" to "" 9"".

, This is a slight variation on the previous game. A player throws in a product and the next adds, to the right right, a card supposedly related to the first one. Any card can be challenged but if the challenge turns out wrong, the challenger misses a turn. Whoever ends the sequence ( 8 cards), checks its order and calls out the corresponding factors and gets everything ready for the next sequence.

,, The kid who is the dealer lays a card, the next another and the third the last one of a trio. The following kid has to give his/her opinion along these lines: All cards are okay, (81,18, 45); the trio is no good (27,12,10) or this specific card is wrong (9, 8,12). The answer: 9. As usual, all answers can be challenged by other players.

Do not use 1 times table nor 10 times for this game.

,, By folding a little piece of the same squared/graph paper, have them make a mark for an origin and then a ""10"" vertical slant. By moving the ruler along this line, have them mark the tens and write in the corresponding figures.

Next have them mark on the ruler the five unit intervals and mark little dots or slashes along the number line. However, this time do it without writing in the fives, just to make it neater and less crowded.







, And they can chant, as well, in a kind of slow motion, as they check the times along the line., This gives everybody the same chance "" to come to the front"". Proceed in a likewise manner with the rest of the digits.

Make kids use the square/graph paper ruler in order not to have them counting unit by unit, and do proper skip-counting.

, In this way, you have a new sequence that will help the kids. Leave out the 1 and 100, so the sequence would be: 4, 9,16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81. Draw and colour the sequence, to have it written out in full. Add 1 and 100 to give the chart an look of unity.,, The purpose of this activity is to make kids associate related cards. The dominoes can adopt any shapes. The kid who uses up all his/her cards is the winner. All cards can be challenged., You'll also need a timer., The first team will have the product cards and the other team the factor cards., Hand them out to the members within each team., All fails are counted to determine the winning team.

Write down the larger number.,
Write the smaller number directly below it.,
Subtract the number in the ones column of the bottom number from the number in the ones column of the top number.,
Subtract the number in the tens column of the bottom number from the number in the tens column of the top number.,
Check your work.",How to Subtract1," Let's say you're working with the problem 32 - 17. Write down 32 first.;
, Make sure that you line up the tens and ones columns, so that the 3 in ""32"" is directly above the 1 in ""17"" and that the 2 in ""32"" is directly above the ""7"" in 17.

, Now, this can get a little bit tricky when the bottom number is larger than the top number. In this case, 7 is larger than 2. Here's what you need to do:


You'll need to ""borrow"" from the 3 in ""32"" (also known as regrouping), in order to turn that 2 into a 12.
Cross off the 3 in ""32"" and make it a 2, while making the 2 a 12.
Now, you have 12 - 7, which is equal to 5. Write a 5 below the two numbers you subtracted, so it lines up with the ones column in a new row.

, Remember that your 3 is now a 2. Now, subtract the 1 in 17 from the 2 above it to get (2-1) 1. Write 1 below the numbers in the tens columns, to the left of the 5 in the ones column of the answer. You should have written 15. This means that 32 - 17 = 15.

, If you want to be sure that you correctly subtracted the two numbers, then all you have to do is to add the answer to the smaller number to make sure that you get the larger number. In this case, you should add your answer, 15, to the smaller number in the subtraction number, 17. 15 + 17 = 32, so you've done your work correctly. Well done!

Identify which number is larger.,
Decide whether your answer will be positive or negative.,
Find the gap between the two numbers.",How to Subtract2," A problem such as 15 - 9 will need a different visualization technique than a problem like 2 - 30.


In the problem 15 - 9, the first number, 15, is larger than the second, 9.
In the problem 2 - 30, the second number, 30, is larger than the first, 2.

, If the first number is larger, the answer is positive. If the second number is larger, the answer will be negative.


In the first problem, 15 - 9, your answer will be positive because the first number is larger than the second.
In the second problem, 2 - 30, your answer will be negative because the second number is larger than the first.

, In order to subtract the two numbers, you'll have to visualize the gap between the two numbers and count the numbers in between.


For the problem 15 - 9, visualize a pile of 15 poker chips. Remove 9 of them and you'll see that 6 of them remain. Therefore, 15 - 9 = 6. You can also think of a number line. Think of the numbers from 1 to 15 and then remove or go back 9 units to get 6.
For the problem 2 - 30, the easiest thing to do is to reverse the numbers and then make the answer negative after you've subtracted them. So, 30 - 2 = 28, since 28 is just two less than 30. Now, make your answer negative since you determined at the beginning that it would be negative because the second number is larger than the first. Therefore, 2 - 30 = -28.

Check your work.",How to Subtract3," Let's say you're working with the following problem: 10.5 - 8.3. Write 10.5 above 8.3 so that the decimal points of both numbers are lined up. The .5 in 10.5 should be over the .3 in 8.3, and the 0 in 10.5 should be over the 8 in 8.3.


If you have a problem where both numbers don't have the same amount of numbers after the decimal point, write a 0 in the empty spaces until they even out. For example, if you have the problem 5.32 - 4.2, you can rewrite it as 5.32 = 4.20. This won't change the value of the second number while making it possible to subtract both numbers more easily.

, You should follow the same process you'd follow when subtracting regular whole numbers, except that you need to remember to line up the decimals of both numbers and to keep the decimal in your answer. In this case, you need to subtract 3 from 5. 5 - 3 = 2, so you should write a 2 below the 3 in 8.3.


Make sure to carry that decimal point down to the answer. It should read .2 so far.

, Now, you'll need to subtract 8 from 0. Borrow from the 1 next to the 0 to make it a 10, and subtract 8 from 10 (10 - 8) to get 2. You can also just think of it as subtracting 8 from 10 without borrowing since there's no number in the tens column of the second number. Write the answer down below the 8, to the left of the decimal point.

, Your final answer is 2.2.

, If you want to make sure you subtracted decimals correctly, then all you have to do is to add your answer and the smaller number to make sure that you get the larger number. 2.2 + 8.3 = 10.5 so you're all done.

Find the lowest common denominator.,
Rewrite the fractions with the same denominators.,
Subtract the numerators of both fractions.,
Write the new numerator over the same denominator to get your final answer.,
Check your work.",How to Subtract4," Let's say you're working with the problem 13/10 - 3/5. Write down the problem so that both numerators, 13 and 3, and both denominators, 10 and 5, are directly across from each other. The two numbers will be separated by a subtraction sign. This will help you visualize the problem and reach a solution more easily.

, The lowest common denominator is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers. In this example, you'll need to find the lowest common denominator of the numbers 10 and 5. You can see that 10 is the lowest common denominator of both numbers, because 10 is evenly divisible by both 10 and 5.


Note that the lowest common denominator of two numbers isn't always one of the numbers. For example, the lowest common denominator of the numbers 3 and 2 is 6, because that's the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers.

, The fraction 13/10 can be written the same way, since the denominator, 10, goes into the lowest common denominator, 10, exactly 1 time. However, the fraction 3/5 needs to be rewritten because the denominator, 5, goes into the lowest common denominator, 10, 2 times. So, the fraction 3/5 needs to be multiplied by 2/2 in order to have 10 in the denominator. therefore, 3/5 x 2/2 = 6/10. You've created an equivalent fraction. 3/5 is equal to 6/10, though 6/10 allows you to subtract the number from the first number, 13/10.


Write the new problem like this: 13/10 - 6/10.

, Simply subtract 13 - 6 to get 7. You should not change the denominators of the fractions.

, Your new numerator is 7. Both fractions have the denominator 10. Your final answer is therefore 7/10.

, If you want to make sure that you subtracted the fractions correctly, just add up your answer and the smaller fraction to make sure that your answer is the larger fraction. So, 7/10 + 6/10 = 13/10. You're all done.

Understand how to read a times table.,
Determine how many factors you need in your times table.,
Use a ruler to create 12 rows and 12 columns.,
Label the columns and rows 1-12.,
Fill in the products for each multiplication sentence with a factor of 1.,
Fill in the rest of the second row.,
Fill in the remaining rows.,
Check your table.",How to Make a Multiplication Chart1," A times table shows the products of sequential factors. Each column is labeled with one factor, and each row is labeled with another factor. The cell where the row and column meet gives you the product of the two factors.

, The standard times table is for factors 1-12, but your teacher may only require you to memorize a table for factors 1-10, depending on what grade you are in.
, You can also find a blank table online and print it, or use graph paper.It’s best to keep your table very neat, so that you don’t confuse factors.

When you make your table, be sure to keep room to the top and left of it so that you can label your rows and columns.


, The column to the left should be labeled “1,” and the other columns labeled in order up to 12. The top row should also be labeled “1,” and the other rows labeled in order down to 12.
, Since any number times 1 equals that number, you can quickly fill in the first row and first column of your times table, since these will all equal the number being multiplied by 1.

For example, in the top row, you would fill in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, since 1×1=1{\displaystyle 1\times 1=1}, 2×1=2{\displaystyle 2\times 1=2}, 3×1=3{\displaystyle 3\times 1=3}, etc. The first column follows the same pattern, since it shows 1×1=1{\displaystyle 1\times 1=1}, 1×2=2{\displaystyle 1\times 2=2}, 1×3=3{\displaystyle 1\times 3=3}, etc.


, The second row represents 2×x{\displaystyle 2\times x}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals each factor you are multiplying by 2, from 2-12.

For example, 2×2=4{\displaystyle 2\times 2=4}, 2×3=6{\displaystyle 2\times 3=6}, 2×4=8{\displaystyle 2\times 4=8}, etc.


, In each row, you are multiplying that row’s factor by each factor represented in the columns. A quick way to fill in each row using mental math is to add that row’s factor to each product.For example, the numbers in the third row will be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36. The numbers in the fourth row will be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48. Note that for the third row, which represents the factor 3, you simply add 3 to each product to get the next product. For the fourth row, which represents the factor 4, you add 4 to each product to get the next product.


, You can verify all of your numbers are correct by using a calculator. You can also check your table against one in your math textbook or online."

Remember that the digits of your answer should all add up to 9.,
Remember that the tens digit of 9 x some number will be some number minus one.",How to Use Your Fingers to Do the 9s Times Tables," The finger trick will allow you to calculate the times table from 9 x 1 to 9 x 10. Multiplying 9 by any larger number cannot be done using the finger trick. The finger trick also cannot be used to multiply 9 by fractions or any other number that is not an integer.If you need to multiply 9 by any larger number, you can calculate the problem using a pencil and paper or use a calculator to solve the problem for you.;
, Make sure that your fingers are pointing up, that your hands are next to one another, and that your palms are facing away from your body. Your hands are the basis for calculating the 9s times table., Begin with the pinkie of your left hand. This finger should be the finger that is furthest left. Call your left pinkie ""1."" Then call your left ring finger ""2,"" and the middle finger of your left hand ""3."" Continue counting up from left to right for all 10 fingers. The thumb of your right hand should be labeled ""6"" and the pinkie of your right hand should be labeled ""10"" if you have done this correctly., Take a moment to think about which multiplication problem you are going to solve. Sometimes you might need to solve a problem that is assigned to you--for example, your teacher might ask you to solve the problem 9 x 6. Sometimes, you will have to determine the terms of the problem yourself, for example, if you wish to purchase 9 candy bars that cost $2.00 each. To determine how much you will be spending, you will have to multiply 9 x 2.

, Take a look at your hands and your fingers. When you multiply 9 x 1, you will fold down your finger that was assigned the ""1"" spot: your left pinkie. When you multiply 9 x 2, you will fold down the finger that is second from the left: your left ring finger. When you multiply 9 x 6, you will fold down your finger in the ""6"" spot: your right thumb. Remember that you can solve any multiplication problem from 9 x 1 to 9 x 10 in this manner. Keep the proper finger folded as you move on to the next step in your calculation.

, Ask yourself how many fingers are standing up to the left of the folded finger. For example, if you are solving the problem of 9 x 6, there should be five fingers (all the fingers on your left hand) standing up to the left of the folded sixth finger (your right thumb). If you are solving the problem of 9 x 1, there should be zero fingers standing up to the left of the folded first finger (your left pinkie).

, Most of the answers from the 9s times tables are two-digit numbers. The only exception is 9 x 1, whose answer is the single-digit number 9. The tens spot in your answer is determined by the number of fingers to the left of the folded finger.For example, if you are solving 9 x 6, you will see that you have five fingers to the left of the folded finger. This means that your answer will be fifty-something. In order to determine the precise answer, you will have to continue to the next step.

, Take a look at your hands, with the proper finger still folded. Count the number of fingers that are to the right of the folded finger. This is the ""ones"" component in your answer.For example, if you are solving 9 x 6, you will see that you have four fingers to the right of the folded finger. This means that the ones digit in your answer will be 4.

, By stitching together the number of fingers to the left of your folded finger (the tens spot) and the number of fingers to the right of your folded finger (the ones spot), you will get your final answer for that times table.


For example, if you are solving for 9 x 6, you will have 5 fingers to the left of the folded ""6"" finger and 4 fingers to the right of it. The 5 is in the tens spot and the 4 is in the ones spot. Put it together to get 54, which is the correct answer.
If, however, you are solving for 9 x 8, you will have 7 fingers to the left of the folded ""8"" finger (your right middle finger) and 2 fingers to the right of it. The 7 is in the tens spot and the 2 is in the ones spot. Put it together to get 72, which is the correct answer.

, Until you have the hang of the 9s times tables, you might want to take a few moments to check your work. For example, you might use a calculator to make sure that you are using the finger trick correctly. You can also use the repeated addition method, where you simply add together the proper number of groups of 9. (9 x 4 is the same is 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36).


There are a few other rules about the 9s times tables that can help keep you on the right track. These special qualities about 9s make it particularly easy to determine whether you have gotten the right answer using the finger trick.

, The nines times table has the great trick that the digits of your answer always add up to 9.This works as follows:

9 x 1 = 09. 0 + 9 = 9
9 x 2 = 18. 1 + 8 = 9
9 x 3 = 27. 2 + 7 = 9
9 x 4 = 36. 3 + 6 = 9. etc.

, For example, the tens digit of 9 x 3 will be 3-1, or 2. Therefore the answer to 9 x 3 should begin with 2. Use this pattern to help keep you on track: if you find that your answer to 9 x 2 begins with a 4 (and not a 1), you know you have gone astray somewhere."

This presents all the information out in front of them at one time. In the beginning, let them work off this table in front of them. They can follow the columns and rows until they find their answers. Over time, this will likely lead them to memorization without them even really trying.


It's up to you how many factors you want to present them with. A multiplication table up to 6 may be all you want to do right now. However, if you have a particularly bright group of kids, you may be able to get away with a chart that goes all the way up to 12.;
, Show them that 2x3 is the exact same thing as 2+2+2, or 3 groups of 2. This makes it less intimidating since they already know how to add.


Emphasize that multiplication is a shortcut. For instance, write down five 2s and then add them together to get 10. Then show them 2 x 5 is really adding two five times. Usually when students learn that there's a short cut, they will take it.
Let them use their multiplications tables at first. Then wean them from them gradually. The students who are more math-savvy will get bored quickly with these charts, so give them extra credit questions if necessary. The students who don't catch onto it as quickly will appreciate the crutch and appreciate that you care enough about them to help them through it.

, In the UK, ""Numicon,"" which shows the numbers from 1 to 10 in blocks with that number of holes, and Cuisenaire rods are popular. However, you can use just about anything that's small, even food.


For example, if there are 3 cups and each cup has 4 pencils in it then there are a total of 12 pencils. Show the students that the number of pencils in each cup adds together to a total of the number of cups multiplied by the number of pencils that are contained within them. Illustrate the connection between the math that they have already learned and the math that they are being taught.

, You should start with 3 because they have likely been learning 1s and 2s since first grade. However, if they need a kick to be shown how simple it is, consider backtracking to these numbers. That being said, there's not much to do with 1s. Get a feel for the group you're working with. What are they ready for?


Start with 3 x 2. Place 3 beans in each of your two hands. Explain that 3 x 2 is the same as two groups of 3, or 3 + 3. How many beans are there? Now what if you had a student come up and hold beans with you in his or her right hand? How many beans would there be then? What would that equation be?

, Once they have the basic concept, these numbers are essentially the same. It's a combination of math and addition skills and rote memorization. Continue using your blocks, beans, rods, or whatever other implement you're using to illustrate the groupings and numbers.


Many teachers are fond of time tests. You could also turn this into a game creating teams, using flashcards, and having them race to the board. Make sure to work in both directions – i.e., 4 x 7 and 7 x 4.

, There are actually many tricks for nine. Tell them if they already know tens, they can do this. Here are two ideas:


If 10+10 is twenty, subtract two from twenty, and you have eighteen! Let's try a higher equation, like 10 x 4 = 40. Subtract one group of 4 and you have 36, or 9 x 4. 10 x 5 is 50, but subtract one group of five and you have 45, or 9 x 5. Just subtract one group of the number that isn't ten and that's the answer for nine.
Teach them a simple hand trick. First put up your ten fingers in front of you. Then take whichever number you need to multiply by nine and count that on your fingers. So if you are multiplying 9 x 7, you just count your ten fingers from left to right and when you get to your 7th finger, fold it down. Then you have your answer! You will then have 6 fingers to the left and 3 fingers on the right ( your folded down 7th finger separates the two different numbers). So with 6 fingers on the left and 3 on the right your answer is 63! This works with any number divided by 9 (just replace the 7 in this example with whichever number you're multiplying by 9). It's an easy trick to master for one of the hardest single numbers in multiplication to memorize.

, Don't give much attention to 10, because they have likely been learning that or can see how simple it is – just add a zero. But when it comes to 11, remind them that if 10 x 5 is 50, then 11 times five is 55.


12 is where many teachers stop when it comes to basic multiplication learning. However, if you want to give them a challenge, keep going up through 20. It's fine if they slow down as the problems get harder and harder. But as they get harder and harder, make sure it stays fun.

, The standard way to teach multiplication is memorization, which only some children are good at – and it's debatable if you can classify this as learning, anyway. Make it interactive as much as possible. Use fingers and toes, blocks, an abacus, whatever you have on hand. Make it fun, not something that's discouraging.


Please do not shame kids by having them recite in front of the class – it will never improve their memory but it will turn them off math forever and create an unpleasant disparity among students.

, With this method, students will need to know how to skip-count, which is essentially the same as multiplication. For example, skip-counting by multiples of 4 goes as follows: 4, 8,12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40. 3 x 4 = skip-count by 4 three times: 4, 8, 12.


A harder example? 6 x 7 = skip-count by 7 six times: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42. The answer is 42. The best way to learn skip-counting is through the use of songs or other mnemonic devices. Skip-counting by multiples is also the primary method for multiplying single digits by remedial math systems such as Simple Math and Touch Math.

, Here's an idea: use a beach ball (or two). Take a permanent black marker and divide the ball in half horizontally. This will give you 12 sections. Using the same marker, number the sections from 0 through 11 randomly. Here's how the game is played:


You write a number 1 through 10 on the board (preferably the number you are working on in the classroom.)
Any child in the room tosses the ball to another child. This child instantly calls out the number their right thumb is on.
Both children compete in trying to be the first to say the answer, multiplying the number on the board by the number called out by the child who caught the ball.
The winner continues the game by throwing the ball to another child. Have the child who throws the ball say the name of the child that they are tossing it to. This eliminates a mad scramble for many to rush to catch the ball.
Pro tip? Let some air out of the ball. It is easier for third graders to catch and it doesn't cause chaos by bouncing all over the room.

, Instead of saying ""four times three is...?"" try saying, ""four, three times is...?"" Try pointing out that the multiplication process is taking a number and re adding it the number of times your multiplying it by. You are just saying it in a way kids would understand more easily.


Once they have a grip on it, change up how you say the problem, and what problems you ask them. Make it random and not following a pattern. Kids are like sponges when it comes to learning if you make it interesting.

, You'll want to convert the number 5 into a fraction with the denominator of 4 in order to subtract the two numbers. So, you can first think of 5 as a fraction that is really 5/1. Then, you can multiply both the top and bottom of the new fraction by 4 in order to create two fractions with the same denominator. So, 5/1 x 4/4 = 20/4. This fraction is really equal to 5, but it allows you to subtract two fractions.

, The new problem can be written like this: 20/4 - 3/4.

, Now, you can simply subtract 3 from 20 to get the final answer. 20 - 3 = 17, so 17 is your new numerator. You can keep the denominator as it is.

, Your final answer is 17/4. If you'd like to state it as a mixed number, simply divide 17 by 4 to get 4, with 1 left over as the remainder. This will make your final answer 17/4 equal to 4 1/4.

3x2 - 2x2 = x2

-5x - 2x = -7x
2y - y = y
-z - 0 = -z

, Now that you've subtracted all of the like terms you can subtract, all you can do is state your final answer, which will contain each of the terms that you subtracted. Here's the final answer:

, Some binary subtraction problems are no different than base ten subtraction. Line up the columns and, starting from the right, find the result for each digit. Here are a few easy examples:


1 - 0 = 1
11 - 10 = 1
1011 - 10 = 1001

, You only need to know one special ""rule"" to complete any binary subtraction problem. This rule tells you how to ""borrow"" from the digit to the left so you can solve a ""0 - 1"" column. For the rest of this section, we'll set up a couple example problems and solve them using the borrow method. Here's the first:


110 - 101 = ?

, Starting from the right column (the ones place), we need to solve the problem ""0 - 1."" In order to do this, we need to ""borrow"" from the digit to the left (the twos place). This has two steps to it:


First, cross out the 1 and replace it with a 0, to get this: 1010 - 101 = ?
You've subtracted 10 from the first number, so you can add this ""borrowed"" number to the ones place: 101100 - 101 = ?


, Now each column can be solved as usual. Here's how to solve the rightmost column (the ones place) in this problem:


101100 - 101 = ?
The rightmost column is now: 10 - 1 = 1. If you can't figure out how to reach this answer, here's how to convert the problem back to decimal:
102 = (1 x 2) + (0 x 1) = 210. (The sub numbers indicate which base the number is written in.)
12 = (1x1) = 110.
Therefore, in decimal form this problem is 2 - 1 = ?, so the answer is 1.

, The rest of the problem can now be solved easily. Solve it column by column, moving from right to left:


101100 - 101 = __1 = _01 = 001 = 1.

, Borrowing comes up a lot in binary multiplication, and sometimes you'll need to borrow multiple times just to solve one column. For example, here's how to solve 11000 - 111. We can't ""borrow"" from a 0, so we need to keep borrowing from the left until we turn it into something we can borrow from:


10110000 - 111 =

10111001000 - 111 = (remember, 10 - 1 = 1)
10111001100100 - 111 =
Here it is written more tidily: 1011100 - 111 =

Solve column by column: _ _ _ _ 1 = _ _ _ 0 1 = _ _ 0 0 1 = _ 0 0 0 1 = 1 0 0 0 1


, There are three ways to check your answer.One quick way is to find a binary calculator online and plug in the problem. The other two methods are still useful, since you may need to check by hand on a test, and they will make you more familiar and comfortable with binary numbers:



Add in binary to check your work. Add the answer together with the smaller number, and you should get the larger number. Using our last example (11000 - 111 = 10001), we get 10001 + 111 = 11000, which is the larger number we started with.
Alternatively, convert each number from binary to decimal and see whether it is true. Using the same example (11000 - 111 = 10001), we can convert each number into decimal and get 24 - 7 = 17. This is a true statement, so our solution is correct.

Understand how to read this type of chart.,
Determine how many factors you need in your chart.,
Create 12 tables.,
Fill in the first column of the first table.,
Fill in the first column of the remaining tables.,
Fill in the second column of each table.,
Fill in the multiplication and equals signs for each multiplication sentence.,
Fill in the final column of each table.",How to Make a Multiplication Chart2," This type of chart is made up of separate tables for each factor. Each table shows the sequence of products when you multiply this factor by other numbers.

For example, this type of chart has a table showing all the products of the factor 1, another table for all the products of the factor 2, another table for all the products of the factor 3, etc.

Unlike a times table, this type of chart shows the number sentences for each factor.


, The standard multiplication chart is for factors 1-12, but you might need to create a chart with fewer or more factors, depending on your teacher’s requirements.
, Each table should have 12 rows and 3 columns. All 12 tables should fit on one piece of paper. Make sure your table is neat by using ruler to create the lines. It is also best to use graph paper, or you can make your chart in a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.
, Each cell in this column will have a number 1, since this is the table for the factor 1.
, In the first column of each table, you will simply repeat whatever factor that table represents. So the second table should have a 2 in each cell, the third table should have a 3 in each cell, etc.
, In the second column you will write each factor, from 1-12. This column will be the same in each table.
, The multiplication sign will come between the two factors. The equals sign will come after the second factor.

For example, in the first table, you should have:1×1={\displaystyle 1\times 1=}1×2={\displaystyle 1\times 2=}1×3={\displaystyle 1\times 3=}1×4={\displaystyle 1\times 4=}1×5={\displaystyle 1\times 5=}1×6={\displaystyle 1\times 6=}etc.


, This column will show the product of each multiplication sentence. To fill in this column quickly, simply add whatever factor that table represents to each product.For example, the products for the 5s table are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 10, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60. Notice that for each new product, you are adding 5 to the product that came before.


"
"
Review it daily.,
Look for patterns.,
Memorize it in chunks.,
Make a new chart from memory.",How to Make a Multiplication Chart3," To help you memorize the chart, aim for reviewing it for at least five minutes each day. Review the table by reading over it and by quizzing yourself. You can have someone else quiz you, or you can use an online program, such as the Math Trainer found at Math is Fun., Finding patterns in the numbers can help you better remember your times tables.Think about how the numbers relate to each other moving from left-to-right, up and down, or diagonally.

Note that the order of the multiplication does not matter. For example, 4×5=20{\displaystyle 4\times 5=20} and 5×4=20{\displaystyle 5\times 4=20}.

Notice that when a factor is doubled, its product is doubled. For example, compare the fourth row of the times table with the eight row. Compare the fifth row with the tenth row.If you look at the times table for the factor 5, you should see that when you multiply 5 by an odd number, the product ends in 5, and when you multiply 5 by an even number, the product ends in a 0.Note that when you multiply any single-digit factor (1-9) by 11, the product has that digit in the ones and the tens place. For example, 4×11=44{\displaystyle 4\times 11=44} and 7×11=77{\displaystyle 7\times 11=77}.

The table for the factor 9 has many patterns. When you add the digits of any product, their sum equals 9.Also, as you move up the times table, the digit in the ones place goes down by 1., If you try to memorize the entire times table at the same time, you’ll have a difficult time retaining all of the numbers. It’s better to divide the table up into several sections and study each section until you have it memorized.

For example, you might first memorize your multiplication facts from 1x1{\displaystyle 1x1} down to 6x6{\displaystyle 6x6} (the top left corner of the chart). Then you can memorize your facts from 1x7{\displaystyle 1x7} to 6x12{\displaystyle 6x12} (the top right corner of the chart. Then you can memorize your facts from 7x1{\displaystyle 7x1} to 12x6{\displaystyle 12x6} (the bottom left corner). Finally, you can memorize your facts from 7x7{\displaystyle 7x7} to 12x12{\displaystyle 12x12} (the bottom right corner)., The best way to see how much you’ve memorized is to create a new chart without using a calculator or any other help. You should also try to fill in products automatically, without doing any mental math.

Set a time limit, such as 3 minutes, and see whether you can fill in the entire chart in that amount of time. Each time, see if you can fill in the chart faster.

When you practice making a new chart, fill in the easy calculations first. Skip any product that doesn’t come to you right away. When the time limit is up, you know that you need to work on memorizing the products you could not fill in.

Align the two numbers as you would in decimal subtraction.,
Append leading zeros if necessary to represent both numbers with the same number of digits.,
Switch the digits in the second term.,
Add one to the new second term.,
Solve the new problem as a binary addition problem.,
Discard the first digit.,
Try this method in base ten.",How to Subtract Binary Numbers2," This method is used by computers to subtract binary numbers, since it uses a more efficient program. For a human used to ordinary decimal subtraction problems, this is probably the more difficult method to use, but could be useful to understand as a programmer.We'll use the example 101 - 11 = ?


, For example, convert 101-11 to 101-011 so that both have three digits.


101 - 011 = ?

, Change all the 0s to 1s and all the 1s to 0s in the second term. In our example, the second term becomes: 011 → 100.


What we're actually doing is ""taking the one's complement,"" or subtracting each digit in the term from one. The ""switching"" shortcut works in binary, since the only two possibilities result in switching the term: 1 - 0 = 1 and 1 - 1 = 0.

, Once you have the ""reversed"" term, add one to the result. In our example, we get 100 + 1 = 101.

, Use binary adding techniques to add the new term to the original term, instead of subtracting:


101 + 101 = 1010
If this does not make sense to you, review how to add binary numbers.

, This method should always end up with an answer one digit too long. For example, our example problem involved three-digit numbers (101 + 101), but we ended up with a four digit solution (1010). Simply cross out the first digit, and you'll have the answer to the original subtraction problem:1010 = 10

Therefore, 101 - 011 = 10

If you don't have an extra digit, you tried to subtract a larger number from a smaller one. See the tips section for how to solve problems like that, and start again.

, This method is called the ""two's complement"" method, since the ""reverse the digits"" steps results in the ""one's complement,"" and then the number 1 is added.If you'd like a more intuitive understanding of why this method works, try it in base ten:


56 - 17
Since we're using base ten, we'll take the ""nine's complement"" of the second term (17) by subtracting each digit from nine. 99 - 17 = 82.
Change this into an addition problem: 56 + 82. If you compare this to the original problem (56 - 17), you can see that we've added 99.
56+82=138. But since our changes added 99 to the original problem, we'll need to subtract 99 from the answer. Again, we'll use a shortcut, just like in the binary method above: add 1 to the total number, then delete the digit on the left (which represents 100):

138 + 1 = 139 → 139 → 39 This is finally the solution to our original problem, 56-17.

Factor each radicand into prime numbers.An easy way to factor a number is by creating a factor tree diagram.,
Rewrite the expression.,
Circle pairs of like factors under each radical.,
Factor out coefficients by identifying paired factors under each radical.,
Rewrite your problem, using the simplified terms.,
Place a 1 in front of any square root that doesn’t already have a coefficient.,
Check for square roots with the same radicand.,
Add the coefficients.,
Add any unlike radicands to the expression.",How to Add Square Roots," Read Do a Factor Tree for complete instructions.

A radicand is the number under the radical sign.

A prime number is a number that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself,for example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

You do NOT need to factor any coefficients. A coefficient is a number in front of the radical sign.

Let’s say, for example, that you want to add 20+445+5+7.{\displaystyle {\sqrt {20}}+4{\sqrt {45}}+{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {7}}.}To do this, you need to factor 20{\displaystyle 20} as 2×2×5{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 5}. You also need to factor 45{\displaystyle 45} as 3×3×5{\displaystyle 3\times 3\times 5}. 

If a radicand is already a prime number, it does not need to be factored. For example, since 5{\displaystyle 5} and 7{\displaystyle 7} are already prime numbers, 5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} and 7{\displaystyle {\sqrt {7}}} do not need to be factored.
;
, Keep all the factors under the radical sign.

For example, after factoring the radicands, the example expression would be2×2×5+43×3×5+5+7.{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2\times 2\times 5}}+4{\sqrt {3\times 3\times 5}}+{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {7}}.}


, Since you are finding a square root, by pairing up like factors, you can easily simplify the expression.

For example, 2×2×5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2\times 2\times 5}}} has a pair of 2s, so draw a circle around them. 43×3×5{\displaystyle 4{\sqrt {3\times 3\times 5}}} has a pair of 3s, so draw a circle around them.


, The square root of any pair of factors will equal the factor, because x×x=x2{\displaystyle x\times x=x^{2}} and x2=x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x^{2}}}=x}. Place this number in front of the radical sign. If the expression already has a coefficient, multiply the two numbers.For example:2×2×5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2\times 2\times 5}}}=45{\displaystyle ={\sqrt {4}}{\sqrt {5}}}=25{\displaystyle =2{\sqrt {5}}}So, 20{\displaystyle {\sqrt {20}}} simplifies to 25{\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {5}}}.


43×3×5{\displaystyle 4{\sqrt {3\times 3\times 5}}}=4×95{\displaystyle =4\times {\sqrt {9}}{\sqrt {5}}}=(4×3)5{\displaystyle =(4\times 3){\sqrt {5}}}=125{\displaystyle =12{\sqrt {5}}}So, 445{\displaystyle 4{\sqrt {45}}}simplifies to 125{\displaystyle 12{\sqrt {5}}}.


, This will make the adding process much easier.

For example:20+445+5+7{\displaystyle {\sqrt {20}}+4{\sqrt {45}}+{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {7}}} simplifies to25+125+5+7{\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {5}}+12{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {7}}}


, The 1 is always understood, and so is rarely written. However, when adding, writing the 1 can help you keep track of coefficients.

A coefficient is the number in front of the radical sign.

For example, write 5{\displaystyle {\sqrt {5}}} as 15{\displaystyle 1{\sqrt {5}}}.


, You can only add square roots that have the same radicand.

The radicand is the number underneath the radical sign.

For example, you can add the first three terms in the expression 25+125+5+7{\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {5}}+12{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {7}}}, because they all have the same radicand (5).


, Only add the coefficients for terms that have the same radicand. Do NOT add the radicands.

For example, 25+125+15=155{\displaystyle 2{\sqrt {5}}+12{\sqrt {5}}+1{\sqrt {5}}=15{\sqrt {5}}}.


, These cannot be simplified any further, and cannot be added to any other terms. The result will be your final, simplified answer.

For example, 155+7{\displaystyle 15{\sqrt {5}}+{\sqrt {7}}}.

Add the whole numbers together.,
Find the lowest common denominator (LCD) of both fractions.The LCD is the lowest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers.,
Convert the fractions to have the LCD as their denominator.,
Add the fractions.,
Convert any improper fractions into mixed numbers.,
Add the sum of the whole numbers and the sum of the fractions.",How to Add Mixed Numbers1," The whole numbers are 1 and 2, so 1 + 2 =3.;
, Since the denominators of the fractions are 2 and 4, the LCD is 4, because 4 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 2 and 4.

, Before you can add the fractions, they have to have 4 as their denominator, so you have to make the fractions maintain their value while having a new base. Here's how to do it:


Since the denominator of the fraction 1/2 has to be multiplied by 2 to get 4 as the new base, you should multiply the numerator 1 by 2 as well. 1 * 2 = 2, so the new fraction is 2/4. The fraction 2/4 = 1/2, but has been put in a larger ratio to have a larger base. This means that the numbers are equivalent fractions. They have a different base, but their value remains the same.
Since the fraction 3/4 already has the base of 4, you don't have to change it.

, Once you have a common denominator, the fractions can be added by simply adding the numerators.


2/4 + 3/4 = 5/4

, An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator is equal to or larger than the denominator. You need to convert the improper fraction into a mixed number before you can add it to the sum of the whole numbers. Since the original problem used mixed numbers, your answer should use mixed numbers too. Here's how to do it:


First, divide the numerator by the denominator. Do long division to divide 4 into 5. 4 goes into 5 1 time. This means that the quotient is 1. The remainder, or the number that is left over, is 1.
Make your quotient the new whole number. Take your remainder and place it over the original denominator to finish converting the improper fraction into a mixed number. The quotient is 1, the remainder is 1, and the original denominator was 4, so the final answer is 1 1/4.

, To get your final answer, you have to add the two sums you found. 1 + 2 = 3 and 1/2 + 3/4 = 1 1/4, so 3 + 1 1/4 = 4 1/4.

Write any two or more multi-digit numbers in a vertical column.,
Start on the column farthest to the right.,
Carry the extra digit.,
Group the numbers into larger units by rearranging them into units of ten.",How to Add Large Numbers1," This method is sometimes called ""the traditional method."" It involves adding the numbers in units of single digits, then by units of tens, then by units of hundreds. This is accomplished by working from right to left.Start by adding the figures 383 + 412 + 122.


Draw a line below the numbers. This line is equivalent to the equal sign in linear math. You will write your final sum below this line, starting on the right and moving to the left.
Careful placement of each number is essential in this method. Make sure you are careful to place each number directly below the one above it. That is, 3, 1, and 2 should each be in a column of their own - these are the single digits. 8, 2, and 2 should be in a column - these are the units of tens. 3, 4, and 1 should be in a column - these are the hundreds.
You may wish to use graph paper to help you keep your lines straight. Beginning learners may even draw templates of horizontal rows and vertical columns to practice lining their numbers up correctly.;
, Add these numbers, and write the sum directly below this column, below the line. In the example above, adding 3 + 1 + 2 = 6. Write the 6 below the line.


You can also choose to add these numbers individually: 3 + 1 = 4. 4 + 2 = 6.
Add the number from the next column to the left. In our example, this would be 8 + 1 + 2. Continue working in this way from right to left until all numbers are added.
It is the same sequence no matter how many columns of numbers you have. You can have as few as two columns, and as many as your page will hold.
It is also the same sequence no matter how many numbers are in your columns. Use this sequence to add any two or more large numbers.

, If the sum is more than one digit, you will need to ""carry"" the extra digit. This means that you will need to add an additional number into the next column to the left.


You easily do this by writing a small number one to the top of your next column. This is called ""showing your work.""
For example, add the sum 982 + 247 + 475, then draw a line beneath. Using the right-to-left method, add 2 + 7 + 5. The sum is 14. Write the 4 beneath the line on the right side as the sum, and write a small number 1 above the next column to the left.
When you are adding the next column, simply include the additional 1 as a part of your sum. For example, the next column would be the equation 8 + 4 + 7 (+1) = 20. Write the 0 below the line, and write the 2 above the next column to the left.
Your next column will now read: 9 + 2 + 4 (+2). Add these numbers. Because there is no additional column, you can now write your sum entire, whether it's one digit or two. In this case, the sum is 17.
Look at the sum now written below the line: 1704. This is your total.

, This process can be done either mentally or on paper, and consists of rearranging the digits you're adding for easier arithmetic.This technique works well when adding long columns of numbers.


Either mentally or with a pencil, go down the vertical column of numbers you need to add, and group them into units of 10.For instance, in the vertical column 9 + 3 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 1, you can find three units of 10 (3 + 7, 2 + 4 + 4, 9 + 1) with 7 left. Therefore, your sum of this single column will be 37.
If you have a second vertical column, write the 7 at the base of the right column, and carry the 3. Repeat this process until all columns have been added.

Convert the mixed numbers into improper fractions.,
Find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of both the denominators.,
Make the denominators the same.,
Add the two fractions.,
Convert the improper fraction back into a mixed fraction.",How to Add Mixed Numbers2," You can do this by multiplying the denominator and whole number of a mixed number, and then adding this to the numerator of the fraction of the mixed number. Your answer will be the new numerator while the denominator remains the same.


To convert 1 1/2 to a mixed number, multiply the whole number 1 by the denominator 2, and then add it to the numerator. Put your new answer over the original base.

1 * 2 = 2, and 2 + 1 = 3. Place the answer 3 over the original denominator and you have 3/2.


To convert 2 3/4 to a mixed number, multiply the whole number 2 by the denominator 4. 2 * 4 = 8.

Next, add this number to the original numerator and place it over the original denominator. 8 + 3 = 11. Put 11 over 4 to get 11/4.



, The LCM is the lowest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers. If the denominators are already the same, skip this step.


If one of the denominators is divisible by the other, the larger denominator is the LCM. The LCM of 2 and 4 is 4 because 4 is evenly divisible by 2.

, You can do this by finding equivalent fractions. Multiply the denominator by a number that will give you the LCM as the product. Multiply the numerator by the same number. Do this with both fractions.


Since the denominator of 3/2 has to be multiplied by 2 to get the new denominator of 4, you should multiply the numerator by 2 to find the equivalent fraction of 3/2. 3 * 2 = 6, so the new fraction is 6/4.
Since 11/4 already has the denominator of 4, you're in luck. You don't have to change it.

, Now that the denominators are the same, just add the numerators to get your answer while keeping the same base.


6/4 + 11/4 = 17/4.

, Since the original problem was in mixed number form, you can convert it back into a mixed number. Here's how to do it:


First, divide the numerator by the denominator. Divide 4 into 17. 4 goes into 17 4 times, so the quotient is 4. The remainder, or the number that is left over, is 1.
Make your quotient the new whole number. Take your remainder and place it over the original denominator to finish converting the improper fraction into a mixed number. The quotient is 4, the remainder is 1, and the original denominator was 4, so the final answer is 4 1/4.

Write any two or more numbers in a column, of at least 2 digits.,
Add multiple numbers by placing them in vertical columns, then writing the resulting sums vertically beneath the line.For example, to add 4357 to 3212 involves adding 4 thousand to 3 thousand (7,000), 3 hundred to 2 hundred (500), 5 tens to 1 ten (60), and 7 ones to 2 ones (9).,
Work more complex problems by repeating these steps, not changing them.,
Add three or more numbers using this method by simply repeating the process.",How to Add Large Numbers2," This method is sometimes called ""new math"" because it only gained popularity as an instructional method in the 1990s. It is also known as ""partial sums algorithm.""This method only works for numbers greater than 10.


This method relies on recognizing the ""place value"" of each digit. The organizing principle of our common method of writing numbers is based on positional numeration: that is, writing numbers in categories, or units, of tens.For example, in the figure 4357 refers to 4 thousands, 3 hundreds, 5 tens and 7 ones.
To add multiple numbers, write them in a vertical column, and draw a line beneath them. However, instead of a simple sum below the line, you will be writing your secondary, simpler math steps.

,


Beneath your line, write the sums of each place digit, starting on your left. For example, using the example above, the first number below the line will be 7,000, followed by the next sum (500), followed by 60, followed by the number 9.
Next, add these together. Because there will be only one number in each column, you can easily see that the resulting sum will be 7,569.

, Sometimes a sum from one place value will need to be added to another place value. This results in a multiple step problem, but it is not more complex. It is simply the same steps, repeated.


For example, when adding the two numbers 587 + 474, you will need to add 5 hundred to 4 hundred, writing the sum (900) below the line. Then add 8 tens to 7 tens, resulting in 15 tens, which can also be understood as 1 hundred and 5 tens. Write this below the above number (900). Finally, add 7 ones to 4 ones, resulting in 11, or 1 ten + 1 one. Write this number at the bottom of your problem.
Now, take the new figures and add them. This time you do NOT have to write all the 0's to keep your number in its proper place, because your other numbers will do that. 9 hundred to 1 hundred = 1000. 5 tens + 1 ten = 60. The 1 is left as is. Your final sum is therefore 1061.
Use a zero as a placeholder for unused mathematical units. In the example above, for instance, a zero is used to indicate the fact that between the thousand and the sixty, there are no hundreds in this number.

, For example, to add 982 + 247 + 475, you'll need to add 900 to 200 to 400 (1500). Then add 80 to 40 to 70 (190). Finally add 2 + 7 + 5 (14).


Next, break apart these numbers to their value places: 1500 = 1000 + 500. 190 + 100 + 90. 14 = 10 + 4.
Then repeat the addition, continuing to work left to right: thousands, then hundreds, then tens, then ones. In this case, your figure will be 1000 (total), then 500 + 100 (600), then 90 + 10 (100), then 4.
Repeat the addition, if necessary, until all units are resolved into their proper place value. In the example given above, the 1000 is resolved. You have two numbers in the hundreds which need to be added (600 + 100 = 700), no tens (0) and 4 ones.
The process is complete when all numbers are in their proper units. In the case above, you can see that the sum will be 1 thousand, 7 hundreds, 0 tens, and 4 ones, or 1704. This is your total.

Round (by raising) your numbers to the nearest multiple of 10 or 100.For example, the number 37 would be rounded to 40 by adding 3; the number 392 would be rounded to 400 by adding 8.,

To add two numbers together using this method, round each number individually. For example, when adding 39 and 97, round the 39 up to 40 by adding 1, and round the 97 up to 100 by adding 3. Now your math problem is 40 + 100, which is easily added to result in 140.
Find your final sum by adding together the two single digits that you've added to each number, and subtracting it from your initial sum. In the example above, you've added 1 (to 39) and 3 (to 97). Now add 1 + 3, resulting in the answer 4.
Next, subtract this second number from your first sum. In this case, you'll subtract 4 from 140. 140 - 4 = 137. This is your final sum.

, You will still round each number individually, but you may choose to round them to a larger unit.


The goal of rounding numbers is to make the addition simple. Sometimes you may wish to round more than once. For example, when adding 982 + 247 + 475, start by rounding 982 to 990 (+8), 247 to 250 (+3), and 475 to 480 (+5). Now your math problem reads: 990 + 250 + 480.
You can employ the rounding method a second time, by rounding 990 up by 10 to 1000, and 480 up by 20 to 500. Now your addition problem reads 1000 + 250 + 500. The total is 1750.
Next, add the numbers you've added to round up. Start with the first numbers you added: 8 + 3 + 5. This total is 16. Because you rounded a second time, add these numbers as well: 10 + 20. This total is 30. Finish by adding all totals together. In this case, you'll add 16 + 30 to result in the number 46.
Finish by subtracting 46 from 1750. The resulting, final sum is 1704.

, You probably use this form of adding large numbers already, perhaps without knowing it.


Notice how often prices are listed in numbers that can easily be rounded up to the nearest dollar. For example, frequently a price is listed as $9.95 which is easily rounded to $10.00. Prices are also often rounded to the nearest half-dollar, as $3.49 is commonly rounded to $3.50.
To pay for a series of items, you'll need to follow the steps of rounding up individually, then adding to see the total. For example, a grocery list of items might contain a gallon of milk for $3.98 (rounded to $4.00), a box of cereal for $4.38 (rounded to 4.50), two pounds of bananas for $1.97 (rounded to $2.00) and a loaf of bread for $3.47 (rounded to $3.50).
Added together, this total grocery bill would be rounded up to $14.00. You have added a total of 20-cents, or $.20, which should be subtracted for your total (pretax!) purchase price of $13.80.

Separate the 5 from the rest of the number.,
Set up the formula x(x+1){\displaystyle x(x+1)}.,
Multiply the two values together.,
Append 25 to the end of the product.",How to Square Numbers Ending in 51," You want to create two numbers: 5, and the number created by all the remaining digits in the number. This only applies to the 5 in the ones place, and not to other 5s that might appear elsewhere in the number.

For example, if you are squaring 65, you would create the number 6, and the number 5.

If you are squaring 115, you would create the number 11, and the number 5.  
;
, Let x{\displaystyle x} equal the number being squared, excluding the 5 digit in the ones place.Plug this number into the formula.

For example, if you are calculating 652{\displaystyle 65^{2}}, x=6{\displaystyle x=6}. Set up the formula as 6(6+1){\displaystyle 6(6+1)}, since 6 is the number you separated from the 5.

If you are calculating 1152{\displaystyle 115^{2}}, x=11{\displaystyle x=11}. Set up the formula as 11(11+1){\displaystyle 11(11+1)}, since 11 is the number you separated from the 5.


, First, find the sum in parentheses.For example: 6(6+1)=6(7)=42{\displaystyle 6(6+1)=6(7)=42}.

For example: 11(11+1)=11(12)=132{\displaystyle 11(11+1)=11(12)=132}.


, The result of any squared number ending in 5 will end in 25. Adding 25 to the end of the product you found previously gives you the result of squaring the original number.For example:6(7)=42{\displaystyle 6(7)=42}652=4225{\displaystyle 65^{2}=4225}

For example:11(12)=132{\displaystyle 11(12)=132}1152=13,225{\displaystyle 115^{2}=13,225}

Understand place values.,
Understand decimals.,
Line up the decimal points of the numbers you're adding.,
Extend numbers with zeroes if necessary to line them up.,
Bring down the decimal point.,
Add the numbers in the right column.,
Move left and repeat, carrying the 1 if you get an answer 10 or greater.,
Continue until you run out of columns.",How to Add Decimals," A normal number can have more than one digit, each one with a different place value.The number 472, for instance, has a 2 in the ""ones place,"" a 7 in the ""tens place,"" and a 4 in the ""hundreds place.""
This means that the 2 is just worth 2, but the 7 (in the tens place) is ten times as big as it looks. It actually means 70. The 4 in the hundreds place is ten times as big again, and means 400.;
, If adding digits to the left of a number gets to higher and higher place values, it makes sense that digits to the right of a number get smaller and smaller. To show that we're using place values smaller than one, we place a decimal point after the ones place. Just like digits to the left get bigger in multiples of ten, the digits after the decimal point have a place value that gets divided by 10 each time you move right.


For example, the number 1.65 has a 1 in the ones place, a 6 in the tenths place, and a 5 in the hundredths place. The 6 is one-tenth as big as it looks (0.6), and the 5 is one-hundrendth the size of a regular 5 (just 0.05).

, Whenever you add decimals, write each number on a separate line, in one vertical stack. Always line up the decimal points, so each digit in a column has the same place value.


For example, to solve 31.8 + 0.45, write 31.8 over 0.45, with the 1 over the 0 (both in the ones place) and the 8 over the 4 (both in the tenths place).

, Sometimes your numbers won't neatly line up, because they don't have the same number of digits or they don't use digits in the same place value. If this happens, add 0s to the beginning and/or end of the numbers so they have the same number of digits. This doesn't change the value of the number, since it means there's nothing in that place value.For example, you can write 31.8 + 0.45 as 31.80 + 00.45, so they line up over each other.

, Write the decimal point on the answer line, directly below the decimal points lined up in the problems you're adding.

, At this point, it's exactly like a regular addition problem. Add up the numbers in the column furthest to the right and write the answer on the answer line, directly beneath them.


For example, to solve 31.80 + 00.45, start with 0 + 5. Write the answer, 5, beneath that column. 31.80 + 00.45 = _ _ . _ 5.

, Remember, just like ordinary addition, if you get a two-digit answer, you need to ""carry the 1"" into the next column on the left.


In our example problem, the next column to add is 8 + 4. The answer is 12, which can't fit in one digit of the answer. Write the 2 in the answer line, and carry the 1 into the column to the left, writing it as a small number above the column.
31+1.80 + 00.45 = _ _ . 2 5.

, Continue just like you would for an ordinary addition problem, until all the digits have been added. Remember to include ""carried numbers"" in your addition.


Adding the next column in our example: 31+1.80 + 00.45 = _ 2 . 2 5.
Adding the final column (3 + 0) we get 32.25.

Teach the basic rule.,
Review the rule pictorially as an array.,
Review the rule conceptually as repeated addition.,
Review practice problems.",How to Teach the Multiplication of Signed Numbers1," The rule is that a positive times a positive equals a positive.This is the basic way of multiplying that students first learn. Remind students that numbers without a sign are assumed to be positive.

For example, 2×4=8{\displaystyle 2\times 4=8}.
;
, This is what students do to conceptualize multiplication when they are first learning it in elementary school. An array is an arrangement of shapes or objects in columns and rows. The rows equal the number of groups you have, the columns equal how many objects in each group.

For example, to show 2×4=8{\displaystyle 2\times 4=8}, you would show an array of 2 rows and 4 columns.

Also show the problem applying the commutative property. So, illustrate 4×2=8{\displaystyle 4\times 2=8} by drawing an array that shows 4 rows of 2 columns.

You an also use manipulatives or drawings to help students conceptualize that multiplication is a way to counted repeated, equal groups of objects. For example, you can use 8 coins and arrange them into two groups of 4 to show that 4×2=8{\displaystyle 4\times 2=8}, or arrange the 8 coins into four groups of 2 to show that 2×4=8{\displaystyle 2\times 4=8}. 

Use number stories to engage learners, such as ""Nikki has two baskets. She puts 4 apples in each basket. How many apples does she have?""


, You can use the arrays to show that when we multiply, we are simply adding groups of the same amount together. One factor tells us the number we are adding, and the other factor tells us how many times we add it.For example, 2×4=2+2+2+2=8{\displaystyle 2\times 4=2+2+2+2=8}.


, Give the student a number of multiplication problems. Even if the student has the particular fact memorized, have him or her show how the multiplication problem represents repeated addition. This will help them conceptualize multiplying with negative numbers.

Understand what it means to square a number.,
Multiply using a basic calculator.,
Use the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} key on a scientific calculator.",How to Square Numbers Ending in 52," Squaring a number means to raise it to the power of 2. To square a number, you simply multiply the number by itself., A basic calculator is a calculator that only has functions for the most basic operations, such as multiplying and dividing.This is the type of calculator you might use in elementary school. To find the square of a number using a basic calculator, type in the number, then the multiplication sign, then the number again, then the equal sign.

For example, to calculate 952{\displaystyle 95^{2}} on a basic calculator, you would type the following sequence:95{\displaystyle 95}×{\displaystyle \times }95{\displaystyle 95}={\displaystyle =}You should see a result of 9025{\displaystyle 9025}.


, Scientific calculators are calculators that contain a variety of functions needed in upper level maths. Scientific calculators contain a key labeled x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}. Hitting this key will give you the square of a number. To use it, type in the number being squared, then hit the x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} key.

For example, to calculate 752{\displaystyle 75^{2}} on a scientific calculator, you would type 75,x2{\displaystyle 75,x^{2}}. You should see a result of 5625{\displaystyle 5625}.

Choose your numbers.,
Write out the problem.,
Begin multiplying.,
Repeat with next top digit.,
Multiply with the next digit in the bottom number.,
Now add these numbers up.",How to Multiply With More Than One Digit,"


Have at least two numbers to multiply. It doesn't matter if they are one digit, two digit, or even ten digit numbers. You just need more than one number to multiply. For example: twenty-three and forty.;
,


Take your largest number and write it clearly on a sheet of paper. Take your second, smaller, number and write it directly underneath your first number, aligned to the right.
Underline the bottom number. This is to ensure a separation between the two numbers you have chosen and the solution.
(Optional) Add a multiplication symbol to the left of the problem. This is to provide clarity and help you remember what you were doing if you are looking over past problems.
Make sure your writing is neat and clear to avoid mistakes.

,


Now look at the digit furthest to the right on the bottom number. Or, in other words, the number in the smallest value place. Take that digit and multiply it by the digit furthest to the right on the top number. With the two numbers chosen in the previous example (twenty-three and forty) the two digits we will multiply are three and zero. Three multiplied by zero, or three groups of zero, results in a total of zero. Place this zero underneath the line (that you created when you underlined your bottom number) and directly under the digit three in the number twenty-three.
It is important to keep your numbers aligned at all times to avoid errors.

,


Begin again with the digit furthest to the right on your bottom number. (Three in our example).
Multiply it by the next digit in your top number. (Four in our example). This results in twelve. Write twelve next to the zero under the line. The two in twelve will go directly below the two in twenty-three, and the one in twelve will go in front of the two. This will result in the number one hundred and twenty being written below the line.
If you have a number longer than two digits as your top number, then continue to repeat this step until you have multiplied your digit in the bottom number by every digit in the top number.

,


Before you look at the next digit, write a zero directly under the zero in one hundred and twenty. The reason you do this is to move your value place over and keep your digits in line. Remember, the first digit you multiplied was in the 'ones' place in our example. This next digit is in the 'tens' place. So when we add our numbers together at the end to obtain the final result we will need to add the actual value. The zero serves as a placeholder and reminder that you are now multiplying from the 'tens' value place.
Shift your focus and look at the next digit in your bottom number. (Two in our example).
You will now repeat the steps that you did with the previous digit in the bottom number.
Per our example problem you would take the two in twenty-three and multiply it by the zero in forty, then take the two again and multiply it by the four in forty. This will result in eight hundred being written under one hundred and twenty. Remember to write the digits under the line before one another as we did with the previous digits.

,


Here is where the importance of keeping your numbers and digits in their correct columns comes into play.
According to our example, when you add the numbers up, you will be left with an answer of nine hundred and twenty.

Teach the basic rule.,
Explain the rule conceptually as repeated subtraction.,
Review real-world practice problems.",How to Teach the Multiplication of Signed Numbers2," The rule is that multiplying two numbers with opposite signs equals a negative. It does not matter which way the signs are presented. A negative times a positive is a negative, and a positive times a negative is a negative.For example, −2×4=−8{\displaystyle -2\times 4=-8} and 2×−4=−8{\displaystyle 2\times -4=-8}.


, The negative number can show what number to subtract, and the positive number shows how many times to subtract the number.For example, −2×4=−2−2−2−2=−8{\displaystyle -2\times 4=-2-2-2-2=-8}.

Also, 2×−4=−4−4=−8{\displaystyle 2\times -4=-4-4=-8}.

To help students visualize this concept, you can use a number line. Begin at zero, and repeatedly subtract 2 four times.


, Practice problems involving multiplying a negative and a positive often involve adding debt. You can also use any scenario in which something is removed repeatedly.

For example, “Rob takes out a $5,407 loan each college semester. He attends college for 7 semesters. If he starts with 0 dollars, how many more dollars does Rob have after college?”

In this case you would multiply −5,407×7=−37,849{\displaystyle -5,407\times 7=-37,849}. This means that Rob loses $5,407 seven times, so he has -$37,849 more dollars after college. In other words, he has a debt of -$37,849.



Another example: “There are two cafes on Main Street, Steam Queens and Bean Kings. Bean Kings averages 150 customers a day. When they stop using fair trade coffee, they begin to lose 10 customers every day. How many more customers do they have after one week?

In this case, you would multiply −10×7=−70{\displaystyle -10\times 7=-70}. This means that after one week, Bean Kings has -70 more customers, which, in practical terms, means they have 70 fewer customers after one week.

Teach the basic rule.,
Explain the rule conceptually as repeated subtraction.,
Review real-world practice problems.",How to Teach the Multiplication of Signed Numbers3," The rule is that a negative times a negative equals a positive.Point out to students that, while numbers with opposite signs will have negative products, numbers with the same signs will have positive products, whether the two numbers are positive or negative.

For example, −2×−4=8{\displaystyle -2\times -4=8}.


, This is similar to the way students use repeated subtraction to multiply a negative and a positive number. This time, however, since neither factor is positive, the students will need to subtract a negative number.If necessary, review the rules of  adding negative numbers, which state that subtracting a negative is the same as adding it. You can use a number line to show the student that if you start at a negative number and take a negative amount away from it, you are moving towards the right on the number line. Remind the student that moving to the right on a number line means adding.

When students are using repeated subtraction to multiply a negative by a negative, they can think of either number as the negative number being subtracted, and the other number being the number of times the negative number is subtracted.

For example, −2×−4=−(−2)−(−2)−(−2)−(−2)=8{\displaystyle -2\times -4=-(-2)-(-2)-(-2)-(-2)=8}.

Also, −2×−4=−(−4)−(−4)=8{\displaystyle -2\times -4=-(-4)-(-4)=8}.


, These often involve scenarios in which someone is having someone else pay off a debt; that is, when someone is subtracting debt.

For example, “After college, Rob has -37,849 dollars to his name. His mom agrees to pay 4 of his student loan bills, which are 383 dollars each month, until he finds his feet. How much more money does Rob have after those 4 months?”

In this example, you would multiply −383×−4=1,532{\displaystyle -383\times -4=1,532}. This means that Rob has a negative amount of money (a debt), taken away four times. This leaves him with $1,532 more than he had at the start of the 4 months.

Understand why the method works.The Russian peasant method works because it converts the problem into binary (base 2) multiplication, rather than base 10 (which standard multiplication uses).,
Know when the Russian peasant method of multiplication is useful.",How to Multiply Using the Russian Peasant Method," Choose two numbers that you want to multiply, whether to solve a particular problem or just to try out the Russian peasant method of multiplication.


For example, try multiplying 146 x 37.;
, Using a piece of paper and pen, divide the piece of paper into two columns by drawing a line down the middle of the paper. Write one of the numbers you want to multiply at the top the each column.In this example, write “146” at the top of the left column, and “37” at the top of the right column.

, Ignore any remainder each time you halve the number. Write each halved number down in the left column, in order. In this example:


Start by halving 146 (146 ÷ 2 = 73). Write “73” in the left column below “146.”
Next, halve 73 (73 ÷ 2 = 36 with a remainder of 1). Write “36” in the left column below “73,” ignoring the remainder.
Next, halve 36 (36 ÷ 2 = 18). Write “18” in the left column below “36.”
Next, halve 18 (18 ÷ 2 = 9). Write “9” in the left column below “18.”
Next, halve 9 (9 ÷ 2 = 4 with a remainder of 1). Write “4” in the left column below “18,” ignoring the remainder.
Next, halve 4 (4 ÷ 2 = 2). Write “2” in the left column below “4.”
Finally, halve 2 (2÷ 2 = 1). Write “1” in the left column below “2.”

, In this example:


Each column should have 8 numbers in it. This is because it took seven steps of dividing the original number in the right column to reach 1.
In the right column, start by doubling 37 (37 x 2 = 74). Write “74” in the right column below “37.”
Next, double 74 (74 x 2 = 148). Write “148” in the right column below “74.”
Next, double 148 (148 x 2 = 296). Write “296” in the right column below “148.”
Next, double 296 (296 x 2 = 592). Write “592” in the right column below “296.”
Next, double 592 (592 x 2 = 1184). Write “1184” in the right column below “592.”
Next, double 1184 (1184 x 2 = 2368). Write “2368” in the right column below “1184.”
Finally, double 2368 (2368 x 2 = 4736). Write “4736” in the right column below “2368.”

, In this example:


There are 8 rows. You will strike through 5 of them.
Strike through the rows beginning with 146, 36, 18, 4, and 2 in the left column, since these are even numbers. Working left to right, this means striking through the first row (146, 37), the third row (36, 148), the fourth row (18, 296), the sixth row (4, 1184), and the seventh row (2, 2368).
Please note that you should strike through even numbers, even if they begin with an odd numeral. For example, you should strike through the row beginning with 146 since it is an even number, even though 146 begins with an odd numeral, 1. Likewise, you should strike though 36, since it is an even number, even though 36 begins with an odd numeral, 3.
If you prefer, you can just strike through the numbers in the right side that fall into the rows that begin with an even number on the left side (as in the picture above). In this example, this means striking through the numbers on the right hand side of the first, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh rows: 37, 148, 296, 1184, and 2368.

, The sum of these numbers is equal to the product you would get from multiplying the original numbers using the standard method. In this example:


The remaining numbers in the right column are 74, 592, 4736.
Add these numbers to get the sum of 5402 (74 + 592 + 4736 = 5402).
This number is the product of multiplying the original numbers in this example, 146 and 37 (146 x 37 = 5402).

, You can use the standard method of multiplying by hand in order to make sure that you got the right answer using the Russian peasant method of multiplication. Using the previous example (146 x 37):


Write “146,” and then “37” below it so that the numbers line up flush on the right side.
Draw a line below these numbers to create a work area. You will do your calculations below this line.
Multiply 7 x 6 (= 42). Write “2” down in the work area and carry the “4.”
Multiply 7 x 4 (= 28). Add the carried “4” to this sum to get a new sum, 32 (4 + 28 = 32). Write down “2” in the work area to the left of “2” you wrote down in your work area, and carry the “3.”
Multiply 7 x 1 (= 7). Add the carried “3” to this sum to get a new sum, 10 (7 + 3 = 10). Write down “10” in your work area, to the left of the “22” that is already there.
You should now have the number “1022” written down in your work area.
Start working on a new row in your work area, directly below “1022.”
Write “0” on the right of this new row, directly below the rightmost “2” of “1022.”
Multiply 3 x 6 (= 18). Write “8” to the left of the “0,” and carry the “1.”
Multiply 3 x 4 (= 12). Add the carried “1” to this sum to get a new sum, 13 (12 + 1 = 13). Write down “3” in your work area to the left of the “8,” and carry the “1.”
Multiply 3 x 1 (= 3). Add the carried “1” to this sum to get a new sum, 4 (3 + 1 = 4).
You should now have the number “4380” written in the second row of your work area.
Add the two rows in your work area (1022 + 4380). You should get the sum 5402 (1022 + 4380 = 5402).
This sum, which is the same number derived by the Russian peasant method, verifies that the method produced the correct answer.

, You can also use an electronic calculator in order to make sure that you got the right answer using the Russian peasant method of multiplication. Using the previous example (146 x 37):


Enter 146 in the calculator by pressing the corresponding digits, 1, 4, 6.
Press the multiplication (“x”) key.
Enter 37 in the calculator by pressing the corresponding digits, 3, 7.
Press the equals (“=”) key.
The display should show “5402,” which is the same number derived by the Russian peasant method, verifying that the method produced the correct answer.

, If you check your answer and it is not correct, start looking for where you might have made a mistake, and try multiplying the numbers again using the Russian peasant method.


First, try checking your work again using the standard multiplication method or a calculator, just to be sure.
Then, work through the problem again using the Russian peasant method.
This time, double-check to make sure you are halving and doubling the numbers correctly.
In addition, make sure you correctly add the numbers that remain in the right-hand column after you cross out the other numbers.
Check all of your work twice to make sure that you get the correct answer.

, If you can’t seem to get the right answer, or if you aren’t sure how to check your work, ask some for help (such as a friend, sibling, parent, or teacher). Ask this person to try the problem out, too, and then you compare answers. The person might also be able to explain how to use the Russian peasant method.

, It does this by halving and doubling the numbers you are trying to multiply (since halving and doubling convert all numbers into multiples of 2, or into factors of numbers that are divisible by 2).

, You might be asked to try the Russian peasant method of multiplication for a school assignment, or just try it out for fun. However, the method has advantages that might make it turn out to be a handy way to multiply in other situations.


You don’t need to know or memorize multiplication tables in order to multiply using the Russian peasant method (like you do in order to use standard long multiplication). As long as you can double and halve, you can multiply any two numbers using the Russian peasant method.
You can use bits of material in order to multiply using the Russian peasant method. This can be useful when you need to multiply and you don’t have a calculator or a pencil and paper handy. For example, you could multiply the example above (146 x 37) by using lots of beans or other material. Each time you need to halve or double a number in the process, just add or take away the respective number of beans.
The Russian peasant method does normally take longer than standard long multiplication, however.
In addition, the Russian peasant method of multiplication can become very unwieldy if you are trying to multiply large numbers, since this will involve many multiples of 2 or numbers that are factors of numbers divisible by 2, and potentially very large ones.

Make more marks to the right of 0 and label them 1, 2, 3, and so on in that order. Those are the positive numbers. Negative numbers go the opposite direction. Starting at 0 and moving left, draw more marks and label them -1, -2, -3, and so on.;
, Let's say you want to solve the problem -8 + 3. Find the first number, -8, on the number line. Draw a thick dot at that number.

, On the number line, adding a positive number moves you to the right. For example, if you start at -8 and add 3, you move 3 marks to the right. The answer is where you end up: -5. This works no matter which number we start with.

, Subtracting a positive number moves you to the left of the number line. For example, you know that -8 - 3 = -11, because -11 is three marks left of -8.

, Now let's try the other way around. This time, start at +5 on the number line and solve the problem 5 + (-2). Because the second number is negative, we change the direction we move on the number line. Adding normally moves to the right, but adding a negative number moves to the left instead. Start at +5, move 2 spaces to the left, and you end up at +3. So 5 + (-2) = 3.


Here's another way to think of it: adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number. 5 + (-2) = 5 - 2.

, Now try subtracting a negative number: 5 - (-2). Again, we're going to switch the normal direction, and move right instead of left. Start at +5, move two the right, and you end up at 7.


Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. 5 - (-2) = 5 + 2.

, Let's solve -6 + (-4). Start at -6 on the number line. Addition moves to the right, but the negative sign in front of the 4 changes our direction, so we move to the left instead. Move four spaces left of -6 and you'll land on -10, so -6 + (-4) = -10.


Don't get confused by where you start on the number line. The first number only tells you where to begin on the number line. You'll always move right or left based on the type of problem and the second number.

, Now let's solve -10 - (-3). Start at -10. Subtraction moves to the left but the negative in front of the 3 changes direction to the right instead. Move 3 places to the right and land on -3. The solution is -10 - (-3) = -7.


Here's a memory aid: it takes two lines to draw the two negative signs. It also takes two lines to draw a plus sign, so - - is the same as +, moving to the right.

Learn about absolute value.,
Add two negative numbers.,
Add a positive and a negative number.,
Subtract a negative number.,
Solve problems with more than two numbers.",How to Add and Subtract Negatives2," For other problems, it's helpful to understand absolute value. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. The easiest way to find this is just to ignore the negative sign in front of it. Here are some examples:


The absolute value of 6 is 6.
The absolute value of -6 is also 6.
9 has a greater absolute value than 7.
-8 has a greater absolute value than 5. It doesn't matter that one is negative.

, Adding negative numbers together is just like adding positive numbers together, except that the answer has a ""negative"" sign in front of it. For instance, (-2) + (-4) = -6.

, For a problem like 2 + (-4), you might not know whether the answer will be positive or negative. If the number line doesn't help you figure it out, here's another way to solve it:


Rearrange it so you're subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one. Ignore the negative sign for now. For our example, write 4 - 2 instead.
Solve that problem: 4 - 2 = 2. This isn't the answer yet!
Look at the original problem and check the sign (+ or -) of the number with the largest absolute value number. 4 has a higher value than 2, so we look at that in the problem 2 + (-4). There's a negative sign in front of the 4, so our final answer will also have a negative sign. The answer is -2.

, Subtracting the negative is the same as adding a positive. For instance, 4 - (-6) = 4 + 6. This gets a little harder when you start with a negative number as well. Once it's an addition problem, you can switch the order of the two numbers and turn it into an ordinary subtraction problem. Here are a few examples:


3 - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4
(-2) - (-5) = (-2) + 5 = 5 - 2 = 3
(-4) - (-3) = (-4) + 3 = 3 - 4 = -1

, If you have a long chain of numbers, just use these steps to solve them two at a time. Here's an example:



(-7) - (-3) - 2 + 1
=(-7) + 3 - 2 + 1
=3 - 7 - 2 + 1
=(-4) - 2 + 1
=-6 + 1

=-5

For example, if you are multiplying 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you would determine that the first number, 34, has a 4 in the ones place, and a 3 in the tens place.
;
, The number of lines you draw will correspond to the digit in the tens place.

Draw the lines at about a 45 degree angle, slanting down towards the right.

For example, if you are representing 34, you would draw 3 parallel lines.


, The number of lines will correspond to the digit in the ones place. Draw these lines above and to the right of the tens lines.

Leave some space between the ones lines and the tens lines, so you can tell them apart.

For example, if you are representing 34, you will draw 4 parallel lines.


, You need to know how many places are in your number, and what digit is in each place.

For example, if your second number is 12, you would determine that you have a 2 in the ones place, and a 1 in the tens place.


, The number of lines will correspond to the digit in the tens place. Draw the lines near the top of the diagram. They should cross all the lines of the first number, slanting in the opposite direction.

It might be helpful to draw each number’s lines in a different color.

For example, if you are representing the number 12, you would draw 1 parallel line crossing over the sets of lines from the first number.


, The number of lines will correspond to the digit in the ones place. Draw the lines below the ones lines, so that they cross over all the lines of the first number, slanting in the opposite direction.

Leave some space between the ones lines and the tens lines, so you can tell them apart.

For example, if you are representing 12, you will draw 2 parallel lines below the 1 line you drew for the tens place.


, In the line multiplication method, you will be adding up these lines instead of doing any actual multiplying.
, These are the dots formed at the intersection where the ones lines for each number intersect.

Think, “A one times a one equals a one.”

For example, for 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you would circle the dots formed where the 4 lines intersect with the 2 lines, which are in the set on the right side of the diagram.


, These are the dots formed when the ones digit of either number intersects with the tens digit of the other number.

Think, “A one times a ten equals a ten.”

For example, for 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you would circle the dots formed where the 1 line intersects with the 4 lines, and where the 2 lines intersect with the 3 lines, which are in the middle of the diagram.


, These are the dots formed at the intersection where the tens lines for each number intersect.

Think, “A ten times a ten equals a hundred.”

For example, for 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you would circle the dots formed where the 3 lines intersect with the 1 line, which is on the left side of the diagram.


, These are the dots you circled on the right side of the diagram. This number will be in the ones place of your answer.

For 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you should count 8 dots. So 8{\displaystyle 8} will be the digit in the ones place of your final answer.


, These are the two sets of dots in the middle of the diagram. This number will be in the tens place of your answer.

For 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you should count 10 dots.

Just like any time you add or multiply, once a digit in any place value reaches 10, you need to carry.So, if you count 10 for the tens place, you would place a 0{\displaystyle 0} in the tens place, and carry the 1 over to the hundreds place.


, These are the dots you circled on the left side of the diagram. This number will be hundreds place of your answer.

For 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you should count 3 dots. 

Don’t forget to add any amount you carried over. For 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you carried over a 1 from the tens place, so calculate 3+1=4{\displaystyle 3+1=4}. So 4{\displaystyle 4} will be the digit in the hundreds place of your final answer.


, Put together all the digits you found for each place value.

For example, for 34×12{\displaystyle 34\times 12}, you determine an 8{\displaystyle 8} goes in the ones place, a 0{\displaystyle 0} goes in the tens place, and a 4{\displaystyle 4} goes in the hundreds place. So your final answer is 408{\displaystyle 408}.

For example, if you are multiplying 18×16{\displaystyle 18\times 16}, you would write or think of the numbers with the ones digits lined up vertically (the 8 and the 6), and the tens digits lined up vertically (the two 1s). It doesn’t matter which number is on top.
;
, You might visualize this as a shape that looks like the African continent. The only digit that should not be inside the circle is the bottom tens digits.For example, if you are multiplying 18×16{\displaystyle 18\times 16}, you would draw a circle encompassing 18 and 6.


, You should be adding the top number and the bottom ones digit. Make sure you add rather than multiply.

For example, 18+6=24{\displaystyle 18+6=24}.


, You can do this easily by adding a 0 to the end of the number. Set this number aside, as it is your first partial product.

For example, 24×10=240{\displaystyle 24\times 10=240}.


, Make sure you multiply this time, instead of adding. This is the second partial product.

For example, 8×6=48{\displaystyle 8\times 6=48}.


, This will give you the product of your two original factors.For example, 240+48=288{\displaystyle 240+48=288}. Thus, 18×16=288{\displaystyle 18\times 16=288}.

Find the difference between the squares of a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.",How to Multiply up to 20X20 Quickly2," This method only works if you get an even number when you subtract the smaller factor from the larger factor.

For example, if you are calculating 12×18{\displaystyle 12\times 18}, you can use this method, since 18−12=6{\displaystyle 18-12=6}, and 6 is an even number.

Before you go any further, keep in mind that this method works best if you have the squares to 20 memorized. (That is, you know what 122{\displaystyle 12^{2}} is, what 132{\displaystyle 13^{2}} is, 142{\displaystyle 14^{2}} is, etc.)


, The formula is a2−b2=(a+b)(a−b){\displaystyle a^{2}-b^{2}=(a+b)(a-b)}., Plug this value into the formula for the variable b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, the difference between 18 and 12 is 6. 62=3{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{2}}=3}. So, your formula should look like this: a2−32=(a+3)(a−3){\displaystyle a^{2}-3^{2}=(a+3)(a-3)}.


, To do this, add the factors together, and divide their sum by 2. Plug this value into the formula for the variable a{\displaystyle a}.

For example, 18+12=30{\displaystyle 18+12=30}. The average of 30 is 15. So, your formula should look like this: 152−32=(15+3)(15−3){\displaystyle 15^{2}-3^{2}=(15+3)(15-3)}.


, Remember that squaring a number means multiplying it by itself. This step is easy if you have your squares to 20 memorized.

For example, 152=225{\displaystyle 15^{2}=225} and 32=9{\displaystyle 3^{2}=9}. So, your formula is now 225−9=(15+3)(15−3){\displaystyle 225-9=(15+3)(15-3)}.


, The result is the product of your two original factors.For example, 225−9=216{\displaystyle 225-9=216}. So, 12×18=216{\displaystyle 12\times 18=216}.

Multiply the other factor by 2.,
Halve the 20 and double the other factor.,
Multiply the other factor by 10.",How to Multiply up to 20X20 Quickly3," Then, add 0 to the end of the product. The result is 20 times the other product.For example, to calculate 20×17{\displaystyle 20\times 17}, you would calculate 17×2=34{\displaystyle 17\times 2=34}. Then, adding a 0 to the end of the product (34), you have 17×20=340{\displaystyle 17\times 20=340}.


, Halving 20 means dividing it by 2, which gives you 10. To double the other factor, multiply it by 2. The product of these two new factors gives you the product of the original two factors.For example, if you are calculating 20×12{\displaystyle 20\times 12}, you would halve the 20 to 10, and multiply 12 by 2: 12×2=24{\displaystyle 12\times 2=24}. So, the new multiplication is 10×24=240{\displaystyle 10\times 24=240}. So, 20×12=240{\displaystyle 20\times 12=240}


, Then, double the product by multiplying it by 2. This gives you the product of the other factor and 20.

For example, to calculate 20×18{\displaystyle 20\times 18}, you would first calculate 18×10=180{\displaystyle 18\times 10=180}. Then, calculate 180×2=360{\displaystyle 180\times 2=360}. So, 20×18=360{\displaystyle 20\times 18=360}.

Come up with your answer.",How to Add and Subtract Fractions1," If the denominator of the two fractions that you are adding or subtracting is the same, put the same number once as the denominator for your answer.


In other words, 1/5 and 2/5 does not need to be written as 1/5 + 2/5 = ? It can be written as 1+2/5 = ?. The denominator is the same, so it can be written only once. Both numerators then go on top.;
, The ""numerator"" is the top number of any fraction. If we take the above example, 1/5 and 2/5, 1 and 2 are our numerators.


Whether you have it written 1/5 + 2/5 or 1+2/5, you answer should be the same: 3! After all, 1 + 2 = 3.

, Since you're working with one constant denominator, don't do anything with it! Don't add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Just leave it be.


So, using the same example, our denominator is 5. That's it! That's the bottom number of our fraction. That's half the answer already!

, Now, all you do is write out your numerator and your denominator! If you've followed the above example, you'll find that the answer to this problem is 3/5.


What was your numerator? 3. The denominator? 5. Therefore, 1/5 + 2/5, or 1+2/5, equals 3/5.

For example, 38{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{8}}} and 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} are not like fractions, because they have different denominators.

The fractions 38{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{8}}} and 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} are like fractions, because they have the same denominator (8).
;
,

For example, if you are adding 38{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{8}}} and 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}}, you would first calculate 3+1=4{\displaystyle 3+1=4}.


, Do NOT add the denominators.For example, 38+18=48{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{8}}+{\frac {1}{8}}={\frac {4}{8}}}.


, For school work, your instructor will most likely want you to simplify, or reduce your fraction. To do this, you need to find the largest number that will divide evenly into the numerator and denominator.Divide the numerator and denominator by this number to find the simplified fraction. For more information on how to do this, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, 4 and 8 can both be divided by 4:4÷4=1{\displaystyle 4\div 4=1}8÷4=2{\displaystyle 8\div 4=2}So, 48{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{8}}}simplifies to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.

Keep the numerators (top numbers) level with each other on top, and the denominators (bottom numbers) on the line beneath them. Let's use the fractions 9 / 11 and 2 / 4 as our example.;
, If you multiply the numerator and denominator in a fraction by the same number, you end up with an equivalent fraction, exactly equal to the first. For example, if you take 2 / 4, and multiply each number by 2, you get 4 / 8, which is an equal (""equivalent"") fraction to 2/4. You can test this yourself by drawing the fractions:


Draw a circle, divide it into four equally sized pieces, then color in two of them (2 / 4).
Draw a new circle, divide it into 8 equal pieces, then color in four of them (4 / 8).
Compare the colored areas in the two circles, representing 2/4 and 4/8. These two areas have an equal size.

, Before we can add or subtract the fractions, we need to write them so they have the same denominator (a ""common denominator"") that is divisible by both numbers. The quickest way to find this is to multiply the two denominators together. Once you've written the answer down, you can skip ahead to the section on finishing the problem, or try the step below to find a different common denominator that may be easier to use.


For example, we started with the fractions 9 / 11 and 2 / 4. 11 and 4 are the denominators.
Multiply the two denominators together: 11 x 4 = 44.

, The method above is quick, but you can instead find the ""least common denominator,"" meaning the smallest possible answer. To do this, write down the multiples for each of the original denominators. Circle the smallest number that appears on both lists. Here's a new example, which we could use if we were solving ""5/6 + 2/9"":


The denominators are 6 and 9, so we want to ""count by sixes"" and ""count by nines"" to find the multiples:
Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24
Multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36
Since 18 is in both tables, it can be used as a common denominator.

, In our first example, using 9/11 and 2/4, we decided to use 44 as the common denominator. But remember, we can't just change the denominator without multiplying the numerator by the same amount as well. Here's how we turn it into an equivalent fraction:


We know 11 x 4 = 44 (this is how we found the number 44 to begin with, but you can solve 44 ÷ 11 if you forgot).
Multiply both sides of the fraction by the same number to get the result:
(9 x 4 ) / (11 x 4) = 36/44


, Here's the second fraction in our example, 2 / 4, transformed into an equivalent fraction using 44 as the denominator:


4 x 11 = 44
(2 x 11) / (4 x 11) = 22/44.

, Once both fractions use the same denominator, you can add or subtract the numerators to get the answer:


Addition: 36 / 44 + 22 / 44 = (36 + 22) / 44 = 58/44

Or subtraction: 36 / 44 - 22/44 = (36 - 22) / 44 = 14 / 44


, If the numerator ends up larger than the denominator, you have a fraction larger than 1 (an ""improper fraction). You can make these into a mixed number, which is easier to read, by dividing the numerator by the denominator, and keeping the remainder as a fraction. For example, using the fraction 58 / 44, we get 58 ÷ 44 = 1, with remainder 14 left over. This means our final mixed number is 1 and 14/44.


If you're not sure how to divide the numbers, you can keep subtracting the bottom number from the top, writing down how many times you've subtracted. For example, convert 317 / 100 like this:
317 - 100 = 217 (subtracted 1 time). 217 - 100 = 117 (subtracted 2 times). 117 - 100 = 17 (3 times). We can't subtract any more, so the answer is 3 and 17/100.

, Simplifying a fraction means writing it in its smallest equivalent form, to make it easier to use. Do this by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number. If you can find a way to simplify the answer even further, keep doing it until you can't find another. For example, to simplify 14/44:


The numbers 14 and 44 are both divisible by 2, so let's use that.
(14 ÷ 2 ) / (44 ÷ 2) = 7 / 22

There are no numbers that divide evenly into both 7 and 22, so this is our final, simplified answer.

Write out your answer.",How to Add a Sequence of Consecutive Odd Numbers," Before you get started, you need to determine what the last consecutive number in your set will be. This formula can help you add any number of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1.If you're working on an assignment, this number will be given to you. For example, if the question asks you to find the sum of all consecutive odd numbers between 1 and 81, your ending point is 81.;
, The next step is to simply add 1 to your ending point. You should now have an even number, which is essential for the next step.


For example, if your ending point is 81, 81 + 1 = 82.

, Once you have an even number, you should divide this by 2. This will give you an odd number that is equal to the number of digits that are being added together.


For example, 82 / 2 = 41.

, The last step is to square the number, or multiply it by itself. Once you do this, you will have your answer.


For example, 41 x 41 = 1681. This means the sum of all consecutive odd numbers between 1 and 81 is 1681.

, The key to understanding this formula is to recognize the underlying pattern. The sum of any set of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1 is always equal to the square of the number of digits that were added together.


Sum of first odd number = 1
Sum of first two odd numbers = 1 + 3 = 4 (= 2 x 2).
Sum of first three odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (= 3 x 3).
Sum of first four odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 (= 4 x 4).

, By solving this problem, you learned more than the sum of the numbers. You also learned how many consecutive digits were added together: 41! This is because the number of digits added together is always equal to the square root of the sum.


Sum of first odd number = 1. The square root of 1 is 1, and only one digit was added.
Sum of first two odd numbers = 1 + 3 = 4. The square root of 4 is 2, and two digits were added.
Sum of first three odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. The square root of 9 is 3, and three digits were added.
Sum of first four odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. The square root of 16 is 4, and four digits were added.

, Once you understand the formula and how it works, you can write it down in a format that will be applicable no matter what numbers you are dealing with. The formula to find the sum of the first n odd numbers is n x n or n squared.


For example, if you plugged 41 in for n, you would have 41 x 41, or 1681, which is equal to the sum of the first 41 odd numbers.
If you don't know how many numbers you are dealing with, the formula to determine the sum between 1 and n is (1/2(n + 1))2


, If you are given a series of consecutive odd numbers and are asked to find their sum, you should use the (1/2(n + 1))2 equation. If, on the other hand, you have been given a sum and asked to find the series of consecutive odd numbers that adds up to that sum, you will need to use a different formula all together.

, To find out what consecutive odd numbers add up to a given sum, you will have to create an algebraic formula. Start by using n to represent the first number in the sequence.,


This means the second number in the series will be n + 2, the third will be n + 4, etc.

, Once you know how to represent each number in the series, it is time to write out your formula. The left side of your formula should represent the numbers in the series, and the right side should represent their sum.


For example, if you have been asked to find a series of two consecutive odd numbers that add up to 128, you would write n + n + 2 = 128.

, If you have more than one n on the left side of your equation, add them together. This will make it much easier to solve.


For example, n + n + 2 = 128 simplifies to 2n + 2 = 128.

, Remember that whatever changes you make to one side of the equation, you must make to the other side as well.


Deal with addition and subtraction first. In this case, you need to subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get n by itself , so 2n = 126.
Then deal with multiplication and division. In this case, you need to divide both sides by 2 in order to isolate n, so n = 113.

, At this point, you know that n = 113, but you are not quite done. You need to make sure that you completely answer the question that was asked. If the question asks you what series of consecutive numbers adds up to a given sum, you must write out all of the numbers.


The answer to this problem is 113 and 115 because n = 113 and n + 2 = 115.
It's always a good idea to check your work by plugging your numbers back into the equation. If they don't equal the given sum, go back and try again.

Find the lowest common denominator.,
Multiply the denominator by the number needed to get the LCD.,
Multiple the numerator by that number, too.,
Add (or subtract) the numerators to get your answer.",How to Add and Subtract Fractions2," This means the lowest number both denominators have in common. Let's take the fractions 2/3 and 3/4. What are the denominators? 3 and 4. To find the lowest common denominator of the two, you can do this one of three ways:



Write out the multiples. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18...and so on. The multiples of 4? 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc. What's the lowest number seen in both of the sets? 12! That's your lowest common denominator, or LCD.

Prime factorization. If you know what factors are, you can do prime factorization. That's finding out what numbers can make your denominators. For 3, the factors are 3 and 1. For 4, the factors are 2 and 2. Then, you multiply them together. 3 x 2 x 2 = 12. Your LCD!


Multiply the numbers together for small numbers. In some cases, like this one, you could just multiply the numbers together – 3 x 4 = 12. However, if your denominators are big, don't do this! You don't want to multiply 56 x 44 and have to work with 2,464 as your answer!



, In other words, you want each of your denominators to be the same number – the LCD. In our example, we want our denominator to be 12. To turn 3 into 12, you need 3 x 4. To turn 4 into twelve, you need 4 x 3. The resulting like denominator will be the denominator for your final answer.


So our 2/3 turns into 2/3 x 4 and 3/4 turns into 3/4 x 3. That means we now have 2/12 and 3/12. But we're not done yet!

You'll notice that the denominators, in this instance, are multiplied by each other. This works in this situation, but not all situations. Sometimes, instead of multiplying the two denominators together, you can multiply both denominators by different numbers to get one small number.
And then in other cases, sometimes you only have to multiply one denominator to make it equal to the denominator of the other fraction in the equation.



, When you multiply the denominator by a certain number, you also have to multiply the numerator by the same number. What we did in the last step was just half of the multiplication necessary.


We had 2/3x4 and 3/4x3 as our first step – to add the second step, it's really 2 x 4/3 x 4 and 3 x 3/4 x 3. That means our new numbers are 8/12 and 9/12. Perfect!

, To add 8/12 + 9/12, all you have to do is add the numerators. Remember: you leave the denominator alone now. The number you got with the LCD is your final denominator.


For this example, (8+9)/12 = 17/12. To turn this into a mixed fraction, simply subtract the denominator from the numerator and see what's left over. In this case, 17/12 = 1 5/12

"
"
Convert your mixed fractions into improper fractions.,
Find the common denominator.,
Multiply your numerators and denominators to get your like fraction.,
Add or subtract your fractions.,
Convert your answer back into a mixed fraction.",How to Add and Subtract Fractions3," A mixed fraction is when you have a whole number and a fraction, like in the above example (1 5/12). Meanwhile, an improper fraction is one where the numerator (the top number) is bigger than the denominator (the bottom number). That's also seen in the above step, with 17/12.


For the example for this section, let's work with 13/12 and 17/8.

, Remember the three ways you can find the LCD? By either writing out the multiples, using prime factorization, or by multiplying the denominators.


Let's figure out the multiples of our example, 12 and 8. What's the smallest number these two go into? 24. 8, 16, 24 and 12, 24 – bingo!

, Both denominators now need to be turned into 24. How do you get 12 to 24? Multiply it by 2. 8 to 24? Multiply it by three. But don't forget – you need to multiply the numerators, too!


So 13 x 2/12 x 2 = 26/24. And 17 x 3/8 x 3 = 51/24. We're well on our way to solving the problem!

, Now that you have the same denominator, you can add these two numbers together with ease. Remember, leave the denominator alone!


26/24 + 51/24 = 77/24. There's your one fraction! That top number is mighty big, though....

, Having such a large number on top is a little weird – you can't quite tell the size of your fraction. All you have to do is put the denominator into the numerator until in can't be repeated again and then see what you have leftover.


For this example, 24 goes into 77 three times. That is, 24 x 3 = 72. But there's 5 leftover! So what's your final answer? 3 5/24. That's it!

Write the numbers with the decimals aligned vertically.,
Make the numbers the same length.,
Add according to the standard algorithm.,
Drop the decimal into your sum.",How to Add and Multiply Decimals1," The numbers should be stacked on top of each other. This ensures that the place values are lined up, so that you add your digits correctly. The numbers will not necessarily be right-aligned at this point, as they usually are when adding numbers.

For example, you might need to add the numbers 15.525 and 7.92. If you align your decimal points, the 2s in the hundredths place of both numbers should be aligned vertically, as should the digits in the tenths and ones place. 
;
, This means the numbers should have the same number of digits. Add zeros to the end of the numbers to make them right-aligned.Make sure that the place values of each number line up.

For example, you should add a 0 to the thousandths place of 7.92, changing the number to 7.920. The two numbers should now be right-aligned.


, Begin with the place value farthest to the right.Add the digits together, carrying into the next place value if necessary. Ignore the decimal point for now, and add the digits as normal.

For example, adding, 15525 and 7920, you should end up with 23445.


, The decimal point in your answer should be aligned with the decimal points in your two addends. For example, 15.525+7.92=23.445{\displaystyle 15.525+7.92=23.445}.

Make sure your fractions have the same denominator.,
Subtract the numerators of the fractions.The process for subtracting fractions is similar to the adding process.,
Place the difference of the numerators over the original denominator.,
Reduce the fraction if possible.",How to Add and Subtract Like Fractions2," As with adding, this method only works if you have like fractions. Like fractions are fractions that have the same denominator, which is the number below the fraction bar. To learn how to subtract fractions with unlike denominators, you can read Add and Subtract Fractions With Unlike Denominators.

For example, 810{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}} and 89{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{9}}} are not like fractions, because they have different denominators.

The fractions 810{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}} and 310{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{10}}} are like fractions, because they have the same denominator (10).


, Your focus will be on the numerators. The numerators are the numbers above the fraction bar.

For example, if you are subtracting 310{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{10}}} from 810{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}}, you would first calculate 8−3=5{\displaystyle 8-3=5}.


, Do NOT subtract the denominators.For example, 810−310=510{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{10}}-{\frac {3}{10}}={\frac {5}{10}}}.


, This should be your final step when working with fractions, whether you are adding or subtracting. In school your final answer usually needs to be simplified, or reduced. To do this, find the largest number that evenly divides into the numerator and denominator.Divide the numerator and denominator by this number to find the simplified fraction. For more information on how to do this, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, 5 and 10 can both be divided by 5:5÷5=1{\displaystyle 5\div 5=1}10÷5=2{\displaystyle 10\div 5=2}So, 510{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{10}}}reduces to 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.

Since the pizza is cut into 8 pieces, 8 will be the denominator for both fractions.

Since Joellen ate 2 slices, 28{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}} represents the amount of pizza that she ate.

Since Christine ate 3 slices, 38{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{8}}} represents the amount of pizza that she ate.

Together, Joellen and Christine at 28+38{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}+{\frac {3}{8}}} of the pizza.

Adding the numerators, you get 2+3=5{\displaystyle 2+3=5}.

Placing the sum of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 28+38=58{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}+{\frac {3}{8}}={\frac {5}{8}}}. So together, Joellen and Christine ate 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} of the pizza.


, Evelyn silkscreens a roll of fabric. She cuts the roll into 12 pieces. She sells 5 of the pieces to Catherine. How much of the roll does Evelyn still have?

Since the fabric is cut into 12 pieces, 12 will be the denominator for both fractions.

Since Evelyn begins with the entire roll, 1212{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{12}}} represents how much of the roll she starts off with.

Since Catherine buys 5 pieces, 512{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{12}}} represents the amount of fabric she takes away.

To find out how much of the roll of fabric Evelyn has left, you must calculate 1212−512{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{12}}-{\frac {5}{12}}}.

Subtracting the numerators, you get 12−5=7{\displaystyle 12-5=7}.

Placing the difference of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 1212−512=712{\displaystyle {\frac {12}{12}}-{\frac {5}{12}}={\frac {7}{12}}}. So, after she sells some fabric to Catherine, Evelyn has 712{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{12}}} of her fabric left.


, Donna and her friends are collecting a set of baseball cards. Donna has 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of the cards in the set, with no duplicate cards. She gives 36{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{6}}} of her set of cards to Essie for her birthday. Then Donna gets 26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}} of the set from Grace in exchange for some candy. What fraction of the full set does Donna end up with?

To find out how much of the set Donna has after giving cards to Essie, you must calculate 56−36{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}-{\frac {3}{6}}}.

Subtracting the numerators, you get 5−3=2{\displaystyle 5-3=2}.

Placing the difference of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 56−36=26{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}-{\frac {3}{6}}={\frac {2}{6}}}. So, after she give some cards to Essie, Donna has 26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}} of the set.

To find out how much of the set Donna has after Grace gives her some cards, you must calculate 26+26{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}+{\frac {2}{6}}}.

Adding the numerators, you get 2+2=4{\displaystyle 2+2=4}.

Placing the sum of the numerators over the original denominator, you get 26+26=46{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{6}}+{\frac {2}{6}}={\frac {4}{6}}}. So, after she gets some cards from Grace, Donna has 46{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{6}}} of the set.

The fraction 46{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{6}}} can be reduced, or simplified. The largest number that evenly divides into the numerator and denominator is 2.


4÷2=2{\displaystyle 4\div 2=2} and 6÷2=3{\displaystyle 6\div 2=3}. So, Donna has 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}} of the set of baseball cards after both exchanges.

Ignore the decimal points.,
Set up the multiplication problem vertically.,
Multiply according to the standard algorithm.,
Count the number of decimal places in the two factors.,
Place the decimal in your product.",How to Add and Multiply Decimals2," When multiplying decimals you don’t have to worry about aligning them as you do when adding. So you can forget the decimal points until the last step.For example, if you are multiplying 0.75 and 0.02, you would think about multiplying 075 and 002, or simply 75 and 2.


, Right-align the digits as you would when multiplying any two numbers. For example, vertically set up 75×2{\displaystyle 75\times 2} so that the digits in the ones place, 5 and 2, are aligned.


, Begin with the ones place and find the partial product. Then  multiply the other place values to find their partial products. Add the partial products together and record their sum. For example, 75×2=150{\displaystyle 75\times 2=150}.


, You are looking for the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. Find this number for each factor, then add them together.

For example, 0.75 has 2 places to the right of the decimal point. The other factor, 0.02, also has 2 places to the right of the decimal point. Together, they have 4 places to the right of the decimal point.


, Your product will have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point as your factors do combined. If necessary, expand the decimal places in your answer with zeros.

For example, the product of 0.75 and 0.02 should have 4 digits to the right of the decimal point. So, take the product 150, and imagine a decimal point at the end of the number (after 0). Move the decimal point 4 places to the left. You need to add a 0 in the tenths place, so that the number has four digits to the right of the decimal point. So, 0.75×0.02=0.0150{\displaystyle 0.75\times 0.02=0.0150}, or simply 0.015{\displaystyle 0.015}.

Solve and show your work: Stanley has 10.25 yards of yellow fabric.",How to Add and Multiply Decimals3,"

Since you are adding, you need to set up the numbers with the decimal points aligned.

Make the numbers the same length by turning 4.25 into 4.250.

Add according to the standard algorithm. Ignore the decimal points for now, so that you are adding 4250 and 8598. You should end up with 12848.

Drop the decimal point into the sum. It should align with the decimal points in the two addends. So 12848 becomes 12.848.


,

Since you are multiplying, ignore the decimal point and set up the standard vertical multiplication algorithm. So, you will multiply 53×96{\displaystyle 53\times 96}.

Multiply as normal, finding the partial products and adding them together. You should end up with 5088.

Count the decimal places in the two factors. 5.3 and 9.6 each have 1 decimal place, for a total of 2 decimal places.

Place the decimal into the product. Since combined the factors have 2 places to the right of the decimal point, the product will have 2 places to the right of the decimal point. So take the product 5088 and imagine a decimal point at the end of the number. Move it 2 places to the left. It should sit between the 0 and 8. So, 5088 becomes 50.88.


, Miley has 8.5 yards of yellow fabric. Archie has 12.75 yards of yellow fabric. How many yards of fabric do they have all together?

The phrase “all together” tells us to add. This problem has three numbers, but you add them just like you would two numbers.

Line up the three problems vertically, with the three decimal points aligned.

Make all of the numbers the same length by adding a 0 in the hundredths place of 8.5. So, 8.5 becomes 8.50.

Add according to the standard algorithm. Ignore the decimal points, so that you are adding 1025, 850, and 1275. You should find the sum 3150.

Drop the decimal point into your answer. It should be aligned with the three decimal points of the addends, between the 1 and the 5. So, 3150 becomes 31.50. So, together, Stanley, Miley, and Archie have 31.5 yards of yellow fabric.

The binary system is a base 2 system, so instead of the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands place like we use in the decimal (base 10) system, binary has the ones, twos, fours, and eights place.The ones place is the far right column of your chart, and the eights place is the far left column.

You can continue your place value chart. Each place value is determined by a base 2 exponent.For example:20=ones place{\displaystyle 2^{0}={\text{ones place}}}21=twos place{\displaystyle 2^{1}={\text{twos place}}}22=fours place{\displaystyle 2^{2}={\text{fours place}}}23=eights place{\displaystyle 2^{3}={\text{eights place}}}24=sixteens place{\displaystyle 2^{4}={\text{sixteens place}}}25=thirty-twos place{\displaystyle 2^{5}={\text{thirty-twos place}}}
;
, In the binary system, the only digits used are 1{\displaystyle 1} and 0{\displaystyle 0}.For example, you might write 1 in the eights place, 1 in the fours place, 0 in the twos place, and 1 in the ones place: 1101.


, If there is a 0 in the ones place, the value is 0. If there is a 1 in the ones place, the value is 1.

For example, in the binary number 1101, there is a 1 in the ones place, so the value is 1. So the binary number 1 is equal to the decimal number 1.


, If there is a 0 in the twos place, the value is 0. If there is a 1 in the twos place, the value is 2.

For example, in the binary number 1101, there is a 0 in the twos place, so the value is 0. So the binary number 01 is equal to the decimal number 1, because there are 0 twos and 1 one: 0 + 1 = 1.


, If there is a 0 in the fours place, the value is 0. If there is a 1 in the fours place, the value is 4.

For example, in the binary number 1101, there is a 1 in the fours place, so the value is 4. So the binary number 101 is equal to the decimal number 5, because there are 1 four, 0 twos, and 1 one: 4 + 0 + 1 = 5.


, If there is a 0 in the eights place, the value is 0. If there is a 1 in the eights place, the value is 8.

For example, in the binary number 1101, there is a 1 in the eights place, so the value is 8. So the binary number 1101 is equal to the decimal number 13, because there are 1 eight, 1 four, 0 twos, and 1 one: 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13.


, Since you are only adding two digits, the possible sum is either 0, 1, or 2. If the sum is 0, write a 0 in the answer’s ones place. If the sum is 1, write a 1 in the answer’s ones place. If the sum is 2, write a 0 in the answer’s ones place, and carry a 1 into the twos column.For example, if adding 0111 and 1110, for the ones column you would add 1 one plus 0 ones = 1, so place a 1 in the answer’s ones column.


, The possible sum is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 (if you carried from the ones place). If the sum is 0, write a 0 in the answer’s twos place. If the sum is 1, write a 1 in the answer’s twos place. If the sum is 2, write a 0 in the answer’s twos place, and carry a 1 into the fours column. If the sum is 3, write a 1 in the answer’s twos place, and carry a 1 into the fours column (3 twos = 6 = 1 two and 1 four).

For example, if adding 0111 and 1110, for the twos column you would add 1 two, plus 1 two = 2 twos = 4, so place a 0 in the answer’s twos column and carry a 1 into the fours column.


, The possible sum is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 (if you carried from the twos place). If the sum is 0, write a 0 in the answer’s fours place. If the sum is 1, write a 1 in the answer’s fours place. If the sum is 2, write a 0 in the answer’s fours place, and carry a 1 into the eights column. If the sum is 3, write a 1 on the answer’s fours place, and carry a 1 into the eights column (3 fours = 12 = 1 four and 1 eight).

For example, if adding 0111 and 1110, for the fours column you would add 1 four, plus 1 four, plus 1 four = 3 fours= 12, so place a 1 in the answer’s fours column and carry a 1 into the eights column.


, For simplicity’s sake, you can remember that 0 = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 10, and 3 = 11.

For example, if adding 0111 and 1110, for the eights column you would add up 2 eights, since you carried from the fours column. For a sum of 2, place a 0 in the eights column and carry a 1 into the sixteens column. Since there are no other numbers in the sixteens column, just bring that 1 down to the final answer. So 0111 + 1110 = 10101.


, Circle pairs of 1s (digits) in the ones column. Remember, the ones column in binary is the far right column.

For example, if adding 1010 + 1111 + 1011 + 1110, you should circle 1 pair of 1s.


, For each pair of 1s, carry a 1 into the twos column. If there is only one 1, or if there is one 1 left over after circling pairs of 1s, then write a 1 in the answer’s ones place. If there are no 1s left over, place a 0 in the answer’s ones place.For example, since you circled one pair of 1s, you would carry a 1 into the twos column, and drop a 0 in the answer’s ones place.


, Don’t forget to include any digits you carried over from the ones column.

For example, if adding 1010 + 1111 + 1011 + 1110, you should circle 2 pairs of 1s, and have one 1 left over. 


, For each pair of 1s, carry a 1 into the fours column and drop a 0 into the answer’s twos place. If there is only one 1, or if there is a 1 left over after circling pairs of 1s, then place a 1 into the answer’s twos place. If there are no 1s left over, place a 0 in the answer’s ones place.

For example, since you circled 2 pairs of 1s and had one 1 leftover, you would carry a 1 into the fours column twice, and drop a 1 in the answer’s twos place.


, Don’t forget to include any digits you carried over from the twos column.

For example, if adding 1010 + 1111 + 1011 + 1110, you should circle 2 pairs of 1s, since you carried 1 over twice from the twos column. 


, Carry over a 1 into the eights column for each pair of 1s. Don’t forget to put a 1 in the fours place if you have one 1 left over, or a 0 in the fours place if you have no 1s left over.

For example, since you circled 2 pairs of 1s with none left over, you would carry a 1 into the eights column twice, and place a 0 in the answer’s fours column.


, Don’t forget to carry a 1 into the next column for each circled pair, to place a 1 in the answer if there is a 1 left over, and to place a 0 in the answer if only zeros remain in the column.

For example, if adding 1010 + 1111 + 1011 + 1110, for the eights place you should circle 3 pairs of 1s, since you carried 1 over twice from the fours column. So you would place a 0 in the eights place of your answer and carry three 1s into the sixteens column. In the sixteens column you have one pair of 1s with one 1 left over, so you would place a 1 in the sixteens place of your answer, and a 1 in the thirty-twos column of your answer. So 1010 + 1111 + 1011 + 1110 = 110010.

Do Example 1.,

Do Example 5.",How to Add and Subtract Square Roots," To simplify the terms inside of the radicals, try to factor them to find at least one term that is a perfect square, such as 25 (5 x 5) or 9 (3 x 3). Once you do that, then you can take the square root of the perfect square and write it outside the radical, leaving the remaining factor inside the radical. For this example, we are working with the problem 6√50 - 2√8 + 5√12. The numbers outside the radical sign are the coefficients and the numbers inside it are the radicands. Here's how you simplify each of the terms:6√50 = 6√(25 x 2) = (6 x 5)√2 = 30√2. Here, you've factored ""50"" into ""25 x 2"" and then have pulled out the ""5"" from the perfect square, ""25"", and placed it outside of the radical, with the ""2"" remaining on the inside. Then, you multiplied ""5"" by ""6"", the number already outside the radical, to get 30 as the new coefficient.

2√8 = 2√(4 x 2) = (2 x 2)√2 = 4√2. Here, you've factored ""8"" into ""4 x 2"" and then have pulled out the ""2"" from the perfect square ""4"" and placed it outside the radical, leaving the ""2"" on the inside. Then, you multiplied ""2"" by ""2"", the number already outside the radical, to get 4 as the new coefficient.

5√12 = 5√(4 x 3) = (5 x 2)√3 = 10√3. Here, you've factored ""12"" into ""4 x 3"" and have pulled out the ""2"" from the perfect square ""4"" and placed it outside the radical, leaving the factor ""3"" on the inside. Then, you multiplied ""2"" by ""5"", the number already outside the radical, to get 10 as the new coefficient.;
, Once you simplified the radicands of the terms you were given, you were left with the following equation: 30√2 - 4√2 + 10√3. Since you can only add or subtract like terms, you should circle the terms that have the same radical, which in this example are 30√2 and 4√2. You can think of this as being similar to adding or subtracting fractions, where you can only add or subtract the terms if the denominators are the same.

, Lining the terms up in order will make it easier for you to visualize the solution, too.

, Now, all you have to do is to add or subtract the coefficients of the terms with the matching radicands and leave any additional terms as part of the equation. Do not combine the radicands. The idea is that you are saying how many of that type of radicand there are, total. The non-matching terms can stay as they are. Here's what you do:



30√2 - 4√2 + 10√3 =

(30 - 4)√2 + 10√3 =
26√2 + 10√3

, In this example, you are adding the following square roots: √(45) + 4√5. Here is what you have to do:


Simplify √(45). First, you can factor it out to get √(9 x 5).

Then, you can pull out a ""3"" from the perfect square, ""9,"" and make it the coefficient of the radical. So, √(45) = 3√5.

Now, just add up the coefficients of the two terms with matching radicands to get your answer. 3√5 + 4√5 = 7√5

, This example is the following problem: 6√(40) - 3√(10) + √5. Here is what you have to do to solve it:


Simplify 6√(40). First you can factor out ""40"" to get ""4 x 10"", which makes 6√(40) = 6√(4 x 10).
Then, you can pull out a ""2"" from the perfect square, ""3,"" and then multiply it by the current coefficient. Now you've got 6√(4 x 10) = (6 x 2)√10.

Multiply the two coefficients to get 12√10.

Now, your problem reads 12√10 - 3√(10) + √5. Since the first two terms have the same radicand, you can subtract the second term from the first and leave the third as it is.
You're left with (12-3)√10 + √5, which can be simplified to 9√10 + √5.

, This example is the following: 9√5 -2√3 - 4√5. Here, none of the radicals have factors that are perfect squares, so no simplifying is possible. The first and third terms are like radicals, so their coefficients can already be combined (9 - 4). The radicand is unaffected. The remaining terms are not alike, so the problem can be simplified as 5√5 - 2√3.

, Let's say you're working with the following problem: √9 + √4 - 3√2. Here is what you do:


Since √9 is equal to √(3 x 3), you can simplify √9 to 3.
Since √4 is equal to √(2 x 2), you can simplify √4 to 2.
Now, you can simply add 3 + 2 to get 5.
Since 5 and 3√2 are not like terms, there's nothing more you can do. Your final answer is 5 - 3√2.

, Let's try adding and subtracting square roots that are part of a fraction. Now, as with a regular fraction, you can only add or subtract fractions that have the same numerator or denominator. Let's say you're working with this problem: (√2)/4 + (√2)/2. Here's what you do:


Make it so these terms have the same denominator. The lowest common denominator, or the denominator that would be evenly divisible by both the denominators ""4"" and ""2,"" is ""4.""
So, to make the second term, (√2)/2, have the denominator of 4, you need to multiply both its numerator and denominator by 2/2. (√2)/2 x 2/2 = (2√2)/4.

Add up the numerators of the fractions while leaving the denominator the same. Do just what you would do if you were adding fractions. (√2)/4 + (2√2)/4 = 3√2)/4.

Imagine the numbers.,
Count the stacks: You have 100, right?

,
Imagine what would happen' if you took the penny from stack #1, and put it on the top of stack #100?,
Imagine if you then took the 2 pennies from stack #2 and put them on top of stack #99 (which has 99 pennies in it)?,
Continue with this pattern by putting the 3 pennies from stack #3 on top of stack #98, you will see that this also gives you another stack totaling 101 pennies.
,
Apply this pattern all the way through, and it will hold true for each combination of the stack from the right added to the next stack form the left.,
Combine the stacks in this manner, in your imagination, until you end up with only 50 stacks, and each stack now contains 101 pennies.

,
Quickly add in your head how many pennies you have by counting the stacks of 101 pennies: 101 times 50.,
Since we are multiplying by 101, not 100, you just need to add another 50 to the 5000, and you come up with the correct total of 5050.

,
Use this mental formula to add any series of sequential numbers.",How to Add a Consecutive Series of Numbers in Your Head," Let's suppose that you want to add all the numbers from 1 to 100 in your head. Imagine that on a table in front of you you have arranged stacks of pennies, in a long neat row left to right, to equal each of these numbers. For example, the first stack of pennies starting on the left side of the table is just one penny by itself. Beside it, to its right is a stack of 2 pennies. To the immediate right of the 2 penny stack is a stack of 3 pennies, and so on, clear up to a stack that is 100 pennies tall.;
,, You would have a stack that totaled 101 pennies.

, You would now have another stack of pennies that totaled 101 pennies!
,, You will always end up with a new stack that totals 101 pennies.

,, We know that if you multiply any number by 100, you just add 2 zeros, so 50 times 100 would be 5000.

,, Admittedly, it could get rather hard if the series of numbers aren't in well-rounded chunks of numbers, or if they get too large, but this skill can stand you in good stead in daily life, as it can help your estimating skills, and help keep your mind sharp.

, Imagine or draw a straight, flat line. Make a mark near the middle of your line. Write a 0 or zero next to this mark.


Your math book might call this point the origin, since it's where numbers originate, or start from.

, Write -1 next to the mark on the left and 1 next to the mark on the right. These are the integers closest to zero.


Don't worry about making the spacing perfect - as long as you're close enough that you can tell what it's supposed to mean, the number line will work.
The left side is the side at the beginning of a sentence.

, Make more marks to the left of -1 and to the right of 1. Moving left from -1, label the next marks -2, -3, and -4. Moving right from 1, label the next marks 2, 3, and 4. You can keep going if you have space on your paper.


The example image shows a number line from -6 to 6.

, A positive integer, also called a natural number, is an integer larger than zero. 1, 2, 3, 25, 99, and 2007 are all positive integers. A negative integer is an integer less than zero (like -2, -4 and -88).


An integer is just another way of saying a ""whole number"". Fractions like 1/2 (one half) are only part of a number, so they are not integers. Same with a decimal like 0.25 (zero point two five); decimals are not integers.

, We're going to solve the simple addition problem 1+2 using the number line you just made. The first number in this problem is 1, so start by putting your finger on that number.



Do you think this is too easy? If you've done any addition at all, you probably know the answer to 1+2. That's good: if you know the answer it will be easier to understand how number lines work. Then you can use a number line for more difficult addition problems, or to prepare you for more difficult math like algebra.

, Slide your finger to the right, counting the number of marks (other numbers) you pass by. Once you've hit 2 new marks, stop. The number your finger is pointing to, 3, is the answer.

, Suppose we're figuring out what 3 + 2 is. Start at 3, move to the right or increase by 2. We end up at 5. This is written as 3 + 2 = 5.

, For example, if we have 6 - 4, we start at 6, move left four spaces, and end up at 2. This is written as 6 - 4 = 2.

Make sure that the radicals have the same index.,
Multiply the numbers under the radical signs.,
Simplify the radical expressions.",How to Multiply Radicals1," To multiply radicals using the basic method, they have to have the same index. The ""index"" is the very small number written just to the left of the uppermost line in the radical symbol. If there is no index number, the radical is understood to be a square root (index 2) and can be multiplied with other square roots. You can multiply radicals with different indexes, but that is a more advanced method and will be explained later. Here are two examples of multiplication using radicals with the same indexes:



Ex. 1: √(18) x √(2) = ?

Ex. 2: √(10) x √(5) = ?

Ex. 3: 3√(3) x 3√(9) = ?;
, Next, simply multiply the numbers under the radical or square root signs and keep them there. Here's how you do it:



Ex. 1: √(18) x √(2) = √(36)

Ex. 2: √(10) x √(5) = √(50)

Ex. 3: 3√(3) x 3√(9) = 3√(27)

, If you've multiplied radicals, there's a good chance that they can be simplified to perfect squares or perfect cubes, or that they can be simplified by finding a perfect square as a factor of the final product. Here's how you do it:



Ex. 1: √(36) = 6. 36 is a perfect square because it is the product of 6 x 6. The square root of 36 is simply 6.

Ex. 2: √(50) = √(25 x 2) = √(x 2) = 5√(2). Though 50 is not a perfect square, 25 is a factor of 50 (because it divides evenly into the number) and is a perfect square. You can break 25 down into its factors, 5 x 5, and move one 5 out of the square root sign to simplify the expression.

You can think of it like this: If you throw the 5 back under the radical, it is multiplied by itself and becomes 25 again.



Ex. 3:3√(27) = 3. 27 is a perfect cube because it's the product of 3 x 3 x 3. The cube root of 27 is therefore 3.

Double check using your hands!",How to Add1," Take a handful of beans (or other small objects). Set one bean aside at a time into a pile and count each one as you go (1, 2, 3, etc). Stop after you have a few beans in the pile. How many did you put there? Write that number down. Now, do the same thing but make another pile. Now, put the two piles together. How many do you have now? You can count up each bean, one at a time, and find out! This is adding!


For example, your first pile might have 5 beans. Then your second pile might have 3 beans. When you put the two piles together and count all the beans, you'll find that you now have 8 beans! This is because 5 + 3 is 8.;
, Since most people base counting on sets of ten and numbers divisible by ten, you can make adding much easier by learning what number pairs add up to ten. Examples include: 1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6, and 5+5.

, Pair up as many of the numbers that you have as possible, in order to make sets of ten.


Let's say you're adding this string of numbers: 2, 16, 9, 3, 5, 18. You can pair the 2 with the 18 to get 20. 4 pairs nicely with 6, so take 4 from the 5 and add it to the 16 to get another 20. Then you have 1 (left over after getting 4 from the 5), which you can add to the 9 to get 10.

, Count the numbers that you have by hand or in your head, starting from the sets of ten that you have. Oops, in the picture there is a 6 instead of 16; so, that picture has 10 fewer than the number added above and explained below.


In the example from the previous step, you have the 3 extra, after the 50 you already counted up from the paired numbers making 20, plus the other 20 plus 10 and adding 3 extra for a total of 53 (your answer). That was pretty easy to add in your head as: 20 + 20 = 40, and 10 more = 50, so 50 + 3 = 53 (of course you could say ""20 is 2 tens"", and ""20 and 20 is 4 tens"", now ""plus 10 makes 5 tens which is 50"", then ""plus 3"" is 53).

, When you can, you can always double check your math using your fingers or another method, such as making marks to keep extra ones and for groups of 5 and 10. Players often add tally marks for keeping the score/""the tally"" in a game such as dominoes.

, Positive numbers are increases, or movements right on the number line. Negative numbers are decreases, or movements left on the number line. Adding a negative number moves the pointer left on the number line.


For example, let's add 1 and -4. In the standard, familiar number writing you're used to, this is just:1 + (-4)

On a number line, we start at 1, move 4 spaces left, and end up at -3.

, Notice that -3, our answer, is the same thing we'd get if we just did 1 - 4. Adding 1 + (-4) and subtracting 4 from 1 are the same. We can write this as as an equation, a kind of mathematical sentence showing one things equals another:1 + (-4) = 1 - 4 = -3

, As we can see from our simple equation above, we can go both ways — changing ""add a negative number"" to ""subtract a positive number"" and vice versa. You might have just been taught ""change a minus-plus to a minus"" without really knowing why — this is why.


For example, consider -4. When we add -4 to 1, it decreases 1 by 4. We can ""say this in math"" by writing1 + (-4) = 1 - 4

We'd write this on a number line, as starting with our pointer at 1, then adding a move 4 spaces to the left (in other words, adding a -4). Since it's an equation, one thing equals another - so the reverse works too:1 - 4 = 1 + (-4)


, On a number line, subtracting a negative is a decrease in the length of a decrease. Let's start with 5 - 8.


On a number line, we start with our pointer at 5, decrease by 8, and arrive with our pointer at -3.

, Suppose we decrease the amount we're decreasing by one less, or in other words subtract 7 instead of 8. Now we move one less space to the left on the number line. In written terms, we started with5 - 8 = -3

Now we'll only be moving 7 left, so we have5 - 7 = -2

, For our example, we decrease the amount we go left by 1. In equation terms, we could write our shorter move as:5 - 7 = -2 = 5 - (8 - 1)

, Using our step of ""change all subtraction to addition"", we could write our shorter move now as:5 - (8 - 1) = 5 - 7 = 5 - 8 + 1

.


We already know that 5 - 8 = -3, so let's take 5 - 8 out of our equation now and put in -3:5 - (8 - 1) = 5 - 7 = -3 + 1

We already know what 5 - (8 - 1) is — it's going one space less than 5 - 8. Our equation can show the fact that 5 - 8 gives us -3, and going one space short gives us -2. Our equation can be written like this now:-3 - (-1) = -3 + 1


, Notice what's happened at the end of this - we've proved that:-3 + 1 = -3 - (-1)

We can express this as a simple, more general rule for writing math:first number plus a second number = first number minus (negative second number)

Or, in more simple terms like you've probably heard in a math class:Change two minuses to a plus

Write a + to the left of the bottom number, and a line underneath it, just as you probably learned to do for smaller addition problems.

, It might seem a little odd to start from the right, since when reading numbers we start from the left. We have to add in this order to get the right answer, though, as you'll see later on.


Underneath the two numbers to the right, 3 and 1, write what you get when you add them together: 4.

, Moving left, you'll add 0+6, 5+4, and 2+7. Write the answers below each pair of numbers.


You should end up with the answer to the problem: 9,964. Check your work if you made a mistake.

, You should notice something different as soon as add the first pair of numbers on the right. 7+5 equals 12, a two digit number, but you can only write one digit beneath that column. Keep reading to find out what to do, and why you always need to start on the right instead of the left.

, 7+5=12, but you shouldn't put both the 1 and the 2 underneath the bottom line. Instead, put the last digit, 2, underneath the line and put the first digit, 1, above the column to the left, 5+3.


If you're curious about how this works, think about what dividing the 1 and 2 means. You've actually split 12 into 10 and 2. You can write the full 10 above the numbers if you want, and you'll see that the 1 lines up with the 5 and 3, just like before.

, You now have three digits to add for this number, since you added a 1 to this column. The answer is 9, so your answer so far should be 92.

, Keep moving left until you've added all the numbers, in this case just one more column. Your final answer should be 992.


You can try more complicated problems, like 974+568. Remember, each time you get a two digit number, only write the last digit as the answer, and put the other digit above the column to the left, the one you'll add together next. If the last column ends up with a two digit number, you can just write it as your answer.

You can write a 0 underneath the 4 if it helps you keep track of which number is above which other number. You can always add zeros in front of a number without changing it. Make sure to add it in front of the number and not after it.

, Always start from the right. Solve for 3-2, 1-0, 7-5, and 4-0, putting the answer to each problem directly underneath the two numbers in that subtraction problem.


You should end up with the answer, 4,211.

, These numbers are the same length, so you can line them up easily. This problem will teach you something new about subtracting integers, if you didn't know it already.

, This is 4 - 8. This is tricky, since 4 is smaller than 8, but don't use negative numbers. Instead, follow these steps:


On the top line, cross out the 2 and write 1 instead. The 2 should be directly to the left of the 4.
Cross out the 4 and write 14. Do this in a small space so it's clear the 14 is entirely above the 8. You can also just write a 1 in front of the 4 to make it 14 if you have the room.
What you just did is ""borrow"" a 1 from the tens place, or second column from the right, and turn it into 10 in the ones place, or furthest column to the right. one 10 is the same as ten 1s, so this is still the same problem.

, You should now have a 6 on the far right of the line where your answer will be.

, This should now be 1 - 1, which equals 0.


Your answer so far should be 06.

, 9 - 5=4, so your final answer is 406.

, Say you're asked to solve 415,990 - 968,772. You write the second number underneath the first, and then realize the number at the bottom is larger! You can tell this immediately by the first digits on the left: 9 is smaller than 4, so the number beginning with 9 has to be larger.


Make sure to line the numbers up correctly before comparing them. 912 is not bigger than 5000, which you can tell if you've lined them up correctly, since the 5 is above nothing at all. You can add leading zeros if it helps, for instance writing 912 as 0912 so it lines up well with 5000.

, Whenever you subtract a number from a smaller number, you'll get a negative number as your answer. It's best to write this sign before solving, so you don't forget to include it.

, Your answer will be negative, as you showed by writing a - sign. Do not try to subtract the larger number from the smaller and just make it negative; you will not get the wrong answer.

Multiply the coefficients.,
Multiply the numbers inside the radicals.,

3 x 1 = 3



Ex. 2: 4√(3) x 3√(6) = 12√( ? )

4 x 3 = 12



, After you've multiplied the coefficients, you can multiply the numbers inside the radicals. Here's how you do it:

, Next, simplify the numbers under the radicals by looking for perfect squares or multiples of the numbers under the radicals that are perfect squares. Once you've simplified those terms, just multiply them by their corresponding coefficients. Here's how you do it:


3√(20) = 3√(4 x 5) = 3√(x 5) = (3 x 2)√(5) = 6√(5)

, For the expression 3√(5), you'd need to multiply the index of 3 by 2 to get 6. For the expression 2√(2), you'd need to multiply the index of 2 by 3 to get 6.

, For the first equation, make the number 2 the exponent over the number 5. For the second equation, make the number 3 the exponent over the number 2. Here's what it would look like:



2 --> 6√(5) = 6√(5)2


3 --> 6√(2) = 6√(2)3


, Here's how you do it:



6√(5)2 = 6√(5 x 5) = 6√25

6√(2)3 = 6√(2 x 2 x 2) = 6√8

, Place them under a radical and connect them with a multiplication sign. Here's what the result would look like: 6√(8 x 25)

, 6√(8 x 25) = 6√(200). This is the final answer. In some cases, you may be able to simplify these expressions -- for example, you could simplify this expression if you found a number that can be multiplied by itself six times that is a factor of 200. But in this case, the expression cannot be simplified any further.

Learn the number places.,
Line up the numbers.,
Add the first column.,
Carry the tens.,
Count the next column.,
Get the final sum.",How to Add2," When you write numbers, each spot in the line has a name or type. Learn these spots to help you line up the numbers correctly so you can add them. For example:


2 by itself is in the ""ones"" place.
In the number 20, the two is in the ""tens"" place.
In the number 200, the two is in the ""hundreds"" place.
So, in the number 365, the five is in the ones place, the six is in the tens place, and the 3 is in the hundreds place.

, Line up the numbers so that each full number that you have to add is on top of the other. The ""places"" are what you'll use to line the numbers up, so that all of the ones place numbers are right above one another. Leave a space to the left when you have a number that is smaller than the others. For example, when adding 16, 4, and 342, you should write it like this:


342
_16
__4

, Start with the right-most column and add the numbers together. Once you know the sum (how much you get when the numbers are added together), write the number in the ones place below all of the numbers you're adding, at the bottom of the ones place column.


In our above example, we get 12 when adding the 2, 6, and 4 together. Write the 2 from the 12 at the bottom of the right-most column.

, If you have a number in the tens place, write the tens place number at the top of the next column (to the left).


We have a number in the tens place in this example, so write the 1 from the 12 at the top of the middle column, above the 4 in 342.

, Move to the next column to the left and count all the numbers in this column, including the one you might have added from the previous step. Write the number you get at the bottom of the column, carrying any number in the tens place like before.


For this example, we count the 1 from the 12, plus the 4 from the 342, and the 1 from the 16. This gives us 6.

, Repeat these counting steps, moving from right to left from column to column, until all of your columns are done. The number that you have at the bottom when you're done is the sum.


In this example, the sum is 362.

"
"
Line up the decimals.,
Add a decimal if there isn't one.,
Add as normal.",How to Add3," When you have a decimal in a number (for example, 24.5), you'll have to be a little more careful when adding in columns. The main trick is to line up all the numbers using the decimal. The decimals need to be in their own column. For example: 107.8 + 24.5 + 3.2 + 15 should be rewritten to line them up.


107.8
_24.5
__3.2
_15.0

, If a number doesn't have a decimal point, add one and put zeros to the right of it, to help keep your number columns straight.


In the above example, the 15 did not have the zero after it, so it was added to make the columns easier to see.

, Once you have your numbers lined up, you just add them together as you normally would.


The sum for this example would be 150.5 (or if that is dollars $150.50 if you prefer because in the place value system .5 = 5 dimes or tenths of a dollar and .50 = 50 cents or hundredths of a dollar and 5/10 = 50/100 because each is in the ratio of 1 to 2 which equals 1/2 of a dollar).

Make the denominator the same.,
Add the numerator.,
Get your sum.,
Simplify the fraction.",How to Add4," The denominator is the number on the bottom of the fraction. You need to make them the same in order to add the fractions together. This is done by multiplying (or dividing) both the top and bottom number on one of the fractions, until the bottom number equals the bottom number in the other fraction. For example, let's say that you want to add 1/8 and 3/4:


You need to make the 4 and the 8 the same. How do you turn a 4 into an 8? Multiply by 2!
Multiply the 3 and the 4 in the 3/4 fraction by 2. This gives you 6/8.

, The numerator is the number on the top of the fraction. Now that you have 1/8 and 6/8, add the 1 and the 6 together to get 7.

, Take the added numerators and place them over the top of the denominator. The denominator stays the same. This means that the sum of the fractions is 7/8.

, You may want to make the fraction simpler to read, by using the smallest numbers possible in the top and bottom spots to convey the same over-all amount. In this example, we do not need to simplify it. It's as small as it can get. But if you had a fraction that was, say, 3/6, you might want to make that simpler.


This is done by finding the smallest number that both the numerator and denominator are divisible by. In this case, it's 3. Divide each number by 3 to get the reduced fraction, in this case 1/2.

Try compensating with easier numbers.,
Break into sets of round numbers.,
Add them in parts.,
Use the shape of the number.",How to Add5," If you have only a few numbers to keep track of, but the numbers don't fit well into sets of 10s, you can add or subtract numbers to make it easier to add in your head. For example, let's say you need to add 19 + 30. It would be much easier to add 20 + 30, right? So add one to the 19! All you have to do is take the number that you added away again in order to get the final sum. So: 19 + 1 + 30 = 50 and 50 - 1 = 49.

, Similar to the pairing of numbers that was discussed in the first section, try to find groups of numbers that add to either 5 or 10 (or 50, 100, 500, and 1000, etc). Add the groups together to make things easier.


So, for example, 7+1+2=10 and 2+3=5, so if you had to add 1+2+2+3+7, you'd get 15.

, Break up ones and tens to make the numbers easier to count, adding together the tens and then just worrying about the ones. For example, for some people, it might be easier to add 40+30+10 and then 2+5+7, instead of 42+35+17.

, If you just want to quickly add in your head without making columns and the grouping methods don't work for you, you can use the shape of the numbers themselves to count, instead of relying on your fingers. This is best if you only have a handful of numbers to count up though. For example:


The number 2 has two end points. Same with the number 3.
The numbers 4 and 5 have their respective number of end points and conjunctions, with the round curve of the 5 counting as one conjunction.
Some numbers like 6, 7, 8, and 9 are less obvious. The curve of the 6 and 9 get counted as three points (top, middle, and bottom) and get counted twice for 6 and three times for 9. Each side of each round on the 8 gets counted as 1 (4 total), which gets counted twice to get 8. The 7 gets counted with 3 points for the short top side and 4 points for the longer side.

First separate 53 into 50 and 3.
Now 50 X 5 = 250.
Also 3 X 5 = 15.
Now add those separate answers. 250 + 15 = 265.;
, Then the other 4 are (x - 1), (x), (x + 1) and (x + 2).
The sum: (x - 2) + (x - 1) + (x) + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 5x
Using the above method: 10x/2 = 5x

Convert your first mixed number to an improper fraction.,
Convert your second mixed number to an improper fraction.,
Multiply the two improper fractions.,
Reduce your answer to the lowest terms.,
Convert your answer to a mixed number.,
Finished!41/2 x 62/5 = 284/5

",How to Multiply Mixed Numbers,", An improper fraction is a number that has a numerator that is larger than its denominator. You can convert a mixed number to an improper fraction in just these easy steps:



Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction.
If you are converting the number 41/2 to an improper fraction, you would first multiply the whole number 4 by the denominator of the fraction which is 2. So, 4 x 2 = 8

Add this number to the numerator of the fraction.
So adding 8 to the numerator 1, we get 8 + 1 = 9.

Place this new number over the original denominator of the fraction.
The new number is 9, so you can place it over 2, the original denominator.
The mixed number 41/2 converts to the improper fraction 9/2.

,
Follow exactly the same steps as described above:



Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction.
If you are converting the number 62/5 to an improper fraction, you would first multiply the whole number 6 by the denominator of the fraction which is 5. So, 6 x 5 = 30

Add this number to the numerator of the fraction.
So adding 30 to the numerator 2, we get 30 + 2 = 32.

Place this new number over the original denominator of the fraction.
The new number is 32, so you can place it over 5, the original denominator.
The mixed number 62/5 converts to the improper fraction 32/5.

, Once you've converted each of your mixed numbers to improper fractions, you can multiply them. To multiply the numbers, just multiply their numerators and multiply their denominators.


To multiply 9/2 and 32/5, you should multiply the numerators, 9 and 32. So 9 x 32 = 288.
Next, multiply the denominators, 2 and 5, to get 10.
Place the new numerator over the new denominator to get 288/10.

, To reduce your fraction to the lowest terms, find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF), which is the biggest number that is divisible by both the numerator and the denominator. Then divide the numerator and denominator by this number.


2 is the greatest common factor of both 288 and 10. Divide 288 by 2 to get 144, and divide 10 by 2 to get 5.288/10 is reduced to 144/5.

, Since the question is in mixed number form, the answer should be in mixed number form as well. To convert it to the mixed number, you have to work backwards to get your answer. Here's how you do it:


First, divide the top number by the bottom number.
Do long division to divide 5 into 144. 5 goes 28 times into 144. This means that the quotient is 28. The remainder, or the number that is left over, is 4.
Make your quotient the new whole number. Take your remainder and place it over the original denominator to finish converting the improper fraction into a mixed number.
The quotient is 28, the remainder is 4, and the original denominator was 5, so 144/5 expressed as a mixed fraction is 284/5.

Learn what to do if this turns into a subtraction problem with a smaller number first.,
Learn how to add two negative integers.,
Learn how to subtract a negative integer.",How to Add and Subtract Integers5," Adding a negative integer is the same as subtracting a positive one. This is easier to see by testing this out with the number line method described in another section, but you can think about it in words too. A negative number is not a normal quantity; it is less than zero, and can represent an amount being taken away. If you add this ""taking away"" to a normal number, you'll end up making it smaller.


Example: 10 + -3 = 10 - 3 = 7
Example: -12 + 18 = 18 + -12 = 18 – 12 = 6. Remember that you can always switch the order of numbers in an addition problem, but not in a subtraction problem.

, Sometimes turning your addition problem into a subtraction problem as described above can end up with odd results like 4 – 7. When this happens, reverse the order of the numbers and make your answer negative.


Say you begin with 4 + -7.
Turn this into a subtraction problem: 4 - 7
Reverse the order and make it negative: -(7 – 4) = -(3) = -3.
If you aren't used to parentheses in your equations yet, think of it like this: 4 - 7 turns into 7 - 4 with a minus sign added. 7 - 4 = 3 but I should make it -3 for the right answer to the problem 4 - 7.

, Two negative numbers added together will always make a number more negative. There is nothing positive being added, so you'll always end up with something further from 0. Finding the answer is simple:


-3 + -6 = -9
-15 + -5 = -20
Do you see the pattern? All you need to do is add the numbers as though they were positive and add a negative sign. -4 + -3 = -(4 + 3) = -7

, Just like the addition problems, you can rewrite these so you only have to deal with positive numbers. If you're subtracting a negative number, you're ""taking away"" some ""stuff taken away"", which is the same as adding a positive number.


Think of the negative number as stolen money. If you ""subtract"", or take away, some stolen money so you can return it, that's the same as giving that person money, right?
Example: 10 – -5 = 10 + 5 = 15
Example: -1 – -2 = -1 + 2. You already learned how to solve this problem in an early step, remember? Reread Learn how to add a negative and a positive number if you don't remember.
Here's the full solution to the last example: -1 – -2 = -1 + 2 = 2 + -1 = 2 – 1 = 1.

Identify a factorial.,
Evaluate a factorial using a formula.,
Calculate a factorial.",How to Multiply Factorials1," A factorial, denoted by a whole number with an exclamation point, is the product of a series of sequential whole numbers.For example, 6!{\displaystyle 6!} is a factorial.
;
, The formula is n!=n(n−1)(n−2)⋅⋅⋅3⋅2⋅1{\displaystyle n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdot \cdot \cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}.This means that you extend the sequence of numbers until you get to 1.

For example, 6!=6(6−1)(6−2)(6−3)(6−4)(6−5)=6(5)(4)(3)(2)(1){\displaystyle 6!=6(6-1)(6-2)(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)=6(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}


, To calculate a factorial, begin with the denoted number, and multiply it by each sequential whole number, down to 1.A quick way to calculate a factorial is to use the x!{\displaystyle x!} key on a scientific calculator. First hit the number, then hit the x!{\displaystyle x!} key to see the product.

For example, 6!=6×5×4×3×2×1=720{\displaystyle 6!=6\times 5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=720}.

Identify the larger number.,
Line up the problems vertically.,
Subtract the digits in the ones place.,
Subtract the digits in the tens place.,
Subtract the digits in the hundreds place.,
Subtract the digits in the thousands place.,
Check your answer.",How to Subtract Thousands1," Generally when subtracting, you subtract the smaller number from the larger number, which results in a positive answer, or difference., The larger number should be on the top. Ensure the digits in each place value are lined up; that is, the ones place in the top number should be lined up vertically with the ones place in the bottom number, the tens place in the top should be lined up with the tens place in the bottom, etc.The place values in a 4-digit number, from right-to-left, are the ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and thousands place.

The place values should always be aligned. Even if you are subtracting a 4-digit number from a 1-digit number. Since a 1-digit number only has ones, you will align this number with the digit in the ones place of the larger number.


, Remember, the ones place is on the far right. If the bottom digit is larger than the top digit, you must borrow a ten from the tens place. To do this, subtract 1 from the digit in the tens place, and add 10 to the digit in the ones place. Make sure you cross out the original digits and write the new numbers after borrowing.For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 4−6{\displaystyle 4-6} in the ones place. Since 6 is larger than 4, you must borrow from the tens place. The 1 in the tens place becomes a 0, and the 4 in the ones place becomes 14. So now you will calculate 14−6=8{\displaystyle 14-6=8}. So the digit in the ones place of your answer is 8.


, The tens place is the digit second from the right. Remember to use the new digit if you borrowed from the tens place when subtracting the ones place. If the bottom digit is larger than the top digit, you will have to borrow from the hundreds place. To borrow from the hundreds place, follow the same procedure you used when borrowing from the tens place.

For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 0−4{\displaystyle 0-4} in the tens place, since you borrowed a ten when subtracting ones. Since 4 is larger than 0, you must borrow from the hundreds place. The 9 in the hundreds place becomes an 8 , and the 0 in the tens place becomes 10. So now you will calculate 10−4=6{\displaystyle 10-4=6}. So the digit in the tens place of your answer is 6.


, The hundreds place is the digit third from the right. Remember to use the new digit if you borrowed previously, and to borrow from the thousands place, using the same borrowing procedure, if the bottom digit is larger than the top digit.

For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 8−3{\displaystyle 8-3} in the hundreds place, since you borrowed a hundred when subtracting tens. 8−3=5{\displaystyle 8-3=5}. So the digit in the hundreds place of your answer is 5.


, The thousands place is the digit on the far left. Make sure you use any new digits after borrowing. You will not have to borrow in the thousands place, since the top number is ultimately larger than the bottom number.

For example, if you are calculating 5,914−2,346{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346}, you will subtract 5−2{\displaystyle 5-2} in the thousands place. 5−2=3{\displaystyle 5-2=3}. So, 5,914−2,346=3,568{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346=3,568}.


, Since it is easy to make mistakes when subtracting larger numbers, it is always a good idea to check your answer with a calculator.

Calculate the first factorial.,
Calculate the second factorial.,
Multiply the two factorials’ products.",How to Multiply Factorials2," Use a calculator for larger numbers. If calculating by hand, make sure you multiply each sequential number, down to 1. Rewrite the equation with this product in parentheses as the first factor.

For example, if you are calculating 5!×7!{\displaystyle 5!\times 7!}, first calculate 5!{\displaystyle 5!}:5!×7!{\displaystyle 5!\times 7!}=(5×4×3×2×1)×(7!){\displaystyle =(5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1)\times (7!)}=(120)×(7!){\displaystyle =(120)\times (7!)}


, You can do this by calculator or by hand, beginning on the complexity of the factorial. Rewrite the equation with this product as the second factor.

For example:(120)×(7!){\displaystyle (120)\times (7!)}=(120)×(7×6×5×4×3×2×1){\displaystyle =(120)\times (7\times 6\times 5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1)}=(120)×(5040){\displaystyle =(120)\times (5040)}


, This will give you the product of the two factorials. Since factorials tend to be large numbers, using a calculator will make this calculation easier.

For example, (120)×(5040)=604,800{\displaystyle (120)\times (5040)=604,800}. So, 5!×7!=604,800{\displaystyle 5!\times 7!=604,800}.

Multiply the remaining factors.",How to Multiply Factorials3," The formula is n!=n×(n−1)!{\displaystyle n!=n\times (n-1)!}. This means that a smaller factorial is a factor of a larger factorial.For example, 4!=4×(4−1)!=4×3!{\displaystyle 4!=4\times (4-1)!=4\times 3!}. When you are multiplying two factorials, the largest common factorial is the smaller of the two factorials.

For example, if you are calculating 5!×7!{\displaystyle 5!\times 7!}, you can factor out 5!{\displaystyle 5!} from 7!{\displaystyle 7!}:5!×5!(7×6){\displaystyle 5!\times 5!(7\times 6)}


, Then, calculate the factorial and square its product.

For example, 5!×5!(7×6){\displaystyle 5!\times 5!(7\times 6)}=7×6×(5!)2{\displaystyle =7\times 6\times (5!)^{2}}=42×(120)2{\displaystyle =42\times (120)^{2}}


, The result will be the product of the two original factorials.

For example: 42×(120)2{\displaystyle 42\times (120)^{2}}=42×14,400{\displaystyle =42\times 14,400}=604,800{\displaystyle =604,800}

Identify the larger number.,
Line up the problems vertically.,
Subtract the digits in each place value.,
Place a negative sign in front of your answer.,
Check your answer.",How to Subtract Thousands2," Usually in subtraction, you will subtract a smaller number from a larger number. Sometimes, however, you will be asked to subtract a larger number from a smaller number. In this instance, the answer, or difference, will be negative.For example, if you are subtracting 2,346−5,914{\displaystyle 2,346-5,914}, you should note that 5,914 is larger. Since you are subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, your answer will be negative.


, Even though you are supposed to subtract the larger number from the smaller, for this method you need to place the larger number on top. Ensure the digits in each place value are lined up. The place values in a 4-digit whole number, from right-to-left, are the ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and thousands place.

For example, if you are subtracting 2,346−5,914{\displaystyle 2,346-5,914}, even though you are supposed to take away 5,914, you will set up the problem with 5,914 on top. 


, You will need to borrow from other place values if the digit on top is smaller than the digit on the bottom.

For example, after borrowing to subtract the digits in each place value, you should calculate 5,914−2,346=3,568{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346=3,568}.


, The difference between two numbers is always the same, regardless of how you subtract them. Remember, however, that when subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, as the original problem stated, the answer will result in a negative number.For example, if 5,914−2,346=3,568{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346=3,568}, then 2,346−5,914=−3,568{\displaystyle 2,346-5,914=-3,568}.


, It is easy to make mistakes when you need to borrow to subtract, so it’s a good idea to check your answer with a calculator.

Line up the problems vertically.,
Subtract the digits in each place value.,
Drop the decimal point into your answer.,
Check your answer.",How to Subtract Thousands3," The number you are subtracting from should be on top, and the decimal points should be aligned, as well as the digits in each place value. Fill any blank spaces in front of a decimal with zeros. For whole numbers, place a decimal point to the right of the ones place, and fill any blank space behind the number with zeros.For example, if you are subtracting 4,750−136.2{\displaystyle 4,750-136.2}, you would place a decimal after the 0 in 4,750, and set up the problem with 4,750.0 on top of 0136.2.


, Ignore the decimal points for now, and subtract as if you were working with two whole numbers.You will need to borrow from other place values if the digit on top is smaller than the digit on the bottom.

For example, after borrowing to subtract the digits in each place value, you should calculate 4,750.0−0136.2=46138{\displaystyle 4,750.0-0136.2=46138}.


, The point in your answer should be aligned with the points in the numbers you were subtracting.For example, if you calculate 4,750.0−0136.2=46138{\displaystyle 4,750.0-0136.2=46138}, you need to drop your decimal point in your answer so that it aligns with the other decimal points. So the answer is 4613.8.


, In a problem like this, it is easy to make a mistake when aligning decimals or borrowing, so it never hurts to check your answer with a calculator.

Choose the correct table.,
Find the correct cell.,
Use smaller chart for precise numbers.,
Prefix a decimal point.,
Find the integer portion.",How to Use Logarithmic Tables1," To find loga(n), you'll need a loga table. Most log tables are for base-10 logarithms, called ""common logs.""

Example: log10(31.62) requires a base-10 table.
;
, Look for the cell value at the following intersections, ignoring all decimal places:

Row labeled with first two digits of n 

Column header with third digit of n

Example: log10(31.62) → row 31, column 6 → cell value 0.4997.


, Some tables have a smaller set of columns on the right side of the chart. Use these to adjust answer if n has four or more significant digits:

Stay in same row

Find small column header with fourth digit of n

Add this to previous value

Example: log10(31.62) → row 31, small column 2 → cell value 2 → 4997 + 2 = 4999.


, The log table only tells you the portion of your answer after the decimal point. This is called the ""mantissa.""

Example: Solution so far is ?.4999


, Also called the ""characteristic"". By trial and error, find integer value of p such that ap<n{\displaystyle a^{p}<n} and ap+1>n{\displaystyle a^{p+1}>n}.

Example: 101=10<31.62{\displaystyle 10^{1}=10<31.62} and 102=100>31.62{\displaystyle 10^{2}=100>31.62}. The ""characteristic"" is 1. The final answer is 1.4999

Note how easy this is for base-10 logs. Just count the digits left of the decimal and subtract one.

Move the decimal point of the whole number to the right that number of times.,
Fill in the extra space with a zero.,
Check your work.",How to Multiply Decimals," If one number has more digits, you can put the number on top of the other. Let's say you're multiplying .43 by .06. Just line one number on top of the other, above the multiplication bar.;
, Now, just multiply the numbers as you usually would in ordinary multiplication. Here's how you would multiply .43 and .06:


Start by multiplying the 6 in .06 by the 3 in .43 to get 18. Write ""8"" below the 6 and carry the 1 on top of the 4.
Multiply the 6 by the 4 in .43 to get 24. Add 24 to the 1 that was on top of the 4 to get 25. The top row should read 258.
When you start multiplying .43 by 0, you'll see that you only get 0, so there's no need to write anything down.
The answer is 258 while you're ignoring the decimal points.

, There are two numbers to the right of .43 (4 and 3), and there are two numbers to the right of .06 (0 and 6). Therefore, add 2 and 2 to get 4, the total amount of numbers to the right of both decimal points.

, Since you counted 4 numbers, start with the decimal point at the end of the whole number 258, and move it over four times to the right starting to the right of the 8. You'll end up moving it one space right past the 2 in 258.

, Since there's a blank space between the decimal point at the 2, fill it in with a zero. 258 becomes "".0258.""

, If you want to make sure that .43 multiplied by .06 is indeed .0258, you can divide .0258 by .06 to make sure that you get .43. So, .0258 ÷ .06 = .43. You can check your work by dividing the answer by either number to get the other. Therefore, you can divide .0258 by .43 to make sure you get .06. Does it work? .0258 ÷ .43 = .06. You're all done. .43 ÷ .06 = .0258.

Learn the formula.,
Multiply x{\displaystyle x} by 10.,
Subtract x{\displaystyle x} from 10x{\displaystyle 10x}.",How to Multiply by 9's in Your Head1," The formula is 9x=10x−x{\displaystyle 9x=10x-x}. This method works for 9 times any number. In this instance, identify the factor you are multiplying by 9 as x{\displaystyle x}.

, Multiplying a number by 10 is easy to do in your head. All you need to do is add a zero to the end of the number.

For example:9(115)=10(115)−115{\displaystyle 9(115)=10(115)-115}9(115)=1150−115{\displaystyle 9(115)=1150-115}


, This will give you the product of 9x{\displaystyle 9x}.For example, 9(115)=1150−115=1035{\displaystyle 9(115)=1150-115=1035}.

Know your integers.,
Know your basic times tables.",How to Multiply and Divide Integers1," An integer is any whole number that can be represented without using a fraction or decimal. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. For instance, the following numbers are integers: 1, 99, -217, and 0. However, these numbers are not: -10.4, 6 ¾, 2.12.


Absolute values can be integers, but they are not necessarily. An absolute value of any number is the ""size"" or ""amount"" of the number, regardless of its sign. Another way to put this is that a given number's absolute value is that number's distance from zero. So, the absolute value of an integer is always an integer. For example, the absolute value of -12 is 12. The absolute value of 3 is 3. The absolute value of 0 is 0.

The absolute values of numbers that are not integers, however, will never be integers. For example, the absolute value of 1/11 is 1/11 - a fraction, and therefore not an integer.



, The process of multiplying or dividing integers, whether they're large or small, is much, much quicker and easier if you have memorized the products of every pair of numbers from 1 to 10. This information is usually referred to in school as ""times tables"". As a refresher, below is a basic 10X10 times table. The numbers across the top and left side of the table list the numbers from 1 to 10. To find the product of two of these numbers, find the cell where the row and column of your two desired numbers intersect:"
"
Understand what a logarithm is.,
Identify the characteristic of the number whose log you want to find.,
Slide your finger down to the appropriate row on the table using the leftmost column.,
On the appropriate row, slide your finger over to the appropriate column.,
If your log table has a mean difference table, slide your finger over to the column in that table marked with the next digit of the number you're looking up.,
Add the numbers found in the two preceding steps together.,
Add the characteristic.",How to Use Logarithmic Tables2," 102 is 100. 103 is 1000. The powers 2 and 3 are the base-10 logarithms of 100 and 1000.In general, ab = c can be rewritten as logac = b. So, saying ""ten to the power of two is 100"" is equivalent to saying ""the base-ten log of 100 is two."" Each logarithmic table is only usable with a certain base (a in the equation above). By far the most common type of log table uses base-10 logs, also called the common logarithm.

 Multiply two numbers by adding their powers. For example: 102 * 103 = 105, or 100 * 1000 = 100,000. 

 The natural log, represented by ""ln"", is the base-e log, where e is the constant 2.718. This is a useful number in many areas of math and physics. You can use natural log tables in the same way that you use common, or base-10, log tables. 


, Let's say you want to find the base-10 log of 15 on a common log table. 15 lies between 10 (101) and 100 (102), so its logarithm will lie between 1 and 2, or be 1.something. 150 lies between 100 (102) and 1000 (103), so its logarithm will lie between 2 and 3, or be 2.something. The .something is called the mantissa; this is what you will find in the log table. What comes before the decimal point (1 in the first example, 2 in the second) is the characteristic.
, This column will show the first two or, for some large log tables, three digits of the number whose logarithm you're looking up. If you're looking up the log of 15.27 in a normal log table, go to the row marked 15. If you're looking up the log of 2.57, go to the row marked 25.

 Sometimes the numbers in this row will have a decimal point, so you'll look up 2.5 rather than 25. You can ignore this decimal point, as it won't affect your answer.

 Also ignore any decimal points in the number whose logarithm you're looking up, as the mantissa for the log of 1.527 is no different from that of the log of 152.7. 


, This column will be the one marked with the next digit of the number whose logarithm you're looking up. For example, if you want to find the log of 15.27, your finger will be on the row marked 15. Slide your finger along that row to the right to find column 2. You will be pointing at the number 1818. Write this down.
, For 15.27, this number is 7. Your finger is currently on row 15 and column 2. Slide it over to row 15 and mean differences column 7. You will be pointing at the number 20. Write this down.
, For 15.27, you will get 1838. This is the mantissa of the logarithm of 15.27.
, Since 15 is between 10 and 100 (101 and 102), the log of 15 must be between 1 and 2, so 1.something, so the characteristic is 1. Combine the characteristic with the mantissa to get your final answer. Find that the log of 15.27 is 1.1838.
"
"
Understand the anti-log table.,
Write down the characteristic.,
Find the row that matches the first part of the mantissa.,
Slide your finger over to the column marked with the next digit of the mantissa.,
If your anti-log table has a table of mean differences, slide your finger over to the column in that table marked with the next digit of the mantissa.,
Add the two numbers from the two previous steps.,
Use the characteristic to place the decimal point.",How to Use Logarithmic Tables3," Use this when you have the log of a number but not the number itself. In the formula 10n = x, n is the common log, or base-ten log, of x. If you have x, find n using the log table. If you have n, find x using the anti-log table.

 The anti-log is also commonly known as the inverse log. 


, This is the number before the decimal point. If you're looking up the anti-log of 2.8699, the characteristic is 2. Mentally remove it from the number you're looking up, but make sure to write it down so you don't forget it - it will be important later.
, In 2.8699, the mantissa is .8699. Most anti-log tables, like most log tables, have two digits in the leftmost column, so run your finger down that column until you find .86.
, For 2.8699, slide your finger along the row marked .86 to find the intersection with column 9. This should read 7396. Write this down.
, Make sure to keep your finger in the same row. In this case, you will slide your finger over to the last column in the table, column 9. The intersection of row .86 and mean differences column 9 is 15. Write that down.
, In our example, these are 7396 and 15. Add them together to get 7411.
, Our characteristic was 2. This means that the answer is between 102 and 103, or between 100 and 1000. In order for the number 7411 to fall between 100 and 1000, the decimal point must go after three digits, so that the number is about 700 rather than 70, which is too small, or 7000, which is too big. So the final answer is 741.1.

Understand how to multiply numbers using their logarithms.,
Look up the logarithms of the two numbers you want to multiply.,
Add the two logarithms to find the logarithm of the solution.,
Look up the anti-logarithm of the result from the above step to find the solution.",How to Use Logarithmic Tables4," We know that 10 * 100 = 1000. Written in terms of powers (or logarithms), 101 * 102 = 103. We also know that 1 + 2 = 3. In general, 10x * 10y = 10x + y. So, the sum of the logarithms of two different numbers is the logarithm of the product of those numbers. We can multiply two numbers of the same base by adding their powers.
, Use the method above to find the logarithms. For example, if you want to multiply 15.27 and 48.54, you would find the log of 15.27 to be 1.1838 and the log of 48.54 to be 1.6861.
, In this example, add 1.1838 and 1.6861 to get 2.8699. This number is the logarithm of your answer.
, You can do this by finding the number in the body of the table closest to the mantissa of this number (8699). The more efficient and reliable method, however, is to find the answer in the table of anti-logarithms, as described in the method above. For this example, you will get 741.1.

Hold up your hands.,
Identify the factor you are multiplying by 9.,
Look at the number of fingers on the left.,
Look at the number of fingers on the right.",How to Multiply by 9's in Your Head2," Face your palms away from you, and spread out all ten of your fingers. Note that this method only works when you are multiplying 9 by a number between 1 and 10.
, Beginning on the left, count your fingers until you reach that digit. Put down that finger.

For example, if you are multiplying 9×6{\displaystyle 9\times 6}, you would put down the thumb of your right hand.


, You are looking at all the fingers to the left of the finger you put down. This number of fingers tells you the digit in the tens place of your product.For example, you have 5 fingers to the left of the thumb you put down. That means the tens digit of your product is 5.


, You are looking at all the fingers to the right of the finger you put down. This number of fingers tells you the digit in the ones place of your product.For example, you have 4 fingers to the right of the thumb you put down. That means the ones digit of your product is 4. So, 9×6=54{\displaystyle 9\times 6=54}.


"
"
Notice that the product’s digits add up to 9.,
Identify the pattern in the 9 x 10 times table.,
Use the formula 9×a=bc{\displaystyle 9\times a=bc}.",How to Multiply by 9's in Your Head3," This is true of the product of any number and 9. Knowing this can help you check your work as you multiply in your head.For example:9×2=81{\displaystyle 9\times 2=81}; 8+1=9{\displaystyle 8+1=9}9×5=45{\displaystyle 9\times 5=45}; 4+5=9{\displaystyle 4+5=9}9×12=108{\displaystyle 9\times 12=108}; 1+0+8=9{\displaystyle 1+0+8=9}


, Notice that the tens digit starts at 0 and goes up to 9. The ones digit works in reverse, starting with 9 and moving down to 0.For example:9×1=09{\displaystyle 9\times 1=09}9×2=18{\displaystyle 9\times 2=18}9×3=27{\displaystyle 9\times 3=27}9×4=36{\displaystyle 9\times 4=36}9×5=45{\displaystyle 9\times 5=45}9×6=54{\displaystyle 9\times 6=54}9×7=63{\displaystyle 9\times 7=63}9×8=72{\displaystyle 9\times 8=72}9×9=81{\displaystyle 9\times 9=81}9×10=90{\displaystyle 9\times 10=90}
, In this formula b=a−1{\displaystyle b=a-1} and c=9−b{\displaystyle c=9-b}. The expression bc{\displaystyle bc} does not indicate multiplication in this formula; rather, b{\displaystyle b} equals the tens digit in the product, and c{\displaystyle c} equals the ones digit in the productIn other words, to find the tens digit of the product, subtract 1 from the number you are multiplying by 9. Then, subtract that difference from 9 to find the ones digit. Note that this method only works when multiplying a single-digit number by 9.

For example, to calculate 9×7{\displaystyle 9\times 7}, you would first find:b=a−1{\displaystyle b=a-1}b=7−1=6{\displaystyle b=7-1=6}Thus, 6 is the product’s tens digit.Second, you would find:c=9−b{\displaystyle c=9-b}c=9−6=3{\displaystyle c=9-6=3}Thus, 3 is the product’s ones digit. So, 9×7=63{\displaystyle 9\times 7=63}

Count the number of negative signs in your multiplication problem.,
Decide the sign of your answer based on the number of negative signs in the problem.,
Multiply numbers from 1 - 10 using basic times table knowledge.,
If necessary, break larger numbers into manageable chunks.,
For more difficult numbers, use long multiplication.",How to Multiply and Divide Integers2," A basic multiplication problem between two or more positive numbers will always result in a positive answer. However, each negative sign added to a multiplication problem flips the sign from positive to negative or vice versa. To begin an integer multiplication problem, count the number of negative signs in the problem.


Let's use the example problem -10 × 5 × -11 × -20. In this problem, we can clearly see three negative signs. We'll use this information in the next step.;
, As noted above, the answer to a multiplication problem involving only positive integers will be positive. For each negative negative sign in your problem, flip the sign of your answer. In other words, if your problem has one negative sign, your answer will be negative; if it has two, your answer will be positive, and so on. A good rule of thumb is that odd numbers of negative signs give negative answers and even numbers of negative signs give positive answers.


In our example, we have three negative signs. Three is an odd number, so we know our answer is negative. We can put a negative sign in the space for our answer, like this: -10 × 5 × -11 × -20 = -__


, The product of any two numbers lesser than or equal to 10 is covered in basic times tables (see above). For these simple cases, just write the answer. Remember that, in problems that only use multiplication signs, you can move the integers around so that you're able to multiply simple numbers with each other.


In our example, 10 × 5 is covered in the basic times table. We don't have to account for the negative sign on the ten because we've already found the sign of our answer. 10 × 5 = 50. We can insert this into our problem like this: (50) × -11 × -20 = -__

If you're having difficulty visualizing basic multiplication problems, think of them in terms of addition problems. For instance, 5 × 10 is like saying ""five, ten times."" In other words, 5 × 10 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5.



, If your multiplication problem involves numbers greater than ten, you don't necessarily have to use long multiplication. First, see if you can break one or more of your numbers down into smaller, more workable pieces. Since, with basic times table knowledge, you can solve simple multiplication problems almost instantly, breaking a difficult problem into several of these easy problems is usually simpler than solving the single difficult problem.


Let's look at the second half of our example problem, -11 × -20. We can omit the signs because we've already figured out the sign of our answer. 11 × 20 looks intimidating, but if we rewrite the problem as 10 × 20 + 1 × 20, suddenly, it's much more manageable. 10 × 20 is just 2 times 10 × 10, or 200. 1 × 20 is just 20. Adding up our answers, we get 200 + 20 = 220. We can re-insert this into our problem as follows: (50) × (220) = -__


, If your multiplication problem involves two or more numbers greater than 10 and you're not able to find the answer by dividing your problem into workable chunks, you can still solve via long multiplication. In long multiplication, you line your answers up as you would in an addition problem and multiply each digit in the bottom number by each digit in the top number. If the bottom number has more than one digit, you'll need to account for digits in the tens, hundreds, and so on place by adding zeroes to the right side of your partial answer. Finally, to get your final answer, add up all the partial answers.


Let's return to our example problem. Now, we must multiply 50 by 220. This will be difficult to break into easier chunks, so let's use long multiplication. Long multiplication problems are easier to keep track of if the smaller number is on the bottom, so let's write our problem with 220 on top and 50 on the bottom.

First multiply the digit in the ones place of the bottom number by each digit of the top number. Since 50 is on the bottom, 0 is the digit in the ones place. 0 × 0 is 0, 0 × 2 is 0, and 0 × 2 is zero. In other words, 0 × 220 is zero. Write this below your long multiplication problem in the ones place. This is our first partial answer.
Next, we'll multiply the digit in the tens place of our bottom number by each digit of the top number. 5 is the digit in the tens place of 50. Since this 5 is in the tens place, rather than the ones place, we write a zero below our first partial answer in the ones place before proceeding. Next, we multiply. 5 × 0 is 0. 5 × 2 is 10, so write 0 and add one to the product of 5 and the next digit. 5 × 2 is 10. Normally, we would write 0 and carry the 1, but in this case we also add the 1 from the previous problem, giving us 11. Write down ""1"". Carrying the 1 from the tens place of 11, we see that we're out of digits, so we just write it to the left of our partial answer so far. Recording all this, we're left with 11,000.
Next, we just add. 0 + 11,000 is 11,000. Since we know the answer to our original problem is negative, we can safely say that -10 × 5 × -11 × -20 = -11,000.

As before, decide the sign of your answer based on the number of negative signs in the problem.,
Make simple divisions using your multiplication knowledge.,
Use long division when necessary.",How to Multiply and Divide Integers3," Introducing division to a math problem doesn't change the rules regarding negative signs. If there are an odd number of negative signs, the answer is negative, while if there are an even number of negative signs (or none at all) the answer will be positive.


Let's use an example problem with both multiplication and division. In the problem -15 × 4 ÷ 2 × -9 ÷ -10, there are three negative signs, so the answer will be negative. As before, we can put a negative sign in the space for our answer, like this: -15 × 4 ÷ 2 × -9 ÷ -10 = -__


, Division can be thought of as multiplication done backwards. When you divide one number by another, you're asking in a roundabout way, ""how many times does the second number fit into the first?"" or, in other words, ""what do I need to multiply the second number by to get the first?"" See the basic 10 x 10 times table for reference - if you're asked to divide one of the answers in the times table by any number n from 1 - 10, you'll know that the answer is just the other number from 1 - 10 needed to multiply n to get it.


Let's look at our example problem. In -15 × 4 ÷ 2 × -9 ÷ -10, we see 4 ÷ 2. 4 is an answer in the times table - both 4 × 1 and 2 × 2 give 4 as an answer. Since we're being asked to divide 4 by 2, we know that we're basically solving the problem 2 × __ = 4. In the blank space, of course, we would write 2, so 4 ÷ 2 = 2. Let's rewrite our problem as -15 × (2) × -9 ÷ -10.

, As with multiplication, when you come across a division problem that's too difficult to work out mentally or with a times table, you have the option of solving with a long-form approach. In a long division problem, you write your two numbers in a special sideways L-shaped bracket, then divide digit-by-digit, shifting your partial answers to the right as you go to account for the decreasing value of the digits you're dividing - hundreds, then tens, then ones, and so on.


Let's use long division in our example problem. We can simplify -15 × (2) × -9 ÷ -10 to 270 ÷ -10. We'll ignore the signs as usual because we know the sign of our final answer. Write 10 to the left of the L-shaped bracket and write 270 underneath it.

We begin by dividing the first digit of the number under the bracket by the number to the side. The first digit is 2 and our number to the side is 10. Since 10 doesn't fit in two, we'll instead use the first two digits. 10 does fit in 27 - it fits in twice. Write ""2"" above the 7 under the bracket. 2 is the first digit in your answer.
Next, multiply the number to the left of the bracket by the digit you just discovered. 2 × 10 is 20. Write this under the first two digits of the number under the bracket - in this case, 2 and 7.
Subtract the numbers you just wrote. 27 minus 20 is 7. Write this at the bottom of your growing problem.
Drop down the next digit of the number under the bracket. This next digit of 270 is 0. Drop this down next to the 7 to make 70.
Divide your new number. Next, divide 10 into 70. 10 fits exactly 7 times into 70, so write at the top next to the 2. This is the second digit of your answer. Your final answer is 27.
Note that, in the event that 10 didn't divide evenly into our final number, we'd need to account for the amount of 10 that is left over - the remainder. For instance, if our final act was to divide 71, rather than 70, by 10, we would notice that 10 doesn't fit exactly in 71. It fits in 7 times, but there is 1 left over. In other words, we can fit seven 10s and an extra 1 in 71. We would write our answer, then, as ""27 remainder 1"" or ""27 r1"".

45=4∗4∗4∗4∗4{\displaystyle 4^{5}=4*4*4*4*4}


82=8∗8{\displaystyle 8^{2}=8*8}


Ten cubed =10∗10∗10{\displaystyle =10*10*10}, For example, with 45{\displaystyle 4^{5}}, you'd start with 4∗4∗4∗4∗4{\displaystyle 4*4*4*4*4} This looks daunting, but just take it one step at a time. Start by multiplying the first two fours. Then replace the two fours with the answer as shown here:


45=4∗4∗4∗4∗4{\displaystyle 4^{5}=4*4*4*4*4}


4∗4=16{\displaystyle 4*4=16}




45=16∗4∗4∗4{\displaystyle 4^{5}=16*4*4*4}


, Keep multiplying in the numbers to ""grow"" your exponent. Continuing our example, you would multiple 16 by the next 4, so that:


45=16∗4∗4∗4{\displaystyle 4^{5}=16*4*4*4}


16∗4=64{\displaystyle 16*4=64}




45=64∗4∗4{\displaystyle 4^{5}=64*4*4}


64∗4=256{\displaystyle 64*4=256}




45=256∗4{\displaystyle 4^{5}=256*4}


256∗4=1024{\displaystyle 256*4=1024}



As shown, you continue multiplying the base by your product of each first pair of numbers until you get your final answer. Simply keep multiplying the first two numbers, then multiply the answer by the next number in the sequence. This works for any exponent. Once you're done with our example, you should get 45=4∗4∗4∗4∗4=1024{\displaystyle 4^{5}=4*4*4*4*4=1024}.

82{\displaystyle 8^{2}}


34{\displaystyle 3^{4}}


107{\displaystyle 10^{7}}


, It is almost impossible to do larger exponents, like 915{\displaystyle 9^{15}} by hand, but calculators can handle it with ease. The button is usually clearly labeled.

The denominator of the fraction will be the place value. The digits of the decimal will equal the numerator.For example, for the exponential expression 810.75{\displaystyle 81^{0.75}}, you need to convert 0.75{\displaystyle 0.75} to a fraction. Since the decimal goes to the hundredths place, the corresponding fraction is 75100{\displaystyle {\frac {75}{100}}}.
;
, Since you will be taking a root corresponding to the denominator of the exponent’s fraction, you want the denominator to be as small as possible. Do this by  simplifying the fraction. If your fraction is a mixed number (that is, if your exponent was a decimal greater than 1), rewrite it as an improper fraction.

For example, the fraction 75100{\displaystyle {\frac {75}{100}}} reduces to 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, So, 810.75=8134{\displaystyle 81^{0.75}=81^{\frac {3}{4}}}


, To do this, turn the numerator into a whole number, and multiply it by the unit fraction. The unit fraction is the fraction with the same denominator, but with 1 as the numerator.

For example, since 34=14×3{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}={\frac {1}{4}}\times 3}, you can rewrite the exponential expression as 8114×3{\displaystyle 81^{{\frac {1}{4}}\times 3}}.


, Remember that multiplying two exponents is like taking the power of a power. So x1b×a{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{b}}\times a} becomes (x1b)a{\displaystyle (x^{\frac {1}{b}})^{a}}.For example, 8114×3=(8114)3{\displaystyle 81^{{\frac {1}{4}}\times 3}=(81^{\frac {1}{4}})^{3}}.


, Taking a number by a rational exponent is equal to taking the appropriate root of the number. So, rewrite the base and its first exponent as a radical expression.

For example, since 8114=814{\displaystyle 81^{\frac {1}{4}}={\sqrt{81}}}, you can rewrite the expression as (814)3{\displaystyle ({\sqrt{81}})^{3}}., Remember that the index (the small number outside the radical sign) tells you which root you are looking for.  If the numbers are cumbersome, the best way to do this is using the yx{\displaystyle {\sqrt{y}}} feature on a scientific calculator.

For example, to calculate 814{\displaystyle {\sqrt{81}}}, you need to determine which number multiplied 4 times is equal to 81. Since 3×3×3×3=81{\displaystyle 3\times 3\times 3\times 3=81}, you know that 814=3{\displaystyle {\sqrt{81}}=3}. So, the exponential expression now becomes 33{\displaystyle 3^{3}}.


, You should now have a whole number as an exponent, so calculating should be straightforward. You can always use a calculator if the numbers are too large.

For example, 33=3×3×3=27{\displaystyle 3^{3}=3\times 3\times 3=27}. So, 810.75=27{\displaystyle 81^{0.75}=27}.


,, Since 2.25{\displaystyle 2.25} is greater than 1, the fraction will be a mixed number.

The decimal 0.25{\displaystyle 0.25} is equal to 25100{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{100}}}, so 2.25=225100{\displaystyle 2.25=2{\frac {25}{100}}}.


, You should also convert any mixed numbers to  improper fractions.

Since 25100{\displaystyle {\frac {25}{100}}} reduces to 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, 225100=214{\displaystyle 2{\frac {25}{100}}=2{\frac {1}{4}}}. 

Converting to an improper fraction, you have 94{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{4}}}. So, 2562.25=25694{\displaystyle 256^{2.25}=256^{\frac {9}{4}}}.


, Since 94=14×9{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{4}}={\frac {1}{4}}\times 9}, you can rewrite the expression as 25614×9{\displaystyle 256^{{\frac {1}{4}}\times 9}}.
, So, 25614×9=(25614)9{\displaystyle 256^{{\frac {1}{4}}\times 9}=(256^{\frac {1}{4}})^{9}}.
, 25614=2564{\displaystyle 256^{\frac {1}{4}}={\sqrt{256}}}, so you can rewrite the expression as (2564)9{\displaystyle ({\sqrt{256}})^{9}}.
, 2564=4{\displaystyle {\sqrt{256}}=4}. So, the expression is now (4)9{\displaystyle (4)^{9}}.
, (4)9=4×4×4×4×4×4×4×4×4=262,144{\displaystyle (4)^{9}=4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4=262,144}. So, 2562.25=262,144{\displaystyle 256^{2.25}=262,144}.
, An exponential expression has a base and an exponent. The base is the large number in the expression. The exponent is the smaller number.For example, in the expression 34{\displaystyle 3^{4}}, 3{\displaystyle 3} is the base and 4{\displaystyle 4} is the exponent.


, The base is the number that is being multiplied. The exponent tells you how many times the exponent is being multiplied.For example, 34=3×3×3×3=81{\displaystyle 3^{4}=3\times 3\times 3\times 3=81}.


, A rational exponent is also called a fractional exponent. It is an exponent that takes the form of a fraction.For example, 412{\displaystyle 4^{\frac {1}{2}}}.


, Taking a number to the 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} power is like taking the square root of the number. So, x12=x{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{2}}={\sqrt {x}}}. The same is true for other roots and exponents. The denominator of the exponent will tell you which root to take:x13=x3{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{3}}={\sqrt{x}}}


x14=x4{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{4}}={\sqrt{x}}}


x15=x5{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{5}}={\sqrt{x}}}

For example, 8114=814=3{\displaystyle 81^{\frac {1}{4}}={\sqrt{81}}=3}. You know that 3 is the fourth root of 81 since 3×3×3×3=81{\displaystyle 3\times 3\times 3\times 3=81}


, This law says that (xa)b=xab{\displaystyle (x^{a})^{b}=x^{ab}}. In other words taking an exponent to another power is the same as multiplying the two exponents.When working with rational exponents, this law looks like xab=(x1b)a{\displaystyle x^{\frac {a}{b}}=(x^{\frac {1}{b}})^{a}}, since 1b×a=ab{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{b}}\times a={\frac {a}{b}}}."

Multiply integers together if there are more than one.,
Write ""cannot be simplified"" if there are no two identical factors.",How to Simplify a Square Root1," The goal of simplifying a square root is to rewrite it in a form that is easy to understand and to use in math problems. Factoring breaks down a large number into two or more smaller factors, for instance turning 9 into 3 x 3. Once we find these factors, we can rewrite the square root in simpler form, sometimes even turning it into a normal integer. For example, √9 = √(3x3) = 3. Follow the steps below to learn this process for more complicated square roots.;
, If the number under the square root is even, divide it by 2. If your number is odd, try dividing it by 3 instead. If neither of these gives you a whole number, move down this list, testing the other primes until you get a whole number result. You only need to test the prime numbers, since all other numbers have prime numbers as their factors. For example, you don't need to test 4, because any number divisible by 4 is also divisible by 2, which you already tried.

, Keep everything underneath the square root sign, and don't forget to include both factors. For example, if you're trying to simplify √98, follow the step above to discover that 98 ÷ 2 = 49, so 98 = 2 x 49. Rewrite the ""98"" in the original square root using this information: √98 = √(2 x 49).

, Before we can simplify the square root, we keep factoring it until we've broken it down into two identical parts. This makes sense if you think about what a square root means: the term √(2 x 2) means ""the number you can multiply with itself to equal 2 x 2."" Obviously, this number is 2! With this goal in mind, let's repeat the steps above for our example problem, √(2 x 49):


2 is already factored as low as it will go. (In other words, it's one of those prime numbers on the list above.) We'll ignore this for now and try to divide 49 instead.
49 can't be evenly divided by 2, or by 3, or by 5. You can test this yourself using a calculator or long division. Because these don't give us nice, whole number results, we'll ignore them and keep trying.
49 can be evenly divided by seven. 49 ÷ 7 = 7, so 49 = 7 x 7.
Rewrite the problem: √(2 x 49) = √(2 x 7 x 7).

, Once you've broken the problem down into two identical factors, you can turn that into a regular integer outside the square root. Leave all other factors inside the square root. For example, √(2 x 7 x 7) = √(2)√(7 x 7) = √(2) x 7 = 7√(2).


Even if it's possible to keep factoring, you don't need to once you've found two identical factors. For example, √(16) = √(4 x 4) = 4. If we kept on factoring, we'd end up with the same answer but have to do more work: √(16) = √(4 x 4) = √(2 x 2 x 2 x 2) = √(2 x 2)√(2 x 2) = 2 x 2 = 4.

, With some large square roots, you can simplify more than once. If this happens, multiply the integers together to get your final problem. Here's an example:


√180 = √(2 x 90)
√180 = √(2 x 2 x 45)
√180 = 2√45, but this can still be simplified further.
√180 = 2√(3 x 15)
√180 = 2√(3 x 3 x 5)
√180 = (2)(3√5)
√180 = 6√5

, Some square roots are already in simplest form. If you keep factoring until every term under the square root is a prime number (listed in one of the steps above), and no two are the same, then there's nothing you can do. You might have been given a trick question! For example, let's try to simplify √70:


70 = 35 x 2, so √70 = √(35 x 2)
35 = 7 x 5, so √(35 x 2) = √(7 x 5 x 2)
All three of these numbers are prime, so they cannot be factored further. They're all different, so there's no way to ""pull out"" an integer. √70 cannot be simplified.

Make sure the exponents have the same base.,
Add the exponents together.,
Calculate the expression.",How to Multiply Exponents1," The base is the large number in the exponential expression. You can only use this method if the expressions you are multiplying have the same base.

For example, you can use this method to multiply 52×53{\displaystyle 5^{2}\times 5^{3}}, because they both have the same base (5). On the other hand, you cannot use this method to multiply 52×23{\displaystyle 5^{2}\times 2^{3}}, because they have different bases (5 and 2).
;
, Rewrite the expression, keeping the same base but putting the sum of the original exponents as the new exponent.For example, if you are multiplying 52×53{\displaystyle 5^{2}\times 5^{3}}, you would keep the base of 5, and add the exponents together:52×53{\displaystyle 5^{2}\times 5^{3}}=52+3{\displaystyle =5^{2+3}}=55{\displaystyle =5^{5}}


, An exponent tells you how many times to multiply a number by itself.You can use a calculator to easily calculate an exponential expression, but you can also calculate by hand.

For example 55=5×5×5×5×5{\displaystyle 5^{5}=5\times 5\times 5\times 5\times 5}55=3,125{\displaystyle 5^{5}=3,125}So, 52×53=3,125{\displaystyle 5^{2}\times 5^{3}=3,125}

y = logb (x)

If and only if: by = x



Note that b is the base of the logarithm. It must also be true that:

b > 0
b does not equal 1


In the same equation, y is the exponent and x is the exponential expression that the logarithm is set equal to.

, When looking at the problem equation, identify the base (b), exponent (y), and exponential expression (x).



Example: 5 = log4(1024)

b = 4
y = 5
x = 1024



, Set the value of your exponential expression, x, to one side of the equal sign.



Example: 1024 = ?

, The value of your base, b, needs to be multiplied by itself by the amount of times indicated by your exponent, y.



Example: 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = ?

This could also be written as: 45




, You should be able to rewrite the logarithm as an exponential expression now. Verify that your answer is correct by making sure that both sides of the equation are equal.



Example: 45 = 1024

Add or subtract exponents only if they have the same base and exponent.,
Multiply numbers with the same base by adding the exponents together.,
Multiply an exponential number that is raised to another power, like (x2)5{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{5}}.,
Treat negative exponents like fractions, or the number's reciprocal.,
Divide two numbers with the same base by subtracting the exponents.,
Try out some practice problems to get use to manipulating exponential numbers.",How to Solve Exponents2," If you have identical bases and exponents, such as 45+45{\displaystyle 4^{5}+4^{5}}, you can simplify the addition of terms into simply a multiplication problem. Remember that 45{\displaystyle 4^{5}} can be thought of as 1∗45{\displaystyle 1*4^{5}} so that 45+45=1∗45+1∗45=2∗45{\displaystyle 4^{5}+4^{5}=1*4^{5}+1*4^{5}=2*4^{5}} by adding, where ""1 of that plus 1 of that = 2 of that"", whatever ""that"" may be. Just add the number of similar terms (with the identical base and exponent) together and multiply the sum by that exponential expression. You can then simply solve 45{\displaystyle 4^{5}} and multiply that answer by two. Remember, this is because multiplication is just a way to rewrite addition, since 3+3=2∗3{\displaystyle 3+3=2*3}. Check out some examples:32+32=2∗32{\displaystyle 3^{2}+3^{2}=2*3^{2}}


45+45+45=3∗45{\displaystyle 4^{5}+4^{5}+4^{5}=3*4^{5}}


45−45+2=2{\displaystyle 4^{5}-4^{5}+2=2}


4x2−2x2=2x2{\displaystyle 4x^{2}-2x^{2}=2x^{2}}


, If you have two exponents with the same bass, such as x2∗x5{\displaystyle x^{2}*x^{5}}, all you have to do is add the two exponents together with the same base. Thus,  x2∗x5=x7{\displaystyle x^{2}*x^{5}=x^{7}}. If you're confused, just break it down into all of it's parts to figure out the system:


x2∗x5{\displaystyle x^{2}*x^{5}} 


x2=x∗x{\displaystyle x^{2}=x*x}


x5=x∗x∗x∗x∗x{\displaystyle x^{5}=x*x*x*x*x}


x2∗x5=(x∗x)∗(x∗x∗x∗x∗x){\displaystyle x^{2}*x^{5}=(x*x)*(x*x*x*x*x)}

Since everything is just the same number multiplied, we can combine them: x2∗x5=x∗x∗x∗x∗x∗x∗x{\displaystyle x^{2}*x^{5}=x*x*x*x*x*x*x}


x2∗x5=x7{\displaystyle x^{2}*x^{5}=x^{7}}, If you have an number raised to a power, and the whole thing is then raised to a power, simply multiply the two exponents. So (x2)5=x2∗5=x10{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{5}=x^{2*5}=x^{10}}. Again, think of what these symbols actually mean if you get confused. (x2)5{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{5}} just means you are multiplying (x2){\displaystyle (x^{2})} by itself 5 times, so:


(x2)5{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{5}}


(x2)5=x2∗x2∗x2∗x2∗x2{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{5}=x^{2}*x^{2}*x^{2}*x^{2}*x^{2}}

Since the base bases are the same, you can simply add them together: (x2)5=x2∗x2∗x2∗x2∗x2=x10{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{5}=x^{2}*x^{2}*x^{2}*x^{2}*x^{2}=x^{10}}


, If you don't know what reciprocals are, it is okay. If you have a negative exponent, like 3−2{\displaystyle 3^{-}2}, simply make the exponent positive and put it under one, ending up with 132{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{3^{2}}}}. Check out a few more examples:


5−101510{\displaystyle 5^{-10}{\frac {1}{5^{10}}}}


3x−4=3x4{\displaystyle 3x^{-}4={\frac {3}{x^{4}}}}, Division is the opposite of multiplication, and while they aren't always solved exactly opposite, they are here. If you have the equation 4442{\displaystyle {\frac {4^{4}}{4^{2}}}}, simply subtract the top exponent by the bottom and leave the base the same. Thus, 4442=44−2=42{\displaystyle {\frac {4^{4}}{4^{2}}}=4^{4-2}=4^{2}}, or 16.

As you'll soon see, any number that is part of a fraction, like 142{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4^{2}}}}, can actually be rewritten as 4−2{\displaystyle 4^{-2}}. Negative exponents create fractions.


, The following problems cover everything currently shown. To see the answer, simply highlight the entire line the problem is on.


53{\displaystyle 5^{3}} = 125


22+22+22{\displaystyle 2^{2}+2^{2}+2^{2}} = 12

Treat fractional exponents, like x12{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{2}}} like a square root problem.,
Turn the top number into a normal exponent for mixed fractions.x53{\displaystyle x^{\frac {5}{3}}} might look impossible, but it is easy if you remember how exponents are multiplied.,
Add, subtract, and multiply fractional exponents just like normal.,
Convert tricky roots into fractional exponents to help solve them.",How to Solve Exponents3," x12{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{2}}} is actually the exact same thing as x{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}}. This is done similarly no matter what the bottom of the fraction is, so x14{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{4}}} would be the 4th root of x, also written as x4{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}} .

Roots are the inverse of exponents. For example, if you took the answer to x4{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}} raised it to the fourth power, you would be back at x{\displaystyle x}, such as 164=2{\displaystyle {\sqrt{16}}=2} can be checked as 24=16{\displaystyle 2^{4}=16}. Also for example, if x4=2{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}=2} then 24=x{\displaystyle 2^{4}=x} therefore x=2{\displaystyle x=2} ., Simply turn the base into a root, like a normal fraction, then raise the whole thing to the power on the top of the fraction. If you're struggling to remember this, think through the theory. After all, 53{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{3}}} really just equals (13)∗5{\displaystyle ({\frac {1}{3}})*5} For example:


x53{\displaystyle x^{\frac {5}{3}}}


x53=x5∗x13{\displaystyle x^{\frac {5}{3}}=x^{5}*x^{\frac {1}{3}}}


x13=x3{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{3}}={\sqrt{x}}}


x53=x5∗x13{\displaystyle x^{\frac {5}{3}}=x^{5}*x^{\frac {1}{3}}} = (x3)5{\displaystyle ({\sqrt{x}})^{5}}


, It is much easier to try and add and subtract your exponents before solving them or turning them into roots. If the base is the same and the exponent identical, you can add and subtract like normal. If the base is the same, you can multiply and divide the exponents like normal as well, as long as your remember how to add and subtract fractions. For example:


x53+x53=2(x53){\displaystyle x^{\frac {5}{3}}+x^{\frac {5}{3}}=2(x^{\frac {5}{3}})}


x53∗x23=x73{\displaystyle x^{\frac {5}{3}}*x^{\frac {2}{3}}=x^{\frac {7}{3}}}, You've seen how a fractional exponent easily becomes a root. It should be noted, however, that the process can be reversed as well. Take the example x5+x75{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}+x^{\frac {7}{5}}}. This problem may look impossible at first glance, but that root in the first term can easily be made a fraction, allowing you to solve the problem:x5+x75{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}+x^{\frac {7}{5}}}


x5=x15{\displaystyle {\sqrt{x}}=x^{\frac {1}{5}}}


x15+x75{\displaystyle x^{\frac {1}{5}}+x^{\frac {7}{5}}}

Memorize a few perfect squares.,
Find the square root of a perfect square.,
Factor numbers into perfect squares.,
Factor a number with more than one perfect square.",How to Simplify a Square Root2," Squaring a number, or multiplying it by itself, creates a perfect square. For example, 25 is a perfect square because 5 x 5, or 52, equals 25. Memorizing at least the first ten perfect squares can help you recognize and quickly simplify perfect square roots. Here are the first ten perfect squares:


12 = 1
22 = 4
32 = 9
42 = 16
52 = 25
62 = 36
72 = 49
82 = 64
92 = 81
102 = 100

, If you recognize a perfect square under a square root symbol, you can immediately turn it into its square root and get rid of the radical sign (√). For example, if you see the number 25 under the square root sign, you know that the answer is 5 because 25 is a perfect square. Here's the same list as above, going from the square root to the answer:


√1 = 1
√4 = 2
√9 = 3
√16 = 4
√25 = 5
√36 = 6
√49 = 7
√64 = 8
√81 = 9
√100 = 10

, Use the perfect squares to your advantage when following the factor method of simplifying square roots. If you notice a way to factor out a perfect square, it can save you time and effort. Here are some tips:


√50 = √(25 x 2) = 5√2. If the last two digits of a number end in 25, 50, or 75, you can always factor out 25.
√1700 = √(100 x 17) = 10√17. If the last two digits end in 00, you can always factor out 100.
√72 = √(9 x 8) = 3√8. Recognizing multiples of nine is often helpful. There's a trick to it: if all digits in a number add up to nine, then nine is always a factor.
√12 = √(4 x 3) = 2√3. There's no special trick here, but it's usually easy to check whether a small number is divisible by 4. Keep this in mind when looking for factors.

, If the number's factors contain more than one perfect square, move them all outside the radical symbol. If you found multiple perfect squares during your simplification process, move all of their square roots to the outside of the √ symbol and multiply them together. For example, let's simplify √72:


√72 = √(9 x 8)
√72 = √(9 x 4 x 2)
√72 = √(9) x √(4) x √(2)
√72 = 3 x 2 x √2
√72 = 6√2

Understand the meaning of simplifying a square root.",How to Simplify a Square Root3," For example, in the problem, √25, ""√"" is the radical symbol.

, You will need to find the square root of this number. For example, in the problem √25, ""25"" is the radicand.

, This is the number that the square root is being multiplied by; this sits to the left of the √ symbol. For example, in the problem, 7√2, ""7"" is the coefficient.

, For example, 2 is a factor of 8 because 8 ÷ 4 = 2, but 3 is not a factor of 8 because 8÷3 doesn’t result in a whole number. As another example, 5 is a factor of 25 because 5 x 5 = 25.

, Simplifying a square root just means factoring out any perfect squares from the radicand, moving them to the left of the radical symbol, and leaving the other factor inside the radical symbol. If the number is a perfect square, then the radical sign will disappear once you write down its root. For example, √98 can be simplified to 7√2.

Calculate the first exponential expression.,
Calculate the second exponential expression.,
Rewrite the problem using the new calculations.,
Multiply the two numbers.",How to Multiply Exponents2," Since the exponents have different bases, there is no shortcut for multiplying them. Calculate the exponent using a calculator or by hand. Remember, an exponent tells you how many times to multiply a number by itself.

For example, if you are multiplying 23×45{\displaystyle 2^{3}\times 4^{5}}, you should note that they do not have the same base. So, you will first calculate 23=2×2×2=8{\displaystyle 2^{3}=2\times 2\times 2=8}.


, Do this by multiplying the base number by itself however many times the exponent says.

For example, 45=4×4×4×4×4=1024{\displaystyle 4^{5}=4\times 4\times 4\times 4\times 4=1024}


, Following the same example, your new problem becomes 8×1024{\displaystyle 8\times 1024}.
, This will give you the final answer to the problem.

For example: 8×1024=8192.{\displaystyle 8\times 1024=8192.} So, 23×45=8,192{\displaystyle 2^{3}\times 4^{5}=8,192}.

Multiply the coefficients.,
Add the exponents of the first variable.,
Add the exponents of the remaining variables.",How to Multiply Exponents3," Multiply these as you would any whole numbers. Move the number to the outside of the parentheses.For example, if multiplying (2x3y5)(8xy4){\displaystyle (2x^{3}y^{5})(8xy^{4})}, you would first calculate ((2)x3y5)((8)xy4)=16(x3y5)(xy4){\displaystyle ((2)x^{3}y^{5})((8)xy^{4})=16(x^{3}y^{5})(xy^{4})}.


, Make sure you are only adding the exponents of terms with the same base (variable). Don’t forget that if a variable shows no exponent, it is understood to have an exponent of 1.For example:16(x3y5)(xy4)=16(x3)y5(x)y4=16(x3+1)y5y4=16(x4)y5y4{\displaystyle 16(x^{3}y^{5})(xy^{4})=16(x^{3})y^{5}(x)y^{4}=16(x^{3+1})y^{5}y^{4}=16(x^{4})y^{5}y^{4}}


, Take care to add exponents with the same base, and don’t forget that variables with no exponents have an understood exponent of 1.

For example: 16(x4)y5y4=16x4y5+4=16x4y9{\displaystyle 16(x^{4})y^{5}y^{4}=16x^{4}y^{5+4}=16x^{4}y^{9}}

Isolate the logarithm.,
Rewrite the equation in exponential form.,
Solve for x.,
Write your final answer.",How to Solve Logarithms2," Use inverse operations to move any part of the equation that is not part of the logarithm to the opposite side of the equation.



Example: log3(x + 5) + 6 = 10

log3(x + 5) + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6
log3(x + 5) = 4

;
, Using what you now know about the relationship between logarithms and exponential equations, break the logarithm apart and rewrite the equation in a simpler, solvable exponential form.



Example:log3(x + 5) = 4

Comparing this equation to the definition , you can conclude that: y = 4; b = 3; x = x + 5
Rewrite the equation so that: by = x
34 = x + 5



, With the problem simplified into a basic exponential equation, you should be able to solve it as you would solve any exponential equation.



Example: 34 = x + 5

3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = x + 5
81 = x + 5
81 - 5 = x + 5 - 5
76 = x



, The answer you got when solving for x is the solution to your original logarithm.

Know the product rule.,
Isolate the logarithm to one side of the equation.,
Apply the product rule.,
Rewrite the equation in exponential form.,
Solve for x.,
Write your answer.",How to Solve Logarithms3," The first property of logarithms, known as the ""product rule,"" states that the logarithm of a multiplied product equals the sum of the logarithms of both factors. Written in equation form:


logb(m * n) = logb(m) + logb(n)
Also note that the following must be true:

m > 0
n > 0



, Use inverse operations to shift the parts of the equation around so that all logarithms are on one side of the equation while all other elements are on the opposite side.



Example: log4(x + 6) = 2 - log4(x)

log4(x + 6) + log4(x) = 2 - log4(x) + log4(x)
log4(x + 6) + log4(x) = 2



, If there are two logarithms added together in the equation, you can use the product rule to combine the two logarithms into one.



Example: log4(x + 6) + log4(x) = 2

log4= 2
log4(x2 + 6x) = 2



, Remember that a logarithm is just another way to write an exponential equation. Use the logarithm definition to rewrite the equation in its solvable form.



Example: log4(x2 + 6x) = 2

Comparing this equation to the definition , you can conclude that: y = 2; b = 4 ; x = x2 + 6x
Rewrite the equation so that: by = x
42 = x2 + 6x



, Now that the equation has become a standard exponential equation, use your knowledge of exponential equations to solve for x as you usually would.



Example: 42 = x2 + 6x

4 * 4 = x2 + 6x
16 = x2 + 6x
16 - 16 = x2 + 6x - 16
0 = x2 + 6x - 16
0 = (x - 2) * (x + 8)
x = 2; x = -8



, At this point, you should have the solution for the equation. Write it down in the space provided for your answer.



Example: x = 2
Note that you cannot have a negative solution for a logarithm, so you can discard x - 8 as a solution.

Know the quotient rule.,
Isolate the logarithm to one side of the equation.,
Apply the quotient rule.,
Rewrite the equation in exponential form.,
Solve for x.,
Write your final answer.",How to Solve Logarithms4," According to the second property of logarithms, known as the ""quotient rule,"" the logarithm of a quotient can be rewritten by subtracting the logarithm of the denominator from the logarithm of the numerator. Written as an equation:


logb(m / n) = logb(m) - logb(n)
Also note that the following must be true:

m > 0
n > 0



, Before you can solve the logarithm, you need to shift all logs in the equation to one side of the equal sign. The other parts of the equation should all be shifted to the opposite side of the equation. Use inverse operations to accomplish this.



Example: log3(x + 6) = 2 + log3(x - 2)

log3(x + 6) - log3(x - 2) = 2 + log3(x - 2) - log3(x - 2)
log3(x + 6) - log3(x - 2) = 2



, If there are two logarithms in the equation and one must be subtracted by the other, you can and should use the quotient rule to combine the two logarithms into one.



Example: log3(x + 6) - log3(x - 2) = 2

log3= 2



, Now that there is only one logarithm in the equation, use the logarithms definition to rewrite the equation in exponential form, thereby removing the log.



Example: log3= 2

Comparing this equation to the definition , you can conclude that: y = 2; b = 3; x = (x + 6) / (x - 2)
Rewrite the equation so that: by = x
32 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)



, With the equation now in exponential form, you should be able to solve for x as you usually would.



Example: 32 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)

3 * 3 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)
9 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)
9 * (x - 2) = * (x - 2)
9x - 18 = x + 6
9x - x - 18 + 18 = x - x + 6 + 18
8x = 24
8x / 8 = 24 / 8
x = 3



, Go back and double-check your steps. Once you feel certain that you have the correct solution, write it down.



Example: x = 3

Determine whether the two exponents have the same base.,
Ignore the base.,
Solve the equation.,
Check your work.",How to Solve Exponential Equations1," The base is the big number in an exponential expression.You can only use this method when you are presented with an equation that has an exponent on either side, and each exponent has the same base.

For example, 65+y=63{\displaystyle 6^{5+y}=6^{3}} has an exponent on either side of the equation, and each exponent has the same base (6).
;
, Since the exponents are equal and have the same base, their exponents must be equal. As such, you can ignore the base and write an equation for the exponents only.For example, in the equation 65+y=63{\displaystyle 6^{5+y}=6^{3}}, since both exponents have the same base, you would write an equation for the exponents: 5+y=3{\displaystyle 5+y=3}.


, To do this, you need to isolate the variable. Remember that whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side of the equation.

For example:5+y=3{\displaystyle 5+y=3}5+y−5=3−5{\displaystyle 5+y-5=3-5}y=−2{\displaystyle y=-2}


, To make sure that your answer is correct, plug the value you found for the variable back into the original equation, and simplify the expression. The two sides should be equal.

For example, if you found that y=−2{\displaystyle y=-2}, you would substitute −2{\displaystyle -2} for y{\displaystyle y} in the original equation:65+y=63{\displaystyle 6^{5+y}=6^{3}}65−2=63{\displaystyle 6^{5-2}=6^{3}}63=63{\displaystyle 6^{3}=6^{3}}

Figure out the perfect square root using multiplication.,
Use division to find the square root.,
Use the right symbols for square root.",How to Find a Square Root Without a Calculator1," The number’s square root is a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the first number. Another way of saying this is: “What can we multiply by itself to get the number in question?”


For example, the square root of 1 is 1 because 1 multiplied by 1 equals 1 (1X1=1). However, the square root of 4 is 2 because 2 multiplied by 2 equals 4 (2X2=4). Think of the square root concept by imagining a tree. A tree grows from an acorn. Thus, it’s bigger than but related to the acorn, which was at its root. In the above example, 4 is the tree, and 2 is the acorn.
Thus, the square root of 9 is 3 (3X3=9), of 16 is 4 (4X4=16), of 25 is 5 (5X5=25), of 36 is 6 (6X6=36), of 49 is 7 (7X7=49), or 64 is 8 (8X8=64), of 81 is 9 (9X9=81), and of 100 is 10 (10X10=100).;
, To find the square root of a whole number, you could also divide the whole number by numbers until you get an answer that is the same as the number you used to divide the whole number.


For example: 16 divided by 4 is 4. And 4 divided by 2 is 2, and so on. Thus, in those examples, 4 is the square root of 16, and 2 is the square root of 4.
Perfect square roots do not have fractions or decimals because they involve whole numbers.

, Mathematicians use a special symbol called the radical to indicate square root. It looks like a check mark with a line across the top going to the right.N equals the number whose square root you are trying to find. It goes inside the check mark symbol.Thus, if you are trying to find the square root of 9, you should write a formula that puts the ""N"" (9) inside the check mark symbol (the ""radical"") and then present an equal sign and the 3. This means the “square root of 9 equals 3.”

Solve expressions with a positive exponent.,

Simplify division expressions with a positive exponent.,
Simplify exponents with a positive exponent.,
Simplify expressions with a negative exponent.,
Address the order of operations.,
Simplify the expressions using the laws of exponents.,
Simplify coefficients.",How to Solve Algebraic Problems With Exponents," An exponent simply tells you how many times you multiply the base (big number) by itself. For example, x3{\displaystyle x^{3}} is the same as x×x×x{\displaystyle x\times x\times x}.

Plugging in a number, you would have23{\displaystyle 2^{3}}=2×2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 2}=8{\displaystyle 8}

Expressions to the first degree (expressions with an exponent of 1) always simplify to the base. It is like saying “x one time.” For example, x1=x{\displaystyle x^{1}=x}.

Expressions to the zero degree (expressions with an exponent of 0) always simplify to 1. For example, x0=1{\displaystyle x^{0}=1}.
;
, When you multiply two exponents with the same base, you can simplify the expression by adding the exponents. Do NOT add or multiply the base. This rule does not apply to numbers that have a different base. For example, you cannot simplify 23×32{\displaystyle 2^{3}\times 3^{2}}, you simply have to solve the exponents separately and then multiply the two numbers.

For example, x2×x4{\displaystyle x^{2}\times x^{4}} is the same as x2+4{\displaystyle x^{2+4}}, which is the same as x6{\displaystyle x^{6}}. 

Plugging in a number, you would have22×24{\displaystyle 2^{2}\times 2^{4}}=22+4{\displaystyle 2^{2+4}}=26{\displaystyle 2^{6}}=2×2×2×2×2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2}=64{\displaystyle 64}


, When you divide to exponents with the same base, you can simplify the expression by subtracting the exponents.Do NOT divide or subtract the base.

For example, x10x5{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{10}}{x^{5}}}} is the same as x10−5{\displaystyle x^{10-5}}, which is the same as x5{\displaystyle x^{5}}. 

Plugging in a number, you would have 21025{\displaystyle {\frac {2^{10}}{2^{5}}}}=210−5{\displaystyle 2^{10-5}}=25{\displaystyle 2^{5}}=2×2×2×2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2}=32{\displaystyle 32}


, Sometimes an exponent will have an exponent. In this situation, you would multiply the two exponents.For example, (x2)3{\displaystyle (x^{2})^{3}} is the same as x2×3{\displaystyle x^{2\times 3}}, which is the same as x6{\displaystyle x^{6}}.

Plugging in a number, you would have(22)3{\displaystyle (2^{2})^{3}}=22×3{\displaystyle 2^{2\times 3}}=26{\displaystyle 2^{6}}=2×2×2×2×2×2{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2}=64{\displaystyle 64}


, You can think of a negative exponent as being the opposite of a positive exponent. Since a positive exponent tells you how many times to multiply, a negative exponent tells you how many times to divide.To simplify an expression with a negative exponent, use the formula x−a=1xa{\displaystyle x^{-a}={\frac {1}{x^{a}}}}.

For example, x−4{\displaystyle x^{-4}} is the same as 1x4{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x^{4}}}}.

Plugging in a number,2−4{\displaystyle 2^{-4}}=124{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2^{4}}}}=12×2×2×2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\times 2\times 2\times 2}}}=116{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{16}}}


, Just like any problem in mathematics, an algebraic problem must be completed by the order of operations. You can use the phrase ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" or the acronym PEMDAS, to help you remember Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.For example, if the problem is 4(x10÷x4)÷2(x3×x2)−3x0{\displaystyle 4(x^{10}\div x^{4})\div 2(x^{3}\times x^{2})-3x^{0}}, you would first complete the calculations inside the parentheses.


, Remember, you can only simplify if the exponents have the same base.

For example, x10÷x4{\displaystyle x^{10}\div x^{4}} can simplify to x10−4{\displaystyle x^{10-4}}, or x6{\displaystyle x^{6}}. x3×x2{\displaystyle x^{3}\times x^{2}} can simplify to x3+2{\displaystyle x^{3+2}}, or x5{\displaystyle x^{5}}.x0{\displaystyle x^{0}} is 1, since any number to the zero power is 1. So, the simplified problem becomes 4(x6)÷2(x5)−3(1){\displaystyle 4(x^{6})\div 2(x^{5})-3(1)}.


, Coefficients are the numbers in an algebraic problem. When simplifying coefficients with exponents, you complete the regular operations.

For example, for 4(x6)÷2(x5){\displaystyle 4(x^{6})\div 2(x^{5})}, you would first divide the coefficients:4÷2=2{\displaystyle 4\div 2=2}. Then, divide the exponents:x6÷x5{\displaystyle x^{6}\div x^{5}}=x6−5{\displaystyle x^{6-5}}=x1{\displaystyle x^{1}}=x{\displaystyle x}. Since 3(1){\displaystyle 3(1)} simplifies to 3{\displaystyle 3}, the final, simplified problem is 2x−3{\displaystyle 2x-3}.

Write the equation for the exponents only.,
Solve for the variable.,
Check your work.",How to Solve Exponential Equations2," Make sure that there is an exponential expression on one side of the equation, and a whole number on the other side. If not, you need to rework the equation so that the exponent is alone on one side.

For example, if your are trying to solve 3x−5−2=79{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}-2=79}, you first need to isolate 3x−5{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}} by adding 2 to each side of the equation:3x−5−2=79{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}-2=79}3x−5−2+2=79+2{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}-2+2=79+2}3x−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=81}


, You need to determine whether the whole number can be converted to an exponent with the same base as the other exponent.If you can’t convert the whole number in this way, you cannot use this method.

For example, look at the equation 3x−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=81}. You need to change 81 to an exponent with a base of 3, so that it matches the other exponential expression in the equation. By factoring out 3, you should see that 3×3×3×3=81{\displaystyle 3\times 3\times 3\times 3=81}, so 34=81{\displaystyle 3^{4}=81}. The new equation then becomes 3x−5=34{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=3^{4}}.


, Since you converted the whole number, you now have two exponential expressions with the same base. Since the bases are the same, you can ignore them and focus on the exponents.

For example, since 3x−5=34{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=3^{4}} has two exponents with a base of 3, you can ignore the base and simply look at the equation x−5=4{\displaystyle x-5=4}.


, To do this, you need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Make sure that whatever you do to one side, you also do to the other side.

For example:x−5=4{\displaystyle x-5=4}x−5+5=4+5{\displaystyle x-5+5=4+5}x=9{\displaystyle x=9}


, You can see if your answer is correct by plugging the solution you found back into the original equation. After simplifying each expression, both sides of the equation should be equal. If they aren’t, you miscalculated and need to try again.

For example, if you found that x=9{\displaystyle x=9}, you would plug in 9{\displaystyle 9} for x{\displaystyle x} in the original equation and simplify:3x−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{x-5}=81}39−5=81{\displaystyle 3^{9-5}=81}34=81{\displaystyle 3^{4}=81}81=81{\displaystyle 81=81}

Isolate the variable.,
Find the logs in the equation.,
Complete the calculations.",How to Solve Exponential Equations3," One side of the equation should be the exponent, the other should be the whole number. If not, modify the equation so the exponent is alone on one side.

For example, you need to isolate the expression 43+x{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}} in the equation 43+x−8=17{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}-8=17} by adding 8 to both sides:43+x−8=17{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}-8=17}43+x−8+8=17+8{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}-8+8=17+8}43+x=25{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}=25}


, Set up the equation so that you are taking the log of both sides. A log is the inverse of an exponent.. You can find a base-10 log using most scientific calculators. For now, you are just rewriting the equation, indicating you are taking the log of each side.

For example, if you take the base-10 log of both sides of 43+x=25{\displaystyle 4^{3+x}=25}, you would rewrite the equation like this: log43+x=log25{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4^{3+x}={\text{log}}25}.


, Rewrite it using the rule logar=rloga{\displaystyle {\text{log}}a^{r}=r{\text{log}}a}. Rewriting the exponential expression this way will allow you to simplify and solve the equation. Do not calculate the logs yet.

For example, log43+x=log25{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4^{3+x}={\text{log}}25} can be rewritten as (3+x)log4=log25{\displaystyle (3+x){\text{log}}4={\text{log}}25}


, To solve, you need to rewrite the equation so that one side contains the variable, and the other side contains all of the numbers. You will need to divide each side of the equation by the log of the exponential expression. You will also need to add or subtract any constants to both sides, and perform any other necessary operations.

For example, to isolate the x{\displaystyle x} in (3+x)log4=log25{\displaystyle (3+x){\text{log}}4={\text{log}}25}, you first need to divide each side of the equation by log4{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4}, then subtract 3 from both sides:(3+x)log4=log25{\displaystyle (3+x){\text{log}}4={\text{log}}25}(3+x)log4log4=log25log4{\displaystyle (3+x){\frac {{\text{log}}4}{{\text{log}}4}}={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}}3+x=log25log4{\displaystyle 3+x={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}}3+x−3=log25log4−3{\displaystyle 3+x-3={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}-3}x=log25log4−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {{\text{log}}25}{{\text{log}}4}}-3}


, You can do this using a scientific calculator. Type the number you are finding the log of, then hit the LOG{\displaystyle {\text{LOG}}} button. Rewrite the equation using these new values for the logs.

For example, to find log25{\displaystyle {\text{log}}25}, hit 25{\displaystyle 25}, then LOG{\displaystyle {\text{LOG}}} on your calculator, to get about 1.3979. To find log4{\displaystyle {\text{log}}4}, hit 4{\displaystyle 4}, then LOG{\displaystyle {\text{LOG}}} on your calculator, to get about 0.602. You new equation will now be x=1.39790.602−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {1.3979}{0.602}}-3}.


, This will give you the value of the variable. Your answer will be approximate since you rounded when finding the logs. Remember to use the order of operations when making your calculations. For more instructions on how to calculate using the order of operations, read Evaluate an Expression Using PEMDAS.

For example, in x=1.39790.602−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {1.3979}{0.602}}-3} you should divide first, then subtract:x=1.39790.602−3{\displaystyle x={\frac {1.3979}{0.602}}-3}x=2.322−3{\displaystyle x=2.322-3}x=−0.678{\displaystyle x=-0.678}.

Take a guess at it, and use the process of elimination.,
Use a process of averaging.",How to Find a Square Root Without a Calculator2," It's tougher to figure out square roots of numbers that are not whole. But it's possible.


Let’s say you want to find the square root of 20. You know that 16 is a perfect whole number with a square root of 4 (4X4=16). And 25 similarly has a square root of 5 (5X5=25), so the square root of 20 must fall in between.
You could guess that 20’s square root is 4.5. Now, simply square 4.5 to check your guess. That means you multiply it by itself: 4.5X4.5. See if the answer is above or below 20. If the guess seems off, simply try another guess (maybe 4.6 or 4.4) and refine your guess until you hit 20.For example, 4.5X4.5 = 20.25, so logically you should try a smaller number, probably 4.4. 4.4X4.4 = 19.36. Thus, the square root of 20 must lie in between 4.5 and 4.4. How about 4.445X4.445. That’s 19.758. It’s closer. If you keep trying different numbers using this process, you will eventually get to 4.475X4.475 = 20.03. Rounding off, that’s 20.

, This process also starts with you trying to find the closest whole numbers that your number falls in between.Then, divide your number by one of those square root numbers. Take the answer, and find the average of it and the number you divided by (average is just the sum of those two numbers divided by two). Then take the original number and divide it by the average you got. Finally, find the average of that answer with the first average you got.
Sound complicated? It can be easiest to follow an example. For example, 10 lies in between the 2 perfect square numbers of 9 (3X3=9) and 16 (4X4=16). The square roots of those numbers are 3 and 4. So, divide 10 by the first number, 3. You will get 3.33. Now, average the 3 and 3.33 by adding them together and dividing them by 2. You will get 3.1667. Now take 10 divided by 3.1667. The answer is 3.1579. Now, average 3.1579 and 3.1667 by adding them together and dividing the sum you get by two. You will get 3.1623.
Check your work by multiplying your answer (in this case 3.1623) by itself. Indeed, 3.1623 multiplied by 3.1623 equals 10.001.

Square negative numbers by using the same process.,
Use a calculator after all.",How to Find a Square Root Without a Calculator3," Remember that a negative multiplied by a negative creates a positive. Thus, squaring a negative number will generate a positive number.


For example, -5X-5 =25. However, remember that 5X5=25. So the square root of 25 could be either -5 or 5. Basically, there are two square roots for the number.
Similarly, 3X3=9 and -3X-3=9, so the square root of 9 is both 3 and -3. The positive number is known as the “principal root,” though, so it’s really the only answer you need at this point., It's good to understand how to do math by hand, but there are many online calculators available that specifically calculate square root.


Look for the square root symbol in a traditional calculator too.
The online calculators will simply ask you to enter the number you want to know the square root of and hit a button. The computer will then generate the number's square root."

Learn one table at a time.,
Take your time.You don’t need to sit down and learn all of the multiplication facts at one time.,
Ask family to quiz you on your multiplication tables.",How to Learn Multiplication Facts1," Select one multiplication table to learn at a time. Start with the simple tables such as 2s, 10s, 5s, and 11s. By the time you learn the more difficult tables such as the 7s and 8s, you will already know several facts.Remember, 1 x 4 is the same as 4 x 1 so you only have to learn half of the multiplication table because the other half is just written the other way.;
, In fact, this would be the worst way to learn. Choose a table and focus solely on that one. Take as much time as you need to master each one before moving onto the next one.


Spend about 15-20 minutes each day studying flashcards or playing math games to master each multiplication fact.
There are many multiplication math games with different themes that can be found online.For instance, if you really like dinosaurs, find one that uses dinosaurs to make learning more fun.

, Once you have studied them enough to know them well, ask your family to quiz you on the tables you have just learned. This will help you remember them long term and keep the numbers fresh in your head.


When you have all the tables memorized, ask them to quiz you on all of the numbers, not just one number at a time.

Use the LCM when adding fractions.",How to Find Prime Factorization," Factorization is the process of ""breaking down"" a number into smaller parts. These parts, or factors, multiply with each other to equal the original number.


For example, to factor the number 18, break it into 1 x 18, or into 2 x 9, or into 3 x 6.;
, A prime number only has two factors: itself and 1. The number 5, for example, is the product of 5 and 1. You can't break it down into any other numbers. The goal of prime factorization is to keep breaking a number down until there are only primes left. This is especially useful when handling fractions, making them easier to compare and use in equations., Pick any non-prime number greater than 3. There's no point starting with a prime number, since there's no way to factor it.



Example: In this guide, we'll find the prime factorization of 24.

, Find any two numbers that multiply together to make the number you started with. You can use any two you can think of, but a prime number will make your work easier. One good strategy is to try dividing the number by 2, then 3, then 5, working your way up through the prime numbers until you find one that divides evenly.



Example: If you don't know any factors of 24, try dividing it by small prime numbers. Let's divide by 2 to get 24 = 2 x 12. We're not done yet, but this is a good start.
Since 2 is prime, this is an easy way to start when factoring any even number.

, A factor tree is an easy way to keep track of a factorization problem.To start one, just draw two ""branches"" splitting down from the original number. Write your two factors at the end of these branches.


Example:
   24
    /\
2    12

, Look at your two new numbers (the second line on your factor tree). Are they both primes? If one of them isn't a prime, factor it again the same way. Draw more branches on the tree and write the new factors on a third line.



Example: 12 is not a prime, so we factor it again. Let's use 12 = 2 x 6 and add it to the factor tree:
   24
    /\
2   12
       /\
    2 x 6

, If one of the factors is prime, bring it down onto the next line with its own single ""branch."" There's no way to break it down further, so we're just keeping track of it for now.



Example: 2 is a prime number. Bring the 2 from the second line down to the third.
     24
      /\
   2   12
  /       /\
2     2   6

, Check each new row on the factor tree once you write it. If any of the numbers can be factored again, make a new row. You're finished once there are only prime numbers left.



Example: 6 is a non-prime number and needs to be factored again. 2 is a prime number, so we just bring the 2s down to the next row.
        24
         /\
      2    12
     /       /\
   2     2    6
  /      /      /\
2     2      2   3

, Eventually, you'll only have prime numbers left. When this happens, you're done factoring. The prime factorization is the entire, last line of numbers, written as a multiplication problem.


Check your work by multiplying the last line together. It should equal the original number.

Example: The final line of our factor tree has nothing but 2s and 3s. These are both primes, so we're finished. We can write the prime factorization of 24 as 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3.
The order of the factors does not matter. 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 is also a correct answer.

, If you know how to write exponents, you can make the prime factorization easier to read. Remember, an exponent is a base number, followed by a raised number that states how many times the base is multiplied.



Example: In the factorization 2 x 2 x 2 x 3, how many times does 2 appear? Since the answer is ""three,"" we can simplify 2 x 2 x 2 with 23. The simplified prime factorization is 23 x 3.


, The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that's a factor of both numbers. Here's how to find the GCF of 30 and 36, using prime factorization:


Find the prime factorizations of the two numbers. The prime factorization of 30 is 2 x 3 x 5. The prime factorization of 36 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3.
Find a number that appears on both prime factorizations. Cross it out once on each list and write it on a new line. For example, 2 is on both lists, so we write 2 on a new line. We're left with 30 = 2 x 3 x 5 and 36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3.
Repeat until there are no more factors in common. There's also a 3 on both lists, so write it on your new line to make 2 and 3. Compare 30 = 2 x 3 x 5 and 36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3. There are no more numbers left in common.
To find the GCF, multiply all the shared factors together. We just have 2 and 3 in our example, so the GCF is 2 x 3 = 6. This is the largest number that is both a factor of 30, and a factor of 36.

, Use the Greatest Common Factor whenever you suspect a fraction is not in simplest form. Find the GCF of the numerator and denominator, using the process above. Once you've found it, divide both parts of the fraction by the GCF.The answer will be the same fraction in simplest form.


For example, simplify the fraction 30/36. We already found out that the GCF is 6, so divide both the numerator and denominator by 6:
30 ÷ 6 = 5
36 ÷ 6 = 6

30/36 = 5/6


, The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that has both of the first two numbers as factors. For example, the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, because it has both 2 and 3 as factors. Here's an example of finding LCM from prime factorization:


Start with two prime factorizations. For example, the prime factorization of 126 is 2 x 3 x 3 x 7. The prime factorization of 84 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 7.
For each unique factor, compare the number of times it appears in each list. Pick a list where it appears the greatest number of times, and circle each instance. For example, 2 appears once in the factors of 126, but twice in the list for 84. Circle the 2 x 2 in the second list.
Repeat for each unique factor. For example, 3 appears most often in the first list, so circle the 3 x 3 there. 7 only appears once on each list, so circle a single 7. (It doesn't matter which list you choose when there's a tie.)
Multiply all of your circled numbers together to find the LCM. In our example, the least common multiple of 126 and 84 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 7 = 252. This is the smallest number that has both 126 and 84 as factors.

, Before you can add two fractions together, their denominators must be the same. Find the Least Common Multiple of the two denominators. Multiply each fraction so that the new denominator is the LCM. Once both fractions are in this form, you can add them together.


For example, we want to solve 1/6 + 4/21.
Using the method above, we can find the LCM of 6 and 21. The answer is 42.
Turn 1/6 into a fraction with 42 as the denominator. To do this, solve 42 ÷ 6 = 7. Multiply 1/6 x 7/7 = 7/42.
To turn 4/21 into a fraction with 42 as the denominator, solve 42 ÷ 21 = 2. Multiply 4/21 x 2/2 = 8/42.
Now that we have the fractions in forms with the same denominator, we can add them together easily: 7/42 + 8/42 = 15/42.

Multiply the numbers in the first column by the numbers in the second column, and place the answers in the last column.,
Make more multiplication tables for higher number.",How to Make a Multiplication Table1," This will serve a place holder for your numbers to be multiplied, along with their corresponding numbers.;
, In each cell of the first column of the first table, write the number 1. With multiplication it's important to start small, so use the number 1 as a starter.

, Repeat the second step, but this time, for each cell of the first column of the second table, write the number 2.


Do this for all the remaining tables: number 3 for the third table, number 4 for the fourth table and so on.







, Go back to the first table and write the number 1 in the first cell of the second column.


In the second cell of the second column, write the number 2. Continue all the way down the column until you reach number 10. This is necessary because you need two numbers in order to do multiplication.






Fill in the numbers 1 through 10 for all the second columns of the remaining tables.







, The most traditional sign for multiplication is the symbol x.


But if you want, you can also use other signs like the black point ""●"" which also signifies multiplication.
An equal sign is used to indicate the answer of any operation.

, If you want to be done in a jiffy, you can use a calculator for the answers. But if you want to sharpen your mathematical skills, you can do simple arithmetic:


For the first table – the multiplication table for the number 1 is easy. Any number multiplied to 1 is itself, so you can promptly do multiplication by just copying the numbers 1 through 10 to the third column.
For the number 2 – just double everything! You can use addition here if you find it hard. For example, 2 x 3 is the same as “two threes” so that would be: 3+3 =6.
You can repeat the same technique for all the remaining numbers. For example, 5 x 5, that would be “five fives” so: 5+5+5+5+5= 25.

, If you wish to expand and do tables for higher numbers, you can just repeat the same steps. However, for higher numbers, it is more efficient to find the answers using a calculator rather than writing the numbers out and adding them up.

Add a zero to the product of any number times 10.,
Repeat the digit (up to 9) when multiplying by 11.",How to Learn Multiplication Facts2," The zero multiplication facts are the easiest because every number multiplied by 0 always equals zero.


For example 0 x 1 = 0, 0 x 5 = 0, 0 x 8 = 0, etc.

, The one multiplication facts are easy to learn because when you multiply a number by 1, it is equal to that number. Remember, zero is the exception to this.


For example: 1 x 2 = 2, 1 x 4 = 4, 1 x 7 = 7, etc.

, When learning the multiplication facts for the number two, you may realize that the number being multiplied by 2 is simply added to itself. Instead of memorizing all of the numbers, just add the number to itself and you have learned the multiplication facts for the number two!For example 2 x 4 = 8, but 4 + 4 = 8.
The same goes for every other number, 2 x 3 = 6 (3 +3 =6), 2 x 5 = 10 (5 + 5 = 10), etc.

, The last digit of the product ends in either a 5 or a 0. The pattern starts with 5 and alternates with 0: 5, 0, 5, 0. For example: 5 x 1 = 5, 5 x 2 = 10, 5 x 3 = 15, 5 x 4 = 20, etc. There are two other tricks to help with the 5 facts as well: the product (1) is always half of 10 times that number and (2) is half the number times 10.For example: 5 x 4 = half of (10 x 4). 10 x 4 = 40, half of 40 is 20; 5 x 4 = 20.
Another example: 5 x 4 = (half of 4) x 10, half of 4 is 2, 2 x 10 = 20; 5 x 4 = 20.

, A helpful hint for the 6 multiplication facts is knowing the last digit of the product. This trick only works for even numbers. When you multiply 6 by an even number, the last digit of the product will be that number.For example: 6 x 2 = 12, 6 x 4 = 24, 6 x 6 = 36, 6 x 8 = 48, etc.

, A quick trick for learning the 9 table is to multiply the number by 10, then subtract that number from the product for the final answer.For example: 9 x 4. First multiply 4 x 10 = 40. Then subtract 4 from 40 to get 36. 9 x 4 = 36.
Another example: 9 x 8. 10 x 8 = 80, 80 – 8 = 72. 9 x 8 = 72.
Note the two numbers in the product will add up to 9! For 9 x 4 = 36, 3 + 6 = 9. For 9 x 8 = 72, 7 + 2 = 9. This works for numbers 2 – 9.

, When multiplying by 10, the product is equal to the number followed by a 0 at the end. Again, zero is the exception to this rule (0 x 10 = 0).For example 10 x 2 = 20, 10 x 7 = 70, 10 x 9 = 90, etc.

, The multiplication facts for 11 are pretty simple until you reach the number 10. Simply repeat the number you are multiplying by for the final answer. After 9, you need to memorize that 11 x 10 is 110, and 11 x 12 is 132.For example: 11 x 2 = 22, 11 x 3 = 33, 11 x 4 = 44, etc.

Write out the problem.,
Multiply the whole number by the numerator.,
Divide by the denominator.,
Simplify the improper fraction.,
Write the mixed number.,
Reduce a fraction to its simplest form.",How to Find a Fraction of a Number," If the problem you are working with is a word problem, first you need to write out all of the numbers involved in the calculation. If you were given the numbers written out already, you can skip this step.


For example: What is one-third of seven?
When you see “of” written between two numbers in a word problem, think of it as meaning multiply. Thus, one-third of seven actually means one-third multiplied by seven.
Writing out the problem gives you (1/3) x 7.;
, When working with whole numbers, you will only multiply the number by the numerator (the top number) of the fraction. The denominator remains the same throughout the multiplication process.For example: (1/3) x 7 = 7/3.

, Divide the product by the denominator (the bottom number) of the fraction. At this stage, the fraction might be an improper fraction, meaning that the numerator is larger than the denominator, or it will just need to be reduced.For example: After multiplying, the fraction is 7/3. Three doesn’t divide evenly into seven so you will have a remainder. Three goes into seven twice with one leftover; therefore, the final answer is the mixed number 21/3.

, An improper fraction is one where the numerator is a larger number than the denominator. Always simplify an improper fraction before writing the final answer. To simplify, divide the numerator by the denominator and write the remainder as a fraction.


For example: 10/3

Divide: 10/3 = 9 remainder 1
Write the remainder as a fraction: 1/3


, A mixed number contains both a whole number and a fraction. It is the simplest form of an improper fraction. To write the mixed number, simply write the whole number and the fraction that was created by the remainder.For example: 10/3, 3 goes into 10 3 times with a remainder of 1. The mixed number is 31/3.

, Once you have multiplied through, you need to reduce the fraction. You can divide by a smaller number until the fraction is completely reduced.


For example: Simplify the fraction 4/8. Divide both numbers by four to simplify. The simplest form of 4/8 is 1/2.

Write your number.,
Find two more numbers that multiply to make your first number.,
Determine whether any of your factors can be factored again.,
Stop factoring when you reach prime numbers.,
Factor negative numbers in the same way.",How to Factor a Number1," To begin factoring, all you need is a number - any number will do, but, for our purposes, let's start with a simple integer. Integers are numbers without fractional or decimal components (all positive and negative whole numbers are integers).


Let's choose the number 12. Write this number down on a piece of scratch paper.;
, Any integer can be written as the product of two other integers. Even prime numbers can be written as the product of 1 and the number itself. Thinking of a number as the product of two factors can require ""backwards"" thinking - you essentially must ask yourself, ""what multiplication problem equals this number?""


In our example, 12 has multiple factors - 12 × 1, 6 × 2, and 3 × 4 all equal 12. So, we can say that 12's factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For our purposes, let's work with the factors 6 and 2.
Even numbers are especially easy to factor because every even number has 2 as a factor. 4 = 2 × 2, 26 = 13 × 2, etc.

, Lots of numbers - especially large ones - can be factored multiple times. When you've found two of a number's factors, if one has its own set of factors, you can reduce this number to its factors as well. Depending on the situation, it may or may not be beneficial to do this.


For instance, in our example, we have reduced 12 to 2 × 6. Notice that 6 has its own factors - 3 × 2 = 6. Thus, we can say that 12 = 2 × (3 × 2).

, Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are evenly divisible only by themselves and 1. For instance, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 are all prime numbers. When you've factored a number so that it's the product of exclusively prime numbers, further factoring is superfluous. It does you no good to reduce each factor to itself times one, so you may stop.


In our example, we've reduced 12 to 2 × (2 × 3). 2, 2, and 3 are all prime numbers. If we were to factor further, we'd have to factor to (2 × 1) × ((2 × 1)(3 × 1)), which isn't typically useful, so it's usually avoided.

, Negative numbers can be factored nearly identically to how positive numbers are factored. The sole difference is that the factors must multiply together to make a negative number as their product, so an odd number of the factors must be negative.


For example, let's factor -60. See below:

-60 = -10 × 6
-60 = (-5 × 2) × 6
-60 = (-5 × 2) × (3 × 2)
-60 = -5 × 2 × 3 × 2. Note that having an odd number of negative numbers besides one will give the same product. For example, -5 × 2 × -3 × -2 also equals 60.

Write the two digit numbers next to each other as so:


97 x 93

Note: This example is for two-digit numbers that start with the same number and have second digits that equal 10 when added together (in this example, both numbers start with 9 and the second digits, 7 and 3, have a sum of 10).,
First, we multiply the two second digits together.,
Place this result to the right-hand side of the final answer.,
Now add 1 to the first digit of the first number:


9 + 1 = 10

,
Multiply 10 by the first digit of the second number:


10 x 9 = 90

,
Place this result on the left-hand side of the final answer, and you'll see that you have quickly calculated the correct answer to the original problem.,
Take another set of two-digit numbers to be multiplied.,
Above each number, right the difference, or how deficient each of the numbers is from 100.,

,
Now that we are above 100, right down how much higher each number is from 100.,
Cross-add these numbers from the value on the other side of the multiplication sign.,
Place this number to the left-hand side of the final answer


Now you can see that the final answer will look like 107xx

,
Multiply the two differences together.,
Place this number to the right-hand side of the final answer, and even here you'll be able see that you have quickly calculated the correct answer.",How to Do Vedic Math Shortcut Multiplication,";
, In this case that would be:


7 x 3 = 21

,


Here you can see that the final answer will look like xx21

,,,


9021

, Keep in mind that the first digits are the same and the sum of the second digits equals 10.


98 x 92

,


98 is -2 from 100, so write -2 above 98
92 is -8 from 100, so write -8 above 92

, You will see that it results in the same number.


98 - 8 = 90
92 - 2 = 90

,,


-2 x -8 = 16

,

Write your number above a 2-column table.,
Divide your number by the smallest possible prime factor.,
Continue to factor in this fashion.,
Deal with odd numbers by trying small prime factors.,
Continue until you reach 1.,
Use the numbers in the left-hand column as your original number's factors.",How to Factor a Number2," While it's usually fairly easy to factor small integers, larger numbers can be daunting. Most of us would be hard-pressed to break a 4 or 5-digit number into its prime factors using nothing but mental math. Luckily, using a table, the process becomes much easier. Write your number above a t-shaped table with two columns - you'll use this table to keep track of your growing list of factors.


For the purpose of our example, let's choose a 4-digit number to factor - 6,552.

, Divide your number by the smallest prime factor (besides 1) that divides into it evenly with no remainder. Write the prime factor in the left column and write your answer across from it in the right column. As noted above, even numbers are especially easy to start factoring because their smallest prime factor will always be 2. Odd numbers, on the other hand, will have smallest prime factors that differ.


In our example, since 6,552 is even, we know that 2 is its smallest prime factor. 6,552 ÷ 2 = 3,276. In the left column, we'll write 2, and in the right column, write 3,276.

, Next, factor the number in the right column by its smallest prime factor, rather than the number at the top of the table. Write the prime factor in the left column and the new number in the right column. Continue to repeat this process - with each repetition, the number in the right column should decrease.


Let's continue with our process. 3,276 ÷ 2 = 1,638, so att the bottom of the left column, we'll write another 2, and at the bottom of the right column, we'll write 1,638. 1,638 ÷ 2 = 819, so we'll write 2 and 819 at the bottom of the two columns as before.

, Odd numbers are more difficult to find the smallest prime factor of than even numbers because they don't automatically have 2 as their smallest prime factor. When you reach an odd number, try dividing by small prime numbers other than 2 - 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on - until you find one that divides evenly with no remainder. This is the number's smallest prime factor.


In our example, we've reached 819. 819 is odd, so 2 is not a factor of 819. Instead of writing down another 2, we'll try the next prime number: 3. 819 ÷ 3 = 273 with no remainder, so we'll write down 3 and 273.
When guessing factors, you should try all prime numbers up to the square root of the largest factor found so far. If none of the factors you try up to this point divide evenly, you're probably trying to factor a prime number and thus are finished with the factoring process.

, Continue dividing the numbers in the right column by their smallest prime factor until you obtain a prime number in the right column. Divide this number by itself - this will put the number in the left column and ""1"" in the right column.


Let's finish factoring our number. See below for a detailed breakdown:

Divide by 3 again: 273 ÷ 3 = 91, no remainder, so we'll write down 3 and 91.
Let's try 3 again: 91 doesn't have 3 as a factor, nor does it have the next lowest prime (5) as a factor, but 91 ÷ 7 = 13, with no remainder, so we'll write down 7 and 13.
Let's try 7 again: 13 doesn't have 7 as a factor, or 11 (the next prime), but it does have itself as a factor: 13 ÷ 13 = 1. So, to finish our table, we'll write down 13 and 1. We can finally stop factoring.



, Once you reach 1 in the right-hand column, you're done. The numbers listed on the left side of the table are your factors. In other words, the product when you multiply all of these numbers together will be the number at the top of the table. If the same factor appears multiple times, you can use exponent notation to save space. For instance, if your list of factors has four 2's, you can write 24 rather than 2 × 2 × 2 × 2.


In our example 6,552 = 23 × 32 × 7 × 13. This is the complete factorization of 6,552 into prime numbers. No matter what order these numbers are multiplied in, the product will be 6,552.

Replace 9 with 10.,
Subtract that number from the product.",How to Learn the 9's on the Multiplication Table2," Multiply the number by 10, instead of 9.

, For example: 9x1 turns into 10x1-1 = 9, 9x8 turns into 10x8-8 = 72, 9x27 = 10x27-27 = 243.


Another example: For 7x9, do (7 x 10) - 7 = 70 - 7 = 63.
Note: subtracting that 7 or whatever number, gets rid of the tenth factor (removes the extra multiple).

Get your materials.,
Write 9*1=0 on the first row.,
Write 9*2=1 on the second row, and so on.,
Pair the first and last rows.,
Continue matching the pairs of rows.",How to Learn the 9's on the Multiplication Table4," This will be a piece of paper and a pencil. Or a dry erase board and marker—basically anything you can write on and something to write with., This intermediate step gives the tens digit of the final answer.

Notice that the digit you record (the tens digit for your answer) is 1 less than the integer number you are using to multiply 9 by.
The general expression for the list you are forming is 9*n=n-1.

, Continue until you reach 10., The tens digit from the partner row will be the ones digit for the other row. In this case, you have the first row: 9*1=0 and the last row 9*10=9. You will take the 9 from 9*10=9 as the units digit to give 9*1=09.

Similarly, you will take the 0 from 9*1=0 as the units digit for its partner to give 10*9=90.

, The process is the same: Take the first and last unsolved rows as a pair. Then the tens digit from the partner row becomes the units digit for the row you are solving.

The sum of the tens digit and the units digit for each answer will always be 9. So, knowing the the tens digit is for 9*6=5, will enable you to write the corresponding ones digit as 4 (9-5)

Check for negative numbers and ones.,
Convert the expression into one logarithm.,
Calculate by hand if possible.,
Leave the answer in logarithm form if you cannot simplify it.",How to Divide Logarithms1," This method covers problems in the form logb⁡(x)logb⁡(a){\displaystyle {\frac {\log _{b}(x)}{\log _{b}(a)}}}. However, it does not work for a few special cases:The log of a negative number is undefined for all bases (such as log⁡(−3){\displaystyle \log(-3)} or log4⁡(−5){\displaystyle \log _{4}(-5)}). Write ""no solution.""

The log of zero is also undefined for all bases. If you see a term such as ln⁡(0){\displaystyle \ln(0)}, write ""no solution.""

The log of one in any base (log⁡(1){\displaystyle \log(1)}) always equals zero, since x0=1{\displaystyle x^{0}=1} for all values of x. Replace that logarithm with 1 instead of using the method below.

If the two logarithms have different bases, such as log3(x)log4(a){\displaystyle {\frac {log_{3}(x)}{log_{4}(a)}}}, and you cannot simplify either one into an integer, the problem is not feasible to solve by hand.
;
, Assuming you did not find any of the exceptions above, you can now simplify the problem into one logarithm. To do this, use the formula logb⁡(x)logb⁡(a)=loga⁡(x){\displaystyle {\frac {\log _{b}(x)}{\log _{b}(a)}}=\log _{a}(x)}.

Example 1: Solve the problem log16log2{\displaystyle {\frac {\log {16}}{\log {2}}}}.Start by converting this into one logarithm using the formula above: log16log2=log2⁡(16){\displaystyle {\frac {\log {16}}{\log {2}}}=\log _{2}(16)}.

This formula is the ""change of base"" formula, derived from basic logarithmic properties.


, Remember, to solve loga⁡(x){\displaystyle \log _{a}(x)}, think ""a?=x{\displaystyle a^{?}=x}"" or ""What exponent can I raise a by to get x?"" It's not always feasible to solve this without a calculator, but if you're lucky, you'll end up with an easily simplified logarithm.

Example 1 (cont.): Rewrite log2⁡(16){\displaystyle \log _{2}(16)} as 2?=16{\displaystyle 2^{?}=16}. The value of ""?"" is the answer to the problem. You may need to find it by trial and error:22=2∗2=4{\displaystyle 2^{2}=2*2=4}23=4∗2=8{\displaystyle 2^{3}=4*2=8}24=8∗2=16{\displaystyle 2^{4}=8*2=16}16 is what you were looking for, so log2⁡(16){\displaystyle \log _{2}(16)} = 4.


, Some logarithms are very difficult to solve by hand. You'll need a calculator if you need the answer for a practical purpose. If you're solving problems in math class, your teacher most likely expects you to leave the answer as a logarithm. Here's another example using this method on a more difficult problem:

Example 2: What is log3⁡(58)log3⁡(7){\displaystyle {\frac {\log _{3}(58)}{\log _{3}(7)}}}?

Convert this into one logarithm: log3⁡(58)log3⁡(7)=log7⁡(58){\displaystyle {\frac {\log _{3}(58)}{\log _{3}(7)}}=\log _{7}(58)}. (Notice that the 3 in each initial log disappears; this is true for any base.)

Rewrite as 7?=58{\displaystyle 7^{?}=58} and test possible values of ?:72=7∗7=49{\displaystyle 7^{2}=7*7=49}73=49∗7=343{\displaystyle 7^{3}=49*7=343}Since 58 falls between these two numbers, log7⁡(58){\displaystyle \log _{7}(58)} has no integer answer.

Leave your answer as log7⁡(58){\displaystyle \log _{7}(58)}.

Solve the first exponential expression.,
Solve the second exponential expression.,
Add the two values together.",How to Add Exponents1," An exponential expression has a base (large number) and exponent (small number). The exponent tells you how many times to multiply the base by itself (23=2×2×2{\displaystyle 2^{3}=2\times 2\times 2}).For example, if your problem is 34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}}, you would first calculate 34{\displaystyle 3^{4}}:34{\displaystyle 3^{4}}=3×3×3×3{\displaystyle =3\times 3\times 3\times 3}=81{\displaystyle =81}
;
, To do this, multiply the base by itself the number of times indicated by the exponent.

For example, the problem is now 81+25{\displaystyle 81+2^{5}}, so you need to calculate 25{\displaystyle 2^{5}}:25{\displaystyle 2^{5}}=2×2×2×2×2{\displaystyle =2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2}=32{\displaystyle =32}


, This will give you the sum of the two exponential expressions.

For example:34+25{\displaystyle 3^{4}+2^{5}}=(3×3×3×3)+(2×2×2×2×2){\displaystyle =(3\times 3\times 3\times 3)+(2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2)}=(81)+(32){\displaystyle =(81)+(32)}=113{\displaystyle =113}
